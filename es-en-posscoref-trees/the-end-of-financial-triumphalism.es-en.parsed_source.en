The End of Financial Triumphalism ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Will today &apos;s ever widening global financial crisis mark the end of the era of financial triumphalism ? 
Ask a lay person to list the ten great innovations that drive our world today and you probably won &apos;t find too many who mention the Black-Scholes formula for pricing options . 
But for the financial community , pioneering formulas that paved the way for modern hedging strategies should get just as much credit for the passing period of rapid global growth as cell phones , computers , and the Internet . 
Until the last 12 months , finance advocates seemed to have a strong case . 
By helping to spread risk , high-tech finance could help economies grow faster . 
Macroeconomists celebrated the &quot; Great Moderation &quot; of the global business cycle , with recessions seeming to become milder and less frequent . 
And , of course , the financial community was making money hand over fist , creating scores of millionaires and even billionaires worldwide . 
Governments were cheerleaders , too . 
In anglophone countries , presidents and prime ministers , not to mention some leading central bankers , boasted of superior financial systems that were the envy of the world . 
When French and German leaders complained that the sprawling and unregulated tentacles of new finance posed huge risks to the global economy , they were derided as sore losers . 
Small countries such as Iceland decided to get in on the action by privatizing their banks and setting up their own financial centers . 
If you cannot be Silicon Valley , then why not create a mini-Wall Street ? 
Now Iceland &apos;s banks , having borrowed several times the national GDP , are in desperate trouble , with debts far beyond what the small country &apos;s taxpayers can absorb . 
Even the conservative Swiss gave into the temptations of high-tech finance and the riches it promised . 
Today , the two largest Swiss banks are sinking in liabilities that exceed seven times the country &apos;s income . 
Of course , the mother of all bailouts is the absurd blank check the United States government is granting the giant home mortgage lending agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which hold or guarantee $ 5 trillion in mortgages that are looking increasingly dubious . 
It is ironic indeed that US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , a former head of Goldman Sachs , a firm that exemplifies financial triumphalism , is spearheading the effort to save government-sponsored behemoths that have so conspicuously outlived their usefulness . 
Advances in the field of finance have potentially had a beneficial impact in raising and smoothing global growth . 
But there is also a cyclical element to the flowering of finance . 
When home prices were soaring , the geniuses behind mortgage finance seemed infallible . 
Now that prices are falling , the genius strategies don &apos;t seem quite so brilliant . 
It is an old story . 
Back in the early 1980 &quot; s , financial engineers invented &quot; portfolio insurance , &quot; a fancy active hedging strategy for controlling downside risk . 
They made piles of money . 
Unfortunately , when global stock markets crashed in October 1987 , the insurance turned out to be useless , mainly because markets for hedging collapsed . 
In the late 1990 &quot; s , the US hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management convinced the world that its partners were masters of the universe . 
For a while , it consistently made outsized profits , supposedly due to its Nobel-prize backed financial expertise . 
In 1998 , when LTCM went bust , it became all too clear that the firm was basically making massive quantities of simple bond trades , with huge leverage and huge risk . 
For governments , the key to success in regulating financial markets lies in maintaining reasonable constraints during boom times that prevent taxpayer funds from being put excessively at risk . 
Unfortunately , this is difficult to do , because boom times make people who warn of risks seems like doom mongers . 
That is why it is so important that governments allow financial firms to fail occasionally . 
Is the current gilded era of financial triumphalism over ? 
There is talk in many countries , even the US , that the time has come to ensure that the entire financial system , including hedge funds and investment banks , become subject to much stricter regulation . 
Financial firms are screaming murder , but it is not obvious that broader and better financial regulation would be a bad thing . 
In my research on the history of international financial crisis with Professor Carmen Reinhart , we find that eras of heavy financial regulation tend to have significantly fewer financial crises than lightly regulated free-wheeling eras , such as those associated with the recent period of financial triumphalism . 
No one is suggesting that we go back to the &quot; financial repression &quot; of the 1950 &quot; s , but the latest crisis has left little doubt that the entire system for global financial regulation is in serious need of an update . 
Financial innovation ought to be allowed to flourish , but not without better checks and balances . 
Otherwise , we will be forever trapped in a framework where taxpayers are forced to bail out banks in bad times , while wealthy shareholders reap huge profits in good times . 
It is time to leaven financial triumphalism with some humility and common sense .
