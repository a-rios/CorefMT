A New Approach to North Korea 
SEOUL - The long-delayed meeting of North Korea &apos;s ruling Worker &apos;s Party is now underway , and comes at a time of severe tension between North Korea and the international community . 
It is widely expected that Kim Jong-il &apos;s third son , Kim Jong-eun , will be appointed to a key position and be publicly announced as his father &apos;s successor . 
There are also hints that a reshuffling of important positions within the Party will take place , allowing the presumed heir to form a new power base . 
Whatever happens , and whoever turns out to be the new leader , North Korea most likely faces an unstable future . 
The cost of maintaining internal order will continue to rise as the system &apos;s fundamental defects force the new leader to confront stark new challenges . 
Moreover , responsibility for managing that potential instability extends far beyond the leadership in Pyongyang . 
North Korea &apos;s fragility is suggested by the fact that even such an important political event as the Worker &apos;s Party conference , held for the first time in three decades , was abruptly postponed earlier in September . 
One cause for the delay could be a schism within the ruling elite , a group that &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong-il himself cannot control as effectively as before . 
Moreover , Kim &apos;s health problems might have worsened much faster than outsiders guess , further complicating matters . 
&quot; Enough is enough , &quot; a mid-level North Korean government official recently uttered in a private conversation with a South Korean visitor to Pyongyang regarding Kim Jong-eun &apos;s likely succession . 
Ordinary North Koreans , too , evidently seem to view this succession differently from that of Kim Jong-il &apos;s inheritance of power from his father , Kim Il-sung . 
Moreover , there is no hope that any new leader , whoever it may be , will get any breathing space to establish unquestioned control , given the economy &apos;s utter state of decay , as last year &apos;s failed bid to reform the currency demonstrated . 
The regime is under growing pressure from those at the bottom of North Korean society , and recognizes its own inability to handle the situation . 
For example , for the first time , North Korea &apos;s prime minister publicly apologized for a policy error - the failure of the currency redenomination . 
For the dynamics of the relationship between North Korea &apos;s people and its rulers seems to be changing fundamentally . 
One troubling aspect of this change is that the new leader may feel the need to resort to brute force more frequently in order to suppress popular resistance . 
And , at a time of domestic hardship and diplomatic isolation , North Korea &apos;s leaders , their confidence boosted by their possession of nuclear weapons , might try to distract their public through audacious , and possibly destructive , acts abroad . 
The attack on the South Korean naval ship Cheonan earlier this year may be a grim sign of things to come . 
Indeed , the North Korean threat nowadays derives more from the regime &apos;s internal weaknesses than from its aggressive external posture - the latter being the authorities &quot; fearful response to the former . 
Unfortunately , however , most international efforts have sought to ameliorate the symptoms rather than cure the underlying disease . 
Of course , in order to pressure North Korea &apos;s government to give up its nuclear option , the current international economic sanctions , which target WMD-related products and luxury goods , probably should continue . 
But , at the same time , the international community should place greater emphasis on policies aimed at inducing North Korea to launch serious economic reform . 
At a time of increased tension between North Korea , South Korea , and the United States such a policy may seem impossible to undertake . 
Yet a road map for a peaceful transition can be designed . 
If , say , North Korea is willing to respect international standards of economic behavior , it could be invited to join the International Monetary Fund . 
Western governments also could permit charitable foundations to provide North Korean officials or students with scholarships to study abroad and learn how to run a market economy . 
Of course , any assistance to North Korea would have to be monitored closely to prevent it from being diverted for military or other political purposes . 
The international community would lose nothing by trying this approach and testing the regime &apos;s will to reform . 
In fact , following the recent currency fiasco , North Korean leaders may have become more open to economic reform than ever before . 
Such an approach is also compatible with Chinese policy , which has been to pressure North Korea to adopt its model of economic reform . 
To be sure , North Korea &apos;s regime is not the only obstacle to international engagement . 
Conservatives in both the United States and South Korea may argue that North Korea must first move toward denuclearization before any kind of economic assistance is offered . 
But there is no reason why international efforts to ensure North Korea &apos;s denuclearization must preclude policies aimed at bringing about domestic reform . 
We need not assume that these goals cannot be pursued simultaneously . 
On the contrary , it may be impossible to win North Korea &apos;s assent to denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching domestic change . 
The past two decades have shown that &quot; politically correct &quot; decisions do not produce the &quot; right &quot; results , even in the long run . 
As North Korea grooms a new leader , the world needs to groom a new policy for North Korea .
