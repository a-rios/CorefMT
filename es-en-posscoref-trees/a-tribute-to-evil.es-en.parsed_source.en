A Tribute to Evil 
In May , the world will mark the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe . 
But instead of happily preparing for that occasion , the Baltic countries of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania - which scarcely 15 years ago regained the independence they lost in WWII - are uneasy . 
The heads of state of all three countries have been invited to participate in the parades to be held in Moscow to celebrate the Red Army &apos;s victory over Nazi Germany . 
But the host of the celebration , Russia , in the guise of the Soviet Union , itself caused the war - the bloodiest in European history - whose end is being commemorated . 
Of course , the USSR instigated the war in tandem with Adolf Hitler , but its responsibility is undeniable . 
By holding these celebrations in Red Square , and thus highlighting the Soviet victory , today &apos;s Russia is also celebrating its gains in that war . 
One of those gains was my country , Lithuania , whose incorporation into Stalin &apos;s empire was accompanied by countless tragedies . 
Unlike Germany , Russia has never recognized its responsibility for the war and the mass graves of the innocent . 
Thus , a former captive nation is now being invited to celebrate its captivity . 
This is why almost all Lithuanians - indeed , most residents of the Baltic countries - feel queasy at the prospect of their leaders marking this anniversary in Moscow . 
But Estonians , Latvians , and Lithuanians are not the only Europeans who should feel this way . 
When Stalin offered Hitler his friendship in the spring of 1939 - formally concluded that summer in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact - Nazi aggression was assured of not being knifed in the back from the East and so was left with free hands to do as Hitler pleased in the West . 
The Pact came after the pogroms of &quot; Kristallnacht &quot; in Germany , so its Soviet initiators knew pretty well to what destiny they were consigning the Jews of Poland and Lithuania , which , in accord with the first secret Protocol signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov on August 23 , 1939 , were to go to Hitler . 
A month later , in equal secrecy , Hitler sold Lithuania to Stalin . 
The other countries situated between Germany and the USSR were similarly sentenced to disappear as nations - sooner or later . 
Their peoples were treated practically as though they did not exist ; the aggressors &quot; only concern was territory . 
The death sentences and torturing that were then imposed on almost entire nations and millions of people are , it now appears , to be silently accepted and noisily celebrated on May 9 in Moscow . 
Some Russian officials want to unveil a monument Stalin to crown the festivities . 
When Hitler &apos;s Wehrmacht struck West , the USSR duly supported Germany in its war against Poland , France , Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , Denmark , Norway , and the United Kingdom . 
As a result , cities in those countries were flattened and people killed not only by the Nazis , but also by their Soviet ally , which invaded Poland and supplied the Wehrmacht with the material it needed for its war against the West . 
In return , Stalin &apos;s USSR was given a free hand to attack Finland and to occupy Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania , as well as a part of Romania . 
In law , when two criminals seal a contract with the blood of their victims , that act remains a crime , even if the two criminals later have a falling out and spray bullets at one another . 
The same applies to the two greatest European criminals of the twentieth century . 
We must not forget the crimes that Hitler and Stalin committed together as de facto allies only because they later turned on each other . 
The blood of WWII &apos;s victims calls for justice and fairness , but most of all it demands honesty about who and what caused their tragic fate . 
If those who gather in Moscow on May 9 do anything to validate Soviet war crimes , they will show themselves insensitive to the silent cries of WWII &apos;s tens of millions of dead innocents . 
The only real winner would be the spirit of that evil .
