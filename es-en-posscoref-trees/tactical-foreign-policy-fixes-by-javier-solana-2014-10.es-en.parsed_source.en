The Years of Living Tactically 
MADRID - We have been living in an illusion . 
For years , the world has believed that the transition from a unipolar to a multipolar order would be peaceful , orderly , and steady , with new players like China , Brazil , and Turkey adapting to the existing multilateral framework in a natural , harmonious way . 
How wrong we were . 
The 2008 global financial crisis compounded uncertainty and mistrust , disrupting key trends like globalization . 
But the biggest problem has been the failure of the developed countries - the architects of the post-World War II international order - to formulate an inclusive strategy to address global challenges and manage the transition to a new international system . 
The reason for this failure is simple : the West has allowed short-term tactical concerns to impede the development of a long-term strategic vision . 
This obsession with tactics has affected governance at all levels , from local administrations to supranational institutions , allowing major actors to operate within uncoordinated realities , without any shared goals guiding their decision-making . 
To be sure , there have been some noteworthy exceptions , owing to concerted efforts to consolidate a constructive strategic vision . 
For example , Western policy has yielded some progress toward a resolution regarding Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
But , in other areas , strategic thinking has fallen short . 
In Ukraine , for example , the conflict has both exposed and widened the fissure between Russia and the West . 
Post-Soviet Russia &apos;s struggle to integrate into the international order , together with its rejection of modernization , has fueled a revisionist nationalism based on spheres of influence . 
And it is not just Russia that has turned its back on Western modernity . 
The Middle East has been a hotbed of instability fueled by historical tensions since the fall of the Ottoman Empire almost a century ago . 
Now it is on fire - not least because the West &apos;s repeated interventions have been guided by shortsighted tactical concerns . 
Indeed , Western leaders failed to anticipate the long-term consequences of supporting autocracies , revealed in the Arab Spring revolts , or to foresee the impact of successive military interventions in Iraq , Syria , and Libya . 
As a result , nostalgia for the &quot; glorious &quot; past - such as the Islamic State &apos;s caliphate envy - is proliferating in the Middle East , too . 
The West was not prepared for global forces to push backward and to seek a future in the past . 
In any case , the Middle East must be allowed to take ownership of solutions to the challenges it faces ; after all , no externally imposed solution has worked so far . 
The responsibility of the rest of the world is to build a stable backdrop for such efforts : an inclusive international system in which countries abide by the same rules and norms . 
In managing the transition toward multipolarity , the West &apos;s greatest challenge lies in Asia - a region that is simultaneously dynamic and future-oriented and hampered by historical tensions and divides . 
Recognizing Asia &apos;s profound importance to the new world order , US President Barack Obama announced a strategic &quot; pivot &quot; toward the region in 2012 . 
But Western leaders have hesitated to integrate China , Asia &apos;s most economically formidable actor , into the international system . 
Indeed , the last meeting of the International Monetary Fund - which recognized China as the world &apos;s largest economy by purchasing power parity - concluded without increasing China &apos;s share of votes . 
To put this in perspective , China was left with a slightly higher proportion of votes than Italy , whose economy is one-fifth the size , and just one-quarter of America &apos;s vote share . 
Moreover , the West has relegated support for the creation and strengthening of regional frameworks for cooperation in key areas like security to secondary importance . 
Unlike Europe , Asia &apos;s wounds from WWII never healed . 
As a result , territorial disputes and nationalist claims remain a potent threat to regional - indeed global - stability . 
But , for the West , applying long-term vision requires more than recognizing the imperative of strategic decision-making ; it also demands efforts to revitalize polarized and dysfunctional domestic political systems . 
In the United States , there is no question that the lack of strategic vision displayed in Obama &apos;s foreign policy is at least partly a result of his need to navigate a defective system . 
For its part , the European Union has pursued shortsighted policies to address its economic challenges , without anticipating - or acknowledging - the social and political consequences , including the proliferation of anti-EU sentiment . 
Member states &quot; tactical approach to their particular problems ( often defined by their status as creditor or debtor ) has left the EU bereft of credible leadership and a unified vision . 
A more strategic approach would focus on boosting growth throughout the EU , such as by meeting the Europe 2020 targets for research , development , and innovation , and advancing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership . 
Tactics are short-term solutions that often have significant unforeseen consequences , making it impossible to predict the kind of world they will generate . 
Strategy forms a different axis of action , accounting for the structure of global interdependence and thus how individual changes may affect the entire system . 
Only by moving to this axis of strategy can we achieve the world we want : one that is habitable , stable , free , and prosperous .
