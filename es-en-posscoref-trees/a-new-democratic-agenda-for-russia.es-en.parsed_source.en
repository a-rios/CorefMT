A New Democratic Agenda for Russia 
MOSCOW - When Russian President Dmitri Medvedev delivered his annual address to the Federal Assembly I was struck by the fact that his speech seemed to be meant for an advanced , prosperous country , not the real Russia of today . 
Russia will hold a presidential election in 2012 . 
What happens in 2011 will , in my opinion , be even more important than the election itself . 
Indeed , the evolution of Russian society could transform Russian politics , despite those domestic opponents who deny change or those who unqualifiedly classify Russia as &quot; incorrigibly authoritarian . &quot; 
But , in order for that to happen , a new agenda for Russia must be developed this year . 
A decade ago , defense of Russia &apos;s territorial integrity and restoration of governability topped the list of priorities . 
People supported a president , Vladimir Putin , who was devoted to this &quot; stabilization &quot; agenda . 
We may debate the means by which it was pursued , and how successfully , but Russia &apos;s &quot; existential &quot; challenges were largely overcome . 
But progress on stabilization only highlighted Russia &apos;s unresolved problems , which the global financial crisis exacerbated , but did not cause . 
After all , Russia &apos;s resource-based , de-industrializing , expenditure-driven economy is the result of purely domestic choices . 
Nor was it the crisis that gave rise to corruption , which affects officialdom at all levels , or that caused Russia to lose its democratic dynamic . 
We Russians rode along on oil and gas , forgetting that these resources will not last forever . 
But , even with favorable world market conditions , we did not manage to solve the problem of poverty , in which millions of Russians still live . 
I am convinced that Russia &apos;s troubles all come down to politics . 
We need a democratic , competitive environment , initiative at all levels , an active civil society , and real public control . 
Only under such conditions will difficult problems lend themselves to solution . 
But , starting in 2005-2006 , the authorities implemented measures that made responsiveness to acute problems practically impossible . 
The decisions to appoint , rather than elect , regional governors , to introduce party-list voting , to raise the electoral threshold for parties to enter the Duma , and to repeal the minimum-turnout requirement - all accompanied by rampant manipulation of elections and the mass media - created a political system closed to feedback from society . 
Not surprisingly , the political elite became self-absorbed and served only its own narrow interests . 
This summer , with wildfires raging outside Moscow , the elite &apos;s isolation took on a menacing nature . 
But something else happened : society became more demanding , recognizing its own interests and knowing how to express them . 
Although the traditions of self-organization in Russian society are neither deep nor strong , real movement in this direction became visible for all to see . 
Activists from public movements , journalists , ecologists , businessmen , and ordinary people who had suffered the tyranny and corruption of public officials began to join in . 
The authorities have recognized this , at least to some degree . 
Medvedev &apos;s decision to suspend construction of a highway through the Khimki forest near Moscow in the face of widespread civic protest was important . 
For many months , Moscow and federal authorities ignored the highway &apos;s opponents , so Medvedev &apos;s decision was a signal : contempt for the people is inadmissible . 
Yet right after that , the bureaucracy tried to turn the public hearings - called to give people and civil institutions a voice in solving such problems - into an empty formality . 
So the struggle between democratic and anti-democratic tendencies is becoming acute . 
If the anti-democratic tendencies win out , all that we have accomplished in previous years will be jeopardized - including stability itself . 
This threat evidently motivated Medvedev to speak out in November : &quot; It is no secret , &quot; Medvedev wrote in his blog , &quot; that , as of a certain period , symptoms of stagnation have begun to appear in our political life , and the threat of turning stability into a factor of stagnation has appeared . &quot; 
The president &apos;s statement was unexpected . 
Medvedev &apos;s assessment attested to his understanding that Russia &apos;s problems are rooted in its politics - in the degradation of the ruling party , in the absence of a real opposition , and in the lack of respect for the rights of political minorities . 
I welcome Medvedev &apos;s emphasis on social concerns and his anti-bureaucratic rhetoric . 
But his statements are only a first step toward formulating a new Russian agenda , the first point of which must be a renewal and acceleration of movement toward real and effective democracy . 
It is vital that Russians believe that Medvedev &apos;s words reflect his priorities , and that he is prepared to fight for them . 
Among these priorities , one of the most important is education . 
We have approached the point when the constitutional requirement of universal , free education may become a fiction . 
People are asking : How is it that , after World War II , the state had enough money to provide free education , whereas today &apos;s Russian state does not ? 
Society also demands effective mechanisms for combating corruption , which is turning into a serious political problem , precisely because it has widened the gap between the people and the authorities . 
Indeed , today &apos;s elite cannot or will not solve the problem . 
Only a serious presidential initiative , supported by civil society and brave new political forces , can do the job . 
The new agenda must also include a strong economic component . 
Patching up holes in the budget and individual initiatives are not enough to ensure economic renewal . 
Russia needs a breakthrough toward an up-to-date , knowledge-based , and ecologically sustainable economy . 
Here , I see a direct connection with the problem of education . 
I am convinced that Medvedev must become the leader in the process of formulating the new Russian agenda , and he must act in the coming year . 
Society will support him .
