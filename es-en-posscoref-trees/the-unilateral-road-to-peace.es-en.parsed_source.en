The Unilateral Road to Peace 
In the next three weeks , the Israeli army will do something unprecedented : instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorism , it will evacuate - by force if necessary - 9,000 Israelis from their homes . 
Israel &apos;s unilateral withdrawal is the outcome of a deep political shift that has been caused by two somewhat contradictory convictions that have characterized Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s policies since 2003 : first , that the US-initiated &quot; road map &quot; is going nowhere and , second , that the status quo is untenable . 
Certainly , according to Sharon &apos;s thinking , there is no future for 9,000 Jewish settlers living among 1.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip . 
Hence , in the absence of negotiations , a unilateral withdrawal is the only meaningful step towards de-escalation and stabilization . 
This policy has deeply divided Israel : the settlers - mostly , but not exclusively religious - feel betrayed by Sharon , &quot; The Father of the Settlements . &quot; 
It is now the Israeli left that , however reluctantly , realizes that Sharon &apos;s new pragmatism may be the first step in the right direction . 
Like de Gaulle in Algeria , Sharon has reshuffled the cards of Israel &apos;s politics . 
The last weeks have seen massive demonstrations , some of them verging on violence ; many of the settlers have declared that they will not obey government orders to evacuate . 
The army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions . 
This forcible approach is traumatic not only for the settlers , but also for many other Israelis . 
Only the next days and weeks will tell whether the evacuation proceeds peacefully or not . 
In the meantime , Sharon has paid heavily for his policies . 
Two right-wing parties have left his ruling coalition , he has lost his majority within his own Likud Party , and his finance minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , has quit his government . 
Only by bringing Shimon Peres &apos;s Labor Party into his cabinet did Sharon manage to retain his parliamentary majority . 
The question , of course , is what will happen after the Gaza disengagement . 
Many governments were initially skeptical about disengagement , but realized that - as the Washington saying goes - &quot; this is the only game in town . &quot; 
Among them , as well as among the Palestinians , one hears the hope that after the Gaza withdrawal , it will be possible to return to the road map and to resume negotiations leading to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians . 
This is a major mistake . 
While motivated by the best of intentions , the hope of reviving the road map is out of touch with reality . 
Future negotiations will have to deal with the ultimate borders between Israel and Palestine , the fate of 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank , the status of Jerusalem , and with the problem of the 1947-48 Palestinian refugees . 
On all of these issues , the gulf between the Israeli and Palestinian positions has not narrowed since the failed negotiations at Camp David in 2000 , while fear and distrust have increased . 
To attempt negotiations under these circumstances would not only be an exercise in futility , but may merely deepen alienation and suspicion on both sides . 
The failure of the Annan Plan for Cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough - and the disagreements in Cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides Israelis and Palestinians . 
So what can be done ? 
Probably the only rational way to proceed would be to acknowledge that unilateral steps on both sides can still further the cause of de-escalation and ultimate reconciliation . 
On the Israeli side , further disengagement from dozens of isolated and small settlements on the West Bank , entailing the evacuation of between 20,000 and 30,000 settlers , may be politically feasible and would give the Palestinians a contiguous territory on the West Bank . 
On the Palestinian side , consolidation of the Palestinian Authority &apos;s control over a dozen security services and militias would be an important step . 
The Palestinian leader , Abu Mazen , recognizes this , but the question is whether he can deliver . 
The Palestinian leadership could also start down the difficult road of telling the refugees that - contrary to almost 50 years of Palestinian propaganda - they will not return to Israel , but will have to be settled in the West Bank and Gaza , the areas that will become part of the eventual Palestinian state . 
In an ideal world , conflicts end by agreements and treaties . 
But in the real world - and Cyprus , Bosnia , and Kosovo may be examples - stabilization and the slow de-escalation of violence can sometimes achieve the same end , even without formal agreement . 
In the absence of plausible alternatives , one hopes that this will also be the case for Israelis and Palestinians .
