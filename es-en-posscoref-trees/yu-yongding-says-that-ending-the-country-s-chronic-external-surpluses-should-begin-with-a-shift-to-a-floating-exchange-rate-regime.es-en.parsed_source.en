Reviving China &apos;s Rebalancing 
BEIJING - China is at a crossroads . 
After experiencing three decades of unprecedentedly rapid GDP growth , the country weathered the global economic crisis exceptionally well . 
But it sustains considerable economic imbalances , which are undermining its ability to achieve high-income status . 
The question is whether China &apos;s leaders - preoccupied with challenges like financial instability stemming from risky shadow-banking activities and a heavy burden of local-government debt - have the policy space to put the economy on a sounder footing . 
In the aftermath of the global economic crisis , China appeared to be on track to complete such a rebalancing . 
Its current-account surplus fell from more than 10 % of GDP in 2007 to 2.6 % in 2012 , and it ran a large capital-account deficit for the first time since 1998 . 
Moreover , China added only $ 98.7 billion to its foreign-exchange reserves in 2012 , compared to an average annual increase of more than $ 435 billion from 2007 to 2011 . 
That meant diminishing upward pressure on the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate . 
But , over the last year , China &apos;s imbalances returned with a vengeance . 
Its 2013 trade surplus likely exceeded $ 250 billion ; its capital-account surplus exceeded $ 200 billion in the first three quarters of the year ; and its foreign-exchange reserves soared by $ 509.7 billion . 
Meanwhile , the lower current-account surplus ( as a share of GDP ) could be a result of its increased investment-income deficit . 
And , while recovery in the advanced economies boosted exports , persistent overcapacity , combined with slower household-consumption growth than in 2012 , caused investment growth , though still rapid , to decline to its lowest rate in the past 11 years . 
In principle , a country can run a current-account deficit or surplus continuously for decades . 
But China &apos;s chronic surpluses are problematic . 
Given that China remains among the world &apos;s poorest countries , with per capita income amounting to less than $ 7,000 , its position as the world &apos;s largest exporter of capital signifies a gross misallocation of resources . 
In fact , after running twin current- and capital-account surpluses persistently for two decades , China &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves are poised to break the $ 4 trillion threshold , with the marginal cost of every dollar accrued vastly surpassing its potential benefits . 
In this context , the continued accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves is clearly counterproductive . 
Of course , rebalancing China &apos;s economy will take time , and it will entail some risks and sacrifices . 
But China &apos;s leaders must recognize that the country faces massive welfare losses , and thus should be willing to accept slower growth in the short term in exchange for a more stable long-term growth path . 
In fact , with a well-designed policy package , the duration and impact of the growth slowdown could be minimized . 
A critical first step is for the People &apos;s Bank of China to stop intervening in the foreign-exchange market , which would halt the growth of the country &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves . 
In other words , China should adopt a floating exchange-rate regime as soon as possible . 
Although this transition would have a negative impact on China &apos;s economic growth , it would not be nearly as dire as many seem to believe . 
For starters , while it would likely cause the renminbi to strengthen , the consensus in China is that the current exchange rate is not far from the equilibrium level , meaning that the appreciation would likely be moderate . 
Likewise , although renminbi appreciation would diminish export growth , the slowdown would probably not be dramatic , given that China &apos;s export sector is dominated by the processing trade ( specifically , the assembly of intermediate inputs imported from countries like Japan and South Korea ) . 
And the accompanying increase in imports is unlikely to damage China &apos;s economic growth significantly ; it is more likely to complement , rather than substitute for , domestic demand . 
In short , China can afford the costs of rebalancing . 
Given that the liquidity flowing into China over the last several years was increasingly short-term capital aimed at exchange-rate and interest-rate arbitrage ( so-called &quot; hot money &quot; ) , there may be a surge in capital outflows when appreciation expectations have disappeared . 
To prevent large-scale capital flight from threatening China &apos;s financial stability , cross-border flows must be managed carefully . 
A flexible exchange rate dictated by market forces would eliminate the opportunities for currency speculators to make one-way bets on renminbi appreciation , thereby diminishing the stock of hot money that currently accounts for the bulk of China &apos;s capital-account surplus . 
Even if China &apos;s current account remained in surplus for some time , the shift from twin surpluses to a more normal external position would boost the efficiency of resource allocation considerably . 
For too long , China has delayed the necessary adjustment of its balance-of-payments structure . 
It is time to make a change , even if it requires bracing for some risks .
