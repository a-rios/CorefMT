Pakistan &apos;s Next Fight 
NEW YORK - The terrorist sanctuary in the South Waziristan region of Pakistan &apos;s tribal frontier with Afghanistan is coming apart . 
It took a while for the Pakistani Army to move against the region &apos;s rising violence and chaos , but its campaign in South Waziristan is making progress . 
The campaign &apos;s immediate impact consists in Pakistan &apos;s determination to establish its authority in the area . 
The terrorists have shown before that they can take a punch , strike back , and even rebuild their networks . 
Indeed , even as the Pakistani Army launched operation Rah-e-Nijat ( Path to Salvation ) in October , a dozen devastating terrorist attacks in Pakistan &apos;s major cities demonstrated the reach of the South Waziristan militants . 
In a few instances , senior army and intelligence officers were targeted outside their homes in Islamabad , despite extensive security measures in and around the capital . 
The October 11 attack on Army Headquarters in Rawalpindi was the most daring of all - and sent shudders across the military command , because the terrorists knew the layout of the military and security buildings . 
But this inside knowledge also worked against the militants , because it demonstrated what was at stake for the country at large . 
No large street protests against the military operation in South Waziristan have been reported from anywhere in Pakistan . 
But success in South Waziristan is only the starting point for dealing with the problem . 
Militant hubs are scattered throughout the sparsely-populated tribal areas , including the North Waziristan , Orakzai , and Mohmand regions . 
Moreover , violent militancy has now spread into Pakistan proper . 
Southern Punjab is seeing a rapid growth in the number of religious fanatics , and rooting out the problem there is much more challenging than acting in the Pashtun tribal areas . 
Many militants in Punjab worked closely with the Pakistani intelligence services for years , and their infrastructure is dispersed and hidden in various towns and villages . 
The Army , which recruits heavily in the Punjab , will not use force there in the way it is doing in the tribal areas . 
Only a concerted law-enforcement effort , with the full support of the intelligence services , can succeed in the Pakistani heartland . 
The deep security crisis in Pakistan is mirrored across the border in Afghanistan , which offers a model of what not to do . 
The Afghan Taliban , removed from power and routed from the country by the end of 2001 , needed only a few years to revive itself , owing to the failure of the Afghan government and its international backers to rebuild and stabilize the country . 
A critical factor in the Taliban &apos;s revival was the haven that it found in the distant reaches of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border , and the support that it continued to receive from elements within Pakistan . 
This time , as the Afghan Taliban are expelled from Pakistan , NATO and Afghan forces must be ready to take them on . 
Observing the fighting in Pakistan , the United States , Afghanistan , and India expect the Pakistani army to take on both the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistani militants . 
But thousands of fighters are thought to be dispersed in the Pashtun tribal areas of Pakistan , with many of them focused on operations in Afghanistan . 
The cross-border movement of radicals suggests the importance of international cooperation . 
Moreover , alliances among radical groups are constantly shifting , a reflection of tribal traditions and opportunism . 
Outsiders watching these shifts , and the Pakistani government &apos;s handling of them , have been unable to discern a consistent pattern that would explain Pakistani policy . 
But here , regional politics must be taken into account , especially the continuing rivalry between India and Pakistan . 
At every stage of the lengthy conflict that has brought the US into the region , Pakistan has sought to limit Indian influence in Afghanistan . 
Indeed , India &apos;s growing influence and investment in Afghanistan is disturbing to Pakistan &apos;s national security apparatus . 
Ultimately , the dynamics of Afghan politics will determine Afghanistan &apos;s fate . 
For both Pakistan and India , Afghanistan risks turning into a new disputed territory , like Kashmir , where conflict has damaged both countries for more than 60 years . 
In Afghanistan today , they have an opportunity to reject that precedent and act on their mutual interest in stability . 
Pakistan must be able to focus internally on its future . 
Financially insolvent and politically paralyzed , Pakistan needs international help to bring development to its liberated tribal areas and hope to the young people - 65 % of the population - who live there . 
For India , stability in Pakistan and Afghanistan would ease its rise to global economic power . 
Both countries should take advantage of the opportunity for cooperation provided by the Pakistani Army &apos;s campaign against Waziristan &apos;s militants .
