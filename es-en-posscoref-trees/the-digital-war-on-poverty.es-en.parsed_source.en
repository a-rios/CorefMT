The Digital War on Poverty 
NEW YORK - The digital divide is beginning to close . 
The flow of digital information - through mobile phones , text messaging , and the Internet - is now reaching the world &apos;s masses , even in the poorest countries , bringing with it a revolution in economics , politics , and society . 
Extreme poverty is almost synonymous with extreme isolation , especially rural isolation . 
But mobile phones and wireless Internet end isolation , and will therefore prove to be the most transformative technology of economic development of our time . 
The digital divide is ending not through a burst of civic responsibility , but mainly through market forces . 
Mobile phone technology is so powerful , and costs so little per unit of data transmission , that it has proved possible to sell mobile phone access to the poor . 
There are now more than 3.3 billion subscribers in the world , roughly one for every two people on the planet . 
Moreover , market penetration in poor countries is rising sharply . 
India has around 300 million subscribers , with subscriptions rising by a stunning eight million or more per month . 
Brazil now has more than 130 million subscribers , and Indonesia has roughly 120 million . 
In Africa , which contains the world &apos;s poorest countries , the market is soaring , with more than 280 million subscribers . 
Mobile phones are now ubiquitous in villages as well as cities . 
If an individual does not have a cell phone , they almost surely know someone who does . 
Probably a significant majority of Africans have at least emergency access to a cell phone , either their own , a neighbor &apos;s , or one at a commercial kiosk . 
Even more remarkable is the continuing &quot; convergence &quot; of digital information : wireless systems increasingly link mobile phones with the Internet , personal computers , and information services of all kinds . 
The array of benefits is stunning . 
The rural poor in more and more of the world now have access to wireless banking and payments systems , such as Kenya &apos;s famous M-PESA system , which allows money transfers through the phone . 
The information carried on the new networks spans public health , medical care , education , banking , commerce , and entertainment , in addition to communications among family and friends . 
India , home to world-leading software engineers , high-tech companies , and a vast and densely populated rural economy of some 700 million poor people in need of connectivity of all kinds , has naturally been a pioneer of digital-led economic development . 
Government and business have increasingly teamed up in public-private partnerships to provide crucial services on the digital network . 
In the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat , for example , emergency ambulance services are now within reach of tens of millions of people , supported by cell phones , sophisticated computer systems , and increased public investments in rural health . 
Several large-scale telemedicine systems are now providing primary health and even cardiac care to rural populations . 
Moreover , India &apos;s new rural employment guarantee scheme , just two years old , is not only employing millions of the poorest through public financing , but also is bringing tens of millions of them into the formal banking system , building on India &apos;s digital networks . 
On the fully commercial side , the mobile revolution is creating a logistics revolution in farm-to-retail marketing . 
Farmers and food retailers can connect directly through mobile phones and distribution hubs , enabling farmers to sell their crops at higher &quot; farm-gate &quot; prices and without delay , while buyers can move those crops to markets with minimum spoilage and lower prices for final consumers . 
The strengthening of the value chain not only raises farmers &quot; incomes , but also empowers crop diversification and farm upgrading more generally . 
Similarly , world-leading software firms are bringing information technology jobs , including business process outsourcing , right into the villages through digital networks . 
Education will be similarly transformed . 
Throughout the world , schools at all levels will go global , joining together in worldwide digital education networks . 
Children in the United States will learn about Africa , China , and India not only from books and videos , but also through direct links across classrooms in different parts of the world . 
Students will share ideas through live chats , shared curricula , joint projects , and videos , photos , and text sent over the digital network . 
Universities , too , will have global classes , with students joining lectures , discussion groups , and research teams from a dozen or more universities at a time . 
This past year , my own university - Columbia University in New York City - teamed up with universities in Ecuador , Nigeria , the United Kingdom , France , Ethiopia , Malaysia , India , Canada , Singapore , and China in a &quot; Global Classroom &quot; that simultaneously connected hundreds of students on more than a dozen campuses in an exciting course on global sustainable development . 
In my book The End of Poverty , I wrote that extreme poverty can be ended by the year 2025 . 
A rash predication , perhaps , given global violence , climate change , and threats to food , energy , and water supplies . 
But digital information technologies , if deployed cooperatively and globally , will be our most important new tools , because they will enable us to join together globally in markets , social networks , and cooperative efforts to solve our common problems .
