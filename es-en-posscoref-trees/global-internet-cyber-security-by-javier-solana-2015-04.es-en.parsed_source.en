Cyber War and Peace 
MADRID - Information and communication technologies have become a central part of everyday life for most of the world &apos;s population . 
They affect even the most underdeveloped and remote areas of the planet and have become a key factor driving development , innovation , and economic growth . 
But this is just the beginning of a fundamental transformation . 
In the coming years , new technologies , such as the &quot; Internet of things , &quot; 3-D printing , and autonomous vehicles will revolutionize businesses operations , regulatory regimes , and even social conventions . 
These technologies generate enormous benefits , but they are also risky , owing to the ease of accessing data and using it for criminal purposes . 
Cyber attacks are already vastly increasing in number , sophistication , magnitude , and impact . 
As the world becomes more interdependent and hyper-connected , there is growing concern about the vulnerability of the Internet , an infrastructure on which nearly all economic activities - including trade , energy provision , and the entire financial system - have come to depend . 
Cyber attacks take place in a medium , cyberspace , where offensive actions have an advantage over defensive ones . 
Indeed , most of cyberspace &apos;s infrastructure was designed to ensure its interoperability and openness , often at the expense of security , which tends to limit usability . 
Attacks are usually asymmetric ; the barriers to cyberspace are inconsequential and governments have struggled to enforce the rule of law online . 
Attackers with limited resources are able to cause disruptions that have far greater impact than similar actions in the physical world . 
Indeed , the damage from a cyber attack is by nature transnational , capable of rapidly cascading to a global level . 
In a medium that does not map onto political borders , it is impossible to manage risks successfully from just one jurisdiction . 
In economic terms , cyber crime is already comparable in size to drug trafficking , and it is highly internationalized . 
But we have yet to develop fully a global governance regime . 
Various initiatives have attempted to facilitate the international management of cyberspace , but none has had more than limited success . 
The Global Conference on Cyberspace ( GCCS ) , recently hosted by the Netherlands , is an example of this . 
Representatives from governments , the private sector , civil society , and the technical community met in The Hague to foster a multi-stakeholder approach to cyberspace governance and public-private cooperation . 
The approach embodied by the GCCS combines a traditional regime - in which sovereign states are the main players - with another , more modern approach , in which all of the agents concerned participate . 
This more open , multi-stakeholder model mirrors the traditional technical management of the Internet , which has proven to be very effective in maintaining the resilience of cyberspace . 
It is based on bottom-up consensus , fosters a collective sense of management , and stresses the promotion of trust and international cooperation . 
The effectiveness of approaches like this one is limited by the fact that the three largest cyberspace powers - the United States , China , and Russia - have not agreed on a common treaty to harmonize national laws or facilitate cooperation . 
Nor do they cooperate on the issue through other institutions , with the exception of the G-20 and the United Nations . 
Recent cases of cyber espionage have generated growing mistrust even among traditional allies like the EU and the US . 
In the interest of defending their sovereignty , states could begin to interfere in the technical governance that has proved so efficient . 
Indeed , the danger of international conflict has worsened in the past few months , eroding whatever trust existed between the powers . 
Cyberspace risks becoming a battleground , on which governments , non-state actors , and the private sector all clash . 
The recent attack by jihadis on France &apos;s channel TV5 and the alleged hack of Sony by North Korea may be forerunners of what is to come . 
Companies and civil society alike have roles to play in ensuring that the governance of cyberspace remains open , inclusive , and sufficiently flexible to adapt itself to changing risks and challenges . 
The existing approach to technical management must be preserved , even as other innovative proposals are explored . 
Ideas that could contribute to better governance include a G-20 ( states ) + 20 ( relevant non-governmental players ) Cyber Stability Board and an early warning and coordination system based on the World Health Organization &apos;s approach to epidemics . 
Responding to twenty-first-century threats with twentieth-century tools is a bad idea . 
By 2020 , two-thirds of the global population will be online . 
The world needs a fluid and frank dialogue among states , the private sector , and civil society in order to guarantee the security of cyberspace . 
The international community has put in place minimal codes that regulate areas like health and nuclear weapons proliferation . 
There is no reason why we cannot do the same in cyberspace . 
We all have a common interest in preserving its openness and global character ; doing so will require that we set aside narrow national interests in the interest of guaranteeing collective progress .
