Cory Aquino &apos;s Legacy 
MANILA - The death of President Corazon Cojuangco Aquino - &quot; Tita Cory &quot; to most of the 92 million people of the Philippines - left behind a precious inheritance : a legacy of freedom that the Philippines came to share with oppressed peoples around the world . For her revolution was the first of the wave of &quot; velvet revolutions &quot; that liberated countless millions from Manila to Seoul to Johannesburg to Prague , Warsaw and Moscow . President Aquino &apos;s &quot; People Power &quot; revolution , indeed , is among the proudest moments in my country &apos;s history , and the distinctive contribution of our people to the saga of mankind &apos;s long struggle for freedom and dignity . 
Cory Aquino motivated ordinary Filipinos to peaks of daring and selflessness at a time when their spirit had almost been broken by a 14-year dictatorship . While her husband Ninoy Aquino lived , she - as the unassuming but caring housewife - was the stabilizing influence that tempered his dynamic personality . But after the assassination of Senator Ninoy Aquino in August 1983 , she stepped resolutely into his role as political leader of my country &apos;s democratic opposition to an entrenched despotic regime . 
Devoid of histrionics , without pretension - &quot; simply by telling people what the dictator has done to this country &quot; - she touched the hearts of freedom-loving Filipinos everywhere , the pain of the traumatic murder by the regime of her husband evoking in them memories of their own suffering and thwarted hopes . 
It was in her name that concerned Filipinos mobilized families and neighbors to confront the tanks , guns and barbed wire of the dictator &apos;s cohorts . And , in God &apos;s infinite wisdom , the militancy of common people burst forth in the non-violent revolution that overthrew Ferdinand Marcos . 
We the soldiers and policemen who backed her were reinforced by Cory &apos;s steel core of values and principles . 
In crisis after crisis during her presidency , she exemplified unwavering firmness in the democratic exercise of power as a servant-leader . 
Cory provided policy guidance as Commander-in-Chief , but trusted the Defense Department and Armed Forces to carry out their missions in the face of 9 coup attempts which were all frustrated . These mutinies were all death-dealing situations that threatened national stability , and yet she never flinched . 
Prayer and spiritual devotion were important components of Cory &apos;s daily endeavors - and a major influence in her decision-making and personal relations . Her inner reserves of faith , indeed , kept her going through every hardship . 
Her spiritual strength arose out of her deep and abiding reliance on the grace and boundless mercy of the god she believed in . 
In the tumult of the post-revolutionary period , she presided with surprising even-handedness over the unavoidable rivalries among different sides of the political spectrum . More importantly , Cory sparked the momentum for the Philippines to regain a position of respect , dignity and even admiration in the community of nations . 
So Cory Aquino &apos;s death has , in many ways , orphaned the Filipino nation . We who are left behind owe her the duty of safeguarding her legacy of freedom - and of enriching it with social justice and unity in nation-building . For until the very end of her battle with cancer , she continued to speak out for individual transformation and , on the part of those elected to lead us , for their selfless stewardship . 
The finest tribute Filipinos and other freedom-loving peoples can offer to Cory &apos;s memory is for responsible citizens to work towards the vision of an empowered , bountiful future for which she and Ninoy aspired . Irrevocably , their names will forever be intimately intertwined with the peaceful revolution of 1986 which restored our liberty and democracy . 
But the liberation she brought to us was just one battle in the generational struggle the people of the Philippines must wage to secure their liberation from poverty , inequity and injustice . 
Success in that war is not pre-ordained , but can only be won through willing sacrifice , faithfulness to duty , and concerted action for our people &apos;s well-being . 
These are the internal wars every nation and society , no matter how big or small , must win . Cory Aquino &apos;s lifetime of service and sacrifice provided the tools and a model for how to win that seemingly eternal struggle . To sustain such a treasured legacy and defend democracy wherever it is threatened is our collective responsibility .
