Meeting America &apos;s Growth Challenge 
BERKELEY - The United States continues to recover from its deepest economic slump since the Great Depression , but the pace of recovery remains frustratingly slow . 
There are several reasons to anticipate modest improvement in 2013 , although , as usual , there are downside risks . 
Prolonged recession or a financial crisis in Europe and slower growth in emerging markets are the main external sources of potential danger . 
At home , political infighting underlies the two greatest risks : failure to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling and an additional round of fiscal contraction that stymies economic growth . 
Since 2010 , tepid average annual GDP growth of 2.1 % has meant weak job creation . 
In both this recovery and the previous two , the rebound in employment growth has been weaker and later than the rebound in GDP growth . 
But the loss of jobs in the most recent recession was more than twice as large as in previous recessions , so a slow recovery has meant a much higher unemployment rate for a much longer period . 
Weak aggregate demand is the primary culprit for subdued GDP and employment growth . 
The 2008 recession was triggered by a financial crisis that erupted after the collapse of a credit-fueled asset bubble decimated the housing market . 
Private-sector demand contracts sharply and recovers only slowly after such crises . 
The private-sector financial balance swung from a deficit of 3.7 % of GDP in 2006 , at the height of the boom , to a surplus of about 6.8 % of GDP in 2010 and about 5 % today . 
This represents the sharpest contraction and weakest recovery in private-sector demand since the end of World War II . 
Growth in two components of private demand , residential investment and consumption , which account for more than 75 % of total spending in the US economy , has been especially slow . 
Both sources of demand are likely to strengthen in 2013 . 
Residential investment is still at an historic low as a share of GDP as a result of overbuilding during the 2003-2008 housing boom and the tsunami of foreclosures that followed . 
But the headwinds in the housing market are dissipating . 
Home sales , prices , and construction all rose last year , while foreclosures declined . 
Residential investment should be a source of output and job growth this year . 
Large losses in household wealth , deleveraging from unsustainable debt , weak wage growth , and a decline in labor &apos;s share of national income to a historic low have combined to constrain consumption growth . 
Real median household income is still nearly 7 % below its 2007 peak , real median household net worth dropped by 35 % between 2005 and 2010 ( and remains significantly below its pre-recession peak ) , and about 90 % of the income gains during the recovery have gone to the top 1 % . 
To be sure , the balance-sheet headwinds holding back consumption have eased . 
Households have slashed their debt - often through painful foreclosures and bankruptcies - and their debt relative to income has sunk to its 2005 level , significantly below its 2008 peak . Helped by low interest rates , debt service relative to household income has fallen back to levels not seen since the early 1980 &quot; s . 
But consumption will be hit by the expiration of the payroll tax cut , which will reduce household income by about $ 125 billion this year . 
Another factor holding back recovery has been weak growth in spending on goods and services by both state and local governments , and more recently by the federal government . 
Indeed , since the recession &apos;s onset , state and local governments have cut nearly 600,000 jobs and reduced spending for infrastructure projects by 20 % . 
The fiscal trends for 2013 are mixed , but negative overall . 
While state and local government cutbacks in spending and employment are ending as the recovery boosts their tax revenues , the fiscal drag at the federal level is strengthening . 
The American Taxpayer Relief Act - the tax deal reached in early January to avoid the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; - shaves about $ 750 billion from the deficit over the next ten years and could take a percentage point off the 2013 growth rate . 
In addition , although less widely appreciated , significant reductions in federal spending are already under way , with more likely to come . 
Spending cuts and revenue increases that have been legislated since 2011 will reduce the projected deficit by $ 2.4 trillion over the next decade , with three-quarters coming from spending cuts , almost exclusively in non-defense discretionary programs . 
Based on current economic assumptions , the US needs about $ 4 trillion in savings to stabilize the debt / GDP ratio over the next decade . 
It is already three-fifths of the way there . 
The so-called sequester ( the across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to begin in March ) , would slash another $ 100 billion this year and $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade . 
Although it could stabilize the debt / GDP ratio , the sequester would be a mistake : it fails to distinguish among spending priorities , would undermine essential programs , and would mean another significant dent in growth this year . 
Moreover , despite the warnings of deficit alarmists , the US does not face an imminent debt crisis . 
Currently , the federal debt held by the public is just over 70 % of GDP , a level not seen since the early 1950 &quot; s . 
However , government debt soars by an average of 86 % after severe financial crises , so the increase in the federal debt by 70 % between 2008 and 2012 is not surprising . 
Nor is it alarming . 
The US economy grew rapidly for several years after WWII with a higher debt / GDP ratio , and today &apos;s ratio is lower than in all other major industrial countries ( and roughly half that of Greece , analogies to which are absurd and misleading ) . 
During the last two years , Washington has been obsessed with the need to cut the deficit and put the debt / GDP ratio on a &quot; sustainable &quot; path , even as global investors have flocked to US government debt , driving interest rates to historic lows . 
Also overlooked have been the immediate challenges of low growth , weak investment , and high unemployment . 
It is time to refocus . 
The US needs a plan for faster growth , not more deficit reduction . 
Evsey Domar , a legendary growth economist ( and one of my MIT professors ) counseled that the problem of alleviating the debt burden is essentially a problem of achieving growth in national income . 
We should heed his wisdom .
