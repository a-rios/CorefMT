Training for Stability 
The Balkan wars of the 1990 &apos;s ravaged not only millions of people , but also the social institutions that gave shape to their lives . 
Indeed , the changes brought about by Yugoslavia &apos;s dissolution and the wars of succession that followed annihilated large parts of the traditional education and training systems of Serbia , Croatia , Bosnia , Macedonia , and Kosovo . 
Since then , stability and hope have begun to return to a region affected by the destruction of war and the widespread despair of social displacement . 
The Balkan Stability Pact of 1999 and massive international support have helped rebuild local education , while developing innovative vocational education and training systems that should boost long-term employment . 
The results of many projects in these countries are encouraging , with the current focus on training key groups , such as entrepreneurs , teachers , and young and unemployed people . 
The same model can and should be followed elsewhere in the troubled lands that border the European Union . 
In a time of political and economic transition - for example , the shift from authoritarianism to democracy and from a centrally planned to a free market economy - many jobs are on the line . 
The redundancies that result are not only a waste of human resources , but also a source of stress for the people involved ; both in economic and social terms , mass redundancies can be tragic and can lead to dangerous instability . 
Vocational training can soften these blows . 
Indeed , universal access to primary education and vocational training programs are at the heart of any strategy to eliminate poverty and ensure stability . 
Developing skills and qualifications is all the more vital to establishing a more peaceful and prosperous future in areas already riven by conflict . 
Compared to other forms of education , targeted professional training can offer swift results when economies are undergoing transition . 
For individuals , it can help turn the threat of redundancy into the challenge of venturing in new directions . 
For society as a whole , it can swing the balance from recession to growth . 
But not only political and economic transitions are wrenching . 
Demographic changes can be equally painful for a society . 
In the Mediterranean countries of North Africa , the young active population is expanding fast . 
Since 1990 , this region &apos;s population has grown by 24 % , to 167.2 million . 
Yet one in every three young people is unemployed . 
This joblessness naturally makes the EU a magnet for migrant labor . 
To stem this trend , the emerging economies of North Africa , as well as those of Eastern Europe , need to develop homegrown human capital by raising their populations &apos; skill levels . 
This strategy alone can enable these countries to compete economically in an increasingly global market . 
Vocational education and training development can make a powerful contribution towards achieving this goal . 
It can offer radical change in the lives of millions of people by helping them find work and thus providing hope of a better life for their families and children . 
It can also bring about crucial changes on a larger scale - helping to reduce illiteracy and crime , for example , as well as other social pathologies that impede prosperity and stability . 
Equally important , professional training development in the Middle East , North Africa , and Eastern Europe can bring about improved international relations and trade , together with reduced migration pressure . 
Unfortunately , in many countries vocational education and training suffers from low status , particularly compared to higher education . 
The need to convince both policymakers and citizens of the benefits of vocational education and training is therefore pressing . 
But education has always been hard to promote as a subject of foreign assistance . 
Education is a field where short-term results are difficult to achieve and the sheer size of even the smallest individual country &apos;s education system makes effective external support daunting . 
Regardless of how much money is spent , it never can fund comprehensive reform of any country &apos;s education and training system . 
Moreover , education is often viewed as an issue of national sovereignty . 
This is not to say that educational development is a field where foreign assistance is inappropriate . 
But because there are limits to what foreign assistance can achieve , it needs to be planned carefully . 
Rather than fund comprehensive education reform , international partners can supply the tools with which individual countries can bring about reform themselves . 
However such assistance is delivered , one thing is certain : universal access to primary education and vocational training programs is at the heart of any strategy to eliminate poverty and to ensure stability . 
Public and private resources must be mobilized to build , enhance , and maintain solid educational infrastructures . 
Developing skills and qualifications represents a powerful step towards a more peaceful and prosperous future in areas of conflict and poverty , but the interest in helping countries take that step is universal .
