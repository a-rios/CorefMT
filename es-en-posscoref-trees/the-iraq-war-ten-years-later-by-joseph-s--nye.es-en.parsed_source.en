The Iraq War Ten Years Later 
CAMBRIDGE - This month marks the tenth anniversary of the controversial American-led invasion of Iraq . 
What has that decision wrought over the last decade ? 
More important , was the decision to invade rightly made ? 
On the positive side , analysts point to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein , the creation of an elected government , and an economy growing at nearly 9 % per year , with oil exports surpassing their pre-war level . 
Some , such as Nadim Shehadi of Chatham House , go further , arguing that , while &quot; the US certainly bit off more than it could chew in Iraq , &quot; America &apos;s intervention &quot; may have shaken the region out of &#91; a &#93; stagnation that has dominated the lives of at least two generations . &quot; 
Skeptics reply that it would be wrong to link the Iraq War to the &quot; Arab Spring , &quot; because events in Tunisia and Egypt in 2011 had their own origins , while President George W. Bush &apos;s actions and rhetoric discredited , rather than advanced , the cause of democracy in the region . 
Removing Saddam was important , but Iraq is now a violent place governed by a sectarian group , with one corruption index ranking it 169th out of 174 countries . 
Whatever the benefits of the war , skeptics argue , they are too meager to justify the costs : more than 150,000 Iraqis and 4,488 American service members killed , and an estimated cost of nearly $ 1 trillion ( not including long-term health and disability costs for some 32,000 wounded US soldiers . ) 
Perhaps this balance sheet will look different a decade from now , but at this point most Americans have concluded that the skeptics are right , and that thinking has influenced current US foreign policy . 
In the next decade , it is very unlikely that the US will try another prolonged occupation and transformation of another country . 
Some call this isolationism , but it might better be called prudence or pragmatism . 
After all , President Dwight D. Eisenhower refused in 1954 to send US troops to save the French at Dien Bien Phu because he feared that they would be &quot; swallowed up by the divisions &quot; in Vietnam . 
And Ike was hardly an isolationist . 
Bush and his officials used three main arguments to justify invading Iraq . 
The first tied Saddam to Al Qaeda . 
Public-opinion polls show that many Americans accepted the administration &apos;s word on the connection , but the evidence has not sustained it . 
Indeed , the evidence that was presented publicly was thin and exaggerated . 
The second argument was that replacing Saddam with a democratic regime was a way to transform Middle East politics . 
A number of neoconservative members of the administration had urged regime change in Iraq well before taking office , but were unable to turn it into policy during the first eight months of the administration . 
After September 11 , 2001 , they quickly moved their policy through the window of opportunity that the terrorist attacks had opened . 
Bush spoke often of regime change and a &quot; freedom agenda , &quot; with supporters citing the role of American military occupation in the democratization of Germany and Japan after World War II . 
The third argument focused on preventing Saddam from possessing weapons of mass destruction . 
Most countries agreed that Saddam had defied United Nations Security Council resolutions for a dozen years . 
Moreover , Resolution 1441 unanimously put the burden of proof on Saddam . 
While Bush was later faulted when inspectors failed to find WMDs , the view that Saddam possessed them was widely shared by other countries . 
Prudence might have bought more time for the inspectors , but Bush was not alone in this mistake . 
Bush has said that history will redeem him , and compares himself to President Harry S. Truman , who left office with low poll ratings because of the Korean War , yet is well regarded today . 
Will history really be so kind to Bush ? 
Truman biographer David McCullough warns that about 50 years must pass before historians can really appraise a presidency . 
Bush lacks comparable successes to compensate for his mismanagement of Iraq . 
History tends to be unkind to the unlucky , but historians also judge leaders in terms of the causes of their luck . 
Good coaches analyze their game and their opponent &apos;s game , so that they can capitalize on errors and benefit from &quot; good luck . &quot; 
By contrast , reckless reality-testing and unnecessary risk-taking are often part of &quot; bad luck . &quot; 
Future historians are likely to fault Bush for these shortcomings . 
Even if fortuitous events lead to a better Middle East in another ten years , future historians will criticize the way Bush made his decisions and distributed the risks and costs of his actions . 
It is one thing to guide people up a mountain ; it is another to lead them to the edge of a cliff .
