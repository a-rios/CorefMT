Palestine &apos;s Moment of Decision 
NOT TO BE PUBLISHED BEFORE JANUARY 10 
The victory of Mahmoud Abbas in the Palestinian presidential election poses a huge challenge to the Palestinian leadership . 
By being voted chairman of the PLO &apos;s executive committee hours after the death of Yasser Arafat , Abbas clinched the support of the organization that represents all Palestinians , including those in the diaspora . 
Popular election as President of the Palestinian National Authority gives Abbas the grassroots legitimacy to carry out his political program . 
That program , while similar to Arafat &apos;s , differs in key ways . 
Abbas ( also known as Abu Mazen ) has been publicly and consistently critical of what he calls the &quot; militarization of the intifada . &quot; 
Even before Arafat &apos;s death , Abbas argued that the use of force by militants weakens the Palestinian negotiating position . 
He stuck to this position throughout his electoral campaign , refusing the demands of hard-line Palestinian factions that he apologize for his previous statements . 
Abbas conducts himself in a business-like manner , and he strongly believes in the rule of law and in the need for real civilian governance to assume preeminence in Palestinian politics . 
In this he also differs from Arafat , who believed that the revolutionary mindset must continue so as long as Palestinians lived under an illegal foreign occupation . 
Until liberation , there could be no business as usual . 
By winning election on a clear anti-violence and pro-rule of law platform , Abbas has the mandate and the responsibility to carry out this policy . 
He needs to make it clear to every armed Palestinian that there will be no tolerance for any unofficial group carrying arms or conducting military attacks from Palestinian territory . 
In order to preserve national unity , Abbas will obviously need to use all his persuasive skills to convince radical groups ( some in his own Fatah movement ) to respect that approach . 
As chairman of the PLO , he will be under extreme pressure not to delegitimize the internationally sanctioned acts of resistance against Israeli military targets . 
In order to counter that pressure , he will have to show that a cessation of violence is in the higher interest of Palestinians . 
Abbas will find it equally challenging to apply rule-of-law principles to a traumatized community that is reeling after nearly five years of violence , oppression , and draconian travel restrictions imposed by the Israelis . 
As in the issue of the militarization of the intifada , this is not a simple matter , as it concerns forces outside the control of Abbas and his government . 
Nevertheless , internal policies will be of grave importance . 
The day-to-day lives - and livelihoods - of Palestinians need immediate improvement . 
The Israeli-built wall to the west of the West Bank means that Palestinian unemployment will continue to rise and living standards will continue to drop . 
To counter this , Abbas will have to seek external Arab and international support . 
The real need is to encourage investment , primarily from Palestinians and Arabs . 
But this is unlikely without major legal and administrative reforms , and , more generally , good governance and ironclad application of the rule of law . 
The key to establishing civil order is peace . 
No matter how persuasive Abbas is in convincing radical groups to put down their arms , a unilateral ceasefire will not last long if it is not mutual . 
The role of the Israeli occupation forces will thus be crucial in determining the success of Abbas &apos;s daunting mission . 
Indeed , the task that Abbas faces will become impossible if the Israeli policy of &quot; targeted killings &quot; is allowed to continue while Palestinian leaders are working seriously to put an end to acts of violence against Israelis . 
Ultimately , the main agenda for the new Palestinian president in negotiations with Israel will be to push the Israelis to make good on their repeated international assurances that a viable contiguous Palestinian state is a realistic goal in the near future . 
But if left to Israelis and Palestinians alone , the goal of Palestinian independence within the 1967 borders of Palestine will most likely remain out of reach . 
The international community , lead by the United States , must invest effort and political capital to realize this goal . 
The new Palestinian president faces a challenging agenda and high popular expectations . 
Much will depend on how Abbas handles himself and how he governs . 
But the ultimate question is what Israel and the international community will do if Abbas fulfills his pledge to end anti-Israeli violence and apply the rule of law in a functioning democracy . 
Palestinians have chosen ; now the world must do so as well .
