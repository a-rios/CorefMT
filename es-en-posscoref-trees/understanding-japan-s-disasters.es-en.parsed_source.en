Understanding Japan &apos;s Disasters 
NEWPORT BEACH - As we all struggle to comprehend the economic and financial impact of Japan &apos;s calamity , it is tempting to seek historical analogies for guidance . 
Indeed , many have been quick to cite the aftermath of the terrible 1995 Kobe earthquake . 
First , let us consider the similarities between Japan &apos;s current tragedy and that of 1995 . 
Both involved terrible earthquakes that resulted in tremendous human suffering and large-scale physical damage . 
Both required the Japanese government to display considerable agility in its rescue efforts . 
Both triggered multiple offers of help from friends and allies around the world . 
In both cases , wealth destruction was accompanied by disruptions to daily economic life . 
There are also important forward-looking similarities . 
As with the aftermath of Kobe , the current focus on rescuing survivors will be followed by a huge reconstruction program . 
Massive budgetary allocations will be made ( 2 % of GDP in the case of Kobe ) . 
Affected households will receive financial assistance to help them restore some normalcy to their lives . 
Roads , housing , and much other infrastructure will be repaired and upgraded . 
These similarities have led several economists to provide early predictions of the national and global economic consequences , including a sharp V-like recovery in Japan &apos;s growth rate in 2011 , as the initial downturn is followed by a surge in economic activity , implying a rapid recovery in Japan &apos;s tax base and level of GDP . 
Such predictions counsel caution against over-reaction by policymakers outside Japan . 
Rather than immediately incorporating Japanese developments into their thinking , policymakers should treat the effects on the global economy as &quot; transitory &quot; - that is , temporary and reversible - and thus &quot; look through &quot; them in designing their responses . 
But there is a risk that this approach could understate the Japanese disaster &apos;s domestic and international consequences . 
As such , it could contribute to insufficient responses in Japan itself - from the government to individual companies and households - as well as in other countries . 
Indeed , such a mal-diagnosis could delay what I believe will be an eventual solid recovery in Japan . 
Five factors suggest that Japan faces a uniquely difficult and uncertain set of challenges . 
First , the economic damage from Japan &apos;s three calamities ( a horrifying earthquake , a devastating tsunami , and a nuclear crisis ) may well be double that of Kobe . 
Second , Japan &apos;s public finances are weaker than in 1995 , and demographic factors are less favorable . 
Domestic public debt today stands at roughly 205 % of GDP , compared to around 85 % in 1995 . 
The country &apos;s sovereign rating is AA- , not AAA , as it was 16 years ago . 
Third , benchmark interest rates are already near zero , and have been for a while . 
Fourth , the addition of destabilizing nuclear uncertainty to the terrible impact of the natural disasters amplifies the reconstruction challenges . 
Given the damage and dangers , it will take time for Japan to restore fully its power-generation capabilities , affecting the potential GDP growth rate . 
Food safety is also a concern , as is the economic impact of nuclear uncertainties on the Japanese psyche . 
Finally , Japan &apos;s external environment today is more challenging . 
During the post-Kobe reconstruction period , world demand was buoyant and global productivity surged , owing to China &apos;s gathering boom , America &apos;s information-technology and communications revolution , and political and economic convergence in Europe . 
Today , aggregate demand in advanced economies is still recovering from the global financial crisis , while systemically important emerging economies like Brazil and China are tapping their policy brakes in order to counter economic overheating . 
Meanwhile , on the supply side , countries are dealing with high and volatile commodity prices , including an oil-price spike as a result of the Middle East uprisings . 
If this analysis proves correct , it implies that Japan &apos;s reconstruction challenge will be more difficult than after the Kobe earthquake . 
Negative wealth and income effects this time around will be more severe , and the recovery process will probably take longer and be more complex . 
At the national level , this calls urgently for a degree of unity and decisiveness that has been absent from Japanese politics for years . 
Without it , the authorities will find it difficult to communicate and implement a medium-term economic vision that puts rapid sustained growth , and not just reconstruction , at the core of the policy response . 
Japan &apos;s disasters will add to the global economy &apos;s headwinds - be they the impact of the initial fall in consumption in the world &apos;s third-largest economy , or disruptions to global supply chains ( particularly in technology and autos ) . 
And Japan &apos;s nuclear crisis will mean greater uncertainty about nuclear power in other countries . 
There is also a financial angle , the importance of which depends on the mix of new government borrowing , debt monetization , and repatriation of Japanese savings that is used to fund Japan &apos;s reconstruction program . 
The greater the repatriation component , the larger the negative impact on some financial markets . 
So , as tempting as they may be , analytical shortcuts are best avoided at this early stage . 
It will take time and thorough analysis to specify the true consequences of Japan &apos;s triple calamity , including the longer-term impact on its economy and that of the rest of the world . 
The Japanese have shown admirable courage in the face of unthinkable tragedy . 
I have no doubt that a successful reconstruction program will lead their country to recovery . 
In the meantime , however , the urgency of restoring a sense of normalcy and hope to a dramatically wounded society warrants thoughtful and deep analyses .
