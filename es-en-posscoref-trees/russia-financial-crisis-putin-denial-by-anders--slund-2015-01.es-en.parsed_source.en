Putin in Denial 
WASHINGTON , DC - As 2014 came to a close , an enormous financial crisis erupted in Russia . 
World oil prices had fallen by almost half since mid-June , and the ruble plummeted in December , finishing the year down by a similar margin . 
Russia &apos;s international reserves have fallen by $ 135 billion , and inflation has reached double digits . 
Things are only going to get worse . 
The current oil price will force Russia to cut its imports by half - a move that , together with the continuing rise in inflation , will diminish Russians &quot; living standards considerably . 
Russia &apos;s ability to negotiate its current predicament hinges on its powerful president , Vladimir Putin . 
But Putin remains unprepared to act ; in fact , so far , he has pretended that there is no crisis at all . 
In both of his major public appearances in December , Putin referred simply to the &quot; current situation . &quot; 
In his New Year greeting , he boasted about the annexation of Crimea and the successful Winter Olympics in Sochi , carefully avoiding any reference to the economy . 
But , with the economy in free fall , Putin cannot pretend forever . 
And when he finally does acknowledge reality , he will have little room for maneuver . 
But this would amount to admitting defeat - something that Putin is not prone to do . 
Moreover , even before the oil-price collapse , crony capitalism had brought growth to a halt - and any serious effort to change the system would destabilize his power base . 
In fact , Putin &apos;s leadership approach seems fundamentally incompatible with any solution to Russia &apos;s current economic woes . 
Though accurate and timely statistics on Russia &apos;s economy - needed to guide effective measures to counter the crisis - are readily available to the public online , Putin claims not to use the Internet . 
Instead , the journalist Ben Judah reports , Putin receives daily updates on Kremlin politics , domestic affairs , and foreign relations from his three key intelligence agencies . 
His actions suggest that he considers economic data to be far less important than security information - perhaps the natural attitude of a kleptocrat . 
To be clear , there is no dearth of economic expertise among Russian policymakers . 
On the contrary , Russia &apos;s key economic institutions boast competent managers . 
The problem is that policymaking is concentrated in the Kremlin , where economic expertise is lacking . 
Indeed , the last of the economic heavyweights - all of them holdovers from the 1990s - in Putin &apos;s personal circle was Alexei Kudrin , who resigned as Finance Minister in 2011 . 
Unlike in the US , none of Russia &apos;s top economic managers sits on the National Security Council . 
Putin has usurped authority not just from his more knowledgeable colleagues , but also from the prime minister , who has traditionally served as Russia &apos;s chief economic policymaker . 
Indeed , since Putin returned to the presidency in 2012 , Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev has been all but irrelevant . 
In short , Putin - who is no economic expert - makes all major economic policy decisions in Russia , delivering orders to top managers of state-owned enterprises and individual ministers in ad hoc , one-on-one meetings . 
As a result , Russian economic policymaking is fragmented and dysfunctional . 
Nowhere is this lack of coordination more obvious than in the sensitive currency market . 
In Russia , unlike in most other countries , the central bank does not retain the exclusive right to intervene . 
When the ruble tumbled in December , the finance ministry - which holds almost half of Russia &apos;s foreign reserves , $ 169 billion , in two sovereign-wealth funds - deemed the central bank &apos;s intervention to be insufficient . 
So it announced that it would sell $ 7 billion from its reserves to boost the ruble - a move that caused the exchange rate to overshoot on the upside . 
When the exchange rate plummeted again , the Kremlin urged the five largest state-owned exporting companies to exchange a portion of their assets into rubles , leading to another overshoot , followed by yet another sharp decline . 
Clearly , such uncoordinated interventions are exacerbating currency-market turmoil , with the ruble &apos;s value fluctuating by 5 % - and as much as 10 % - in a single day . 
Russia &apos;s fiscal situation , determined by Putin &apos;s arbitrary budget management , is hardly better . 
Putin &apos;s priorities are clear : first come the military , the security apparatus , and the state administration ; second are the major infrastructure projects from which he and his cronies make their fortunes ; social expenditures ( primarily pensions ) , needed to maintain popular support , come last . 
Suddenly , oil revenues are no longer sufficient to cover all three . 
As hard as the finance ministry may try to balance expenditures and revenues , it lacks the needed political weight . 
Last year , the central government delegated more education and health-care expenditures to regional bodies , without allocating more resources - and there was nothing anyone could do about it . 
If Putin wants to save Russia &apos;s economy from disaster , he must shift his priorities . 
For starters , he must shelve some of the large , long-term infrastructure projects that he has promoted energetically in the last two years . 
Though the decision in December to abandon the South Stream gas pipeline is a step in the right direction , it is far from adequate . 
Likewise , Putin should follow Finance Minister Anton Siluanov &apos;s sensible recommendation to cut public expenditure , including on social programs and the military , by 10 % this year . 
Russia faces serious - and intensifying - financial problems .
