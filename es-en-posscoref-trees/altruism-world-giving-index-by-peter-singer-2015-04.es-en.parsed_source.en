Effective Altruism 
PRINCETON - Can humans really be motivated by altruism ? 
My new book , The Most Good You Can Do , discusses the emerging new movement called Effective Altruism , and , in doing interviews about the book , I am surprised by how often that question is asked . 
Why should we doubt that some people act altruistically , at least some of the time ? 
In evolutionary terms , we can easily understand altruism toward kin and others who can reciprocate our help . 
It seems plausible that once our ability to reason and reflect has developed sufficiently enough to enable us to understand that strangers can suffer and enjoy life just as we can , then at least some of us would act altruistically toward strangers , too . 
The polling organization Gallup asked people in 135 countries whether they had , in the last month , donated money to a charity , volunteered their time to an organization , or helped a stranger . 
Gallup &apos;s results , which form the basis of the World Giving Index 2014 , indicate that approximately 2.3 billion people , a third of the world &apos;s population , perform at least one altruistic act per month . 
More objective evidence of altruism buttresses these findings . 
In many countries , the supply of blood for medical purposes relies on voluntary , anonymous donations . 
Worldwide , more than 11 million people have put their names on donor registries for bone marrow , signifying their willingness to donate their marrow to a stranger . 
A small but growing number of people have gone further still , donating a kidney to a stranger . 
There were 177 altruistic donations by living donors in the United States in 2013 and 118 in the United Kingdom in the year to April 2014 . 
Then there are those who donate to charity . 
In the US alone , individuals gave $ 240 billion to charity in 2013 . 
Foundations and corporations topped this up to a total of $ 335 billion , or about 2 % of gross national income . 
The US is often said to be more charitable than other countries ; but , in terms of the proportion of the population donating money , Myanmar , Malta , Ireland , the UK , Canada , the Netherlands , and Iceland all do better . 
In Myanmar , 91 % of the people surveyed had given money in the past month ( the corresponding figure for the US is 68 % ) , indicating the strong hold of the Theravada Buddhist tradition of donating to support monks and nuns . 
Myanmar also had the highest percentage of people volunteering time ( 51 % ) . 
The US did , however , have the highest ranking for &quot; helping a stranger . &quot; 
That , together with a high ranking for volunteering time , led it to tie with Myanmar as the most generous nation in the world . 
Admittedly , not all of this giving is altruistic . 
New York &apos;s Lincoln Center announced last month that the billionaire entertainment industry mogul David Geffen has donated $ 100 million toward the renovation of its concert facility , Avery Fisher Hall , on the condition that it is renamed David Geffen Hall . 
That gift seems motivated more by a desire for fame than a desire to do good . 
After all , as Geffen presumably knew , the family of Avery Fisher had to be compensated with a payment of $ 15 million in order to agree to the renaming . 
In any case , in a world with a billion people living in extreme poverty , it would not be difficult for an altruist to appreciate that there are many ways of doing more good than renovating a concert hall for well-off music lovers . 
At the opposite end of the giving spectrum , psychologists who study giving behavior have suggested that people who give small sums of money to a large number of charities may be motivated less by the desire to help others than by the warm glow they get from making a donation . 
By contrast , other donors give larger sums , usually to only a handful of charities chosen on the basis of some knowledge about what the charity is doing . 
They want to have a positive impact on the world . 
Their gifts may also make their lives better , but this is not what motivates them . 
The Effective Altruism movement consists of people who give in the latter way , combining the head and the heart . 
Their aim is to do the most good they can with the resources that they are willing to set aside for that purpose . 
Those resources may include a tenth , a quarter , or even half of their income . 
Their altruism may include their time and talents , and influence their choice of career . 
To achieve their aims , they use reason and evidence to ensure that whatever resources they devote to doing good will be as effective as possible . 
Several studies show that people who are generous are typically happier and more satisfied with their lives than those who do not give . 
And other studies show that giving leads to activity in the reward centers of the brain ( the areas of the brain that are also stimulated by tasty food and sex ) . 
But this does not mean that these donors are not altruistic . 
Their direct motive is to help others , and their giving makes them happier only as a consequence of the fact that it does help others . 
If we had more such people , we would have more giving , and that is what we want . 
To define &quot; altruism &quot; so narrowly that the term can be applied only when giving is contrary to a person &apos;s overall interest would miss the point that the best situation to bring about is one in which promoting the interests of others harmonizes with promoting one &apos;s own .
