Corporate Short-Termism in the Fiscal Cliff &apos;s Shadow 
CAMBRIDGE - Economic trends are sometimes more closely related to one another than news reports make them seem . 
For example , one regularly encounters reports of governments &quot; financial troubles , like the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; in the United States and the debt crisis in Europe . 
And much attention has been devoted , often in nearby opinion pieces , to the view that hyperactive equities markets , particularly in the US and the United Kingdom , push large corporations to focus disproportionately on short-term financial results at the expense of long-term investments in their countries &quot; economies . 
The two are not unconnected . 
And examining that connection provides a good opportunity to assess the weaknesses and ambiguities of the longstanding argument that furiously high-volume stock-market trading shortens corporate time horizons . 
The conventional thinking is that as traders buy and sell corporate stocks more often , they induce corporate managers to plan for shorter and shorter horizons . 
If institutional investors refuse to hold stocks for more than a few months , the thinking goes , CEOs &quot; time horizons for corporate planning must shrink to roughly the same timeframe . 
Policymakers in Europe and the US are urged to act on this conventional thinking : Something must be done to insulate CEOs , boards , and managers from the financial markets &quot; ever-shortening time horizons . 
The UK &apos;s official Kay Review from last July and the European Union &apos;s Green Paper on corporate governance , adopted by the European Parliament earlier this year , diagnose corporate short-termism as a serious problem and point policymakers toward solutions . 
American commentators - and , increasingly , US judges - want to insulate CEOs and boards further from their firms &quot; trading shareholders . 
But highlighting short-term trading in stock markets obscures other powerful sources of short-termism in corporate time horizons , such as uncertainty about long-term government fiscal policies on both sides of the Atlantic . 
More important , some corporate short-termism may not be as strong as it is thought to be . 
Consider , first , the lofty market capitalization of Apple and other tech companies , which belies the depiction of US financial markets as hopelessly short-term-oriented . 
The ability to appreciate the long-term earnings potential of Silicon Valley and firms like Apple , Amazon , and Facebook suggests that more is going on in the US stock market than a relentless focus on short-term financial performance . 
Indeed , the intermittent over-valuation of entire economic sectors - recall the dot-com bubble from a decade ago - indicates that financial markets are often excessively focused on the long term . 
Many firms during the bubble had no hope of making enough money in the short run to justify their sky-high stock prices . 
Moreover , there are ambiguities in the trend lines for stock-holding periods . 
While the overall average length of time for holding a stock has declined , the impact on senior managers is unclear , because the holding period for core institutional investors , like Vanguard and Fidelity , has not changed in the past decade or two from its two- or three-year baseline . 
Fast program trading pulls the overall holding period average down . 
But it &apos;s not as clear as many believe that the holding period for traditional shareholders has shortened greatly - or at all . 
The declining average is partly due to a furiously trading fringe . 
Excessive short-termism can come from the executive suite as much as from financial markets , especially from CEOs , who in the US have an average tenure of 6-7 years . 
It is fully understandable - and largely supported by empirical evidence - that these CEOs would want good results to occur on their watch , rather than after their successor takes over . 
Insulating CEOs and boards further from financial markets may perversely free them to focus even more narrowly on short-term results . 
In any case , while concern with corporate short-termism has arrived on the US judicial agenda , judges in America ( or elsewhere , for that matter ) are not well positioned to weigh economic evidence that is far from clear regarding the sources , extent , and even the direction of short-term thinking in large corporations . 
Other political and administrative institutions are better positioned to determine whether corporate short-termism is a serious problem and what the best solution would be . 
For example , a so-called Tobin tax on financial transactions is a frequently proposed solution , but it is not a policy solution that could be implemented by corporate-law judges . 
Finally , firms that become more oriented toward short-term performance may be reacting to their real environment , not to their financial environment . 
They may well be adapting to new economic , political , and technological realities , not hiding from the future . 
Critics of short-term thinking , like the authors of the Kay Review and the EU Green Paper , ought to consider that economic life has , in fact , become more short term . 
That brings us to the link between corporate short-termism and weak public finances . 
Companies on both sides of the Atlantic could be thrown off course by the US fiscal cliff and the EU sovereign-debt crisis . 
If economy-defining government and regulatory policies have become unstable in the short and long term , companies must adjust to that reality . 
Similarly , if technological innovation can now transform major industries in a matter of a few years , or even months , long-term investment makes less sense than it did before . 
Amazon &apos;s lofty price / earnings multiple indicates that investors are not shy about financing its long-term future . 
But does Amazon &apos;s success mean that traditional brick-and-mortar retailers are slackers for not upgrading their stores , or for not building new stores in better locations ? 
If investors understand that online distribution is revolutionizing the retail sector , isolating the sector &apos;s CEOs from financial markets would just push more resources into a deteriorating , shrinking business model . 
In this sense ( and only this sense ) , short-term thinking that induces change and movement away from obsolete technology - here and throughout the economy - may well facilitate long-term prosperity .
