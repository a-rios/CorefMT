Uniting Syria 
BERLIN - Syrian opposition activists regularly express disappointment with the level of international support that they receive . 
Although the last meeting of the so-called &quot; Friends of Syria &quot; ( a group of countries that convenes periodically to discuss Syria &apos;s situation outside of the United Nations Security Council ) brought more financial aid , the degree of genuine outside commitment to their cause remains questionable . 
The United States , the European Union , Turkey , and most Arab countries agree that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime is no longer legitimate . 
They have intensified sanctions against the government , and have provided different kinds of support to opposition groups . 
Some states have delivered automatic weapons , ammunition , and rocket-propelled grenades . 
But arms deliveries have dried up , and the rebels &quot; pleas for anti-aircraft weapons remain unanswered . 
Moreover , neither Syria &apos;s neighbors nor Western governments are willing to intervene militarily . 
Indeed , despite expressions of solidarity , they have refused to establish a protection zone for Syrian civilians along the border of neighboring states , or to impose a no-fly zone for Syrian military aircraft . 
As a result , Syrian opposition groups believe that they have been left to confront Assad &apos;s brutal regime alone . 
But Syrian oppositionists must recognize that the lack of decisive international action is not only the result of Russia and China vetoing any meaningful action in the Security Council , or NATO countries &quot; unwillingness to enter into another war in the region . 
In fact , the international community is waiting for Syria &apos;s disorganized opposition to transform itself into a coherent , effective force as much as the opposition is waiting for the international community . 
This entails forming a common platform that represents all relevant groups , including the Local Coordination Committees , the Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union , and the Free Syrian Army &apos;s military councils . 
To be sure , the rebels have made some progress . 
They have created four regional military councils , which have helped to consolidate leadership and solidify their control over significant areas of the country , particularly near the Turkish border . 
Yet the Syrian opposition has so far failed to present itself as a unified actor . 
This is astonishing , given that highly respected , influential figures and political parties have been speaking for the opposition at international gatherings . 
The Syrian National Council ( SNC ) , for example , includes many such figures , and has managed to gain material support from several countries . 
But it is not inclusive enough to serve as the Syrian opposition &apos;s sole representative . 
Attempts to enlarge the SNC have been unsuccessful , owing to reservations expressed by some important groups , such as the Democratic Forum , about joining an organization that relies on foreign sponsors . 
The Syrian opposition needs to establish an umbrella organization accepted by all , including the de facto civilian and military leaders who have emerged locally over the last year and a half . 
These groups already share a common goal - to bring down Assad &apos;s regime - and most of them ( with a few ultra-militant exceptions ) hope to build a peaceful , inclusive , and democratic state . 
Influential opposition figures - such as former parliamentarian and political prisoner Riad Seif and the SNC &apos;s former leader , Burhan Ghalioun - have proposed promising strategies for forming such an umbrella organization . 
For example , a &quot; group of wise persons &quot; who do not seek political positions could oversee the creation of a provisional council that includes all relevant political groups and coalitions , the military councils , the business community , and religious leaders . 
But such plans have not been realized , owing to the absence of a cooperative culture . 
Given that Syrians were socialized in a deeply authoritarian system , even those who are fighting for a democratic system are inexperienced in the art of coalition building . 
Also , potential politicians have never been able really to measure their popularity in democratic contests . 
As a result , not a few of them overestimate their actual influence and tend to compete for leadership rather than cooperate . 
Syria &apos;s opposition leaders do not need to sweep their political differences under the rug in order to gain the international community &apos;s support . 
They simply need to create a common body that all relevant groups on the ground can accept , as the Libyan opposition did when it set up the National Transitional Council . 
After that , they should establish a legitimate authority inside Syria that can administer liberated areas , distribute aid , and provide services to civilians . 
Such a transitional authority could call upon the international community for needed support more easily than an exiled rebel group could . 
The Syrian revolution is essentially a civilian and political rebellion against dictatorship - one that is gradually unraveling Assad &apos;s regime . 
The opposition must begin to lay the groundwork for a new order based on unity and cooperation . 
Otherwise , smaller groups of armed militants - supported , or even manipulated , by external actors - will dictate Syria &apos;s future .
