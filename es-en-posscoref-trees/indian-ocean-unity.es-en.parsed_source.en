Indian Ocean Unity 
NEW DELHI - What international association brings together 18 countries straddling three continents thousands of miles apart , united solely by their sharing of a common body of water ? 
That is a quiz question likely to stump the most devoted aficionado of global politics . 
It &apos;s the Indian Ocean Rim Countries &quot; Association for Regional Cooperation , blessed with the unwieldy acronym IOR-ARC , perhaps the most extraordinary international grouping you &apos;ve never heard of . 
The Association manages to unite Australia and Iran , Singapore and India , Madagascar and the United Arab Emirates , and a dozen other states large and small - unlikely partners brought together by the fact that the Indian Ocean washes their shores . 
I &apos;ve just come back ( as India &apos;s new Minister of State for External Affairs ) from attending the Association &apos;s ministerial meeting in Sana &apos;a , Yemen . 
Despite being accustomed to my eyes glazing over at the alphabet soup of international organizations I &apos;ve encountered during a three-decade-long United Nations career , I find myself excited by the potential of IOR-ARC . 
Regional associations have been created on a variety of premises : geographical , as with the African Union ; geopolitical , as with the Organization of American States ; economic and commercial , as with ASEAN or Mercosur ; and security-driven , as with NATO . 
There are multi-continental ones too , like IBSA , which brings together India , Brazil , and South Africa , or the better-known G-8 . 
Even Goldman Sachs can claim to have invented an inter-governmental body , since the &quot; BRIC &quot; concept coined by that Wall Street firm was recently institutionalized by a meeting of the heads of government of Brazil , Russia , India , and China in Yekaterinburg last month . 
But it &apos;s fair to say there &apos;s nothing quite like IOR-ARC in the annals of global diplomacy . 
For one thing , there isn &apos;t another ocean on the planet that takes in Asia , Africa , and Oceania ( and could embrace Europe , too , since the French department of Reunion , in the Indian Ocean , gives France observer status in IOR-ARC , and the French foreign ministry is considering seeking full membership ) . 
For another , every one of Samuel Huntington &apos;s famously clashing civilizations finds a representative among its members , giving a common roof to the widest possible array of worldviews in their smallest imaginable combination ( just 18 countries ) . 
When IOR-ARC meets , new windows are opened between countries separated by distance as well as politics . 
Malaysians talk with Mauritians , Arabs with Australians , South Africans with Sri Lankans , and Iranians with Indonesians . 
The Indian Ocean serves as both a sea separating them and a bridge linking them together . 
The potential of the organization is huge . 
There are opportunities to learn from one another , to share experiences , and to pool resources on such issues as blue-water fishing , maritime transport , and piracy ( in the Gulf of Aden and the waters off Somalia , as well as in the straits of Malacca ) . 
But IOR-ARC doesn &apos;t have to confine itself to the water : it &apos;s the countries that are members , not just their coastlines . 
So everything from the development of tourism in the 18 countries to the transfer of science and technology is on the table . 
The poorer developing countries have new partners from which to receive educational scholarships for their young and training courses for their government officers . 
There is already talk of new projects in capacity building , agriculture , and the promotion of cultural cooperation . 
This is not to imply that IOR-ARC has yet fulfilled its potential in the decade that it has existed . 
As often happens with brilliant ideas , the creative spark consumes itself in the act of creation , and IOR-ARC has been treading water , not having done enough to get beyond the declaratory phase that marks most new initiatives . 
The organization itself is lean to the point of emaciation , with just a half-dozen staff ( including the gardener ! ) in its Mauritius secretariat . 
The formula of pursuing work in an Academic Group , a Business Forum , and a Working Group on Trade and Investment has not yet brought either focus or drive to the parent body . 
But such teething pains are inevitable in any new group , and the seeds of future cooperation have already been sown . 
Making a success of an association that unites large countries and small ones , island states and continental ones , Islamic republics , monarchies , and liberal democracies , and every race known to mankind , represents both a challenge and an opportunity . 
This diversity of interests and capabilities can easily impede substantive cooperation , but it can also make such cooperation far more rewarding . 
In this diversity , we in India see immense possibilities , and in Sana &apos;a we pledged ourselves to energizing and reviving this semi-dormant organization . 
The brotherhood of man is a tired clich√© , but the neighborhood of an ocean is a refreshing new idea . 
The world as a whole stands to benefit if 18 littoral states can find common ground in the churning waters of a mighty ocean .
