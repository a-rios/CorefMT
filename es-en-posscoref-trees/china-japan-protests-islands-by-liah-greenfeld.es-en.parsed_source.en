The Roots of Chinese / Japanese Rivalry 
BOSTON - The anti-Japan protests that continue to roil China are just another indication of the rise of a potent Chinese nationalism . 
After a century slowly fomenting among Chinese intellectuals , national sentiment has captured and redefined the consciousness of the Chinese people during the last two decades of China &apos;s economic boom . 
This mass national consciousness launched the Chinese colossus into global competition to achieve an international status commensurate with the country &apos;s vast capacities and the Chinese people &apos;s conception of their country &apos;s rightful place in the world . 
Rapidly , visibly , and inevitably , China has risen . 
Indeed , our era will likely be remembered as the time when a new global order , with China at the helm , was born . 
Competitive national consciousness - the consciousness that one &apos;s individual dignity is inseparably tied to the prestige of one &apos;s &quot; people &quot; - worked its way into the minds of China &apos;s best and brightest between 1895 and 1905 . 
In 1895 , China was defeated by Japan , a tiny aggressor whom the Chinese dismissively called wa ( the dwarf ) . 
China was already accustomed to rapacious Western powers squabbling over its riches , but had remained self-confident in the knowledge of these powers &quot; irrelevance . 
However , the assault from Japan , a speck of dust in its own backyard , shattered this self-assurance and was experienced as a shocking and intolerable humiliation . 
Japan &apos;s triumph in 1905 over &quot; the Great White Power , &quot; Russia , repaired the damage to China &apos;s sense of dignity . 
From the Chinese point of view , Russia was a formidable European power , one feared by other Western powers . 
Its defeat , therefore , was seen as a successful Asian challenge to the West , in which China , its intellectuals felt , was represented by Japan . 
Japan thus became the focus of Chinese attention . 
Gentlemen-scholars , who would reform and staff the Chinese army and civil service in the early decades of the twentieth century , went to study in Japan . 
The Revolution of 1911 was inspired by the example of Japan &apos;s Meiji Restoration ; and , because early-twentieth-century Japan was stridently nationalistic , the new China that emerged from its image was constructed on nationalist principles as well . 
Thus Japan became the significant &quot; other &quot; for China , the model that was imitated and the anti-model that was resented . 
Chinese nationalism borrowed from Japan its concept of the nation , including the very word by which it was expressed ( kuoming , from the Japanese kokumin ) . 
The 
Paradoxically , but not unexpectedly , Mao Zedong &apos;s struggle against the Kuomintang was inspired by anti-Japanese nationalism as well . 
As was the case virtually everywhere else , communism in China was nationalism incarnate . 
Mao &apos;s speech on the establishment of the People &apos;s Republic plainly expressed the nationalist agenda behind it . 
Calling the nation &quot; communist &quot; assured the new People &apos;s Republic of China of the Soviet Union &apos;s support , which was viewed by Mao as more reliable than that of the United States . 
But neither the Russian nor the Chinese Communists were ever unclear about the nationalist nature of their respective projects . 
The upper echelons of the bureaucracy and intelligentsia in Russia and China were self-consciously nationalist and , throughout Communist rule , shrewdly pursued the supreme nationalist goal : prestige - the power , naked and otherwise , to impose the nation &apos;s will on others . 
But national consciousness , particularly in China , was limited to a narrow elite , leaving the masses almost untouched . 
This changed dramatically with the Chinese government &apos;s restoration of a capitalist economy . 
Much like in Germany in the 1840 &quot; s , when the appeal to private enterprise converted the entire middle class to nationalism , the explicit definition of economic power as the central pillar of China &apos;s greatness awakened ordinary Chinese to nationalism &apos;s appeal . 
Hundreds of millions now see themselves as sharing in the nation &apos;s dignity , and are eager to contribute to it , as well as to defend it from insult . 
Competition for prestige , even when the contest is economic , is not a purely rational undertaking . 
So it should be no surprise that old injuries are likely to resurface . 
Some Chinese , especially those who are not economically successful , harp bitterly on Japan &apos;s past depredations . 
Despite China &apos;s embrace of capitalism and Japanese investment , Japan remains China &apos;s reviled other . 
Indeed , a professor in Beijing told me not long ago , &quot; Two in every ten Chinese dislike the US , but nine in every ten hate Japan . &quot; 
For the West , there is a silver lining in this nationalist rivalry : neither China nor Japan is a rogue state , and , so long as their quarrels do not lead to the use of unconventional weapons , we may treat the friction between them as an internal Asian quarrel . 
Japan , moreover , is likely to let today &apos;s passions over disputed islands in the East China Sea cool down , despite the anti-Japanese outbursts in Chinese cities . 
But the West - and the US in particular - is new to dignity games Ã  la Chinois . 
If it gets carried away and presumes to talk down to the 5,000-year-old culture of the Sages , the West could become the next object of China &apos;s nationalist resentment .
