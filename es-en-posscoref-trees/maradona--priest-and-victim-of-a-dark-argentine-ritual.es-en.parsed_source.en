Maradona : Priest and Victim of a Dark Argentine Ritual 
At the edge of death , but still clinging to life , Diego Maradona seems these days both priest and victim of a tragic Argentine ritual . 
Intense and long suffering , Argentines know how to create universal heroes like Eva Perón and Ché Guevara . 
The Argentine football star nearly rose to that lofty pedestal . 
Evita and Ché were serious people throughout their public careers . 
They gave themselves over to huge , dangerous , and heroic deeds . 
They fought to change the world and they willingly carried the burdens of legions of people on their shoulders . 
Both demanded too much from their fragile health . 
Death at an early age ended their lives . 
Political failure killed Ché , and illness took Evita &apos;s life , possibly saving her from the kind of political calamity that befell her husband a few years later . 
For both , early death elevated their stature in the alchemy of history . 
The old never make good heroes . 
Early death evokes a beautiful destiny interrupted before its pinnacle - and hence before it tumbles into inevitable collapse . 
However irrational , this is a powerful idea . 
So what we celebrate in these tragic heroes are people much like us , but with an uncommon talent and capacity to lend historical resonance to their destiny . 
We celebrate them as individuals who demonstrate how far we can travel in life , how beautiful human beings can actually be . 
But to be effective in the cause of heroism , the hero must die promptly . 
Maradona , however , is no tragic hero . 
He is a hero of happiness . 
His battles were in a decidedly popular art . 
His expulsion from the 1982 World Cup for illegal drug use placed him , in the public &apos;s mind , on the path to tragedy , but the long cord of death , already tugging at him , had put him there years before . 
Like Evita and Ché , he bore the people &apos;s burden of expectation on his shoulders . 
True , his task was lighter , but that didn &apos;t lessen the weight of the burden . 
Maradona &apos;s helpless soul was suffocated by the people &apos;s obsessive and suffocating love ; at the same time , he couldn &apos;t live without that addictive drug . 
He was a prisoner of both his genius and his insatiable need for the Argentine public &apos;s love . 
Now that he &apos;s no longer playing football , Argentines demand even more . 
They want to hear him speak , to know his stories , to feel his presence . 
But life , unlike football , has more difficult consequences than losing a game . 
Maradona fails to understand this . 
He fails to face his addictions - to the fast life and to his not always healthy , but always demanding and unreal relationship with Argentines . 
Each time , he moves a little closer toward death . 
He likes to proclaim , &quot; I &apos;m only a football player . 
I &apos;m no role model for anyone . &quot; 
But no one hears him . 
Instead , photographers stake out his hospital room , seeking to show us our hero in his struggle with death . 
There he is , vulnerable , fat , and weak , but we expect strength . 
Maradona has been condemned to lie naked in front of millions of his fans , and his country has been condemned to pursue and reclaim him with its suffocating passion . 
So tragic a ritual can have no good end . 
But it tells us something about Argentine heroes and their fans . 
The ritual tells us that we are desperately zealous people , seeking mirrors that show our heroes as beautiful , youthful , and exceptional ; that we are fascinated with a form of death that freezes our illusions into permanent images , like Evita &apos;s embalmed corpse . 
Poor Maradona . 
We , his fellow Argentines , bear ancient sorrows as well as new ones . 
We have not yet properly mourned , nor reflected upon , our nation &apos;s systematic fall into poverty ; nor the disappearance of former President Carlos Saúl Menem &apos;s mirage of a First World Argentina ; nor our institutions &apos; loss of legitimacy ; nor our corruption and our violence . 
I don &apos;t blame Maradona for staying away from the country in the last few years . 
There is enough sorrow in Argentina without him . 
Sadly , he has now become the victim of our collective sorrow . 
It &apos;s no surprise that his health has grown worse since his return . 
Even when he could scarcely breathe with the help of an automatic respirator , Argentines wanted him to assume his role in their dark ritual : &quot; Show us a good time , bring our hearts some fun . &quot; 
Near the hospital , in the clear air , on a street of the sad city that invented the tango , the dark ceremony is nearing completion , just as if it were taking place in a temple . 
Messages , snatches of diary entries , and photos are plastered on the hospital &apos;s walls . 
Many people gather outside ; some pray ; others have built pagan altars . 
The songs of Fito Paéz , another popular artist , rise through the air , accompanied by the necessary melancholy intoned by the crowds . 
This seems a desperate farewell : 
&quot; Show us a good time , bring our hearts some fun . &quot; 
But what can our hero do at this hour ? 
He &apos;s preoccupied with his own enlarged heart , which , though weary , continues to beat . 
I have some advice for you , Diego : now that the hospital has discharged you , pack your bags and head for the airport .
