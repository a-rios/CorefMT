China &apos;s Dangerous Nobodies 
Ever since their reinvention by Pierre de Coubertin , the Olympic Games have always been politicized . 
The first took place in 1896 in Athens in order to embarrass the Turks still occupying Northern Greece . 
The Berlin Games in 1936 celebrated the triumph of Nazi ideology . 
The Seoul Games in 1988 opened the door to South Korea &apos;s democratization . 
This summer &apos;s Olympics in Beijing will be no less political , but will it resemble Berlin or Seoul ? 
Will it mark the apotheosis of an authoritarian regime or the beginning of its demise ? 
Many optimistic observers of China , often mollified by their close relations with the Communist regime , bet on a soft transition from despotism toward an open society , but recent events don &apos;t support such a benign interpretation . 
Since the beginning of this year , repression of human rights activists , lawyers , and bloggers has been harsher than ever . 
The exact number of democratic dissidents who have been incarcerated , or worse , is unknown . 
There is no way to account for ignored victims , or why some are condemned to death and shot . 
We don &apos;t know how many are sent without trial to &quot; re-education centers . &quot; 
In the absence of reliable statistics , let us focus on two iconic figures of China &apos;s pro-democracy movement : Hu Jia and Chen Guancheng . 
Last December 27 , 20 armed police officers used extreme physical violence to arrest Hu Jia in front of his wife and their two-month-old baby , acting as if he could offer real resistance . 
Moreover , he is a committed believer in non-violence , an admirer of the Dalai Lama , a disciple of the Mahatma Gandhi , and a sincere Buddhist . 
Why is the mighty Chinese Communist Party deploying all of its powers to kidnap - no word better describes what happened - such a tiny enemy ? 
The Party accuses him of &quot; subversion , &quot; but he broke no laws , does not head a counter-revolutionary army , and was not on the verge of toppling the Party . 
Hu Jia &apos;s political actions are much more modest than that . 
In 2000 , he abandoned his studies at Beijing University when he learned that thousands of Henan peasants were dying from AIDS after having sold their blood to local traffickers . 
Since the beginning of this epidemic , his main activity has been the distribution of medicine and moral comfort in the doomed villages of Henan . 
Hu Jia &apos;s charitable work is not facilitated by the local authorities , who bear some responsibility in this epidemic ; moreover , with NGOs being forbidden in China , Hu Jia can act only by himself . 
Indeed , if he were to build any kind of organization to support his charity , he would be violating the law . 
But the eye-opening tragedy of the Henan victims caused Hu Jia to understand that it arose from the absence of human rights in China . 
This Web site , now closed by the government , has also reported on the fate of Chen Guangcheng . 
Chen , a blind peasant and self-taught lawyer , had protested in 2005 against the kidnapping of some 3000 women in his hometown of Linyi . 
The women were sterilized or forced into having abortions in order to stabilize the population increase in the region . 
As this extreme violence violates Chinese law , Chen petitioned the central government - the only legally recognized form of protest in China . 
When carrying his petition to Beijing , escorted by a tiny group of lawyers , Chen was accused of disrupting traffic on the city &apos;s clogged roads and condemned to four years in jail . 
Why do such moderate actions , rooted in the Chinese moral tradition , provoke such dramatic repression ? 
Hu and Chen clearly respect the law . 
They don &apos;t call for revolution . 
True enough , they talk to foreign journalists who report their actions ; however , such contact is not illegal . 
But the Party is haunted by the Soviet precedent . 
No Chinese Sakharov or Solzhenitsyn will be allowed to tarnish the &quot; success &quot; of the Party . 
The incarceration of Hu Jia and Chen Guangcheng is a clear signal that no democratization process will start in China outside of the Party &apos;s control . 
When the Chinese leaders mention democracy in official declarations , they mean &quot; organized &quot; democracy , from the top down . 
Any attempt at democratization by civil society will thus be crushed in its infancy . 
China is clearly not on the path toward a Western-style democracy , and economic growth will not be a prelude to a free society so long as the Party can prevent it . 
The regime &apos;s true ambition is to invent an alternative to Western democracy : an enlightened despotism under the tutelage of a meritocratic Communist Party . 
The Olympic Games are being designed to promote this alternative model . 
How legitimate is this model ? 
The Party &apos;s 60 million members , nearly all males and city dwellers , would probably approve , as might the 200 million Chinese who share the profits of rapid economic growth . 
No one knows , because they cannot express their wishes . 
Perhaps Hu Jia and Chen Guancheng represent this silent billion more than the Party does . 
That would explain why the Party has crushed them - and why any decent participant in this summer &apos;s Olympics should demand their immediate release .
