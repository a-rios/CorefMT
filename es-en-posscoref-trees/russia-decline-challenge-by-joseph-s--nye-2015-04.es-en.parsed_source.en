The Challenge of Russia &apos;s Decline 
CAMBRIDGE - As Europe debates whether to maintain its sanctions regime against Russia , the Kremlin &apos;s policy of aggression toward Ukraine continues unabated . 
Russia is in long-term decline , but it still poses a very real threat to the international order in Europe and beyond . 
Indeed , Russia &apos;s decline may make it even more dangerous . 
Make no mistake : what is happening in Ukraine is Russian aggression . 
President Vladimir Putin &apos;s pretense that Russian troops were not participating in the fighting was all but shattered recently , when a Russian fighter in Donetsk confirmed to the BBC Russian service that they are playing a decisive role in rebel advances . 
But the threat posed by Russia extends far beyond Ukraine . 
After all , Russia is the one country with enough missiles and nuclear warheads to destroy the US . 
As its economic and geopolitical influence has waned , so has its willingness to consider renouncing its nuclear status . 
Indeed , not only has it revived the Cold War-era tactic of sending military aircraft unannounced into airspace over the Baltic countries and the North Sea ; it has also made veiled nuclear threats against countries like Denmark . 
Weapons are not Russia &apos;s only strength . 
The country also benefits from its enormous size , vast natural resources , and educated population , including a multitude of skilled scientists and engineers . 
But Russia faces serious challenges . 
It remains a &quot; one-crop economy , &quot; with energy accounting for two-thirds of its exports . 
And its population is shrinking - not least because the average man in Russia dies at age 65 , a full decade earlier than in other developed countries . 
Though liberalizing reforms could cure Russia &apos;s ailments , such an agenda is unlikely to be embraced in a corruption-plagued country with an emphatically illiberal leadership . 
Putin , after all , has sought to promote a neo-Slavophile identity defined above all by suspicion of Western cultural and intellectual influence . 
Instead of developing a strategy for Russia &apos;s long-term recovery , Putin has adopted a reactive and opportunistic approach - one that can sometimes succeed , but only in the short term - to cope with domestic insecurity , perceived external threats , and the weakness of neighbors . 
He has waged unconventional war in the West , while pursuing closer ties with the East , raising the likelihood that Russia will end up acting as China &apos;s junior partner , without access to the Western capital , technology , and contacts that it needs to reverse its decline . 
But Russia &apos;s problem is not just Putin . 
Though Putin has cultivated nationalism in Russia - according to Harvard University &apos;s Timothy Colton , at a recent meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club , Putin called himself the country &apos;s &quot; biggest nationalist &quot; - he found fertile ground to plow . 
Given that other high-level figures - for example , Dmitry Rogozin , who last October endorsed a book calling for the return of Alaska - are also highly nationalistic , a successor to Putin would probably not be liberal . 
The recent assassination of former Deputy Prime Minister and opposition leader Boris Nemtsov reinforces this assumption . 
So Russia seems doomed to continue its decline - an outcome that should be no cause for celebration in the West . 
States in decline - think of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 - tend to become less risk-averse and thus much more dangerous . 
In any case , a thriving Russia has more to offer the international community in the long run . 
In the meantime , the US and Europe face a policy dilemma . 
On one hand , it is important to resist Putin &apos;s challenge to the fundamental principle that states should not use force to violate one another &apos;s territorial integrity . 
Though sanctions are unlikely to change Crimea &apos;s status or lead to withdrawal of Russian soldiers from Ukraine , they have upheld that principle , by showing that it cannot be violated with impunity . 
On the other hand , it is important not to isolate Russia completely , given shared interests with the US and Europe relating to nuclear security and non-proliferation , terrorism , space , the Artic , and Iran and Afghanistan . 
No one will benefit from a new Cold War . 
Reconciling these objectives will not be easy , especially given Ukraine &apos;s continuing crisis . 
At February &apos;s Munich Security Conference , many US senators advocated arming Ukraine - an approach that could exacerbate the situation , given Putin &apos;s conventional military dominance there . 
With German leaders , including Chancellor Angela Merkel , opposed to this approach , pursuing it would also split the West , strengthening Putin &apos;s hand further . 
Others at the conference argued that the West should change the game by expelling Russia from SWIFT , the international framework for clearing bank payments . 
But critics point out that this would damage SWIFT and the West , whose banks would lose the hundreds of billions of dollars that Russia currently owes them . 
For their part , the Russians have warned informally that this would be &quot; the real nuclear option . &quot; 
Designing and implementing a strategy that constrains Putin &apos;s revisionist behavior , while ensuring Russia &apos;s long-term international engagement , is one of the most important challenges facing the US and its allies today . 
For now , the policy consensus seems to be to maintain sanctions , help bolster Ukraine &apos;s economy , and continue to strengthen NATO ( an outcome that Putin undoubtedly did not intend ) . 
Beyond that , what happens is largely up to Putin .
