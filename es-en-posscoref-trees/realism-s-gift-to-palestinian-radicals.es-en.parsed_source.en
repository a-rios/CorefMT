Realism \ u0027s Gift to Palestinian Radicals 
In support of Ariel Sharon &apos;s plan to evacuate unilaterally all Gaza settlements and a few in the West Bank , the Bush administration backed Israel &apos;s stance on borders and refugees , two of the most important issues of Palestinian-Israeli final status negotiations . 
This position is in clear violation of the text of the &quot; roadmap &quot; to achieve a Palestinian / Israeli peace , which the Bush administration claims it continues to believe in . 
That claim does not withstand scrutiny . 
President Bush assured the Israelis that , given the &quot; new realities on the ground , including already existing major Israeli population centers , &quot; Israel does not have to return all the territories it occupied in 1967 . 
Moreover , in Bush &apos;s view , Israel need not worry about allowing Palestinian refugees to return to their homes inside Israel . 
Instead , the vast majority of refugees are expected to settle in a Palestinian state . 
Given Palestinian public opinion , the most likely outcome of Sharon &apos;s disengagement plan is the empowerment of Hamas and other Palestinian militants . 
By presenting the settlements &apos; evacuation as a unilateral step , Sharon allows Palestinian militants to present it as Israel bowing to the &quot; reality &quot; of defeat inflicted by their armed struggle . 
Indeed , a survey that I conducted in April 2004 found that two-thirds of Palestinians saw the Israeli plan in just this light . 
The same survey showed Hamas with more public support than the nationalist Fatah in the Gaza Strip . 
Israel &apos;s disengagement plan presents the evacuation of Gaza settlements as an end to 37 years of occupation . 
But at the same time , Israel insists that Gaza will not have any attributes of sovereignty and will continue to be governed by existing arrangements covering most aspects of security and civil administration . 
This means that the Israeli military will continue to enter Gaza at will and maintain control over border crossings , airspace , and territorial waters . 
Nor will the Israeli military be withdrawn from the strip of land along the Palestinian-Egyptian border . 
These conditions rule out any possibility of forging a security plan that would receive the support of all factions , including Hamas . 
Under such conditions , the option of Hamas agreeing to a cease-fire and some form of power sharing with the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority would no longer be viable . 
Sharon &apos;s disengagement plan may ultimately render the Gaza Strip little more than a suffocating ghetto isolated from Israel and the rest of the world . 
While the new American positions do not represent a revolutionary change in US policy , they do represent a clear procedural and indeed substantive departure from previous American positions , particularly those of the Clinton administration . 
The so-called &quot; Clinton Parameters , &quot; which were presented just before the end of Clinton &apos;s second term , sought to preclude Israeli annexation of parts of the occupied territories by conditioning any border changes on &quot; territorial swaps and other arrangements . &quot; 
Similarly , while clearly advocating the absorption of refugees in the Palestinian state , the Parameters did not exclude Israel from the list of countries in which refugees could choose to live . 
Indeed , the Palestinians themselves have always agreed to absorb refugees in their future state , but this was conditional on granting refugees the right to choose . 
In almost all previous final status negotiations , Israel has agreed to accept a certain number of refugees as part of its contribution to help close this historical file . 
With his letter , President Bush managed to punish the Palestinians twice : by making significant concessions on their behalf and by excluding them from negotiations . 
On the other hand , Israel was rewarded twice : by receiving US assurances of significant Palestinian concessions , and by being relieved from paying a price in return for these concessions . 
Aside from forcing Palestinian concessions on borders and refugees , the US also relieved Israel of the need to negotiate with the Palestinians until they change their leadership . 
Most discouragingly , the American assurances will likely discredit Palestinian moderates and the positions they have advocated regarding the need for mutual concessions with Israel . 
From now on , the Bush statement will strongly affect the framing of the solution to the issues of territory and refugees . 
Under normal conditions of give and take , the idea of mutual concessions finds acceptance among the majority of Palestinians . 
Now , however , the one-sidedness of the US approach is likely to discredit possible compromises in the eyes of the public . 
Radicals will remind Palestinians that these two concessions represent a US-Israeli imposition and an attempt to force the Palestinians to bow to the realities of occupation and dispossession . 
So concessions that were deemed legitimate and acceptable may now become illegitimate and unacceptable . 
Moderate leaders who advocate these concessions in the context of give-and-take negotiations may become weaker and hardliners stronger . 
For the Palestinians , the bottom line in the Sharon plan and the Bush letter is that diplomacy and negotiations no longer have a role : Israeli unilateralism , combined with American prejudgment , makes that clear . 
The message is that any peace agreement can only come at the expense of Palestinian rights . 
Facts on the ground will be understood as the ultimate arbiters , no matter how illegal and unjust they may be . 
For Israel and its US supporters , this strategy has the seeming appeal of hardheaded realism . 
But attempting to formalize a fait accompli will most likely lead nowhere in the direction of lasting peace , for under such conditions , Palestinians would have no reason to abandon violence .
