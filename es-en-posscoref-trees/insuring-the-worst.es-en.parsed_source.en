Insuring the Worst 
In the nearly six months since Hurricane Katrina destroyed half of New Orleans , many storm victims &quot; expectations of help have been dashed , creating a legacy of bitterness . 
That legacy may be all the more painful when we consider that many homeowners suffered unnecessarily devastating losses because of their lack of insurance or their underinsurance , often owing to the belief that they could not afford the right coverage . 
Future catastrophes - storms , earthquakes , tsunamis , volcano eruptions , forest fires , agricultural or other environmental crises , disease epidemics , or terrorist attacks - are likely to result in the same kinds of problems . 
So it is important to consider the causes of underinsurance and whether our insurance institutions are adequate to the risks that we face . 
According to a report from the Insurance Information Institute , nearly 70 % of homeowners &quot; claims in Louisiana were settled by the end of January , for a total of $ 7.5 billion dollars . 
Sounds good , but there were roughly 200,000 homes that were either severely damaged or destroyed , so the total amounts to less than $ 40,000 per home - far below what was needed . 
Indeed , a large share of New Orleans homeowners - 60 % in Orleans Parish - were completely uninsured against floods . 
Many of those who were insured discovered that clauses in their policies barred them from collecting full benefits . 
In some cases , insurance companies argued that houses were damaged by flood , not wind , which their policies cover more generously . 
That may seem like capricious hair-splitting to people who have suffered a major loss , but such terms are in the insurance contracts that they signed , whether they understood them or not . 
Claims disputes have led to many lawsuits , and many of those who have lost their homes have discovered that the only help available to them now is a low-interest loan . 
Not unreasonably , President George W. Bush wants government grants to bail out only the approximately 20,000 homeowners who can &apos;t be faulted for failing to buy flood insurance , because they lived outside the designated flood plains . 
Despite the disappointments , private insurance is still the best way to deal with possible future disasters . 
Insurance policies that clearly specify the amounts that will be paid and the types of damage that will be covered are far better than the government-administered , after-the-fact bailout that many people seem to have expected . 
Adequate private insurance can be boosted in the future through public education , improved insurance institutions , and lower insurance costs . 
We need to work on all of these agendas , because each must be part of any new plan to deal with the next catastrophe . 
The cost of insurance may be the most serious problem . 
According to estimates by Robert Klein of Georgia State University , homeowners &quot; insurance premiums in Louisiana had already gone up by 70 % between 1997 and 2005 . 
State insurance regulators resist rate increases , but they are ultimately powerless , because insurers can simply take their business elsewhere . 
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) proposed in December that each of America &apos;s 50 states should establish a disaster insurance fund to cover a wide range of big calamities . 
The funds - modeled after similar funds in France and Spain - would be designed to cover the biggest , once-in-fifty-years catastrophes . 
The federal government would then augment the protection up to the once-in-five-hundred-year level . 
The NAIC &apos;S proposal is now under discussion . 
If it were fully implemented , which is unlikely , it would constitute a revolution in risk management in the US similar to that of the creation of Social Security in 1934 . 
But preparation for catastrophe does not have to reside exclusively with the government . 
Mega-disaster risks can be handled with private financial markets , as long as these markets manage to get the full attention and interest of portfolio investors . 
Consider catastrophe bonds ( or &quot; cat bonds &quot; ) , which contain clauses that stipulate that the issuer of the bond ( the borrower ) does not have to repay the money if a specified catastrophe occurs . 
The bonds can be sold to a worldwide market by insurance companies that incur major risks by writing policies . 
If the insurance companies can get a good enough price for such bonds , they can eliminate their exposure to the risk of a major disaster , thereby allowing them to issue policies to homeowners at a lower cost . 
Cat bonds have been growing in importance in recent years . 
According to estimates by Lane Financial , there were $ 1.8 billion worth of cat bonds issued in the year April 2004-March 2005 . 
Since Katrina , issuance has accelerated . 
In the first three post-Katrina months alone ( September to December 2005 ) , $ 2.1 billion were issued . 
The total value of outstanding cat bonds is small by Katrina standards . 
But the trend towards increasing sophistication and breadth of our financial markets suggests that we can expect to see much further growth in cat bonds . 
Ultimately , even Hurricane Katrina and other disasters of similar magnitude are small by world standards . 
The total insured property loss of Katrina , $ 34.4 billion according to an insurance industry estimate , even if expanded to represent uninsured losses , represents a miniscule fraction of world wealth . 
But such disasters represent a much larger share of a single country &apos;s wealth . 
This is why financial theory prescribes spreading risks as evenly as possible around the world , rather than around only one country , as plans for a national catastrophe fund envision . 
The possibility of managing national risks globally is another example of the advantages of economic globalization and expansion of financial markets .
