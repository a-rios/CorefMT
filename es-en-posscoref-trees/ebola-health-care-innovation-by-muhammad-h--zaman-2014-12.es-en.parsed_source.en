Ebola and Innovation 
BOSTON - Lives are not all that have been lost in the ongoing Ebola crisis . 
In recent discussions about how to combat the virus , the methodical rigor of science and medicine has given way to hyperbolic politics and public hysteria . 
To be sure , informed , data-driven public policy to manage the current outbreak must remain a top priority . 
But it is equally important to take stock of the epidemic &apos;s lessons and to ensure that we are prepared for the emergence of other diseases . 
Two major lessons should be learned from the current Ebola outbreak . 
First , the fight against a single disease must not come at the expense of strengthening an entire health-care system . 
Countries with fragile health systems may be able to tackle a given ailment with the help of NGOs and foreign governments , but they are likely to be dangerously unprepared when confronted with unexpected outbreaks of new diseases . 
In Liberia , for example , the prevalence of malaria in children under the age of five declined from 66 % in 2005 to below 32 % in 2011 . 
Nonetheless , when the Ebola virus entered Liberia from neighboring Guinea earlier this year , the country &apos;s health-care infrastructure was quickly overwhelmed . 
More than 2,000 Liberians have died of the disease , and the virus remains rampant . 
Similarly , unless they strengthen the health-care system as a whole , other countries that have performed well in some areas - say , the fight against Ebola - could still face large death tolls and long-term economic turmoil . 
The second lesson that the Ebola epidemic holds concerns major gaps in our ability to develop new methods and technologies to fight the virus and other diseases like it . 
Our policies and approaches have too often been reactive , not proactive . 
The public and non-profit sectors should support innovations that are not only focused on solving immediate problems , but that also address potential future challenges . 
The United States Agency for International Development , the White House Office of Science and Technology , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and the Department of Defense have declared Ebola a &quot; Grand Challenge for Development &quot; and have launched an effort to sponsor practical , cost-effective innovations to treat and prevent it . 
This is an important step in the right direction , but such efforts need to start well before an outbreak if they are to have a significant impact . 
New technologies require time to be tested before they can be deployed in the field , and scaling up to large-scale production is a major challenge for any new invention . 
The Ebola crisis has shown that we need to think about developing our ability to innovate at the most basic level . 
Just as health-care systems in the developing world need to be strengthened , we also need to build up our capacity to develop new solutions for similar challenges when they arise . 
Engineering schools often fail to provide students with knowledge or understanding of the challenges faced by those outside of the developed world . 
Medical students and public-health professionals sometimes study or do internships in places where the disease burden is high ; but a minuscule number of similar opportunities are available to engineers and technologists . 
As a result , talented scientists and engineers are often grossly unaware of problems that need to be solved , and even those that might be motivated to do so are unlikely to apply their training to address new and emerging threats . 
Developing technology takes time and commitment . 
In addition to promoting awareness of global challenges in science and engineering schools , and providing opportunities for students to start addressing them in the field , we need to establish mechanisms that will foster and sustain the ideas that this process brings forward . 
By creating research grants that do not expire as soon as an outbreak is under control , we would substantially increase our portfolio of solutions to manage the next epidemic better . 
When faced with the next Ebola-like challenge , our ability to meet it will depend on the strength of local institutions and our ability to develop the right tools with which to fight it . 
There is no telling how many lives may depend on the steps we take now .
