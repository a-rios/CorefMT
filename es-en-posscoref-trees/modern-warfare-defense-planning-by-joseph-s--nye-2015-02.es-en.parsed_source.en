The Future of Force 
MUNICH - At the World Economic Forum &apos;s recent annual meeting in Davos , I participated in a panel of defense leaders to discuss the future of the military . 
The issue we addressed is a critical one : What kind of war should militaries today be preparing to fight ? 
Governments have a very poor track record when it comes to answering this question . 
After the Vietnam War , for example , the United States &quot; armed forces suppressed what it had learned about counter-insurgency , only to rediscover it the hard way in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
America &apos;s military interventions in these countries exemplify another key challenge of modern warfare . 
As outgoing US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel pointed out in a recent interview , in war , &quot; things can get out of control , and drift and wander &quot; in ways that can cause a military to fall into a more &quot; accelerated &quot; use of force than was initially anticipated . 
Against this background , the notion that force alone can transform conflict-riven societies in the Middle East and elsewhere is a dangerous fallacy . 
But , while war and force may be down , they are not out . 
They are simply evolving according to a new &quot; generation &quot; of rules and tactics . 
The first generation of modern warfare comprised battles fought with massed manpower , using Napoleonic line and column formations . 
The second , which culminated in World War I , was driven by massed firepower , and is expressed in the saying , reportedly coined at the Battle of Verdun in 1916 , &quot; artillery conquers , infantry occupies . &quot; 
And the third generation - perfected by Germany with the &quot; blitzkrieg &quot; method employed in World War II - emphasized maneuver over force , with militaries using infiltration to bypass the enemy and collapse its force from the rear , rather than attacking frontally . 
Fourth-generation warfare takes this decentralized approach one step further , with no definable fronts at all . 
Instead , it focuses on the enemy &apos;s society , reaching deep into its territory to destroy political will . 
One might even add a fifth generation , in which technologies like drones and offensive cyber tactics allow soldiers to remain a continent away from their civilian targets . 
While particular generational delineations are somewhat arbitrary , they reflect an important trend : the blurring of the military front and the civilian rear . 
Accelerating this shift is the replacement of interstate war by armed conflict involving non-state actors such as insurgent groups , terrorist networks , militias , and criminal organizations . 
Confusing matters further is the overlap among these groups , with some even receiving state support . 
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - Latin America &apos;s oldest guerilla group - formed alliances with narcotics cartels . 
Some Taliban groups in Afghanistan and elsewhere developed close ties with transnational Al Qaeda terrorists . 
The insurgents in eastern Ukraine are fighting alongside Russian troops ( bearing no insignias ) . 
Such organizations often take advantage of states that lack the legitimacy or capacity to administer their own territory effectively , launching a mix of political and armed operations that , over time , give them coercive control over local populations . 
The result is what General Sir Rupert Smith , a former British commander in Northern Ireland and the Balkans , called &quot; war among the people &quot; - a kind of struggle that is rarely decided on conventional battlefields by traditional armies . 
These hybrid wars are fought using a wide variety of weapons - not all of which have firepower . 
With cameras in every cell phone and photo-editing software on every computer - not to mention the prevalence of social media - the information contest has become a critical aspect of modern warfare , exemplified in the current wars in Syria and Ukraine . 
In hybrid warfare , conventional and unconventional forces , combatants and civilians , physical destruction and information manipulation become thoroughly intertwined . 
In Lebanon in 2006 , Hezbollah fought Israel through well-trained cells that combined propaganda , conventional military tactics , and rockets launched from densely populated civilian areas , achieving what many in the region considered a political victory . 
More recently , Hamas and Israel have conducted air and land operations in the densely populated Gaza Strip . 
This kind of warfare emerged largely in response to America &apos;s overwhelming conventional military advantage after the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse , underscored by its victory in the 1991 Iraq War , with only 148 American casualties , and its intervention in the 1999 conflict in Kosovo , in which no American lives were lost . 
In the face of this asymmetry , America &apos;s opponents - both state and non-state actors - began to emphasize unconventional tactics . 
In China , for example , military planners developed a strategy of &quot; unrestricted warfare &quot; that combines electronic , diplomatic , cyber , terrorist-proxy , economic , and propaganda tools to deceive and exhaust US systems . 
For their part , terrorist groups , recognizing that they cannot defeat a conventional military in a direct war , attempt to use governments &quot; own power against them . 
With violent theatrics , Osama bin Laden outraged and provoked the US , driving it to overreact in ways that destroyed its credibility , weakened its alliances in the Muslim world , and ultimately exhausted its military - and , in a sense , its society . 
The Islamic State is now employing a similar strategy , mixing ruthless military operations with an incendiary social-media campaign , punctuated by photos and videos of brutal executions , including the beheading of US and other Western citizens . 
These efforts have mobilized the Islamic State &apos;s enemies , while inspiring a growing number of discontented individuals and groups to self-recruit to its banner . 
The unpredictable evolution of warfare poses a serious challenge for defense planners . 
For some weak states , internal threats provide clear objectives . 
The US , for its part , must balance continued support for its conventional military forces , which remain an important deterrent in Asia and Europe , with investment in a broad portfolio of alternative capabilities that conflicts in the Middle East require . 
At a time of unprecedented change , the US - and other major powers - must be ready for anything .
