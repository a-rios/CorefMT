The Moon Illusion 
Few would argue that the Moon is more wondrous and enchanting than when it is near the horizon , appearing closer and looming larger than when it is high in the sky . 
But this is an illusion-the &quot; Moon Illusion , &quot; to be precise : the distance traveled by light reflected from the moon to the eye of an observer is essentially the same regardless of the Moon &apos;s elevation . 
A similar illusion is observed for the setting sun and for celestial distances between star points at different elevations . 
But the Moon Illusion is not only captivating to behold ; it also happens to be perhaps the oldest unsolved problem in science . 
References to it can be found on clay tablets from the royal library of Nineveh and Babylon , dating from before the sixth century BC , as well as in a collection of Chinese legends ascribed to Lieh Tzu dating from the fifth century BC . 
For most of recorded history , the illusion was thought to be a consequence of physical processes . 
For example , Aristotle in the third century BC and Ptolemy in the second century AD incorrectly attributed the illusion to the magnifying properties of the atmosphere . 
Alhazen ( Ibn al-Haytham ) related the illusion to the flattened appearance of the dome of the sky . 
In the nineteenth century , it became clear that the Moon Illusion is psychological , a consequence of the cognitive processes underlying the human brain &apos;s visual space perception . 
Many theories have since been offered to explain the illusion , but there is still little agreement among researchers . 
Most modern explanations treat the illusion as a static phenomenon , in which a stationary observer views a fixed illuminated object over a ground . 
The perceived size of the moon is determined by two factors : the physical extent of the light falling on the eye - also known as the angular subtense or the visual angle - and the distance information provided by the ground . 
Some theorists include in this formulation the perceived distance of the moon ( how far it appears to be from an observer ) . 
The relationships between the stimulus ( visual angle ) and the perceived size and distance of the moon are summarized by the so-called &quot; static size-distance invariance hypothesis &quot; ( SDIH ) : stimulus determines the ratio of perceived size to perceived distance . 
The information from the ground fixes the unique values of each variable in this ratio . 
The SDIH is sometimes assumed to be a fundamental law of visual perception . 
But it is this relationship that makes the Moon Illusion such a puzzle , because applying the SDIH requires that the moon appear farther away if it appears large , and close if it appears small . 
This is also why the illusion has sometimes been called &quot; paradoxical . &quot; 
Since observation contradicts the hypothesis , modern explanations of the Moon Illusion have proposed a variety of changes to the SDIH . 
One modification allows perceived distance to be evoked simultaneously by different behavioral responses . 
Thus , the moon may appear more distant to people who say : &quot; The moon looks close . &quot; 
Other explanations exclude perceived distance . 
Verbal statements about the perceived distance of the moon are described as inferences based on perceived size rather than descriptions of experience : &quot; The Moon looks big so it must be close . &quot; 
Other researchers have gone beyond the SDIH altogether , substituting a perceptual outcome - perceived visual angle - for the stimulus input . 
Unlike the SDIH , this implies a purely psychological relationship . 
But none of these theories answers the age-old question : what accounts for the simultaneous perception of a large and near moon ? 
I have proposed a solution that approaches the illusion from a different starting point . 
I begin with the nature of the perceptual system : What were the circumstances in which it evolved ? 
Clearly , motion was an essential feature . 
Our visual systems evolved in an environment that contained ( mostly ) rigid moving objects . 
Objects that move radially , i.e. , directly toward or away from a viewer , produce a stimulus on the eye that is continuously increasing or decreasing in size . 
Our visual system automatically transforms such changing stimulus inputs into objects that appear to be rigid - i.e. , unchanging in perceived size - but moving radially in three-dimensional space . 
Call this mechanism a type of kinetic form of SDIH . 
Now , how would such a perceptual system respond to the stimulus of the Moon Illusion - a stimulus that changes only in the elevation of the Moon over the ground ? 
The perceived distance of the moon would be determined by contextual stimulus information from the ground and the horizon - when the moon is low , it would appear close ( that is , at or near the apparent distance of the horizon ) and when the moon is high in the sky , it would appear to be at a far greater distance . 
The perceived size of the moon would be determined by the kinetic SDIH , which produces the perception of rigid objects moving radially when stimulus size changes continuously . 
Accordingly , when the object appears to be at different distances , the perceived size of the object must change . 
This makes the moon that appears closer ( i.e. , the moon at the horizon ) also appear larger than the moon that appears farther away . 
Understanding the perceptual system in evolutionary terms makes it possible to uncover the processes that determine our awareness of objects moving in space . 
Presented with an anomalous stimulus such as the moon , this system has graced humanity with a sublime illusion about both the object &apos;s size and its distance .
