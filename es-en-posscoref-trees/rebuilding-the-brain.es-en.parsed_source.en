Rebuilding the Brain 
For many years , it was thought that all of our brain cells ( neurons ) are produced before birth , or exceptionally , up to one or two years after birth , but then the process supposedly stopped . 
From then on , most brain scientists believed , brain circuits could only be modified by altering the synapses , or contacts between existing cells . 
In this view , the total complement of cells , anatomically organized by function and forming major pathways , constituted the brain &apos;s &quot; hardware . &quot; 
The detailed nature of the relation between cells , the modifiable synapses , was the software . 
Starting in the 1960s , evidence suggested that new neurons might be added beyond this early period and even in adulthood . 
This evidence became compelling in the 1980s , based on observations made while studying parts of the songbird brain involved in the acquisition and production of learned song . 
The original observations were met with skepticism , but the birdsong data proved compelling . 
How does one prove that a neuron was born at a particular time ? 
Each cell in the body contains DNA , which is responsible for producing the proteins that are necessary for a cell &apos;s functioning . 
Though all cells in the body have the same DNA , only a subset of the genes encoded by the DNA is expressed in each cell type , thus accounting for the difference between , say , a skin cell , a liver cell , and a brain cell . 
When a cell is about to divide , as happens when tissue grows , the DNA in the mother cell has to be doubled , that is , new DNA is synthesized . 
It is possible to supply the cell with one of the building blocks of the new DNA , and to put a little radioactive tag on that building block . 
Later , scanning through the brain , every time we find a tagged cell we know that it was born at the time we furnished the DNA . 
When we gave adult canaries the tagged DNA building block and then looked for tagged neurons that would have been born one or two days earlier , we found none . 
But if we waited longer - for example , 1-3 weeks , depending on part of brain - we found quite a few tagged neurons . 
This told us that the new neurons were not born by division of existing neurons , but were born elsewhere in the brain and went through a migratory stage during which they were not recognized as neurons . 
It took at least a week for the first new neurons to reach their destination and acquire the looks of an adult neuron . 
We then learned how to identify the future neurons during their migratory journey . 
They were , at that stage , much smaller and had an elongated shape that allowed them to slip between other cells . 
It came as a great surprise when we discovered that the cells giving birth to the new neurons were a type called radial glia , which were thought not to occur in adulthood and were not known to give birth to neurons . 
One of the paradoxes of this process is that in adult birds and mammals the total number of brain cells remains remarkably constant . 
The new neurons replace older ones of the same kind that die - a process of natural rejuvenation . 
There are no hospitals in nature . 
The sudden loss of many brain cells as a result of strokes or injuries must have serious effects on an animal &apos;s survival . 
It seems likely that the replacement of neurons in the adult brain did not evolve to make up losses due to illness or lesion , but as a process of constant renewal , a few cells being replaced every day . 
This idea is so novel that it needs further elaboration . 
In the adult songbird brain , we can find at any moment many little migrating neurons ready to replace cells that have died . 
Only one of every three job seekers finds a job , but the overproduction is probably worthwhile , for it ensures that as a replaceable neuron dies , there will already be , in its vicinity , a younger one ready to take its place . 
As far as known , only a small fraction of all brain cells fall into the replaceable class ; when other kinds of neurons die , they are not replaced . 
We now know that the brain has the potential to grow new brain cells to replace others that have died . 
This potential could be used to repair damaged circuits . 
Laboratories around the world are trying to develop ways to bring this knowledge to clinical situations . 
The trick will be to induce the brain to produce and deliver to the correct destination any kind of neuron that might be needed , so that regardless of cell class , new cells of the required kind can replace others of the same type that have died . 
This goal is not near .
