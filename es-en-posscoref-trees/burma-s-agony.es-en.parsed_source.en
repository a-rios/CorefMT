Burma &apos;s Agony 
As the death toll mounts from the cyclone that struck a densely populated area of Burma stretching from the Irrawaddy Delta to the capital city of Rangoon continues to soar , the country &apos;s military dictatorship is pressing ahead with efforts to consolidate its power . 
The junta leaders have done little to facilitate recovery efforts in the wake of the disaster . 
Indeed , they have announced their intentions to move forward with conducting a national referendum scheduled for Saturday to approve a new constitution , which they hope will entrench their power for decades to come . 
Burma &apos;s rulers have said that the vote will be delayed in the areas hardest hit by the cyclone until May 24 , but the referendum will still go ahead as planned in other parts of the country . 
With this move , the military leaders are putting their sham vote aimed at tightening their repressive grip on power ahead of the well being of the Burmese people . 
This should be no surprise . 
For nearly five decades , Burma &apos;s military rulers have systematically undermined the interests of their own citizens . 
In this latest case , the junta-controlled news media failed to announce warnings about the approaching cyclone . 
The entry of United Nations humanitarian personnel , has been delayed due to the government &apos;s refusal to allow aid workers into the country without first applying for visas . 
Moreover , the military leaders are dragging their feet on easing restrictions on the import of humanitarian supplies and allowing a UN assessment team into the country . 
Some have urged focusing attention on bringing relief efforts to Burma instead of criticizing its government . 
But the reality is that the two issues are connected and the magnitude of the disaster has been made worse by the junta &apos;s single-minded objective of preserving its power . 
The military leaders have shown that they can mobilize their forces in short order when they want , as evidenced by their violent crack down on thousands of monks and political activists last year . 
More than seven months on from this brutal suppression , political activists continue to be imprisoned and tortured . 
Human rights groups report that opponents of the junta &apos;s proposed constitution have been beaten and intimidated in advance of the vote . 
The current pro-military constitution lacks credibility because Aung San Suu Kyi , the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has spent 12 of the past 18 years under house arrest or in prison , and other democratic and ethnic minority leaders have not been allowed to participate in the drafting process . 
Additionally , the new constitution would effectively bar Suu Kyi , from running for president because she was married to a foreigner . 
As the only international actor in direct dialogue with both Burma &apos;s generals and Suu Kyi , the UN is in a position to press for a genuine process of national reconciliation . 
But it &apos;s current approach is not working . 
To date , UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has been addressing the crisis through the use of his &quot; good offices , &quot; with Ibrahim Gambari serving as his representative to Burma &apos;s rulers . 
In his March 2008 briefing to the UN Security Council , Gambari reported that his most recent visit to the country was &quot; frustrating &quot; and acknowledged that no tangible progress was made . 
He was denied meetings with senior government leaders , representatives of ethnic minorities and political opposition groups . 
The outcome was a major step backward . 
This lack of progress is less a reflection of Gambari &apos;s capabilities than of the fact that he has not been empowered by the countries that hold the most leverage over Burma &apos;s rulers , including China , India , and Burma &apos;s ASEAN neighbors . 
The &quot; good offices &quot; approach is effective when the weight of the world is behind it and , put simply , Gambari has not been given the clout he needs . 
Since the countries that carry the most sway with the junta also have strong commercial interests in Burma , we should not expect any of them to step up and take the lead on their own . 
As Secretary-General , Ban has lived up to his self-styled vision of being the consummate diplomat , and has made some important gains in tackling the UN &apos;s bureaucratic bloat as well as dealing with the Middle East . 
But on other issues , Ban has failed to live up to the critically important precedent set by his predecessor as Secretary-General , Kofi Annan , who transformed the position to promote human rights and assumed the role of the &quot; world &apos;s conscience &quot; when necessary . 
Burma &apos;s deterioration demands that Ban stop managing and begin to lead . 
He should begin by demanding that Burma &apos;s government fulfill its responsibility to protect the country &apos;s citizens and condemn the use of violence and repressive tactics . 
Given the Burmese generals &apos; hard line stance to date , it will likely prove to be necessary for Ban to go to Burma to meet face-to-face with its leaders . 
One idea is to pressure the generals to agree to multiparty talks based on the North Korean model-an , approach that Ban helped to forge from his days as South Korea &apos;s Foreign Minister . 
While the world watches , Burma &apos;s generals are consolidating their tyrannical rule as hundreds of thousands of the cyclone &apos;s survivors remain in desperate need of shelter , clean drinking water and medical care . 
The situation demands the Secretary-General &apos;s direct involvement . 
Without it , the junta will continue to have a free hand to act against the human rights of the Burmese people .
