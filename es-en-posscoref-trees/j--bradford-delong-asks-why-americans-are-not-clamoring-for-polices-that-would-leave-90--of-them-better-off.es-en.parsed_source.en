The Strange Case of American Inequality 
BERKELEY - Unless something goes unexpectedly wrong in 2014 , the level of real per capita GDP in the United States will match and exceed its 2007 level . 
That is not good news . 
To see why , consider that , during the two business cycles that preceded the 2007 downturn , the US economy &apos;s real per capita GDP grew at a 2 % average annual pace ; indeed , for a century or so , the US economy &apos;s real per capita GDP grew at that rate . 
So US output is now seven years - 14 % - below the level that was reasonably expected back in 2007 . 
And there is nothing on the horizon that would return the US economy to - or even near - its growth path before the 2008 financial crisis erupted . 
The only consolation - and it is a bleak consolation indeed - is that Europe and Japan are doing considerably worse relative to the 2007 benchmark . 
The US economy &apos;s annual per capita underperformance in 2014 will thus amount to $ 9,000 . 
By the end of 2014 , the cumulative per capita waste from the crisis and its aftermath will total roughly $ 60,000 . 
If we project that forward - with nothing visible to restore the US to its pre-2008 growth path - at the annual real discount rate of 6 % that we apply to equity earnings , the future costs are $ 150,000 per capita . 
If we use the 1.6 % annual real discount rate at which the US Treasury can borrow via 30-year inflation-protected Treasuries , the future per capita costs are $ 550,000 . 
And if we combine the costs of idle workers and capital during the downturn and the harm done to the US economy &apos;s future growth path , the losses reach 3.5-10 years of total output . 
That is a higher share of America &apos;s productive capabilities than the Great Depression subtracted - and the US economy is 16 times larger than it was in 1928 ( 5.5 times larger in per capita terms ) . 
So , unless something - and it will need to be something major - returns the US to its pre-2008 growth trajectory , future economic historians will not regard the Great Depression as the worst business-cycle disaster of the industrial age . 
It is we who are living in their worst case . 
One would think that America &apos;s leaders would be clambering to formulate policies aimed at returning the economy to its pre-2008 growth path : putting people back to work , cleaning up underwater mortgages , restoring financial markets &quot; risk-bearing capacity , and boosting investment . 
But no . 
Part of the reason is that , at the top , there is no crisis . 
According to the best estimates , the income share of America &apos;s top 10 % probably crossed 50 % in 2012 for the first time ever , and the 22 % income share that went to the top 1 % was exceeded only in 2007 , 2006 , and 1928 . 
The incomes of America &apos;s top 10 % are two-thirds higher than those of their counterparts 20 years ago , while the incomes of the top 1 % have more than doubled . 
Those who fall into the top strata thus regard themselves as doing well in the current US economy . 
Only those who spend more time talking to competent macroeconomists than is healthy know that they could be doing even better if the economy were rebalanced at full employment . 
So the absence of distress among America &apos;s top 10 % and its top 1 % - and hence political pressure for measures to return the economy to its pre-2008 growth path - is understandable . 
But , for everyone else - roughly 90 % of the US population - there has been no jump in income share relative to ten or 20 years ago to offset what now looks to be a permanent lost decade . 
On the contrary , the bottom 90 % has continued to lose ground . 
When income inequality began to rise in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , those of us who cut our teeth on the long march of North Atlantic history expected to see a political reaction . 
Democratic politics , we thought , would check the rising power of a largely parasitic economic over-class , especially if its influence caused governments to fail to live up to their commitments to provide full employment with increasing - and increasingly shared - prosperity . 
After all , in early-nineteenth-century Britain , growing inequality caused by the Industrial Revolution gave rise to movements for government regulation in the interests of the middle and working classes , and for a rebalancing of real incomes away from rich landlords . 
Similarly , the Great Depression produced enormous political pressure for reform and change ( often for destructive and dangerous change , to be sure , but pressure nonetheless ) . 
Why can &apos;t America launch similar movements today ? 
To the extent that this has become a valid question , most Americans should be as worried today about the quality of their democracy as they are about the inequality of their incomes .
