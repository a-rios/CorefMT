The Necessity of NATO 
BRUSSELS - Many years ago , I took my children to visit the sites of the D-Day landings in Normandy . 
We saw the beaches whose names echo through history - Omaha , Utah , Juno . 
Those beaches remain a memorial to the idea that , together , we can overcome any threat , no matter how great . 
We understand the future that could have befallen not only Europe , but the entire world , if North America had not helped Europe in its hour of need . 
And we know that those landings created a unique bond between our continents . 
That bond remains vital for the preservation of our values and our security . 
But , after the Cold War , many assumed that its institutional embodiment - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - would fade away . 
It did not , because our bond is based not just on common threats , but on shared ideals . 
It could no more fade away than our desire for freedom could wane . 
NATO needed no external reasons to exist . 
In Bosnia and Kosovo , NATO intervened to stop massive human-rights violations . 
In Libya , we enforced a United Nations Security Council resolution to protect civilians . 
And in Afghanistan , we are denying a safe haven to extremists . 
The Alliance has evolved into a true security-management organization that is flexible , efficient , and cost-effective . 
The threats have changed , and become more global , and we have changed to meet them . 
NATO is developing a ballistic-missile defense capability to protect our European populations and territory against a grave and growing threat . 
In the Indian Ocean , NATO is working with the European Union and many others to police major sea lanes threatened by pirates . 
And , in countries around the world , it carries out tasks such as de-mining , disaster relief , advising on how to bring military forces under democratic control , and working closely with the UN to prevent harm to children . 
Efforts like these may not make headlines . 
But security is like health - you never notice it until it takes a turn for the worse . 
This is why you need insurance . 
And NATO is the most solid security insurance that the world has . 
Underwritten by 28 members , it has delivered security benefits to all Allies , year after year , for more than six decades . 
This weekend in Chicago , representatives of roughly 60 member states , partner countries , and international organizations will assemble for NATO &apos;s latest summit , the largest in the Alliance &apos;s history , to tackle some of the biggest security questions of our time . 
Our discussions will focus on three issues : the transition to full Afghan security responsibility , the continued development of Allied military capabilities , and NATO &apos;s global network of partnerships . 
First , we will reaffirm our commitment to Afghanistan &apos;s stability and security . 
Over the next few months , our role will shift from combat to training and mentoring . 
And , by the end of 2014 , Afghans will have full responsibility for their own security . 
Second , as our military involvement in Afghanistan nears completion , we must look ahead and develop new capabilities for a new era . 
At a time when defense budgets are being slashed across the Alliance , this requires a new approach . 
By working together to maximize our assets and resources , we can do more with what we have . 
In Chicago , the Allies will commit to this approach as a long-term strategy for improving NATO &apos;s capabilities . 
Finally , partnerships will figure prominently on the agenda in Chicago . 
Over the past 20 years , NATO has created a network of security partnerships with countries around the world . 
Unlike Allies , partners are not covered by Article 5 , the North Atlantic Treaty &apos;s collective-defense clause . 
But transnational threats demand multinational solutions , and our partnerships help us to address common challenges . 
NATO holds regular consultations with all of our partners . 
And many of our partners bring valuable capabilities and expertise to our operations . 
I began by noting my personal identification with the bond between North America and Europe . 
But this attachment goes deeper than you think . 
Chicago has long been a home for many European immigrants . 
My own son lives in Illinois , not far from Chicago , with his wife and two children . 
Of my four grandchildren , two are European and two are American . 
When I think about reasons to preserve our transatlantic bond for future generations , I don &apos;t think about my security . 
I think about theirs . 
And that is the only reason I need . Read more from &quot; NATO Wakes Up &quot;
