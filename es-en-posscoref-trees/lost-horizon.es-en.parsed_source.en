Lost Horizon 
In the film &quot; Groundhog Day , &quot; Bill Murray plays a hapless TV weatherman who seems condemned to endlessly relive the same day over and over again , no matter what he does . 
The process of justifying long-term basic research in the life sciences often seems like just such a repetitive loop . 
The case is made , evidence is marshaled , some projects may be saved , but the next morning we find that policies and initiatives continue their inexorable march toward goals that are short-term and practical . 
Not that there &apos;s anything wrong with it ! 
The irony is that with federal and private funding of science at an all-time high , and with a record number of researchers working at laboratory benches , there is a narrowing of research activities and a shortening of the time horizon . 
Back in the 1970s , when life science research was a relatively small enterprise by today &apos;s standards , the renowned cardiologist Julius Comroe made the case for basic research to the US Congress in the form of an unbiased statistical survey of medical breakthroughs . 
He took 10 major medical advances of the previous three decades , agreed upon by a panel of 70 clinicians and an equal number of scientists , engineers and administrators . 
The advances included heart surgery , drug treatment of high blood pressure , chemotherapy for cancer , and prevention of polio . 
Comroe traced the origins of these advances back to the breakthrough discoveries that made them possible . 
After sifting through 2,500 published research reports , they identified 529 &quot; key &quot; papers , of which nearly two-thirds were basic in nature - defined as &quot; research to determine mechanisms by which living organisms function . &quot; 
Their survey stands as solid scientific evidence in favor of basic research in life sciences . 
There is no reason to believe that this fundamental truth has changed since then . 
Why ? 
The answer lies in the nature of scientific mystery . 
If it is a mystery , we cannot know what the answer will be ahead of time , nor where that answer will come . 
Roentgen undertook experiments with X-rays in order to study the structure of the atom and found , to everyone &apos;s surprise , that X-rays also made living tissue transparent . 
The Human Genome Project is often cited as an example of foresight and investment in the future . 
In one sense it does represent an exception , but in another , it is akin to the Apollo space program as a one-time , massive investment for one specific , long-range goal . 
It is also credited , however , as an advanced technology that makes old-time approaches obsolete . 
A recent scientific report belies this notion . 
Last month , the Icelandic biotech company , deCODE Genetics , Inc . , published a map of the human genome . 
Its findings are based on applying traditional gene mapping strategies to humans , making use of Iceland &apos;s unique historical circumstances of having a relatively isolated population , derived from a small founder group , with little immigration and extensive genealogical records . 
Their report contains substantial corrections of the genome map generated a year earlier by the high tech DNA sequencing efforts of Celera Genomics , Inc. and a large public consortium of labs . 
The Icelandic gene map would not have been possible but for the ground-breaking work that generated the first gene map in the fruit fly Drosophila 90 years ago . 
Today , deCODE followed essentially the same gene-mapping approach worked out in the fruit fly , one which could never have been discovered if humans were the only subjects studied . 
Back when Comroe made his study of medical advances , he was directing his arguments to the public and their elected representatives . 
There was scant need to convince scientists of the importance of basic research . 
One unforeseen consequence of the hefty budgets now devoted to science is that such vast funds have increased the pressure for practical outcomes . 
The more money , the greater the need to show usable results . 
So there is a growing incentive to medical-ize , practical-ize and commercialize the research projects because these have greater currency - they get picked up by the news media and get preferential treatment in the initiatives that emanate from funding agencies . 
They have a shorter apparent time horizon , and the path towards their goal is apparently clear . 
One may dispute whether these appearances have any underlying reality , but whether they do or not , this defines the best strategy to get money . 
Areas of research as esoteric and fundamental as fruit fly genetics have even succumbed . 
Genetic studies of the fruit fly have produced many breakthrough discoveries , three of which earned Nobel prizes - one early on for the discovery that genes are carried by chromosomes , another subsequently for the discovery that mutations can be produced by X-rays , and a third more recently for discovery of the genes underlying formation of the embryonic body plan . 
None was motivated by a wish for practicality ; all three had enormous practical and medical payback . 
Today &apos;s climate has spawned fruit fly research projects on cocaine and alcohol abuse , degenerative aging , and disease models for Parkinson &apos;s and Alzheimer &apos;s . 
Such efforts are not intrinsically bad , but a problem arises if the climate begins to obscure the value of the research defined by Comroe as aimed at &quot; mechanisms by which living organisms function . &quot; 
Despite record levels of money and personnel , the playing field for asking basic questions has shrunk . 
It is essential that we remember where and how our greatest advances arose . 
It requires only that we have faith in the notion that what worked in the past will continue to work in the future . 
Otherwise , we may find ourselves falling victim to the ultimate irony of spending more and more money with less and less of value to show for it .
