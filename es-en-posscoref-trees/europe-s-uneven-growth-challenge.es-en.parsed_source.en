Europe &apos;s Uneven Growth Challenge 
A year ago , the euro zone &apos;s most important challenge was anemic economic growth . 
But 2006 turned out to be a good year for growth in Europe , as surprising strength in exports sparked unexpected increases in domestic demand . 
Germany , the euro zone &apos;s biggest economy , had a particularly dramatic turnaround , with annual GDP up by 2.7 % in 2006 , the highest rate since 2000 . 
Not only has German resurgence raised overall growth in Europe , but it has also made growth less evenly balanced throughout the euro zone . 
This is because Germany is growing faster than the other large economies , France and Italy . 
Germany accomplished this feat by dramatically re-structuring its corporate sector . 
From 2001 to 2005 , there was a &quot; silent revolution &quot; in Germany . 
While observers and commentators focused on the economy &apos;s slow overall growth , behind the scenes , largely unnoticed , important changes were taking place . 
Without fanfare , German workers accepted longer hours without increases in pay . 
This allowed Germany to improve its competitive position in world markets vis-Ã -vis the other large euro-zone economies , where there were no productivity revolutions , silent or otherwise . 
It took some time for the silent revolution to show concrete results . 
But by 2006 , both German exports and GDP were growing faster than in France and Italy . 
Before the introduction of the euro , the reform gap between Germany and its larger neighbors would have been no problem for Europe . 
The currencies of the reform laggards would have depreciated against that of Germany , and there might have been a supportive cut in interest rates as well . 
This is no longer possible . 
Superior German economic performance has bid up the euro and European interest rates to levels that , while comfortable for the Germans , put pressure on the euro zone &apos;s laggards . 
The appropriate level of the euro for the Germans is too high for the French and Italians . 
The right interest rate for the French and Italians is too low for the Germans . 
For reform laggards like France , Italy , and Portugal , currency union with an increasingly competitive Germany is forcing an unwelcome choice between revving up their own reforms and permanent stagnation . 
This is no easy choice . 
Even with political will , revving up the reform process is a difficult task and takes time . 
Indeed , it took a motivated Germany four to five years to do it . 
But the prospect of permanent stagnation for countries like France , Italy , and Portugal is unacceptable . 
Chronic stagnation is too high a price to pay for adopting the euro . 
Naturally , politicians are reluctant to face up to choices between the unacceptable ( permanent stagnation ) , the unthinkable ( leaving the euro ) , and the hard-to-do ( reform ) . 
So they are taking refuge in fantasy . 
In France , for example , all current presidential candidates hold out the unrealistic prospect of staying in the currency union but watering down the independence of the European Central Bank and its price stability mandate , increasing &quot; consultation &quot; between governments and the ECB , and manipulating the euro to France &apos;s advantage . 
This is pure escapism . 
Approval of fundamental changes in the currency union must be agreed by all members , and so will not be forthcoming . 
Nor will ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet be intimidated by French pressure to pursue a softer monetary policy . 
Trichet is a tough guy with a long history of standing up to the French politicians . 
They couldn &apos;t make him bend when , as Governor , he successfully defended the independence of the Bank of France , and they won &apos;t make him bend now . 
At the January meeting of the ECB &apos;s Governing Council , for example , Trichet virtually pre-announced that European interest rates would be increased in March just before the April French elections . 
The ECB President made it clear he will do his duty whatever the political pressure . 
The defining factor in Trichet &apos;s sense of duty is the Maastricht Treaty , which clearly states the prime objective of Europe &apos;s central bank to be the promotion of price stability . 
Some in France - and not just the left - want to change this . 
One idea making the rounds is for the European Parliament to define the ECB &apos;s objectives , on the basis that it is democratically elected - as if the Maastricht Treaty did not result from a democratic process . 
This high-handed attempt to highjack the ECB and make it a servant of the European Parliament would mean chronically low European interest rates and a depreciated euro . 
France would be off the reform hook , of course , but at the expense of Germany , which would face unwanted inflationary pressures . 
This proposal illustrates how the reform gap , and the unbalanced growth that results from it , can debilitate the European fabric by setting one partner against the other . 
To protect European cohesion as well as improve their own economic situation , France and Italy must reform at a faster pace than Germany rather than just waiting for Germany to slow down . 
The hard-to-do is preferable to the unacceptable and the unthinkable . 
Still , there is little indication so far that the two reform laggards are up to the challenge .
