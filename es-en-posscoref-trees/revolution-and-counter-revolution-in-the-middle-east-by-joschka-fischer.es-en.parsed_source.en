The Struggle for Middle East Mastery 
BERLIN - The last illusions about what was called , until recently , the &quot; Arab Spring &quot; may have vanished . 
Egypt &apos;s military coup has made the simple , depressing alternatives for the country &apos;s future crystal clear : The question is no longer one of democracy versus dictatorship , but rather one of ( Islamist ) revolution versus ( military ) counter-revolution - dictatorship or dictatorship . 
This applies not only to Egypt , but to almost all of the wider Middle East . 
And , because both sides have opted for armed struggle , the outcome will be civil war , regardless of what well-intentioned European Union foreign ministers decide in Brussels . 
The Islamists cannot win militarily , just as the generals cannot win politically , which all but ensures the return of dictatorship , significant violence , and a series of humanitarian disasters . 
For both sides , full mastery and control is the only option , though neither has even a rudimentary understanding of how to modernize the economy and society . 
So , whichever side gains the upper hand , authoritarianism and economic stagnation will prevail once again . 
In Egypt , the army will be the victor , at least in the medium term . 
With the support of old elites , the urban middle class , and religious minorities , Egypt &apos;s military leaders have clearly adopted an all-or-nothing strategy . 
Moreover , financial support from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states has made the army impervious to outside pressure . 
Thus , Egypt is reenacting the Algerian scenario . 
In 1992 , with the Islamic Salvation Front poised to win Algeria &apos;s general election , the country &apos;s military staged a coup and immediately canceled the election &apos;s second round . 
In the subsequent eight-year civil war , waged with appalling brutality by both sides , up to 200,000 people lost their lives . 
Military rule in Algeria continues de facto to this day . 
But , with the role of political Islam still unanswered , none of the country &apos;s fundamental problems has been addressed seriously , and its leaders have been unable to take advantage of promising opportunities ( for example , in contrast to Egypt , Algeria has large oil and gas reserves ) . 
In Egypt , the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s older generation is accustomed to prison and life underground , but there are many reasons to believe that its younger adherents will respond with terror and violence . 
Egypt , Syria , Yemen , Tunisia , and soon perhaps other countries in the region will serve as fertile grounds for a new , more militarily oriented Al Qaeda , which will become a more powerful factor in the Middle East &apos;s cacophony of interests and ideologies . 
The West in general , and the United States in particular , has little influence or real leverage . 
So it will complain , threaten , and deplore the horrors to come , but ultimately will follow its interests , not its principles . 
For example , Egypt , with its control of the Suez Canal and its cold peace with Israel , is too important strategically to be simply abandoned . 
Taken in isolation , the Egyptian situation is bad enough ; but it is by no means a unique case . 
Rather , it is part of a regional drama characterized primarily by a massive loss of order . 
The US-backed order in the Middle East is breaking down , yet no new order is emerging . 
Instead , there is only a spreading chaos that threatens to reach far beyond the region &apos;s borders . 
Following the spectacular failure of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney , with their neoconservative go-it-alone illusions , the US is no longer willing or able to shoulder the burden of being the last force for order in the Middle East . 
Having overstretched its forces in Afghanistan and Iraq , and facing economic retrenchment at home , the US is withdrawing , and there is no other power to take its place . 
Withdrawal is one of the riskiest military maneuvers , because it can easily degenerate into panicky retreat and chaos . 
With the upcoming withdrawal of the US and NATO from Afghanistan , the potential for turmoil in the region between North Africa and the Hindu Kush will increase significantly on its eastern edge . 
What we can learn today from the prolonged crisis in the Middle East is that regional powers are increasingly trying to replace the US as a force for order . 
This , too , will fuel chaos , because none of these powers is strong enough to shoulder the American burden . 
Moreover , the Sunni-Shia divide frequently leads to contradictory policies . 
In Egypt , for example , Saudi Arabia is supporting the military against the Muslim Brotherhood , whereas in Syria the Saudis are backing Salafists against the military , which receives support from Saudi Arabia &apos;s main enemies , Shia Iran and its Lebanese proxy , Hezbollah . 
But the region &apos;s struggle for power and its sectarian-ideological antagonisms also create an opportunity for cooperation once scarcely thought possible . 
Seen from this perspective , any US-Iranian talks over the nuclear issue in the wake of Hassan Rouhani &apos;s victory in Iran &apos;s presidential election could have much broader significance . 
In Egypt , the military counter-revolution will prevail , but the Islamist revolution eventually will return as long as its causes have not been eliminated . 
So , when the Islamist revolution does return , it is likely to be even more powerful and violent . 
A similar dynamic is evident in European history , particularly in the revolutions and counter-revolutions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . 
Indeed , the legacy of that dynamic was fully overcome in Europe only two decades ago . 
Now it seems to be recurring , largely unchanged , in the Middle East .
