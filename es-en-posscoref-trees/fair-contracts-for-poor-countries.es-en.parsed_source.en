Fair Contracts for Poor Countries 
A number of countries in Latin America , Africa , Eastern Europe , and elsewhere are abrogating or renegotiating contracts with multinational enterprises ( MNEs ) , and others are likely to follow suit . 
The costs can be high . 
Governments may get better terms , but they may also become embroiled in international investment disputes and discourage other investors . 
For companies , renegotiations mean uncertainty and possible interruptions of production and revenue . 
Significant shifts in power ( typically as a result of changes in commodity prices ) and ideology , or changes in the economics of projects , can lead to renegotiations , especially when it comes to large investments in natural resources and infrastructure . 
But often the reason is that the host country considers a contract to be unfair . 
While &quot; fairness &quot; may well be in the eyes of the beholder , in some cases , the host country may not have had the expertise required to negotiate the best possible deal - a frequent situation when MNEs negotiate with the least developed countries ( the world &apos;s 50 poorest countries , most of them in sub-Saharan Africa ) . 
Mittal &apos;s 2005 deal with Liberia ( renegotiated last year ) and various contracts with Congo probably fall at least partly into this category , as do some deals in ex-Soviet countries . 
Suppose a $ 500 million petroleum or copper contract needs to be negotiated . 
This will most likely involve a leading MNE , which can field a negotiating team that includes world-class lawyers , geologists , and financial analysts who understand , for example , the trade-offs between taxes and royalties and can put them in appropriate language . 
The host country , on the other hand , simply cannot match such a team . 
Perhaps it does not even know what to ask for . 
The resulting contract is all the more problematic because it is likely to involve one of the host country &apos;s few important resources , which can generate more predictable ( and probably higher ) revenues than official development assistance - and over a long period of time . 
So , even without corruption , it is not surprising when a future government demands that the contract be renegotiated . 
Clearly , the playing field with MNEs should be leveled . 
In theory , the host country could hire its own international experts to assist it in negotiations . 
But poor countries typically lack the funds needed to pay such a team &apos;s fees . 
Nor do the World Bank and regional development banks have the in-house expertise - or , as a rule , the funds - to provide technical assistance . 
But what if MNEs provided the funds ? 
Obviously , MNEs want the best possible deal for themselves ; but they also want durable contracts that won &apos;t be repudiated by the next government . 
So they have an interest in negotiating a fair deal , and one that is 
But , even if a company embraces this approach , problems abound . 
How can it be implemented without looking like bribery ( in case the company gives the funds directly to the government ) ? 
And how can companies prevent some of the funds from being misused ( say , if the government hires a third-rate team ) ? 
Here is a proposal : an Investment Contract Aid Facility ( ICAF ) under the umbrella of a well-respected organization . 
The ICAF would function like an escrow account into which the firm pays the funds required for the host country to hire a negotiating team . 
The escrow account manager then invites the country to select a team , suggesting what skills are required and perhaps even providing a roster of experts . 
The country would be free to choose its own team , but the escrow account manager , aided by an international advisory board of expert volunteers , would need to agree that it is , in fact , world-class . 
One could even include a capacity-building element by adding to the team one or two local negotiators . 
The result should be a contract that is as fair as possible under the given circumstances - and perceived as such . 
It would be enough for a handful of CEOs and prime ministers to say that they are prepared to consider using such a Facility on a case-by case basis . 
While this would not end the abrogation or renegotiation of contracts , it would eliminate one important reason them , benefiting countries and companies alike .
