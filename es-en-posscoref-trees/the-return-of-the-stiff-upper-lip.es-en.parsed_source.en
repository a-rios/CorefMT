The Return of the Stiff Upper Lip 
LONDON - Normally , British politics is a ferocious sport . 
Its parliamentary debates are often pugilistic and personal . 
The British media have been described as &quot; feral &quot; ( a word used by Tony Blair , among others ) . 
The questions asked of politicians by journalists are often so aggressive or implicitly insulting that one wonders why their recipients don &apos;t walk out of interviews in a huff , or wither on the spot from humiliation . 
But nothing has been normal in Britain of late . 
For one thing , there is the new coalition government - a rarity unseen since the end of World War II . 
Then , there are the reactions to the new government , which have been marked by a temperateness of tone that is highly unusual - and all the more surprising , given that David Cameron , the new prime minister , has not exactly been the bearer of good news . 
Cameron &apos;s central proposition is that Britain is in a state of &quot; crisis , &quot; and that getting through it will require fortitude and patience . 
In a major speech , he warned that there is &quot; pain &quot; ahead , and that it will be felt by everyone , as severe spending cuts will be required to bring down Britain &apos;s massive fiscal deficit . 
Ordinarily , such pronouncements would provoke outcries of dismay , and of real or pretended indignation . 
What has happened ? 
Perhaps an alliance between Conservatives and Liberals - the two parties ostensibly farthest apart in their views - confounded everyone out of their certainties . 
This in itself may be no bad thing . 
For one thing , the coalition exposes an undercurrent in British political life that has coexisted - almost furtively - with heated rhetoric : convergence among the main parties towards a kind of centrist synthesis on most of the big issues . 
In a sense , the Conservative-Liberal coalition represents a culmination of this trend . 
The policies and positions articulated by the new government suggest not so much the once vaunted Third Way ( a slogan for the age of prosperity ) as a carefully calibrated Middle Way . 
It is clear , for example , that the sacred cows of public services and social benefits - among the most extensive in the world - will not remain untouched . 
Both will be subject to cuts . 
In addition , Cameron is proposing other reforms , such as requiring people , after several years &quot; unemployment , to accept a job offer , even if it is not the applicant &apos;s preference . 
This may help break the demoralizing cycle of unemployment and alienation . 
There will also be new restraints on immigration . 
These come , however , after a vast influx of legal and illegal immigrants . 
At the other end of the economic spectrum , banking practices will - one hopes - be better regulated , following a prolonged period of stunning financial irresponsibility . 
Clearly , however , nationalization , or a state-managed economy , is not in the cards . 
For all the discomforts that may lie ahead , Britain is not about to enter an age of brutal austerity . 
Instead , what the coalition seems to be proposing is a sort of correction , a retrenchment from various excesses and dysfunctions to something more restrained and disciplined . 
And it seems that this agenda has captured a deep , if mostly unspoken vein of popular feeling - a consensus that something has been amiss in &quot; broken Britain , &quot; and that something needs to be done about it . 
Now that the problem has been articulated , one can sense not only general agreement , but almost palpable relief . 
Perhaps the age of irresponsibility is over ; perhaps we no longer have to shop until we drop ; perhaps the compact between the individual and the government , in which both are understood to have obligations as well as rights , can be restored ; perhaps the state will cease to treat its citizens like maladjusted adolescents , of whom nothing much can be demanded and to whom everything is permitted . 
Instead of polemical mudslinging , words like &quot; realism , &quot; &quot; necessity , &quot; and &quot; practicality &quot; have again entered the public domain . 
The ubiquitous sense of entitlement , accompanied by automatic skepticism about all things political , seems to have been replaced by a recognition that some problems are not susceptible to simple left-right explanations or solutions ; that the government is neither omnipotent nor always ill-intentioned ; and that there are limits to the prosperity that politics can provide . 
The tone of stern warning has recently been adopted by other European leaders . 
There is a challenge to meet , a reason to pull together . 
It is difficult to know how long this sentiment of solidarity will last . 
Politics abhors equilibrium as much as nature abhors a vacuum ; and undoubtedly , tensions within the coalition , as well as outside it , will surface . 
Still , possibly the British mood portends a wider change of climate for Western liberal democracies , and the onset of a new , less indulgent era . 
For now , the British upper lip seems to have regained some of its stiffness . 
One hopes that this will last long enough for British society to regain its stability and its much-needed vigor .
