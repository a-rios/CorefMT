JFK Reconsidered 
CAMBRIDGE - November 22 will mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy . 
For people alive at the time , it was one of those events that are so shocking that you remember where you were when you heard the news . 
I was getting off a train in Nairobi when I saw the dramatic headline . 
Kennedy was only 46 when he was killed in Dallas by Lee Harvey Oswald , a disgruntled former Marine who had defected to the Soviet Union . 
Though his life had been plagued by illness , Kennedy projected an image of youth and vigor that added to the drama and poignancy of his death . 
Martyrdom led many Americans to elevate Kennedy to the ranks of great presidents like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln ; but historians have been more restrained in their evaluations . 
Critics point to his sometimes reckless sexual behavior ; to his scant legislative record ; and to his failure to match words with deeds . 
While Kennedy spoke about civil rights , tax cuts , and reducing poverty , it was his successor , Lyndon Johnson , who used Kennedy &apos;s martyrdom and his own far more impressive political skills to pass historic legislation in these areas . 
A 2009 poll of 65 American presidential scholars rated JFK as the sixth most important president , while a recent survey of British experts on American politics put Kennedy in 15th place . 
Those are impressive rankings for a president who was in office for less than three years , but what did Kennedy really accomplish and how might history have been different if he had survived ? 
In my book Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era , I divide presidents into two categories : those who are transformational in their objectives , pursuing large visions related to major changes ; and transactional leaders , who focus more on &quot; operational &quot; issues - ensuring that the metaphorical trains run on time ( and stay on the tracks ) . 
Because he was an activist and a great communicator with an inspirational style , Kennedy appeared to be a transformational president . 
He campaigned in 1960 on a promise to &quot; get the country moving again . &quot; 
Kennedy &apos;s inaugural address appealed to sacrifice ( &quot; Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country &quot; ) . 
He established programs like the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress with Latin America , and he set the United States on a path to landing a man on the moon by the end of the 1960 &quot; s . 
But , despite his activism and rhetoric , Kennedy was a cautious rather than an ideological personality . 
As the presidential historian Fred Greenstein put it , &quot; Kennedy had little in the way of an overarching perspective . &quot; 
Rather than being critical of Kennedy for not living up to his rhetoric , we should be grateful that in critical situations , he was prudent and transactional rather than ideological and transformational . 
The most important achievement of Kennedy &apos;s brief presidency was to manage the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and defuse what was probably the riskiest episode since the dawn of the nuclear age . 
Kennedy certainly can be blamed for the bungled Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and the subsequent Operation Mongoose - the covert CIA effort against the Castro regime that convinced the Soviet Union that its ally was under threat . 
But Kennedy learned from his failure at the Bay of Pigs and created a careful process for managing the crisis that followed the Soviet Union &apos;s placement of nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba . 
Many of Kennedy &apos;s advisers , as well as US military leaders , urged an air strike and invasion , which we now know might have led Soviet field commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons . 
Instead , Kennedy played for time and kept his options open as he negotiated a stand-down with the Soviet leader , Nikita Khrushchev . 
Judging by Vice President Lyndon Johnson &apos;s hawkish comments at the time , the outcome might have been far worse if Kennedy had not been president . 
Moreover , Kennedy learned from the Cuban missile crisis as well ; on June 10 , 1963 , he gave a speech aimed at easing Cold War tensions . 
&quot; I speak of peace , therefore , as the necessary rational end of rational men , &quot; he said . 
While a presidential vision of peace was not new , Kennedy followed it up by negotiating the first nuclear arms-control agreement , the Limited Test Ban Treaty . 
The great unanswered question about Kennedy &apos;s presidency and how his assassination affected American foreign policy is what he would have done about the war in Vietnam . 
When Kennedy became President , the US had a few hundred advisers in South Vietnam ; he increased that number to 16,000 . 
Johnson eventually raised the number of US troops to more than 500,000 . 
Many Kennedy supporters claim that he would never have made such a mistake . 
But he had supported a coup to replace South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem and left Johnson a deteriorating situation and a group of advisers who counseled against withdrawal . 
Some fervent Kennedy supporters - for example , the historian Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. and Kennedy &apos;s speechwriter , Theodore Sorensen - have written that Kennedy planned to withdraw from Vietnam after he won re-election in 1964 , and claim that Kennedy told Senator Mike Mansfield that that was his plan . 
But skeptics point out that Kennedy always spoke publicly about the need to prevail in Vietnam . 
The question remains open . 
In my view , Kennedy was a good but not a great president . 
What made him good was not merely his ability to inspire others , but his prudence when it came to complex foreign-policy decisions . 
We are fortunate that he was more often transactional than transformational in foreign policy . 
We are unfortunate that we lost him after only a thousand days .
