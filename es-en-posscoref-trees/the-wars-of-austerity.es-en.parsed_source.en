The Wars of Austerity 
LONDON - I have become increasingly less hopeful about prospects for a rapid recovery from the global recession . 
Coordinated fiscal expansion ( $ 5 trillion ) by the world &apos;s leading governments arrested the downward slide , but failed to produce a healthy rebound . 
The current frustration is summed up by The Economist &apos;s recent cover headline : &quot; Grow , dammit , grow . &quot; 
There are two reasons to be pessimistic . 
The first reason is the premature withdrawal of the &quot; stimulus &quot; measures agreed upon by the G-20 in London in April 2009 . 
All the main countries are now committed to slashing their budget deficits . 
The second reason is that nothing has been done to address the problem of current-account imbalances . 
Indeed , the talk nowadays of currency wars leading to trade wars is reminiscent of the disastrous experience of the 1930 &quot; s . 
The problem of current-account imbalances is closely linked to the existence of a world savings glut . 
One part of the world , led by China , earns more than it spends , whereas another part , notably the United States , spends more than it earns . 
Provided the surplus countries invest in the deficit countries , these imbalances pose no macroeconomic problem . 
Indeed , this was the nineteenth-century pattern . 
A system of foreign investment , pivoting on London , channeled the savings of rich ( or surplus ) countries to the poor ( or deficit ) countries . 
Despite many financial crises and defaults , this creditor-debtor relationship worked , on the whole , to the benefit of both sides . 
Rich-country investors earned a higher rate of return than they would at home , and poor-country recipients raised the development finance they needed . 
There was no persistent tendency to deflation . 
The current system is superficially similar , but with one crucial difference : the flow of saving now goes from developing countries like China to rich countries like the US -that is , from countries where capital is scarce to countries where it is abundant . 
The global savings glut is the result of this perverse relationship . 
Unlike Great Britain in the nineteenth century , China does not view its surplus as an investment engine . 
It undertook reserve accumulation in the late 1990 &quot; s as a form of self-insurance against capital flight . 
Reserve accumulation was also a by-product of China &apos;s deliberate currency undervaluation to promote export-led growth strategy . 
The result is that China and other East Asian countries own a large and growing stock of US Treasury bills . 
Through financial intermediation , these government securities helped finance the western consumption and speculative boom that collapsed in 2008 . 
Cheap money in the West was the &quot; correct &quot; Keynesian response to the flood of saving from the East . 
But , because there were insufficient outlets for &quot; real &quot; investment in countries that already had all the capital they could use , cheap money proved to be a dysfunctional way of dealing with the problem of excess saving . 
The recession reinforced the pattern of poor countries lending to rich ones . 
With vigorous recovery in East Asia and stagnation in the West , global imbalances have grown . 
And , as former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently noted , &quot; US fixed capital investment has fallen far short of the level that history suggests should have occurred , given the dramatic surge in corporate profitability . &quot; 
In short , we are heading full steam ahead into the next collapse . 
There are two broad strategies for unraveling the linked problems of current-account and saving-investment imbalances . 
The first is to weaken China &apos;s incentive to accumulate reserves . 
In April 2009 , Zhou Xiaochuan , Governor of the People &apos;s Bank of China , proposed the creation of a &quot; super-sovereign reserve currency &quot; to remove the &quot; inherent risks &quot; of credit-based national reserve currencies . 
This new currency , to be developed from the International Monetary Fund &apos;s Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) , would in time entirely replace national reserve currencies . 
A &quot; substitution account , &quot; housed at the IMF , would enable countries to convert their existing reserve holdings into SDRs . 
The principle behind this is that collective insurance would be cheaper , and therefore less deflationary , than self-insurance . 
A reduced Chinese appetite for reserves would be reflected in an appreciation of its currency and a reduction in its trade surplus . 
This far-sighted Chinese proposal never left the drawing board . 
Instead , the US has brought intense pressure to bear on China to revalue the renminbi . 
The result is a war of words that could easily turn into something worse . 
The US accuses China of undervaluing its currency , while China blames loose US monetary policy for flooding emerging markets with US dollars . 
The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that would allow duties to be imposed on imports from countries , like China , that manipulate their currencies for trade advantage . 
Meanwhile , the dollar &apos;s depreciation in anticipation of further quantitative easing has caused East Asian central banks to step up their purchases of dollars and impose controls on capital inflows , in order to prevent their currencies from appreciating . 
As Asian countries try to keep capital out , the West moves towards protectionism . 
We can learn from the experience of the 1930 &quot; s . 
A rising tide lifts all boats ; a receding one ignites a Hobbesian war of each against all . 
This brings us back to the premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus . 
With aggregate demand depressed in Europe and the US , governments turn naturally to export markets to relieve unemployment at home . 
But all countries cannot simultaneously run trade surpluses . 
The attempt to achieve them is bound to lead to competitive currency depreciation and protectionism . 
As Keynes wisely remarked , &quot; If nations can learn to provide themselves with full employment by their domestic policy ... there would no longer be a pressing motive why one country need force its wares on another or repulse the offerings of its neighbor . &quot; 
Trade between countries &quot; would cease to be what it is , namely a desperate expedient to maintain employment at home by forcing sales on foreign markets and restricting purchases . &quot; 
It would become , instead , &quot; a willing and unimpeded exchange of goods and services in conditions of mutual advantage . &quot; 
In other words , today &apos;s turmoil over currencies and trade is a direct result of our failure to solve our employment problem .
