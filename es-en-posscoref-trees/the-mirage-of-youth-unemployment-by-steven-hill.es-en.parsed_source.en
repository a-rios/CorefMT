The Mirage of Youth Unemployment 
PARIS - Economists worldwide need better ways to measure economic activity . 
Relying on GDP growth rates to assess economic health , almost all of them missed the warning signs of the 2008 financial crisis , including an $ 8 trillion real-estate bubble in the United States , as well as property bubbles in Spain , Ireland , and the United Kingdom . 
Together with households , financial institutions , investors , and governments , economists were swept up in the financial euphoria that led to excessive risk-taking and severe over-leveraging of banks and households . 
Even the eurozone &apos;s macroeconomic imbalances largely went unnoticed . 
Unemployment estimates also are surprisingly misleading - a serious problem , considering that , together with GDP indicators , unemployment drives so much economic-policy debate . 
Outrageously high youth unemployment - supposedly near 50 % in Spain and Greece , and more than 20 % in the eurozone as a whole - makes headlines daily . 
The problem stems from how unemployment is measured : The adult unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals in the labor force . 
So if the labor force comprises 200 workers , and 20 are unemployed , the unemployment rate is 10 % . 
But the millions of young people who attend university or vocational training programs are not considered part of the labor force , because they are neither working nor looking for a job . 
In calculating youth unemployment , therefore , the same number of unemployed individuals is divided by a much smaller number , to reflect the smaller labor force , which makes the unemployment rate look a lot higher . 
In the example above , let us say that 150 of the 200 workers become full-time university students . 
Although the number of unemployed people remains at 20 , the unemployment rate quadruples , to 40 % . 
So the perverse result of this way of counting the unemployed is that the more young people who pursue additional education or training , the higher the youth unemployment rate rises . 
While standard measures exaggerate youth unemployment , they likely understate adult unemployment , because those who have given up their job search are not counted among the unemployed . 
As the Great Recession drives up the number of such &quot; discouraged workers , &quot; adult unemployment rates appear to fall - presenting a distorted picture of reality . 
Fortunately , there is a better methodology : The youth unemployment ratio - the number of unemployed youth relative to the total population aged 16-24 - is a far more meaningful indicator than the youth unemployment rate . 
Eurostat , the European Union &apos;s statistical agency , calculates youth unemployment using both methodologies , but only the flawed indicator is widely reported , despite major discrepancies . 
For example , Spain &apos;s 48.9 % youth unemployment rate implies significantly worse conditions for young people than its 19 % youth unemployment ratio . 
Likewise , Greece &apos;s rate is 49.3 % , but its ratio is only 13 % . 
To be sure , a youth unemployment ratio of 13 % or 19 % is not grounds for complacency . 
During the 2006 French student protests , France &apos;s 22 % youth unemployment rate appeared to compare unfavorably to rates of 11 % , 12 % , and 13 % in the United Kingdom , the US , and Germany , respectively . 
France simply had a higher percentage of young people who were full-time students . 
Failing to account for the millions of young people either attending university or in vocational training programs undermines the unemployment rate &apos;s credibility . 
Policymakers do , of course , need to address the problem of youth unemployment ; but they must also acknowledge that the problem is not as serious as the headlines indicate . 
Unfortunately , these distorted results have become conventional wisdom - even for respected economists like the Nobel laureate Paul Krugman , who recently invoked the flawed &quot; 50 % youth unemployment &quot; figure . 
Thus , four years after the crisis erupted , methods for measuring and assessing economic health remain alarmingly inadequate . 
As any pilot knows , flying without radar or accurate weather forecasts is likely to end in a crash .
