Taiwan &apos;s Journey From Troublemaker to Peacemaker 
OXFORD - Is the &quot; harmonious society &quot; that Chinese President Hu Jintao constantly proclaims being realized in China &apos;s relations with Taiwan ? 
Before Ma Ying-jeou became President of Taiwan ( officially known as the Republic of China ) in May 2008 , Taiwan was regularly portrayed in China as a &quot; troublemaker , &quot; and was the main cause of tension between China and the United States . 
Now Taiwan has become something of a diplomatic afterthought because it no longer makes trouble . 
At the US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue , indeed , Taiwan was barely mentioned , as North Korea , Iran , and the value of the renminbi claimed the most attention . 
It has always been unfair to demonize the Taiwanese merely for wanting what most people around the world take for granted : to uphold their basic human rights and way of life , including the right to decide through a democratic process their own future . 
China , however , rejects such sentimentality about self-determination . 
And , as a rising power , China is not a force that leaders , even democratic ones , dismiss lightly . 
For years , China &apos;s ruling Communist Party has maintained that Taiwan is a &quot; core national interest , &quot; despite the reality that Taiwan has existed and functioned as a virtual state for 60 years . 
China has long threatened to use force if the international community should formally recognize Taiwan &apos;s independence . 
But the atmosphere gradually changed in recent years , and the &quot; troublemaker &quot; label , applied under Ma &apos;s predecessor , President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) , has not been used for two years . 
Of course , Taiwan under President Ma still wants the same rights that it desired under Chen . 
But Ma has taken a different approach . 
He has eased tensions with China by focusing on what both sides can agree upon . 
China &apos;s leaders find his language inoffensive . 
And he has sought to forge closer trade and transport links . 
Ma &apos;s strategy suits China , whose leaders welcome being able to avoid confrontation with Taiwan , given their current focus on engineering their country &apos;s &quot; peaceful rise . &quot; 
Moreover , China does not wish to see the DPP and its aggressively pro-independence leaders return to power . 
When Ma &apos;s popularity fell dramatically as Taiwan &apos;s economy suffered from the global financial crisis , China &apos;s leaders worked with Ma to pre-empt just such an outcome . 
This has allowed Ma &apos;s administration to claim credit for improving relations with China . 
But the fundamental causes underlying the threat of a China-Taiwan war - and conflict between China and the US , which has long been committed to supporting Taiwan should China seek to determine its status unilaterally - have not been removed . 
The Chinese Communist Party remains committed to forcing Taiwan to accept the idea of ultimate &quot; reunification , &quot; while the Taiwanese remain determined to decide their own future . 
But each side &apos;s interests need not be mutually exclusive . 
The right to national self-determination does not imply an assertion of de jure independence . 
For example , acknowledgement of Scotland &apos;s right to choose independence has not resulted in Scotland leaving the United Kingdom . 
What people in Taiwan want is nothing more and nothing less than acknowledgement that they can decide their own future . 
Given China &apos;s deep distrust , it will never believe that a DPP president who insists on the Taiwanese people &apos;s right to determine their future will not secretly push for independence . 
But , since China knows that Ma is not advocating independence , they are able to countenance with greater equanimity his commitment to sustain the Republic of China on Taiwan . 
If ever there were an opportunity for China and Taiwan to find a way to ensure that future confrontations do not escalate and drag the US into a conflict , it is now . 
What Ma must do is forge a clearer consensus within Taiwan that the independence vs. unification issue is a phoney one . 
The real issue is whether both sides can acknowledge that Taiwan &apos;s people have the right to determine their future . 
China &apos;s leaders need to be persuaded that conceding this point does not imply letting Taiwan move towards de jure independence . 
This may require that the Taiwanese abandon their tendency to hold regular referenda to show that they enjoy this right . 
And the People &apos;s Republic will need to recognize that the best way to entice Taiwanese to embrace reunification is to make the proposition so attractive that they cannot resist . 
There is no need to set a timetable for this . 
As a rising superpower , China should feel confident that time is on its side . 
The whole world shares an interest in preventing disagreements between Taiwan and China from becoming a cause for military confrontation between the US and China . 
Ma has created the necessary conditions for deactivating the trigger . 
It is time for the rest of the world to support him in removing it forever , so that Taiwan will continue to fade as a global concern .
