Reason and the End of Poverty 
WASHINGTON , DC - The World Bank has set two new goals for itself : ending extreme and chronic poverty in the world by 2030 , and promoting shared prosperity , defined in terms of progress of the poorest 40 % of the population in each society . 
Now that the United Nations General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals has endorsed the Bank &apos;s anti-poverty target , debate about how to achieve it has revived an old question : Will the benefits of economic growth trickle down on their own , reaching all , or will we need targeted redistributive policies ? 
Many people remain in the growth-only camp only because of an error in deductive reasoning ; unlike committed ideologues , they can be weaned from their position . 
That is why the World Bank &apos;s second goal of promoting shared prosperity is important not only in itself , but as an essential complement to the goal of ending poverty . 
Recognizing that some &quot; frictional &quot; poverty will inevitably persist over the next two decades , the World Bank &apos;s formal target is to reduce the percentage of people living below the poverty line - defined as daily consumption of less than $ 1.25 ( in purchasing-power-parity terms ) per person - to less than 3 % . 
World Bank research predicts that if all countries grow at the same rates that they did over the past 20 years , with no change in income distribution , world poverty will fall to 7.7 % by 2030 , from 17.7 % in 2010 . 
If they grow faster , at the average rates recorded in the 2000 &quot; s , the poverty rate will fall to 5.5 % . 
These numbers suggest that growth alone is unlikely to get us to the 3 % target . 
One can argue that we should nonetheless rely on growth and simply adopt measures that encourage more of it . 
In a new paper , David Dollar , Tatjana Kleineberg , and Aart Kraay analyze empirically the relationship between growth and poverty . 
Their comprehensive study draws on high-quality survey data from 118 countries and reaches a clear conclusion : the bulk of poverty eradication that took place in recent decades was driven by economies &quot; overall income growth . 
More specifically , 77 % of the cross-country variation in the income growth of the poorest 40 % of the population reflects differences in average income growth . 
Findings like these lead many people to conclude that eradicating poverty requires us to rely on overall growth , and that direct government policy interventions have little merit . 
To see why , suppose that in 1930 an economist conducted an empirical study of what cured infectious diseases , and , analyzing masses of data from previous years , concluded that 98 % of all treatable illnesses were cured by non-antibiotic medicines - &quot; tradicines , &quot; which include all traditional medicines of various schools . 
This conclusion would most likely be valid , because the use of antibiotics before 1930 - just two years after Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin and years before it was fully workable as a cure - was rare and mostly inadvertent . 
But now suppose that the economist goes on to argue that , therefore , it would be silly to give patients penicillin , because we know that 98 % of all treatable diseases were cured by tradicines , and penicillin is not a tradicine . 
That is a wrong deduction , based on evidence that does not exist . 
What the economist &apos;s study in 1930 showed is that tradicines accounted for 98 % of the cases that were successfully treated . 
It does not show that penicillin does not work . 
This is a common mistake . 
We often hear assertions like , &quot; We must rely on the private sector to create jobs , because studies show that 90 % of past jobs were created by the private sector . &quot; 
If we accepted this reasoning , we would have to accept a Soviet researcher &apos;s assertion in the late 1980 &quot; s that we must rely on the state to create jobs , because 90 % of past jobs were created by the state . 
On job creation , there is both theory and evidence to support the conclusion that the private sector is the main driver of sustainable expansion ( which is not to deny that there may be scope for tweaking public policies to make the private sector more employment-friendly ) . 
Some of these policies already exist ; some have to be crafted - the antibiotics of our time . 
In India , the government has tried for decades to get cheap food to the poor . 
Cost-benefit analysis has led many to declare it a failed policy . 
Around 45 % of food grain leaks out and disappears in this process . 
This means that the program &apos;s leaks need to be repaired , not that the entire scheme should be abandoned . 
Obviously , when the poor have more ( and healthier ) food , their nutrition improves ; when better-nourished people go to school , they become more productive ; the same is true of health services . 
Overall economic growth is important , but the poor should not have to wait until its benefits trickle down to them ; with the right anti-poverty policies , governments can encourage trickle-up growth as well .
