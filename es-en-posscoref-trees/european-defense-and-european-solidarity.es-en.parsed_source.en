European Defense and European Solidarity 
PRAGUE - Perhaps it is the experience of a man who endured forty years of Communist rule , and the Nazi Occupation before that . 
Maybe it is the experience of inhabiting a country in the center of Europe , a place which has for centuries been a crossroads of Europe &apos;s spiritual currents , geopolitical interests , and confrontations . 
Perhaps all these factors , combined , led me to the conviction that Europe is one political entity whose security is indivisible . 
The idea that there could forever be two Europes - one democratic , stable , prosperous and integrated ; one less democratic , less stable , less prosperous and isolated - is mistaken . 
It is as if one part of a room could be heated and the other kept cold . 
There is only one Europe , despite its diversity . 
Any weighty occurrence provokes repercussions across the continent . 
If Europe is to become one , if the European Union is to take in the new postcommunist democracies - which is in the interest of all Europe - a number of vital tasks must be undertaken , within the new democracies , as well as , in the European and Atlantic communities . 
To begin , Europe must foster community in the postcommunist countries by restoring civil society . 
For a living society cannot be restructured from above . 
Thus Europe must help its new democracies to become an organic part of a shared Continental commitment to a deepening and advancement of civil society . 
The more diverse and interconnected European civic structures become , the better equipped the new democracies will be for membership in the EU and the more stable they will be as States . 
To achieve this , Europe must encourage the new democracies to transfer various tasks of solidarity to self-governing bodies and non-profit or public service organizations . 
The lower the level of redistribution , the more transparent and more economical it will be ; and , the better it will satisfy those social needs which central authorities cannot discern . 
Social solidarity will become more authentic if closely linked with concrete people or their associations . 
Authentic solidarity amongst people , social groups , settlements and regions is also the surest background for those forms of solidarity that only States can implement . 
A bitter chapter in modern European history was the policy of appeasement with its renunciation of European solidarity , leading to the capitulation of Munich . 
This experience still carries a strong appeal for vigilance . 
Evil must be confronted as soon as it emerges , but it is not enough if governments act . 
For government policies grow from the sentiments of civil society , from the people . 
Concern for security , indeed , is a manifestation of societal solidarity . 
The EU is working intensively on a new concept of its security policy . 
It should be marked by a capacity to decide quickly and speedily translate joint decisions into action - reforms recent events in Yugoslavia exposed as necessary . 
NATO &apos;s intervention last year showed that respect for human life and human liberty , and considerations of pan-European security , can necessitate intervention outside the EU &apos;s borders . 
The stronger the mandate for such action , the better . 
Unfortunately , there may be situations in which a UN mandate may not come , although intervention is in the interest of many people ; of all Europe ; indeed , of human civilization . 
Until recently , Europe was ill-prepared for this alternative . 
It is more prepared now , at least psychologically . 
This psychological preparedness should be utilized to advance Europe &apos;s material and technical preparedness . 
But more needs doing in the field of preventive security , and to make that security reflect the values of Europe &apos;s wider civil society . 
Tens of thousands of human lives and immense material could have been saved in Kosovo , Bosnia / Herzegovina , as well as other parts of former Yugoslavia , had the international community acted at the beginning of conflict . 
Despite warnings about impending horrors , action was timid . 
Those failures arose from a consideration of various particular domestic interests , as well as a lack of readiness to take risks for a good cause . 
Indeed , without American energy , the international community would still be watching the horrors of Kosovo . 
Europe cannot remain forever dependent on the US , especially over European problems . 
It must be capable of agreeing on solutions of its own . 
It is unthinkable that the EU can stand as a respected part of the global order if it proves unable to agree on ways of protecting human rights , not only in its territory , but in areas that may one day be joined to it . 
Such EU enlargement is fathomable only if it progresses hand-in-hand with bold reform of EU institutions . 
I trust that the Intergovernmental Conference on institutional reform will produce viable proposals to move the Union forward . 
But I see this as the beginning of a process which may take decades , and which should be guided by a lasting endeavor to speed up EU decision-making , making it more transparent . 
One issue connected with institutional reform is the question of how to give smaller States a certainty that they will not be simply outvoted by larger ones , yet pay due regard to the size of these individual States . 
A possibility here is to establish a second chamber of the European Parliament with members not elected by direct ballot , but by the parliaments of member States from among their ranks . 
Thus , the EU &apos;s first chamber - ie , its present Parliament - would mirror the size of individual member States ; its second chamber , with the same number of representatives from every State , would enhance equality . 
Sooner or later these changes will require that the EU possess a clear , understandable Constitution - a text all European children could learn . 
Such a Constitution needs two parts . 
Part One would lay down the rights and duties of European citizens as well as of States ; the underlying values of a united Europe ; and the meaning and objectives of integration . 
Part Two would describe the EU &apos;s key institutions ; their principal powers and the relations between them . 
Such a basic law would not automatically mean transformation of today &apos;s union into the federal supra-state feared by Eurosceptics . 
It would , however , make it easier for citizens in an integrating Europe to recognize what the EU stands for ; to understand it better and see its connections to their lives ; and , consequently , to identify with it .
