A Crisis of Trust 
LONDON - Public trust in financial institutions , and in the authorities that are supposed to regulate them , was an early casualty of the financial crisis . 
That is hardly surprising , as previously revered firms revealed that they did not fully understand the very instruments they dealt in or the risks they assumed . 
It is difficult not to take some private pleasure in this comeuppance for the Masters of the Universe . 
But , unfortunately , if this loss of trust persists , it could be costly for us all . 
As Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked , &quot; Our distrust is very expensive . &quot; 
The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow made the point in economic terms almost 40 years ago : &quot; It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence . &quot; 
Indeed , much economic research has demonstrated a powerful relationship between the level of trust in a community and its aggregate economic performance . 
Without mutual trust , economic activity is severely constrained . 
Even within Europe , there is powerful evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment , particularly through venture capital investment , and are prepared to use more flexible contracts , which are also beneficial for growth and investment . 
So if it is true that trust in financial institutions - and in the governments that oversee them - has been damaged by the crisis , we should care a lot , and we should be devising responses which seek to rebuild that trust . 
In fact , the evidence for a crisis of trust is rather difficult to interpret . 
In the United Kingdom , recent survey results are ambiguous . 
Surveys promoted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not diminished much , and that people continue to trust them even more than they do the National Health Service or the BBC . 
Surveys promoted by the BBC tend to show the reverse . 
Banks quote statistics to show that they are more trusted than supermarkets , whereas supermarkets cite evidence that the opposite is true , and are expanding into financial services in the belief that the public will trust them more than they trust the banks , which have had to be expensively bailed out by the government . 
The market will prove one side right before too long . 
In the United States , there is now a more systematic , independent survey promoted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business . 
Their financial trust index , based on a large-scale survey of financial decision-makers in American households , did show a sharp fall in trust in late 2008 and early 2009 , following the collapse of Lehman Brothers . 
That fall in confidence affected banks , the stock market , and the government and its regulators . 
Furthermore , the survey showed that declining trust was strongly correlated with financial behavior . 
In other words , if your trust in the market and in the way it is regulated fell sharply , you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks . 
So falling trust had real economic consequences . 
Fortunately , the latest survey , published in July this year , shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover , and quite sharply . 
There is also a little more confidence in the government &apos;s response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year . 
The latter point , which no doubt reflects the Obama administration &apos;s attempts to reform the dysfunctional system it inherited , is particularly important , as the sharpest declines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government &apos;s ability to regulate . 
It would seem that rebuilding confidence in the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission is economically more important than rebuilding trust in Citibank or AIG . 
Continuing disputes in Congress about the precise details of reform could , therefore , have an economic cost if a perception that the system will not be overhauled gains ground . 
All these data are at an aggregate level and reflect average views among voters and investors . 
Yet we also know that individual views are remarkably heterogeneous . 
Some people are very trusting of others , and of the firms and institutions with which they do business . 
Others are congenitally distrustful . 
Researchers at the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between trust and individuals &quot; income . 
A pan-European opinion survey , which has been carried out for many years , allows us to relate the two . 
It asks simple but powerful questions about how far individuals are inclined to trust those with whom they deal . 
The data show , intriguingly , that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes . 
Is that just because low-income people feel that life is unfair and therefore distrust those around them ? 
It would seem not , as it is also true that very trusting people also have lower incomes than the average . 
In other words , if you diverge markedly from society &apos;s average level of trust , you are likely to lose out , either because you are so distrustful of others that you miss out on opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial exchange , or because you are so trusting that you leave yourself open to being cheated and abused . 
When anyone I don &apos;t know says &quot; trust me &quot; - an irritating conversational tic - I usually close my wallet . 
Perhaps most academics , who are at the lower end of the skill and qualification-adjusted income scale , do the same . 
Maybe we should trust each other more - but not too much .
