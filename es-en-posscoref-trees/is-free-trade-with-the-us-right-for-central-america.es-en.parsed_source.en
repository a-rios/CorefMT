Is Free Trade With the US Right for Central America ? 
Ronald Reagan &apos;s death forced many people to confront once again the legacy of Central America &apos;s brutal wars in Guatemala , El Salvador , and Nicaragua of two decades ago . 
That the region &apos;s bloody history is truly behind it seems to have been confirmed by the recent signing of the Central American Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) with the United States . 
The symbolism of that treaty promises much , not least the idea that civil wars and US interventions may be things of the past . 
But the details of the treaty offer little comfort to a region that is still recovering from the economic devastation wrought by those wars . 
Paramount to CAFTA is a concern about the extent to which Central American countries will liberalize their economies . 
But more critical is whether the agreement will make for healthier economies . 
Although CAFTA represents an important opportunity in the region &apos;s quest to expand its access to the US market , it is unclear whether the new rules will strengthen or weaken Central American producers . 
Under CAFTA , 80 % of US exports will be duty-free as soon as the treaty is ratified , and all tariffs will expire in 15 years . 
Until recently , the region maintained a trade surplus with the US , but with liberalization , the region will increase imports of more affordable goods , thereby turning the surplus into a deficit . 
Consider Mexico &apos;s trade balance with the US since the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) came into effect . 
In the years between 1995 and 2002 , Mexico &apos;s annual trade deficit with the US increased to $ 1 billion . 
Moreover , trade in agricultural products will benefit US exporters more than Central American farmers . 
The US , for example , agreed to sugar imports that equal 1 % of the total US market . 
That figure can grow only to 1.4 % over the next 15 years . 
At the same time , the agreement eliminates most import tariffs for commodities like rice , yellow corn , or dairy products . 
This will force small and medium producers to become more competitive , but they must do so on an uneven playing field . 
Unlike their counterparts in the US , Central American producers lack access to the capital and technology needed for them to expand and innovate . 
So , instead of improving their competitiveness , the agreement is likely to increase the number of displaced workers and producers . 
For a glimpse at the future , look at what has happened to Mexican corn farmers since NAFTA . 
Central American textiles were also caught in a CAFTA snag . 
The US textile lobby insisted that knit fabrics exported north come from Central America . 
The trouble is that Central America relies on third countries for knit fabrics . 
Finally , CAFTA fails to address labor issues in any significant way . 
The agreement only stresses that labor rights are to be respected , highlighting that a party to the agreement &quot; shall not fail to effectively enforce its labor laws , through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction , in a manner affecting trade between the Parties . &quot; 
In a region with weak enforcement and few mechanisms for redress , protection restricted to prevailing labor standards amounts to no protection at all . 
So why did Central America &apos;s leaders sign the agreement ? 
The region &apos;s economies have not experienced significant growth in the past five years ( nor have they grown more than 5 % annually in the past 20 years ) . 
Desperate for improvement , its leaders had few choices and limited time to explore other options . 
Instead of being creative , they have been inspired by a wave of neo-liberal nostrums that blinds them to other opportunities . 
But there are alternatives . 
Remittances by emigrants offer one of the richest . 
Nearly $ 7 billion dollars has entered the region in remittances , yet there is no single economic policy that attempts to leverage the development potential of this gift . 
Remittances normally grow more than 15 % a year , and will continue to do so . 
Even in a good year , trade with the US is unlikely to grow that much . 
Central American leaders could implement limited banking reforms to offer incentives to emigrants to save remittances and invest in their home countries . 
Instead , their attention is captivated solely by CAFTA &apos;s uncertain promises . 
What lies ahead is uncertain ; the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean stressed that CAFTA &apos;s implementation will add 0.5 percentage points to the rate of annual GDP growth in the region . 
This is welcome news . 
But the question is whether such growth will continue ten years from now or end up being a quick , but temporary , fix . 
Regardless of its prospects , CAFTA is far from a done deal , and it at least opens the way for more discussion and debate . 
Maybe the best news about CAFTA is that the US Congress is reluctant to take it on during an election year .
