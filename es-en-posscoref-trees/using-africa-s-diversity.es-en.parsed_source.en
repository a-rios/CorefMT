Using Africa \ u0027s Diversity 
When we think of &quot; Africa , &quot; what image arises ? 
Many imagine a continent consumed by poverty , war , desperation , corruption and failure . 
Yet , Africa is Morocco , Sierra Leone , and South Africa ; it is Mozambique and Mali , Nelson Mandela and Charles Taylor - the contrasts always seemingly greater than any similarities . 
No matter how easy and convenient , it makes no sense to think of Africa as a single unit , not as an economic concept , nor as a political or cultural one . 
The differences between African countries are too huge . 
Even within countries , say Tanzania where the mainland and the island of Zanzibar are usually at loggerheads , there are often radical differences in opinion and approach . 
In Africa , we can profitably speak of diversity , for in searching for solutions to the economic challenges facing Africa &apos;s countries , it is far more reasonable to think in terms of its diverse regions . 
Thankfully , this is already happening . 
Indeed , a number of interesting practical moves in this direction are underway , though not all of them pursue the original regional course set by their founders . 
The Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , for example , has unexpectedly demonstrated both the will and the capacity to raise a fighting force to intervene in regional conflicts , such as the awful civil war in Sierra Leone . 
Less spectacularly , but perhaps more important in the long run , ECOWAS is laying the groundwork for regional economic integration , with the creation of a single currency now a stated objective . 
In Southern Africa , the Southern African Development Community , after a shaky start , is pushing ahead with joint projects , of which transport infrastructure , a blight on much intra-African commerce , is a central theme . 
East African countries are also pushing integration projects ahead , and appear to have learned from past failures in the region , which were the result of hastily constructed , inappropriate , and overly ambitious structures . 
In a very different setting , the European Union was created on the basis of shared values and shared objectives . 
Its early history began while much of Europe was rebuilding itself after WWII . 
Africa &apos;s regional integration now faces a similar economic imperative ; it too must be built on shared values , rather than on vague notions of geographical determinism . 
The Organisation of African Unity , renamed the African Union , set itself impossibly high objectives when it was founded in 1963 . 
It neglected the fact that groupings like the EU began with small , practical steps forward . 
Indeed , African summits , which in the past saw democrats and dictators from different language , religious and cultural environments sharing the same table , usually produced little serious development policies because they indulged in pie-in-the-sky rhetoric . 
Proclamation of the African Union may , sadly , form part of this tradition . 
Missing , as so often in the past , is sufficient consideration of the vital ingredient of shared values and a context of practical projects for African countries to perform together . 
The parallel with Europe &apos;s integration is striking . 
European unity arose from a desire to see conflict on the continent end . 
That objective , insofar as EU member countries are concerned , has been met . 
Today , many African countries are ravaged by conflict and , as the EU rendered war between its members redundant , practical regional integration could achieve the same in Africa . 
Here ECOWAS is showing the way . 
More ambitiously , the NEPAD initiative demonstrates a new commitment by the continent &apos;s leaders to realistic joint action on a regional basis . 
Shared values and like-mindedness do not necessarily imply creating new political entities . 
Indeed , the goal of regional co-operation could be perverted if empty political rhetoric is allowed to dominate sound policy-making . 
Indeed , overheated oratory has damaged many African initiatives , and , sadly , major industrial countries and international organizations often abet this by lending verbal support to plans they have no intention of supporting with practical help . 
If any of this is to be changed , the perception of Africa as single , miserable mass that discourages both investors and global public opinion from sustained engagement must be changed . 
This means information ; more , it calls for the same type of mature , neutral and dispassionate analysis that , say , OECD delivers to its own member countries . 
The new &quot; African Economic Outlook &quot; ( AEO ) , an attempt to dispel this cloud of stereotyped knowledge by analyzing the comparative prospects of 22 countries , is based on the OECD model . 
Such knowledge is essential if investors and donors in Africa are to support the practical , regionally-based policies Africa needs . 
Policy initiatives such as debt reduction , domestic and foreign productive investment , and OECD countries opening themselves to African products , which would undoubtedly improve the continent &apos;s economic prospects , can only be pushed when benefits are clearly identified . 
Yet , increased participation in the world economy resulting from lower trade barriers will only be possible if Africa &apos;s regional institutions are strengthened . 
There is no point in advocating regionalism for regionalism &apos;s sake ; 
Europe &apos;s experience shows that agreements based on shared values , peer reviews , and with clearly defined achievable goals can form the foundation for an ever-improving economy . 
Co-operative regional projects are , today , Africa &apos;s best hope for constructing the type of infrastructure African economies require . 
African unity need not remain a dream ; it can be built through viable regional projects based on the values shared by Africans and supported by sound , reliable , analysis . 
Africa &apos;s diversity is Africa &apos;s strength .
