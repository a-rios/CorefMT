The Crisis of Fiscal Imagination 
CAMBRIDGE - Greedy banks , bad economic ideas , incompetent politicians : there is no shortage of culprits for the economic crisis in which rich countries are engulfed . 
But there is also something more fundamental at play , a flaw that lies deeper than the responsibility of individual decision-makers . 
Democracies are notoriously bad at producing credible bargains that require political commitments over the medium term . 
In both the United States and Europe , the costs of this constraint on policy has amplified the crisis - and obscured the way out . 
Consider the US , where politicians are debating how to prevent a double-dip recession , reactivate the economy , and bring down an unemployment rate that seems stuck above 9 % . 
Everyone agrees that the country &apos;s public debt is too high and needs to be reduced over the longer term . 
While there is no quick fix to these problems , the fiscal-policy imperative is clear . 
The US economy needs a second round of fiscal stimulus in the short term to make up for low private demand , together with a credible long-term fiscal-consolidation program . 
As sensible as this two-pronged approach - spend now , cut later - may be , it is made virtually impossible by the absence of any mechanism whereby President Barack Obama can credibly commit himself or future administrations to fiscal tightening . 
So any mention of a new stimulus package becomes an open invitation to those on the right to pounce on a Democratic administration for its apparent fiscal irresponsibility . 
The result is a fiscal policy that aggravates rather than ameliorates America &apos;s economic malaise . 
The problem is even more extreme in Europe . 
In a futile attempt to gain financial markets &quot; confidence , country after country has been forced to follow counter-productive austerity policies as the price of support from the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank . 
Yet requiring deep fiscal cuts , privatization , and other structural reforms of the type that Greece has had to undertake risks greater unemployment and deeper recessions . 
One reason that interest-rate spreads in financial markets remain high is that distressed eurozone countries &quot; growth prospects look so weak . 
Here , too , it is not difficult to discern the broad outlines of a solution . 
Stronger countries in the eurozone must allow these spreads to narrow by guaranteeing the new debts of countries from Greece to Italy , through the issuance of Eurobonds , for example . 
In return , the highly indebted countries must commit to multi-year programs to restructure fiscal institutions and enhance competitiveness - reforms that can be implemented and bear fruit only over the medium term . 
But , once again , this requires a credible commitment to an exchange that requires a promise of action later in return for something now . 
German politicians and their electorates can be excused for doubting whether future Greek , Irish , or Portuguese governments can be counted upon to deliver on current leaders &quot; commitments . 
Hence the impasse , with the eurozone becoming mired in a vicious circle of high debt and economic austerity . 
Democracies often deal with the problem of extracting commitments from future politicians by delegating decision-making to quasi-independent bodies managed by officials who are insulated from day-to-day politics . 
Independent central banks are the archetypal example . 
By placing monetary policy in the hands of central bankers who cannot be told what to do , politicians effectively tie their own hands ( and get lower inflation as a result ) . 
Unfortunately , US and European politicians have failed to show similar imagination when it comes to fiscal policy . 
By implementing new mechanisms to render the future path of fiscal balances and public debt more predictable , they could have averted the worst of the crisis . 
Compared to monetary policy , fiscal policy is infinitely more complex , involving many more trade-offs among competing interests . 
So an independent fiscal authority modeled along the lines of an independent central bank is neither feasible nor desirable . 
But certain fiscal decisions , and most critically the level of the fiscal deficit , can be delegated to an independent board . 
Such a board would fix the maximum difference between public spending and revenue in light of the economic cycle and debt levels , while leaving the overall size of the public sector , its composition , and tax rates to be resolved through political debate . 
Establishing such a board in the US would do much to restore sanity to the country &apos;s fiscal-policymaking . 
Europe , for its part , requires a determined step toward fiscal unification if the eurozone is to survive . 
Removing national governments &quot; ability to run large deficits and borrow at will is the necessary counterpart to a joint guarantee of sovereign debts and easy borrowing terms today . 
Yet this cannot mean that fiscal policy for , say , Greece or Italy would be run from Berlin . 
A common fiscal policy implies that the elected leaders of Greece and Italy would have some say over German fiscal policies , too . 
While the need for fiscal unification is increasingly recognized , it is not clear whether European leaders are willing to confront its ultimate political logic head-on . 
If Germans are unable to stomach the idea of sharing a political community with Greeks , they might as well accept that economic union is as good as dead . 
Politics , it is said , is the art of the possible . 
As matters currently stand , when future generations place our leaders in historical perspective , they will most likely reproach them , above all , for their lack of institutional imagination .
