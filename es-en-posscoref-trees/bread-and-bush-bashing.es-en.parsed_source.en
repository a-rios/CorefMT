Bread and Bush-Bashing 
London - I feel a little sorry for President Bush . 
Whatever his other many failings , he has a pretty good record on aid to poor countries , particularly in healthcare . 
True to form , he recently announced a big increase in US food aid - good for the hungry poor and good for American farmers . 
This was a faster response than some other countries have made to the global food crisis . 
After falling for more than 30 years , food prices have recently soared . 
The Economist &apos;s food price index has risen to its highest level since it was started in 1845 . As has happened throughout history , rocketing prices and shortages have caused riots from Bangladesh to Bolivia . 
The word for bread in Egypt is &quot; aish , &quot; which also means life . 
Threats to life bring crowds on to the streets . 
What made me feel a little sorry for Bush was the reaction to his announcement . 
Bush referred to the reasons for shortages and price hikes . 
He did not dwell on the diversion of American corn from food to heavily subsidized bio-fuels . 
Nor did climate change feature prominently in his argument , although many experts suggest that this may be the cause of the droughts and floods that have ruined wheat harvests in Australia and vegetable oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia . 
Bush pointed his finger primarily elsewhere . 
Food prices had responded to growing demand . 
In Asia , economic growth had stimulated food consumption . 
The Chinese and Indians were eating more and eating better . 
Over a 20-year period , for example , the Chinese had doubled the amount of meat they eat . 
What Bush said is of course true . 
Globalization has benefited India and China , and the rest of us , too . 
One key of the principal reasons for the world &apos;s economic growth from 2000-07 , despite wars and terrorist atrocities , was that India and China joined the world economy . 
Hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty . 
But many Indians are still wretchedly poor . 
They have a miserable diet - not least when compared with Bush &apos;s Texan neighbors . 
Grain consumption per head in India has remained static , and is less than one-fifth the figure for the US , where it has been rising . 
Think of all those T-bone steaks . 
Bush &apos;s partial explanation of the world food crisis , accurate as far as it went , brought the anger of India &apos;s media and of many politicians down on his head . 
According to India &apos;s Defense Minister , A.K. Anthony , presumably an expert on butter as well as guns , Bush &apos;s statement was &quot; a cruel joke . &quot; 
The parliamentary opposition urged Prime Minister Monmahan Singh , who wisely kept his head down , to join in the populist America-bashing . 
Later in the &quot; cruel joke &quot; week , Bush &apos;s White House compounded the sin . 
According to Bush &apos;s press spokesman , the growth in world demand for oil - in Asia , for example - was one of the causes of the high price of filling the tanks of gas-guzzling Sports Utility Vehicles , as well as more modest family cars , at America &apos;s pumps . 
Meanwhile , the US government papered over the fact that Americans , who make up less than 4 % of the world &apos;s population , own and drive 250 million of the world &apos;s 520 million cars . 
More outrage around the world at American double standards . 
Now , all this is more than the knock-about of international politics . 
One day soon , Bush and Cheney will be out of office . 
What do we do about the bottom billion in the world who remain in grinding poverty while the rest of us live better and longer lives ? 
How do we deal with equity on a global scale when we cannot even deal with it country by country ? 
This conundrum will lie at the heart of the diplomacy next year to find a successor to the Kyoto agreement . 
Can we prevent a calamitous increase in global warming in a way that is fair , that takes account of past and present responsibility , and that does not thwart legitimate hopes for a better life everywhere ? 
We have never faced a more difficult political task . 
Meanwhile , there is a food crisis to solve . 
We have already seen many examples of how not to deal with it . 
Stopping food exports is stupid . 
If we restrict market forces , there will be less food and higher prices . 
We should also avoid the cheap political trick of holding down what we pay to poor farmers in order to benefit poor city dwellers . 
Why do governments do this ? 
The answer is obvious : city dwellers riot ; in the countryside , people just starve . 
The best way to deal with the problem is to subsidize food for the poor ; we should not cut the price we pay farmers for growing it . 
Having enjoyed a few days of Bush-bashing , India got on with the job of bowing to pre-election political pressures . 
The government announced that it was suspending trading in futures markets for a number of farm products . 
India has the most economically literate triumvirate of politicians in the world in charge of its economy . 
They must know that this measure will have as much effect on food inflation as rain dancing has on the weather .
