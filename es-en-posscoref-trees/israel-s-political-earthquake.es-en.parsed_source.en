Israel &apos;s Political Earthquake 
Israeli politics is undergoing its most dramatic changes in 30 years . 
The realignment of parties and leaders is all the more remarkable because the latest developments - Ariel Sharon &apos;s decision to leave the ruling Likud party , the defeat of Shimon Peres as the Labor party &apos;s chairman , and Labor &apos;s withdrawal from Sharon &apos;s grand coalition government - were utterly unexpected . 
So it is all the more important to comprehend the significance of these changes for the future of Israel , the region , and the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
Israel &apos;s political system is , to put it simply , coming to the end of its second era . 
From independence in 1948 until 1977 , the Labor party was dominant , before giving way to an opposition coalition of conservative , nationalist , and centrist parties allied in the Likud bloc . 
Since then , the two parties have taken turns in power , sometimes in grand coalitions and often in partnership with smaller parties . 
On the surface , party competition has been between &quot; left &quot; and &quot; right , &quot; or &quot; hawks &quot; and &quot; doves . &quot; 
The truth , of course , is more complex . 
Social class and economic issues , overshadowed by the persistence of more existential concerns - physical security and the continued existence of the state - have played a much less important role in Israel than in other societies . 
Here , the political divide could be defined as &quot; optimists &quot; versus &quot; pessimists . &quot; 
The former , as in Labor , believed that some day a force would emerge among Arabs and Palestinians ready to make peace on a reasonable basis ; the latter , as in Likud , were more doubtful . 
For years , the argument remained an abstraction , a debate over what might happen in the future , until the Oslo agreement with the PLO in 1993 put the competing perspectives to the test . 
Since 2000 , when PLO leader Yasir Arafat rejected a political settlement and instead launched a five-year war of terrorism , there have been few optimists left . 
The subsequent intellectual realignment in Israel has given rise to a new national consensus . 
It is now generally accepted that , as the left has always insisted , Israel should be ready to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and accept a Palestinian state in exchange for real peace . 
But it is also accepted that , as the right has always maintained , there is no partner ready to make real peace . 
In this context , Sharon gained two landslide election victories as a hardliner , but implemented a moderate policy , including a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip . 
This is where Israel stands today , facing a political upheaval fueled by two developments . 
First , Sharon moved the Likud to the center , making it the hegemonic party , while destroying every stereotype about his personality , methods , and worldview . 
For the same reason , though , many within Likud view Sharon - who helped found the party - as a traitor . 
Sharon now needs to institutionalize his reforms , even if he now needs to establish another party to do so . 
Second , the Labor party has proven politically bankrupt , with its only conceivable leader being the 82-year-old Shimon Peres and its anachronistic dovish optimism the source of much ridicule . 
As a result - and helped by low voter turnout - the party &apos;s leadership primary was won by Amir Peretz , an outsider and populist who wants to revitalize Labor by putting social and economic issues at the forefront , which means withdrawing from the national unity coalition with Likud . 
Despite having to form a new party , Sharon will probably win the next election , which he has called for February . 
Peretz &apos;s strategy may draw voters from other parties on the left , but Labor will most likely lose centrist voters ( and those for whom national security is paramount ) to Sharon . 
Paradoxically , all of this will mean both a great deal in principle and perhaps little in practice . 
With Sharon enjoying a strong public mandate for a moderate policy , Israel will be more ready than ever to make a deal with the Palestinians , Syria , and the Arab world in general for a comprehensive diplomatic solution to the conflict . 
Yet , given the chaos and paralysis that increasingly characterize Palestinian politics , that opportunity will go untaken . 
The rising power of Hamas , which openly proclaims its strategy of increasing terrorism and its goal of destroying Israel , reinforces that trend . 
The same can be said of Syria , whose hardline government is turning toward a dangerously adventurous militancy . 
Sharon might decide on partial withdrawals and dismantling of settlements on the West Bank . 
But it is now widely recognized that such changes are a response to dim prospects of real progress toward peace . 
Holding onto territory as a bargaining chip makes less sense if there is no one with whom to bargain . 
Instead , Israel will continue to prioritize its own security , strengthening its defenses against terrorism and consolidating control over the relatively small portions of the West Bank that it intends to claim as part of an eventual diplomatic settlement . 
A byproduct of this strategy , combined with ongoing Palestinian attacks , has been growing international sympathy with Israel . 
That , too , could continue if the current political realignment proves permanent , enabling Sharon to win over the center and even moderate left for his program . 
Nothing is assured , of course . 
The still popular Benjamin Netanyahu could emerge as a powerful rival on his right , and Peretz might yet shape Labor into a serious contender on his left . 
Nevertheless , the national consensus has shifted , shaking all assumptions about Israeli politics . 
The February elections will put those assumptions to their severest test in decades .
