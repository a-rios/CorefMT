Balancing the Technocrats 
ISTANBUL - A simplistic ( actually , naive ) view of markets is that they exist almost in a &quot; state of nature , &quot; and that the best of all worlds is one where they are free to operate without government interference . 
An equally simplistic view of democracy is that it is a political system in which periodic competitive elections give the winner the right to govern without constraint . 
The reality is far more complex , of course . 
Markets can function only within an institutional and legal framework that includes property rights , enforcement of contracts , quality and information controls , and many other rules to govern transactions . 
Similarly , while competitive elections are essential to any democratic system , a &quot; winner-take-all &quot; attitude to electoral outcomes , with the victor concentrating power , is incompatible with democracy in the long term . 
Well-functioning democracies are embedded in complex constitutional and other laws that separate executive , legislative , and judicial power , and that protect freedom of speech , assembly , and peaceful dissent by those who lose elections . 
Regulatory institutions - such as bank supervisory agencies and bodies that oversee the telecommunications , food , and energy industries - play a vital role by maintaining the always-delicate balance between &quot; free &quot; markets and the actions of elected governments and legislatures . 
The central bank is perhaps the most important of these institutions , for it conducts monetary policy ( and sometimes serves as the financial-sector regulator ) . 
The policy and regulatory mistakes that contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis - and thus to the US financial system &apos;s near-meltdown and the eurozone &apos;s travails - have brought the issue of optimal economic regulation and its relation to democracy to the fore once again . 
In the US , a significant share of the Republican Party favor abolishing not only the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency , but also the Federal Reserve ! 
In their view , markets and private initiative require no significant regulation . 
The role of politics is to elect majorities that can abolish regulations and regulatory bodies . 
Others around the world similarly oppose regulatory institutions , but for very different reasons . 
They argue that politicians can regulate and supervise without intermediate bodies that have some degree of autonomy . 
In their minds , these bodies merely impede and constrain realization of the people &apos;s will . 
If an elected government wants a bank to offer cheap credit to a group of enterprises so that they can hire more people , why should a supervisor be able to obstruct this democratic will ? 
If these enterprises are told to hire the governing party &apos;s supporters as an implicit condition of obtaining subsidized credit , that , too , is the expression of electorally legitimized popular will . 
At the other end of the spectrum are technocratic super-defenders of regulatory bodies who believe that politicians and electorates are hopelessly confused , uneducated , and often corrupt . 
Management of the economy should be entrusted to competent and independent experts , a group of &quot; Platonic Guardians &quot; empowered to act in the state &apos;s higher interests , regardless of electoral outcomes or public opinion . 
The International Monetary Fund , the European Commission , and the European Central Bank are often viewed as such technocratic institutions - and as supporting the technocratic element within states and societies around the world . 
At the height of the eurozone crisis , the IMF , the EC , and the ECB ( not to mention financial markets ) warmly welcomed the economists Mario Monti and Lucas Papademos as highly respected &quot; technocratic &quot; prime ministers for Italy and Greece , respectively . 
Experience in recent decades has shown that a balanced and &quot; moderate &quot; approach is needed on these matters . 
Electoral cycles ( and the accompanying political pressures ) are such that monetary policy , banking , and many other areas of policy and economic activity must be overseen by those with professional competence and a much longer time horizon than that of politicians . 
Day-to-day politics cannot dominate the regulation that markets need . 
The single most important institutional reform underlying price stability throughout the world has been the stronger independence of central banks . 
But , if independent technocrats are allowed to determine long-term policy and set objectives that cannot be influenced by democratic majorities , democracy itself is in serious jeopardy . 
I find it undemocratic , for example , that the ECB can set the eurozone-wide inflation target unilaterally . 
How much inflation a society finds desirable or tolerable ( taking into account other important variables , such as employment , GDP growth , or poverty ) is an inherently political question that should be debated in parliament . 
The central bank should be consulted , but its role should be to implement the objective without political interference : independence in terms of policy tools , not goals . 
Globalization and the increasing complexity of financial and other markets make it imperative that the domains of private activity , political decision-making , and regulation be clarified . 
The challenge is even greater because some regulatory agencies must be multilateral , or at least intergovernmental , given the global nature of much economic activity . 
The difference and the distance between markets and politics must be clear - and , for the sake of both effectiveness and legitimacy , it must be based on rules that are well understood and on popular consent .
