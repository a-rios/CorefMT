China &apos;s North Korean Contradictions 
BEIJING - The release by WikiLeaks of American diplomatic cables written between 2004 and 2010 contains considerable material on China &apos;s policy toward North Korea . 
The leaks supposedly unveil a Chinese readiness to accept the reunification of Korea in favor of South Korea . 
This proposition almost beggars belief because it starkly contradicts China &apos;s actions in failing to openly condemn North Korea for its sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March , or for the recent artillery attack on South Korea &apos;s Yeonpyeong Island . 
Similarly , rather than demand that North Korea stop its brinkmanship , China &apos;s leaders have called for emergency consultations involving the United States , Japan , Russia , China , the United Nations , and South Korea . 
None of these actions suggest a willingness to make the North Korean regime pay the price it deserves for its provocations . 
So why doesn &apos;t China move more decisively to rein in North Korea ? 
The conventional wisdom is that China doesn &apos;t want to lose North Korea as a buffer between it and the US military in South Korea . 
Thus China does what it must , shoring up the Kim family dynasty to prevent Korea from reunifying on South Korean terms . 
Indeed , the controversy in Chinese eyes is not really about Korean reunification - few in Beijing speculate that the endgame will be otherwise - but to what extent reunification can be achieved without damaging China &apos;s security concerns . 
Every time North Korea acts provocatively - testing nuclear bombs , launching missiles , touting its secretive uranium enrichment facilities , and killing South Korean soldiers and civilians - China comes under diplomatic fire . 
Its chronic indecisiveness about the North and unwillingness to use its leverage , thus shielding its socialist ally , seems to reveal to the wider world a China obsessed with its own narrow interests . 
But these interests are hard to quantify . 
The volume of China &apos;s trade with South Korea is almost 70 times that with the North . 
Thus , if China truly is the mercantilist power that many in the West claim , it should tilt decisively towards the South . 
Moreover , China has no interest in stoking a &quot; new Cold War &quot; in East Asia , so it should be enthusiastic about the cause of denuclearization and thus play a bigger role in curtailing North Korea &apos;s nuclear provocations . 
The irony is that Chinese dithering has incited Cold War-type concerns in South Korea , Japan , and the US . 
If North Korea fails to restrain itself , and China &apos;s approach remains tantamount to coddling a dangerous , nuclear-armed state , strategic rivalry across East Asia might revive around a Washington-Tokyo-Seoul axis vis-Ã -vis a China-North Korea coalition . 
Not surprisingly , that prospect offers scant comfort to China . 
And yet China seems to turn a blind eye to it all . 
Unfortunately , China &apos;s obsolete ideology plays a key role here . 
Although China claims that it &quot; normalized relations &quot; with North Korea in 2009 , its policies and attitudes toward the North remain mired in a morbid comradeship . 
For example , in October , on the 60th anniversary of the start of the Korean War , Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping ( the likely successor to President Hu Jintao ) dubbed the conflict a glorious fight against a &quot; US-initiated invasion . &quot; 
A majority of Chinese dislike Kim Jong-il &apos;s dynastic Leninist regime . 
Yet China &apos;s leaders remain incapable of seeming to abandon the North , no matter how odious its behavior . 
Their diplomatic values , after all , were shaped by an official emphasis on sympathy for the weak in any struggle against the strong , and by comradely reminiscences about the North - far and away the weakest of the participants in the six-party negotiations over the North nuclear armaments with the US , South Korea , China , Russia , and Japan . 
In the end , Chinese outrage at North Korea usually gives way to refusal to play any part in the demise of its neighbor and one-time ally . 
More than one Chinese official has told me of holding hearty affection for North Korea &apos;s people . 
China &apos;s leaders recognize that North Korea is a huge burden for them , but , like loving parents of a rogue son , they cannot bring themselves to disown him . 
These emotional ties , combined with the usual bureaucratic love of the status quo , are the real cause of China &apos;s failure to overhaul its North Korea policy . 
Whenever a crisis erupts , China becomes agitated . 
Indeed , China &apos;s North Korea policy is dominated by inertia rather than sensitivity to its own national interests . 
Fortunately , Chinese thinking on North Korea nowadays is no longer monolithic . 
Indeed , among China &apos;s elite no foreign-policy issue is more divisive . 
Given North Korea &apos;s ability to scare China with its geographic proximity and the prospect of a sudden collapse ( with all its security implications , including an influx of refugees ) , these divisions are likely to grow . 
As a result , China &apos;s calculations about North Korea will remain complicated , even as the risks posed by the North &apos;s behavior rise . 
China &apos;s fears could be addressed by greater international collaboration , but China must be willing to cooperate as well , and , as we have seen again in recent days , it is unlikely to be forced out of its indecisiveness . 
That will only come when it opens its eyes to the real and positive possibilities of such collaboration .
