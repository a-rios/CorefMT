Sorry States 
PARIS - National repentance is in the news again , as it has been with remarkable frequency in recent years . 
In 2008 , Australia &apos;s then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologized to his country &apos;s Aborigines , while Queen Elizabeth II offered a moving gesture of contrition in Ireland a few months ago . 
And now , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , on a recent visit to the Caucasus , reiterated his advice to the Turks to &quot; repent &quot; for the massacres of Armenians committed by the decaying Ottoman regime in 1915 . 
Of course , Sarkozy would be surprised to be told that the same logic should lead to a declaration of repentance by the French state to Algeria , not to mention to the Algerian soldiers who fought under the French banner , the so-called &quot; Harkis , &quot; many of whom were abandoned to a terrible fate when France left the country in a hurry . 
As for those who managed to survive and cross the Mediterranean , France dumped them in segregated , under-served ghettos . 
For many political leaders and analysts , repentance is a misplaced and excessive form of sensitivity . 
History is tough , they say . 
Besides , where does one begin apologizing - or , rather , end ? 
Should one apologize for the Crusades , for the destruction of German cities by the armies of King Louis the XIV in the seventeenth century , not to mention the armies of Napoleon ? 
Wouldn &apos;t the result simply be to turn history into a perpetual cycle of contrition ? 
Yet , in a globalized age , which demands transparency and posits interdependence , repentance can be considered an instrument of good governance . 
A country that has lifted the carpet of myth and indifference under which the negative aspects of its past were swept is better able to manage itself and accommodate others . 
Japan has never learned to interact with its Asian neighbors the way that Germany after World War II learned to cooperate with its future European partners , partly because its apologies have appeared formalistic and half-hearted , when they have taken place at all . 
The European Union exists ( whatever its current difficulties ) because Germany asked for forgiveness . 
And Germany today is able to distance itself - though clearly at the margin - from Israel &apos;s current government because Germans fully confronted their past in ways that many of their neighbors have not . 
To ask for forgiveness enables one to speak to the &quot; Other &quot; without ambiguity , with the freedom of speech needed to express truth . 
Indeed , former French President Jacques Chirac won a place in French history by proclaiming France &apos;s responsibility for the crimes committed by the collaborationist Vichy government against its Jewish citizens during the Nazi occupation . 
The fiction , popularized by General Charles de Gaulle and pursued by Fran√ßois Mitterrand , that &quot; Vichy was not France &quot; had finally been interred . 
Who will be the French president courageous enough to apologize to Algeria and the Harkis ? 
Of course , French crimes during Algeria &apos;s war of independence resemble those of Nazi Germany in neither scale nor motivation . 
It can be argued that during the colonial era , France willed the happiness of Algerians , not only the greatness of France . 
But it was the French who defined &quot; happiness , &quot; without consultation with the Algerians , much less their consent . 
Today , as France engages the progressive forces of the &quot; Arab Spring &quot; - politically , if not militarily , as in Libya - can it continue to maintain a hypocritical stance towards Algeria , paying a high price in credibility for continuing its silence about the past ? 
In terms of forgiveness , it is the strongest party that must apologize first . 
And democracy is an essential component of that strength , for it constitutes the most favorable ground for a responsible pedagogy of historical honesty . 
Of course , one should not entertain too many illusions . 
The current Algerian government is quite comfortable denouncing France , and might continue to do so regardless of anything that the former colonial power does or says . 
But that should not serve as an alibi for doing nothing . 
In July 2012 , France and Algeria will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the birth of the Algerian Republic . 
Coming immediately after the upcoming French presidential election , the event offers an ideal opportunity for Sarkozy or his successor to engage in a symbolic act of repentance . 
Such a gesture would strengthen France both externally and in terms of the sentiments of its citizens of Algerian descent , whose difficulty in reconciling their dual identity has led some to turn to fundamentalist Islam . 
Repentance is not a sign of weakness . 
On the contrary , it is a demonstration of tranquil and conscientious strength - and a precondition of good and realistic governance .
