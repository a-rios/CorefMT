The Return of Tuberculosis 
Generations of doctors , politicians , and public health officials have struggled to defeat tuberculosis . 
But , after years of success , TB is making a comeback . 
The increase in TB in the developed world since 1992 was initially attributed to HIV . 
However , over time , other factors behind the growing number of cases , such as immigration and a particular type of drug-resistant TB , have emerged . 
The World Health Organization has developed a strategy to fight TB &apos;s return , including a standardized therapy that specifies appropriate drugs , doses , and timing of therapy . 
Unfortunately , multi-drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) , which is any TB resistant to the traditional treatments of isoniazid and rifampicin , represents a serious challenge : because standard treatment is less effective in curing it , its transmission continues . 
Moreover , any inadequately treated TB becomes multi-drug resistant , so that treatment failure can be either cause or consequence of MDR-TB . 
This underscores the need for a determined regimen to treat TB today , as well as a more complex strategy to control the disease , one which cures as many cases as possible , prevents acquired drug resistance and decreases the transmission of infection . 
The WHO recommends what it calls a &quot; Directly Observed Therapy Strategy &quot; ( DOTS ) and has set diagnostic thresholds of at least 70 % of infectious cases , and curative thresholds of 85 % . 
We conducted a systematic review of published reports to identify the factors that cause unsuccessful TB treatment in Europe . 
Twenty-six papers were included in the review , covering 13 countries ( the former USSR , the Czech Republic , Poland , and Romania in Eastern Europe , and Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Northern Ireland , Spain , Sweden , and Switzerland in Western Europe ) in the period from 1988-2001 . 
On average , the studies found that 74.4 % of the curative outcomes were &quot; successful , &quot; falling short of the WHO &apos;s 85 % target . 
Patients were treated &quot; unsuccessfully &quot; 12.3 % of the time , and 6.8 % of treated patients died . 
MDR-TB was inversely associated with successful treatments . 
We found that populations with at least 10 % MDR-TB showed a notable reduction in successful outcomes . 
Surprisingly , no relationship was found between TB treatment outcomes and immigrant status in these studies , perhaps because all immigrants were combined , regardless of country of origin . 
These results suggest the following clinical and public health implications : 
路 since successful TB treatment outcomes are below the 85 % threshold , an enhancement of national TB control programs is needed in most European countries ; 
路 MDR is the most important obstacle to controlling TB in Europe ; 
路 analyzing immigrants by specific country of origin , timing of immigration , and previous treatment can help define the risk of MDR-TB associated with immigrants ; 
路 treatment characteristics need to be reported more consistently in order to identify and correct the factors related to inadequate treatment of TB in Europe . 
Although some characteristics of TB therapy , such as interruption of treatment , are well known predictors of multi-drug resistance , other aspects of treatment that reflect the health-care system , such as the drugs used and the length of therapy , must be studied to help improve control programmes . 
For example , one of the studies that we reviewed found that no standard therapy in the initial or secondary phase of treatment was associated with an unsuccessful outcome or death . 
Moreover , some aspects of patient management emerged as risk factors for not completing therapy , which suggests difficulties in access to health services for TB patients . 
Structural barriers do not represent the only problems of access to treatment in the health care system . 
Foreign-born patients may interrupt treatment due to lack of confidence in diagnosis and care , or they may ignore the more minor symptoms of the illness . 
Patients who feel better after the initial treatment may also fail to complete therapy . 
Social factors other than birthplace should be studied to evaluate what causes primary multi-drug resistance . 
Treatment interruption has been associated with asylum seekers and refugees in Switzerland . 
Interruption was also associated with homelessness , intravenous drug use , and alcohol dependence in Hamburg . 
In Spain , homelessness was a risk factor for interruption and HIV positivity , and intravenous drug use was a risk factor for unsuccessful treatment . 
I also believe that there is a relationship between the need for therapy and the political choices that countries make . 
The DOTS strategy is not implemented in all European countries , owing in part to disagreement about whether treatment is a duty or a right . 
Public health workers argue that therapy should be imposed upon patients who are at risk of failing to complete it - a policy that others claim would violate individual liberty . 
Unless we act to step up the fight against TB , many health-care systems may find themselves facing a less abstract problem : securing the economic resources and organizational capacity to ensure treatment for the growing number of patients who want and need it .
