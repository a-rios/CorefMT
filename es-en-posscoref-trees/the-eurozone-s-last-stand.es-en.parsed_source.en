The Eurozone &apos;s Last Stand 
NEW YORK - The eurozone crisis is reaching its climax . 
Greece is insolvent . 
Portugal and Ireland have recently seen their bonds downgraded to junk status . 
Spain could still lose market access as political uncertainty adds to its fiscal and financial woes . 
Financial pressure on Italy is now mounting . 
By 2012 , Greek public debt will be above 160 % of GDP and rising . 
Alternatives to a debt restructuring are fast disappearing . 
A full-blown official bailout of Greece &apos;s public sector ( by the International Monetary Fund , the European Central Bank , and the European Financial Stability Facility ) would be the mother of all moral-hazard plays : extremely expensive and politically near-impossible , owing to resistance from core eurozone voters - starting with the Germans . 
Meanwhile , the current French proposal of a voluntary rollover by banks is flopping , as it would impose prohibitively high interest rates on the Greeks . 
Likewise , debt buybacks would be a massive waste of official resources , as the residual value of the debt increases as it is bought , benefiting creditors far more than the sovereign debtor . 
So the only realistic and sensible solution is an orderly and market-oriented - but coercive - restructuring of the entire Greek public debt . 
But how can debt relief be achieved for the sovereign without imposing massive losses on Greek banks and foreign banks holding Greek bonds ? 
The answer is to emulate the response to sovereign-debt crises in Uruguay , Pakistan , Ukraine , and many other emerging-market economies , where orderly exchange of old debt for new debt had three features : an identical face value ( so-called &quot; par &quot; bonds ) ; a long maturity ( 20-30 years ) ; and interest set well below the currently unsustainable market rates - and close to or below the original coupon . 
Even if the face value of the Greek debt were not reduced , a maturity extension would still provide massive debt relief - on a present-value basis - to Greece as a euro of debt owed 30 years from now is worth much less today than the same euro owed a year from now . 
Moreover , a maturity extension resolves rollover risk for the coming decades . 
The advantage of a par bond is that Greece &apos;s creditors - banks , insurance companies , and pension funds - would be able and allowed to continue valuing their Greek bonds at 100 cents on the euro , thereby avoiding massive losses on their balance sheets . 
That , in turn , would sharply contain the risk of financial contagion . 
Rating agencies would consider this debt exchange a &quot; credit event , &quot; but only for a very short period - a matter of a few weeks . 
Consider Uruguay , whose rating was downgraded to &quot; selective default &quot; for two weeks while the exchange was occurring , and then was upgraded ( though not to investment grade ) when , thanks to the exchange &apos;s success , its public debt became more sustainable . 
The ECB and creditor banks can live for two or three weeks with a temporary downgrade of Greece &apos;s debt . 
Moreover , there would be few holdouts that refuse to participate in the exchange . 
Previous experience suggests that most hold-to-maturity investors would accept a par bond , while most mark-to-market investors would accept a discount bond with a higher coupon ( that is , a bond with a lower face value ) - an alternative that could be offered ( and has been in the past ) to such investors . 
At the same time , the best way to contain financial contagion would be to implement a pan-European plan to recapitalize eurozone banks . 
This implies using official resources like the EFSF not to backstop an insolvent Greece , but to recapitalize the country &apos;s banks - and those in Ireland , Spain , Portugal , Italy , and even Germany and Belgium that need more capital . 
In the meantime , the ECB must continue to provide unlimited resources to banks under liquidity stress . 
To reduce the risk of financial pressures on Italy and Spain , both countries need to press ahead with fiscal austerity and structural reforms . 
Moreover , their debt could be ring-fenced with a larger package of EFSF resources and / or with the issuance of Eurobonds - a further step towards European fiscal integration . 
Finally , the eurozone needs policies to restart economic growth on its periphery . 
Without growth , any austerity and reform will deliver only social unrest and the constant threat of a political backlash , without restoring debt sustainability . 
To revive growth , the ECB needs to stop raising interest rates and reverse course . 
The eurozone should also pursue a policy - partially via looser monetary policy - that weakens the value of the euro significantly and restores the periphery &apos;s competitiveness . 
And Germany should delay its austerity plan , as the last thing that the eurozone needs is a massive fiscal drag . 
The eurozone &apos;s current muddle-through approach is an unstable disequilibrium : kicking the can down the road , and throwing good money after bad , will not work . 
Either the eurozone moves toward a different equilibrium - greater economic , fiscal , and political integration , with policies that restore growth and competitiveness , including orderly debt restructurings and a weaker euro - or it will end up with disorderly defaults , banking crises , and eventually a break-up of the monetary union . 
The status quo is no longer sustainable . 
Only a comprehensive strategy can rescue the eurozone now .
