Global Warming &apos;s Misunderstood Victims 
BAMAKO , MALI - Media organizations in wealthy countries regularly send forth reporters to find &quot; victims of global warming . &quot; 
In dispatches from the Pacific Islands , Bangladesh , or Ethiopia , journalists warn of impending calamity . 
Global warming is the most horrific challenge facing these regions , we are told . 
Its resolution is vital . 
But seldom do we hear from the local people who are said to be in danger . 
These people are not voiceless ; we just pay no attention to what they say . 
The Copenhagen Consensus Center set out to ask people in global-warming hot spots about their fears and hopes . 
In Mojo , central Ethiopia , our researchers met Tadese Denkue , a 68-year-old former soldier with no regular income . 
This is not a decent life . &quot; 
Tadese has never heard of global warming . 
When it is explained to him , he is dismissive . 
He has more immediate concerns : &quot; The first thing I need is food , and then a job . &quot; 
Tadese is suffering from his second bout of malaria this year . 
He has lost count of how many times he has contracted the disease . 
Our researcher accompanies him to a free clinic . 
The electricity is not working . 
A doctor admits that most patients are sent home without testing or treatment : the clinic has run out of medicine . 
The threat of more malaria has been used to argue for drastic carbon cuts . 
Warmer , wetter weather will improve conditions for the malaria parasite . 
Most estimates suggest that global warming will put 3 % more of the earth &apos;s population at risk of catching malaria by 2100 . 
The most efficient , global carbon cuts - designed to keep temperature increases under two degrees Celsius - would cost $ 40 trillion a year by 2100 , according to research by Richard Tol for the Copenhagen Consensus Center . 
In the best-case scenario , this expenditure would reduce the at-risk population by only 3 % . 
In comparison , spending $ 3 billion annually on mosquito nets , environmentally safe indoor DDT sprays , and subsidies for effective new combination therapies could halve the total number of those infected within one decade . 
For the money it takes to save one life with carbon cuts , smarter policies could save 78,000 lives . 
Of course , malaria is far from the only reason we worry about global warming . 
Twenty kilometers from Mojo , our researcher met Desi Koricho and her eight-month-old son , Michel . 
Every two weeks , Desi walks four hours to take Michel to the health center . 
After two months of malnutrition treatment , Michel has grown a lot but remains half the normal size of a baby his age . 
Michel is not Desi &apos;s biological child . 
She took him in after his father committed suicide and he was abandoned . 
Desi likely suffers from undiagnosed malnutrition herself . 
It is rife here . 
There are no roads , electricity , or other infrastructure . 
Conditions are cramped and unhygienic . 
Solving the malnutrition challenge would be a good start . 
Campaigners across Europe and the US use the threat of starvation to argue for drastic carbon cuts . 
For most regions , weather changes will increase agricultural productivity . 
Cruelly , this is not the case for parts of Africa that are already suffering from hunger . 
But , as with malaria , all of the evidence shows that direct policies are much more effective than carbon cuts . 
One effective , under-appreciated intervention is providing micro-nutrients to those who lack them . 
Providing Vitamin A and zinc to 80 % of the 140 million or so undernourished children in the world would require a commitment of just $ 60 million annually . 
For $ 286 million , we could get iron and iodine to more than 2.5 billion people . 
The choice is stark : for a few hundred million dollars , we could help almost half of humanity now . 
Compare this to the investments to tackle climate change - $ 40 trillion annually by the end of the century - which would save a hundred times fewer starving people ( and in 90 years ! ) . 
For every person saved from malnutrition through climate policies , the same money could have saved half a million people from micronutrient malnutrition through direct policies . 
Some argue that the choice between spending money on carbon cuts and on direct policies is unfair . 
But it is a basic fact that no dollar can be spent twice . 
Rich countries and donors have limited budgets and attention spans . 
If we spend vast amounts of money on carbon cuts in the mistaken belief that we are stopping malaria and reducing malnutrition , we are less likely to put aside money for the direct policies that would help today . 
Indeed , for every dollar spent on strong climate policies , we will likely do about $ 0.02 of good for the future . 
If we spent the same dollar on simple policies to help malnutrition or malaria now , we could do $ 20 or more good - 1000 times better , when all impacts are taken into account . 
On Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania - where the effects of global warming can already be felt - our researcher encountered 28-year-old Rehema Ibrahim . 
Rehema was divorced by her husband and disowned by her family after she failed to produce children . 
To find out if she was the cause of the infertility , she started sleeping with other men . 
She is now HIV-positive , an outcast in a terribly poor society . 
Rehema has noticed changes in the weather . 
She says that the snow and ice have been melting . 
She knows what our researcher means by &quot; global warming . &quot; 
But , she says : &quot; The issues I am experiencing have greater priority . 
The HIV and the problems it is causing are greater than the &#91; receding &#93; ice . &quot; 
Campaigners for carbon-emission reductions regularly highlight the melting snow and ice of Mount Kilimanjaro . 
But we need to pay as much attention to the people living in the mountain &apos;s shadow .
