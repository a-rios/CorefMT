The G-20 &quot; s Empty Promises 
CAMBRIDGE - Talk about &quot; exit strategies &quot; will be high on the agenda when the heads of the G-20 countries gather in Pittsburgh a few days from now . 
They will promise to reverse the explosive monetary and fiscal expansion of the past two years , to do it neither too soon nor too late , and to do it in a coordinated way . 
These are the right things to promise . 
But what will such promises mean ? 
Consider first the goal of reversing the monetary expansion , which is necessary to avoid a surge of inflation when aggregate demand begins to pick up . 
But it is also important not to do it too soon , which might stifle today &apos;s nascent and very fragile recovery . 
But promises by heads of government mean little , given that central banks are explicitly independent of government control in every important country . 
The US Federal Reserve &apos;s Ben Bernanke , the Bank of England &apos;s Mervyn King , and the European Central Bank &apos;s Jean-Claude Trichet will each decide when and how to reverse their expansionary monetary policies . 
Bernanke doesn &apos;t take orders from the US president , and King doesn &apos;t take orders from the British prime minister ( and it &apos;s not even clear who would claim to tell Trichet what to do ) . 
So the political promises in Pittsburgh about monetary policy are really just statements of governments &quot; confidence that their countries &quot; respective monetary authorities will act in appropriate ways . 
That will be particularly challenging for Bernanke . 
Although the Federal Reserve is technically independent and not accountable to the President , it is a creation of the US Congress and accountable to it . 
Because of the lagged effects of monetary policy and the need to manage expectations , early tightening by the Fed would be appropriate . 
But the unemployment rate could be over 9 % - and possibly even more than 10 - when it begins to act . If so , can we really expect Congress not to object ? 
In fact , Congress might tell the Fed that it should wait until there are clear signs of inflation and a much lower unemployment rate . 
Because Congress determines the Fed &apos;s regulatory powers and approves the appointments of its seven governors , Bernanke will have to listen to it carefully - heightening the risk of delayed tightening and rising inflation . 
Reversing the upsurge in fiscal deficits is also critical to the global economy &apos;s health . 
While the fiscal stimulus packages enacted in the past two years have been helpful in achieving the current rise in economic activity , the path of future deficits can do substantial damage to long-run growth . 
In the US , the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that President Barack Obama &apos;s proposed policies would cause the federal government &apos;s fiscal deficit to exceed 5 % of GDP in 2019 , even after a decade of continuous economic growth . 
And the deficits run up during the intervening decade would cause the national debt to double , rising to more than 80 % of GDP . 
Such large fiscal deficits would mean that the government must borrow funds that would otherwise be available for private businesses to finance investment in productivity-enhancing plant and equipment . 
Without that investment , economic growth will be slower and the standard of living lower than it would otherwise be . 
Moreover , the deficits would mean higher interest rates and continued international imbalances . 
In contrast to monetary policy , the US president does have a powerful and direct impact on future fiscal deficits . 
If the presidential promise to reduce the fiscal deficit was really a commitment to cut spending and raise taxes , we could see today &apos;s dangerous deficit trajectory be reversed . 
Unfortunately , Obama shows no real interest in reducing deficits . 
The centerpiece of his domestic agenda is a health-care plan that will cost more than a trillion dollars over the next decade , and that he proposes to finance by reducing waste in the existing government health programs ( Medicare and Medicaid ) without reducing the quantity and quality of services . 
A second major policy thrust is a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions . 
But , instead of raising revenue by auctioning the emission permits , Obama has agreed to distribute them without charge to favored industries in order to attract enough congressional votes . 
Add to this the pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $ 250,000 and you have a recipe for large fiscal deficits as long as this president can serve . 
I hope that the other G-20 leaders do a better job of reining in their budgets . 
Finally , there is the G-20 &quot; s promise to reduce monetary and fiscal excesses in an internationally coordinated way . 
While the meaning of &quot; coordinated &quot; has not been spelled out , it presumably implies that the national exit strategies should not lead to significant changes in exchange rates that would upset existing patterns of trade . 
In fact , however , exchange rates will change - and need to change in order to shrink the existing trade imbalances . 
The dollar , in particular , is likely to continue falling on a trade-weighted basis if investors around the world continue to set aside the extreme risk-aversion that caused the dollar &apos;s rise after 2007 . 
Once the Chinese are confident about their domestic growth rate , they can allow the real value of the renminbi to rise . 
Other exchange rates will respond to these shifts . 
In short , it would be wrong for investors or ordinary citizens around the world to have too much faith in G-20 &quot; s promises to rein in monetary and fiscal policies , much less to do so in a coordinated way .
