Pakistan &apos;s Tipping Point 
LAHORE - Pakistan &apos;s moment of political truth is fast approaching . 
On May 11 , some 40-50 million voters will elect a new national assembly . 
The outcome , preceded by a spike in extremist violence , is likely to reverberate far and wide . 
Pakistan &apos;s homegrown terrorist groups know that the country is at a tipping point , and are attacking candidates and voters who favor a secular state . 
Hundreds of people have already been killed , and more will undoubtedly die before Election Day , targeted because , if these groups prevail , they would push what is sometimes called the &quot; idea of Pakistan &quot; to its logical - and extreme - conclusion . 
Some 70 years ago , Muhammad Ali Jinnah , Pakistan &apos;s founding father , launched the movement to create an independent state for the Muslims of British India . 
The British colonial administration finally acquiesced , creating a country out of Muslim-majority areas . 
The population of what is now Pakistan was about two-thirds Muslim ; the remainder were mostly Hindus and Sikhs . 
That composition changed dramatically with the partition of the new states of India and Pakistan in 1947 , when 14 million people moved across the newly drawn border . 
Eight million Muslim refugees fled India and entered Pakistan , and six million Hindus and Sikhs moved in the opposite direction . 
By the time this &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; was over , Pakistan &apos;s population was 95 % Muslim . 
Over time , an increasing proportion of this population began to demand the creation of an Islamic state in the areas that were now Pakistan . 
The upcoming election will determine how far the country will go along this route . 
Pakistan is not the only Muslim country seeking to redefine its political and economic future . 
Similar processes are playing out in other large countries in the western part of the Islamic world . 
By contrast , other large Muslim countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have succeeded in establishing political orders that serve all segments of highly diverse populations reasonably well . 
That may eventually happen in the western Islamic world as well , but only after a struggle of the type occurring now in Pakistan . 
The large countries in this part of the Islamic world - most notably Egypt , Pakistan , and Turkey - are attempting to address four problems , the most challenging of which is to define Islam &apos;s role in the political system . 
Turkey seems to have found an answer , prodded in part by its wish to join the European Union . 
A conservative ruling party with deep religious roots is content to leave religion to private observance , with no direct influence on public policy . 
The issue remains less settled in Egypt , while in Pakistan a small but highly motivated part of the population has embraced extreme violence as a form of political expression . 
The role of the military in politics also needs to be resolved . 
Once again , Turkey has taken the lead ; in both Egypt and Pakistan , the men in uniform have returned to their barracks , but they have not lost influence over public policy . 
Then there is sectarianism , particularly the growing strife between Sunni and Shia Muslims . 
This conflict may be exacerbated by the outcome in Syria . 
If Sunnis triumph there , they may become more assertive in countries that have large Shia populations . 
It is not often recognized that Pakistan has the world &apos;s second-largest Shia population , after Iran , with roughly 50 million adherents . 
They have been mercilessly attacked in Karachi and Quetta in recent years , with more than 400 killed . 
Finally , there is the question of the Muslim world &apos;s relations with the West , particular the United States . 
The old post-Ottoman &quot; grand bargain &quot; - Western acceptance of authoritarianism in exchange for the secure flow of oil , use of sensitive sea-lanes , and some tolerance for the existence of Israel - has broken down . 
What replaces it will be determined by the shape of the new political order that finally emerges in the western Islamic world . 
In other words , more is at stake in Pakistan &apos;s upcoming election than just the future of Pakistan . 
There is growing recognition , some of it grudging , that the coalition led by the Pakistan People &apos;s Party has managed to create a political structure built on fairly stable foundations . 
This is a real accomplishment in a country that was on a political roller-coaster for most of its history . 
But the coalition proved unable to translate political success into strong economic performance . 
For the last five years , Pakistan &apos;s annual GDP growth has averaged just 3 % - half the rate needed to absorb two million new labor-force entrants every year . 
If growth does not pick up , the ranks of the unemployed and underemployed will swell , increasing the size of the pool from which extremist groups find fresh recruits . 
The upcoming election has both nurtured hope and generated anxiety among Pakistanis . 
It could go either way . 
And , for good or bad , where Pakistan goes other Muslim countries could follow .
