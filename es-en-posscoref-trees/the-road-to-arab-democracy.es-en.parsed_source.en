The Road to Arab Democracy 
JERUSALEM - During the turmoil of the French Revolution , a popular saying arose : &quot; How beautiful was the republic - under the monarchy . &quot; 
The Revolution aimed at achieving Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity . 
Instead , it wrought for France - and much of Europe - Jacobin terror , right-wing counter-terror , decades of war , and eventually Napoleonic tyranny . 
A similar challenge now faces North Africa and the Middle East , where most Arab countries are experiencing massive upheavals . 
Historically speaking , what is now happening is without precedent in the Arab world . 
For the first time , Arab authoritarian regimes have been toppled , and others are threatened , by mass demonstrations calling for freedom and democracy . 
Previously , Arab regimes changed through military coups and other sorts of putsches , never through popular revolutions . 
During the great democratic wave of the 1990 &quot; s , which brought down dictatorships in Eastern Europe , Latin America , sub-Saharan Africa , and Southeast Asia , nothing similar happened in Arab North Africa and the Middle East . 
Now , however , the region &apos;s political inertia has been disrupted . 
Cairo &apos;s Tahrir Square has become a symbol for both hope and &quot; people power . &quot; 
Yet , while most Arab regimes now appear threatened , only two authoritarian rulers - Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak in Egypt - have been actually deposed so far . 
Theirs were relatively &quot; soft &quot; autocracies . 
Much more oppressive and ruthless rulers - Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya , Bashar Assad in Syria , and Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen - though seriously threatened , have proven far more resilient ( up to now ) in suppressing popular opposition . 
Even in tiny Bahrain , the Sunni minority has , for now , succeeded in maintaining its rule over the Shia majority , albeit with military help from neighboring Sunni-led countries . 
As always , it is easier to bring down an autocracy than to construct and consolidate a democratic regime . 
When communism in Eastern Europe collapsed , their old systems , despite some obvious differences , had the same characteristics : they were one-party dictatorships , with state control over the economy , education , and the media . 
Today , they are very different from each other . 
Poland , Czech Republic , and Hungary , for example , succeeded in navigating a successful transition to democracy and a functioning market economy . 
Russia reverted to a neo-authoritarian system . 
The former Soviet republics in Central Asia have all developed various &quot; sultanistic &quot; forms of government . 
The reason for these differences is simple : democratic transition requires not only elections , but also several pre-conditions - a vibrant civil society ; previous traditions , whether actual or remembered , of representation , pluralism , tolerance , and individualism ; a limited role of religion ; and an effective institutional framework for a multi-party system . 
Where these conditions exist , a transition to democracy can succeed ; where they are missing , the chances - as in Russia - for a successful transition to a consolidated democracy are slim . 
Developments in Egypt will be crucial , not only because it is the largest Arab country , but also because some of the necessary pre-conditions appear to have a stronger presence there than elsewhere in the region . 
Yet , even in Egypt , the challenges are enormous . 
With early elections called for September , there is serious doubt as to whether opposition groups will have the time , means , and experience to organize effective political parties . 
At the moment , only the army - which has effectively ruled the country since 1952 - and the Muslim Brotherhood , which has the widest social networks , appear to be serious players . 
Will the army , whose monopoly of power is paradoxically legitimized by the massive demonstrations that toppled Mubarak , be willing to give up the enormous political and economic clout that it has amassed over decades ? 
One hears about a possible modus vivendi between the army and the Muslim Brotherhood . 
Indeed , some activists are already back in Tahrir Square demonstrating against such an incongruous yet possible alliance . 
In Libya , if Qaddafi falls , can such a highly tribalized country possess the building blocks needed for a functioning democracy ? 
The issue , one should emphasize , is not Islam as such : in Europe , the Catholic Church was for a long time the greatest enemy of democracy and liberalism . 
Like Christian churches , Islam can also change , and Indonesia and Turkey could well be examples for such a possibility . 
But a context in which a fundamentalist Islamic group like the Muslim Brotherhood is the strongest organization in society , with very little effective countervailing powers , creates a serious challenge . 
How will all of this influence the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , which appears stuck ? 
It may be difficult to know , especially as the fundamentalist Hamas , now in control of Gaza , might be encouraged by the rising power of its parent organization in Egypt . 
The recent escalation of violence along Gaza &apos;s border with Israel does suggest that events are developing in a dangerous direction . 
As for Israel , it initially responded to the Arab revolts in a confused way . 
Now its leaders maintain that they would welcome democratic changes in the region as a guarantor of peace and common values , though they express skepticism about whether such developments are actually imminent . 
Skepticism is in order also with respect to the unknown consequences of Western military intervention in Libya : it may have been asked for by the Arab League and legitimized by the UN Security Council , yet the outcome is far from certain . 
Whatever happens in Libya will have repercussions across the region . 
The road to democracy has always been rocky - look at a century of upheavals in Europe and the difficulties the US faced when dealing with slavery and the rights of its black population . 
It is to be hoped that there will be a light at the end of the tunnel in the Arab Middle East as well , but the tunnel may be a long one .
