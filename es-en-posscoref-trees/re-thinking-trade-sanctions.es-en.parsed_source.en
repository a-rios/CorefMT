Re-Thinking Trade Sanctions 
The US Congress has voted almost unanimously ( 418 to 2 in the House of Representatives and 94 to 1 in the Senate ) to tighten trade and financial sanctions against Myanmar , whose despotic regime harasses and repeatedly imprisons the country &apos;s rightful leader , Aung San Suu Kyi . 
She won the presidential election in 1990 but the military prevented her from taking power . 
But sanctions are the wrong approach , for international marginalization hurts ordinary citizens far more than it hurts dictatorial regimes . 
It &apos;s time to curtail the use of economic sanctions and to make them better targeted at despots . 
The most famous sanctions in recent history were those imposed on South Africa during the apartheid era . 
Much of the world community stopped trading with South Africa , and stopped making investments in South African-based enterprises . 
Those sanctions did , it seems , help speed the demise of that barbaric system . 
But one great success does not negate the many failures . 
Moreover , it is quite possible that the world community could have supported the overthrow of apartheid in other ways . 
Of course , sanctions can be effective in hurting the economy of the target country . 
Economic development in today &apos;s global economy depends on each country being integrated into the worldwide network of production , trade , and investment . 
A national economy that is excluded by sanctions is likely to stagnate or even collapse . 
Thus , the South African economy experienced an absolute decline in per capita output during the years of widespread sanctions . 
But sanctions were not the only reason for decline . 
Political unrest also devastated the economy , as did a fall in world gold prices that coincided with the anti-apartheid movement in the final years . 
Still , South Africa was hurt badly by sanctions , and the same has been true for many other countries . 
Cuba bears a heavy economic burden today not only as a result of its own internal economic mistakes but also because of the barriers to trade and investment imposed by the US since the 1960 &apos;s . 
Haiti went into an economic tailspin when America imposed sanctions in the 1990 &apos;s , ostensibly to re-establish democracy . 
Even today , the US blocks aid for Haiti because some right-wing US Congressmen are intent on toppling President Aristide , whom they abhor . 
Iraq and North Korea have likewise been battered by sanctions . 
In Iraq during the 1990 &apos;s , millions of children suffered repeated illnesses and vast numbers died because international sanctions contributed to ruining the country &apos;s economy . 
North Korea &apos;s economy utterly collapsed in the 1990 &apos;s , leading to widespread famine . 
Once again , this results from a combination of North Korea &apos;s political despotism , atrocious economic policy , and international sanctions . 
Myanmar has already paid an extremely high price for its isolation . 
International organizations have cut back or eliminated their work in the country , and much bilateral foreign aid has been eliminated , too . 
One result is that HIV / AIDS has run rampant , and the country has received almost no help in getting the epidemic under control . 
Myanmar &apos;s HIV / AIDS crisis is now by far Southeast Asia &apos;s worst . 
Although sanctions clearly create suffering in many places , how often have they achieved the desired goal ? 
In Myanmar , Iraq , North Korea , and Cuba , despotic regimes not only survived the imposition of sanctions , but became more despotic . 
These regimes were able to blame foreigners for domestic hardships , even when it was their own policy mistakes and human rights abuses that caused the crises . 
Indeed , sanctions weaken an economy and public health , but do not necessarily make it more likely that a despotic regime will collapse . 
Sanctions purportedly undermine the regime by causing widespread unrest and by reducing the government &apos;s power base and tax collections . 
But sanctions also weaken the ability of the private sector to finance an opposition , tend to cut off the domestic opposition from international sources of support , and reduce , rather than increase , international awareness of the abuses taking place . 
Some additional effects are even more pernicious . 
When legal means of business are outlawed , illegal means become more attractive . 
Many countries under sanction , such as Myanmar , become sources of global illegal trafficking in drugs , arms , money laundering , and forced labor . 
Drug trafficking or other illegal activities can overtake the whole government , turning it from despotism to international organized crime . 
Does this mean that the world should do nothing about despotic regimes ? 
There is no easy answer , but to the extent that it is possible to weaken a government without weakening an economy , such steps should be taken . 
For example , so-called &quot; smart sanctions &quot; focus more narrowly on the political leadership . 
Smart sanctions include denial of international travel privileges to despots and their families , and subjecting those despots to the risk of international prosecution . 
Leaders can thus be made prisoners in their own countries . 
Smart sanctions can also specifically target the trade in military goods , cutting off despotic regimes &apos; armed forces . 
Moreover , foreign aid can be shifted away from government towards non-governmental organizations , strengthening the civil societies in such countries . 
It is easy to vote against Mynamar &apos;s government , but it is harder to foster political change . 
Starving Myanmar &apos;s economy is unlikely to help , but it is certain to deepen the suffering of its people . 
Of course , countries that embrace the use of sanctions do not intend this , but that does not lessen their responsibility for the outcome .
