The Road to Justice in Iraq 
As questions continue to mount concerning the true rationale behind the Iraq war , we should avoid only looking backwards . 
Examining the US-led coalition &apos;s prewar actions may well expose official deception and manipulation in making the case for military intervention . 
Today , the domestic security vacuum in Iraq is so profound that it calls into question whether the war is really over . 
Guerrilla attacks on coalition soldiers show that no neat line separates &quot; before &quot; and &quot; after . &quot; 
After all , it is the rule of law - and only the rule of law - that distinguishes free societies from dictatorships . 
Coalition military officials recognize the obvious : without proof of Saddam Hussein &apos;s demise , resistance by his hardcore supporters would inevitably continue . 
But what about the need for a wider reckoning with the former regime ? 
Is justice for the victims and perpetrators of Saddam &apos;s crimes any less important for separating Iraq &apos;s past from the present and the future ? 
So far , security and law enforcement have been utterly inadequate to deal with past abuses . 
Given decades of repressive rule , and tens of thousands of disappeared Iraqis , there are already endemic problems of verification . 
Chaotic excavation and exhumation - often by family members desperate to learn the fate of loved ones - and unprofessional treatment of the evidence aggravates the challenges of uncovering the truth . 
Unfortunately , the coalition &apos;s neglect of forensic issues reflects its wider failure to devise any strategy to address issues concerning the rule of law and justice , or any central body with the authority to begin building the necessary institutions . 
While US Chief Administrator Paul Bremer recently vested authority in a number of judges , their powers are extremely limited , and apply only to present violations , not the sustained abuses of human rights that defined Saddam &apos;s regime . 
With weapons of mass destruction nowhere to be found , the justice of this intervention remains an open question - one that now turns on the coalition &apos;s efforts to establish the rudiments of legality in Iraq . 
These efforts will succeed only if they include a modicum of transitional justice . 
As the occupation force in Iraq , the coalition has undertaken international obligations , under the fourth Geneva convention , to uphold security and the rule of law . 
It cannot simply ship them to Guantanamo Bay or Diego Garcia . 
But the coalition &apos;s choices are extremely limited . 
Appointing an Iraqi tribunal capable of generating some form of legal accountability for Saddam and his henchmen - an idea that is gaining ground among Bremer &apos;s staff , at least for Saddam Hussein if he is captured alive - is unrealistic . 
No one is fully legitimate : neither those who thoroughly compromised themselves serving the Ba &apos;athist judiciary , nor exile returnees . 
Similarly , the coalition would inevitably face the charge of &quot; victor &apos;s justice &quot; were it to administer and staff its own courts . 
Only the UN can meet the demand for transitional justice . 
In this case , Chapter 7 of the UN charter gives the Security Council authority to set up criminal tribunals , as it did previously to adjudicate massacres in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda . 
Unlike the UN tribunal for former Yugoslavia , which was established 
But even such limited action is better than doing nothing . 
We know from the many cases of regime change in recent decades that the problem of transitional justice will not merely go away if ignored . 
Indeed , inaction in Iraq will not only postpone the inevitable reckoning with the past ; it may 
One of the main purposes of pursuing transitional justice is to reestablish legitimacy and the rule of law in the present . 
If the necessary institutions remain unavailable , then at the least an investigative commission should be created to establish an evidentiary record while this is still possible . 
Such a commission would afford a measure of preservative justice , enabling a more comprehensive verdict once the institutional capacity for achieving this is built . 
There is still a chance to create a &quot; before &quot; and &quot; after &quot; in Iraq , and hence to redeem the legitimacy of the US-led intervention and ongoing occupation . 
But the path lies before us , not behind us , in a sustained commitment to security , the rule of law , and transitional justice .
