Guns , Drugs , and Financial Markets 
CAMBRIDGE - The sub-prime mortgage crisis has demonstrated once again how hard it is to tame finance , an industry that is both the lifeline of modern economies and their gravest threat . 
While this is not news to emerging markets , which have experienced many financial crises in the last quarter-century , a half-century of financial stability lulled advanced economies into complacency . 
That stability reflected a simple quid pro quo : regulation in exchange for freedom to operate . 
Governments brought commercial banks under prudential regulation in exchange for public provision of deposit insurance and lender-of-last-resort functions . 
Equity markets were subjected to disclosure and transparency requirements . 
But financial deregulation in the 1980 &quot; s ushered us into uncharted territory . 
Deregulation promised to spawn financial innovations that would enhance access to credit , enable greater portfolio diversification , and allocate risk to those most able to bear it . Supervision and regulation would stand in the way , liberalizers argued , and governments could not possibly keep up with the changes . 
What a difference today &apos;s crisis has made . 
We now realize even the most sophisticated market players were clueless about the new financial instruments that emerged , and no one now doubts that the financial industry needs an overhaul . 
But what , exactly , needs to be done ? 
Economists who focus on such issues tend to fall into three groups . 
First are the libertarians , for whom anything that comes between two consenting adults is akin to a crime . 
If you are selling a piece of paper that I want to buy , it is my responsibility to know what I am buying and be aware of any possible adverse consequences . 
If my purchase harms me , I have nobody to blame but myself . 
I cannot plead for a government bailout . 
Non-libertarians recognize the fatal flaw in this argument : financial blow-ups entail what economists call a &quot; systemic risk &quot; - everyone pays a price . 
As the rescue of Bear Stearns shows , the government may need to bail out private institutions to prevent a panic that would lead to worse consequences elsewhere . 
Thus , many financial institutions , especially the largest , operate with an implicit government guarantee . 
This justifies government regulation of lending and investment practices . 
For this reason , economists in both the second and third groups - call them finance enthusiasts and finance skeptics - are more interventionist . 
But the extent of intervention they condone differs , reflecting their different views concerning how dysfunctional the prevailing approach to supervision and prudential regulation is . 
Finance enthusiasts tend to view every crisis as a learning opportunity . 
While prudential regulation and supervision can never be perfect , extending such oversight to hedge funds and other unregulated institutions can still moderate the downsides . 
If things get too complicated for regulators , the job can always be turned over to the private sector , by relying on rating agencies and financial firms &quot; own risk models . 
The gains from financial innovation are too large for more heavy-handed intervention . 
Finance skeptics disagree . 
They are less convinced that recent financial innovation has created large gains ( except for the finance industry itself ) , and they doubt that prudential regulation can ever be sufficiently effective . 
True prudence requires that regulators avail themselves of a broader set of policy instruments , including quantitative ceilings , transaction taxes , restrictions on securitization , prohibitions , or other direct inhibitions on financial transactions - all of which are anathema to most financial market participants . 
To grasp the rationale for a more broad-based approach to financial regulation , consider three other regulated industries : drugs , tobacco , and firearms . 
In each , we attempt to balance personal benefits and individuals &quot; freedom to do as they please against the risks generated for society and themselves . 
One strategy is to target the behavior that causes the problems and to rely on self-policing . 
In essence , this is the approach advocated by finance enthusiasts : set the behavioral parameters and let financial intermediaries operate freely otherwise . 
But our regulations go considerably further in all three areas . 
We restrict access to most drugs , impose heavy taxes and marketing constraints on tobacco , and control gun circulation and ownership . 
There is a simple prudential principle at work here : because our ability to monitor and regulate behavior is necessarily imperfect , we need to rely on a broader set of interventions . 
In effect , finance enthusiasts are like America &apos;s gun advocates who argue that &quot; guns don &apos;t kill people ; people kill people . &quot; 
The implication is clear : punish only people who use guns to commit crimes , but do not penalize others as well by restricting their access to guns . 
But , because we cannot be certain that the threat of punishment deters all crime , or that all criminals are caught , our ability to induce gun owners to behave responsibly is limited . 
As a result , most advanced societies impose direct controls on gun ownership . 
Likewise , finance skeptics believe that our ability to prevent excessive risk-taking in financial markets is equally limited . 
Whether one agrees with the enthusiasts or the skeptics depends on one &apos;s views about the net benefits of financial innovation . 
Returning to the example of drugs , the question is whether one believes that financial innovation is like aspirin , which generates huge benefits at low risk , or methamphetamine , which stimulates euphoria , followed by a dangerous crash .
