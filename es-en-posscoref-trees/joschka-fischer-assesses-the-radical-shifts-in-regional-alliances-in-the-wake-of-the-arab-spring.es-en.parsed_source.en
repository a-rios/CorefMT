The Middle East in the Arab Winter 
BERLIN - Travel broadens the mind , goes the old saying . 
This is especially true for the Middle East . 
But travel there nowadays can be extremely disorienting ; indeed , developments that were impossible to contemplate just a few months ago are becoming reality . 
The youth revolt that began in Tunis and Cairo in 2010-2011 has come to an end ( at least for the time being ) , though the region has been changed fundamentally by it . 
The victory of counter-revolution and power politics , as in Egypt , has only seemed to restore the old order ; the current regime &apos;s political foundations are simply too brittle . 
Equally noticeable has been the permanent shift in the region &apos;s political-strategic axis . 
Iran , with its nuclear and hegemonic ambitions , is the current center , while the old center - the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - has been marginalized , giving rise to entirely new alliances of interests . 
Saudi Arabia and Israel ( which have no formal diplomatic relations ) are united against Iran - and against the possibility of a US-Iranian détente . 
Ideologically , the central conflict between Iran and its neighbors is based on the sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia Islam . 
The devastating Syrian civil war is already being fought along these lines ; given signs of a military and political stalemate , those lines could become the basis of a permanent division of the country , as in Bosnia . 
If this happens , Iraq , Lebanon , and Jordan would not be left unaffected . 
The old Anglo-French Middle East mapped out by the Sykes-Picot Agreement in May 1916 would be gone for good . 
Moreover , the Kurdish issue has reappeared - and could indirectly influence and re-radicalize the Palestinian question . 
Unfortunately , there is not much evidence that an Israeli-Palestinian settlement based on a two-state solution will preempt this development . 
Then there is the question of the long-term consequences of Al Qaeda &apos;s rebirth in the form of Sunni jihadism in Syria , Yemen , and North and East Africa . 
The Gulf monarchies are trying to ride this tiger militarily against Iran . 
But what will happen when they one day find themselves in the role of the sorcerer &apos;s apprentice ? 
Will this fanatical wind blow back to the Arab peninsula ? 
And could these societies &quot; domestic institutions withstand such an attack ? 
Throughout the Middle East , most of the political elite remain trapped within a worldview defined by power politics and nineteenth-century notions of sovereignty . 
Their strategic watchwords are national rivalry , balance , and hegemony - concepts that offer no solution for the future of the region &apos;s nations and states . 
Intraregional economic cooperation , which is essential to achieving sustained growth and social development , much less a regional security framework to ensure peace and stability , remains an alien idea . 
In essence , the Middle East is experiencing a crisis of modernization . 
The rebellious youth who led popular demands for change are lying low ( or have been rounded up ) ; but , given the intellectual paralysis of the region &apos;s rulers ( and large parts of the opposition ) , an even more violent eruption can be expected . 
As in the past , Egypt will play a guiding role for the entire region ( whether it wants to or not ) . 
The region &apos;s modernization crisis is being compounded by the partial withdrawal of an exhausted force for order , the United States . 
This is fueling tremendous anxiety in the region and has contributed to the overthrow of existing alliances and the search for new ones . 
President Barack Obama has ended America &apos;s ruinous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Above all , it was the war in Iraq - and thus former President George W. Bush and his neoconservative advisers - that brought Iran to its current position of strategic strength . 
Yet it is Obama who is now regarded as weak in the Middle East . 
Obama is heavily criticized for not having intervened militarily in Syria , even though his threat to do so subsequently forced President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s government to surrender its chemical weapons . 
Likewise , far from strengthening Iran further , Obama has pushed the Islamic Republic into a corner by leading the global push for strict economic sanctions . 
To be sure , many aspects of Obama &apos;s policy in the region are worth criticizing - above all , the defensive attitude with which his administration presents it . 
But , rather than weakness , what America &apos;s traditional allies in the Middle East fear most is far-reaching change in the status quo . 
And Obama &apos;s policy does indeed appear to be aiming for precisely that : a nuclear détente with Iran , an end to Syria &apos;s civil war by means of a regional security architecture , and a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
It is a policy that sounds almost utopian , given the enormous inertial force of the region &apos;s problems . 
But if , against all expectations , Obama succeeds , his accomplishment will be historic . 
And if he fails ? 
The Middle East will continue its slide into mayhem - perversely befitting the upcoming centenary of World War I &apos;s outbreak .
