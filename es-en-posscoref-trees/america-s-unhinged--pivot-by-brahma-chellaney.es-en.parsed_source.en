America &apos;s Unhinged &quot; Pivot &quot; 
NEW DELHI - President Barack Obama &apos;s first foreign trip since winning a second term highlights Asia &apos;s new centrality to America &apos;s economy and security . 
But Obama &apos;s Asian tour also underscores the main question about American policy in the region : Will the United States &quot; &quot; pivot &quot; to Asia acquire concrete strategic content , or will it remain largely a rhetorical repackaging of old policies ? 
The United States , quick to capitalize on regional concerns triggered by China &apos;s increasingly muscular self-assertion , has strengthened its military ties with its existing Asian allies and forged security relationships with new friends . 
But the heady glow of America &apos;s return to center stage in Asia has obscured key challenges in remaining the region &apos;s principal security anchor in the face of China &apos;s strategic ambitions . 
One challenge is the need to arrest the erosion of America &apos;s relative power , which in turn requires comprehensive domestic renewal , including fiscal consolidation . 
But the need for spending cuts also raises the prospect that the US might be unable to finance a military shift toward the Asia-Pacific region - or , worse , that it will be forced to retrench there . 
The US under Obama has increasingly ceded ground to China , a trend that admittedly began when the Bush administration became preoccupied with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
This has spurred doubts about America &apos;s ability to provide strategic heft to its &quot; pivot &quot; by sustaining a higher level of commitment in the Asia-Pacific region , where it already maintains 320,000 troops . 
The proposed deployment of an additional 2,500 Marines in Australia is largely symbolic . 
In fact , after raising Asians &quot; expectations of a more robust US response to China &apos;s growing assertiveness , the Obama administration has started to tamp down the military aspects of its &quot; pivot , &quot; emphasizing instead greater US economic engagement . 
That change has come as a relief to those in the region who fear being forced to choose between the US and China . 
In fact , the economic reorientation of the US &quot; pivot &quot; corrects a policy that had overemphasized the military component and put the US on a path toward conflict with China . 
It was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who signaled a more hawkish US stance on China with her tough talk at the 2010 Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) Regional Forum in Hanoi ; now she is moderating that position by promoting trade and investment during her visits to Asian countries . 
Obama , too , is highlighting the economic aspects of the US &quot; pivot , &quot; portraying his Asia tour as an effort to generate more domestic manufacturing jobs through higher exports to &quot; the most rapidly growing and dynamic region in the world . &quot; 
Even his historic visit to Myanmar - the first ever by a US president - is as much about trade as it is about weaning a strategically located , resource-rich country from Chinese influence . 
The refocus on trade and economic issues has also prompted Washington to promote the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which aims to create a new Asia-Pacific free-trade group that excludes China . 
Moreover , the US is emphasizing the importance of the East Asia Summit and ASEAN , whose summit overlaps with the EAS meeting in Phnom Penh that Obama will be attending . 
The US course correction is being dictated by another consideration as well : America has nothing to gain from taking sides in China &apos;s disputes with its neighbors - unless , of course , US interests are directly at stake , as in the South China Sea , where Chinese maritime claims threaten freedom of navigation in some of the world &apos;s most heavily trafficked shipping lanes . 
Concern for its own national interest explains why America has charted a course of tacit neutrality regarding the revival of Sino-Indian territorial disputes , including China &apos;s sudden resurrection of a claim to the large Himalayan Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh . 
Similarly , the US has urged both China and Japan to resolve peacefully their dispute over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands . 
America &apos;s main goal is to prevent the standoff from escalating to the point that it would be forced - against its own interests - to take Japan &apos;s side . 
When US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in China in September , he got &quot; an earful &quot; that the US should stay out of the Sino-Japanese dispute . 
Indeed , amid the orchestrated anti-Japanese protests in China in September , Panetta - instead of advising China to rein in the often-violent demonstrations - publicly reiterated America &apos;s neutrality in the struggle over control of the islands . 
The correction in US policy actually extends even to terminology . 
American diplomats have now abandoned the term &quot; pivot &quot; altogether , owing to its military connotation , in favor of &quot; rebalancing . &quot; 
Whatever one calls it , the new policy approach is all about China , with America bolstering alliances and friendships with countries around China &apos;s periphery , including India , Japan , the Philippines , Vietnam , Indonesia , and South Korea . 
Yet the Obama administration continues to deny that China is at the center of its strategy . 
The Asia-Pacific region will loom larger in Obama &apos;s second-term agenda , especially as the ongoing US troop withdrawal ends the Afghanistan war by 2014 . 
But Obama will have to define a clearer US policy , addressing China &apos;s rapid rise under an authoritarian regime that aggressively pursues border claims and whips up nationalism at home . 
The US and the rest of Asia must not merely adjust to China ; they must seek to shape a China that plays by the rules .
