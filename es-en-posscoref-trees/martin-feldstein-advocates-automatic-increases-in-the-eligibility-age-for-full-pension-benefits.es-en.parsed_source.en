Saving Retirement 
CAMBRIDGE - Public pension programs around the world are in financial trouble . 
Because of continuing increases in life expectancy , the number of eligible retirees is rising more rapidly than the tax revenue available to finance benefits . 
In the United States , the Congressional Budget Office projects the relative cost of the Social Security program &apos;s old-age pension benefits to rise by more than a quarter over the next 25 years , from 4.9 % of GDP today to 6.2 % in 2038 . 
Because the taxes that are earmarked to support Social Security do not automatically rise faster than GDP , either the growth rate of benefits must be reduced or tax rates must be increased . 
One reason for the rapid rise in benefits stems from how they are adjusted for inflation . 
Under current US law , retirees &quot; benefits are automatically adjusted to account for increases in the traditional consumer price index ( CPI ) . 
But experts have long understood that the CPI overstates the true increase in the cost of living , and that the resulting over-indexing of benefits should be fixed . 
Part of the problem is that the CPI does not reflect how consumers change the composition of their purchases over time as relative prices change . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s administration initially followed expert advice and suggested that the traditional CPI be replaced by a more accurate measure known as the chain-weighted CPI . 
Although this would reduce the annual rate of increase in benefits by only about 0.25 % , outlays for Social Security and other inflation-indexed programs over the next ten years would be more than $ 200 billion lower . 
Applying the chain-weighted CPI to tax-bracket adjustments would raise more than $ 100 billion over the same period . 
But there is another , more fundamental reason why the traditional CPI overstates the true rise in the cost of living : It does not accurately reflect the introduction of new goods and services or improvements in the quality of existing goods and services . 
So it is unfortunate that Obama recently withdrew his proposal to change the traditional index , preferring the political gesture of &quot; protecting Social Security benefits &quot; to the more responsible policy of correcting the way that benefits and taxes reflect rising prices . 
But the more important reform for stabilizing the financing of Social Security pension benefits is to adjust the benefits for the rise in life expectancy . 
When the US created its Social Security program in the 1930 &quot; s , the legislation specified that benefits would be paid to retirees at age 65 . 
Life expectancy at age 65 rose after that by about one year per decade . 
Today , life expectancy at age 65 is about six years higher than it was in 1940 . 
The US Congress responded in 1983 by gradually raising the age for full benefits from 65 to 67 . 
Individuals who want to retire as early as 62 can still do so with an actuarially fair reduction in their benefits . 
Alternatively , they can work longer and receive higher benefits . 
Of course , the decision to increase the age for full benefits was never going to be politically popular . 
Congress was therefore careful to delay the start of the gradual adjustment , applying it only to those below the age of 45 at the time of the legislation , with the higher retirement age to be fully phased in only in 2027 . 
As a result , the public was generally unaware during the decade after the 1983 legislation that the age for full benefits would eventually rise . 
When pollsters asked voters whether they would favor an increase in the Social Security retirement age to improve the program &apos;s financial stability , the response was overwhelmingly negative . 
But here is the politically important fact : At no time did any member of Congress propose that the legislation be changed to delay or eliminate the rise in the eligibility age for full benefits . 
Congress acted responsibly to slow the growth of benefits , even though reversing the increase in the eligibility age would have been politically popular . 
Since the 1983 legislation was enacted , life expectancy at age 67 has increased by another three years , bringing it to 85 . 
There is every reason to expect life expectancy to continue to rise in the future at the rate of one year per decade . 
The obvious solution to the current and future Social Security financing problem is to reprise the 1983 legislation by gradually raising the age for full benefits from 67 to 70 , with appropriate actuarial adjustments for earlier and later retirements . 
Because life expectancy at age 67 is roughly 18 years , this would be equivalent to reducing average lifetime benefits by one-sixth ( the present value of the benefit reduction is actually higher , given that the reduction comes at the start of the retirement period ) . 
It would be even better to avoid future political posturing by enacting legislation now that automatically raises the eligibility age for full benefits in such a way that average life expectancy at that threshold is kept constant , at 15 years . 
Some experts object on principle to an increase in the eligibility age for full benefits , because some low-income groups do not experience the same one-year-per-decade rise in life expectancy . 
A simple solution to that problem would be to relate the age at which full benefits are paid to each individual &apos;s average lifetime earnings . 
A more fundamental reform would be to shift from a pure pay-as-you-go system to a mixed system that combines the current benefits with investment-based personal retirement accounts . 
Such investment-based annuities would be a natural supplement to the lower pay-as-you-go benefits that would result from raising the eligibility age for full benefits . 
Obviously , retirees deserve advance notice before benefits are reduced . 
That is why it is important for the US - and for many countries around the world - to act now to make the changes needed to stabilize future pension finances .
