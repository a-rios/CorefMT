Are Islam \ u0027s Values Really Different ? 
In the year since the terrorist attacks of September 11 th , questions about Islam - its nature , its distinctive identity , its potential threat to the West - have seized center stage in intellectual and political debates . 
While the 20 th century &apos;s major conflicts - with fascism , communism , and other &quot; isms &quot; - were primarily ideological , the terrorism of last September 11 th posed anew the specter of &quot; culture wars &quot; and &quot; clashes of civilizations . &quot; 
It is often claimed in the Islamic world that , because one of the five fundamental duties of a Muslim is Zakat ( charity to the poor ) , Islamic society is less atomistic , which limits inequality and social exclusion . 
At the same time , Western observers often see in Islam a faith that disdains personal freedom , especially for women . 
Oriana Fallaci published a long rant along this line shortly after the attacks . 
Facts on the ground do seem to support these perceptions . 
Muslim countries do tend to be characterized by lower levels of inequality and crime ( a good proxy for social exclusion ) than other countries at similar stages of economic development , such as those in Catholic Latin America . 
But do cold statistics about average income really tell us anything significant ? 
Not according to the political scientist Francis Fukuyama , who suggests that particular social outcomes ( including income levels ) result from the fact that countries are at different stages in a modernization process within which everyone and every society is converging towards a set of universal values . 
Harvard University &apos;s Samuel Huntington also thinks such comparisons wrong-headed , but disagrees with Fukuyama on the diagnosis . 
Huntington sees something sinister at work within Islam - that Islam &apos;s social outcomes reflect , not its level of modernity , but the tenets of its faith . 
Because of Islam &apos;s messianic fusion of the political , religious and cultural dimensions , says Huntington , the West and Islam are destined to &quot; clash &quot; because the two systems are fundamentally irreconcilable . 
But if we want to discover the role that a religion like Islam plays in determining a society &apos;s fundamental shape , we can indeed be led astray by making comparisons between different countries or global regions . 
We need to look at individuals 
Two studies that I conducted with colleagues at the University of Beirut use Lebanon to examine the relationship between religion and such social and cultural characteristics as inequality , preference for sons , and the degree of female labor market participation . 
Lebanon is an ideal social laboratory because it has a large number of geographically segregated religious groups and strongly enforced communal boundaries . 
Indeed , more than religion divides the population . 
Some Lebanese see themselves as Phoenicians rather than as Arabs , and claim closer cultural affinity to France than to the Arab world . 
We examined Christian Maronites ( who hold beliefs akin to those of Roman Catholicism ) , Muslim Sunnis ( the official religion of most Arab countries ) , and Muslim Shiites ( the official religion of Iran and of Lebanon &apos;s Hizbullah movement ) , and found no evidence of lower inequality among Muslims or less discrimination against women among Christians . 
Were Islamic values as fateful as Huntington suggests , there should have been sharp differences in inequality and the treatment of women between these communities . 
Our study of religion and social inequality in Lebanon examined social mobility rather than overall inequality . 
This is because societies in which opportunities and inequality are inherited are considered to be less fair than societies in which family background is less important . 
Social mobility in Lebanon , it seems , is extremely low and family background is a key factor in determining social outcomes . 
This may explain why Lebanese college graduates of all faiths often include the name and profession of their parents in their resumes , or why one of the first Arabic words that a foreigner learns after settling in Lebanon is 
The position of women also does not seem to be primarily determined by adherence to Islam . 
Indeed , we found that all Lebanese families strongly prefer sons over daughters . 
Families that have two daughters are 9 % more likely to have a third child than families that have two sons . 
Statistically , this is a huge difference - nine times larger than in the US . 
Indeed , just as our initial research uncovered no evidence of relative Muslim egalitarianism , we discovered no major difference between preference for sons among Christians and Muslims . 
If anything , bias toward males is stronger in Christian families . 
The same holds true for female labor market participation , which in Lebanon is low but uniform across religious groups . 
While this does not guarantee that no relationship exists between religion and discrimination against women , it suggests that if such a tie does exist , it is unrelated to female labor market participation or preference for sons . 
Of course , disproving the idea that different countries have different values is impossible . 
After all , Lebanon does have low social mobility , low female labor market participation , and a strong preference for sons , while other countries do not . 
Our work , however , strongly supports Fukuyama &apos;s theory that cultures and values take a back seat to the level of a country &apos;s modernity in determining its social conditions . 
So if the Islamic world is different from the West , it is so because it is backward , not because it is Muslim .
