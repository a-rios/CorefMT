The Other Financial Crisis 
NEWPORT BEACH - Two variants of financial crisis continue to wreak havoc on Western economies , fueling joblessness and poverty : the one that we read about regularly in newspapers , involving governments around the world ; and a less visible one at the level of small and medium-size businesses and households . 
Until both are addressed properly , the West will remain burdened by sluggish growth , persistently high unemployment , and excessive income and wealth inequality . 
The sovereign-debt crisis is well known . 
In order to avert a likely depression , governments around the world engaged in fiscal and monetary stimulus in the midst of the global financial crisis . 
They succeeded in offsetting nasty economic dislocations caused by private-sector deleveraging , but at the cost of encumbering their fiscal balances and their central banks &quot; balance sheets . 
While sovereign credit quality has deteriorated virtually across the board , and will most probably continue to do so , the implications for individual countries vary . 
Some Western countries - such as Greece - had fragile government accounts from the outset and tipped quickly into persistent crisis mode . 
There they remain , still failing to provide citizens with a light at the end of what already has been a long tunnel . 
Other countries had been fiscally responsible , but were overwhelmed by the liabilities that they had assumed from others ( for example , Ireland &apos;s irresponsible banks sank their budget ) . 
Still others , including the United States , faced no immediate threat but failed to make progress on longer-term issues . A few , like Germany , had built deep economic and financial resilience through years of fiscal discipline and structural reforms . 
It is not surprising that policy approaches have also varied . 
Indeed , they have shared only one , albeit crucial ( and disappointing ) feature : the inability to rely on rapid growth as the &quot; safest &quot; way to deleverage an over-indebted economy . 
Greece essentially defaulted on some obligations . 
Ireland opted for austerity and reforms , as has the United Kingdom . 
The US is gradually transferring resources from creditors to debtors through financial repression . 
So much for the sovereign-debt crisis , which , given its national , regional , and global impact , has been particularly well covered . 
After all , sovereigns are called that because they have the power to impose taxes , regulations , and , at the extreme , confiscation . 
But the other credit crisis is equally consequential , and receives much less attention , even as it erodes societies &quot; integrity , productive capabilities , and ability to maintain living standards ( particularly for the least fortunate ) . 
I know of very few Western countries where small and medium-size companies , as well as middle-income households and those of more limited means , have not experienced a significant decline in their access to credit - not just new financing , but also the ability to roll over old credit lines and loans . 
The immediate causes are well known . 
They range from subdued bank lending to unusually high risk aversion , and from discredited credit vehicles to the withdrawal of some institutions from credit intermediation altogether . 
Such credit constraints are one reason why unemployment rates continue to rise in so many countries - often from already alarming levels , such as 25 % in Greece and Spain ( where youth unemployment is above 50 % ) - and why unemployment remains unusually high in countries like the US ( albeit it at a much lower level ) . 
This is not just a matter of lost capabilities and rising poverty ; persistently high unemployment also leads to social unrest , erosion of trust in political leaders and institutions , and the mounting risk of a lost generation . 
Indeed , unemployment data in many advanced countries are dominated by long-term joblessness ( usually defined as six months or more ) . 
Skill erosion becomes a problem for those with prior work experience , while unsuccessful first-time entrants into the labor force are not just unemployed , but risk becoming unemployable . 
Governments are doing too little to address the private credit debacle . 
Arguably , they must first sort out the sovereign side of the crisis ; but it is not clear that most officials even have a comprehensive plan . 
Policy asymmetry is greatest for the countries most acutely affected by the sovereign-debt crisis . 
There , the private sector has essentially been left to fend for itself ; and most households and companies are struggling , thus fueling continued economic implosion . 
Other countries appear to have adopted a &quot; Field of Dreams &quot; - also known as &quot; build it and they will come &quot; - approach to private credit markets , In the US , for example , artificially low interest rates for home mortgages , resulting from the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy activism , are supposed to kick-start prudent financing . 
The European Central Bank is taking a similarly indirect approach . 
In both places , other policymaking entities , with much better tools at their disposal , appear either unwilling or unable to play their part . 
As such , action by central banks will repeatedly fail to gain sufficient traction . 
In fact , only the UK is visibly opting for a more coordinated and direct way to counter the persistent shortfalls stemming from the private part of the credit crisis . 
There , the &quot; Funding for Lending Scheme , &quot; jointly designed by the Bank of England and the Treasury , seeks &quot; to boost the incentive for banks and building societies to lend to UK households and non-financial companies , &quot; while holding them accountable for proper behavior . 
The UK example is important ; but , given the scope and scale of the challenges , the proposal is a relatively modest one . 
The program may stimulate some productive credit intermediation , but it will not make a significant dent in what will remain one of the major obstacles to robust economic recovery . 
Proper access to credit for productive segments is an integral part of a well-functioning economy . 
Without it , growth falters , job creation is insufficient , and widening income and wealth inequality undermines the social fabric . 
That is why any comprehensive approach to restoring the advanced countries &quot; economic and financial vibrancy must target the proper revival of private credit flows .
