Arming the Asylum 
NEW YORK - The horror has become almost routine . 
This time , the massacre site was a movie theater in Aurora , Colorado , where accused shooter James Holmes murdered and injured dozens of moviegoers . 
In 1999 , the scene was nearby Columbine High School . 
By some estimates , there are more than 20 mass shootings per year in the United States . 
And always the same question : Why ? 
When the US is compared to the rest of the world , one reason becomes obvious : while America may not have more homicidally insane people than other countries do , homicidally insane people can get their hands on guns more easily in America than they can virtually anywhere else . 
According to a 2007 survey , the United States is far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of gun ownership , with 90 guns for every 100 citizens . 
With 5 % of the global population , America has between one-third and one-half of the world &apos;s civilian-owned guns - around 270 million weapons . 
And many studies show that the US far surpasses other developed countries in deaths from gun violence - 30,000 per year , most of them suicides , but more than 12,000 of them homicides - while guns injure 200,000 Americans annually . 
With these casualty figures , one would think that gun-control laws would be a much higher national priority in America than the far more loudly hyped fight against terrorism . 
After all , ever since the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 left roughly 3,000 people dead , gun violence has killed almost 140,000 and injured more than two million . 
But , when one looks more closely at why the US is so addicted to this unique kind of violence , the obvious is not so obvious . 
Why are gun-control laws so hard to pass ? 
One big reason is the gun lobby , which is one of the most heavily funded in America . 
Few legislators - Democrats and Republicans alike - care to take on the National Rifle Association . 
And many Americans believe that the US Constitution &apos;s Second Amendment ( &quot; A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed &quot; ) permits individuals virtually unrestricted access to guns . 
Indeed , many argue that the risk of gun-related deaths and injuries is the price that Americans must pay for the right to bear arms , which they regard as a powerful defense against tyranny . 
And , given how many ascendant tyrants have systematically disarmed the population they seek to control , it is difficult to dismiss this argument entirely . 
But surely there can be a balance between Second Amendment rights and rational constraints on the ability of mentally unstable people to accumulate arsenals . 
For example , Colorado and many other states have sought to require more stringent background checks , aimed at preventing those with criminal records or obvious mental-health problems from arming themselves . 
But few such restrictions have been legislated - or have been left unchallenged by the gun lobby when they are . 
Finally , opposition to reasonable gun-control laws in America is cultural , which is reflected in the many news reports following mass shootings that , refusing to admit that America could be wrong , downplay the striking contrast between US gun laws and those elsewhere . 
So , for example , journalists stress the rather pathetic high note of a grim reality : at least there are not more massacres and murders , and the numbers are stable . 
Such coverage also tends to individualize and psychologize social pathologies - another deep-seated American trait , and one reinforced by the lone-cowboy frontier ethos that is central to US mythology ( and to gun mythology ) . 
As a result , the media tend to focus on the need for better parenting and mental-health treatment . 
But little US coverage following a gun massacre assesses the impact of America &apos;s health-care system , which is unaffordable to many , especially for those with mental-health problems . 
That is why , in many US cities , it is common to see people with serious mental illnesses speaking to themselves and otherwise acting out , sometimes violently , on the street . 
This is a far less common sight in countries with functioning mental-health systems . 
Many mental illnesses , such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , can cause auditory hallucinations that &quot; command &quot; the patient to commit acts of violence . 
Medication manages such psychotic symptoms . 
But proper diagnosis and treatment requires money , and funding is being cut . 
Indeed , according to a report in February , US states have had to cut mental-health services by almost 10 % in three years , threatening to &quot; swamp emergency rooms and raise health-care costs for all patients . &quot; 
But , if patients cannot get low-cost outpatient psychiatric care for chronic illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder - which require continual management to adjust medication - there will also be more lethal violence , especially if guns are readily available . 
Inpatient care , too , has been slashed . 
In recent decades , mental institutions and halfway houses have been closed in a wholesale way , often in the name of reforming care . 
But nothing has replaced these facilities , leaving many patients homeless and their severe psychotic symptoms untreated . 
Despite the well-documented shortcomings of America &apos;s mental-health services , few US policymakers are prepared to address the issue . 
Until they do , the easy availability of guns all but ensures that massacres like the one in Aurora remain a bitter American refrain .
