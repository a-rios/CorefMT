Can China Rescue Europe ? 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - The debt crisis in Europe is no longer a European affair . 
Coupled with fears of a double-dip recession in the United States , the European debt crisis is dragging the global economy into another cycle of financial panic and economic recession . 
Sitting on the sidelines , emerging-market economies in general , and the so-called BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) in particular , may feel fortunate to be spared this financial maelstrom . 
With closely integrated global financial markets and trading networks , financial crises and economic contractions in the developed economies , which still account for nearly 60 % of the world &apos;s GDP , will inevitably undermine emerging-market countries &quot; prosperity . 
Some have thus called upon major emerging countries to step up and use their huge foreign-exchange reserves to purchase the debt of crisis-ravaged countries , such as Greece , Italy , and Spain . 
In particular , China , with its $ 3.2 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves , is seen as a potential white knight coming to the rescue of debt-ridden European nations . 
Playing upon such hopes , China has been both coy and demanding . 
Without committing itself to any substantive assistance , the Chinese government has publicly demanded that the European Union grant China the coveted status of &quot; market economy &quot; if it expects China to loosen its purse strings . 
That status matters , because achieving it will make it more difficult for Chinese firms to be found guilty of dumping goods on overseas markets . 
Unfortunately , those who expect China to play a direct role in calming the financial panic in Europe are being unrealistic . 
Chinese leaders have been extremely risk-averse in their forays into international financial affairs , and , on the eve of a leadership transition ( expected to take place a year from now ) , no senior official dares to risk his political prospects by advocating bold and controversial action . 
Even assuming China &apos;s willingness to help Europe &apos;s troubled economies , it would be able to contribute only a modest portion of the huge amount of financing required to restore confidence in European sovereign debt . 
But this does not mean that China can do nothing to help Europe . 
While the attempt by Chinese officials to extract a huge concession - market-economy status - is ill-timed and in poor taste , China &apos;s government needs to weigh the significant benefits that it could receive by providing limited but meaningful assistance to Europe in its hour of need . 
Indeed , to do so would be in China &apos;s own interest as a key stake-holder in Europe &apos;s economic stability . 
The EU is China &apos;s largest trading partner , accounting for $ 383 billion in merchandise exports in 2010 . 
So a recession in Europe would cause a slowdown in China &apos;s export-dependent economy as well . 
The financial fallout from the debt crisis could also result in huge losses for China . 
About $ 800 billion of China &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves are invested in euro-denominated assets . 
A disorderly default , and the resulting downward pressure on the euro , would unavoidably cause Chinese investments to lose value . 
China can take three measures to help Europe , but , if they are to succeed , the EU must set aside some of its long-standing suspicions about China . 
First , China can help boost the EU &apos;s exports by lowering its administrative trade barriers to products from the EU . 
In the short term , this might dampen China &apos;s own growth , but , given China &apos;s mammoth trade surplus with the EU ( $ 230 billion in 2010 ) , this is both long overdue and reasonable . 
A 10 % increase in the EU &apos;s exports to China ( a net increase of $ 15 billion a year ) would help create at least 300,000 jobs and boost Europe &apos;s growth prospects . 
Second , China can participate in bank recapitalization in Europe . 
At the moment , Europe &apos;s banks desperately need to shore up their balance sheets . 
China &apos;s sovereign wealth fund and non-bank financial institutions have been eager to invest in well-established Western banks . 
This is a good time to do so , as these banks &quot; valuations have plunged . 
Finally , Europe &apos;s crisis presents an attractive opportunity for China to expand its direct investment there . 
In 2010 , Chinese direct investment in the EU totaled only $ 1.3 billion . 
Today , when governments and companies in Europe are opening their arms to foreign investors , Chinese companies eager for markets , technologies , and diversification should find rich pickings . 
But Chinese money has been viewed with suspicion in Europe , reflecting fears that China has a hidden political agenda . 
Such bias has discouraged Chinese capital from making bigger bets on Europe . 
It is now time for Europe to gamble on China . 
Such measures are likely to boost Europe &apos;s medium-term growth prospects . 
While they would most likely have no immediate calming effect on today &apos;s panic-stricken financial markets , they are far superior to watching with folded hands as Europe descends into a financial abyss .
