Built to Bust 
BERKELEY - In the mid-2000 &quot; s , the United States had a construction boom . 
From 2003-2006 , annual construction spending rose to a level well above its long-run trend . 
Thus , by the start of 2007 , the US was , in essence , overbuilt : about $ 300 billion in excess of the long-run trend in construction spending . 
When these buildings were constructed , they were expected to more than pay for themselves . 
Both foundations collapsed . 
By 2007 , therefore , it was reasonable to expect that construction spending in the US would be depressed for some time to come . 
Since cumulative construction spending was $ 300 billion above trend , it would have to run $ 300 billion below trend over a number of years in order to return to balance . 
So , in 2007 , everyone expected a construction-led slowdown . 
Instead , spending fell $ 300 billion below trend in 2007 alone , and has remained depressed for four years . 
Moreover , there is no prospect of anything like a rapid return to normal levels . 
Therefore , when this construction cycle has run its course , the US will first have spent an excess $ 300 billion , and then fallen short of trend by a cumulative $ 2 trillion of spending not undertaken . 
The net effect will be a construction shortfall in the US of at least $ 1.7 trillion . 
That is a lot of unbuilt houses , apartment buildings , offices , and stores - and it is a truly radical disconnect between the size of the recent construction boom and the size of the current construction bust . 
Indeed , this radical disproportion makes nonsense of all arguments that the current distressed state of the overall US economy is in some sense necessary , deserved , or an inevitable consequence of over-exuberant building in the desert between Los Angeles , California and Albuquerque , New Mexico in the mid-2000 &quot; s . 
Otherwise , the construction-led economic slowdown would not be today &apos;s $ 1 trillion in annual lost production . 
The slowdown would be one-tenth the size of the one the US is now enduring , and it would be largely confined to the construction sector . 
And , in that alternative universe , having worked off the entire burden of overbuilding , we would by now have returned to trend levels of production , employment , and demand . 
There is one silver lining as we contemplate our macroeconomic wreckage : when incomes , production , and employment in the US return to their trend levels , Americans will demand an extra $ 1.7 trillion worth of buildings to live in . 
If America does recover to the previous long-run trend , the next decade will likely witness a construction boom that puts the mid-2000 &quot; s boom in the shade . 
There is another lesson here . 
The economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart argue that recovery after a financial crisis is almost always slow . 
One factor behind slow post-financial-crisis recovery is that nobody knows how the division of labor will be rearranged . 
We know that when Americans become confident again - when they believe that they could find new jobs if they lost their current ones , and when they can no longer tolerate doubling-up with their in-laws - they will demand more dwellings than the country has today . 
If incomes and demand were normal , we would want a lot more new construction then we do now . 
But , even though we can see the magnitude of the construction shortfall and understand how large it will be when recovery is complete , that does not help right now . 
Right now , incomes are slack , households have become crowded , and there is a surplus of housing on the market - all because nominal demand is still far below trend . 
In 20 years , historians will interview the then-aged monetary , banking , and fiscal policymakers of the 2000 &quot; s . 
They will ask them why they did not take more aggressive steps to return nominal incomes and demand to trend levels when they were sitting in the hot seats . 
I already wonder what their excuses will be .
