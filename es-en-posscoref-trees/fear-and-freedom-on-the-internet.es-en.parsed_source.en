Fear and Freedom on the Internet 
Earlier this month it was reported that , at the request of China &apos;s rulers , Microsoft shut down the Web site of a Chinese blogger that was maintained on a Microsoft service called MSN Spaces . 
The blogger , Zhao Jing , had been reporting on a strike by journalists at The Beijing News that followed the dismissal of the newspaper &apos;s independent-minded editor . 
Microsoft &apos;s action raises a key question : can the Internet really be a force for freedom that repressive governments cannot control as easily as newspapers , radio , and television ? 
Ironically , Microsoft &apos;s founder and chairman , Bill Gates , has been an enthusiastic advocate of this view . 
Just last October , he said : &quot; There &apos;s really no way to , in a broad sense , repress information today , and I think that &apos;s a wonderful advance we can all feel good about .... &#91; T &#93; his is a medium of total openness and total freedom , and that &apos;s what makes it so special . &quot; 
Despite these sentiments , Microsoft is helping the Chinese authorities to repress information as best they can . 
A Microsoft spokeswoman was reported as saying that the corporation has blocked &quot; many sites &quot; in China , and it has been known for several months that Microsoft &apos;s blog tool in China filters words like &quot; democracy &quot; and &quot; human rights &quot; from blog titles . 
Microsoft &apos;s defense is that it must &quot; comply with local and global laws . &quot; 
But the MSN Spaces sites are maintained on servers in the United States . 
The relevant local laws would therefore seem to be those of the US , and Zhao Jing &apos;s discussion of the Beijing journalists &quot; strike does not violate any of them . 
Nor are there any global laws that prevent Chinese people from discussing events that their government would prefer them not to discuss . 
TheNew York Times , for example , is free to publish its report on the strike , even though it operates a Web site that anyone with unfettered Internet access can read . 
If the Chinese government does not want its citizens to read a foreign newspaper , then it is up to them to figure out how to block access to it . 
The newspaper is under no obligation to do it for them . 
So Microsoft &apos;s defense misfires . 
We can only guess at the company &apos;s real reason for taking down the Web site , but fear of repercussions against its commercial interests in China seems likely to have been an important factor . 
To be sure , a corporation can and should place limits on the use of its services . 
The absolutist line - let complete freedom of expression prevail - crumbles in the face of uncomfortable examples . 
According to Gates , Microsoft might prevent the use of its services to spread instructions about making nuclear bombs , to send pro-Nazi statements into Germany , where such material is illegal , and to propagate child pornography . 
But how relevant are such examples ? 
In his classic defense of freedom of expression , On Liberty , John Stuart Mill argued that the most important reason for freedom of expression is to promote competition between the widest possible range of ideas , and that unfettered debate is the best way to test them . 
For the government to protect ideas from criticism is to turn them into a lifeless and rigid dogma , regardless of whether they are true . 
If we agree with Mill , then only one of Gates &apos;s examples falls into the category of expression that should be protected . 
Recipes for making nuclear bombs are techniques , not ideas . 
Nor is child pornography the expression of ideas . 
We may therefore restrict both of them without running afoul of Mill &apos;s argument . 
( On the other hand , an essay arguing that there is nothing wrong with adults taking a sexual interest in children , and that such conduct should be permitted , expresses ideas , and thus should not be censored , no matter how poisonous we may consider them . ) 
The most difficult of Gates &apos;s three examples is that of pro-Nazi statements on a Web site aimed at Germany . 
It is easy to understand why Germany would wish to prohibit such statements . 
Several countries &quot; laws proscribe incitement of racial hatred , which can be justified , consistently with Mill &apos;s defense of liberty , if such laws really focus narrowly on incitement of hatred rather than on suppressing arguments , bad as they may be , that appeal to people &apos;s intellectual capacities . 
A defender of suppression of Nazi ideas might argue that have already been tried , and have failed - in the most horrendous manner imaginable - to produce a better society . 
Nevertheless , the best possible sign that Germany has overcome its Nazi past would be to focus its laws specifically on incitement to racial hatred , rather than on Nazism as such . 
In any case , China &apos;s crackdown on straightforward reporting and discussion of events taking place in that country is not the suppression of a discredited political ideology , but of open and informed political debate . 
If Bill Gates really believes that the Internet should be a liberating force , he should ensure that Microsoft does not do the dirty work of China &apos;s government .
