Is Honest Politics Possible ? 
&quot; Those who desire to treat politics and morals separately will never understand anything of either . &quot; 
So wrote Jean-Jacques Rousseau , and I agree . 
The practice of politics not only can but must be reconciled with the imperatives of honesty . 
But what is honesty or dishonesty in a politician ? 
Is it possible for a politician to be honest at all ? 
The question goes to the heart of democracy . 
When voters write off politicians as dishonest , anti-democratic movements thrive . 
Yet all politicians know that ambiguity and compromise tend to prevail over universal truths . 
Sometimes one must choose the lesser evil . 
Our ordinary standards of decency and righteousness cannot always be applied - but not because cynicism and hypocrisy are all that matter in politics . 
Consider , for example , that prince of ambiguity , the Duc de Talleyrand . 
Not only corrupt , but a notorious traitor to consecutive masters , Talleyrand was said to have failed to sell his own mother only because there were no takers . 
Yet , although serially disloyal to French rulers , Talleyrand probably never betrayed France . 
Political dishonesty , it turns out , takes different forms . 
Let us identify the various types . 
One type is someone who is a dishonest man or woman to begin with . 
Such a person will be a dishonest leader , ideologue , or diplomat in any circumstance . 
Another type is the well-meaning dilettante . 
Clumsy and amateurish , the dilettante &apos;s actions harm the interests he aims to advance . 
Political &quot; gamblers , &quot; on the other hand , put competence to bad use . 
They are skilled but ruthless , lack humility and eschew reflection . 
The gambler &apos;s close kin is the political &quot; troublemaker , &quot; who pursues his soaring ambitions by any means necessary , whatever the risks and regardless of the cost to others . 
The political &quot; fanatic &quot; is also dishonest , for he is blinded by the conviction that he is absolutely right in all cases . 
The fanatic is inflexible and inertial , a steamroller ready to flatten everything in his way . 
By contrast , the political &quot; wheeler-dealer &quot; is no less dishonest , for he lacks what the first President Bush called the &quot; vision thing . &quot; 
He is spineless , devoid of principle , and retreats in the face of responsibility . 
Beyond these distinct types of dishonest politicians are more general political postures . 
Cynical forms of pragmatism take the lead , embodied in the principle that the end justifies the means whenever moral imperatives conflict with political interests . 
At the other extreme is a naive , utopian , and moralistic stance that is equally dishonest . 
Its acolytes deplore the grit and relativism of politics and issue futile appeals for moral revivals . 
But things are not that simple . 
History is not an idyll and politicians &apos; biographies do not read like the lives of the saints . 
Paradoxically , if all people were honest , politics would become redundant . 
This does not mean that we cannot identify honest politicians when we see them . 
Immanuel Kant described two types of politicians . 
The political moralist wants to &quot; hammer out morality &quot; in keeping with the requirements of politics construed as a cynical game . 
It is a label that easily applies to all the types of dishonest politicians described above . 
Kant &apos;s second type is the moral politician , who rejects cynical pragmatism but does not succumb to naive moralising . 
An honest politician is someone who regards politics as a tool for achieving the common good . 
He is not naive , and knows that patience , compromise , and a policy of small steps are often needed . 
Yet in pursuing partial goals he will not lose sight of higher objectives . 
An honest politician , in short , pursues a pragmatism built on principles , on the courage to say unpleasant things , but always with a constructive attitude . 
Indeed , irresponsible criticism - the eagerness to expose and publicize a problem , unmatched by the willingness to propose feasible solutions - is perhaps the most common form of dishonesty in politics . 
This is why actual governance is so often the best test of political honesty . 
In democratic countries , if politicians who are critical of others while in opposition prove to be ineffective when in government , voters can - and often do - punish their dishonesty at the ballot box . 
The toughest test of an honest politician comes when he or she must defend ideas that are unpopular but right . 
Not everyone passes such a test , particularly when elections are approaching . 
However , only the dishonest politician equates politics exclusively with popularity . 
At the same time , a moral politician never succeeds single-handedly in ensuring the common good . 
Only when politicians support one another &apos;s decency can they be confident that in critical moments for the state , they can rise above their political divisions . 
But political honesty is not the sole responsibility of politicians . 
Public opinion must play its part as well . 
After all , political honesty - and honest politicians - is more likely to take root in a society marked by a culture of tolerance , solidarity , and the equal enjoyment of individual rights . 
Political mischief-makers do poorly in such soil . 
I am a political practitioner , first and foremost . 
So I know that no theory , no amount of analysis , can free a politician from bouts of soul-searching , from troubling his or her conscience with questions about what is and what is not honest when confronting political choices . 
Above all else , the honest politician willingly shoulders this burden .
