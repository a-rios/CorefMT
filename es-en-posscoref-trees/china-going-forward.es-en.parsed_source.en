China Going Forward 
BEIJING - China &apos;s per capita income , at $ 3,800 , has now surpassed the threshold for a middle-income country . 
But , even as economists and strategists busily extrapolate China &apos;s future growth path to predict when it will catch up to the United States , the mood inside China became somber and subdued in 2010 . 
Indeed , Premier Wen Jiabao sees China &apos;s growth as &quot; unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and ultimately unsustainable . &quot; 
Economic growth , of course , has never been linear in any country . 
Throughout history , there are countless examples of middle-income countries becoming stuck in that category for decades and / or eventually falling back to low-income status . 
The Nobel laureate economist Michael Spence has pointed out that after WWII , only a handful of countries were able to grow to a fully-industrialized level of development . 
China &apos;s progress over the past three decades is a successful variation on the East Asian growth model that stems from the initial conditions bequeathed by a planned socialist economy . 
That growth model has now almost exhausted its potential . 
So China has reached a crucial juncture : without painful structural adjustment , its economic-growth momentum can suddenly be lost . 
China &apos;s rapid growth has been achieved at extremely high cost . 
Only future generations will know the true price . 
The country &apos;s investment rate now stands at more than 50 % - a clear reflection of China &apos;s low capital efficiency . 
There are two worrying aspects of this high rate . 
First , local governments influence a large proportion of investment decisions . 
Second , investment in real-estate development accounts for nearly one-quarter of the total . 
Some local governments are literally digging holes and then filling them in order to create GDP . 
As a result , there are simply too many luxurious condominiums , magnificent government office buildings , and soaring skyscrapers . 
Hotels in China &apos;s provincial cities can make five-star hotels in Western capitals looked shabby . 
China has become one of the most polluted countries in the world . 
Dust and smog choke its cities . 
All of the country &apos;s major rivers are contaminated . 
Deforestation and desertification are rampant . 
Drought , floods , and landslides have become commonplace . 
Relentless extraction is quickly depleting China &apos;s resource deposits . 
With China &apos;s trade-to-GDP ratio and exports-to-GDP ratio already exceeding 60 % and 30 % , respectively , the economy cannot continue to depend on external demand to sustain growth . 
Unfortunately , with a large export sector that employs scores of millions of workers , this dependence has become structural , which implies that to reduce China &apos;s trade dependency and trade surplus is much more than a matter of adjusting macroeconomic policy . 
After decades of rapid expansion , China has become the workshop of the global economy . 
The problem is that it is no more than a workshop : lack of innovation and creation form the economy &apos;s Achilles &quot; heel . 
For example , in volume terms , China now is the largest car producer in the world , churning out 17 million this year . 
But the share of models developed by Chinese carmakers is negligible . 
In an era of rapid technological progress , creativity , and innovation , the global economic landscape can change rapidly . 
Without a strong capacity for innovation and creativity , even a giant has feet of clay . 
And when a giant falls , many are hurt . 
Indeed , while China &apos;s living standards have risen dramatically over the past 30 years , the gap between rich and poor has widened sharply . 
Income distribution has skewed in favor of the rich for too long , and the government has failed to provide decent public goods . 
With the contrast between the opulent lifestyle of the rich and the slow improvement of living conditions for the poor fomenting social tension , a serious backlash is in the making . 
If China fails to tackle its structural problems in a timely fashion , growth is unlikely to be sustainable . 
Any structural adjustment is painful . 
But the longer the delay , the more painful it will be . 
China &apos;s strong fiscal position today gives it a window of opportunity . 
But that window will close fast , because beneficiaries of specific reform policies have morphed into vested interests , which are fighting hard to protect what they have . 
What the Chinese public resents most is the collusion between government officials and businesspeople , described by the respected Chinese economist Wu Jianglian as &quot; capitalism of the powerful and rich . &quot; 
Breaking this unholy alliance will be the big test for China &apos;s leadership in 2011and beyond . 
Under China &apos;s current institutional arrangements , meritocracy is a prerequisite for good governance . 
But meritocracy has been eroded by a political culture of sycophancy and cynicism . 
So once again , the dialectics of economic development has brought political reform back to the fore . 
Abroad , China &apos;s rise has caused admiration , envy , suspicion , and even outright hostility in some corners . 
No matter how often Chinese leaders repudiate any hegemonic ambition , wariness about China &apos;s true intentions will remain . 
That is understandable : the rise of new powers has always disrupted the established international order . 
When this new power is a nation of 1.3 billion people living under an alien political system and ideology , its rise is bound to cause even more uneasiness . 
Fortunately , because of globalization , China &apos;s rise is in everyone &apos;s interest , as is the rise of other emerging economies . 
In the coming years , in areas such as climate change , global imbalances , and reform of the international monetary system , China should and will play a more active role as a major global stakeholder . 
Needless to say , reciprocity will be necessary .
