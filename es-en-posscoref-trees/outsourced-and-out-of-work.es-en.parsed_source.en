Outsourced and Out of Work 
The latest buzzword in the globalization debate is outsourcing . 
Suddenly Americans - long champions of globalization - seem concerned about its adverse effects on their economy . 
Its ardent defenders are , of course , untroubled by the loss of jobs . 
They stress that outsourcing cuts costs - just like a technological change that improves productivity , thus increasing profits - and what is good for profits must be good for the American economy . 
The laws of economics , they assert , ensure that in the long run there will be jobs for everyone who wants them , so long as government does not interfere in market processes by setting minimum wages or ensuring job security , or so long as unions don &apos;t drive up wages excessively . 
In competitive markets , the law of demand and supply ensures that eventually , in the long run , the demand for labor will equal the supply - there will be no unemployment . 
But as Keynes put it so poignantly , in the long run , we are all dead . 
Those who summarily dismiss the loss of jobs miss a key points : America &apos;s economy has not been performing well . 
In addition to the trade and budget deficits , there is a jobs deficit . 
Over the past three and a half years , the economy should have created some 4 to 6 million jobs to provide employment for new entrants into the labor force . 
In fact , more than 2 million jobs have been destroyed - the first time since Herbert Hoover &apos;s presidency at the beginning of the Great Depression that there has been a net job loss in the US economy over the term of an entire presidential administration . 
At the very least , this shows that markets by themselves do not quickly work to ensure that there is a job for everyone who wishes to work . 
There is an important role for government in ensuring full employment - a role that the Bush administration has badly mismanaged . 
Were unemployment lower , the worries about outsourcing would be less . 
But there is , I think , an even deeper reason for concerns about outsourcing of , say , hi-tech jobs to India : it destroys the myth - which has been a central tenet of the globalization debate in the US and other advanced industrial countries - that workers should not be afraid of globalization . 
Yes , apologists of outsourcing say , rich countries will lose low-skilled jobs in areas like textiles to low wage labor in China and elsewhere . 
But this is supposedly a good thing , not a bad thing , because America should be specializing in its areas of comparative advantage , involving skilled labor and advanced technology . 
What is required is &quot; upskilling , &quot; improving the quality of education , especially in science and technology . 
But this argument no longer seems convincing . 
America is producing fewer engineers than China and India , and , even if engineers from those developing countries are at some disadvantage , either because of training or location , that disadvantage is more than offset by wage differentials . 
American and rich country engineers and computer specialists will either have to accept a wage cut and / or they will be forced into unemployment and / or to seek other employment - almost surely at lower wages . 
If America &apos;s highly trained engineers and computer specialists are unable to withstand the onslaught of outsourcing , what about those who are even less trained ? 
Yes , America may be able to maintain a competitive advantage at the very top , the breakthrough research , the invention of the next laser . 
But a majority of even highly training engineers and scientists are involved in what is called &quot; ordinary science , &quot; the important , day-to-day improvements in technology that are the basis of long-term increases in productivity - and it is not clear that America has a long-term competitive advantage here . 
Two lessons emerge from the outsourcing debate . 
First , as America grapples with the challenges of adjusting to globalization , it should be more sensitive to the plight of developing countries , which have far fewer resources to cope . 
After all , if America , with its relatively low level of unemployment and social safety net , finds it must take action to protect its workers and firms against competition from abroad - whether in software or steel - such action by developing countries is all the more justified . 
Second , the time for America to worry is now . 
Many of globalization &apos;s advocates continue to claim that the number of jobs outsourced is relatively small . 
There is controversy , of course , about the eventual size , with some claiming that as many as one job in two might eventually be outsourced , others contending that the potential is much more limited . 
Haircuts , like a host of other activities requiring detailed local knowledge , cannot be outsourced . 
But even if the eventual numbers are limited , there can be dramatic effects on workers and the distribution of income . 
Growth will be enhanced , but workers may be worse off - and not just those who lose their jobs . 
This has , indeed , already happened in some developed countries : in the ten years that have passed since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement , average real wages in the US have actually declined . 
Putting one &apos;s head in the sand and pretending that everyone will benefit from globalization is foolish . 
The problem with globalization today is precisely that a few may benefit and a majority may be worse off , unless government takes an active role in managing and shaping it . 
This is the most important lesson of the ongoing debate over outsourcing .
