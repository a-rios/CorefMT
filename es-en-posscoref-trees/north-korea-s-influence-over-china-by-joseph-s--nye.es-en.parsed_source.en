North Korea &apos;s Powerful Weakness 
CAMBRIDGE - When US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping met for their &quot; shirt-sleeves summit &quot; in California last month , North Korea was a major topic of conversation . 
The subject was not new , but the tone was . 
More than two decades ago , the International Atomic Energy Agency caught North Korea violating its safeguards agreement and reprocessing plutonium . 
After the North renounced the subsequent Agreed Framework , negotiated by President Bill Clinton &apos;s administration , in 2003 , it expelled IAEA inspectors , withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and has since detonated three nuclear devices and conducted a variety of missile tests . 
During those two decades , American and Chinese officials frequently discussed North Korea &apos;s behavior , both privately and in public meetings . 
The Chinese consistently said that they did not want North Korea to develop nuclear weapons , but claimed that they had limited influence over the regime , despite being its major supplier of food and fuel . 
The result was a somewhat scripted exchange in which China and the US would accomplish little more than professing denuclearization as a shared goal . 
China was sincere in expressing its desire for a non-nuclear Korean Peninsula , but the nuclear issue was not its primary concern . 
It also sought to prevent the collapse of the North Korean regime and the resulting potential for chaos on its border - not only flows of refugees , but also the possibility that South Korean or US troops could move into the North . 
Torn between its two objectives , China placed a higher priority on preserving the Kim family dynasty . 
North Korea has what I call &quot; the power of weakness . &quot; 
In certain bargaining situations , weakness and the threat of collapse can be a source of power . 
To take a well-known example , if you owe a bank $ 1,000 , the bank has power over you ; but if you owe the bank $ 1 billion , you may have considerable bargaining power over the bank . 
China is , in this sense , North Korea &apos;s over-exposed banker . 
As a result , China has tried to persuade North Korea to follow its market-oriented example . 
But , with the Kim regime terrified that economic liberalization would eventually provoke demands for greater political freedom , China &apos;s influence over the regime is limited . 
As a Chinese official once told me in an unguarded moment , &quot; North Korea has hijacked our foreign policy . &quot; 
North Korea has amplified its power by playing its weak hand audaciously . 
The North &apos;s leaders know that superior South Korean and US military forces would win a full-scale military conflict . 
And yet , with 15,000 artillery tubes in the Demilitarized Zone , just 30 miles ( 48 kilometers ) north of Seoul , the South Korean capital , they also know that they could wreak havoc on South Korea &apos;s economy , whereas the North has relatively less to lose . 
North Korea has long been adept at flaunting its willingness to take risks , provoking a crisis in 2010 by sinking a South Korean naval vessel and shelling a South Korean island . 
This spring , it conducted a nuclear test and a series of missile tests , accompanied by a stream of bellicose rhetoric . 
Now it appears that China is beginning to lose patience . 
It has less confidence in the North &apos;s inexperienced new ruler , Kim Jong-un , than it had in his father , Kim Jong-il . 
Chinese leaders are also beginning to recognize the risks that North Korea is imposing on China . 
With more nuclear tests , a demand for nuclear weapons could grow in South Korea and Japan . 
Moreover , if this spring &apos;s sharp rhetoric from the Kim regime is followed by provocations against South Korea like those that occurred in 2010 , South Korea could respond forcefully , and China might be drawn in . 
The signs of a change are intriguing . 
Following the &quot; frank &quot; discussion of North Korea by Xi and Obama , Xi hosted a summit with South Korean President Park Geun-hye , without first meeting with its official North Korean ally . 
Instead , two senior North Korean officials subsequently visited Beijing and were scolded for the North &apos;s behavior . 
By contrast , Xi and Park issued a joint statement proclaiming the importance of faithfully implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions that call for sanctions against North Korea , as well as a multilateral agreement in 2005 that obliges the North to exchange its nuclear-weapons programs for economic and diplomatic benefits . 
Both leaders urged a resumption of the six-party talks on denuclearization , which have been suspended since 2009 . 
What comes next is uncertain . 
North Korea has tempered its rhetoric and behavior , but the Kim regime has given no indication that it is willing to give up the nuclear-weapons program that it regards as vital to its security and prestige . 
In the long run , economic and social change may help to resolve the situation . 
China &apos;s dilemma remains that if it pushes too fast for reform , the Kim regime may collapse . 
Faced with that prospect , the US and South Korea could take steps to reassure China that they would not exploit such a situation by moving their troops to China &apos;s border . 
In the past , when the US has suggested quiet talks to discuss contingency planning in the case of regime collapse , China has been wary of offending and weakening North Korea . 
But finding a formula to talk about such contingencies may be the next step for China as it seeks to overcome its quandary .
