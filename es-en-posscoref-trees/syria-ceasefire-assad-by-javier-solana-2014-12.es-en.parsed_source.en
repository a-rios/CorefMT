No More Aleppos 
MADRID - It has been nearly four years since the first uprisings in Damascus and the beginning of the Syrian civil war . 
Across the country , more than 240,000 people have died . 
Another 7.5 million have lost their homes or fled the country , becoming refugees . 
Syria is drowning in a bloody , cruel , and pointless conflict . 
It is time to say &quot; enough &quot; - starting in the devastated city of Aleppo . 
Bringing the fighting to a halt will not be easy . 
It will require the coordination and cooperation of regional and global rivals . 
But the chance to forge a ceasefire is not only an opportunity to end a humanitarian disaster ; it could also mark the beginning of a new approach to resolving and preventing crises elsewhere . 
Aleppo is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world - and one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the war . 
The ancient walled city is one of Syria &apos;s six UNESCO World Heritage sites . 
Much of it has already been irreversibly damaged . 
Today , Aleppo is under rebel control - surrounded by the Syrian army . 
Militants loyal to the Islamic State lie in wait a few dozen kilometers away . 
The series of international failures in this conflict so far is inexcusable . 
Each subsequent breakdown in negotiations , including the Geneva talks , has not only led away from peace , but has also contributed to calamitous developments , including the resurgence of extremist terrorism and the emergence of the Islamic State . 
A ceasefire in Aleppo cannot be postponed any further . 
Enormous humanitarian efforts will be needed to address the catastrophic situation the war has left , and UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura &apos;s immense dedication will be critical . 
Fortunately , Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s two main allies , Iran and Russia , have reasons for seeking a ceasefire . 
Falling oil prices and economic sanctions have affected both countries . 
Iran increasingly feels drained by the economic support it gives to the Syrian army and to Hezbollah in Lebanon , while Russia &apos;s authorities , now also confronting a currency crisis , are battling the perfect storm . 
Both countries also have reasons to demonstrate that they can contribute to regional and global stability - Iran , especially , as international negotiations over its nuclear program are at a critical stage . 
If Russia and Iran threaten to withdraw support , Assad will have no option other than to come to the table . 
However , the biggest obstacle to a ceasefire is the same one that presented itself during negotiations over Syria &apos;s chemical weapons : any deal will require accepting Assad as a partner in the negotiations . 
If a ceasefire is achieved at this stage , it will reflect the rapidly shifting nature of today &apos;s geopolitical environment . 
Bringing a halt to the fighting will require the United States , the European Union , Russia , Iran , and possibly Saudi Arabia and Qatar to work together toward a common goal . 
In order to achieve results in the future , international coalitions will have to be broader , more inclusive , and more representative of the interests of all . 
Today , a variety of strategic &quot; poles &quot; is available , each with the capacity to attract and influence . 
In this multipolar context , unilateral action will increasingly fail to achieve its objectives . 
If the negotiations so far had recognized this and been conducted with more tenacity , the conflict in Syria could have been resolved long ago , averting much death and destruction . 
For Europe , Syria &apos;s meltdown should serve as a wakeup call . 
The difficulties presented there are not confined to the chronically unstable Middle East , and Europe must confront the situation immediately . 
But the European pole &apos;s power of attraction is waning . 
Even as the EU continues to struggle with economic malaise , it finds itself in the midst of a growing geopolitical maelstrom , with crises in Ukraine , Russia , North Africa , and the Middle East each presenting important challenges . 
The EU needs to acknowledge that it is no longer the center around which its neighbors revolve . 
As Stefan Lehne , a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe , recently put it , Europe is undergoing a Copernican revolution . 
The reality of a multipolar world is that other players can attract and influence . 
For example , China is working to restore the last stretch of the old Silk Road to reach the ports of the Mediterranean . 
That stretch passes through the Balkans . 
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has asked the new commissioner for regional policy , Johannes Hahn , to make recommendations aimed at redefining the European Neighborhood Policy , the framework through which the EU relates to its immediate geopolitical environment . 
The policy needs a complete overhaul . 
It no longer makes sense to apply a single standard . 
The EU &apos;s offer is no longer unique , and faces competition from other frameworks for integration , other actors , and myriad strategic opportunities . 
In this context , it may be equally important to consider the neighbors of Europe &apos;s neighbors . 
Conditionality has plainly failed to deliver the intended results , because , ultimately , its success depends on countries &quot; willingness to accept the European agenda . 
Countries that are considered strategically important will require more attention and more commitment . 
International politics is witnessing exceptional and far-reaching change . 
Unless multipolarity is met with an efficient multilateral approach , problems like Syria &apos;s civil war will become much more frequent - and more difficult to resolve . 
Syria , and its largest city , is the perfect place to start seeking a better way .
