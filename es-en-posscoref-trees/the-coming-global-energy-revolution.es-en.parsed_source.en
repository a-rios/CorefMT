The Coming Global Energy Revolution 
PARIS - Humanity &apos;s future , to say nothing of its prosperity , will depend on how the world tackles two central energy challenges : securing reliable supplies of affordable energy , and switching to efficient low-carbon energy . 
The Reference Scenario - in which no new policies are introduced - in the International Energy Agency &apos;s 2008 World Energy Outlook sees annual global primary energy demand growing 1.6 % on average up to 2030 , from 11,730 million tons of oil equivalent ( Mtoe ) to just over 17,010 Mtoe - an increase of 45 % in just over 20 years . 
China and India account for just over half of this increase , with Middle East countries contributing a further 11 % to demand . 
Non-OECD countries account for 87 % of the increase , so their share of world primary energy demand will rise from 51 % to 62 % . 
Most oil production increases are expected to come from just a few countries - mainly in the Middle East , but also Canada with its vast oil-sands reserves , the Caspian region , and Brazil . 
Gas production in the Middle East will triple , and more than double in Africa , where there are large low-cost reserves . 
The trend by which consuming countries grow steadily more reliant on energy from a small number of producing countries threatens to exacerbate energy-security worries . 
The supply stand-off between Russia and Ukraine of 2009 made these worries crystal clear in Europe , where gas imports are set to rise to 86 % of demand by 2030 , from 57 % in 2006 . 
Of course , increasing import dependence does not necessarily mean less energy security , any more than self-sufficiency guarantees uninterrupted supply . 
Yet greater short-term insecurity seems inevitable as geographic diversity of supply is reduced and reliance on vulnerable supply routes grows . 
Longer-term energy-security risks are also set to grow . 
As a small group of countries increasingly accounts for the world &apos;s remaining oil reserves , their market dominance may threaten the pace of investment . 
The greater the demand for oil and gas from these regions , the more likely these regions are to seek higher prices , and to maintain them by deferring investment and limiting production . 
Unfettered growth in energy demand will clearly have serious consequences for the climate as well . 
Under the Reference Scenario , which represents &quot; business as usual , &quot; the IEA points to continuing growth in CO2 and other greenhouse-gas emissions ; 
Three-quarters of the extra CO2 will come from China , India , and the Middle East , and as much as 97 % from non-OECD countries as a whole - although non-OECD per capita emissions will still be far lower on average than in the OECD . 
Bucking the global trend , only the European Union and Japan will see lower emissions in 2030 than today . 
The energy sector has a relatively slow rate of capital replacement because of the long lifetimes of much of its infrastructure . 
More efficient technologies normally take many years to spread through the energy sector . 
As a result , both the public and private sectors must accept the need for additional investments , as well as the potential costs of early capital retirement , in order to accelerate this process and deliver deep cuts in emissions . 
Two IEA climate-policy scenarios show how we could stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases at 550 or 450 parts per million of CO2 equivalent . 
The 550 scenario equates to an increase in global temperature of approximately 3 ° C , while the 450 scenario implies an increase of around 2 ° C. 
In the 550 scenario , energy demand up to 2030 rises by about 32 % , with the share of fossil fuels falling markedly , and average demand up 1.2 % yearly , compared to 1.6 % in the Reference Scenario . 
Energy-related CO2 emissions would peak in 2025 and decline slightly by 2030 . 
The 450 scenario presents an immense challenge . 
The 2030 emissions level for the entire world would be less than the emissions projected for non-OECD countries alone in the Reference Scenario . 
In other words , even if OECD countries reduce their emissions to zero , they alone could not put the world onto the 450-ppm trajectory . 
To do so would mean a technology shift that - in terms of scale and speed of deployment - is unprecedented . 
The good news is that we already know many of the policies and technologies that can deliver substantial savings in energy consumption and CO2 emissions . 
But making and implementing the right decisions must begin now . 
We &apos;re talking about significant changes in the pattern of investment across the supply and demand chains , as well as huge additional spending on new capital stock , especially in power plants and in more energy-efficient equipment and appliances . 
Although the sheer scale of the transformation means placing a substantial burden on both the public private and sectors , the current financial crisis should be used as an opportunity rather than a barrier for launching it . 
Renewable energy will have a major role to play . 
Global renewables-based electricity generation ( mainly hydro and wind , but also solar and biomass ) is set to double between 2006 and 2030 . 
In the EU , wind &apos;s share in total power generation is set to rise to 14 % by 2030 , from 2 % today , and would account for well over half the total increase in the EU power generation . 
In the 450 scenario , renewables comprise 30 % of the EU power-generation mix in 2030 , up sharply from 10 % today . 
Governments must galvanize this transformation . 
Clear price signals , including carbon pricing , are crucial , and many non-OECD countries , in addition to needing financial support to help reduce their greenhouse gas emissions , can benefit from the removal of fuel subsidies . 
But clear price signals are not enough , as a low-carbon future requires major breakthroughs in technology development and deployment . 
Governments can create incentives to innovate , encourage research , and break down international barriers . 
And much of the additional spending needs be made by households , driven by a profound change in social attitudes to energy efficiency .
