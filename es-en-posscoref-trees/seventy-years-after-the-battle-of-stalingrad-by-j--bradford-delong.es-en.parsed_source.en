Our Debt to Stalingrad 
BERKELEY - We are not newly created , innocent , rational , and reasonable beings . 
We are not created fresh in an unmarked Eden under a new sun . 
We are , instead , the products of hundreds of millions of years of myopic evolution , and thousands of years of unwritten and then recorded history . 
Our past has built up layer upon layer of instincts , propensities , habits of thought , patterns of interaction , and material resources . 
On top of this historical foundation , we build our civilization . 
Were it not for our history , our labor would not just be in vain ; it would be impossible . 
And there are the crimes of human history . 
The horrible crimes . 
The unbelievable crimes . 
Our history grips us like a nightmare , for the crimes of the past scar the present and induce yet more crimes in the future . 
And there are also the efforts to stop and undo the effects of past crimes . 
So it is appropriate this month to write not about economics , but about something else . 
Seventy-nine years ago , Germany went mad . 
There was delinquency . 
There was also history and bad luck . 
The criminals are almost all dead now . 
Their descendants and successors in Germany have done - and are doing - better than anyone could have expected at grappling with and mastering the nation &apos;s unmasterable past . 
Seventy years ago , 200,000 Soviet soldiers - overwhelmingly male and predominantly Russian - crossed the Volga River to the city of Stalingrad . 
As members of Vasily Chuikov &apos;s 62nd Army , they grabbed hold of the nose of the Nazi army and did not let go . 
For five months , they fought . 
And perhaps 80 % of them died in the ruins of the city . 
On October 15 - a typical day - Chuikov &apos;s battle diary records that a radio message was received from the 416th Regiment at 12 : 20 PM : &quot; Have been encircled , ammunition and water available , death before surrender ! &quot; 
At 4 : 35 PM , Lieutenant Colonel Ustinov called down the artillery on his own encircled command post . 
But they held on . 
And so , 70 years ago this November - on November 19 to be precise - the million-soldier reserve of the Red Army was transferred to General Nikolai Vatutin &apos;s Southwestern Front , Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky &apos;s Don Front , and Marshal Andrei Yeremenko &apos;s Stalingrad Front . 
They went on to spring the trap of Operation Uranus , the code name for the planned encirclement and annihilation of the German Sixth Army and Fourth Panzer Army . 
They would fight , die , win , and thus destroy the Nazi hope of dominating Eurasia for even one more year - let alone of establishing Hitler &apos;s 1,000-year Reich . 
Together , these 1.2 million Red Army soldiers , the workers who armed them , and the peasants who fed them turned the Battle of Stalingrad into the fight that , of any battle in human history , has made the greatest positive difference for humanity . 
The Allies probably would have eventually won World War II even had the Nazis conquered Stalingrad , redistributed their spearhead forces as mobile reserves , repelled the Red Army &apos;s subsequent winter 1942 offensive , and seized the Caucasus oil fields , thus depriving the Red Army of 90 % of its motor fuel . 
But any Allied victory would have required the large-scale use of nuclear weapons , and a death toll in Europe that would most likely have been twice the actual World War II death toll of perhaps 40 million . 
May there never be another such battle . 
May we never need another one . 
The soldiers of the Red Army , and the workers and peasants of the Soviet Union who armed and fed them , allowed their dictatorial masters to commit crimes - and committed crimes themselves . 
But these crimes fall short by an order of magnitude of the great service to humanity - and especially to western European humanity - that they gave in the rubble along the Volga River 70 years ago this fall . 
We are the heirs to their accomplishments . 
We are their debtors . 
And we cannot repay what we owe to them . 
We can only remember it . 
But how many NATO leaders or European Union presidents and prime ministers have ever taken the time to visit the battle site , and perhaps lay a wreath to those whose sacrifice saved their civilization ?
