The Real Route to Democracy at the IMF 
Emerging market countries from Chile to China have been arguing for some time that the International Monetary Fund - the nerve center of the international financial system ­ - needs to become more &quot; democratic . &quot; 
They want more policy influence the next time the Fund decides to bail out a fellow emerging-market country like Argentina , Brazil , Indonesia , and Turkey . 
In the meantime , as a new &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; of best-practice economic policies inevitably emerges , developing countries want to feel that they helped design it , for better or worse . 
I couldn &apos;t agree more . 
The IMF &apos;s perceived &quot; democratic deficit &quot; is a serious challenge to the Fund &apos;s political legitimacy and to its ability to effectively stabilize crisis situations . 
But let &apos;s recognize that real democracy is only going to come when middle-income developing countries are prepared to back up their lofty rhetoric with hard cash . 
Right now is precisely the time to do so , given that the United States has become , without rival , the world &apos;s most reckless borrower . 
The US is draining a whopping 75 % of the world &apos;s surplus savings . 
Today , even formerly bankrupt governments from Korea to Russia to Mexico are awash in dollars . 
Why not put some of those dollars to good use ? 
These countries need to understand that calls to cut rich-country voting shares at the IMF , unless they are backed up by real money , are naïve , if not downright hypocritical . 
At the end of the day , as long as the IMF is in the lending business , it needs to keep its creditors happy . 
Otherwise , they will pull up stakes , and the Fund ( and its sister organization , the World Bank ) will have a debt crisis of its own . 
Right now , the US , Europe , and Japan put up the lion &apos;s share of the capital , so they have disproportionate power . 
It doesn &apos;t have to be this way . 
Many middle-income countries &quot; central banks are hoarding dollars today in order to prevent their currencies from appreciating too much against the sinking dollar . 
China alone , with over $ 600 billion in reserves , holds more than enough dollars to recapitalize the IMF four times over . 
Even Latin American governments now hold enough dollar reserve assets to buy out Europe &apos;s shares in the Fund . 
It may seem strange to make middle-income countries pay for their own bailout insurance , but it isn &apos;t . 
They have much more at stake in IMF policies than do rich countries . 
Many people have forgotten that the Fund was originally conceived as a cooperative - it bailed out England only a few decades ago , and almost had to bail out France . 
People forget these episodes because the Fund &apos;s resources have not kept pace with the explosion of global capital markets so that today , the IMF lacks the capacity to bail out an Italy or a Japan ( though the issue may well arise one day . ) 
So , if the Fund is to resume its identity as a cooperative , it makes sense to shift its center of gravity . 
Would middle-income developing countries actually change things if they were big creditors at the Fund ? 
I wonder . 
Admittedly , no developing country ever seems to vote against a big bailout for one of its brethren , no matter how ill conceived . 
But would such indiscriminate largesse persist if middle-income countries knew that their votes really counted , and that they were spending their own money ? 
I doubt it . 
On the whole , I expect that the bailout policies of a more &quot; democratic &quot; IMF would look much as they do now . 
After all , the laws of economics are always going to force prodigal debtor countries into adopting austerity measures . 
If a country that has been borrowing like a drunk suddenly sees its credit dry up , it will tighten its belt - raise taxes , cut spending , or do both - with or without an international lender of last resort . 
Perhaps the IMF &apos;s bedside manners would improve , perhaps not . 
In any case , greater political legitimacy would likely make the Fund &apos;s crisis leadership smoother and more credible , potentially shortening crises and minimizing their pain . 
The big question is whether the rich countries that have long ruled the roost at the Fund would actually surrender some of their power . 
They might , and they should , even if global financial markets take time to adjust to a slightly smaller role for the dollar . 
They really have little to lose and much to gain . 
So there is an upside to today &apos;s massive US fiscal and current account deficits . 
The structure of global imbalances , with the US the big borrower and emerging markets the creditors , presents a rare opportunity to finance a change in governance at the IMF . 
Let &apos;s do it now before the chance slips away when the next round of crises hits .
