Imperialism Reclaimed 
LONDON - History has no final verdicts . 
Major shifts in events and power bring about new subjects for discussion and new interpretations . 
Fifty years ago , as de-colonization accelerated , no one had a good word to say for imperialism . 
It was regarded as unambiguously bad , both by ex-imperialists and by their liberated subjects . 
Schoolchildren were taught about the horrors of colonialism , how it exploited conquered peoples . 
There was little mention , if any , of imperialism &apos;s benefits . 
Then , in the 1980 &quot; s , a revisionist history came along . 
It wasn &apos;t just that distance lends a certain enchantment to any view . 
The West - mainly the Anglo-American part of it - had recovered some of its pride and nerve under US President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . 
But the decisive event for the revisionists was the collapse of the Soviet empire , which not only left the United States top dog globally , but also seemed , to the more philosophically minded , to vindicate Western civilization and values against all other civilizations and values . 
With the European Union extending its frontiers to embrace many ex-communist states , the West became again , if briefly , the embodiment of universal reason , obliged and equipped to spread its values to the still-benighted parts of the world . 
Francis Fukuyama &apos;s The End of History and the Last Man testified to this sense of triumph and historical duty . 
Such a conjuncture set the stage for a new wave of imperialism ( though the reluctance to use the word remained ) . 
In doing so , it was bound to affect interpretations of the old imperialism , which was now extolled for spreading economic progress , the rule of law , and science and technology to countries that would never have benefited from them otherwise . 
Foremost among the new generation of revisionist historians was Niall Ferguson of Harvard University , whose television series , based on his new book Civilization : The West and the Rest , has just started showing in Britain . 
In its first episode , Ferguson appears amid the splendid monuments of China &apos;s Ming Dynasty , which , in the fifteenth century , was undoubtedly the greatest civilization of the day , with its naval expeditions reaching the coasts of Africa . 
After that , it was all downhill for China ( and &quot; the Rest &quot; ) and all uphill for the West . 
Ferguson snazzily summarizes the reasons for this reversal in six &quot; killer apps &quot; : competition , science , property rights , medicine , the consumer society , and the work ethic . 
Against such tools - unique products of Western civilization - the rest had no chance . 
From such a perspective , imperialism , old and new , has been a beneficent influence , because it has been the means of spreading these &quot; apps &quot; to the rest of the world , thereby enabling them to enjoy the fruits of progress hitherto confined to a few Western countries . 
Understandably , this thesis has not met with universal approbation . 
The historian Alex von Tunzelmann accused Ferguson of leaving out all of imperialism &apos;s nasty bits : the Black War in Australia , the German genocide in Namibia , the Belgian exterminations in the Congo , the Amritsar Massacre , the Bengal Famine , the Irish potato famine , and much else . 
But that is the weakest line of attack . 
Edward Gibbon once described history as being little better than a record of the &quot; crimes , follies , and misfortunes of mankind . &quot; 
Imperialism certainly added its quota to these . 
Even Marx justified British rule in India on these grounds . 
Ferguson , too , can make a sound argument for such a proposition . 
The most serious weakness in Ferguson &apos;s presentation is his lack of sympathy for the civilizations dismissed as &quot; the rest , &quot; which also points to the most serious limitation of the revisionist case . 
The &quot; triumph of the West &quot; that followed the collapse of Communism in Europe was clearly not the &quot; end of history . &quot; 
As Ferguson must know , the main topic of discussion in international affairs nowadays concerns the &quot; rise &quot; of China , and more generally Asia , as well as the stirring of Islam . 
Of course , the Chinese may prefer to talk about &quot; restoration &quot; rather than &quot; rise , &quot; and point to a &quot; harmonious &quot; pluralism of the future . 
In other words , we may be reverting to that cyclical pattern that historians assumed to be axiomatic before the seemingly irreversible rise of the West implanted in them a view of linear progress toward greater reason and freedom . 
Europe is plainly in decline , politically and culturally , though most Europeans , blinded by their high living standards and the pretensions of their impotent statesmen , are happy to dress this up as progress . 
Chinese savings are underwriting much of the American civilizing mission that Ferguson applauds . 
The pattern seems clear : the West is losing dynamism , and the rest are gaining it . 
The remainder of this century will show how this shift plays out . 
For the moment , most of us have lost the historical plot . 
It is possible , for example , to imagine a &quot; Western world &quot; ( one that applies Ferguson &apos;s &quot; killer apps &quot; ) in which the actual West is no longer the dominant factor : America will simply passes the torch to China , as Britain once did to America . 
But it seems to me extremely unlikely that China , India , and &quot; the rest &quot; will simply take over Western values wholesale , for this would amount to renouncing any value in their own civilizations . 
Some syntheses and accommodations between the West and the rest will inevitably accompany the shift in power and wealth from the former to the latter . 
The only question is whether the process will be peaceful .
