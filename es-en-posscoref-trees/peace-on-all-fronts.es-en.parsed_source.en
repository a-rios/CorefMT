Peace On All Fronts ? 
JERUSALEM - Not since the collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks during President Bill Clinton &apos;s last days in the White House has the Middle East seen such a frenetic pace of peace diplomacy as it is seeing today . 
A cease-fire has been brokered between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip , Israel and Syria have started peace negotiations , and Israel has offered Lebanon a chance to resolve the issues that block a bilateral settlement . 
Less dramatic perhaps , yet persistent nonetheless , are the peace talks between Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s Palestinian Authority . 
So is the Middle East at the gates of a lasting , comprehensive peace ? 
Not quite . 
Aside from the Annapolis talks , which seem to be going nowhere because of the parties &quot; irreconcilable differences over the core issues , all the other peace efforts are more tactical than strategic . 
In none of them do the conditions yet exist for an immediate leap from war to peace , nor do the parties themselves expect that to happen . 
It would require bold statesmanship to turn the cease-fire with Hamas into a prelude to political talks . 
Indeed , both Israel and the United States are adamant about excluding Hamas from the Annapolis process unless and until it recognizes Israel &apos;s right to exist , while Hamas will not abandon its identity as a resistance movement merely to join negotiations that seem unlikely to satisfy the Palestinian people &apos;s minimal requirements . 
For Israel , the cease-fire with Hamas reflects its reluctance to become mired in another asymmetric war like the one it fought in Lebanon two summers ago , this time in the alleys of Gaza &apos;s refugee camps . 
Ehud Olmert , an especially unpopular prime minister whose days leading the government are probably numbered , lacks the legitimacy to throw the country into another bloody war , which given conditions in Gaza would be both costly and inconclusive . 
Israel &apos;s leaders believe that the day of reckoning with Hamas will come only when the conditions for a major military showdown are riper . 
The Syrian track - requiring Israel &apos;s withdrawal from the strategically vital Golan Heights and the evacuation of tens of thousand of settlers - is hampered not only by the Israeli leadership &apos;s legitimacy deficit , but also by US opposition to the talks . 
For the Syrians , the major objective in concluding peace with Israel is rapprochement with the US , but they will balk at the Americans &quot; demand that they stop flirting with terrorism as a precondition for talks . 
In fact , it is doubtful that they will ever agree to this . 
As Buthaina Shaaban , a Syrian minister , put it , &quot; To demand that Syria forsake Hamas and Hezbollah is like demanding that the United States forsake Israel . &quot; 
The US has been absent from Middle East peacemaking for too long . 
Indeed , for the first time in the history of its special relationship with Israel , America is not speaking to Israel &apos;s enemies , be they Syria , Iran , Hamas , or Hezbollah . 
As a result , Israel , embattled and facing a gathering storm of regional threats , had to find its own way to talk , without the diplomatic assistance of its big brother . 
The demarche with Lebanon , to which US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice devoted most of her recent surprise visit to Beirut , has much to do with America &apos;s desperate attempt to revive its role as the main regional peace broker . 
After all , it was tiny Qatar that brokered Lebanon &apos;s domestic settlement , Egypt that mediated the Gaza cease-fire , and Turkey that is facilitating the Israeli-Syrian talks . 
Israel &apos;s shift in policy towards Syria , and that of French President Nicolas Sarkozy , was a powerful message to the Americans that they should not miss the Lebanese train as well . 
But America &apos;s dwindling leverage cannot match the influence of the region &apos;s &quot; axis of evil . &quot; 
Lebanon is too vulnerable to pressure from Syria and Iran , neither of which wants to see their local clients relieve the Israelis of the burden of a &quot; Lebanese front &quot; before their own grievances are addressed . 
Nor is Hezbollah keen to see the end of Israel &apos;s occupation of the Sheba Farms on the Lebanon border undermine its claim to the formidable independent military force that it has built with Iranian and Syrian help . 
Tactical moves , however , can always develop into strategic shifts . 
The Gaza cease-fire should be allowed to facilitate reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas , which would make the Annapolis process more legitimate and inclusive . 
It was none other than the Hamas spokesman in Gaza , Salah al-Bardawil , who defined the cease-fire as &quot; a historic opportunity for all the sides involved to live in peace , and to build a future for the next generations . &quot; 
Nor are the other peace tracks - Lebanon , Syria , and maybe also Iran - doomed to permanent failure . 
But their success , so urgently needed to save the region from the politics of Doomsday , will have to wait for a new US administration to inject into them the necessary balance of realism and idealism , military power tempered by a genuine commitment to diplomacy .
