An Afghan Homecoming 
KABUL - As if the armed conflict between Afghan government forces supported by the American-led coalition and the Taliban were not enough , Afghanistan is faced with a crisis that it wishes it could call a success : the Big Return . 
From Jalalabad to Herat - indeed , all over northern Afghanistan - you can see the signs of Afghans returning from exile . 
The scale of the displacement was enormous : at the height of the exodus , up to six million Afghans were living outside their country , mainly in Pakistan and Iran . 
Roughly three-quarters of them fled after the Soviet invasion in 1979 , with smaller numbers escaping the rule of pro-Soviet president Najibullah or the subsequent 1992-1996 civil war between the various mujahideen parties and then the rule of the Taliban . 
Some - having supported the Taliban - fled after their leaders were ousted when the Northern Alliance entered Kabul in November 2001 . 
Since then , more than 3.5 million Afghan refugees have already come home . 
Yet those still remaining beyond Afghanistan &apos;s borders are the biggest &quot; caseload &quot; of refugees in the world , and there are many Afghan migrants , too , especially in Iran . 
Pakistan is home to most remaining Afghan refugees , perhaps as many as 1.9 million . 
When a registration of all Afghan refugees in Pakistan was carried out in 2007 , almost half of them were living in camps . 
Three decades after being established , these &quot; camps &quot; are now villages of mud-plastered houses with high walls around the compounds . 
Since three-quarters of the refugees are under the age of 28 , most have never seen their parents &quot; homeland . 
They were born and raised in Pakistan , and most speak only Pashto , one of the two official Afghan languages . 
Pashto is spoken by the tribes on both sides of the Durand Line , the border drawn at the end of the nineteenth century by the British colonial rulers of India . 
Despite these ethnic ties , and despite having hosted them for 30 years , Pakistan does not officially allow Afghans to integrate locally . 
They have no prospects for citizenship , no work permits , and no access to public health and education . 
So their only good choice is &quot; return . &quot; 
The frontier region between Pakistan and Afghanistan is the main theater of the &quot; war on terror . &quot; 
Here one finds Tora Bora , the last known home address of Osama bin Laden . 
The area &apos;s volatile situation provides Pakistan &apos;s government an additional argument to insist that all refugees be repatriated - because , given their complicated tribal loyalties , they may constitute a domestic security threat . 
According to tripartite agreements between the governments of Pakistan , Afghanistan , and the United Nations &quot; refugee agency , UNHCR , four of the largest camps in Pakistan are to be closed and all Afghans living there repatriated . 
While in theory the repatriation should be safe and voluntary , the reality is different . 
Return is often dangerous , and the fact that alternative locations are almost uninhabitable means it is an induced choice . 
After much negotiation , Pakistani authorities agreed to a compromise . 
One camp - Katcha Ghari is already closed and in 2008 , only the biggest of the remaining camps - Jalozai , which once had 110,000 inhabitants - would be closed . 
A few days after the deadline of April 15 , bulldozers moved in , flattening the shops , previously dismantled by the departing Afghan merchants . 
Returns from Pakistan were at 20,000 persons a week at the beginning of May 2008 and of the 70.000 Afghans who returned since the beginning of the year until end of May , over 50,000 came from Jalozai camp , according to UNHCR data . 
But unless officials of all the countries involved , including the United States , admit that Afghanistan is dangerous and unprepared to absorb the Big Return , they cannot start taking steps to remedy the situation and guarantee that repatriations will be both safe and voluntary .
