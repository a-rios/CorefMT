The Good Fallout from Iraq 
Reconciling morals with how a society is organized - in other words , reconciling ethics with politics - is one of humanity &apos;s oldest ambitions . 
Hammurabi , Raamses II , Solon , Confucius , and Pericles were among the first great figures to embark on this effort . 
The emergence of the nation-state in the eighteenth century , and the extreme level of barbarism reached in the twentieth century , may have created the impression that an ethical politics was an unrealizable dream , or that it was a dream growing ever more distant as it receded into the future . 
Yet , despite the rivalry of nations and the bloodiness of modern warfare , democracy is spreading . 
Indeed , in but half a century , Latin Americans rid themselves of all of that continent &apos;s military and civilian dictatorships , and Africa has eliminated more than half of the despots that have blighted its era of independence . 
Compared with all the other political regimes known to mankind , democracy represents ethical progress twice over : first , because it is based on respect for human rights ; and secondly , because the universal suffrage that modern democracy embraces prohibits neglecting or oppressing minorities . 
Of course , progress towards more democracy and morality in international public affairs remains extremely slow . 
Yet the year 2004 may leave to history some of the greatest progress in this area that humanity has seen . 
Signs of hope and progress abound . 
A Spanish government was overthrown because it lied to its public about the origin of the terrorist bombs that ripped apart Madrid &apos;s train station last spring . 
Tony Blair and George W. Bush are having huge problems with their electorates , also because they lied about the reasons they gave to justify their war in Iraq . 
Democracy is alive and well in the developing world , too . 
The electoral process in Indonesia is reaching a level of equity and accountability hitherto unknown in that country . 
Morocco and Algeria are working to strengthen women &apos;s rights . 
Turkey has committed itself to a vast legislative effort to improve human rights , freedom of thought , treatment of prisoners , and civilian control over the military . 
Even China , though highly insensitive to democratic principles , is discovering , with the dangerous spread of AIDS , an obligation to listen to popular clamor , and the need for public support to justify government actions . 
The US , owing to its horrific treatment and torture of prisoners in Baghdad , has had no option but to search for international legitimacy after denying and defying it for so long , in order to extricate itself from the chaos and drama of what is now Iraq . 
Israel has seen both the legitimacy of its &quot; security wall , &quot; as well as the wall &apos;s proposed path through Palestinian territory , called into question - differently , but in a parallel manner - by both its own Supreme Court and by the International Court of Justice in The Hague . 
Israel will not be able to ignore completely the rulings of either court . 
In replacing the Organization of African Unity with the African Union , Africa , for its part , is making a huge effort to control conflict on the continent , as well as to spread observance of human rights and pursue the struggle against poverty . 
Moreover , capitalism itself is feeling pressure in every direction . 
It sees ever increasing anger against bloated payments to bosses , risky speculation , and outright fraud . 
The creation of the International Criminal Court strengthens all of these efforts to bring abuses of power by the powerful to book . 
So , despite the Iraq war and the seeming impotence of world institutions , the beginning of the twenty-first century could well bring faster global improvement in political ethics than at any time in the past . 
States must begin to explain their toughest actions , those deeds that the search for security and the inevitable mistrust among states make necessary . 
&quot; Reason of State &quot; will not disappear entirely .
