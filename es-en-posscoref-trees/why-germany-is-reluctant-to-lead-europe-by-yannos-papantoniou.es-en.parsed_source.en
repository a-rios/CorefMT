Bismarck versus Bismarck 
ATHENS - The centrality of Germany to Europe and , more widely , to world affairs has been amply , and often bloodily , demonstrated over many centuries . 
Indeed , Germany &apos;s strategic position at the heart of Europe , as well as its huge economic and military potential , made it first a prize to be sought , and then , following Otto von Bismarck &apos;s completion of German unification in 1871 , a nation-state to be feared . 
Bismarck &apos;s legacy was a Germany that dominated European politics until the end of World War II . 
That legacy is now reasserting itself . 
After the interlude of the Cold War , during which Germany served as the center of discord between East and West , reunification permitted the reassertion of German power within the context of the European Union and , most notably , the eurozone . 
Today , however , the question is whether Germany is ready and willing to provide leadership in the conduct of the EU &apos;s affairs - and , if so , to what end . 
Europe is currently facing its most challenging crisis of the postwar period . 
After six quarters of recession , the slump is spreading to the eurozone &apos;s core countries . 
Unemployment , above 12 % on average , is at a record high . 
In Spain and Greece , more than one-quarter of the labor force is jobless , while the unemployment rate hovers around 60 % among young people . 
Despite harsh austerity , large fiscal deficits persist , and banks remain undercapitalized and unable to support a sustained economic recovery . 
Social malaise is deepening as expectations - and actual prospects - for economic improvement are likely to remain poor for the foreseeable future . 
Faith in the European project is declining , and , given the eurozone &apos;s lack of cohesion , stagnation and recession may lead to popular rejection of the EU , accompanied by serious challenges to democracy , including the rise of neo-fascist parties . 
And yet , despite the risks , European leaders remain remarkably inactive , apparently reassured by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s promise to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to protect the monetary union from collapse . 
But prolonged inaction , induced by relative calm in financial markets , will perpetuate stagnation and eventually lead to a breakup of one sort or another . 
Either gradual attrition , with weaker countries defaulting , will lead to a more restricted German-led club of &quot; virtuous &quot; countries , or Germany itself will choose to pursue a policy of narrow fiscal advantage by seceding from the eurozone . 
The political and economic weakness of France and Italy , together with Britain &apos;s gradual withdrawal from EU affairs , highlight Germany &apos;s key role in rescuing the eurozone from the current crisis . 
But true leadership requires a sense of direction and a willingness to pay up , and , here , Germany has lately been found wanting . 
Despite German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s evident political skills and high domestic standing , her government lacks a concrete design for &quot; ever closer Union &quot; in Europe . 
As a result , it , too , is in a weak position to mobilize the resources and competences required to restore Europe . 
Instead , Merkel &apos;s Germany has been doing as little as possible , as late as possible , to prevent the euro &apos;s collapse . 
This policy cannot endure for long . 
Either stagnation will lead to the eurozone &apos;s breakup , or circumstances will force a policy change . 
So , in which areas must Germany lead ? 
First , European public debt should be partly and gradually mutualized . 
National banking systems should be unified , in order to separate private losses from sovereign debt , with centralized supervision and resolution authorities , as well as a deposit-insurance scheme , forming the core of a European banking union . 
Strong central institutions , responsible to a directly elected parliament , are needed to coordinate fiscal and economic policies . 
In the shorter term , the single market should be extended to services , and free-trade arrangements should be promoted either multilaterally or bilaterally with major trading partners such as the United States . 
Austerity should be eased , particularly in the fiscally stronger core economies , and substantial resources should be devoted to boosting youth employment and investment in small and medium-size firms in the over-indebted countries . 
Germany &apos;s reluctance to lead on these issues partly reflects historical inhibitions , which are always difficult to overcome . 
The persistence of pre-Keynesian orthodoxy in German economic thought , with its moral abhorrence of the &quot; sin of borrowing &quot; ( and thus its neglect of aggregate demand ) , does not help , either . 
The federalist structure of Germany &apos;s political system , moreover , favors parochial approaches over grander designs . 
Nonetheless , Germany must accept that the alternative to a democratically unified currency union is German economic hegemony . 
In the longer run , that outcome would destroy the common European project , in turn undermining Germany &apos;s own economic prosperity and strategic security - a Bismarckian scenario from which Bismarck would have recoiled in horror .
