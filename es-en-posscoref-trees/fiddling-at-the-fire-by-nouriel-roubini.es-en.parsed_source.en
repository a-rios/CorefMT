Fiddling at the Fire 
PARIS - Financial markets have rallied since July on the hope that the global economic and geopolitical outlook will not worsen , or , if it does , that central banks stand ready to backstop economies and markets with additional rounds of liquidity provision and quantitative easing . 
So , not only has good - or better-than-expected - economic news boosted the markets , but even bad news has been good news , because it increases the probability that central-banking firefighters like US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will douse the markets with buckets of cash . 
But markets that rise on both good and bad news are not stable markets . 
&quot; Risk-off &quot; episodes , in which investor sentiment sours , are likely to return if economic news worsens and confidence in policymakers &quot; effectiveness drops . 
In the eurozone , euphoria followed the ECB &apos;s decision to provide support with potentially unlimited purchases of distressed countries &quot; bonds . 
And the policy challenges are daunting : the eurozone &apos;s recession is deepening as front-loaded fiscal consolidation and severe credit rationing continues . 
And , as eurozone banks and public-debt markets become increasingly balkanized , establishing a banking union , a fiscal union , and an economic union while pursuing macroeconomic policies that restore growth , external balance , and competitiveness will be extremely difficult . 
Even the ECB &apos;s support is not obvious . 
Monetary hawks - the Bundesbank and several other core central banks - who were worried about a new open-ended ECB mandate pushed successfully for strict and effective conditionality for countries benefiting from the bond purchases . 
As a result , they can pull the plug on the program if its stringent criteria are not met . 
Moreover , Greece could exit the eurozone in 2013 , before Spain and Italy are successfully ring-fenced ; 
Spain - like Greece - is spiraling into depression , and may need a full-scale bailout by the &quot; troika &quot; ( the ECB , the European Commission , and the International Monetary Fund ) . 
Meanwhile , austerity fatigue in the eurozone periphery is increasingly clashing with bailout fatigue in the core . 
Small wonder , then , that Germany , politically unable to vote on more bailout resources , has outsourced that job to the ECB , the only institution that can bypass democratically elected parliaments . 
In the United States , the latest economic data - including a weak labor market - confirm that growth is anemic , with output in the second half of 2012 unlikely to be significantly stronger than the 1.6 % annual gain recorded in January-June . 
On the contrary , we should expect agreement only on the path of least political resistance : avoidance of tough fiscal choices until the bond vigilantes eventually wake up , spike long rates , and force fiscal adjustment on the political system . 
In China , a hard economic landing looks increasingly likely as the investment bubble deflates and net exports shrink . 
Meanwhile , the reforms necessary to reduce savings and increase private consumption are being delayed . 
As in Europe and the US , the worst will be avoided in 2012 only by kicking the can down the road with more monetary , fiscal , and credit stimulus . 
But a hard landing becomes more likely in 2013 , as the stimulus fades , non-performing loans rise , the investment bust accelerates , and the problem of rolling over the debts of provincial governments and their special investment vehicles can no longer be papered over . 
Meanwhile , Brazil , India , Russia , and other emerging economies are playing the same game . 
Many have not adjusted as advanced economies &quot; weakness reduces the room for export-led growth ; and many delayed structural reforms needed to boost private-sector development and productivity growth , while embracing a model of state capitalism that will soon reveal its limits . 
So the recent slowdown of growth in emerging markets is not just cyclical , owing to weak growth or outright recession in advanced economies ; it is also structural . 
Similar dithering is apparent at the geopolitical level as well . 
The major global powers are still trying negotiations and sanctions to induce Iran to abandon its efforts to develop nuclear weapons . 
By 2013 , an Israel that - rightly or wrongly - perceives Iran &apos;s nuclear program to be an existential threat , and / or the US , which has rejected containment of a nuclear Iran , may decide to strike , leading to a war and a massive spike in oil prices . 
Ineffective governments with weak leadership are at the root of the problem . 
In democracies , repeated elections lead to short-term policy choices . 
In autocracies like China and Russia , leaders resist the radical reforms that would reduce the power of entrenched lobbies and interests , thereby fueling social unrest as resentment against corruption and rent-seeking boils over into protest . 
But , as everyone kicks the can down the road , the can is getting heavier and , in the major emerging markets and advanced economies alike , is approaching a brick wall . 
Policymakers can either crash into that wall , or they can show the leadership and vision needed to dismantle it safely .
