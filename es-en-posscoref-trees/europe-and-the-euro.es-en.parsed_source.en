Europe and the Euro 
PARIS - For anyone living in the 16 eurozone member states , the euro &apos;s enduring success is both a technical and an emotional issue ; both hearts and minds are involved . 
I consider it axiomatic that the euro is vital to Europe and , indeed , to the world economy . 
First of all , it should be recalled that the European idea began as a project for ensuring peace and democracy among Europe &apos;s peoples . 
When the new currency was introduced in 1999 - and even more so when European citizens had their first opportunity to use it in January 2002 - it was experienced as the most tangible , decisive proof that European integration was a reality . 
As the slogan goes : euro in your wallet , Europe in your pocket . 
Twenty years after the European Parliament was elected by universal suffrage in 1979 , the introduction of the euro marked a logical extension of the European dream . 
It should also be recalled , however , that when Slovenia entered the eurozone in 2007 , many people suggested that the country was somehow joining &quot; Old Europe . &quot; 
But Cyprus , Malta , and Slovakia have since followed suit in making the euro their currency . 
From Dublin on the shore of the Irish Sea to Bratislava in the foothills of the Carpathians , the same coins and banknotes are legal tender , and they are constantly pushing back the European Union &apos;s boundaries . 
Tomorrow will bring additional members , such as Estonia , which is slated to join the eurozone on January 1 , 2011 . 
Europe &apos;s &quot; Founding Fathers &quot; were right that &quot; Europe will not be made all at once , &quot; and neither will the euro . 
Our common currency should rather be viewed as an inspiring symbol - the symbol of a Europe that is vibrant , attractive , and , above all , cohesive . 
Just how cohesive Europe can be is something that we know from the experience of the past few months . 
The history of the euro , not surprisingly , has turned out to represent a further stage in the ongoing saga of a European economy that has been in a state of perpetual construction since the Treaty of Rome . 
The financial support provided to Greece ; the new European Financial Stability Facility , which we created to extend guarantees to eurozone member states in need ; and our efforts to achieve more effective financial regulation are among the latest illustrations of European cohesion in practice . 
Admittedly , the various crises affecting the eurozone have highlighted - sometimes starkly so - the need to reform our institutions and the way they operate . 
It has been argued that Europe &apos;s institutions move forward only in times of crisis . 
Perhaps the same is true of the single currency , which will derive strength and validation from the challenges that it overcomes . 
In the last few months , as it just barely emerged from the deepest economic and financial crisis in close to a century , the eurozone experienced the worst jolts in its history , although in terms of public finance , the eurozone as a whole has fared better than the United States or Japan . 
Once the extent of Greece &apos;s financial crisis and the difficulties encountered by other member states became known , the eurozone economies found themselves on the brink of disaster . 
But the EU reacted swiftly and forcefully , with a support program for Greece and a financial guarantee plan for the entire eurozone . 
In this state of emergency , a genuine European economic government , most compellingly advocated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy , began to take shape . 
Following the European Council meeting in June , France and Germany jointly outlined a number of possible reforms . 
Three key points emerged , concerning the need to : 
· strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact , notably through enhanced European coordination during a &quot; European Semester &quot; ; 
· maintain our efforts to expand the scope of economic surveillance to include government deficits and public as well as private-sector debt , if necessary by imposing &quot; political penalties &quot; ; 
· establish a credible crisis-resolution framework without encroaching on the budgetary prerogatives of member states . 
Other possible approaches are under consideration as well . 
But what they all share is the recognition that the time has clearly come to stabilize and institutionalize a European economic government . 
That process is already well under way . 
The European Commission has made proposals , and the working group chaired by European President Herman Van Rompuy , in which I represent France , will be submitting its own in the fall . 
We all expect that the euro , which proved to be such an asset during the crisis , will be just as effective in getting our economies back on the path to vigorous , sustainable growth . 
Indeed , according to Eurostat ( the EU &apos;s statistical office ) , by the second quarter of 2010 , the eurozone was growing faster than the US , while the euro remains the second most widely used trading currency . 
The euro , like the EU itself , is an exciting adventure that must continue - and we intend to make sure that it does .
