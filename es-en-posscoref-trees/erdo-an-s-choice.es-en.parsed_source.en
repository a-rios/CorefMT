Erdoğan &apos;s Choice 
ISTANBUL - &quot; Turkish democracy is at a turning point , &quot; Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced after winning a crucial vote in a referendum to change Turkey &apos;s constitution . 
&quot; We are sitting an important exam . &quot; 
Erdoğan is right , but it is he who must pass the test . 
If the plebiscite victory emboldens him and his allies to step up their tactics of judicial dirty tricks and media manipulation - used to great effect in recent years - the prospects for Turkey are bleak . 
The country will descend deeper into authoritarianism , political divisions will become irreconcilable , and yet another political rupture may become inevitable . 
Too few people in Europe and the United States comprehend the extent to which Erdoğan &apos;s government has undermined the rule of law and basic freedoms - all in the name of &quot; deepening Turkish democracy . &quot; 
Government prosecutors have mounted a series of sham trials , charging hundreds of military officers , academics , and journalists with membership in an armed terrorist organization aiming to topple the Erdoğan government . 
In a separate but related prosecution , they used fabricated evidence to accuse nearly 200 active and retired military officers of planning a coup in 2003 , during the early days of Erdoğan &apos;s first government . 
Erdoğan and his ministers have been cheerleaders for these prosecutions . 
Their supporters in the media have spewed a stream of disinformation and leaked wiretaps to discredit and embarrass the accused . 
Meanwhile , the country &apos;s largest independent media group has been brought to heel by huge , politically motivated tax fines . 
Erdoğan &apos;s strategy has been to whip up frenzy around these cases to solidify his traditional , religious / conservative base , but also to gain the backing of domestic liberals . 
The prosecutions have allowed him to position himself as the protector of Turkish democracy against the coup plotters allegedly still running rampant among the military and secularists . 
The prosecutions entail indictments that are thousands of pages long and include annexes that take up several bookshelves . 
This , along with media disinformation , has made it difficult for outsiders to penetrate the cases and separate fact from fiction . 
But as soon as we engage with the details of the prosecutions , a shocking picture emerges : some of the key evidence in the cases is clearly planted , while much of the rest remains circumstantial at best . 
For example , the alleged 2003 coup plot was supposedly discovered when CDs containing detailed preparations ( including assassination teams and plans to bomb two mosques ) were delivered to a virulently anti-military newspaper . 
Of the hundreds of senior officers serving at the time , none has acknowledged any knowledge of these plans . 
Indeed , it is patently clear that people intent on framing military officers authored the documents in question many years later , in 2008 at the earliest . 
In addition to major internal contradictions and inconsistencies , the coup plot documents are full of references to entities that did not even exist in 2003 , as well as to developments that took place later . 
The prosecutors have shown little interest in these discrepancies , doing their best to send the alleged conspirators to jail ( and keep them there ) even before the trial starts . 
Erdoğan has fanned the flames by claiming that he was aware of such coup plans at the time , but that he disregarded them . 
A dramatic book that was published just before the referendum on the constitution sheds light on who is behind these machinations . 
It claims that followers of Fethullah Gulen - the influential US-based spiritual leader - have effectively wrested control of the national police and large parts of the judiciary . 
The Gulen movement is independent from Erdoğan &apos;s Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , but the two have long been closely allied , and now it has become a state within a state , employing extra-legal means , including illegal wiretaps and fabricated evidence , to go after perceived opponents . 
Accusations against the Gulen movement are not new in Turkey , but what made the book a bombshell is that its author is a distinguished police chief , well known for his courage and incorruptibility - as well as his closeness to the Gulenists and to Erdoğan &apos;s government . 
No friend of the army , he pursued rogue elements within the military in a famous investigation several years ago . 
So he cannot be accused of harboring ultra-secularist or ultra-nationalist sympathies . 
This , along with his inside knowledge of the workings of the police and the prosecutorial branch , give his revelations a credibility that earlier accounts had lacked . 
Tellingly , the police chief went to his governmental superiors prior to the book &apos;s publication , appealing personally to a minister . 
But the government refused to investigate and did nothing with the information . 
The most benign explanation for this behavior is that it is a consequence of the AKP &apos;s own long history of persecution by the military and secular old guard . 
The AKP has been under constant threat of a ban through much of its existence , and Erdoğan was jailed for reciting a poem with religious imagery . 
Perhaps the dirty tricks are largely defensive , meant to ensure that the old guard never threatens the AKP &apos;s existence again . 
If so , the referendum &apos;s outcome should convince Erdoğan that the balance of power in the country has changed for good , and that the days of strong-arm tactics by the secular establishment are gone forever . 
Here is a chance for Erdoğan and his allies to back off from their gross violations of the rule of law and build the democracy that they so fervently claim as their goal . 
An important first step would be to restore confidence in the integrity and independence of the judiciary and law enforcement . 
The amended constitution expands the constitutional court and the supreme council of judges and prosecutors . 
The exam that the government must sit is to use its new powers to appoint widely-respected , impartial members - rather than divisive satraps - to these bodies .
