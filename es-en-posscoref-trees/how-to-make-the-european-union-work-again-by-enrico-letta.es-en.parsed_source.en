New Model Europe 
ROME - It is becoming increasingly clear that if Europe is to overcome its crisis , business as usual will not suffice . 
We need a Europe that is more concrete , less rhetorical , and better suited to the current global economy . 
We need to focus not only on the European Union &apos;s specific policies , but also on how to change its &quot; politics &quot; - a change that must place economic growth at the top of the agenda . 
Europe does not need a debate between austerity and growth ; it needs to be pragmatic . 
A good example of this was the most recent European Council , which addressed two of Europe &apos;s most pressing problems : malfunctioning labor markets , reflected in record-high youth unemployment , and malfunctioning credit markets , in which access to financing is difficult and lending rates vary considerably among different parts of the single market . 
The outcome of the Council &apos;s June meeting was encouraging , and we must continue on that path in the coming months to make progress on two equally important issues : how to foster innovation and the digital economy , and how to ensure Europe &apos;s manufacturing competitiveness . 
We need to assess what can be achieved at the national level and what EU institutions should do . 
Fiscal consolidation and national reforms are essential and should continue . 
But we can better achieve our objectives under an EU framework that supports , rather than impedes , national action to boost growth and employment . 
The European Commission &apos;s recent decision to grant member states some flexibility for productive public investment linked to EU structural funds is a welcome step in this direction . 
The second issue is the need to take further steps toward closer integration within the eurozone . 
A banking union is an important start , which should prevent financial markets from fragmenting along national lines and reduce private-sector borrowing costs . 
Lending rates are still too high for small and medium-size enterprises and too dependent on where in the EU a company is located . 
We have achieved important results on the way to a banking union , notably on supervision . 
Now we need to work on the second pillar , resolution of the banking crisis . 
The proposal presented by Michel Barnier , European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services , is bold , but Europe does indeed need a strong , efficient resolution mechanism that ensures timely action to address banking crises . 
We also need to consider how to enhance coordination of economic policies to promote productivity convergence . 
We already have a good mechanism for multilateral surveillance in place , but we should aim to focus it on the areas that really matter for economic union . 
This must go hand in hand with a discussion of how the EU can provide incentives to member states that are committed to difficult structural reforms at a time of retrenchment , which could lead to talks about possible forms of fiscal coordination . 
Though it is premature to enter into such discussions now , the issue should not be taken off the table . 
All of these changes concern the eurozone &apos;s members first , of course , but they are clearly relevant for the wider EU . 
At the same time , setting eurozone members apart from the wider EU would be inadvisable . 
Ensuring a stable and effective eurozone is essential to the smooth operation of the entire single market . 
And , without an efficient EU , the eurozone could not prosper . 
We have only one Europe , and we all need to work together to reform it and drive it forward . 
Indeed , with its 500 million consumers , the EU single market remains the largest destination for goods and services worldwide and is the best engine to restore growth . 
Key economic sectors , such as financial services , benefit greatly from the single market &apos;s common rules . 
Without the single market , all member states would be less attractive to foreign investors , who , once established in one member state , can move freely around the EU . 
The single market also provides a platform and leverage to export goods and services to international markets . 
So we must make the single market more open , internally and externally . 
But , to do so , we will need to make EU institutions more efficient , with better regulation and a lower administrative burden . 
Common institutions are needed to ensure that all EU countries &quot; interests are protected , and to act as a bridge between eurozone and non-eurozone member states . 
Frankly , the functioning of the EU and its institutions during the crisis has been a part of the problem . 
For many people , EU decision-making is opaque , inefficient , and removed from democratic control . 
Most worrying , the crisis has challenged the very idea of European integration . 
Thus , we will be able to advance a reformist agenda only if we have a convincing narrative that explains why we need Europe and why it serves the interests of current and future generations . 
I am a committed pro-European . 
I have in mind the extraordinary image of Helmut Kohl and Fran√ßois Mitterrand at Verdun in 1984 , two old leaders , standing hand in hand , remembering the victims of World War I. 
Next year will mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of that war . 
The experience of two world wars was foundational for European integration . 
But these memories no longer provide a sufficient catalyst for action . 
We need to find a forward-looking rationale that , after 50 years of integration , shows how acting together can help Europe achieve its goals in a changed global environment . 
There is nothing worse than letting people believe that European integration is something that proceeds by stealth , a journey driven by invisible and uncontrollable forces . 
The EU cannot last unless it is built on its citizens &quot; explicit commitment . 
Today , we have a chance to remodel Europe . 
Next year &apos;s European parliamentary elections will provide an opportunity for a fundamental debate about the EU &apos;s future . 
Unless we make a successful case for Europe ( and for a different Europe ) , Euro-skeptic forces will gain ground and Europe &apos;s decision-making processes will be blocked . 
The choice is clear , and it will have to be made sooner rather than later .
