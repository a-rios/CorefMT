A Tear for Argentina 
CAMBRIDGE - Argentina &apos;s latest default poses unsettling questions for policymakers . 
True , the country &apos;s periodic debt crises are often the result of self-destructive macroeconomic policies . 
The shift favors hardline creditors in bond issuances governed by US law . 
There are no heroes in this story , certainly not Argentina &apos;s policymakers , who a decade ago attempted unilaterally to force a massive generalized write-down on foreign bondholders . 
Economists who trumpeted the &quot; Buenos Aires consensus &quot; as the new way to run economies also look foolish in hindsight . 
The International Monetary Fund has long recognized that it made one too many loans to try to save Argentina &apos;s unsustainable dollar peg as it collapsed back in 2001 . 
This is not the first time that an Argentine default has upended international capital markets . 
According to the tabulation that Carmen Reinhart and I compiled in our 2009 book This Time is Different , Argentina has defaulted on seven previous occasions - in 1827 , 1890 , 1951 , 1956 , 1982 , 1989 , and 2001 . 
Argentina may be almost as famous for its defaults as it is for its soccer teams , but it is hardly alone . 
Virtually every emerging-market country has experienced recurrent sovereign-debt problems . 
Venezuela is the modern-day record holder , with 11 defaults since 1826 and possibly more to come . 
Back in 2003 , partly in response to the Argentine crisis , the IMF proposed a new framework for adjudicating sovereign debts . 
But the proposal faced sharp opposition not only from creditors who feared that the IMF would be too friendly to problem debtors , but also from emerging markets that foresaw no near-term risk to their perceived creditworthiness . 
The healthy borrowers worried that creditors would demand higher rates if the penalties for default softened . Recently , as an outgrowth of a reconsideration of the IMF &apos;s lending to the periphery of Europe ( and Greece in particular ) , the Fund has advanced another approach to debt rescheduling , one that might be easier to implement . 
The IMF now recognizes that the bulk of its financing was effectively being used to allow short-term creditors to exit loss-free . 
As a result , there was not enough money left over to help soften budget cuts necessitated by the sudden stop in foreign funding . 
The experience of the recent eurozone crisis stands in sharp contrast to the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s , when banks were not allowed to exit precipitously from their loans . 
If the new proposal is adopted , the IMF would conditionally refuse funds to countries carrying debt burdens that Fund staff determine are most likely unsustainable ; creditors would first have to agree to a &quot; reprofiling &quot; of debt . 
Reprofiling is a euphemism for debt restructuring , which allows countries to borrow from existing creditors for longer periods and at lower interest rates than they would be able to do on the open market . 
Although it is far from clear how easily the IMF could hold the line against hard-bargaining creditors , the new policy , if adopted , would toughen the Fund &apos;s approach to cases where it finds itself repeatedly throwing good money after bad . 
At present , the United States seems reluctant to go along with the IMF &apos;s proposal . 
Evidently , US authorities believe that in some situations geopolitics trump economics ( reflected , for example , in the IMF &apos;s recent re-entry into Ukraine after a string of failed programs ) . 
This American resistance is unfortunate . 
It would be far better if the US found ways simply to organize outright grants in exceptional cases like Ukraine , rather than design the international financial system around them . 
Given the recurring complications of adjudicating sovereign-debt contracts in foreign courts , and the world &apos;s inability to organize a credible and fair procedure for foreign bankruptcies , perhaps the best idea is to steer the bulk of international debt flows through debtor-country courts . 
Jeremy Bulow and I made a proposal along these lines 25 years ago ; it is still the right approach . 
In this scenario , countries interested in borrowing large amounts from abroad would need to develop institutions that made the promise to repay credible . 
By and large , experience supports this method . 
Indeed , the huge expansion in emerging-market domestic-debt issuance in recent years has helped reduce market tensions ( though continuing reliance by corporates on foreign debt still leaves many countries vulnerable ) . 
But domestic borrowing is not a panacea . 
To believe that any country issuing debt in its own currency is risk-free as long as the exchange rate is flexible is astonishingly naive . 
Nonetheless , Argentina &apos;s latest debt trauma shows that the global system for sovereign-debt workouts remains badly in need of repair . 
Deepening domestic debt markets - and perhaps change along the lines proposed by the IMF - is sorely needed .
