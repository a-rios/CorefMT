The Case of Myrna Mack : Laying out Guatemala \ u0027s Crimes 
International pressure encouraged Guatemala to become a democracy and also supported the 1996 Peace Accords that ended our decades long civil war . 
But if Guatemala is to truly enjoy the fruits of a new era , global efforts must persist in helping our country develop the legal , judicial and political courage to confront its past . 
That history includes the brutal 1990 murder of my sister , Myrna Elizabeth Mack Chang . 
At the time , Myrna &apos;s murder symbolized the savagery of a 36 year civil war in which government forces killed more than 200,000 Guatemalans . 
Now it is an icon of our democracy &apos;s unfulfilled promises . 
The 12 year judicial journey that we have made in pursuing her case underscores the intransigence , rather than the retreat , of the old order . 
Myrna , an anthropologist , studied the populations of Mayans and other indigenous Guatemalans forced to abandon their ancestral homes during the worst years of the country &apos;s civil war . 
She visited remote areas and listened to the villagers talk of watching &quot; their land laid to waste . &quot; 
She reported what she saw and heard . 
In doing so , she became an enemy of the state , because her work exposed the barbaric policies practiced against the displaced populations , uncovered the truth behind state actions , and called for the restoration of basic human rights . 
Myrna worked as an anthropologist , but the army failed to see her work as scholarly . 
Instead , intelligence officials viewed Myrna as an &quot; internal enemy . &quot; 
Shortly after she published her first study , government security forces began to investigate her . 
Then on September 11 th , 1990 as Myrna left her office , two men stabbed her 27 times . 
Vinicio Cerezo , head of state at the time Myrna was killed , later informed law enforcement authorities that Myrna was &quot; targeted &quot; because intelligence reports indicated that her work posed risks for the counterinsurgency effort . 
As the chief petitioner in her case , I have sought justice in Guatemala &apos;s courts for nearly 12 years . 
In 1993 , ex-Sergeant Major Noel de Jesús Beteta was sentenced to 25 years in prison , making him the first agent of the state and the first member of the army so punished . 
But , Beteta &apos;s conviction was only a partial victory . 
He was one of the men responsible for stabbing Myrna , but in Guatemala , human rights abuses begin at a much higher level . 
Responsibility for Myrna &apos;s death must be shared by the men in charge of government security in September 1990 . 
My task is to insure that General Edgar Godoy Gaitán and colonels Juan Valencia and Guillermo Oliva are held legally accountable for their roles in the chilling process that led to Myrna &apos;s assassination . 
I am not alone in this belief . 
The Supreme Court of Justice ordered an investigation of these military officials to determine their responsibility for planning the crime . 
A military court issued a warrant for their arrest . 
In 1999 , another judge ordered that they be tried . 
This was followed by the June 2001 court decision to set a date for trial , making it possible at last to present the evidence against these individuals . 
The courts &apos; actions represent Guatemala &apos;s first effort to bring high military officials to trial . 
Regrettably , the trial has been delayed indefinitely because the defendants &apos; lawyers appealed the case . 
Our successes in the matter of Myrna Mack are notable , but achieving them has proved difficult : the police investigator was assassinated ; judges have been threatened ; and witnesses have fled into exile . 
I have been harassed and campaigns to discredit me organized . 
Terror works . 
Evidence and procedural documents are lost or destroyed ; documents key to the legal process are altered ; and state security is invoked to deny information . 
Add to these the fact that many Guatemalan judges have functioned as agents of impunity rather than as servants of justice and a legal system that can be manipulated by the defense through a series of frivolous lawsuits . 
Still , we persist . 
We have taken the struggle from the technical , legal , and political arena closer to a hearing in the courts . 
Although the trial has been delayed , the exposure has given the Myrna Mack Foundation and other civic efforts the time to propose ways to modernize and democratize the justice system . 
But the roadblocks are many so international pressure on Guatemala must persist to lift these obstacles . 
Reform of the judiciary , conceived 16 years ago and strengthened through the peace accords , is sadly still being debated . 
In name , Guatemala is a fledgling democracy . 
In reality , power remains in the hands of the military high command and political and economic conservatives who have for years determined the nation &apos;s direction . 
We lack the climate for a truly democratic arena , where criminal behavior that the state previously supported is prosecuted . 
To insure such an environment , certain conditions are required : the political desire to dismantle state control , strong and independent agencies , adherence to international human rights conventions , and a commitment to justice . 
Our success in Myrna &apos;s case depends on guaranteeing that legal reforms move forward , strengthened by political clout and a genuine emphasis on justice and democracy . 
Our need is an international community that continues to push Guatemala toward a better , more just future .
