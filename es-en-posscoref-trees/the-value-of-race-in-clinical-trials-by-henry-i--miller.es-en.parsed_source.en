Race-Based Medicine ? 
PALO ALTO - Race can undoubtedly be a tricky subject , with any suggestion of genetic differences among racial groups - beyond superficial characteristics like skin color - potentially invoking memories of the nineteenth-century eugenics movement and its eventual role in Nazi ideology . 
Now , with drug companies increasingly seeking to develop medications that target particular racial groups , the long-taboo subject of racial genetics has reemerged . 
Much of the current debate centers on whether race should be a criterion for inclusion in clinical trials - and , by extension , whether drug labeling should mention race specifically . 
Although the issues are complicated , the solution is simple : follow the data . 
In fact , clinical trials are not intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of a treatment ( drug , medical device , or other intervention ) in a completely random sample from the general population . 
Rather , researchers &quot; enrich &quot; the study population by using a characteristic , such as age or laboratory-test results , to select a subset of patients in whom the intervention &apos;s effects will likely be easier to detect than they would be in an unfiltered population . 
In recent years , &quot; biomarkers , &quot; such as certain DNA sequences or the presence of a particular drug receptor , have become increasingly important indicators for determining eligibility for clinical trials . 
This approach is not new . 
For example , scientists have known for decades that certain drugs can cause severe and precipitous anemia in people with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme G6PD . 
More recently , researchers have learned that certain cancer drugs are ineffective in fighting tumors containing the mutated variant of the gene KRAS . 
Such discoveries have enhanced researchers &quot; ability to enrich study populations with patients who are likely to benefit from the drug , while sparing from any possible side effects of exposure those patients who are unlikely to benefit . 
Enrichment thus enables researchers to strengthen clinical trials &quot; &quot; statistical power , &quot; that is , the probability of detecting differences , if any exist , between study groups . 
Given that a larger number of subjects or iterations enhances an experiment &apos;s ability to detect all of the relevant effects , which bolsters confidence in the result , outcomes of small studies tend to imply significant uncertainty - unless the intervention &apos;s effects are potent . 
Enrichment allows researchers to perform smaller , more informative trials by helping them to design studies that will show a high &quot; relative treatment difference &quot; between the drug and whatever it is being compared to ( often a placebo , but sometimes another treatment ) . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , a biomarker contributed to the success of the small but seminal clinical trial of human growth hormone in children who were unable to produce it naturally . 
Some children lose the ability to make growth hormone due to injury or tumors ; others lack normal growth-hormone activity from birth , owing to a genetic mutation ; and others are missing the gene that codes for the hormone altogether . 
Giving the latter group exogenous growth hormone is futile , because their immune systems react to the &quot; foreign &quot; protein by producing antibodies . 
Although the hormone may stimulate growth for a short period , the antibodies soon bind and neutralize it . 
By limiting the study population to children in the other two groups , for whom exogenous growth hormone stimulates normal growth , researchers achieved a 100 % relative treatment difference . 
In other words , every subject who received the active drug responded , and none of those who received the placebo did . 
Given this result , US regulators approved the treatment for marketing based on a trial of only 28 patients . 
Clearly , genetic markers are useful in designing clinical trials . 
For the cardiac drug BiDil ( a combination of the vasodilators hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate ) , the answer is yes . 
In 1996 , inconclusive clinical trials led US regulators to reject the drug . 
But when more detailed analysis of the data revealed potentially elevated benefits for black patients , a new trial was performed on 1,050 self-identified &quot; black &quot; patients with severe heart failure for whom available treatments had proved ineffective . 
The results - a 43 % reduction in mortality and a 39 % decrease in hospital visits among patients who received BiDil - were so striking that the study was concluded early . 
Although BiDil has not been a great commercial success since its approval in 2009 , it remains on the market . 
Some regard race-based medical treatment as necessary to reduce health disparities , while others view it as downright discriminatory . 
When BiDil was approved , Francis Collins , who was Director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute at the time , warned that &quot; we should move without delay from blurry and potentially misleading surrogates for drug response , such as race , to the more specific causes . &quot; 
Of course , Collins was correct ; race is a crude and incomplete mechanism for understanding genetic differences . 
But we must fight illness with the data we have , not the data we wish we had . 
Political and ethical sensitivities notwithstanding , drug testing , approval , and labeling must go wherever the evidence leads .
