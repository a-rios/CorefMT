A New Birth for Social Democracy 
ISTANBUL - Nowadays , with the global economy undergoing fundamental transformation , workers worldwide are coming under significant pressure . 
Particularly in developed economies , social policies must adjust to provide the support that lower-income groups need , while encouraging growth and advancing wellbeing . 
The pressure has been unrelenting and inescapable . 
In the United States , real ( inflation-adjusted ) compensation for men with only a high school diploma fell by 21 % from 1979 to 2013 . 
In much of Europe , which provides stronger wage protection , unemployment has soared , especially since the euro crisis began in 2008 . 
Germany and some Northern European countries remain an exception , although the German labor market contains a large low-wage , mini-jobs segment . 
Driving these trends is the changing nature of work . 
For starters , services have been gaining ground worldwide , especially in developed economies . 
From 1970 to 2012 , the GDP share of services in the OECD countries increased from 53 % to 71 % . 
New technology and &quot; intelligent &quot; machines are not only displacing many types of workers in both the manufacturing and services sectors ; they are also facilitating the rise of new business models , in which individuals perform ( mostly low-paid service ) jobs within loose networks , instead of as dedicated employees of structured organizations . 
For example , the ride-sharing service Uber now has 162,000 active drivers in the US alone and is displacing traditional taxi services . 
The startup Handy hopes that its app achieves similar success in connecting customers to independent contractors providing various household services . 
As technology races ahead and value chains become globalized , workers must adapt , whether by changing jobs , relocating , or acquiring new skills - a challenge that is particularly burdensome for older workers , but demands a new approach to life planning for all . 
Some people - especially those who acquired valued and flexible skills early in life , as well as those who are already in strong positions because of inherited wealth - can flourish in this new economy . 
Millions of others , however , are ill-prepared for the new age . 
Center-left parties face a particularly difficult challenge , as their lower-income electoral base is lured away by anti-immigration , chauvinist competitors . 
Making matters worse , the fragmentation of production ( whether in goods or services ) , together with intensifying fiscal pressures , militates against these parties &quot; traditional reliance on collective bargaining to create systems and policies that insure citizens against shocks and misfortune . 
The right-wing response to this challenge - essentially to dismantle the welfare state - would leave the majority of citizens exposed to economic shocks and structural shifts ( merely reinforcing their sense of isolation and vulnerability ) . 
The progressive response , by contrast , must entail strong social policies - including both insurance and protection - compatible with new technologies and types of work . 
Concretely , this means that , instead of generalized social protection , each citizen would have a lifelong individual budget of support and security , while requiring that eligible recipients show initiative in determining how to adapt . 
The main difference between the progressive vision of a society underpinned by these &quot; citizen accounts &quot; and the conservative idea that individual citizens should create personal retirement accounts , take out student loans , or cover their own health insurance is the public sector &apos;s role . 
Not only would the public sector take primary responsibility for financing social protection ; public policy would also frame cooperation among government , employers , and recipients to eliminate duplication and bolster effectiveness and fairness . 
For example , a lifelong &quot; family account &quot; would enable paid maternity and paternity leave , provide child-care support , and allow time away from work to care for the sick or elderly . 
It would combine some general rules with income-adjusted financial contributions by the state , employers , and individuals . 
A &quot; learning account &quot; would set the parameters for educational support , including lifelong opportunities to acquire new skills and to teach skills to others . 
Basic forms of such a scheme already exist in many countries . 
Norway offers 49 weeks of parental leave with full pay , or 58 weeks with 80 % pay . 
Both parents must use at least 10 % of this budget , but they can also roll part of it over to use when their children start school ( and again benefit greatly from parental support ) . 
Of course , few countries are as wealthy as Norway ; but the principle - including support for elder care - can be applied to 30- , 40- , or 50-week periods . 
France , too , is now moving in this direction , creating &quot; individual activity accounts &quot; that aim to streamline its social policies , without sacrificing its sense of national solidarity . 
To be sure , this approach will not magically resolve all of the challenges countries currently face . 
Fiscal constraints will remain , as governments continue to fund public goods . 
Adequate taxation of high-income individuals and high-profit companies , together with strong and sustained efforts to reduce tax avoidance , will become even more vital to defend the revenue base . 
And unions will still be needed to defend their members &quot; interests . 
Nonetheless , a new social contract is needed to account for the increasingly important role that individual preferences , and individual responsibility , play in today &apos;s world . 
Each citizen should feel empowered , not isolated and abandoned , in the face of globalization and technological transformation . 
With this approach , social democracy can again drive progress , instead of being stifled by identity politics and market fundamentalism .
