China &apos;s High-Income Hopes 
SHANGHAI - It is widely agreed that economic development means more than GDP growth . 
As China is now learning , one does not guarantee the other . 
Unless China &apos;s leaders upgrade the country &apos;s growth strategy to stimulate technological progress and structural transformation , high-income status will continue to elude the world &apos;s second-largest economy and most populous country . 
To be sure , China &apos;s growth strategy - powered by investment in infrastructure , a massive increase in low-cost manufacturing exports , and technology transfers - has led to some structural change . 
As labor and capital moved from low-productivity sectors and regions to high-productivity activities , resource allocation became more efficient , real wages rose , and the economic structure was upgraded . 
But the growth strategies that lift a poor country to middle-income levels cannot be counted upon to propel it to high-income status . 
Indeed , there is no shortage of countries whose leaders have failed to recognize their strategies &quot; constraints and provide enough incentives to encourage the emergence of a new one , causing their economies to stagnate and leaving them stuck in the so-called &quot; middle-income trap . &quot; 
Perhaps the most notable exceptions to this rule have been in East Asia , where four economies - South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong , and Singapore - responded to external crises and challenges by shifting their growth strategies . 
For China , whose growth model has so far resembled that used by these economies before they attained middle-income status , a similar shift is urgently needed . 
As the late Yale economist Gustav Ranis observed nearly 20 years ago , the key to successful and sustainable development is &quot; avoiding the encrustation of ideas . &quot; 
For Chinese policymakers , this means recognizing the need to abandon some of the fundamental ideas that underpinned the economy &apos;s past growth , before they become so firmly encrusted that they jeopardize the country &apos;s development prospects . 
The first problem is China &apos;s enduring dependence on exports . 
In the early stages of economic development , almost all growth strategies boil down to trade strategies . 
But China &apos;s export-led growth model has limits - and the country is reaching them . 
Unless change comes soon , the foreign-exchange regime and capital controls on which the model relies will become too deeply entrenched , and the window of opportunity for adjustment will be missed . 
Another risk is that China &apos;s leaders continue to delay efforts to expand the services sector - including finance , insurance , wholesale and retail trade , and logistics - in the hope that the economy can continue to depend on manufacturing . 
Given how difficult it can be to gain support for such efforts , especially compared to policies aimed at boosting manufacturing , liberalization and expansion of the services sector will require a strong commitment from China &apos;s government . 
Here , Japan &apos;s failure in opening up its services sector - which impeded its ability to adapt its economic structure to its declining demographic dividend - can provide much-needed motivation . 
The final idea at risk of blocking further progress is that political transformation would undermine social order . 
One of the East Asian economies &quot; major lessons for developing countries is that economic development leads to institutional transformation , not the other way around . 
In Taiwan and South Korea , for example , authoritarian governments after World War II compensated for the weakness of the rule of law by creating transitional institutional arrangements to facilitate GDP growth . 
In this sense , China has a significant advantage . 
Countries with weak government capacity have rarely managed to achieve high-income status . 
But , as the description of these arrangements as &quot; transitional &quot; suggests , they cannot last indefinitely . 
After 35 years of dependence on such arrangements , China must embrace the rule of law and establish a reliable , independent judicial system capable of facilitating the liberalization of the services sector , protecting intellectual-property rights , and underpinning a competitive market-based system . 
In short , the biggest risk to China &apos;s continued development is not a crisis , but the failure of its political leaders and intellectual elites to recognize the need to transform a growth strategy that has proved successful so far . 
In fact , to the extent that a crisis could do more good than harm , warnings that the rapid credit expansion of recent years could trigger a debt crisis , or that the real-estate sector is on the verge of collapse , may not be as worrying as many believe . 
Ideally , no such crisis would be needed . 
In this scenario , China &apos;s economic slowdown since 2008 , which could be viewed as China &apos;s first modern growth crisis , would be sufficient to force China &apos;s leaders to shift their focus from supporting double-digit annual GDP increases to restructuring the economy . 
In fact , a consensus already appears to be emerging concerning the need to reduce China &apos;s dependence on exports , expand trade in services , attract more foreign investment to its services sector , and accelerate the liberalization of exchange rates , interest rates , and cross-border capital flows - exemplified in the establishment of the Shanghai Pilot Free-Trade Zone last year . 
And , following the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s 18th Central Committee last November , China &apos;s leaders declared their commitment to allowing the market to play a greater role in shaping economic outcomes . 
These are undoubtedly steps in the right direction . 
The question is whether China &apos;s leaders will follow through on their declarations before it is too late .
