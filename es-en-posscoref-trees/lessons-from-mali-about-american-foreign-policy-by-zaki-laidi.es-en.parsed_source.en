Following from Above 
PARIS - France &apos;s military intervention in Mali is proceeding apace , with the recent fall of Timbuktu representing a significant milestone in the effort to rout the Islamist rebels who took control of the north of the country . 
More broadly , the intervention &apos;s apparent success underscores three key points . 
First , it confirms that France retains the ability to act as Europe &apos;s prime mover . 
France has a large and rapidly deployable military force , as it demonstrated in Libya in 2011 . 
Furthermore , this military capability is tied to a worldview , rather than just to the defense of economic interests . 
In Mali , France is not seeking to lay claim to resources , export democracy , or extend a Fran√ßafrique in which it no longer believes . 
More prosaically , France seeks to stabilize a country that is subject to violent forces that are not always led by Malians , and that are likely to disrupt the whole sub-region while threatening Europe . 
Second , the intervention once again highlights the strategic insignificance of the European Union , which is promoting a &quot; comprehensive strategy &quot; for Mali and the whole region in order to avoid the crucial question : Under what conditions will Europe use force ? 
The final point concerns the nature of American involvement in the conflict . 
The United States remains France &apos;s most valuable strategic ally in this endeavor , but the terms have changed . 
Indeed , after a decade of fruitless ( to say the least ) military interventions , tightening budget constraints have led President Barack Obama &apos;s administration to sacrifice some ground forces in order to keep intact its substantial air and naval capabilities , the purpose being , apparently , to contain China . 
Obama &apos;s recalibration has accentuated the realist turn in American foreign policy , according to which the US is now willing to intervene only when its immediate interests are at stake . 
In other cases , America &apos;s allies will have to demonstrate their commitment in order to receive conditional backing . 
This new approach was applied to Libya , where it was characterized as &quot; leading from behind . &quot; 
But this concept is inapt , because it implies that , ultimately , the US was the leader . 
Clearly , it was not . 
Absent the initial push from France and Great Britain , the US would most likely have remained passive , which was what the State and Defense Departments advised . 
( The State Department even went so far as to warn France and Great Britain not to vote for United Nations Resolution 1973 , which authorized intervention . ) 
Obama ultimately overturned his bureaucrats &quot; position , proposing a strong military intervention , without ground troops , for a very limited period . 
In the end , the US delivered 75 % of the intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( ISR ) , 75 % of air-to-air refueling , and 90 % of the targeting intelligence - an indisputably significant contribution . 
Yet Libya marked the beginning of a concept - applicable to Mali today - that might be termed &quot; following from above . &quot; 
In other words , the US is conveying to its allies that it will no longer intervene in low-priority areas unless its allies commit first , just like an investor waiting for the promoter to make a down payment . 
As in Libya , France had to take the initiative in Mali . 
And , as in Libya , American support was crucial in the four areas where France and other European countries fall short : aerial reconnaissance , targeting , air transportation , and air-to-air refueling . 
Unlike in Libya , though , in Mali the US took an unprecedented step in the history of transatlantic relations by considering making France pay to lease troop transport aircraft . 
Although this proposal ultimately was discarded , it reveals both the erosion of US support and America &apos;s determination to signal its non-assistance to Europeans who are in harm &apos;s way . 
Moreover , there are real disagreements within the US bureaucracy when it comes to assessing the threat that Al Qaeda in Mali poses for US interests . 
Following from above thus has operational and symbolic significance . 
Operationally , it is limited to ISR and does not involve ground troops . 
Symbolically , it means backing initial and significant efforts undertaken by others . 
For Europe , this situation is worrying on two counts . 
First , it illustrates the stop-and-go dynamic undergirding American politics , which can swing - within just five years - from a disturbing expansionism to an equally worrying withdrawal from the world . 
A jihadist Mali admittedly does not directly threaten the US , or at least less so than it does Europe . 
But does it make sense to stick to such a simple analysis after what occurred on September 11 , 2001 ? 
Second , Europe persists in ignoring the need to determine under what conditions it can and should use force , not for peacekeeping but to fight potentially hostile forces . 
The aversion to war is one of the most serious risks that Europe currently faces . 
For the French , the US position will force a reevaluation of the importance of Africa in France &apos;s global strategy , given that the government &apos;s 2008 white paper on defense clearly minimized the continent &apos;s importance , most likely to justify a reduction in French ground forces . 
Moreover , it will encourage France to broach the subject of military force with its European allies . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is known to criticize France for being less than enthusiastic about European political union . 
The question is how to build Europe with states that bury their heads in the sand at the mention of the use of force , while cynically admitting that France is defending all of Europe in Mali . 
France must now insist on addressing the question of the use of force as a pre-condition to any negotiations on Europe &apos;s political integration . 
By showing Europe that it is following its actions from above , the US will once again force Europeans to awaken from their political torpor and strategic mediocrity . 
The question remains whether Europeans will be willing to do so .
