The Second Coming of Barack Obama 
WASHINGTON , DC - The race was tough , but US President Barack Obama has won re-election . 
The question now , for the United States and the world , is what will he do with a fresh four-year term ? 
To win re-election with a still-weak economy and unemployment close to 8 % was not easy . 
Many leaders - Nicolas Sarkozy , Gordon Brown , and José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero come to mind - have been swept away by economic discontent in recent years . 
Although the financial disaster erupted on George W. Bush &apos;s watch , after eight years of a Republican presidency , Obama had to carry the burden of an anemic recovery . 
Obama won not only because of his extraordinary personal resilience , but also because a sufficient number of middle-class voters , while unhappy with the pace of economic progress , sensed that an Obama presidency would help them more than the policies championed by his Republican challenger , Mitt Romney , which were perceived as tilted to the affluent . 
Moreover , America &apos;s ongoing demographic transformation makes it harder for candidates who are unable to reach out strongly to Latinos and other minority communities - something that Romney singularly failed to do - to carry the country . 
Some aspects of the campaign , particularly the amount of money spent and its negative tone , struck many observers as objectionable . 
But the competitiveness of American democracy - the fact that an alternative always exists , and that those in power have to fight hard to stay there - was on admirable display for the whole world to see . 
Obama will embark on his second term with the global economy at a crossroads . 
In the US , the uneven and weak recovery has been sustained by extraordinarily expansive monetary policies and ongoing large fiscal deficits . 
While corporate coffers hold mountains of cash , private investment stagnates . 
In Japan , solid economic performance remains elusive , while prime ministers succeed each other at a breathtaking pace . 
Likewise , Europe is on life support , thanks to European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s astute maneuvering and promises of unlimited intervention in sovereign-debt markets . 
But unemployment is at its highest in decades and growth has essentially stalled , even in Germany , while the troubled southern economies are mired in deep recession . 
The situation in Greece , moreover , has become socially unsustainable ; 
Greece is small , but a total collapse there could have very negative financial and psychological effects elsewhere . 
The world &apos;s emerging-market economies are in better shape ; but , while their underlying trend growth in potential output is much higher than that of the advanced economies , there is no cyclical de-coupling . 
The world economy is an interdependent whole : trouble in any important part of it is transmitted globally . 
That is true beyond the purview of narrowly macroeconomic problems as well : for example , the need to address climate change can no longer be ignored . 
The US cannot determine the world economy &apos;s future on its own , but the course taken by America nonetheless has huge global importance , given that it remains the largest economy and retains considerable influence in venues such as the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , and the G-20 . 
American ideas continue to affect the policy debate worldwide . 
So , what should Obama &apos;s top economic-policy priorities be in his second term ? 
Despite the difficulties facing the global economy , there are huge investible resources in the US , China , Germany , and elsewhere . 
While there are climate and resource constraints , we are still at the beginning of a technological revolution that holds tremendous potential for higher productivity and greater prosperity , along with challenging implications for labor and employment . 
But sustainable economic growth requires that those with investible resources actually invest them . 
And that will not happen unless and until a broad-based recovery of the middle- and lower-income groups in advanced economies , including the US , delivers the prolonged rebound in demand for which investors are waiting . 
There are plenty of profits to be made - actual taxes on capital are not too high , and cheap finance is available to the corporate sector . 
But the concentration of income at the top - more than 90 % of the gains from US economic growth in 2011 , for example , went to the top 1 % - is constraining broad-based recovery and leaving macroeconomic policy caught between the need for continued &quot; stimulus &quot; and the dangers of growing public debt and asset bubbles inflated by record-low interest rates . 
In other words , a more balanced income distribution is not only a social or ethical issue ; it is crucial for macroeconomic and , indeed , long-term corporate success . 
This is vital for many countries , above all the US and China . 
Then there is the pressing need - in the US and globally - for education and appropriate skill formation . 
Without the skills required by new and incipient technologies , too many workers will simply be unemployable . 
A key benefit of prioritizing broad-based quality education is that it also helps to solve the income-distribution problem . 
Finally , there is the need for effective international cooperation . 
China &apos;s current-account surplus has declined , but now northern Europe runs a $ 500 billion surplus , while demand in southern Europe is collapsing and the US is running a deficit that is close to $ 500 billion . 
The longer-term challenge of climate change and extreme weather patterns also requires global cooperation and a post-election shift toward much stronger US engagement , which could unleash a multifaceted clean-energy revolution , fueling large job-creating investments and a new cycle of growth . 
After America &apos;s long , hard-fought election campaign , it is time for comprehensive policy reforms . 
One hopes that the US Congress will recognize this as well , leading to support for measures that could help hundreds of millions of people in the US and around the world .
