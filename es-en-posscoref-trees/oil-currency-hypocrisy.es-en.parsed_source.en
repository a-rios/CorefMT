Oil Currency Hypocrisy 
CAMBRIDGE - Does it make sense for United States Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to be touring the Middle East supporting the region &apos;s hard dollar exchange-rate pegs , while the Bush administration simultaneously blasts Asian countries for not letting their currencies appreciate faster against the dollar ? 
Unfortunately , this blatant inconsistency stems from the US &apos;s continuing economic and financial vulnerability rather than reflecting any compelling economic logic . 
Instead of promoting dollar pegs , as Paulson is , the US should be supporting the International Monetary Fund &apos;s behind-the-scenes efforts to promote de-linking of oil currencies and the dollar . 
Perhaps the Bush administration worries that if oil countries abandoned the dollar standard , today &apos;s dollar weakness would turn into a rout . 
But the US should be far more worried about promoting faster adjustment of its still-gaping trade deficit , which in many ways lies at the root of the recent sub-prime mortgage crisis . 
The administration &apos;s multi-pronged effort to postpone pain to US consumers , including super easy monetary and fiscal policy , only risks a greater crisis in the not-too-distant future . 
It is not at all hard to imagine the whole strategy boomeranging in early 2009 , soon after the next US president takes office . 
Of course , a strengthening of the oil currencies ( including not only the Gulf States , but also other Middle East countries and Russia ) would not turn around the US trade balance overnight . 
But oil countries do account for a large share of the world &apos;s trade surpluses , and a weaker dollar would help promote US exports to some degree , even in the short run . 
More importantly , it is imperative for US policies to be consistent across regions . 
How can the US Treasury , on the one hand , periodically flirt with labeling China a &quot; currency manipulator &quot; and , on the other hand , condone a similar strategy in oil-exporting countries ? 
Of course , one can imagine other reasons for US supplication to the oil states . 
Perhaps the administration worries that it cannot simultaneously beg for lower dollar oil prices and help promote a weaker dollar . 
But , contrary to popular opinion , the two actually have little to do with each other . 
Oil prices are set in a world market , and depend mainly on the quantities demanded and supplied by different regions , not the currency of payment . 
It is not at all clear that the dollar price of oil would evolve any differently if the euro , rather than the dollar , were the reference currency . 
Secretary Paulson has emphasized that the US is &quot; open for business &quot; from sovereign wealth funds . 
One can hope that his confidence is justified . 
There is no cause for the US to place any significant new restrictions on sovereign investments in the US beyond those that it already has on trade . 
Besides , the US needs these investments to help re-capitalize its badly weakened financial system . 
However , even if we can agree on keeping the US open to sovereign wealth fund investments , that is no reason for promoting exchange-rate policies that exacerbate the very trade imbalances that are driving the whole sovereign wealth fund phenomenon in the first place . 
Then again , perhaps the Bush administration is worried that if the oil currencies strengthen too much against the dollar , it will start becoming too expensive for the US to scale up its military operations in the Middle East . 
This , too , is wrong-headed . 
If a cheaper dollar leads to an invasion of US exports to the Middle East and rising living standards in the region , all parties will be far better served . 
What about the interests of the oil countries themselves ? 
Are they right to fear potentially catastrophic results from abandoning the dollar ? 
As with China , these concerns are overblown . 
Even with the prevalence of dollar indexation across the region , exchange-rate appreciation would still help promote cheaper imports and higher living standards . 
Moreover , as public confidence in the de-linked oil currencies increases over time , dollar indexation of private contracts will diminish , and currency movements will have a greater impact on overall prices . 
More immediately , inflation across the oil states is soaring today , with CPI inflation in the Middle East averaging more than 6 % after years of relative stability . 
If this inflation is allowed to continue and deepen , it is likely to have effects easily as pernicious as the exchange-rate appreciation the region &apos;s leaders are striving so hard to avoid . 
Perhaps the most important positive effect of exchange-rate appreciation would be to help promote the development of domestically-oriented industries such as health care , education , and banking , thereby alleviating some of the region &apos;s mass underemployment . 
To be sure , there are important differences between the oil exporters and the Asian economies . 
With world energy prices at record highs , it makes sense for oil economies to run surpluses , thereby saving for when oil supplies eventually peter out . 
But flexible exchange rates are still the right way for the region to develop a more balanced economic and financial base . 
As for the US , it makes little sense to support dollar currency pegs in any large emerging market , at least until its trade balance normalizes . This is no time for oil currency hypocrisy .
