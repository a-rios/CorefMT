A Glimmer of Hope in Iran 
BERLIN - No one could have reckoned with Hassan Rowhani &apos;s victory in Iran &apos;s presidential election . 
Even Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was probably more than a little surprised by Rowhani &apos;s first-round victory , following a campaign that began with eight candidates . 
As a result , the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program , as well as the civil war in Syria , may well take on a new dynamic . 
But that is how it is in the Middle East : you never know what lies around the corner . 
This year marks the tenth anniversary of the launch , at the foreign-minister level , of negotiations between Iran and the European triumvirate of Germany , France , and the United Kingdom on Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
I was there , representing Germany ; so was Rowhani , who led the Iranian delegation . 
The talks have continued until today - in an expanded format that includes Germany and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council ( the P5 + 1 ) - without any tangible results . 
Now Rowhani returns to the risky business of Iran &apos;s nuclear program , though this time as President . 
What can we - and he - expect ? 
Based on my personal experience , Rowhani is a polite and open character . 
Unlike outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , he surrounds himself with very skillful and experienced diplomats . 
But there should be no doubt that he is a man of the regime - a realist and moderate member of the Islamic Republic &apos;s political elite - not a representative of the opposition . 
And , of course , he backs Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
If Rowhani wants to succeed in office , he will have to keep his promise to improve Iranians &quot; living conditions without endangering the Islamic Republic in the process . 
That will not be easy ; in fact , it could amount to trying to square a circle . 
The economic improvement that voters demanded in electing Rowhani can almost certainly be achieved only if Western and international sanctions are lifted . 
But an end to international sanctions presupposes a breakthrough in the nuclear negotiations . 
It may also presuppose at least a temporary settlement of the main regional conflicts . 
The Middle East has changed dramatically in the last ten years . 
America has reduced its involvement , having withdrawn its troops from Iraq and winding down its engagement in Afghanistan by next year . 
At the same time , we are witnessing the dissolution of the old Middle East created by France and Britain after World War I , when Europe &apos;s two great colonial powers created territorial mandates in Palestine , Syria ( including present-day Lebanon ) , Transjordan , and Iraq . 
A new regional order is not yet discernible , which points to a future fraught with risk and possible chaos . 
As Iran seeks to assert its influence and interests , as well as those of its Shia allies , its dispute with the Security Council over its nuclear program has become closely tied to its regional ambitions . 
After all , the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran would most likely exacerbate violent conflict and a nuclear arms race in the region . 
As a result , both issues may well have to be addressed successfully prior to any move to lift the sanctions . 
Iran and its international interlocutors should learn from the past and manage expectations accordingly . 
There will not be any quick solutions ( if , indeed , there are any solutions at all ) , given the parties &quot; diametrically opposed interests , their respective domestic and alliance-related obstacles , and a profound lack of trust on all sides . 
Moreover , aside from negotiating with the P5 + 1 , Iran would be well advised to launch direct negotiations with the United States . 
It will also most likely have to improve its relations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states , and change its behavior toward Israel , if a positive result is to be achieved . 
Similarly , the West will have to understand that the Islamic Republic is not a monolithic dictatorship . 
The regime has multiple coexisting power centers , which influence and limit each other &apos;s decisions . 
The office of the president is just one power center . 
Iran has tried two political approaches in the last ten years : a reformist model , under President Mohamed Khatami , and hardline radicalism , under Ahmadinejad . 
Both approaches failed . 
The reformers could not overcome conservative opposition , while the radicals could not defeat the domestic economic realities wrought by their foreign and nuclear policies . 
Rowhani must seek a path that does not cost him the support of the majority of the regime &apos;s power centers , yet that also allows him to fulfill the mandate he received from voters . 
At home , too , massive distrust will further complicate an inherently difficult task . 
In America and the West , many will probably regard Rowhani as the friendly face of the Islamic Republic , whereas Ahmadinejad was its true - because more radical - embodiment . 
Many Iranians , in turn , regard Obama as the friendly face of a US that still seeks regime change in their country , whereas his predecessor , George W. Bush , was America &apos;s more honest - because more radical - representative . 
Both perceptions distort reality , though both contain a kernel of truth . 
Despite these perceptions - or perhaps precisely because of them - Rowhani &apos;s presidency offers an unexpected opportunity for both the nuclear negotiations and a political solution in Syria . 
Iran &apos;s participation in an international peace conference is an absolute necessity , if only to test Rowhani &apos;s seriousness . 
During the Afghanistan conference in Bonn in 2001 , Iran behaved in a pragmatic , results-oriented way - an approach that went completely unrewarded by the US . 
As for the nuclear negotiations , the P5 + 1 will focus on objective guarantees that leave Iran no path toward military use of its nuclear capabilities . 
For Iran , the focal point of its efforts will be recognition of its right to civilian use of nuclear energy , in keeping with the provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and its protocols . 
Both issues sound simpler than they are : the devil is in the details , and the details leave ample scope for disagreement over the definition , monitoring , and enforcement of terms . 
Again , maintaining realistic expectations must be paramount . 
A successful outcome in the nuclear negotiations and resolution or even containment of the main regional conflicts will be difficult to achieve . 
But it would be the height of irresponsibility not to seize the unexpected opportunity created by Rowhani &apos;s election with all the strength , good faith , and creativity we can muster .
