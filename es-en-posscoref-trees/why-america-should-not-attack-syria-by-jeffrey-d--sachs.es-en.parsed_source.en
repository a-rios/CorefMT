Calling Off America &apos;s Bombs 
NEW YORK - As the US Congress considers whether to authorize American military intervention in Syria , its members should bear in mind a basic truth : While Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad has repeatedly used extreme violence to retain power , the United States - and other governments in the Middle East and Europe - share responsibility for turning Syria into a killing field . 
These governments , led by the US , have explicitly sought the violent overthrow of Assad . 
Without their involvement , Assad &apos;s regime would most likely have remained repressive ; with their involvement , Syria has become a site of mass death and destruction . 
More than 100,000 people have died , and many of the world &apos;s cultural and archaeological treasures have been demolished . 
Syria &apos;s civil war has occurred in two phases . 
The first phase , roughly from January 2011 until March 2012 , was largely an internal affair . 
When the Arab Spring erupted in Tunisia and Egypt in January 2011 , protests erupted in Syria as well . 
In addition to the usual grievances under a brutal regime , Syrians were reeling from a massive drought and soaring food prices . 
The protests became a military rebellion when parts of the Syrian army broke with the regime and established the Free Syrian Army . 
Neighboring Turkey was probably the first outside country to support the rebellion on the ground , giving sanctuary to rebel forces along its border with Syria . 
Although the violence was escalating , the death toll was still in the thousands , not tens of thousands . 
The second phase began when the US helped to organize a large group of countries to back the rebellion . 
At a meeting of foreign ministers in Istanbul on April 1 , 2012 , the US and other countries pledged active financial and logistical support for the Free Syrian Army . 
Most important , then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared : &quot; We think Assad must go . &quot; 
That open-ended statement , without any clear means to achieve the goal that it announced , has done much to fuel military escalation and the rising death toll in Syria , while pushing the US repeatedly to defend its &quot; credibility &quot; against a line in the sand that it should not have drawn . 
Then and now , the US has claimed to speak in the interest of the Syrian people . 
This is very doubtful . 
The US views Syria mainly through the lens of Iran , seeking to depose Assad in order to deprive Iran &apos;s leaders of an important ally in the region , one that borders Israel . 
The US-led effort in Syria is thus best understood as a proxy war with Iran - a cynical strategy that has contributed to the massive rise in violence . 
The US government &apos;s misguided move from potential mediator and problem solver to active backer of the Syrian insurrection was , predictably , a terrible mistake . 
It put the US in effective opposition to the United Nations peace initiative then being led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan , whose approach was to call for a ceasefire followed by a negotiated political transition . 
The US preempted this process by backing the military rebellion and insisting on Assad &apos;s immediate departure . 
It is hard to understand this blunder . 
Even if the US ultimately sought to force Assad from office , its blunt action hardened Assad &apos;s resistance , as well as that of his two allies in the UN Security Council , Russia and China . 
Aside from seeking to defend their own interests in the region , both countries understandably rejected the idea of US-led regime change in Syria . Russia argued that America &apos;s insistence on Assad &apos;s immediate departure was an impediment to peace . In this , Russia was right . 
Indeed , Russia was playing a plausibly constructive role at the time , albeit one premised on Assad remaining in power for at least a transitional period , if not indefinitely . 
Russia sought a pragmatic approach that would protect its commercial interests in Syria and its naval base at the port of Tartus , while bringing an end to the bloodletting . 
The Russians openly backed Annan &apos;s peace initiative . 
Yet , with the US and others financing the rebels , Russia ( and Iran ) supplied more - and more sophisticated - weapons to the regime . 
Now , with the use of chemical weapons , probably by the Syrian government ( and possibly by both sides ) , the US has again ratcheted up the stakes . 
Bypassing the UN once again , the US is declaring its intention to intervene directly by bombing Syria , ostensibly to deter the future use of chemical weapons . 
America &apos;s motivations are not entirely clear . 
Perhaps there is no underlying foreign-policy logic , but only carelessness . 
If there is a kind of logic , however weak , it seems to revolve around Iran and Israel , rather than Syria per se . 
There are many dictatorships in the world that the US does not try to overthrow . 
On the contrary , many of them are ostensibly America &apos;s close allies . 
So why does the US continue to back a deadly rebellion in a civil war that is continuing to escalate dangerously , now to the point of chemical-weapons attacks ? 
To put it simply , President Barack Obama &apos;s administration has inherited the neoconservative philosophy of regime change in the Middle East . 
The overriding idea is that the US and its close allies get to choose who governs in the region . 
Assad must go not because he is authoritarian , but because he is allied with Iran , which , from the perspective of the US , Israel , Turkey , and several Gulf countries , makes him a regional threat . 
In fact , the US has probably been lured into serving these countries &quot; own narrower interests , whether it be Israel &apos;s unconvincing vision of its own security or the Sunni countries &quot; opposition to Shia Iran . 
But , in the long term , US foreign policy divorced from international law cannot produce anything other than more war . 
The US should reverse course . 
A direct US attack on Syria without UN backing is far more likely to inflame the region than it is to resolve the crisis there - a point well appreciated in the United Kingdom , where Parliament bucked the government by rejecting British participation in a military strike . 
Instead , the US should provide evidence of the chemical attacks to the UN ; call on the Security Council to condemn the perpetrators ; and refer such violations to the International Criminal Court . 
Moreover , the Obama administration should try to work with Russia and China to enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention . 
If the US fails in this , while acting diplomatically and transparently ( without a unilateral attack ) , Russia and China would find themselves globally isolated on this important issue . 
More broadly , the US should stop using countries like Syria as proxies against Iran . 
Withdrawal of US financial and logistical support for the rebellion , and calling on others to do the same , would not address Syria &apos;s authoritarianism or resolve America &apos;s issues with Iran , but it would stop or greatly reduce the large-scale killing and destruction in Syria itself . 
It would also enable the UN peace process to resume , this time with the US and Russia working together to restrain violence , keep Al Qaeda at bay ( a shared interest ) , and find a longer-term pragmatic solution to Syria &apos;s deep domestic divisions . 
And the search for a US modus vivendi with Iran - where a new president suggests a change of course on foreign policy - could be revived . 
It is time for the US to help stop the killing in Syria .
