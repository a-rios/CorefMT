The Problem is Authoritarianism , Not Islam 
PRINCETON - Is Islam fundamentally incompatible with democracy ? 
Time and again events compel us to ask this question . 
And yet it is a question that obscures more than it illuminates . 
Turkey , Egypt , and Tunisia are very different countries , but one thing that they share are Islamist governments ( at least until recently in Egypt &apos;s case ) . 
To varying degrees , these governments have undermined their democratic credentials by failing to protect civil and human rights and employing heavy-handed tactics against their opponents . 
Despite repeated assurances , Islamist leaders have shown little interest in democracy beyond winning at the ballot box . 
So those who believe that the removal of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi &apos;s government was justified have a point . 
As the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s rule became increasingly authoritarian , it trampled on the ideals and aspirations of the Tahrir Square revolution that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 . 
Nonetheless , the support that the military coup received from many Egyptian liberals is difficult to fathom . 
Clever word games cannot hide the essence of what happened : a government that came to power in a fair election was overthrown by the army . 
Some believe that military interventions can serve as a useful course correction . 
US Secretary of State John Kerry said that the Egyptian army was &quot; restoring democracy . &quot; 
And the former US ambassador James Jeffrey drew on Turkey &apos;s experience , and the 1980 coup in particular , to argue that the military could help in &quot; moderating Islamist movements . &quot; 
The notion that a politically transcendent impartial arbiter can step in to prevent abuse of power and reinvigorate democracy is an attractive one . 
But it is belied by Turkey &apos;s own history . 
True , the Turkish military was not interested in governing directly , and handed power back to civilian governments after its coups . 
Even so , its repeated interventions greatly harmed the development of a democratic political culture . 
Ultimately , democracy relies on an implicit quid pro quo among contending groups , according to which each agrees to protect the others &quot; rights in exchange for recognition of its entitlement to govern should it win an election . 
Constitutional provisions alone cannot ensure such an outcome , for those in power can easily override them . 
Instead , norms of proper political behavior must become embodied in the polity &apos;s enduring institutions - its political parties , parliaments , and courts - in order to prevent abuse of power . 
What sustains these norms is the knowledge that undermining them will have consequences that are damaging to all . 
If I do not protect your rights while in power today , you will have little reason to respect mine when you come to power tomorrow . 
When an outside force such as the military interrupts this game , either directly or because one of the parties can rely on its intervention , the dynamics of political behavior change irrevocably . 
The loss of continuity in political parties , parliamentary procedures , and judicial processes encourages short-term calculation and spawns illiberal practices . 
This is exactly the malady of young democracies . 
It is also the problem that plagues Turkish democracy , despite its longer track record . 
When Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) came to power in 2002 , it not only lacked a democratic culture , but also had much to fear about how the secularist-military old guard might react . 
So it behaved exactly according to its fear , launching a series of show trials targeting senior military officials and other perceived opponents . 
When Erdoğan &apos;s government eventually lost the support of liberals who had initially supported it , it cracked down on the media and freedom of expression . 
Given this backdrop of repression and punctuated democracy , the failure of Islamists in Egypt and Turkey tells us less about Islam &apos;s compatibility with democracy than we might think . 
Did Morsi and Erdoğan behave as they did because of their religious ideologies , or would most political leaders seeking to retain power have acted in similar ways in their position ? 
Latin America , where Islam plays no political role , has no shortage of populist strongmen who routinely violate civil liberties and political rights . 
None of this is to condone the abuse of power by Islamist leaders . 
But , just as the Turkish military &apos;s repeated interventions against a perceived Islamist threat have impeded democracy , so the Egyptian military &apos;s toppling of Morsi will not help to restore it . 
An entity that is authoritarian and hierarchical in nature cannot be relied on to protect and promote a democratic transition . 
A case can be made for military intervention when a country finds itself on the edge of civil war , as Turkey was in 1980 ( and as Egypt arguably was in July ) ; but one should not confuse restoring order with restoring democracy . 
While the battle for democracy must be won or lost at home , outsiders do have a role to play . 
International actors such as human-rights organizations can usefully document and publicize rights violations and other abuses of power . 
Democratic countries - particularly the United States and members of the European Union - can denounce authoritarian practices with a clear voice and resist the temptation of cozying up to regional bullies for short-term strategic advantage . 
Given economic globalization and global communications , autocratic rulers derive almost as much strength from their international standing as they do from their control of domestic institutions . 
What does not help - and in fact backfires - is for outsiders to view the political crisis of Middle Eastern societies as the result of an Islamist-secularist divide . 
This perspective plays directly into the hands of authoritarian rulers like Erdoğan , who can leverage the perceived Islamophobia of foreign powers to mobilize their political base . 
Human-rights abuses and violations of the rule of law should be denounced for what they are - without linking them to culture or religion .
