Not So Splendid Isolation 
PARIS - At the end of the nineteenth century , the British Empire pursued a policy of what it called &quot; splendid isolation , &quot; reflecting its leaders &quot; determination to stand aloof from international engagements . 
With the strength of its economy and the superiority of its navy , the United Kingdom could afford to avoid entanglement in others &quot; affairs . 
Today , as recent events have shown , isolation is - more often than not - a mistake , an unenviable condition resulting from failed policies . 
Cuba &apos;s emergence from decades of forced isolation is a victory for the island , while North Korea &apos;s pariah status has led it to the brink of collapse . 
Similarly , Israel &apos;s controversial policies and diplomacy risk leaving the Jewish state unprecedentedly alone . 
And inward-looking policies in Russia and Turkey , driven largely by their leaders &quot; egos , are unlikely to produce anything but harm . 
By beginning to normalize relations , Cuba and the United States have snatched victory from the jaws of a double defeat : the failure of the embargo and the failure of the Cuban economy . 
The deal struck in December allows Cuban President Raúl Castro to claim success in mending ties without making significant political concessions . 
For US President Barack Obama , the breakthrough is a chance to cement his legacy as a transformative president , like his models Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt - even if , in ending nearly six decades of failed policy , he more closely resembles Richard Nixon , who presided over the opening to China . 
Though Pope Francis , the first Latin American pontiff , was instrumental in facilitating the resumption of diplomatic ties , so was the plunging price of oil . 
Continued isolation would have left the Cuban regime dangerously exposed , given the declining financial fortunes of its primary sponsor , petroleum-rich Venezuela . 
North Korea stands in stark contrast to Cuba &apos;s successful policy of engagement . 
With its alleged involvement in the recent cyber attack on Sony Pictures , the regime has backed itself further into its tiny corner . 
The result can only be deeper - and ultimately more painful - isolation . 
Even China , North Korea &apos;s main patron , is losing patience with its client state . 
In an interdependent world , isolation is no longer a source of pride ; on the contrary , it is a cause for concern . 
Nowhere is that more evident than Israel . 
Not even the country &apos;s technological wonders or its vibrant civil society can make up for its unappealing politics and policies . 
The result has been a dangerously rapid diminution of much-needed Western support . 
Equally worrisome is the recent drift of former imperial powers Russia and Turkey . 
Both countries &quot; leaders , Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , place their own power above their citizens &quot; interests , and both are fanning the flames of misguided nationalism and religious chauvinism , surrounded by frightened courtiers whose main function has been to keep reality at bay . 
Turkey is more dynamic and energetic than Russia , and its economy certainly is faring much better , but both regimes are overestimating the strength of their position and underestimating the cost of their autocratic turn . 
Just four years ago , Turkey was seen as a model to follow , particularly for the Muslim world . 
Today , the country is on the defensive , fearful even of its own journalists . 
During the early stages of the Islamic State &apos;s siege of the Kurdish town of Kobani , just across the border in Syria , Turkey seemed to be replicating the Soviet Union &apos;s tactic during the 1944 Warsaw uprising , when Nazi German troops fought Polish resistance fighters : Let the belligerents exhaust each other as much as possible before intervening . 
Such policy may be brutally effective in the short term ; in the long term , it is certain to be costly for Turkey . 
Meanwhile , in Russia , the further the economy plunges , the more defiant Putin becomes . 
The great unanswered question is how long Putin will be able to rely on nationalist kitsch to overwhelm Russians &quot; rational calculation of their interests . 
What is certain - as every recent example shows - is that , in an increasingly transparent and interdependent world , isolation is less a splendor than a blunder .
