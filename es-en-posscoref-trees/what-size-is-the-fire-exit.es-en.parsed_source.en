What Size is the Fire Exit ? 
BRUSSELS - The eurozone is being thrown into turmoil by a collective rush to the exits by investors . 
Yields on government debt of peripheral eurozone countries are skyrocketing , because investors do not really know what the risks are . 
Officials want to be reassuring . 
Investors should not worry , they argue , because the current bailout mechanism - the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) - has worked so far without any haircut for bondholders , and will continue to be applied until about 2013 . 
Only after that date would any new mechanism open the door for losses for private investors , and only for debt issued after that date . 
But markets do not trust this message - and for good reason : it is not credible , because it makes no economic sense . 
After all , the claim that the risk of loss will arise only for debt issued after the new crisis-resolution mechanism starts in 2014 implies that all debt issued until then is safe , and that insolvency can occur only in some distant future , rather than now , as in Greece and Ireland . 
In effect , EU officials are saying to investors , &quot; Whom do you believe - us or your own eyes ? &quot; 
Moreover , for too many investors , Portugal , with its poor growth prospects and insufficient domestic savings to fund the public-sector deficit , looks like Greece . 
The problems of Portugal and Spain might be less severe than those of Greece and Ireland , but this apparently is not enough to induce investors to buy their government debt . 
A danger these countries share is thus the acute danger of large-scale runs on their banking systems . 
So far , investors trying to exit first have been made whole . 
Holders of Greek debt maturing now are repaid courtesy of the € 110 billion bailout program , and holders of Irish bank bonds have been given a guarantee by the Irish government , whose promises have in turn been underwritten by the EFSF . 
The EFSF will also provide funds to ensure that Irish banks &quot; depositors can get their money back today . 
The problem with this approach is that it creates the wrong incentives . 
Investors have now learned that the first to sell will avoid losses . 
The situation resembles that of a crowded cinema with only one exit . 
Everyone knows that in case of fire , only the first to leave will be safe . 
So , if the exit is small , even the faintest whiff of smoke can trigger a stampede . 
For the financial market , the size of the exit depends on the funds available to make short-term investors whole . 
Unfortunately , the size of the EFSF looks inadequate to finance a collective exit by short-term investors . 
When the EFSF was created , it was assumed that the only problem was to ensure financing for the government deficits of the four prospective problem countries ( Portugal , Ireland , Greece , and Spain ) . 
From this perspective , the headline figure of € 750 billion allocated to the EFSF looked adequate . 
But the EFSF &apos;s founders did not take into account banks &quot; enormous short-term liabilities , which in a crisis effectively become government debt , as Ireland has been the most recent to demonstrate . 
The EFSF might be just enough to guarantee the public debt of the four problem countries , but certainly not their banking sectors &quot; liabilities as well . 
For example , the Spanish banking sector alone has short-term liabilities of several hundred billion euros . 
To return to the cinema analogy : investors know that the exit is not large enough to allow them all to squeeze through at the same time . 
So each one want to be among the first to get out . 
If this line is to be maintained , the exit door must immediately be made much wider , and huge fire extinguishers must be brandished . 
The International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank must show investors that they have enough funding to finance the simultaneous exit of all short-term investors . 
It could work . 
A show of overwhelming force might restore calm to the markets . 
The alternative is to change strategy and focus instead on investors &quot; incentives . 
Patient investors should be rewarded . 
In particular , they should be able to expect to be better off than those rushing to the exit . 
This approach depends on two major policy shifts . 
First , governments should not be pushed into insolvency just to save all banks . 
This means that the Irish government ( maybe the next one ) should demand that holders of bank bonds share the losses , perhaps by offering them a simple debt-equity swap . 
Doubts about the Irish government &apos;s solvency would then disappear quickly , and its guarantee of bank deposits would no longer look so shaky . 
Something similar might have to be done for the Spanish banking system &apos;s exposure to the local housing market . 
The second component of a permanent anti-crisis mechanism is a floor for bond prices - and thus a ceiling for losses . 
The yields and volatility of longer-term bonds should then fall relative to short-term securities , allowing peripheral governments to finance themselves reliably and at reasonable cost . 
None of this would resolve Europe &apos;s fundamental problems , namely weak fiscal positions , poorly functioning financial sectors , and lack of competitiveness .
