China &apos;s Silk Road Revival 
NEW DELHI - The phrase &quot; Silk Road &quot; evokes a romantic image - half history , half myth - of tented camel caravans winding their way across the trackless deserts and mountains of Central Asia . 
But the Silk Road is not just part of a fabled past ; it is an important feature of China &apos;s current foreign policy . 
The historical Silk Road comprised an overland and a maritime route , both of which facilitated the transfer to Europe of South and East Asian goods and ideas , from Chinese tea to inventions like paper , gunpowder , and the compass , as well as cultural products like Buddhist scripture and Indian music . 
Likewise , the Silk Road - primarily the overland route , which also passed through the Arab world to Europe - gave China access to Indian astronomy , plants , and herbal medicines , while introducing it to the Buddhist and Islamic faiths . 
Thanks to Chinese Admiral Zheng He , who steered his naval fleet across the Indian Ocean seven times in the early fifteenth century , the Chinese wok became the favorite cooking vessel of women in the southwestern Indian state of Kerala . 
Chinese fishing nets still dot the waters off Kochi . 
In 1411 , Zheng erected a stone tablet - translated into Chinese , Persian , and Tamil - near the Sri Lankan coastal town of Galle , with an inscription appealing to the Hindu gods to bless his efforts to build a peaceful world based on trade and commerce . 
Six hundred years later , Chinese President Xi Jinping is espousing a similar goal - only he is appealing to political leaders throughout Europe and Asia to advance his cause . 
In September of last year , in a speech at Kazakhstan &apos;s Nazarbayev University , Xi announced the so-called &quot; Silk Road Economic Belt , &quot; a new foreign-policy initiative aimed at boosting international cooperation and joint development throughout Eurasia . 
To guide the effort , Xi identified five specific goals : strengthening economic collaboration , improving road connectivity , promoting trade and investment , facilitating currency conversion , and bolstering people-to-people exchanges . 
The following month , the other shoe dropped . 
Xi , addressing Indonesia &apos;s Parliament , called for the re-establishment of the old sea networks to create a twenty-first century &quot; maritime Silk Road &quot; to foster international connectivity , scientific and environmental research , and fishery activities . 
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang subsequently reiterated that goal at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit , and again at the East Asia Summit last year . 
Since then , the establishment of a modern overland and maritime Silk Road has become official Chinese policy , endorsed by the Communist Party and the National People &apos;s Congress . 
Xi has emphasized that the goal of the Silk Road economic initiative is to revive ancient ties of friendship in the contemporary globalized world . 
But he undoubtedly has a domestic motive as well , rooted in the growing prosperity gap between eastern and western China . 
The concentration of economic activity in the cities and special economic zones of the east has generated energy-supply and environmental constraints and bottlenecks that are hampering China &apos;s ability to achieve the sustainable , inclusive growth that it needs to attain high-income status . 
The government hopes that the Silk Road initiative will make China &apos;s west and southwest regions the engines of the next phase of the country &apos;s development . 
Nonetheless , the initiative &apos;s international dimension remains the most relevant - and complex . 
Chinese diplomats have pointed to a constellation of mechanisms and platforms built or strengthened in recent years that could help maximize its impact . 
These include the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ; the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor ; the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ; the Chinese-built Yuxinou Railway from Chongqing to Germany ( and onward to north European ports ) ; and the new and incipient energy corridors between China and Central Asia , as well as Myanmar . 
Moreover , China has established the New Development Bank with its fellow BRICS members ( Brazil , Russia , India , and South Africa ) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank - institutions that will undoubtedly benefit from China &apos;s enormous investible surplus . 
Given China &apos;s prominent role in both , they could easily be used to provide financing for Silk Road-related programs . 
But , though China may not struggle to finance its Silk Road ambitions , it is likely to face political resistance - especially with regard to the maritime route . 
At a time when China &apos;s assertive stance in the South and East China Seas is provoking anxiety among its neighbors - including Japan , Vietnam , the Philippines , and Singapore - the Silk Road initiative has aroused significant geopolitical apprehension . 
In fact , these fears have a strong historical basis . 
Zheng &apos;s expeditions involved the use of military force in present-day Indonesia , Malaysia , Sri Lanka , and India to install friendly rulers and control strategic chokepoints across the Indian Ocean . 
He intervened in the dynastic politics of Sri Lanka and Indonesia , abducting and executing local rulers . 
He even seized the relic of the tooth of Buddha , a symbol of Sri Lankan political sovereignty . 
The countries along Zheng &apos;s route therefore recall his adventures not just as initiatives to promote trade and establish commercial links , but also as direct military intervention in their affairs , under the pretext of ushering in a harmonious world order under China &apos;s emperor . 
Reminding them of this painful past may not be entirely in China &apos;s interest . 
This is not to say that the modern Silk Road would benefit only China . 
On the contrary , its overland and maritime routes could attract considerable investment to participating countries - especially from China , as it seeks new avenues for deploying its vast reserves . 
But the modern Silk Road &apos;s establishment will also mark a step toward reinvigorating the ancient Chinese concept of tianxia , in which the Chinese emperor was considered the divinely appointed ruler of the entire known world . 
Many Asians still remember Japanese efforts before and during World War II to create a &quot; Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere &quot; - a self-sufficient bloc of countries , under Japan &apos;s leadership - through conquest . 
Might China be on a similar - albeit less openly aggressive - path ?
