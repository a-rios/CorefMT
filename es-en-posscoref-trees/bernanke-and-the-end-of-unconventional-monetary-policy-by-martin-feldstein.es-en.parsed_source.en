Decoding Bernanke 
CAMBRIDGE - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has been struggling to deliver a clear message about the future of Fed policy ever since his May 22 testimony to the US Congress . 
Indeed , two months later , financial-market participants remain confused about what his message means for the direction of US monetary policy and market interest rates . 
Bernanke &apos;s formal statements about the Fed &apos;s two unconventional policies have been clear . 
First , the Fed is trying to give relatively specific guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate ( the overnight rate at which commercial banks lend to each other ) . 
Second , the Fed is indicating the conditions that will cause it to start reducing its massive monthly bond-buying program and eventually bring it to an end . 
Bernanke has emphasized that these two policies are on separate tracks and will respond to different indicators of the economy &apos;s performance . 
The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , comprising the Fed governors and the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks , has agreed that the federal funds rate will remain at its current near-zero level until the unemployment rate drops to 6.5 % and can be expected to remain there or decline even further . 
With unemployment now at 7.6 % and falling only slowly , the Fed may not be ready to raise the federal funds rate until 2015 . 
But there are caveats that make this forward guidance ambiguous - and therefore uninformative . 
The Fed warns that it might increase the federal funds rate if the anticipated annual inflation rate rises from its current level of a bit less than 2 % to more than 2.5 % . 
There is no clue , however , about how that &quot; anticipated future inflation rate &quot; will be determined . 
So the Fed could , in principle , decide to raise the federal funds rate even before the unemployment rate reaches 6.5 % . 
Moreover , the Fed recognizes that a substantial part of the decline in the unemployment rate in the past year reflects the large number of people who stopped looking for work ( and who therefore are no longer counted as unemployed ) . 
So , if the unemployment rate is deemed to have fallen below 6.5 % because of continuing declines in labor-force participation , or because firms increase the relative number of part-time workers ( which would imply no increase in the aggregate number of hours worked ) , the Fed may not raise the federal funds rate . 
As a result , it is not surprising that the market is confused about the likely path of the federal funds rate over the next 24 months . 
And that is important , because a rise in the federal funds rate will cause other , somewhat longer interest rates to increase as well . 
The bigger policy uncertainty is about the more immediate prospect that the Fed may soon reduce its purchases of long-term assets - so-called quantitative easing . 
Bernanke continues to stress that shifts in the pace of bond buying will depend on how well the economy is doing . 
But he startled markets recently by saying that the FOMC &apos;s expected path of stronger growth could lead to a slower pace of buying later this year and an end to the asset purchases by mid-2014 . 
Bernanke justified his position by stating that quantitative easing is intended &quot; primarily to increase the near-term momentum of the economy , &quot; suggesting that stronger momentum would justify less asset buying . 
The reality , however , is that the economy &apos;s near-term momentum has actually been decreasing ever since quantitative easing began - and has decreased more rapidly as the size of the program has grown . 
The pace of real GDP growth fell from 2.4 % in 2010 to 2 % in the next four quarters , and then to 1.7 % in 2012 . 
The first official estimate of GDP growth in the second quarter of 2013 , to be released on July 31 , is likely to be less than 1 % , implying that annual GDP growth in the first half of this year was considerably slower than in 2012 . 
So what does this imply about the Fed &apos;s willingness to &quot; taper &quot; its pace of asset purchases ? 
Ironically , it might help to rationalize the decision to begin tapering before the end of the year . 
First , the lack of correlation between quantitative easing and GDP growth suggests that the pace of asset buying could be reduced without slowing the pace of growth . 
That is true even though , contrary to the assumption of Bernanke and some other FOMC members , interest rates will rise as the pace of purchases declines . 
Second , if the extreme weakness in the second quarter is followed by a return to a sluggish growth rate of around 2 % in the third quarter , the Fed could declare that it is observing the pick-up in growth that it has said is necessary to justify the beginning of tapering . 
The policy of extremely low long-term rates is now doing more harm than good by driving lenders and investors to take inappropriate risks in order to achieve higher returns . 
Bernanke and the FOMC should recognize this and gradually bring the bond-buying program to an end during the next 12 months . 
They can take credit for what quantitative easing has achieved without holding its termination hostage to the economy &apos;s future performance . 
It is significant that Bernanke will be stepping down at the beginning of 2014 . 
He did a remarkably good job in dealing with dysfunctional financial markets during the crisis years of 2008 and 2009 . 
When the financial markets were working again but the economy was still growing much too slowly , he turned to unconventional monetary policies to reduce long-term interest rates and accelerate the housing market &apos;s recovery . 
So , although the economy is now weaker than he or anyone else would like , he may want to complete his policy legacy by beginning the exit from unconventional policies before he leaves the Fed .
