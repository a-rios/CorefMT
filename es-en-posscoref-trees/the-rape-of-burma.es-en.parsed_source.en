The Rape of Burma 
SYDNEY - Burma , once the richest country in Southeast Asia , today is mired in deep poverty . 
Its economy ruined by nearly 50 years of economic mismanagement under military rule , the only international rankings that it tops are those for most corrupt nation , world &apos;s worst health system , and lowest spending on education - &quot; accolades &quot; that are sadly indicative of its people &apos;s suffering . 
And yet , over the last few years Burma has also emerged as a significant producer of energy in Southeast Asia . 
Thanks to large fields of recoverable natural gas located offshore , Burma now earns substantial foreign exchange revenues . 
At present , most of these revenues ( $ 1-1.5 billion per year , depending on price fluctuations ) come from Thailand . 
Gas from Burma , piped onshore from the Gulf of Martaban , generates around 20 % of Bangkok &apos;s electricity supply . 
If all goes well , new gas fields recently discovered in the Bay of Bengal will provide even more gas for China &apos;s Yunnan Province . 
To get the gas into Yunnan , a much longer pipeline - running the length of Burma - must be built . 
The project will be as difficult as it will be controversial . 
But , with no environmental or labor standards to contend with , few doubt that the pipeline will proceed . 
So , given its newfound energy riches , one might expect Burma &apos;s public finances to be rather flush , with surpluses aplenty to spend on health , education and much else that the country so desperately needs . 
Alas , almost none of Burma &apos;s gas revenues actually feed into its budget , owing to a rather ingenious device employed by the Burmese junta . 
The device is simple . 
Like many countries ruled by authoritarian regimes , Burma has a dual exchange rate system . 
The official exchange rate pegs Burma &apos;s currency , the kyat , at a rate of six to one against the US dollar . 
The informal or black market exchange rate determines the value of the kyat according to supply and demand in the marketplace . 
Trading kyat in the black market is formally illegal ( and Burma &apos;s regime loves rounding up foreign exchange dealers from time to time ) , but it is the only way that people unconnected to the regime can ever hope to come across foreign currency . 
According to the informal exchange rate , the kyat &apos;s worth is currently about 1,000 to one against the dollar . 
Given this dual exchange rate system , hiding Burma &apos;s gas earnings becomes easy . 
By recording earnings at the official exchange rate , they are worth nearly 200 times below what they should be . 
Thus , Burma &apos;s gas earnings of around $ 1.2 billion for 2006-07 are rendered into a mere 7.2 billion kyat in the country &apos;s public accounts - less than 1 % of the regime &apos;s official public spending . 
Recorded at the market exchange rate , however , these earnings translate into 1.2 trillion kyat - an amount large enough to eliminate Burma &apos;s budget deficit , as well as the destructively inflationary money printing that is the regime &apos;s preferred method of public finance . 
So where do Burma &apos;s generals hide all the money they keep away from the state &apos;s budget ? 
No one but the generals knows for sure . 
An inspection of the vaults of the country &apos;s Foreign Trade Bank might be a good place to start , however , as well as those of some accommodatingly unscrupulous banks offshore . 
Whatever the precise location of Burma &apos;s riches , these hoards enable the junta to spend at its whim . 
A nuclear reactor , a new capital city , military pay increases - all of these and more have been on the menu of late . 
The one group that almost certainly will not benefit from any of the largesse are the Burmese people themselves , who are entitled to it and for whom it would mean an end to lives of poverty and want .
