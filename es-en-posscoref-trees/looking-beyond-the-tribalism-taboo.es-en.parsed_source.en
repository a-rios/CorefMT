Looking Beyond the Tribalism Taboo 
A few days before Easter , people in Ghana , a heavily Christian country , were shocked by violence between members of the Dagomb , an Islamic tribe . 
Members of one extended family within the Dagomb organized the murder of the tribe &apos;s own chief . 
The killing caused Ghana &apos;s government to declare a national emergency , and triggered an outcry over the curse of tribalism . 
Africa has long suffered under the belief that passionate tribal attachments are inefficient , irresponsible , and inhumane . 
Ever since they colonized Africa , Europeans have railed against tribalism , whilst simultaneously pitting one tribe against another whenever this suited their purposes . 
In drawing Africa &apos;s internal borders , imperialists ignored tribal differences , leaving some densely populated countries , such as Nigeria , without a dominant tribe or splitting famously cohesive tribes , such as the Ewe , between two countries ( Ghana and Togo ) . 
By ignoring tribal affinities , Europeans hoped to create an Africa whose allegiance was to nation first and tribe second ( or not at all ) . 
Africa &apos;s independence leaders of the late 1950s and early 1960s essentially opposed tribal power . 
They sought to limit the authority of tribal chiefs and to use their powers over schools , land , and jobs to weaken , if not altogether eradicate , tribal consciousness . 
Ghana &apos;s Dagomb conflict illustrates why governments should tread carefully with tribal loyalties . 
The beheaded chief was appointed by Ghana &apos;s previous government in clear violation of traditional power structures . 
With a new government in power , the chief &apos;s enemies seized the opportunity to redress the wrong , providing a reminder of the perils of prior efforts to de-tribalize Africa . 
De-tribalization was always a doomed project . 
During my twenty years of working in aid and development in Africa , I have lived in and examined five countries : Ghana , Ethiopia , Sierra Leone , Sudan , and Egypt . 
All of their borders are works of European fiction , attempts to impose a monolithic image on areas honeycombed with diversity . 
In Ghana one does not find Ghanaians ; one finds Asante , Ewe , Ga , and Dagomb . 
In Ethiopia , rather than Ethiopians , you meet Amhars , Oromos , and Tigrinians . 
So it goes across the continent . 
Despite the best efforts of nationalists and pan-Africanists , nation-state identities have not taken root . 
African hearts beat to a tribal rhythm . 
People are more open about this than they once were , but a legacy of disapproval towards those who espouse tribal loyalties lingers . 
Yet these loyalties are deepening . 
Sub-Saharan Africa may be stuck with its political boundaries , but national identities remain less important than tribal ones . 
Colonialists and African independence leaders erred when they ignored tribal preferences , rather than celebrating them and making them the cornerstone of a healthy democracy . 
Tribes have their dark side , of course . 
Tribal claims by Hutus against Tutsis ( a rivalry long manipulated by Rwanda &apos;s colonial rulers ) incited genocide and still scar neighboring Burundi . 
In Nigeria , the Ibo - who fought Africa &apos;s first post-independence war of secession in the name of tribalism - remain an uneasy , defiant minority . 
Tribal affiliations powerfully influence political , social , and economic life in many other African countries as well . 
When decisions are made about who gets what aid in times of hardship , it is no surprise that ruling tribes get more than those out of power . 
Viewed through the rosy spectacles of nation-statehood , this may look like corruption . 
But from an ethnic point of view , those in power owe no allegiance to a nation-state identity . 
They have strong ties to their own peoples and it is their duty to ensure that they prosper before other tribes . 
Of the tribes who lack access to power , many are poorer today than at independence , despite the billions of dollars spent in their name . 
So foreigners ignore tribal loyalties at their peril . 
In Africa , the revival of ethnicity , which is the more civilized term that Westerners use to describe their own tribal allegiances , is at the core of social change today . 
In this regard , Africans are in step with the rest of the ethnocentric world . 
Failure to transcend tribalism suggests that Africans must learn to use their tribal loyalties for the good of their countries . 
Signs exist that this is happening . 
Many African nations are experimenting with ways of sharing power with tribal associations that often dominate local government . 
Africans living outside their home countries , especially those in the US or Europe , find that they often can effectively invest in their homelands by drawing on tribal ties . 
Consider the Ghanaian member of the FraFra tribe who returned from a period abroad intent on helping his group , which is a tiny minority in the country . 
The FraFra live a day &apos;s drive from Accra , Ghana &apos;s capital , and tend to be overlooked by the national government . 
The returnee has built schools and health clinics . 
He also insists that the local schools teach the FraFra language . 
Paradoxically , accepting the reality of tribal , or ethnic , power lays the foundation for national unity by letting each group first sort out its own priorities . 
Only then can members of different tribes interact with each other in a common space - and from a position of strength and respect .
