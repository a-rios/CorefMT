Brazil &apos;s Cautious Voters 
MEXICO CITY - Brazil has been in the global spotlight this year , and not always for the right reasons . 
Following the 2013 riots over the amount of money being spent on the 2014 soccer World Cup , protests continued up to , and even during , the tournament in June . 
There were dire - though ultimately misplaced - predictions about chaotic conditions for participants , and then , of course , the catastrophic performance of the home team . 
Now , the costs of the soccer jamboree , coming on top of the country &apos;s ongoing economic slowdown , are coming home to roost . 
Several analysts have concluded that Brazil &apos;s bubble has burst , and that the so-called &quot; country of the future &quot; will remain stuck in the present . 
Economic uncertainty is also dramatically affecting Brazilian politics . 
And a once placid , even predictable , presidential election campaign has been thrown into disarray by the death of the Brazilian Socialist Party candidate , Eduardo Campos , in an airplane crash in August . 
Campos &apos;s running mate , Marina Silva , was then nominated to take his place . 
A presidential candidate four years ago who ran on a green , socially conservative , but strongly pro-democratic platform , Silva received nearly 20 million votes . 
Her ties to Brazil &apos;s huge evangelical churches , and her unwillingness to break with them on issues such as abortion , same-sex marriage , and drug policy , alienate many voters . 
Nonetheless , she has rapidly overtaken Aécio Neves , the Social Democratic Party ( PSDB ) candidate , as the main challenger to Dilma Rousseff , the incumbent President and Workers &quot; Party ( PT ) candidate . 
A run-off between the two women , following the October 5th first round , seems inevitable , as opinion polls give neither close to 50 % of the vote . 
Though competent and tough , Rousseff faces voter fatigue after 12 years of PT rule , which many will remember , perhaps unfairly , for corruption scandals and the national team &apos;s 7-1 drubbing by Germany in this year &apos;s World Cup . 
But it is the government &apos;s dismal economic record over the past four years that is causing the biggest problems for Rousseff &apos;s campaign . 
At the same time , Silva will not be able to win the run-off without an enthusiastic and persuasive endorsement from Neves and the PSDB . 
Fortunately for Silva , the PSDB is highly critical of the PT administration , especially the foreign policy of Rousseff &apos;s predecessor , Luis Inácio Lula da Silva . 
PSDB-allied diplomats and former senior officials strongly have opposed the PT &apos;s support for Latin America &apos;s authoritarian regimes ( particularly in Cuba and Venezuela ) , its futile insistence on a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council , and its excessive embrace of non-aligned , anti-imperialist positions . 
A Silva victory would herald change in domestic and foreign policy alike . 
But perhaps its most remarkable impact would be cultural . 
Though she would not be the first woman president ( Rousseff broke the gender barrier ) or the first from humble origins ( Lula broke that taboo ) , she would be the first mulatto - darker-skinned than traditional Brazilian political leaders - to hold the office . 
Just as Lula &apos;s 2002 election signified a sea of change in a highly class-conscious , socially stratified society , Silva &apos;s election would shake up the racial order in a country - and indeed continent - where racism has not been eradicated . 
Indeed , in a country that has been proud of its supposedly non-racist nature , there has been no Afro-Brazilian politician of significant stature for a century . 
Despite the excitement aroused by her candidacy , however , Silva is unlikely to win . 
Since Latin America &apos;s democratization in the 1980s , only two incumbents have lost - Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua ( who was not really elected the first time ) and Hipólito Mejía in the Dominican Republic . 
More than a dozen incumbents have won re-election , more or less democratically . 
The incumbent &apos;s advantage in Latin America owes much to the feeble regulations restricting the government &apos;s use of the state apparatus for campaign purposes . 
The scope for abuse of power , public money , the media , and most state institutions available to sitting presidents makes it almost impossible to defeat them . 
Ultimately , Brazilians may just be too unsure about handing power to Silva , who has become a media phenomenon but remains an unknown quantity . 
Rousseff will probably be re-elected , not so much on the strength of her record as because voters fear the unfamiliar . 
That would be a pity . 
After all , most new political challengers appear unprepared for the top job until they are in power . 
But Brazilians may feel that they have already broken enough political barriers and taboos in recent years , and that Silva would represent one too many .
