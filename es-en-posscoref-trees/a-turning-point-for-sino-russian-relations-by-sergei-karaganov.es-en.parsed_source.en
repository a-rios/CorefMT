Xi in Russia 
MOSCOW - The atmospherics surrounding Xi Jinping &apos;s coming trip to Russia - his first visit to a foreign country as China &apos;s new president - remind me of a slogan from my early childhood in the late 1950 &quot; s : &quot; Russia-China , Friendship Forever . &quot; 
The irony is that , even in that slogan &apos;s heyday , Sino-Russian relations were deteriorating fast , culminating in spasms of combat along the Amur River in Siberia less than a decade later . 
Is that slogan more valid now ? 
After China opened up its economy and Russia emerged from the Soviet Union , bilateral relations entered a new stage . 
Goodwill now prevails , but some of the old suspicions linger - and some new ones have emerged . 
Xi &apos;s visit is not expected to usher in any breakthroughs . 
A few deals to export Russian hydrocarbons to China can be expected , but not much more . 
Nonetheless , the visit will highlight several important features of the bilateral relationship . 
For starters , both the Russian and Chinese governments can afford to downplay the significance of their ties with the United States . 
China views Russia as its strategic rear - and perhaps a base - in its escalating rivalry with the US ( though not yet as an ally ) . 
Russia &apos;s leaders view Sino-American competition as a welcome addition to their country &apos;s strategic weight , which , unlike China &apos;s , is not being augmented by robust economic growth . 
The more the US challenges the inevitable expansion of China &apos;s &quot; security perimeter , &quot; the better for Russia , or so the Kremlin &apos;s strategists appear to believe . 
Meanwhile , the Sino-Russian relationship has achieved an unprecedented degree of warmth . 
The Chinese are doing almost everything possible to placate Russian concerns . 
The old border disputes have been silenced . 
The volume of trade is growing rapidly . 
Moreover , there has been no Chinese demographic expansion into Siberia , though many journalists and pundits have been peddling that story . 
The number of Chinese residing in Russia - whether officially or clandestinely - amounts to 300,000 . 
Many more Chinese lived in the Russian Empire before the 1917 revolution . 
But , beneath the surface , unease in the bilateral relationship persists , partly for historical reasons . 
Nationalist Chinese remember imperial Russia &apos;s conquests , while many Russians have a morbid fear of the &quot; yellow peril , &quot; even though the Mongols conquered and reigned in China , while they were eventually repelled from Russia ( not to mention that the Chinese never invaded Russia ) . 
The more important reasons for the unease are the negative demographic trends in Russia &apos;s far-eastern Trans-Baikal region , and the fear - shared by all of China &apos;s neighbors - of overweening Chinese power . 
Indeed , the pundits have a point : if the current economic near-stagnation in Siberia persists , the world will witness a second , epic edition of Finlandization , this time in the east . 
That might not be the worst scenario a country could face , but it is not the most pleasant prospect for Russians , given their deeply ingrained sense of their status as a great power . 
This scenario is not inevitable , and it certainly will not be on the minds of Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin when they meet in Moscow . 
China is in the throes of an identity crisis as it faces an almost inevitable economic slowdown and the need to implement a new growth model . 
Russia , meanwhile , is clearly suffering from an even deeper identity crisis . 
It somehow survived the post-Soviet shock , and has now recovered . 
Yet , for the last six years or so , Russia has been in a kind of limbo , with no strategy , no goals , and no elite consensus on a vision for the future . 
For Sino-Russian relations , such fundamental uncertainties may be a blessing . 
Both leaders can count on the other not to create additional problems , and even to help passively on geopolitical questions . 
On Syria , for example , the two countries have shown that we are indeed living in a multipolar world . 
And those new oil and gas deals will buttress both economies . 
In the long term , Sino-Russian relations will depend largely on whether Russia overcomes its current stagnation and , among other steps , starts to develop the vast water and other resources of the Trans-Baikal region . 
To do so , capital and technology will be needed not only from China , but also from Japan , South Korea , the US , and Southeast Asian countries . 
The Trans-Baikal region could relatively easily expand ties with the resource-hungry Asian economies , to the benefit of all . 
Even the labor problem is solvable , with millions of workers from former Soviet Central Asia - and perhaps from a gradually liberalizing North Korea - able to take part in the ambitious development that will be needed . 
But the first step is to start to create conditions in the region that make living and working there attractive to Russians . 
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vladivostok last year created a mere enclave of development . 
A growth strategy for the whole region is yet to come . 
If it does not , the current Sino-Russian entente cordiale is almost certain to sour . 
Russia will start to feel vulnerable , and will be pushed toward either geopolitical brinkmanship or submission to China &apos;s will . 
At this point , however , relations between China and Russia appear to be far better than the mythical friendship of my childhood . 
Putin and Xi will do everything to emphasize that .
