Building Palestine From the Bottom Up 
JERUSALEM - As President Barack Obama &apos;s special Middle East envoy , former US Senator George Mitchell , learned during his visit to the region , America &apos;s efforts at Israeli-Palestinian peace-making are running up against three major obstacles . 
The first obstacle - indeed , the issue that stands front and center today - is the ongoing Palestinian civil war , with Hamas controlling the Gaza Strip in defiance of Abu Mazen &apos;s Fatah-led Palestinian Authority . 
The Palestinians &quot; basic failure at nation-building makes any meaningful peace talks with Israel - let alone an agreement - almost impossible at the moment . 
With Palestinians unable to agree among themselves on a minimal national consensus , how can peace be established between them and Israel ? 
Second , with Likud &apos;s Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister , Israel now has a government which is far less likely to be willing - or able - to make major concessions and evacuate hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers from the West Bank . 
Third , and most significantly , the 1993 Israel-PLO agreement has until now failed to achieve its aim . 
Attempts to revive the Oslo peace process - the &quot; Road Map &quot; and the Annapolis process - have similarly failed to achieve more than vacuous declarations and hollow photo opportunities . 
The causes of these 15 years of failure should be considered , so that Mitchell &apos;s mission does not become another stillborn effort . 
Both the Palestinians and Israel can easily and rightly be blamed for the failure of the Oslo process . 
But there is a more fundamental cause at stake , and it should not be overlooked . 
The Oslo process tried to build a Palestinian state from the top down : create a Palestinian national authority , hand over territory to it , give it increasing power , arm it and finance it , hold elections , and a Palestinian state would emerge . 
Instead , the consequence was a corrupt , militarized Palestinian Authority , with competing security services proved incapable of providing security . 
Nor could it conduct credible negotiations with Israel or deliver necessary services to ordinary Palestinians . 
Two reasons for this failure stand out : the institutional weakness of Palestinian civil society , which lacks the infrastructure necessary for nation-building ; and the impossibility of simultaneous nation-building and peace-making . 
There is no precedent anywhere in the world that suggests that such a two-tier process can succeed . 
A fundamental change of paradigm is needed : the effort should shift to building a Palestinian state from the bottom up , for which there are encouraging signs , even in the midst of the failure of the top-down process . 
In the last two years , former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US General Keith Dayton have succeeded in effective institution-building in three West Bank districts - Jenin , Bethlehem , and Hebron - turning them into the most peaceful areas in the West Bank , with a minimal Israeli military presence . 
Local authorities were supplied with adequate funding and advice ; independent chambers of commerce became the backbone of a local commercial middle class , which is interested in keeping the region peaceful , even absent an overall agreement ; local police were trained ( in Jordan ) , and now function effectively as police forces , not armed militias ; and business relations with adjacent Israeli regions have been renewed . 
This empowerment of an effective local leadership was done with much persistence - and little fanfare . But these nuts-and-bolts projects created - for the first time - the building blocks necessary for effective Palestinian nation-building . 
Admittedly , this process will take time and patience . 
As Blair recently put it , such a bottom-up process may even go hand-in-hand with Netanyahu &apos;s goal of an &quot; economic peace , &quot; though it would eventually have to go beyond it . 
That such an approach would have to include a total halt to Israeli settlement activities goes without saying . 
If carefully crafted , it may even be implicitly accepted , albeit without much enthusiasm , by the Israeli government . 
The Oslo process has failed ; an attempt to revive it - say , by way of the Beirut Arab peace initiative - will merely bring into the open all of the existing disagreements between the two sides , and will not overcome the Palestinian failure at nation-building . 
After all the breakdowns in efforts to create a Palestinian state from the top down , only the old-fashioned way - from the bottom up - remains viable .
