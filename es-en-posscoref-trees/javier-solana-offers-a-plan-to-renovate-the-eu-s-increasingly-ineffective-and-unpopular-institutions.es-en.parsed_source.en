Re-Winning Europe 
MADRID - The European Parliament election revealed the full extent of voters &quot; frustrations , discontent , and lack of confidence in both the European Union and their national governments . 
The EU &apos;s institutions will now confront a legislature marked by growing disaffection , while rising Euroskepticism is bound to have a profound impact on national policies . 
If the EU is to retain public loyalty , it must listen up and proceed to action . 
A program of strategic priorities is in order . 
No doubt , the economy must come first . 
Much progress has been made on new instruments of integration , such as the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) and the banking union . 
But much more remains to be done . 
The incoming European Commission must boldly stimulate economic growth and employment , so that southern European countries can reconcile their deficit- and debt-reduction goals with policies targeting growth . 
Ultimately , only the latter will allow for long-term fiscal sustainability . 
The Commission must also launch active labor-market policies to reduce unemployment , above all for young people . 
The recovery of dynamism , demand , and consumption depends on its success . 
No pro-growth policy is as important as stimulating public and private research and development . 
The EU should , for example , allow R &amp; D spending ( and some spending on active labor-market policies targeting young people ) to be left out of member states &quot; deficit accounting . 
This principle has been applied to aid to the financial sector ; it is no less appropriate for investment . 
And , on the revenue side , Europe needs a minimum of fiscal homogeneity , at least in terms of corporate taxation , in order to avoid a race to the bottom . 
Now that the worst of the euro crisis seems to have passed , it is also vital to fix the deficiencies in the monetary union &apos;s institutional design . 
The progress made on the banking union is important , but two key components are still needed : first , a true rehabilitation of the European banking system to ensure that credit flows resume throughout the eurozone , while averting deflation ; and , second , debt mutualization to protect vulnerable countries from market gyrations . 
The European Central Bank &apos;s role is fundamental for both , as well as in continuing to promote growth ( both through expansionary monetary policy and by facilitating market access for countries whose financing still depends on the ECB &apos;s implicit guarantee ) . 
But Europe must address more than just the economy , for the world will not stop and wait . 
The opportunity to reconsider European foreign policy is clear . 
And , here , Europe &apos;s vision should center on the challenges confronting its three neighboring regions . 
Europe &apos;s eastern neighborhood is marked by the crisis in Ukraine . 
Following Russia &apos;s illegal annexation of Crimea , and further Russian revanchism in eastern Ukraine , relations with Putin &apos;s Kremlin need to be reconsidered . 
Geographic proximity , historical ties , and energy dependence make Russia a key partner for the future of Europe , but Putin &apos;s foreign policy poses a direct challenge to European security and unity . 
Meanwhile , Europe &apos;s southern neighborhood is still caught up in a highly uncertain process of sociopolitical transition . 
In some cases - such as Tunisia - the process has been successful ; elsewhere , as in Syria , the course of events has been discouraging , to say the least . 
To some extent , Europe seems to have abandoned the Mediterranean &apos;s southern shore , compensated in part by flows of economic aid from the Gulf countries . 
For the Arab world , which was previously reluctant to display such solidarity - witness Palestine , where European money sustains basic services - this is a welcome novelty . 
Nonetheless , it will be difficult for North Africa to recover without greater EU involvement . 
Europe &apos;s third neighborhood - and the most difficult to manage - stems from interdependence , which makes the entire world Europe &apos;s neighbor . 
Economic , political , and social ties , not geography , determine this neighborhood &apos;s ever-shifting borders , within which are Europe &apos;s most important partners , from the United States to China to other emerging countries and non-state actors . 
Managing them requires a clear position in favor of global governance and effective multilateralism at all levels . 
For Europe , interdependence is strongly correlated with energy security . 
Making progress toward an energy union is crucial and should be one of the new Commission &apos;s main objectives . 
A common energy policy must be based on the single market and collective planning of investment , while also accounting for the mix of sources and purchases from third parties . 
This presupposes not only truly EU-wide regulation - which is , at present , excessively intergovernmental due to the design of the EU &apos;s Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators - but also more infrastructure , including electrical lines and gas pipelines , connecting member states to one another . 
This will require more rapid execution of the Trans-European Energy Networks ( TEN-E ) . 
Moreover , the EU should contemplate centralizing the purchase of energy from third parties , as proposed by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk . 
At the very least , greater transparency in individual member states &quot; third-party purchases is needed . 
For example , today purchase contracts between companies in various member states and Russia &apos;s state-owned gas giant Gazprom are confidential . 
In this process of energy integration , the banking union offers clues about how to secure common interests and maintain a balance among the EU &apos;s main institutions - the European Commission , the European Parliament , the European Council , and the ECB . 
Such concerns should also guide the new Commission in the design of a common migration policy , one that not only silences the xenophobes , but that also gives coherence to the border-free Schengen Area - one of Europe &apos;s greatest achievements . 
The EU &apos;s institutions need to revitalize themselves and recover the support of Europe &apos;s citizens . 
They must demonstrate their efficiency , capacity to innovate , and ability to invigorate the continent with renewed dynamism and drive . 
Setting the right priorities is the first , critical step .
