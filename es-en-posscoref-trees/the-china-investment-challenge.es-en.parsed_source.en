The China Investment Challenge 
NEW YORK - China now sits atop $ 2.4 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves , the largest stockpile of any country in the world ( Japan stands in second place with $ 1 trillion ) . 
But this bounty comes with one big headache : where should Chinese Communist Party officials park all that money ? 
International bankers estimate that roughly two-thirds of Chinese reserves have been invested in dollar assets . 
In other words , China owns a huge chunk of America &apos;s ballooning debt . 
Chinese reserves invested in these conservative financial instruments are relatively safe , but they yield little return . 
They have , however , helped support China &apos;s economy by allowing Americans to run up consumer debt by buying more Chinese goods than they rightfully need . 
A moment of truth is looming for both sides of this co-dependent , and ultimately dysfunctional , economic relationship . 
First , there are limits to how many trillions of dollars China can , and should , put into US Treasury bills . 
After all , should the dollar depreciate , China does not want to have too many eggs in the US basket . 
Investors should diversify their risk , and so must China . 
But with so much capital , the options are limited . 
Until the euro weakened recently , Chinese bankers had been buying more euro-denominated assets , no doubt recognizing that , despite the frailty of the eurozone economy , Chinese exporters also need European consumers to keep buying their goods . 
But the reality is that neither the euro nor the yen is capable of soaking up China &apos;s growing foreign-exchange reserves . 
It is hardly surprising , then , that Chinese officials have begun to seek more diverse and profitable investment possibilities worldwide . 
While we have become familiar with China &apos;s ardent interest in natural resources such as oil , coal , steel , copper , and soybeans , we are far less acquainted with other kinds of Chinese investments , including outright acquisitions of foreign companies . 
Here the US has not yet shown itself to be a particularly hospitable environment for Chinese investments . 
This has been especially true when Chinese state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) have aspired to buy , or buy into , iconic US corporations that have a blush of national-security significance about them . 
Things got off to a poor start in 2005 , when the China National Off-Shore Oil Corporation ( CNOOC ) tried to buy Unocal . 
Even though almost all of the oil produced by Unocal would have ended up on world markets rather than back in China , the US Congress &apos;s skittishness assured that Unocal was sold to homegrown Chevron . 
Although Chinese investors have since made numerous lower-visibility plays in US markets , the failed Unocal deal left a legacy of bitterness . 
So it is hardly surprising that gun-shy ( and miffed ) Chinese investors are wary about making further major efforts in the US . 
Huawei &apos;s recent failed bids for 2Wire and Motorola will only have rekindled this bitterness . 
Indeed , a case similar to Unocal arose this summer . 
The Anshan Iron and Steel Group , a Chinese SOE , tried to buy a 20 % interest in the Mississippi-based Steel Development in the hope of setting up a re-bar plant in the US . 
News of the pending deal caused 50 Congressional Representatives from the US steel caucus to write a letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner calling for an investigation of the threat the deal posed to US national security and American jobs . 
When it comes to China , the US does , of course , have legitimate reasons to worry about national-security issues . 
It was precisely to assess the impact of deals with countries like China on national security that Congress established the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US . 
Even though relations with the US have improved , the People &apos;s Republic is far from being trusted . 
Indeed , it is still unclear where China &apos;s amazing evolution will ultimately lead , so it would be na√Øve for American leaders to assume that China &apos;s intentions will always be friendly and constructive , or that the two countries are inevitably destined to grow closer . 
Nonetheless , this most recent spurning of Chinese efforts to invest in the US comes at a time when capital-poor and job-scarce America ( where unemployment is over 10 % ) could truly benefit from more receptivity to investment from capital-rich China . 
Consider a few facts . 
According to The Wall Street Journal , since December 2007 , the US has lost 16 % of its manufacturing jobs ( many to China ) , leaving it with the lowest employment in this sector since before World War II . 
Of those workers still in the private sector , almost 5 % , or 5.5 million , are employed by global companies whose headquarters are abroad . 
These same companies not only pay higher salaries than their American counterparts , but account for 11.3 % of capital investment in the US and provide 14.8 % of its private-sector R D. 
Given this , one might think the US government would be actively courting Chinese investment , not scaring it away unnecessarily . 
If American officials do not begin to recognize the realities of today &apos;s globalized world , the US may unwittingly ( and self-destructively ) find itself cut off from the kinds of new foreign investment flows that are sorely needed to revitalize its manufacturing and infrastructure sectors . 
The bitter new reality is that the US and &quot; old Europe &quot; have recently edged closer to becoming &quot; developing countries . &quot; 
Indeed , it may be a painful recognition , but America &apos;s share of worldwide foreign direct investment is now half of what it was two decades ago . 
If the Obama administration and EU officials cannot figure out the proper mix between economic engagement and protecting national security , investment capital from China will go elsewhere . 
That is a strategy that will leave the US and the EU weaker , not stronger .
