The Chávez Way 
LONDON - I remember the exact date of my visit to Venezuela . 
I was sunbathing by the pool on the roof of the Caracas Hilton . 
A waiter came up to me and mumbled something about a bomb attack in New York . 
I rushed to my room and saw the news footage , endlessly replayed , of two airplanes crashing into the World Trade Center . 
I was in Venezuela on September 11 , 2001 , to attend a conference on the &quot; Third Way . &quot; 
Hugo Chávez was very interested in the Third Way - a modus vivendi between American-style capitalism and state socialism - as had been Tony Blair a few years earlier . 
Chávez himself , dressed in fatigues , briefly graced the meeting with his presence , receiving a heavy volume of Marxist texts from an elderly professor . 
A day earlier , I had had lunch at the Venezuelan central bank , sitting next to the deputy governor , Gastón Parra Luzardo . 
He told me that all Venezuelans believed that they had been born with a &quot; loaf under their arm &quot; - that is , a right to a share in the country &apos;s oil revenues . 
As a result , no one worked hard . 
An economist , Orlando Ochoa , explained that rent-seeking dominated the Venezuelan economy . 
Oligarchs fight to keep control over the oil revenues , populists promise to redistribute them , and both groups steal as much as they can for themselves . 
No one is interested in creating wealth . 
&quot; No one , &quot; I wrote in my diary , &quot; believes that Chávez will last his full term . 
They see him as a damaging buffoon , rather than as a dangerous revolutionary . &quot; 
In fact , a coup against him was attempted a year later . 
He survived it , and went on to win a second , a third , and then a fourth term . 
The debate over Chávez &apos;s political legacy is a posthumous re-enactment of the ideological battles that were fought while he was alive . 
The battle for his economic legacy is more straightforward : it comes down to how he managed Venezuela &apos;s oil wealth . 
Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world , and Chávez &apos;s economic strategy depended on harnessing that wealth in order to address his country &apos;s social problems . 
The first few years of his rule were dominated by his struggle to gain control of the country &apos;s state-owned oil company , PDVSA . 
Upon reasserting political control in 2003 , Chávez fired 40 % of PDVSA &apos;s staff . 
His hostility to foreign players in the industry ( he expropriated several American oil companies &quot; holdings in 2007 ) limited investment and held back production . 
Chávez turned PDVSA into a personal fiefdom and used it as a cash cow ; many of his social programs were funded directly from the company &apos;s budget . 
Starved of cash , PDVSA was forced to cut back on maintenance and expansion , which increased the number of accidents and limited production . 
Thanks partly to Chávez &apos;s policies , Venezuela is still a small player in the global oil market , with less than a 3 % share of world production . 
It is therefore vulnerable to price fluctuations , and has to follow the lead of Saudi Arabia and other big OPEC producers . 
Though Venezuela &apos;s non-oil sector has been growing , oil still provides the vast majority of its dollar earnings . 
For the past decade , booming oil prices have spurred economic expansion , with only a short break following the financial crisis of 2008 . 
Yet stumbling oil-export performance and a sharp rise in infrastructure-related imports , combined with an explosive growth in public spending , have fueled consistently high levels of inflation , with the annual rate now at more than 20 % . 
This has put immense pressure on Venezuela &apos;s dollar-pegged currency , the bolívar . 
In early 2013 , the government was forced to announce a 32 % devaluation , and stopped issuing government debt in dollars . 
The issuance of dollar bonds was a major source of abuse , with speculators buying dollar debt at the official exchange rate , selling it for greenbacks , and then exchanging them for bolivars at a much higher rate on the black market . 
With limited access to global capital markets , Chávez turned to China for loans , backed by sales contracts for oil . 
Loans from the China Development Bank carry higher interest rates than the West &apos;s traditional lending mechanisms , but they also come with fewer restrictions on policy , and allowed Venezuela to escape the worst of the bondholders &quot; wrath - at least so far . 
Where has the oil wealth gone ? 
Chávez &apos;s social programs were the biggest beneficiaries . 
He used to go around the villages writing checks to poor farmers . 
The most reliable data suggest that he was successful at reducing inequality ; during his rule , Venezuela &apos;s Gini coefficient , a 100-point scale measuring income inequality , fell from 50 to 39 , the biggest decline in Latin America . 
Poverty was cut in half - from 50 % to around 25 % of the population , while extreme poverty fell by two-thirds . 
One can hardly say that every céntimo was well spent . 
Cronyism was rife and the murder rate tripled , partly owing to corruption in the police and the justice system . 
Chávez &apos;s petro-diplomacy sometimes took bizarre forms , like providing cheap bus travel for Londoners to please London &apos;s left-wing mayor , Ken Livingstone . 
Despite his extravagancies and authoritarian style , the masses loved him . 
They fervently believed that he was on their side , and voted overwhelmingly for him up to the end , even when they knew that he was dying of cancer . 
He is sure to enter the pantheon of Latin American heroes . 
And what about the Third Way ? 
In the aftermath of the collapse of communism , Chávez &apos;s mix of anti-Americanism and state activism seemed merely eccentric . 
There could be no alternative to free markets and the neoliberal Washington Consensus - or so it appeared . 
But the rise of China , the relative decline of the United States , the long boom in commodity prices , and the Western financial collapse of 2008 have created space for political and economic experiments . 
Chávez took advantage of that opening , and Chávezism may well prove to be a significant phenomenon far beyond its Latin American homeland .
