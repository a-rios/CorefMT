Russia and the Kosovo Card 
TBILISI - Look before you leap is as sound a principle in foreign policy as it is in life . 
Yet , once again , the Bush administration is preparing to leap into the unknown . 
Even though lack of foresight is universally viewed as a leading cause of its Iraq debacle , the United States ( with British backing probable ) is now preparing to recognize Kosovo &apos;s independence unilaterally - irrespective of the consequences for Europe and the world . 
Kosovo has been administered since 1999 by a United Nations mission guarded by NATO troops , although it remains formally a part of Serbia . 
But , with Kosovo &apos;s ethnic Albanian majority demanding its own state , and with Russia refusing to recognize UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari &apos;s plan for conditional independence , the US is preparing to go it alone . 
Instead of thinking what Ahtisaari deemed unthinkable , a partition of Kosovo with a small part of the north going to Serbia and the rest linked to the Kosovars ethnic brethren in Albania or a separate state , the US plans to act without the UN &apos;s blessing , arguing that only an independent Kosovo will bring stability to the Western Balkans . 
That argument is debatable - and the record of the Kosovar government suggests that it is wrong . 
But the US position is unambiguously misguided in not foreseeing that the &quot; Kosovo precedent &quot; will incite instability and potentially even violence elsewhere . 
Why the rush to give Kosovo independence ? 
Many serious disputes have gone unresolved for decades . 
The Kashmir question has lingered since 1947 , the Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus since 1974 , and Israel &apos;s occupation of the West Bank from 1967 . 
Yet no one is suggesting that unilateral solutions be imposed in these potential flashpoints . 
Nevertheless , the US - and most European Union members - argue that Kosovo &apos;s situation is sui generis and will set no legally binding international precedent . 
But Russia sees things very differently . 
Indeed , it may seek to use this precedent to re-establish its authority over the nations and territories that were once part of the Soviet Union . 
Spain and Cyprus with their worries over secessionist-minded regions , are worried by any possible precedent . 
Romania fears the fallout from Kosovo &apos;s unilaterally gaining independence on neighboring Moldova . 
The worry is that Russia will unilaterally recognize the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transdnistria , which Russian troops and criminal gangs have been propping up for 16 years . 
Ukraine - the great prize in Russia &apos;s bid to recapture its former sphere of influence - is also deeply anxious . 
It fears that Russia will encourage separatist tendencies in Crimea , where the ethnic Russian population forms a majority . 
( Crimea was ceded to Ukraine by Nikita Khrushchev only in 1954 ) . 
Russia may decide to abuse the Kosovo precedent further to divide Ukraine &apos;s population between Russian speakers and Ukrainian speakers . 
But the biggest risks posed by unilateral recognition of Kosovo &apos;s independence are in the South Caucasus , a region that abuts the tinderbox of today &apos;s Middle East . 
Here , there is a real danger that Russia may recognize breakaway regions in the South Caucasus , - and back them more strongly than it does now . 
Even before Vladimir Putin became Russia &apos;s president , the Kremlin was making mischief in Georgia , issuing Russian passports to citizens of Abkhazia ( the largest breakaway region ) and pouring money into its economy . 
Russia &apos;s supposed &quot; peacekeeping troops &quot; in Abkhazia and South Ossetia , Georgia &apos;s other secession-minded region , have in fact protected their rebel governments . 
Russia has also been enforcing a complete trade embargo on Georgia in the hope of weakening the resolve of its pro-Western president , Mikhail Saakashvili . 
Should Russia recognize Abkhazia &apos;s independence , Saakashvili might be tempted to respond militarily to prevent his country from unraveling . 
Renewed conflict in Abkhazia would not only bring the risk of open warfare with Russia , but strain relations with Armenia , as there are near to 50,000 Armenians in Abkhazia who support the breakaway government . 
Another risk in the South Caucasus is that Russia ( with Armenian support ) will recognize Nagorno-Karabakh &apos;s self-proclaimed independence from Azerbaijan . 
Nagorno-Karabakh , historically Armenian , endured a bloody secessionist war between1988 and 1994 , with 30,000 killed and 14 % of Azerbaijan &apos;s territory occupied by Russian-backed Armenian forces . 
Since then , oil has fuelled an Azeri military buildup . 
Moreover , it has neighboring Turkey on its side . 
Turkey is already enforcing a punitive economic embargo on Armenia , including closure of its border . 
Military projections by the US have repeatedly suggested that Azerbaijan would lose such a battle , even with newly purchased equipment and Turkish military support . 
Armenian forces are well dug in and have received a significant boost from Russia &apos;s diversion of heavy weaponry to Armenia from some recently closed Georgian military bases . 
Iran also must be factored into this equation , as it is becoming a strategic investor by building an oil refinery just across its border in Armenia , partly as a security measure in case of a US attack and partly to relieve its petrol shortages . 
Moreover , Iran remains eager to contain Azerbaijani revanchist claims over the large Azeri minority in northern Iran . 
The conflicts in Transdnistria and the South Caucasus are usually called &quot; frozen conflicts , &quot; because not much has happened since they began in the early 1990 &quot; s . 
Any unilateral move to give Kosovo its independence is likely to unfreeze them - fast and bloodily . 
And such potential bloodshed on Russia &apos;s border may give Vladimir Putin the pretext he may desire to extend his rule beyond its constitutionally mandated end next March .
