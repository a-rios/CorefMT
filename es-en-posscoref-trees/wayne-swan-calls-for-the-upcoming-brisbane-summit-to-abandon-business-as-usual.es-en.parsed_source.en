The G-20 to the Rescue ? 
BRISBANE - The G-20 &quot; s upcoming meeting in Brisbane , Australia , comes at a time when a precarious global economy requires big decisions to be made . 
Economic data reveal that the global economy is shakier than at any time in the past two years . 
Capitalism is struggling to generate adequate demand . 
Wealth and income have become increasingly concentrated , while middle-class incomes in the developed world have stagnated . 
Tax avoidance by multinational companies is draining developing-country incomes , limiting their ability to invest in education and infrastructure . 
Many leading economists and policymakers are forecasting continued economic gloom . 
Stephen Roach has suggested that in the post-crisis global economy &quot; relapse is the rule &quot; ; economist Brad DeLong , speaking of the &quot; consequences of our lesser depression , &quot; argues that the pretense of a eurozone recovery has collapsed ; and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has acknowledged the need not only for structural reform , but also fiscal expansion to boost aggregate demand . 
At the heart of their concerns is the lack of sustained demand needed to drive growth . 
While structural reforms - particularly on the supply side - are required in developed and developing countries , they are not sufficient to address what former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has called &quot; secular stagnation &quot; - that is , the difficulty of sustaining sufficient demand to permit normal levels of output . 
The G-20 &quot; s central task , therefore , must be to establish a framework for strong and sustainable growth . 
Member states need to introduce reforms aimed at achieving a 2 % annual growth target , as agreed earlier this year by finance ministers . 
One structural reform that could drive global growth is substantial infrastructure investment in developing and developed countries alike . 
Unfortunately , no G-20 leader has seriously articulated this need , let alone lobbied for a solution . 
Apart from a World Bank presentation for a possible pilot infrastructure program , there is little to suggest how the 2 % target could be met over the medium term . 
G-20 governments , especially those with strong balance sheets , should be calling for large-scale public and private infrastructure investment to expand the productive capacity of member economies . 
In the area of tax avoidance , discussion needs to broaden beyond developed economies ; as the International Monetary Fund recently pointed out , developing economies &quot; budgets are disproportionately affected by multinational companies &quot; savvy accounting strategies . 
Unfortunately , judging by the initiatives already on the Brisbane agenda , the summit looks set to take a business-as-usual approach . 
If the G-20 fails to put policy meat on its rhetorical bones , it will risk looking weak and irrelevant . 
Its very credibility is on the line . 
Indeed , some in the developed world would prefer a smaller , more exclusive body - a G-14 or even a new G-7 . 
Such a move would hurt the developing world , especially the Asia-Pacific region , including Australia . 
One reason why some want a tighter group is that the G-20 struggles to achieve consensus . 
But this misses the point : It is harder to reach agreement precisely because all of the key leaders ( representing around two-thirds of the world &apos;s population and 80 % of global GDP ) , whose support is needed for any truly global decision , are in the room . 
The Brisbane Summit therefore needs to rediscover the activism that it displayed in 2008 and 2009 , during the height of the financial crisis . 
It must be led by the United States and other advanced economies , and backed up by major emerging economies . 
Australia , as host , also has a role to play . 
The country is respected by developed and developing countries alike , often bridging the interests of both , and is widely viewed as an honest broker . 
Unfortunately , the current government has had little to say about the big structural problems that underlie the world &apos;s economic malaise . 
The modest initiatives on the table reflect the government &apos;s anti-public-sector rhetoric . 
Worse , as developed and developing countries are starting to take climate change seriously , Australia is moving in the opposite direction . 
The Brisbane summit will be a crucial test for Australia , the G-20 , and the possibility of truly global policy coordination .
