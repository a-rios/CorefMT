Psychotherapists Rediscover the Brain 
When I trained as a clinical psychologist during the 1980s at a well-regarded American university , there was little mention of neuroscience . 
Given the brain &apos;s central role in human experience , I found this unsettling . 
After a few years in practice I began to explore the seemingly empty scientific space between the brain and psychotherapy . 
I discovered that before Sigmund Freud founded psychoanalysis , he was deeply interested in neurology . 
In a paper entitled &quot; Project for a Scientific Psychology , &quot; he proposed to examine the neural structures underlying human experience . 
Freud included crude diagrams of neural 
Hostile reactions from his colleagues convinced Freud to suppress the paper , which was published only after his death fifty years later . 
During the 20 th century , psychoanalysis and other branches of psychotherapy parted company with neurology , developing a rich metaphoric language of the mind that paid little attention to the brain and nervous system . 
Simultaneously , the neurosciences built a deep store of knowledge about the brain &apos;s relationship to observable behavior . 
Cultural and religious beliefs also contributed to this scientific division by holding that conscious experience must somehow arise and exist independently of the human body . 
This dualism of human spirit and physical body implied that brain-based explanations for problems affecting motor movement and language were possible , but that personality , feelings , and beliefs existed in the realm of the spirit . 
Thus , psychotherapy and the neurosciences traditionally maintained their own departments , world-views , and languages , viewing each other with suspicion and distrust . 
Another barrier to their collaboration has been that the brain is widely viewed as a static entity , determined by genetic preprogramming and early childhood experience . 
Based on this dogma , students of both fields were taught that neural plasticity , or the ability of the nervous system to grow and change , was extremely limited after childhood . 
Freud had to abandon this pessimistic view of the brain to pursue the idea that his &quot; talking cure &quot; could alter neural connections and change the nature of psychological experience . 
He was right to do so . 
The human brain and nervous system , it turns out , are built and sculpted , neuron by neuron , through the interaction of our particular genes and experiences , in what is called use-dependent development . 
We now know , for example , that all learning and memory are encoded within the nervous system , and that it is this learning that organizes the neural architecture and functioning of the brain . 
Every experience , from moving a toe to deep states of meditation , is stored in and organized by the electrochemical signaling within and between neurons . 
Changing our minds , by definition , changes our brains . 
During childhood , the growth and organization of the brain occurs in parallel with the rapid development of a wide range of skills and abilities . 
But the brain continues to react to its environment and remains plastic , to some degree , throughout life . 
Researchers are currently focusing on the underlying genetic and biochemical processes that generate new neurons and stimulate existing ones to change and grow . 
There is hope across all clinical fields that deal with disorders of the nervous system that these discoveries will lead to greater understanding of brain functioning and radically improved treatment . 
Psychotherapy attempts to create a learning environment that targets specific skills and abilities - organized by the same neural systems that neuroscientists are in the process of discovering - to induce changes in thinking , feeling , and behavior . 
Obviously , this new perspective radically re-defines psychotherapy . 
If the goal of therapy is to alter thoughts , behaviors , and feelings , then psychotherapists are attempting to change the physical architecture of the brains of their clients . 
If all of this is true , psychotherapy succeeds to the extent that it activates and enhances the lifelong processes of neural plasticity . 
From this perspective , psychotherapy is an enriched interpersonal environment , tailored to encourage the growth and integration of neural networks regulating memory , cognition , emotion , and attachment . 
Despite psychotherapy &apos;s historical lack of attention to the brain , the invisible hand of neural plasticity has guided its development - and the therapist has always been an unsuspecting neuroscientist . 
Findings in neuroscience are now beginning to support this connection . 
For example , psychotherapists &apos; supposedly &quot; unscientific &quot; use of language and emotional attunement may actually provide the best medium for some types of neural growth and integration . 
The human brain has evolved in tandem with spoken language in social contexts , so it is logical to believe that emotion-laden interpersonal dialogue may well stimulate the brain to learn . 
Interpersonal neurobiology , a new field combining developmental psychology , evolutionary biology , and genetics , seeks to understand how relationships throughout life are translated into the structure and function of the nervous system . 
Our research tools and theories remain primitive relative to the complexity of the human brain and there are few definitive answers about the causes and treatment of mental illness . 
Future advances will require the interaction of laboratory research , clinical case studies , and the imagination of creative thinkers . 
Freud &apos;s brand of psychoanalysis has fallen on hard times , but he would be the first to endorse the widening dialogue between psychotherapy and neuroscience .
