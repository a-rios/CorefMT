Lost in Transition 
WASHINGTON , DC - Financial markets and the news media have one thing in common : they tend to oscillate rapidly between hype and gloom . 
Nowhere is this more apparent than in analyses of emerging economies &quot; prospects . 
In the last few months , enthusiasm about these countries &quot; post-2008 economic resilience and growth potential has given way to bleak forecasts , with economists like Ricardo Hausmann declaring that &quot; the emerging-market party &quot; is coming to an end . 
Many now believe that the recent broad-based growth slowdown in emerging economies is not cyclical , but a reflection of underlying structural flaws . 
That interpretation contradicts those ( including me ) who , not long ago , were anticipating a switchover in the engines of the global economy , with autonomous sources of growth in emerging and developing economies compensating for the drag of struggling advanced economies . 
To be sure , the baseline scenario for the post-crisis &quot; new normal &quot; has always entailed slower global economic growth than during the pre-2008 boom . 
For major advanced economies , the financial crisis five years ago marked the end of a prolonged period of debt-financed domestic consumption , based on wealth effects derived from unsustainable asset-price overvaluation . 
The crisis thus led to the demise of China &apos;s export-led growth model , which had helped to buoy commodity prices and , in turn , bolster GDP growth in commodity-exporting developing countries . 
Against this background , a return to pre-crisis growth patterns could not reasonably be expected , even after advanced economies completed the deleveraging process and repaired their balance sheets . 
But developing countries &quot; economic performance was still expected to decouple from that of developed countries and drive global output by finding new , relatively autonomous sources of growth . 
According to this view , healthy public and private balance sheets and existing infrastructure bottlenecks would provide room for increased investment and higher total factor productivity in many developing countries . 
Technological convergence and the transfer of surplus labor to more productive tradable activities would continue , despite the advanced economies &quot; anemic growth . 
At the same time , rapidly growing middle classes across the developing world would constitute a new source of demand . 
With their share of global GDP increasing , developing countries would sustain relative demand for commodities , thereby preventing prices from reverting to the low levels that prevailed in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
Improvements in the quality of developing countries &quot; economic policies in the decade preceding the global financial crisis - reflected in the broad scope available to them in responding to it - reinforced this optimism . 
Indeed , emerging countries have largely recognized the need for a comprehensive strategy , comprising targeted policies and deep structural reforms , to develop new sources of growth . 
It has become apparent , however , that emerging-market enthusiasts underestimated at least two critical factors . 
First , emerging economies &quot; motivation to transform their growth models was weaker than expected . 
The global economic environment - characterized by massive amounts of liquidity and low interest rates stemming from unconventional monetary policy in advanced economies - led most emerging economies to use their policy space to build up existing drivers of growth , rather than develop new ones . 
But the growth returns have dwindled , while imbalances have worsened . 
Countries like Russia , India , Brazil , South Africa , and Turkey used the space available for credit expansion to support consumption , without a corresponding increase in investment . 
China &apos;s non-financial corporate debt increased dramatically , partly owing to dubious real-estate investments . 
Moreover , nothing was done in anticipation of the end of terms-of-trade gains in resource-rich countries like Russia , Brazil , Indonesia , and South Africa , which have been facing rising wage costs and supply-capacity limits . 
And fiscal weakness and balance-of-payments fragility have become more acute in India , Indonesia , South Africa , and Turkey . 
The second problem with emerging-economy forecasts was their failure to account for the vigor with which vested interests and other political forces would resist reform - a major oversight , given how uneven these countries &quot; reform efforts had been prior to 2008 . 
The inevitable time lag between reforms and results has not helped matters . 
Nonetheless , while emerging economies &quot; prospects were clearly over-hyped in the wake of the crisis , the bleak forecasts that dominate today &apos;s headlines are similarly exaggerated . 
There are still a number of factors indicating that emerging economies &quot; role in the global economy will continue to grow - just not as rapidly or dramatically as previously thought . 
This summer , the mere suggestion of a monetary-policy reversal in the United States sparked a surge in bond yields , which triggered an asset sell-off in several major emerging economies . 
Perhaps that experience will serve as a wake-up call for these countries &quot; leaders . 
Only by recognizing the weaknesses of old growth patterns and pursuing the needed structural reforms can emerging economies achieve strong , stable , and sustainable GDP growth - and fulfill their potential as the global economy &apos;s main engines .
