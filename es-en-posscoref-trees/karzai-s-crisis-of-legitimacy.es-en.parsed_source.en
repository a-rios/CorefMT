Karzai \ u0027s Crisis of Legitimacy 
Reading the press of late , you might conclude that all Harmid Karzai , Afghanistan &apos;s chief , needs to pacify his country is an expanded international peacekeeping presence and faster delivery of aid . 
The carrot of international assistance and the stick of peacekeeping forces will allegedly prevent Karzai &apos;s government from dying in the cradle . 
Swayed by this logic , the US has pushed to accelerate delivery of aid - a task it knows well how to achieve , having provided nine-tenths of all emergency relief money to Afghanistan even during the Taliban years . 
President Bush &apos;s announcement that the US , Japan , and Saudi Arabia have created a $ 180 million fund to reconstruct Afghanistan &apos;s trunk highways is the most recent measure to speed up the flow of development assistance . 
The international security force , staffed mainly by Turks , is being upgraded and its mandate extended to the entire country . 
When Paul Wolfowitz , the US Deputy Secretary of Defense , announced this , it represented a reversal of America &apos;s earlier position , which favored confining the peacekeeping forces to Kabul lest they get in the way of US operations against Al Qaeda and Taliban diehards . 
The trouble with this carrot-and-stick strategy is not that it is wrong but that it is insufficient . 
It fails to recognize that neither expanded peacekeeping nor efficiently delivered aid will achieve their desired ends until the Afghan public accepts the Karzai government as fairly representing its interests . 
Today it does not . 
The American Revolution can be traced directly to the growing sense among colonists that Parliament &apos;s rule in North America was illegitimate . 
The speed with which debates in the French Estates General evolved into a revolt against the Bourbons reflected the deepening sense among ordinary Frenchmen that Louis XVI &apos;s rule lacked legitimacy . 
Neither the best-armed government nor the richest can long survive unless broad sections of their population accept its rule as legitimate . 
Britain failed in America and the French crown failed in France because the governed ceased to recognize their authority . 
Legitimacy shifted from the regime to its opponents , who soon brought it down . 
Something like this is now occurring in Afghanistan . 
If the causes of this development are not addressed , Karzai &apos;s government will inevitably collapse , and with it the entire international process that began a year ago . 
Why do Afghans perceive as illegitimate a government put in place by an agreement to which all factions assented , a government that was confirmed by a duly constituted National Assembly ( Loya Jirga ) held under international patronage ? 
The reason is that Karzai &apos;s government , and Karzai himself , are controlled by a small group of powerful men associated with the former Northern Alliance and dominated by Minister of Defense Marshall Fahim . 
Foreign commentators often acknowledge that a clique of Tajiks exerts inordinate influence in the government . 
This understates the government &apos;s exclusiveness . 
Many key figures are from a handful of villages in just one valley , the Panjshir . 
Pashtuns living in the strategically important south and east , together with Shi &apos;a Muslim Hezaras , constitute some two-thirds of Afghanistan &apos;s population . 
Neither group feels adequately represented in Karzai &apos;s councils . 
Many Uzbeks , Turkmens , and even some Tajiks , feel excluded . 
Every politically active person in the country understands the reality of this power grab . 
They know that Fahim used the Loya Jirga to promote Karzai , a Pashtun , because he was malleable and without independent forces of his own . 
They tremble at the fact that Marshall Fahim &apos;s army , the country &apos;s largest , sits in garrisons ringing Kabul . 
They are frustrated at the international community &apos;s blindness to their fate . 
This frustration , and Fahim &apos;s efforts to suppress it , lies at the heart of many of the recent bloody events now blamed on Taliban die-hards , uncooperative local warlords , and Al Qaeda . 
Many dissenting Pashtuns did back the Taliban , mostly because it promised to bring peace and order . 
Many warlords are indeed carrying on their struggle , often with foreign ( and even American ) backing . 
Al Qaeda , too , has an interest in crippling Karzai &apos;s government and is happy to exploit its Achilles heel . 
The only way to resist these threats is to address their root cause : the imbalance of power at the top of the regime and within ministry staffs that is gradually robbing Karzai &apos;s government of legitimacy . 
The fact that Karzai is decent and well intentioned does not alleviate his problem , which he is incapable of addressing alone . 
The solution must be to use firmness backed , if necessary , by military strength , to enable Karzai to face down Marshall Fahim . 
Now that the international peacekeeping force is to operate nationally , Marshall Fahim must be told to lift his stranglehold on Kabul . 
Now that aid is beginning to flow , Karzai must be told that its continuation is contingent on his bringing prominent Pashtuns and Hezaras into the inner circles of government . 
The US and UN are both acting on the basis of a na√Øve hope that Karzai &apos;s legitimacy problem can somehow be &quot; finessed . &quot; 
They are misjudging the seriousness of the situation . 
If action is not taken soon , Karzai will not survive . 
The next government would likely be anti-UN , anti-western , anti-American , and anti-secular - and form its political and strategic alliances accordingly . 
Of course , a new government may not emerge at all . 
Either way , unless decisive measures are taken within weeks or at most months , Afghanistan will be on its way to yet another round of bloody conflict .
