Russia for Racists 
MOSCOW - In Russia , if you have dark hair and a slightly swarthy complexion , you are likely to be in danger . 
Sadly , Russia &apos;s leaders have tolerated , if not encouraged , fear of foreigners and assaults on those whose appearance differs from the average Russian . 
In a residential area of Moscow , a group of adolescents , many with shaven heads and wearing combat boots , marches and shouts Russian nationalist slogans . 
When they come across three Azerbaijani boys , they don &apos;t hesitate . 
Soon , one of the boys - only 13 years old - lies severely injured ; he will have to be hospitalized . 
The other two are injured as well . 
The perpetrators are never caught . 
Bashir Osiev , 24 , an Ingushetian-born clerk in a Moscow bank , is assaulted by a group of skinheads while walking home with a friend . 
The friend is badly wounded but manages to escape ; 
Osiev dies after being stabbed in the back . 
Two of the assailants are injured in the course of the fight and arrested after seeking medical assistance at a hospital . 
The others are never caught . 
Two men from the Caucasus are on their way to the metro , and are attacked by a group of adolescents with knives . 
Both are treated in hospital , the perpetrators escape unrecognized . 
In a small town in central Russia , two Uzbeks are viciously beaten up by a group of teenagers . 
All of these incidents occurred within just one week . 
They are picked at random from an endless series of similar assaults , many of which end fatally . 
Russian authorities tend to play down these attacks as the acts of rowdies - even when the perpetrators are caught and can be prosecuted . 
This is because charging someone with racism and xenophobia is more complicated and the process more drawn out than winning a conviction for simple thuggery . 
Indeed , Russia &apos;s racists can be assured of considerable sympathy from the security forces and the public . 
After all , these attacks generally don &apos;t occur in some dark alleyway . 
In most instances , they take place in crowded markets , metro stations , or simply in busy streets . Passersby look the other way - even if the victims are women and children . 
A Chechen friend of mine and her 14-year-old son were attacked in the street by three drunken skinheads . 
The skinheads began to push them around and harass them , as people in the street looked away and kept moving . 
My friend managed to talk insistently to the three until eventually they left her and her son alone , only to pounce on a married couple that happened to be passing by . 
The man looked like a Jew , they insisted loudly , and started to push him around . 
But he &apos;s Russian , his frightened wife insisted , whereupon the three - apparently mellowed by drink - apologized and let him go . 
Neither husband nor wife were alarmed that the three drunks were chasing Caucasians and Jews , but pressed charges because they , as Russian citizens , had been harassed . 
My friend didn &apos;t . 
It would not do any good , she said resignedly , and then spoke of how her 12-year-old daughter is repeatedly told at school that all Chechens are criminals and that nobody likes them . 
Since the day Vladimir Putin spoke on TV of flushing all Chechen terrorists down the toilet , hatred of Caucasians has become all but socially acceptable . 
Once again , a subgroup of the population has been declared bandits and potential terrorists , satisfying people &apos;s urge to find a clearly identifiable enemy who can be blamed for all that is wrong in today &apos;s Russia . 
While there has been no lack of speeches calling for tolerance and condemning racist and anti-Semitic attacks , the situation barely changes . 
The old USSR was anything but tolerant . 
Once &quot; we were somebody &quot; ; today &quot; nobody takes us seriously , so we have to defend ourselves against anything that comes from outside and holds us down . &quot; 
Both the state and openly racist , xenophobic and anti-Semitic groups - of which there are dozens , as well as more than 100 clearly xenophobic publications - increasingly ignore Russia &apos;s multi-ethnic character . 
In an everyday context , this is reflected in slogans like &quot; Russia for Russians , &quot; which really means white European Russians . 
The attacks therefore are directed in equal measure against people from the Asian former Soviet republics , Africa , and the Far East , as well as Russian citizens from the Caucasus or who belong to one of Russia &apos;s more than 90 national minorities . 
The state hypocritically expresses its concern while doing nothing to oppose it , because too many officials are only too willing to exploit such sentiments .
