When Women Lead 
MUNICH - Would the world be more peaceful if women were in charge ? 
A challenging new book by the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker says that the answer is &quot; yes . &quot; 
In The Better Angels of Our Nature , Pinker presents data showing that human violence , while still very much with us today , has been gradually declining . 
Moreover , he says , &quot; over the long sweep of history , women have been and will be a pacifying force . 
Traditional war is a man &apos;s game : tribal women never band together to raid neighboring villages . &quot; 
As mothers , women have evolutionary incentives to maintain peaceful conditions in which to nurture their offspring and ensure that their genes survive into the next generation . 
Skeptics immediately reply that women have not made war simply because they have rarely been in power . 
If they were empowered as leaders , the conditions of an anarchic world would force them to make the same bellicose decisions that men do . 
Margaret Thatcher , Golda Meir , and Indira Gandhi were powerful women ; all of them led their countries to war . 
But it is also true that these women rose to leadership by playing according to the political rules of &quot; a man &apos;s world . &quot; 
It was their success in conforming to male values that enabled their rise to leadership in the first place . 
In a world in which women held a proportionate share ( one-half ) of leadership positions , they might behave differently in power . 
So we are left with the broader question : does gender really matter in leadership ? 
In terms of stereotypes , various psychological studies show that men gravitate to the hard power of command , while women are collaborative and intuitively understand the soft power of attraction and persuasion . 
Americans tend to describe leadership with tough male stereotypes , but recent leadership studies show increased success for what was once considered a &quot; feminine style . &quot; 
In information-based societies , networks are replacing hierarchies , and knowledge workers are less deferential . 
Management in a wide range of organizations is changing in the direction of &quot; shared leadership , &quot; and &quot; distributed leadership , &quot; with leaders in the center of a circle rather than atop a pyramid . 
Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said that he had to &quot; coddle &quot; his employees . 
Even the military faces these changes . 
In the United States , the Pentagon says that Army drillmasters do &quot; less shouting at everyone , &quot; because today &apos;s generation responds better to instructors who play &quot; a more counseling-type role . &quot; 
Military success against terrorists and counterinsurgents requires soldiers to win hearts and minds , not just break buildings and bodies . 
Former US President George W. Bush once described his role as &quot; the decider , &quot; but there is much more to modern leadership than that . 
Modern leaders must be able to use networks , to collaborate , and to encourage participation . 
Women &apos;s non-hierarchical style and relational skills fit a leadership need in the new world of knowledge-based organizations and groups that men , on average , are less well prepared to meet . 
In the past , when women fought their way to the top of organizations , they often had to adopt a &quot; masculine style , &quot; violating the broader social norm of female &quot; niceness . &quot; 
Now , however , with the information revolution and democratization demanding more participatory leadership , the &quot; feminine style &quot; is becoming a path to more effective leadership . 
In order to lead successfully , men will not only have to value this style in their women colleagues , but will also have to master the same skills . 
That is a trend , not ( yet ) a fact . 
Women still lag in leadership positions , holding only 5 % of top corporate positions and a minority of positions in elected legislatures ( just 16 % in the US , for example , compared to 45 % in Sweden ) . 
One study of the 1,941 rulers of independent countries during the twentieth century found only 27 women , roughly half of whom came to power as widows or daughters of a male ruler . 
Less than 1 % of twentieth-century rulers were women who gained power on their own . 
So , given the new conventional wisdom in leadership studies that entering the information age means entering a woman &apos;s world , why are women not doing better ? 
Lack of experience , primary caregiver responsibilities , bargaining style , and plain old discrimination all help to explain the gender gap . 
Traditional career paths , and the cultural norms that constructed and reinforced them , simply have not enabled women to gain the skills required for top leadership positions in many organizational contexts . 
Research shows that even in democratic societies , women face a higher social risk than men when attempting to negotiate for career-related resources such as compensation . 
Women are generally not well integrated into male networks that dominate organizations , and gender stereotypes still hamper women who try to overcome such barriers . 
This bias is beginning to break down in information-based societies , but it is a mistake to identify the new type of leadership we need in an information age simply as &quot; a woman &apos;s world . &quot; 
Even positive stereotypes are bad for women , men , and effective leadership . 
Leaders should be viewed less in terms of heroic command than as encouraging participation throughout an organization , group , country , or network . 
Questions of appropriate style - when to use hard and soft skills - are equally relevant for men and women , and should not be clouded by traditional gender stereotypes . 
In some circumstances , men will need to act more &quot; like women &quot; ; in others , women will need to be more &quot; like men . &quot; 
The key choices about war and peace in our future will depend not on gender , but on how leaders combine hard- and soft-power skills to produce smart strategies . 
Both men and women will make those decisions .
