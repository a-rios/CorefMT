Seeming Green 
COPENHAGEN - When Denmark &apos;s new government ministers presented themselves to Queen Margrethe II last month , the incoming development minister established his green credentials by rolling up to the palace in a tiny , three-wheeled , electric-powered vehicle . 
The photo opportunity made a powerful statement about the minister &apos;s commitment to the environment - but probably not the one he intended . 
Christian Friis Bach &apos;s electric-powered vehicle was incapable of covering the 30 kilometers from his house to the palace without running out of power . 
So he put the electric mini-car inside a horse trailer and dragged it behind his petrol-powered CitroÃ«n for three-quarters of the trip , switching back to the mini-car when he neared the television cameras . 
The stunt produced more carbon emissions than if he had ditched the electric car and horse trailer and driven a regular car the entire distance . 
Unfortunately , the story is not unique . 
Under the United Kingdom &apos;s Labour government in 2006 , Conservative party leader David Cameron attracted attention for trying to &quot; green &quot; his credentials by cycling to work ; the tactic went awry when it emerged that a car trailed him carrying his briefcase . 
But environmental hypocrisy in current politics runs deeper than photo opportunities . 
In Denmark , as across the developed world , politicians are promising to fix the globe &apos;s financial mess by overseeing a transition to a greener economy . 
In the United States , President Barack Obama touts &quot; green jobs . &quot; 
Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has introduced a carbon tax to &quot; enable economic growth without increases in carbon pollution . &quot; 
And David Cameron was elected Prime Minister on a promise to lead the UK &apos;s &quot; greenest government ever . &quot; 
Denmark serves as a useful test of whether these leaders &quot; preferred policies yield the environmental and economic benefits that they promise . 
In tune with international enthusiasm for green energy investment , the Danish government intends to expand wind power dramatically by 2020 . 
That is a significant gesture , but , since the country is part of the European Union &apos;s emissions-trading scheme , it will mean absolutely nothing for global CO2 emissions . 
It will simply make coal power cheaper in other EU countries . 
Indeed , costly emission cuts in Denmark and elsewhere are likely to lead to a partial relocation of CO2 emissions to more lenient countries , such as China ( where production is less climate-efficient ) , and thus to an overall increase in global CO2 emissions . 
The EU has reduced its emissions since 1990 , but , at the same time , it has increased imports from China , which alone has produced enough emissions to offset those reductions . 
Some will argue that we must implement a comprehensive Kyoto-style agreement to cut emissions globally . 
But , as we saw at the farcical Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 , such an agreement is impossible . 
Nobody expects a deal to emerge from next month &apos;s summit in Durban , South Africa , and with good reason : even with Democrats in the White House and controlling Congress , the US could not implement an agreement on climate change , while emerging economies , led by China and India , are unwilling to implement measures that would impede growth . 
Danish politicians - like politicians elsewhere - claim that a green economy will cost nothing , or may even be a source of new growth . 
Unfortunately , this is not true . 
Globally , there is a clear correlation between higher growth rates and higher CO2 emissions . 
Furthermore , nearly every green energy source is still more expensive than fossil fuels , even when calculating pollution costs . 
We do not burn fossil fuels simply to annoy environmentalists . 
Politicians in Denmark and elsewhere argue as if this were no longer true : a transition to a green economy will create millions of new &quot; green jobs . &quot; 
But , while green-energy subsidies generate more jobs in green-energy sectors , they also displace similar numbers of jobs elsewhere . 
This is not surprising : either customers or taxpayers must finance subsidies . 
Electricity prices will increase , implying a drag on private-sector job creation . 
If the goal is to create jobs , public investment in other areas - such as the health care - generates stronger , faster employment growth . 
To bring the point home , for years Danish politicians have insisted on subsidizing the world &apos;s largest , Danish-based , wind-turbine producer , Vestas , arguing that Denmark wins when other countries spend subsidies on Danish wind-farm technology . 
But when the Danish Economic Council examined the situation in 2004 , it concluded that the country had lost money overall from expenditures on subsidies . 
More seriously , in today &apos;s tough financial times , the solar and wind industries are downsizing production in expensive countries and shifting employment to cheaper economies . 
Last year , Vestas dismissed 3,000 employees in Denmark and Sweden . 
Many politicians are drawn to photo opportunities and lofty rhetoric about &quot; building a green economy . &quot; 
Unfortunately , the green-energy policies currently being pursued are not helping the environment or the economy . 
More likely , they will lead to greater emissions in China , more outsourcing to India , and lower growth rates for the well-intentioned &quot; green &quot; countries .
