The Drug War \ u0027s Failures 
If we &apos;re lucky , our grandchildren will recall the global war on drugs of the late 20th and early 21st century as some bizarre mania to which only past generations could succumb . 
The world &apos;s drug problems are far more severe today than they were a century ago . 
Not that drug use has increased fantastically - after all , huge quantities of alcohol , opium and other drugs were consumed back then . 
The real problem is that today &apos;s drug control policies foster more harm than good ; indeed , they probably cause more overall harm than drug abuse itself . 
Like alcohol Prohibition in the US during the 1920s and early 1930s , global drug prohibition has failed to reduce drug abuse even as it generates extraordinary levels of crime , violence , corruption and disease . 
In 1998 , the UN estimated the total value of the illicit drug trade at $ 400 billion , or 7 % of global trade . 
Critics say the figure is only half that - still a remarkable sum . 
Colombia today is far worse than Chicago under Al Capone . 
So , too , are other Latin American , Caribbean and Asian countries . 
Drug prohibition effectively imposes a tax on the global trade in illicit drugs that is enforced by governments and collected by those willing to violate the laws . 
No other set of laws produces so much revenue for criminals , terrorists and corrupt officials . No other laws generate so much corruption or such violence ; and no other set of laws contributes so much to the spread of HIV / AIDS , hepatitis and other diseases . 
The war on drugs persists in part because of two myths . 
The first assumes that human beings are better off &quot; drug free , &quot; and that all societies should strive to be drug free . 
But few - if any - drug free societies ever existed . 
The second myth presumes that prohibition reduces the harm associated with drugs . 
Global markets in cannabis , opium and coca products are basically similar to other global commodities markets , yet global drug control policies operate on the assumption that the drug markets bear more in common with smallpox and other infectious diseases for which there is no demand . 
Governments can act unilaterally and multilaterally to regulate commodity markets , but it is a mistake to perceive prohibition as the ultimate or maximum form of regulation . 
Prohibition in fact represents the abdication of regulation . 
Whatever is not suppressed is effectively unregulated , except by criminal organizations . 
Around the world , drug law violations account for the largest share of the roughly 8 million people incarcerated in local jails and prisons . 
In 1980 , 50,000 people were incarcerated in the US for drug law violations . 
Today , the total approaches half-a-million , with a few hundred thousand more locked up on other prohibition-related offenses . 
That total represents almost 10 % of all the world &apos;s inmates . 
Throughout the developing world , poor peasants involved in producing opium , coca and cannabis are arrested , sometimes beaten , and often extorted by government agents enforcing drug laws . 
In Bolivia and Peru , coca was integrated into society . 
The same was true of opium in Asia . 
Prohibitions imposed by the US and other governments decimated traditions that often &quot; domesticated &quot; these drugs so as to reduce their harm , while simultaneously encouraging transitions to refined drugs like heroin and cocaine . 
US law enforcement and intelligence agencies routinely provide information to other governments knowing that it will be used not just to arrest but to torture those they identify . 
All these consequences of the drug war can be defined as human rights abuses . 
But the core human rights issue is different - the notion that people should not be punished for what they put into their bodies . 
That right of sovereignty over one &apos;s mind and body - which also incorporates the right not to be forced to take drugs against one &apos;s will - represents in some respects the most fundamental of all rights . 
Heroin users are denied the most effective medication available to remedy their addiction , i.e. , methadone . 
People unable or unwilling to stop injecting drugs are denied access to sterile syringes , with devastating consequences . 
Millions who smoke marijuana or consume other psychoactive drugs are harmed far more by state action than by drug use . 
More and more voices are calling for a systematic review and revision of the international anti-drug conventions that sustain today &apos;s failed policies . 
Some emphasize the anti-scientific and otherwise illegitimate basis for including cannabis and coca in the conventions . 
Others point to the contradictions between anti-drug conventions and international human rights conventions . 
Others note that the anti-drug conventions exacerbate the problems they seek to ameliorate . 
A new global drug control regime is needed . 
It must reject the foolish rhetoric of creating &quot; a drug-free world &quot; and acknowledge that the true challenge is learning to live with drugs so that they cause the least harm . 
An effective strategy needs to establish realistic objectives and criteria for evaluating success or failure , and these criteria must focus on reducing the death , disease , crime and suffering associated with both drug use and drug policies . 
It also must embrace the principle that people should not be punished for what they put into their bodies , but only for the harms they do others . 
Those are the key elements of a more ethical and effective drug control regime than the one that haunts today &apos;s world .
