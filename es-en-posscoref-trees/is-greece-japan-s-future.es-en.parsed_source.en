Is Greece Japan &apos;s Future ? 
TOKYO - The Greek fiscal crisis has sent shockwaves through markets around the world . 
In just two years , Greece &apos;s budget deficit jumped from 4 % of GDP to 13 % . 
Now other European Union countries seem under threat , and the EU and the International Monetary Fund are grappling to stem the crisis before another nation trembles . 
But the problem of excessive government debt is not confined to the EU . 
Indeed , Japan &apos;s debt-to-GDP ratio is around 170 % - much higher than in Greece , where the figure stands at around 110 % . 
But , despite the grim parallel , Japan &apos;s government does not seem to think that it needs to take the problem seriously . 
Last year &apos;s general election brought regime change to Japan . 
Yukio Hatoyama &apos;s Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) thrashed the Liberal Democratic Party , which had governed almost continuously for a half-century . 
But Hatoyama &apos;s government has ignored macroeconomic management by abolishing the policy board charged with discussing economic and fiscal policy . 
Instead , the government has focused on increasing spending to meet its grand electoral promises , including a huge amount for new grants to households and farmers . 
As a result , the ratio of tax revenue to total spending this fiscal year has fallen below 50 % for the first time in Japan &apos;s postwar history . 
If the government continues on this path , many expect next year &apos;s budget deficit to widen further . 
Despite the weakness of Japan &apos;s fiscal position , the market for Japanese Government Bonds ( JGBs ) remains stable , at least for now . 
Japan had a similar experience in the 1990 &quot; s , the country &apos;s so-called &quot; lost decade . &quot; 
At that time , Japan &apos;s budget deficit soared after the country &apos;s property bubble burst , causing economic stagnation . 
But JGBs are mostly purchased by domestic organizations and households . 
In other words , the private sector &apos;s huge savings financed the government &apos;s deficit , so that capital flight never occurred in the way it has in Greece , despite the desperate budget situation . 
But this situation has deteriorated recently , for two reasons . 
First , the total volume of JGBs has become extremely high relative to households &quot; net monetary assets , which stand at roughly ¥ 1,100 trillion . 
But in a mere three years , total JGBs will exceed this total . 
This suggests that taxpayer assets will no longer back government debt , at which point confidence in the JGB market is likely to shatter . 
Second , Japanese society is aging - fast . 
As a result , the country &apos;s household savings rate will decrease dramatically , making it increasingly difficult for the private sector to finance budget deficits . 
Moreover , an aging population implies further pressure on fiscal expenditure , owing to higher pension and health-care costs , with all of Japan &apos;s baby boomers set to reach age 65 in about five years . 
The increase in social-welfare costs is expected to start around 2013 , three years from now . 
Given these factors , the JGB market , which has been stable so far , will face serious trouble in the years ahead . 
After averting its eyes since coming to power , Japan &apos;s new government has finally started discussing tax hikes . 
One possibility is an increase in the consumption tax , which currently stands at 5 % - low in comparison with other industrialized countries . 
But tax hikes alone with not close Japan &apos;s fiscal black hole . 
What is most needed is consistent and stable macroeconomic management . 
Such management is possible . 
Between 2001and 2006 , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi aggressively tackled Japan &apos;s fiscal problems . 
Koizumi sought smaller government and set clear numerical targets for fiscal consolidation , including a primary budget balance in 10 years . 
Surprisingly , Koizumi was almost successful . 
Japan &apos;s primary deficit of ¥ 28 trillion in 2002 was reduced to only ¥ 6 trillion by 2007 . 
If this effort had been continued for two more years , a primary budget surplus could have been realized . 
But over the past three years , the prime minister changed each year , and a populist trend in fiscal expenditure took hold . 
What is needed most now is for the DPJ government to restore comprehensive economic management . 
A tax hike is only part of that . 
Without a strategy for growth , an effort to reduce government spending , and a policy to stop deflation , a tax hike will not solve the problem . 
Indeed , some economists fear that a fiscal crisis could erupt even aftera tax hike is passed . 
Once that happens , the impact on neighboring countries - and on the world economy - will be huge compared to the current European problem . 
After all , Japan remains the world &apos;s second largest economy , accounting for about one-third of Asia &apos;s GDP , and 8 % of global output , whereas the GDP share of Greece in the EU is about 3 % . 
In some countries , lower military expenditures and interest rates has helped to improve a weak fiscal position . 
But in the case of Japan , military spending is already low , as are interest rates . 
This suggests that fiscal rescue will be extremely difficult if and when trouble starts - and underscores the urgent need for real political leadership now .
