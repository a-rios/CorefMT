Putin \ u0027s Puppies and Russian Democracy 
When overseeing military exercises from aboard a nuclear submarine near Scandinavia , Vladimir Putin announced that Russia had developed a new missile system , the finest in the world . 
It was not his most convincing moment . 
Three older missiles , launched in his presence , failed to reach their targets on Kamchatka . 
The submarine that Putin was on resembled the Kursk , which exploded during a similar military exercise in 2000 , killing 118 sailors . 
After the Kursk catastrophe , Putin was asked what really happened . 
&quot; It sank , &quot; he replied , with a somewhat macabre smile . 
In a recent joke , an interviewer asks Putin what happened to his favorite dog &apos;s puppies , whose birth he proudly announced during last December &apos;s parliamentary elections . 
&quot; They sank , &quot; he answers . 
Russian democracy is almost as young and blind as Putin &apos;s puppies - but much poorer . 
Low-income countries can develop democracy , but they have a tough time maintaining it . 
India , which is both poor and democratic , is a happy exception to this rule . 
Will Russia , whose political legacy is not British but Soviet , be another ? 
Countries with per capita incomes close to the current Russian level sustain democracy for 15-20 years on average . 
Russian democracy , born in 1991 , may be nearing its expiration date . 
Putin &apos;s first term in office proved to be an economic success and a political failure . 
High oil prices kept Russia &apos;s economy - and common people &apos;s income Â­ - growing rapidly . 
( Europeans need not be envious : growth is quicker when it begins low ; think again about puppies . ) 
Russia is a rich country with a poor population , and redistribution schemes work well in such conditions . 
But they will not work for long . 
Putin promises to double Russia &apos;s GDP by 2010 - an ambitious aim , and success would improve democracy &apos;s prospects . 
But few of Putin &apos;s promises have been fulfilled . 
The Chechen war drags on , bringing new victims every month . 
Foreign students are killed because of growing racism . 
The population is declining , but immigration is blocked for ideological reasons . 
Military reform has yet to begin . 
Independent media are practically extinct . 
Russia &apos;s international position is worse than ever . 
Turkey and Ukraine aspire to join the European Union ; 
Russia does not . 
Putin counts on economic growth as the basis for his personal popularity . 
Private companies , not the state , generate Russian growth . 
Practically everything that a Russian citizen can find in a supermarket , including the supermarket itself , is produced or imported by private firms . 
Oil , the main engine of growth , is privately controlled . 
In the late 1980 &apos;s , Mikhail Gorbachev announced that Russian oil was practically exhausted . 
Now Putin claims credit for making Russia the world &apos;s leading producer , ahead of Saudi Arabia . 
This is indeed a success . 
The hydrocarbons sector secures Russian growth , undermines the power of Arab producers and OPEC , and thus promises a decrease in oil prices . 
The problem for Putin is that this success was achieved not by the Russian state , but by private enterprises . 
By creating independent courts , securing property rights , and collecting fair taxes , the state is crucial for making the environment favorable for business . 
But to attribute the performance of Russian business to the efforts of the state is the same as attributing a writer &apos;s work to his editor , or even to his censor . 
Many Russian industrialists , such as the founders of Yukos Oil , oversaw their businesses &apos; stunning growth . 
Now some of them are in jail , in exile , or frightened out of the industry . 
In the meantime , economic growth , which is vital for an impoverished but ambitious population , was the central issue of the presidential campaign . 
You cannot deceive people about growth ; they feel the weight of their pockets better than anyone else . 
But you can manipulate their understanding of it : who are the authors of growth , the Khodorkovskys or the Putins ? 
Growth , it seems , is attributed here not to those who produce it , but to those who punish it . 
The business of Putin and his coterie is politics . 
Trained as lawyers or even as philologists , but with their formative experience in the security services , these people introduced a concept they call &quot; political technology . &quot; 
These &quot; technologies &quot; range from producing decoy political parties and legally persecuting opponents to publishing fake polls and falsifying elections . 
Of course , electorates have been cheated , bribed , and blackmailed for as long as there have been elections . 
What is fairly new , at least for Russians , is that these &quot; technologies &quot; are efficiently coordinated from the top of the presidential administration . 
The most successful recent example was the invention of the political party &quot; Motherland , &quot; which took protest votes away from the liberal parties as well as from the Communists . 
Created by the presidential administration two months before the December parliamentary elections , &quot; Motherland &quot; split and practically collapsed two months after its amazing victory . 
Russian political experts , pollsters , and consultants ascribe every success or failure in Russian politics to &quot; political technologies . &quot; 
Their profession has become so important in recent years that there is now a special &quot; Day of the Political Consultant &quot; in Russia every February 25 . 
This year &apos;s day saw Putin sack the then Prime Minister , Mikhail Kasyanov - an architect of Russia &apos;s pro-business reforms - as if to celebrate the overriding power of &quot; political technology . &quot; 
This manner of governance bodes well neither for economic growth nor democracy in the long term . 
For when you drown puppies , they sink .
