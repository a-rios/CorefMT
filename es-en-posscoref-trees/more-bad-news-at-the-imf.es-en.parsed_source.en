More Bad News at the IMF 
CAMBRIDGE : Bad news is all the IMF has been getting in the last year . 
First came a divisive fight over naming a new Managing Director : Germany pushed a little known and unqualified bureaucrat and failed to have him accepted . 
In the end , Chancellor Schroder was given a fig leaf to hide his embarrassment in the form of the present managing director , Horst Kohler , whose main qualification for the job is being German , unlike his two predecessors De Larosiere and Camdessus , who were distinguished French inspecteusr de finances , i.e. they belonged to the cream of cream in the bureaucratic elite of France . 
The next slap came from criticism by American Republicans of the IMF &apos;s strategy as nothing but unending bailouts . 
That criticism was enshrined in the Meltzer Report , which now hangs even more ominously over the IMF because the Republicans now rule in Washington . 
America &apos;s Congress has never had much sympathy for the IMF . 
Democrats question tough-minded programs ; 
But criticism of the IMF not only comes from the American right . 
A few shots across the bow came from inside the community , from just across the street at the World Bank . 
The most notable barrage here was the affaire Stiglitz , when the World Bank &apos;s chief economist accused the IMF of malpractice , gaining applause from bad economists and failed policy makers worldwide . 
The latest hits have just happened . 
First came the resignation of IMF chief economist Michael Mussa , a formidable University of Chicago-educated economist renowned for good judgment . 
He predicted most of the crises that came along but that did not raise his popularity with the IMF &apos;s board . 
Mussa was also remarkable for a flamboyant presentation of his views , which was hard for some IMF folk to tolerate in so stuffy environment . 
The final hit is comes in the form of the resignation of the IMF &apos;s first deputy managing director , Stanley Fischer , who was in charge of assuring continuity and good sense as well as staff morale . 
These two departures come on top of a steady exodus of talent to Wall Street in recent years . 
So the IMF is at a cross roads , it is weak in leadership , weak on economics knowledge at its top , weak in the support it gets from its member countries . 
The IMF has become a household word , but one with unfavorable connotations . 
Ask any undergraduate about the IMF and the answer , however vague , is invariably negative . 
Ask any leftist activist , and the IMF competes with greedy multinationals as the lowest form of life . 
Part of this negative assessment is inevitable : by the time a country comes to the IMF it is on its way to the economic emergency room . 
Radical surgery usually follows . 
The fact that recovery does come is noted less than the time spent in hospital . 
IMF policies are criticized more than the awful policies that incited a country to collapse in the first place . 
Turkey today is a case in point , or Russia , or Asia in 1997-98 . 
What can the IMF do ? 
Little by itself , of course , because it is governed by its member countries and that means the US , Europe ( which does not speak with one voice ) , and Japan ( which has no voice ) . 
The most important issue now is the Fischer succession . 
The right person should not necessarily be an American as that would unduly limit the choice and risks bringing an appointment more distinguished by ideology than competence . 
Doling out top international jobs by nationality is a terrible practice and choosing Fischer &apos;s replacement presents a wonderful opportunity to make a break with this routine . 
The successful appointee should be , above all , an effective administrator and a top economist experienced in policymaking . 
But the IMF must also reinvent itself to become far more focused ; it may not be able to change its image but it can become more effective . 
There are two ways to do this : 
- resist the temptation of mission creep : the IMF is widening its focus to poverty issues , corruption issues , environment issues , governance issues . 
All these are important , all these are remotely affected by IMF policies , none of them can get around the central truth that a country which has hit the ropes needs to practice austerity . 
The IMF is well advised to stay away from the details and not stretch its little political capital to so broad a range of issues with an inevitable failure in satisfying the whole range of partners in an ever-wider dialogue ; 
- increase transparency . 
The IMF staff must begin to report , publicly and for everyone to see , the shortcomings in countries &apos; balance sheets and currency strategies because these are invariably the causes of collapse . 
Over and over again , Turkey being the latest example , the IMF is mute for too long . 
The IMF board must learn that muzzling the IMF staff contributes to crisis by postponing a reckoning . 
The IMF is an important part of the international financial architecture , but it is in great need of repair . 
It needs a strong and respected leadership in the top ranks and it needs a refocusing of its mission and a shift from emergency operations to preventive medicine . 
Because the IMF is at a crossroads , now is the time for serious reforms , not a quick fix .
