Can Central Banks Still Influence Exchange Rates ? 
LONDON - On September 16 , 1992 , a date that lives in infamy in the United Kingdom as &quot; Black Wednesday , &quot; the Bank of England abandoned its efforts to keep the British pound within its permitted band in the European exchange-rate mechanism . 
Supporting sterling at the required exchange rate had proved prohibitively expensive for the Bank and the British government . 
By contrast , it proved highly remunerative for George Soros . 
Since then , the Bank of England has eschewed all forms of intervention in the foreign-exchange markets . 
And the episode served to reinforce an international consensus that countries &quot; monetary policy should focus on domestic price stability while letting exchange rates float freely . 
After Black Wednesday , it became conventional wisdom that it was simply impossible to fix both the exchange rate and domestic monetary conditions at the same time . 
According to this view , in a market economy with a convertible currency and free capital flows , the exchange rate cannot be manipulated without consequent adjustments to other dimensions of monetary conditions . 
Seeking to influence exchange rates using capital controls or direct intervention in currency markets was doomed to failure in anything other than the shortest term . 
This consensus has been maintained through a long period in which exchange rates between the major Western currencies have been allowed to find their own level . 
But it did not extend to Asia . 
The Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 convinced governments and central banks that countries that maintained exchange controls were able to weather the storm better than countries that embraced liberalization . 
It was accepted that maintaining exchange controls required a high level of foreign reserves . 
So , in much of Asia , we have seen fixed exchange rates for the last decade or more , the maintenance of some exchange controls on capital flows , and a massive increase in foreign-exchange reserves . 
The authorities have tolerated somewhat greater volatility in domestic inflation rates as a consequence . 
There are now signs that the consensus reigning in Western central banks for the last two decades is being challenged . 
Some economists have begun to argue that central banks need not be so wary of intervening . 
For example , Paul De Grauwe of the University of Leuvem has proposed that the European Central Bank should intervene when exchange-rate developments are out of touch with economic reality , in order to send a signal to the markets . 
He points to the high volatility of the dollar / euro rate over the last decade , and its adverse consequences for economic activity in Europe . 
Politicians , too , are concerned . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has regularly complained about the damaging consequences of excess currency volatility , and has called for exchange rates and international monetary conditions to be at the top of the G-20 agenda when France assumes the group &apos;s presidency this November . 
Sarkozy &apos;s rhetoric suggests that he hankers after new international agreements on exchange rates , and , indeed , perhaps a new global reserve currency . 
There have been actions as well as words . 
Beginning in March 2009 , the Swiss National Bank became the first Western central bank in years to seek to influence its currency &apos;s exchange rate through intervention . 
The Swiss were concerned about the franc &apos;s rise , especially against the euro , and intervened heavily in an attempt to hold it down . 
It is always difficult , even after the event , to decide how effective an intervention strategy has been . 
But the Swiss reported losses of 14 billion francs in the first half of 2010 , without succeeding in stemming exchange-rate appreciation . 
This episode , which other central banks watched with great interest , tended to reinforce the views of those who are skeptical of monetary authorities &quot; ability to manage exchange rates . 
So where does this leave us ? 
No doubt the debate will continue , in the G-20 and elsewhere . 
The underlying problem remains that , while both central banks and finance ministries are unhappy about the excessive volatility of real and nominal exchange rates , they do not understand very well what causes it . 
They may think that , in the long run , parities will reflect developments in relative unit labor costs . 
But the long run can be long indeed , and the influence of speculative capital flows can be substantial and sustained . 
Intervention skeptics , therefore , remain the strong majority . 
While they recognize that Asia &apos;s experience has been rather different , they tend to attribute that to dissimilar capital markets . 
They acknowledge that in some circumstances intervention , or at least the readiness to intervene , may be effective , but only if a number of associated conditions are met . 
In particular , a country planning to intervene must demonstrate that it has an intimidating stockpile of foreign-exchange reserves , and the readiness to use it . 
There must also be a strong political commitment to intervention , and an explicit willingness to accept the consequences for domestic monetary conditions , which may involve an inflation rate that is higher or lower than desired , perhaps for some time . 
And it is likely that there will be a need for exchange controls , certainly on short-term capital flows , whether permanently or from time to time . 
These conditions do not typically apply in Western countries . 
The Swiss have large reserves , but are so interlinked with global capital markets that exchange controls are not a realistic option . 
Most other Western countries , certainly the United States and the United Kingdom , are in no position to invest heavily to maintain a particular exchange rate . 
The London markets have waited 18 long years already for the Bank of England to appear on their screens , and I suspect their wait will continue for some time yet .
