Ending Nuclear Evil 
CAPE TOWN - Eliminating nuclear weapons is the democratic wish of the world &apos;s people . 
Yet no nuclear-armed country currently appears to be preparing for a future without these terrifying devices . 
In fact , all are squandering billions of dollars on modernization of their nuclear forces , making a mockery of United Nations disarmament pledges . 
If we allow this madness to continue , the eventual use of these instruments of terror seems all but inevitable . 
The nuclear power crisis at Japan &apos;s Fukushima power plant has served as a dreadful reminder that events thought unlikely can and do happen . 
It has taken a tragedy of great proportions to prompt some leaders to act to avoid similar calamities at nuclear reactors elsewhere in the world . 
This week , the foreign ministers of five nuclear-armed countries - the United States , Russia , Britain , France , and China - will meet in Paris to discuss progress in implementing the nuclear-disarmament commitments that they made at last year &apos;s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) review conference . 
It will be a test of their resolve to transform the vision of a future free of nuclear arms into reality . 
If they are serious about preventing the spread of these monstrous weapons - and averting their use - they will work energetically and expeditiously to eliminate them completely . 
One standard must apply to all countries : zero . 
Nuclear arms are wicked , regardless of who possesses them . 
The unspeakable human suffering that they inflict is the same whatever flag they may bear . 
So long as these weapons exist , the threat of their use - either by accident or through an act of sheer madness - will remain . 
We must not tolerate a system of nuclear apartheid , in which it is considered legitimate for some states to possess nuclear arms but patently unacceptable for others to seek to acquire them . 
Such a double standard is no basis for peace and security in the world . 
The NPT is not a license for the five original nuclear powers to cling to these weapons indefinitely . 
The International Court of Justice has affirmed that they are legally obliged to negotiate in good faith for the complete elimination of their nuclear forces . 
The New START agreement between the US and Russia , while a step in the right direction , will only skim the surface off the former Cold War foes &quot; bloated nuclear arsenals - which account for 95 % of the global total . 
Furthermore , these and other countries &quot; modernization activities cannot be reconciled with their professed support for a world free of nuclear weapons . 
It is deeply troubling that the US has allocated $ 185 billion to augment its nuclear stockpile over the next decade , on top of the ordinary annual nuclear-weapons budget of more than $ 50 billion . 
Just as unsettling is the Pentagon &apos;s push for the development of nuclear-armed drones - H-bombs deliverable by remote control . 
Russia , too , has unveiled a massive nuclear-weapons modernization plan , which includes the deployment of various new delivery systems . 
British politicians , meanwhile , are seeking to renew their navy &apos;s aging fleet of Trident submarines - at an estimated cost of Â£ 76 billion ( $ 121 billion ) . 
In doing so , they are passing up an historic opportunity to take the lead on nuclear disarmament . 
Every dollar invested in bolstering a country &apos;s nuclear arsenal is a diversion of resources from its schools , hospitals , and other social services , and a theft from the millions around the globe who go hungry or are denied access to basic medicines . 
Instead of investing in weapons of mass annihilation , governments must allocate resources towards meeting human needs . 
The only obstacle we face in abolishing nuclear weapons is a lack of political will , which can - and must - be overcome . 
Two-thirds of UN member states have called for a nuclear-weapons convention similar to existing treaties banning other categories of particularly inhumane and indiscriminate weapons , from biological and chemical arms to anti-personnel land mines and cluster munitions . 
Such a treaty is feasible and must be urgently pursued . 
It is true that nuclear weapons cannot be uninvented , but that does not mean that nuclear disarmament is an impossible dream . 
My own country , South Africa , gave up its nuclear arsenal in the 1990 &quot; s , realizing it was better off without these weapons . 
Around the same time , the newly independent states of Belarus , Kazakhstan , and Ukraine voluntarily relinquished their nuclear arms , and then joined the NPT . 
Other countries have abandoned nuclear-weapons programs , recognizing that nothing good could possibly come from them . 
Global stockpiles have dropped from 68,000 warheads at the height of the Cold War to 20,000 today . 
In time , every government will come to accept the basic inhumanity of threatening to obliterate entire cities with nuclear weapons . 
They will work to achieve a world in which such weapons are no more - where the rule of law , not the rule of force , reigns supreme , and cooperation is seen as the best guarantor of international peace .
