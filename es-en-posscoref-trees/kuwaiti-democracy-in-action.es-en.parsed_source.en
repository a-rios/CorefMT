Kuwaiti Democracy in Action 
Kuwait has just held its eleventh parliamentary election since independence in 1961 . 
Though Kuwait is a monarchy , its parliamentary history has not been placid , and the election campaign reflected ongoing tensions between the royal family and segments of the electorate . 
Originally scheduled for October 2007 , the election was brought forward to break a deadlock between the parliament and the government over the number of electoral districts in the country . 
Currently , there are 25 constituencies nationwide , but reformers have long argued that a smaller number - each with a larger number of voters - would be less susceptible to manipulation by the political elite . 
The 29 members of parliament who support a reduced number of constituencies were unable to agree with the government on a new number . 
As a result , the issue became the focus of a vigorous campaign by discontented Kuwaitis , who gathered in front of the National Assembly building and in universities to voice their criticisms . 
In response , the government removed the redistricting issue from parliament to the constitutional court - an attempt , reformers argued , to hold back change . 
When three members of parliament sought to question the Prime Minister - their right , under the Kuwaiti constitution - the parliament was dissolved and elections called . 
The rules of political life in Kuwait have been worked out over 300 years - since this small area emerged as a self-contained polity . 
The royal family is empowered to administer the country , but through consultation with different sectors , like tribal leaders or merchant groups . 
With independence in 1961 , these rules were codified in a constitution . 
Compared to other Gulf monarchies , the Kuwaiti royal family has limited powers , though constitutional rules have frequently been ignored - charges of vote-rigging marred the 1967 election , and parliamentary dissolution has dotted the country &apos;s history . 
Nevertheless , since the liberation of Kuwait following the Iraqi occupation in August 1990 , the parliament has gained both stability and respect . 
The dissolutions of parliament in 1999 and 2006 were carried out according to the law , and elections were called in a timely fashion . 
Parliament retains the right to interrogate cabinet members , including the Prime Minister , on financial and administrative questions and has frequently passed motions of no confidence in government . 
More recently , with the death last December of the Emir , Sheikh Jabir al-Ahmad , parliamentary approval was exercised a key role in resolving succession debates among factions of the royal family . 
Overall , Kuwait has always had a lively political life , with freedom of expression and less political repression than is common in neighboring countries . 
Political violence has been rare . 
Though political parties have not been legalized , they are nonetheless active in parliament and public life . 
Kuwaiti life reflects the many and varied political trends throughout the Arab world , as the country &apos;s open society and economic opportunities have made it a powerful magnet and regional safety valve since the 1950 &quot; s . 
With this election , Kuwaiti women participated in choosing the parliament for the first time . 
Though women have long been active in Kuwaiti public life , they were enfranchised only last year , after a long and difficult campaign , by a parliamentary vote , and accounted for just 28 of the 249 candidates . 
The voting population is 57 % female , and commentators speculated on the likely impact of women voters . 
Would they follow the voting patterns of their husbands ? 
Clearly , women demonstrated tremendous enthusiasm for the political process , taking part in large numbers in political rallies , and as campaign workers in a range of election activities . 
In the end , while a loose opposition coalition of pro-reform ex-MP &apos;s , Islamists , and liberals gained a majority of the National Assembly &apos;s 50 seats , no woman won . 
The electorate focused almost entirely on the question of electoral districts . 
Most Kuwaitis see this very technical issue as a way of pressing for reform . 
Major regional issues , like the war in Iraq or Iran &apos;s nuclear program , were barely mentioned . 
Islamist candidates were in an awkward position , seeking support from women voters , whose participation they opposed . 
However , Islamists were among the 29 parliamentary deputies pushing for constituency reform , a fact that eased their dilemma . 
Support for reform comes from across the political spectrum , whereas opponents of reform paid a high price . 
Indeed , three members of the outgoing parliament who supported the government were not candidates , having lost in their tribal primaries . 
With pro-reform forces strengthening their position in the new parliament , the government has two choices . 
It can go along with electoral reform , or it can find an opportunity to dissolve the new parliament . 
Already , commentators are speculating on how long the new parliament will survive . 
Whatever the immediate outcome , the Kuwaiti government is facing a new political horizon . 
Women are now the majority of voters , and young people have taken up the reform banner . 
Democracy will push the ruling family forward .
