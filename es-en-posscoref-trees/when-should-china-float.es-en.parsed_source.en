When Should China Float ? 
Under heavy pressure from America , China &apos;s leaders have agreed in principle to float the renminbi , but refuse to say when . 
A floating currency is inevitable as China liberalizes its capital market and eliminates restrictions on international capital movements ; otherwise , China would have to surrender control over its money supply and interest rates to the US . 
Yet China &apos;s rulers are right to postpone the decision to float . 
The Chinese can delay , but they can &apos;t hide from a fundamental economic law : if the exchange rate between the currencies of two countries is fixed and capital flows between them are unrestricted , the economically dominant one will exercise control over the monetary policy of the other . 
Because the dollar is the dominant world reserve currency , and America &apos;s Fed controls the supply of US dollars , as long as China sticks to a fixed exchange rate , it cannot control its own money supply . 
The reason is simple . 
If China attempts to lower its money supply by raising interest rates , it will trigger a corresponding increase in demand for renminbi , as foreign capital seeks to take advantage of higher interest rates on Chinese assets . 
To maintain the fixed exchange rate the Chinese central bank would need to offset this by increasing the money supply - the opposite of what it set out to do in the first place . 
Similarly , any attempt to increase the money supply by lowering interest rates would fail as long as the exchange rate between the renminbi and dollar remains fixed . 
Is this necessarily a problem ? 
If America pursued a policy of price stability and China kept its exchange rate fixed to the dollar , wouldn &apos;t China have price stability as well , without worrying about its money supply , which would , in effect , be set by the Fed ? 
Perhaps , but only if the US did indeed pursue a policy of price stability and if China &apos;s economy were small enough for its domestic prices to be closely linked to the price levels of internationally traded goods . 
Moreover , America can &apos;t be trusted to pursue international price stability . 
So China cannot stabilize its economy by relying on US monetary policy . 
The current conflict between China and the US recalls the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates thirty years ago . 
The dollar was then officially a reserve currency , and the economically dominant US could determine its money supply independently of its external balance of payments . 
This was not true of other countries . 
As international capital and credit markets grew and Europeans increasingly allowed capital to move freely , it became impossible for them to control their money supplies . 
As long as US policy supported stable prices in world markets , the system worked well , notwithstanding the asymmetry and built-in conflict over the control of monetary policy . 
The situation changed in the late 1960 &apos;s , when US monetary policy - loosened by the costly Vietnam War and domestic social programs - became inflationary . 
The rest of the world , particularly Germany , had no choice but to let their currencies float . 
The architects of the Bretton Woods system tried to provide some safeguards against the unilateral opportunism America then exercised . 
The primary check was that other countries could demand conversion of their growing dollar reserves into gold at the fixed price of $ 35 per ounce . 
This they did . 
In the decade after 1958 , almost two thirds of overseas dollars were converted into gold . 
With US gold reserves depleted , President Nixon ended gold convertibility in August 1971 . 
After the brief , unsuccessful attempt at exchange rate realignment known as the Smithsonian Agreement , the world &apos;s major currencies were floated in February 1973 . 
This monetary history is relevant because America is no more likely to accept international constraints on its monetary policy today than in the past . 
The Fed is not prepared to raise interest rates or tighten reserve requirements to restrain economic overheating in Shanghai . 
( For reasons too complicated to explain here , the possibility of China &apos;s converting its reserves from dollars to euros would be just as ineffective a constraint on US policy as the earlier threat of gold conversions . ) 
So China and the US are on a collision course , a replay of the Bretton Woods crisis . 
Barring an unlikely international agreement , China , like Germany in 1973 , will have to let its currency float . 
But the Chinese are right to play for time . 
It would be a mistake to float the renminbi under today &apos;s speculative and external political pressures . 
With the credibility of Chinese economic policy continuing to be based on the fixed exchange rate , any flotation must be part of a larger program of reform . 
Revaluation upward , the inevitable result of floating the renminbi , would increase the burden of renminbi-denominated debt , making the balance sheet problems of Chinese banks and state-owned enterprise harder to correct . 
It is in nobody &apos;s interest to precipitate a financial crisis in China . 
To avoid crisis , China must rein in excessive credit growth and the overheating that results from it . 
Although China will eventually lose its ability to control the supply of renminbi , because capital controls remain in place , China - unlike Germany &apos;s government in the early 1970 &apos;s - can still control the supply of credit and inflow of foreign capital . 
So , for now , China can bring monetary expansion under control while keeping the exchange rate fixed . 
Floating the renmimbi can - and should - wait until China &apos;s bank balance sheet problems have been addressed and its monetary system and capital markets become more developed and ready to play a stable role in global finance .
