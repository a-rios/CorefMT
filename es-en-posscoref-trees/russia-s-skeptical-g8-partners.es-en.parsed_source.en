Russia &apos;s Skeptical G8 Partners 
Poor oil-rich Russia . 
It is trying so hard to have its turn as chair of the elite Group of Eight countries taken seriously . 
President Vladimir Putin , perhaps hoping to elevate the presidential summit talks in St. Petersburg in July , has laid out an ambitious agenda . 
He plans to lead his colleagues in erudite conversations about education , infectious diseases , and - to make sure that no one dozes off - &quot; energy security . &quot; 
And what has Putin gotten for his efforts ? 
Not much . 
The Bush administration , led by Vice President Dick Cheney ( but with his boss &apos;s explicit approval ) , recently accused Russia of backsliding into its old &quot; evil empire &quot; ways . 
Putin shot back , portraying the United States as &quot; Comrade Wolf , &quot; ready to pounce on any nation that leaves itself vulnerable . 
Suspense seems to be building around how Bush and Putin will greet each other when they meet in St. Petersburg . 
Europeans , for their part , are still hysterical about getting caught up in the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute that left their pipelines dry for a few days at the beginning of this year . 
They see discussing &quot; energy security &quot; with Russia as akin to chatting about water safety with Comrade Crocodile . 
Of course , people who really want to be unkind will point out the absurdity of Russia &apos;s membership in a club that includes the giant economies of US , Germany , Japan , England , France , Italy , and ( less so ) Canada . 
Why wasn &apos;t Chinese president Hu Jintao , whose country &apos;s economy is the world &apos;s second largest ( when measured at world prices ) , given a seat at the table instead of Putin ? 
After all , even with all its energy resources , and even with today &apos;s sky-high oil and gas prices , Russia &apos;s national income is only about the size of Greater Los Angeles . 
Perhaps what Putin needs to do is stop suffering all the criticisms and go on the offensive . 
He could start by pointing out to his smugly democratic counterparts that he is probably more popular in Russia today than any of them are in their own countries . 
He might actually win a fair election tomorrow ( not that he would ever risk finding out ) . 
Few of the others could make the same claim with a straight face . 
Of course , Putin &apos;s success over the past few years in killing off any semblance of a free press - and when an ex-KGB man &quot; kills off &quot; a free press , it is not just a figure of speech - has helped mute open opposition . 
Even so , Putin does seem genuinely popular among a public longing for a leader who can anchor their country without sinking it . 
Putin might also argue that Russia &apos;s fiscal position is far stronger that of the other G8 members . 
Yes , it helps that Siberia turned out to be a giant oil well , with the government sucking up much of the money . 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is balancing his country &apos;s books , too , for now . 
But , to be fair , oil is not the whole story . 
Most economists advocate rich countries &quot; replacing their complex and antiquated tax codes with a simple low flat tax , and they bemoan the fact that so few countries have tried it . 
Putin , however , implemented such a policy a few years ago , and the results have been nothing short of miraculous . 
Of course , the other G8 leaders might be less enamored of some of Russia &apos;s other approaches to addressing budget problems . 
Most G8 countries seem incapable of achieving the political consensus required to take necessary steps such as raising the retirement age or significantly cutting the indexation of benefits to inflation . 
Russia , by contrast , has essentially abandoned its pensioners by inflating away the value of their incomes . 
Indeed , many of the elderly in rural Russia are forced to sustain themselves by growing potatoes on the tiny plots of land that the government allows them to till . 
That is , assuming they survive at all : since the fall of the Berlin Wall , Russian male life expectancy has plummeted from 65 years to around 60 years . 
There is growing evidence that the stress of transition is the leading cause of death , even above big killers in postcommunist Russia such as alcohol , murder , and AIDS . 
Should Putin tell his colleagues that they , too , could balance their countries &quot; intergenerational accounts by starving the elderly ? 
So perhaps Putin had better not try to push his country &apos;s accomplishments too far . 
Maybe the best plan is simply to let the vodka flow and hope for a round of smiles in the photo ops . 
In any case , when Putin tells his guests how they can pay Russia more to improve their own &quot; energy security , &quot; he may finally get the respect that he craves .
