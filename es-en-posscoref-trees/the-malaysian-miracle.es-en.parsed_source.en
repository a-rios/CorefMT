The Malaysian Miracle 
August 31 marked the 50th anniversary of Malaysia &apos;s Merdeka : independence after more than 400 years of colonialism . 
Malaysia &apos;s peaceful , non-violent struggle may not have received the attention that Mahatma Gandhi &apos;s did in India , but what Malaysia has accomplished since then is impressive - and has much to teach the world , both about economics , and about how to construct a vibrant multi-racial , multi-ethnic , multi-cultural society . 
The numbers themselves say a lot . 
At independence , Malaysia was one of the poorest countries in the world . 
Though reliable data are hard to come by , its GDP ( in purchasing power parity terms ) was comparable to that of Haiti , Honduras , and Egypt , and some 5 % below that of Ghana . 
Today , Malaysia &apos;s income is 7.8 times that of Ghana , more than five times that of Honduras , and more than 2.5 times that of Egypt . 
In the global growth league tables , Malaysia is in the top tier , along with China , Taiwan , South Korea , and Thailand . 
Moreover , the benefits of the growth have been shared . 
Hard-core poverty is set to be eliminated by 2010 , with the overall poverty rate falling to 2.8 % . 
Malaysia has succeeded in markedly reducing the income divides that separated various ethnic groups , not by bringing the top down , but by bringing the bottom up . 
Part of the country &apos;s success in reducing poverty reflects strong job creation . 
While unemployment is a problem in most of the world , Malaysia has been importing labor . 
In the 50 years since independence , 7.24 million jobs have been created , an increase of 261 % , which would be equivalent to the creation of 105 million jobs in the United States . 
There were many reasons not to have expected Malaysia to be a success . 
Just as Malaysia was gaining its independence , the Nobel Prize winning economist Gunnar Myrdal wrote an influential book called Asian Drama , in which he predicted a bleak future for the region . 
Malaysia is rich in natural resources . 
But , with few exceptions , such countries are afflicted with the so-called &quot; natural resource curse &quot; : countries with an abundance of resources not only do not do as well as expected , but actually do worse than countries without such benefits . 
While natural resource wealth should make it easier to create a more equalitarian society , countries with more resources , on average , are marked by greater inequality . 
Moreover , Malaysia &apos;s multiracial , multi-cultural society made it more vulnerable to civil strife , which has occurred in many other resource-rich countries , as one group tried to seize the wealth for itself . 
In many cases , minorities work hard to garner the fruits of this wealth for themselves , at the expense of the majority - Bolivia , one of the many rich countries with poor people , comes to mind . 
At independence , Malaysia also faced a Communist insurgency . 
The &quot; hearts and minds &quot; of those in the countryside had to be won , and that meant bringing economic benefits and minimizing &quot; collateral &quot; damage to innocent civilians - an important lesson for the Bush administration in Iraq , if it would only listen to someone outside its closed circle . 
And Malaysia had a third strike against it : for all the talk of the &quot; white man &apos;s burden , &quot; the European powers did little to improve living standards in the countries they ruled . 
The dramatic decline in India &apos;s share of global GDP under Britain &apos;s rule , as Britain passed trade laws designed to benefit its textile producers at the expense of those in its colony , is the most visible example . 
The colonial powers &quot; divide-and-rule tactics enabled small populations in Europe to rule large numbers outside of Europe , pillaging natural resources while investing little in the physical , human capital , and social capital necessary for an economically successful , democratic self-governing society . 
It has taken many of the former colonies decades to overcome this legacy . 
How , then , does an economist account for Malaysia &apos;s success ? 
Economically , Malaysia learned from its neighbors . 
Too many of the ex-colonies , rejecting their colonial heritage , turned to Russia and communism . 
Malaysia wisely took an alternative course , looking instead to the highly successful countries of East Asia . 
It invested in education and technology , pushed a high savings rate , enacted a strong and effective affirmative action program , and adopted sound macroeconomic policies . 
Malaysia also recognized that success required an active role for government . 
It eschewed ideology , following or rejecting outsiders &quot; advice on a pragmatic basis . 
Most tellingly , during the financial crisis of 1997 , it did not adopt IMF policies - and as a result had the shortest and shallowest downturn of any of the afflicted countries . 
When it re-emerged , it was not burdened with debt and bankrupt firms like so many of its neighbors . 
This success was , of course , not only a matter of economics : had Malaysia followed the policies recommended by the IMF , it would have torn apart the social fabric created over the preceding four decades . 
Malaysia &apos;s success thus should be studied both by those looking for economic prosperity and those seeking to understand how our world can live together , not just with toleration , but also with respect , sharing their common humanity and working together to achieve common goals .
