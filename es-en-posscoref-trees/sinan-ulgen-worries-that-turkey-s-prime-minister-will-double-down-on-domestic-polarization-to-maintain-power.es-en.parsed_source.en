Erdoğan &apos;s Pyrrhic Victory 
ISTANBUL - Turkey &apos;s beleaguered Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) have emerged victorious from this week &apos;s local elections . 
Still , the AKP &apos;s triumph is unlikely to ameliorate the country &apos;s internal conflicts , much less revive its tarnished international standing . 
The local elections were widely seen as a referendum on Erdoğan . 
The AKP received 44 % of the national vote and now controls 49 of Turkey &apos;s 81 metropolitan municipalities , including Istanbul and the capital , Ankara . 
The main opposition force , the center-left Republican People &apos;s Party ( CHP ) , received 26 % and won only 13 municipalities . 
The outcome can be seen as a vindication of Erdoğan &apos;s strategy of using political polarization to consolidate his support and counter the challenge to his rule posed by followers of his former ally , the US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen . 
With the AKP &apos;s initial support , the Gülen movement gradually infiltrated state institutions , particularly the judiciary and law enforcement , until the alliance eventually ended in an acrimonious split over the distribution of power within Turkey . 
The end result was a dirty war of graft allegations spread through social media , apparently by Gülen &apos;s followers primarily . 
In response , the government has branded its opponents as enemies , and sought to promulgate new laws undermining the independence of the judiciary and restricting freedom of expression - including shutdowns of Twitter and YouTube . 
Erdoğan &apos;s strategy sought to complement this exercise in damage limitation with a demonstration of its popular legitimacy . 
With the AKP &apos;s overwhelming triumph in the local elections , Erdoğan can now justifiably claim that the Turkish electorate backs his approach , including his government &apos;s suspension of the rule of law in order to obstruct corruption investigations that it views as a judicial coup attempted by Gülen &apos;s followers . 
Yet the AKP &apos;s electoral victory heralds two specific dangers for the future of Turkey &apos;s democracy . 
The first is the persistence of intense political polarization in the run-up to the presidential election in August and the parliamentary election in the first half of 2015 . 
In Turkey , polarization does not have the same political costs as it does elsewhere : Given a weak system of checks and balances , the Turkish executive still has ample room to manage the state &apos;s affairs . 
The other danger is that of growing alienation from the West . 
With a renewed popular mandate , the government is likely to begin prosecuting Gülenists for alleged criminal behavior . 
But the creation of a wider siege mentality to boost domestic support also requires the invention of external co-conspirators - global financial markets , the international media , or even Turkey &apos;s NATO allies . 
Such allegations have been a part of the government &apos;s conspiratorial rhetoric since last summer &apos;s protests , and the authorities dismissed the recent corruption accusations against Erdoğan in the same way . 
Turkey &apos;s international standing has thus suffered enormously from Erdoğan &apos;s strategy of internal polarization . 
Long gone are the days when the prospect of accession to the European Union sustained a powerful dynamic of democratic reform . 
With hope of EU membership fading , reform momentum has been lost , and the European Commission is expected to issue a sharply critical progress report in October . 
The bilateral relationship with the United States is also under strain . 
President Barack Obama and Erdoğan rarely speak with one another anymore , whereas Obama once considered Erdoğan among his favorite world leaders . 
Turkey has also lost several regional allies , particularly some of the Gulf monarchies , which are angry at the Erdoğan government &apos;s unconditional support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt . 
Turkey &apos;s much-vaunted soft-power diplomacy and neighborhood policy now lie in tatters . 
Yet Turkey remains a large and important regional power . 
With his popularity reaffirmed , Erdoğan could still move in a different direction . 
Aware of the dangers of extreme polarization and reassured by the level of support obtained by the AKP in the local elections , Erdoğan may opt to lower the political temperature at home in the hope of repairing Turkey &apos;s frayed relations abroad . 
How Erdoğan behaves will not only determine the intensity of domestic political conflict ; it will also greatly affect Turkey &apos;s potential to regain the regional clout that it once enjoyed . 
If Erdoğan believes that a higher level of antagonism is necessary to retain power , he may remain oblivious to the harm done to Turkey &apos;s international standing .
