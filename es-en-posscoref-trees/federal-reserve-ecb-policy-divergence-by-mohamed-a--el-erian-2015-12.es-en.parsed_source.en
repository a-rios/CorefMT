The Great Policy Divergence 
WASHINGTON , DC - Over the next few weeks , the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are likely to put in place notably different policies . 
The Fed is set to raise interest rates for the first time in almost ten years . 
Meanwhile , the ECB is expected to introduce additional unconventional measures to drive rates in the opposite direction , even if that means putting further downward pressure on some government bonds that are already trading at negative nominal yields . 
In implementing these policies , both central banks are pursuing domestic objectives mandated by their governing legislation . 
The problem is that there may be few , if any , orderly mechanisms to manage the international repercussions of this growing divergence . 
The Fed is responding to continued indications of robust job creation in the United States and other signs that the country &apos;s economy is recovering , albeit moderately so . 
Also conscious of the risk to financial stability if interest rates remain at artificially low levels , the Fed is expected to increase them when its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets on December 15-16 . 
The move marks a turning point in the Fed &apos;s approach to the economy . 
In deciding to raise interest rates , it will be doing more than simply lifting its foot from the financial-stimulus accelerator ; it will also be taking a notable step toward the multiyear normalization of its overall policy stance . 
In the meantime , the ECB is facing a very different set of economic conditions , including generally sluggish growth , the risk of deflation , and worries about the impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris on business and consumer confidence . 
As a result , the bank &apos;s decision-makers are giving serious consideration to pushing the discount rate further into negative territory and extending its large-scale asset-purchase program ( otherwise known as quantitative easing ) . 
In other words , the ECB is likely to expand and extend experimental measures that will press even harder on the financial-stimulus accelerator . 
In a perfect world , policymakers would have assessed the potential for international spillovers from these divergent policies ( including possible spillbacks on both sides of the Atlantic ) and put in place a range of instruments to ensure a better alignment of domestic and global objectives . 
Unfortunately , political polarization and general policy dysfunction in both the US and the European Union continue to inhibit such an effort . 
As a result , lacking a more comprehensive policy response , the harmonization of their central banks &quot; divergent policies will be left to the markets - in particular , those for fixed-income assets and currencies . 
Already , the interest-rate differential between &quot; risk-free &quot; bonds on both sides of the Atlantic - say , US Treasuries and German Bunds - has widened notably . 
And , at the same time , the dollar has strengthened not only against the euro , but also against most other currencies . 
Left unchecked , these trends are likely to persist . 
If history is any guide , there are three major issues that warrant careful monitoring in the coming months . 
First , the US is unlikely to stand by for long if its currency appreciates significantly and its international competitiveness deteriorates substantially . 
Companies are already reporting earning pressures due to the rising dollar , and some are even asking their governments to play a more forceful role in countering a stealth &quot; currency war . &quot; 
Second , because the dollar is used as a reserve currency , a rapid rise in its value could put pressure on those who have used it imprudently . 
At particular risk are emerging-country companies that , having borrowed overwhelmingly in dollars but generating only limited dollar earnings , might have large currency mismatches in their assets and liabilities or their incomes and expenditures . 
And , finally , sharp movements in interest rates and exchange rates can cause volatility in other markets , most notably for equities . 
Because regulatory controls and market constraints have made brokers less able to play a countercyclical role by accumulating inventory on their balance sheets , the resulting price instability is likely to be large . 
There is a risk that some portfolios will be forced into disordered unwinding . 
Furthermore , the central banks &quot; policy of curtailing so-called &quot; volatile volatility &quot; is likely to be challenged . 
Of course , none of these outcomes is preordained . 
Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have the ability to lower the risk of instability by implementing structural reforms , ensuring more balanced aggregate demand , removing pockets of excessive indebtedness , and smoothing out the mechanisms of multilateral and regional governance . 
The three possible outcomes of all this include a relatively stable multi-speed world , notable disruptions that undermine the US &apos;s economic recovery , and a European revival that benefits from US growth . 
The good news is that the impact of the divergence will depend on how policymakers manage its pressures . 
The bad news is that they have yet to find the political will to act decisively to minimize the risks . 
As the Fed normalizes its monetary policy and the ECB doubles down on extraordinary measures , we certainly should hope for the best . 
But we should also be planning for a substantial rise in financial and economic uncertainty .
