China &apos;s Choice in North Korea 
TOKYO - If the most dangerous moment for any dictatorship is when it starts to reform , North Korea looks ready to turn that truism on its head . 
Its recent shelling of South Korea suggests that the failing Kim dynasty might set East Asia alight rather than undertake any serious reform . 
If peace really is the key component of China &apos;s rise , the Chinese must now rein in their mercurial client . 
Trying to understand the &quot; Hermit Kingdom &quot; can be like staring into a black hole . 
Some view the bombardment of South Korea &apos;s Yeonpyeong Island as a bid to divert North Koreans &quot; attention from their country &apos;s collapsing economy , or perhaps from the approaching death of their &quot; Dear Leader , &quot; Kim Jong-il , or to create a synthetic reputation as a military leader for Kim &apos;s son and intended heir , the 27-year-old ( or so ) &quot; Young General , &quot; Kim Jong-un . 
Others view the attack as simply another in a long line of provocations , and thus not to be taken all that seriously . 
Hwang Jang-yop , North Korea &apos;s former chief ideologist and its most senior defector to the South , describes North Korea as a mixture of &quot; socialism , modern feudalism , and militarism . &quot; 
It has proven to be a lethal combination . 
Roughly 1.5 million of North Korea &apos;s 23 million people are estimated to have starved to death over the past decade . 
Hunger remains widespread , if not as dire as two years ago . 
The standard daily ration is 150-300 grams ( 5-10 ounces ) of corn or rice ( equivalent to roughly four slices of dry bread ) , depending on the location . 
Food often remains unavailable in rural areas . 
Atop North Korea &apos;s starvation economy sits a personality cult that dwarfs those of Stalin or Mao . 
Ubiquitous images of Kim Jong-il and his father , Kim Il-sung , are the official symbols of a secular theocracy based on juche ( pronounced choocheh ) , the Kims &quot; contribution to the world &apos;s patrimony of totalitarian ideologies . 
As with the Church or the divine right of kings , the system cannot be challenged without undermining the infallibility of its perfect leaders . 
The third and seemingly scariest component of Hwang &apos;s formula , militarism , may in fact prove to be the system &apos;s Achilles heel . 
Maintaining the world &apos;s fifth-largest army in a perpetual state of combat readiness is crushingly expensive for one of its poorest countries , with the military budget claiming an estimated one-third of GDP . 
The armed forces operate a parallel economy , with its own mines , farms , and factories , though many soldiers and junior officers still go hungry . 
The permanent war footing is just one manifestation of North Korea &apos;s obsession with rugged self-sufficiency . 
Juche is autarky raised to the level of philosophy . 
The North Koreans consider any reliance on the outside world as a source of weakness , even though their economy would collapse without Chinese handouts . 
Because North Korea does not repay loans , it cannot borrow money ; because it reneges on deals , it drives away potential partners ; and , because it aims for autarky , it cannot specialize or exploit its comparative advantages . 
As a result , its annual exports - which include film and television animation , reconditioned cars , and , inevitably , an illicit trade in arms - are worth less than $ 1 billion . 
Not surprisingly , defectors nowadays describe an environment of social breakdown , petty crime , and a Darwinian struggle for survival . 
There is despondency and latent unrest . 
So what is Kim up to with this latest attack on South Korea ? 
Kim &apos;s main target was surely the six-party talks between his regime and the United States , United Nations , China , Russia , South Korea , and Japan . 
Previously , North Korea was offered economic and other inducements to give up its nuclear weapons . 
Like Iran , however , Kim wants to have his cake and eat it : eventual acceptance as a nuclear power and all the economic enticements from the US , Europe , Russia , and China to de-nuclearize . 
That might seem crazy , especially given the likelihood of another round of economically crippling sanctions following the bombardment . 
He has always shown scant regard for his people &apos;s plight , and he still expects to get two-thirds or more of the oil and food he needs from China . 
In the face of the North &apos;s provocations , South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has demonstrated more of the statesmanship he showed in the recent G-20 summit in Seoul , when he successfully crafted a new focus on development for the group . 
President Lee &apos;s allies have rallied , rightly , to his cause , but even we recognize that his restraint cannot be unending . 
Much , then , depends on the Chinese , whose self-defeating regional diplomacy has managed to push a listless and defense-shy Japanese government into closer cooperation with the US on security matters , and has inspired South Korea to seek out strategic partnerships with other Asian powers , including India . 
One hopes that North Korea &apos;s recent behavior - the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March , and now the shelling of Yeonpyeong island ( which followed a supposedly &quot; accidental &quot; shooting incident in the DMZ in October ) - will focus minds in Beijing . 
But China , which fears a collapse of the North Korean regime above all , does not want to antagonize Kim . 
The result could be a new round of efforts by China to manipulate regional suspicion - or worse . 
Alternatively , China could shoulder some real responsibility for security in East Asia and close ranks against Kim and his reckless brinksmanship . 
That should start with support for a clear condemnation of North Korea by the UN Security Council . 
That global effort will almost certainly not succeed without a credible Chinese threat to sever Kim &apos;s economic umbilical cord .
