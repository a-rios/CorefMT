A Time to Build 
Any good international investment banker knows that the end of April is a bad time to come peddling his services , for that is when the world &apos;s finance ministers return home from the IMF meetings in Washington , chastened that risks to the global economy could spill over into their own backyards . 
Ministers are too busy recovering from their trauma to think about paying fat fees for big new international bond issues . 
Who wants to build up debt if there might be a financial crisis around the corner ? 
Better to keep socking away US Treasury bills , even if the return is far lower than on most other investments . 
Or is it ? 
With today &apos;s global economy in the middle of a sustained and increasingly balanced expansion , has the time come to start considering upside risks ? 
In particular , should governments , especially those that are endlessly building up dollar reserves , instead start thinking about how to build up their roads , bridges , ports , electric grids , and other infrastructure ? 
Has the time come to start laying the groundwork to sustain future growth , especially in poorer regions that have not yet shared in today &apos;s prosperity ? 
Don &apos;t get me wrong , I am not arguing for fiscal profligacy . 
But the balance of risks has shifted over the past few years . 
Yes , within the next three to five years , there will probably be another global recession . 
And , yes , there will probably be another rash of financial crises - perhaps in Central Europe , which now looks like Asia did before its 1997 crisis . 
Recent jitters about Iceland &apos;s gaping trade deficit and Brazil &apos;s new finance minister rippled around the world , reminding global investors that while many emerging markets are gradually moving towards investment-grade status , most are not there yet . 
But the risks are two-sided , and sound economic policy is just as much about capitalizing on good times as avoiding bad ones . 
Economic gurus at places like the World Bank have developed a ridiculously long list of steps that countries should take to raise their growth rates ( the so-called &quot; extended Washington Consensus &quot; ) . 
Like maintaining good health , it is not enough to concentrate on a single component . 
But if there is one area where obvious opportunities exist , and where policy can really make a difference , it would have to be infrastructure investment . 
India &apos;s infrastructure problems are legendary , with airports and railroads that are comically inadequate . 
However , aside from a few countries - including China , of course , but also Spain - low infrastructure spending is epidemic . 
Even the United States has infrastructure that is hobbled by neglect , with collapsing bridges and a dangerously overburdened electrical grid . 
Land-rich Brazil , too , is a case study in the consequences of under-investment . 
Its infrastructure systems might be adequate to support the country &apos;s tepid 3-4 % growth rates , but they are hardly adequate to support the 6-7 % rates that it ought to be enjoying amidst the current global boom . 
Russia , despite Siberia &apos;s massive oil and gas riches , isn &apos;t even investing enough to support healthy growth in its energy industries , much less human development in the country &apos;s impoverished areas ( including hapless Siberia ) . 
True , government infrastructure spending is often wasted . 
My hometown of Boston recently managed to spend an astounding $ 15 billion dollars to move a few highways underground . 
And that so-called &quot; Big Dig &quot; looks like a model of efficiency next to many of Japan &apos;s infamous bridges to nowhere . 
But there are ways to waste less . 
Transparency in procurement works wonders . 
The Nobel laureate economist William Vickrey argued tirelessly in favor of privately financed toll roads . 
Private oversight can often produce better and more efficient construction , and , in theory , toll roads help alleviate traffic congestion . 
( Ironically , Vickery died while sitting in a traffic jam . ) 
Even China , which has added more than 50,000 kilometers of roads and dozens of airports over the past five years , makes use of private financing . 
True , countries that have not cleaned up their fiscal act , such as India , must not recklessly plunge ahead with big government projects without counterbalancing reforms to ensure sustainability . 
Fiscal prudence and stable inflation rates are cornerstones of today &apos;s relatively healthy global economic environment . 
But for countries that have scope to invest more , particularly those that are holding a surfeit of precious development dollars in idle US Treasury bills , the time may be ripe to reassess the balance of risks . 
The IMF is absolutely right to remind ministers each April of downside risks . 
Countries &quot; need for better infrastructure is no license to throw prudence out the window . 
But when the world &apos;s finance ministers recover from their April shock therapy , they also need to look at the opportunities .
