Super-Sizing the IMF is Wrong 
CAMBRIDGE - As the global financial crisis radiates out from the developed economies into emerging markets , it is ravaging not only governance-challenged economies such as Venezuela , Russia , and Argentina . 
The crisis is also striking countries like Brazil , Korea , and South Africa , which appeared to have made substantial and lasting progress towards macroeconomic stability . 
For this reason , the future shape of the International Monetary Fund is rapidly moving to the top of the agenda for world leaders as they prepare to meet in Washington in mid-November to discuss the future of the global financial system . 
Just a short time ago , the IMF seemed relegated to a sustained period of irrelevance as it failed to modernize either its euro-centric political representation or its arcane government-to-government lending facilities . 
Suddenly , the Fund has moved to center stage as the only agency seemingly capable of stemming the vicious downward spiral that is currently seizing emerging-market stocks and bonds . 
World leaders should be happy that the IMF stands ready to take the lead in the next phase of the global financial crisis , even if its lending resources of approximately $ 250 billion are inadequate to stem the current run on emerging markets . 
Emerging-market companies alone have hundreds of billions coming due in the next twelve months , far more than their governments &quot; reserves can cover if credit markets do not normalize . 
Unlike United States Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke , most emerging-market central bankers are in no position to extend blank checks across their economies without a boomerang effect on interest rates and exchange rates . 
( We will see how investors judge the dollar once the smoke clears and the huge expansion of US money and debt becomes evident . ) 
But it would be a terrible mistake simply to super-size the IMF in its current guise by greatly scaling up its lending facilities , as many propose . 
Rather , the Fund &apos;s role , even in the current crisis , should be sharpened as an interlocutor between lenders and developing country borrowers , rather than simply as a replacement for all other loan sources . 
The key reforms for the IMF remain ( 1 ) improving governance by reducing European representation while increasing that of Asia , and ( 2 ) focusing the Fund &apos;s mission on monitoring and surveillance rather than as a direct provider of bailout loans . 
Contrary to popular opinion , now is exactly the right time to make these changes . 
Rich country governments , led by central banks , should provide the large scale funding needed to stem the run on developing country finances . 
The Fund &apos;s main role should be in monitoring . 
Without its own currency , the IMF is poorly positioned to intervene with the overwhelming force needed for lender-of-last-resort operations . 
In principle , the IMF could be allowed to print money ( it already has its own accounting unit , the so-called Special Drawing Rights ) . 
But this is not realistic , given the lack of an adequate system for global governance . 
Even the euro area , which is far more cohesive than the world as a whole , has not quite figured out how to use its central bank as lender of last resort . 
The IMF &apos;s lending resources have shrunk dramatically relative to world trade and income compared over the past 50 years . 
But increasing its resources to a trillion dollars or more is not a realistic option , either . 
The IMF does not have an adequate framework for handling the massive defaults that could easily attend a huge surge in lending , much less the political will to distinguish between countries that are facing genuine short-term liquidity problems and countries that are actually facing insolvency problems . 
So what should world leaders do with the IMF ? In the short run , the IMF could help coordinate additional loans from countries such as the US , Japan , and China , to help maintain economic and political stability in the developing world . 
Without directly acknowledging America &apos;s central role in causing the financial crisis , the US Federal Reserve has already offered to exchange up to $ 30 billion each with the central banks of Korea , Brazil , Mexico and Singapore . 
The IMF can also play a useful role in helping surplus countries manage their foreign exchange reserves , much as the Bank for International Settlements already does . World leaders can allow the IMF to sell some of its gold stock to endow the agency with enough cash to fund its monitoring and surveillance functions . Then in the future , it will not need to make crisis loans just to keep the lights on in the building . 
As tempting as it may be to ramp up IMF lending on a long-term basis , this would be a strategic mistake for both the world and the Fund . 
The rich countries , together with China and the Middle East oil exporters do indeed need to take bold steps to help out emerging markets , and the Fund has a useful role to play . 
But super-sizing the Fund , without sufficient governance improvements and lending constraints , would give the world too much of a good thing .
