The Emotional Clash of Civilizations 
Throughout the so-called &quot; war on terror , &quot; the notion of a &quot; clash of civilization &quot; between Islam and the West has usually been dismissed as politically incorrect and intellectually wrongheaded . 
Instead , the most common interpretation has been that the world has entered a new era characterized by conflict &quot; within &quot; a particular civilization , namely Islam , with fundamentalist Muslims as much at war against moderates as against the West . 
The strategic conclusion derived from such an analysis was clear , ambitious , and easily summarized : democratization . 
If the absence of democracy in the Islamic world was the problem , bringing democracy to the &quot; Greater Middle-East would be the solution , and it was the historical duty of the United States , as the most powerful and moral nation , to bring about that necessary change . 
The status quo was untenable . 
Implementing democracy , with or without regime change , was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism . 
Today , Iraq may be on the verge of civil war between Shiites and Sunnis . 
Iran under a new and more radical president is moving irresistibly towards possessing a nuclear capacity . 
A free electoral process brought Hamas to power in Palestine , and the unfortunate episode of the Danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the almost combustible nature of relations between Islam and the West . 
All of these developments are paving the way to new interpretations . 
Rather than a &quot; clash of civilizations , &quot; we might instead be faced by multiple layers of conflict , which interact with each other in ways that increase global instability . 
Indeed , it appears that the world is witnessing a triple conflict . 
There is a clash within Islam , which , if the violence in Iraq spreads to neighboring countries , risks causing regional destabilization . 
There is also a clash that is best described not as being between Islam and the West , but between the secularized world and a growing religious one . 
At an even deeper and atavistic level , there is an emotional clash between a culture of fear and a culture of humiliation . 
It would be a gross oversimplification to speak , as some are doing , of a clash between civilization and barbarism . 
In reality , we are confronted with a widening divide over the role of religion , which runs between the West ( with the US being a complicated exception ) and much of the rest of the world ( the most notable exception being China ) , but particularly the Islamic world . 
The divide reflects how religion defines an individual &apos;s identity within a society . 
At a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere , we Europeans have largely forgotten our ( violent and intolerant ) religious past , and we have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in other peoples &quot; daily lives . 
In some ways , &quot; they &quot; are our own buried past and , with a combination of ignorance , prejudice , and , above all , fear , &quot; we &quot; are afraid that &quot; they &quot; could define our future . 
We live in a secular world , where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery , while others see religion as their supreme goal , if not their last hope . 
They have tried everything , from nationalism to regionalism , from communism to capitalism . 
Since everything has failed , why not give God a chance ? 
Globalization may not have created these layers of conflicts , but it has accelerated them by making the differences more visible and palpable . 
In our globalized age , we have lost the privilege - and , paradoxically , the virtue - of ignorance . 
We all see how others feel and react , but without the minimal historical and cultural tools necessary to decipher those reactions . 
Globalization has paved the way to a world dominated by the dictatorship of emotions - and of ignorance . 
This clash of emotions is exacerbated in the case of Islam . 
In the Arab world , in particular , Islam is dominated by a culture of humiliation felt by the people and nations that consider themselves the main losers , the worst victims , of a new and unjust international system . 
From that standpoint , the Israel-Palestine conflict is exemplary . 
It has become an obsession . 
It is not so much that Arabs and Muslims really care about the Palestinians . 
On the contrary , the Islamic world left the Palestinians without real support for decades . 
In reality , for them the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of an unfair colonial order , to represent their political malaise , and to embody the perceived impossibility of their being masters of their destiny . 
In the eyes of the Arabs ( and some other Muslims ) , Israel &apos;s strength and resilience is a direct consequence of their own weakness , divisions , and corruption . 
The majority of Arabs may not support al-Qaeda , but they do not oppose it with all their heart . 
Instead , there is the temptation to regard Osama bin Laden as a type of violent Robin Hood , whose actions , while impossible to condone officially , have helped them to recover a sense of Arab pride and dignity . 
Here , perhaps , is the real clash of civilizations : the emotional conflict between the European culture of fear and the Muslim , particularly Arab , culture of humiliation . 
It would be dangerous to underestimate the depth of so wide an emotional divide , and to recognize its existence is the first step to overcoming it . 
But that will be difficult , for transcending the emotional clash of civilizations presupposes an opening to the &quot; other &quot; that neither side may yet be ready to undertake .
