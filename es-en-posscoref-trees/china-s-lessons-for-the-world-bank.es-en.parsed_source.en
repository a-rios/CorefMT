China &apos;s Lessons for the World Bank 
The China Daily recently ran a front-page story recounting how Paul Wolfowitz used threats and vulgarities to pressure senior World Bank staff . 
The newspaper noted that Wolfowitz sounded like a character out of the mafia television show The Sopranos . 
At the same time , while the Wolfowitz scandal unfolded , China was playing host to the Africa Development Bank ( ADB ) , which held its Board meeting in Shanghai . 
This is a vivid metaphor for today &apos;s world : while the World Bank is caught up in corruption and controversy , China skillfully raises its geopolitical profile in the developing world . 
China &apos;s rising power is , of course , based heavily on its remarkable economic success . 
The ADB meeting took place in the Pudong District , Shanghai &apos;s most remarkable development site . 
From largely unused land a generation ago , Pudong has become a booming center of skyscrapers , luxury hotels , parks , industry , and vast stretches of apartment buildings . 
Shanghai &apos;s overall economy is currently growing at around 13 % per year , thus doubling in size every five or six years . 
Everywhere there are startups , innovations , and young entrepreneurs hungry for profits . 
I had the chance to participate in high-level meetings between Chinese and African officials at the ADB meetings . 
The advice that the African leaders received from their Chinese counterparts was sound , and much more practical than they typically get from the World Bank . 
Chinese officials stressed the crucial role of public investments , especially in agriculture and infrastructure , to lay the basis for private-sector-led growth . 
In a hungry and poor rural economy , as China was in the 1970 &quot; s and as most of Africa is today , a key starting point is to raise farm productivity . 
Peasant farmers need the benefits of fertilizer , irrigation , and high-yield seeds , all of which were a core part of China &apos;s economic takeoff . 
Two other critical investments are also needed : roads and electricity , without which there cannot be a modern economy . 
Farmers might be able to increase their output , but it won &apos;t be able to reach the cities , and the cities won &apos;t be able to provide the countryside with inputs . 
The officials stressed how the government has taken pains to ensure that the power grid and transportation network reaches every village in China . 
Of course , the African leaders were most appreciative of the next message : China is prepared to help Africa in substantial ways in agriculture , roads , power , health , and education . 
All over Africa , China is financing and constructing basic infrastructure . 
During the meeting , the Chinese leaders emphasized their readiness to support agricultural research as well . 
They described new high-yield rice varieties , which they are prepared to share with their African counterparts . 
All of this illustrates what is wrong with the World Bank , even aside from Wolfowitz &apos;s failed leadership . 
Unlike the Chinese , the Bank has too often forgotten the most basic lessons of development , preferring to lecture the poor and force them to privatize basic infrastructure , rather than to help the poor to invest in infrastructure and other crucial sectors . 
The Bank &apos;s failures began in the early 1980 &quot; s , when , under the ideological sway of President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , it tried to get Africa and other poor regions to cut back or close down government investments and services . 
For 25 years , the Bank tried to get governments out of agriculture , leaving impoverished peasants to fend for themselves . 
The result has been a disaster in Africa , with farm productivity stagnant for decades . 
The Bank also pushed for privatization of national health systems , water utilities , and road and power networks , and grossly underfinanced these critical sectors . 
This extreme free-market ideology , also called &quot; structural adjustment , &quot; went against the practical lessons of development successes in China and the rest of Asia . 
Practical development strategy recognizes that public investments - in agriculture , health , education , and infrastructure - are necessary complements to private investments . 
The World Bank has instead wrongly seen such vital public investments as an enemy of private-sector development . 
Whenever the Bank &apos;s extreme free-market ideology failed , it has blamed the poor for corruption , mismanagement , or lack of initiative . 
This was Wolfowitz &apos;s approach , too . 
Instead of focusing the Bank &apos;s attention on helping the poorest countries to improve their infrastructure , he launched a crusade against corruption . 
Ironically , of course , his stance became untenable when his own misdeeds came to light . 
The Bank can regain its relevance only if it becomes practical once again , by returning its focus to financing public investments in priority sectors , just as the Chinese leadership is prepared to do . 
The good news is that African governments are getting the message on how to spur economic growth , and are also getting crucial help from China and other partners that are less wedded to extreme free-market ideology than the World Bank . 
Many African governments at the Shanghai meeting declared their intention to act boldly , by investing in infrastructure , agricultural modernization , public health , and education . 
The Wolfowitz debacle should be a wake-up call to the World Bank : it must no longer be controlled by ideology . 
If that happens , the Bank can still do justice to the bold vision of a world of shared prosperity that prompted its creation after World War II .
