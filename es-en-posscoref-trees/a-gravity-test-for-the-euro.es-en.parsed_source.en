A Gravity Test for the Euro 
CAMBRIDGE - Although I appreciate that exchange rates are never easy to explain or understand , I find today &apos;s relatively robust value for the euro somewhat mysterious . 
Do the gnomes of currency markets seriously believe that the eurozone governments &quot; latest &quot; comprehensive package &quot; to save the euro will hold up for more than a few months ? 
The new plan relies on a questionable mix of dubious financial-engineering gimmicks and vague promises of modest Asian funding . 
Even the best part of the plan , the proposed ( but not really agreed ) 50 % haircut for private-sector holders of Greek sovereign debt , is not sufficient to stabilize that country &apos;s profound debt and growth problems . 
So how is it that the euro is trading at a 40 % premium to the US dollar , even as investors continue to view southern European government debt with great skepticism ? 
I can think of one very good reason why the euro needs to fall , and six not-so-convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate . 
Let &apos;s begin with why the euro needs to fall . 
Absent a clear path to a much tighter fiscal and political union , which can lead only through constitutional change , the current halfway house of the euro system appears increasingly untenable . 
It seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy far greater quantities of eurozone sovereign ( junk ) bonds . 
That may work in the short term , but if sovereign default risks materialize - as my research with Carmen Reinhart suggests is likely - the ECB will in turn have to be recapitalized . 
And , if the stronger northern eurozone countries are unwilling to digest this transfer - and political resistance runs high - the ECB may be forced to recapitalize itself through money creation . 
Either way , the threat of a profound financial crisis is high . 
Given this , what arguments support the current value of the euro , or its further rise ? 
First , investors might be telling themselves that in the worst-case scenario , the northern European countries will effectively push out the weaker countries , creating a super-euro . 
But , while this scenario has a certain ring of truth , surely any breakup would be highly traumatic , with the euro diving before its rump form recovered . 
Second , investors may be remembering that even though the dollar was at the epicenter of the 2008 financial panic , the consequences radiated so widely that , paradoxically , the dollar actually rose in value . 
Although it may be difficult to connect the dots , it is perfectly possible that a huge euro crisis could have a snowball effect in the US and elsewhere . 
Perhaps the transmission mechanism would be through US banks , many of which remain vulnerable , owing to thin capitalization and huge portfolios of mortgages booked far above their market value . 
Third , foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be keen to keep buying up euros to hedge against risks to the US and their own economies . 
Government investors are not necessarily driven by the return-maximizing calculus that motivates private investors . 
If foreign official demand is the real reason behind the euro &apos;s strength , the risk is that foreign sovereign euro buyers will eventually flee , just as private investors would , only in a faster and more concentrated way . 
Fourth , investors may believe that , ultimately , US risks are just as large as Europe &apos;s . 
True , the US political system seems stymied in coming up with a plan to stabilize medium-term budget deficits . 
Whereas the US Congress &apos;s &quot; supercommittee , &quot; charged with formulating a fiscal-consolidation package , will likely come up with a proposal , it is far from clear that either Republicans or Democrats will be willing to accept compromise in an election year . 
Moreover , investors might be worried that the US Federal Reserve will weigh in with a third round of &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; which would further drive down the dollar . 
Fifth , the current value of the euro does not seem wildly out of line on a purchasing-power basis . 
An exchange rate of $ 1.4 : â‚¬ 1 is cheap for Germany &apos;s export powerhouse , which could probably operate well even with a far stronger euro . 
For the eurozone &apos;s southern periphery , however , today &apos;s euro rate is very difficult to manage . 
Whereas some German companies persuaded workers to accept wage cuts to help weather the financial crisis , wages across the southern periphery have been marching steadily upwards , even as productivity has remained stagnant . 
But , because the overall value of the euro has to be a balance of the eurozone &apos;s north and south , one can argue that 1.4 is within a reasonable range . 
Finally , investors might just believe that the eurozone leaders &quot; latest plan will work , even though the last dozen plans have failed . 
Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying &quot; You can fool some of the people all of the time , and all of the people some of the time , but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time . &quot; 
A comprehensive euro fix will surely arrive for some of the countries at some time , but not for all of the countries anytime soon . 
So , yes , there are plenty of vaguely plausible reasons why the euro , despite its drawn-out crisis , has remained so firm against the dollar so far . 
But don &apos;t count on a stable euro-dollar exchange rate - much less an even stronger euro - in the year ahead .
