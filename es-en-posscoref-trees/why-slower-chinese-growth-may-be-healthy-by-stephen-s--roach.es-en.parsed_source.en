Long Live China &apos;s Slowdown 
NEW HAVEN - At 7.7 % , China &apos;s annual GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was slower than many expected . 
While the data were hardly devastating relative to a consensus forecast of 8.2 % , many ( including me ) expected a second consecutive quarterly rebound from the slowdown that appeared to have ended in the third quarter of 2012 . 
China doubters around the world were quick to pounce on the number , expressing fears of a stall , or even a dreaded double dip . 
But slower GDP growth is actually good for China , provided that it reflects the long-awaited structural transformation of the world &apos;s most dynamic economy . 
The broad outlines of this transformation are well known - a shift from export- and investment-led growth to an economic structure that draws greater support from domestic private consumption . 
Less well known is that a rebalanced China should have a slower growth rate - the first hints of which may now be evident . 
A rebalanced China can grow more slowly for one simple reason : By drawing increased support from services-led consumer demand , China &apos;s new model will embrace a more labor-intensive growth recipe . 
The numbers seem to bear that out . 
China &apos;s services sector requires about 35 % more jobs per unit of GDP than do manufacturing and construction - the primary drivers of the old model . 
That number has potentially huge implications , because it means that China could grow at an annual rate in the 7-8 % range and still achieve its objectives with respect to employment and poverty reduction . 
China has struggled to attain these goals with anything less than 10 % growth , because the old model was not generating enough jobs per unit of output . 
As Chinese manufacturing moved up the value chain , firms increasingly replaced workers with machines embodying the latest technologies . 
As a result , its economic model spawned a labor-saving , capital-intensive growth dynamic . 
On one level , that made sense . 
Capital-labor substitution is at the heart of modern productivity strategies for manufacturing-based economies . 
But it left China in a deepening hole : increasingly deficient in jobs per unit of output , it needed more units of output to absorb its surplus labor . 
Ultimately , that became more of a problem than a solution . 
The old manufacturing model , which fueled an unprecedented 20-fold increase in per capita income relative to the early 1990 &quot; s , also sowed the seeds of excessive resource consumption and environmental degradation . 
Services-led growth is , in many ways , the antidote to the &quot; unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and ultimately unsustainable &quot; growth model that former Premier Wen Jiabao &apos;s famously criticized in 2007 . 
Yet services offer more than just a labor-intensive growth path . 
Compared to manufacturing , they have much smaller resource and carbon footprints . 
A services-led model provides China with an alternative , environmentally friendlier , and ultimately more sustainable economic structure . 
It is premature , of course , to conclude that a services-led transformation to slower growth is now at hand . 
The latest data hint at such a possibility , with the tertiary sector ( services ) expanding at an 8.3 % annual rate in the first quarter of this year - the third consecutive quarter of acceleration and a half-percentage point faster than the 7.8 % first-quarter gain recorded by the secondary sector ( manufacturing and construction ) . 
But it will take more than a few quarters of mildly encouraging data to validate such an important shift in the Chinese economy &apos;s underlying structure . 
Not surprisingly , China skeptics are putting a different spin on the latest growth numbers . 
Fears of a shadow-bank-induced credit bubble now top the worry list , reinforcing longstanding concerns that China may succumb to the dreaded &quot; middle-income trap &quot; - a sustained growth slowdown that has ensnared most high-growth emerging economies at the juncture that China has now reached . 
China is hardly immune to such a possibility . 
But it is unlikely to occur if China can carry out the services-led pro-consumption rebalancing that remains the core strategic initiative of its current ( 12th ) Five-Year Plan . 
Invariably , the middle-income trap afflicts those emerging economies that cling to early-stage development models for too long . 
For China , the risk will be highest if it sticks with the timeworn recipe of unbalanced manufacturing- and construction-led growth , which has created such serious sustainability problems . 
If China fails to rebalance , weak external demand from a crisis-battered developed world will continue to hobble its export machine , forcing it to up the ante on a credit- and investment-led growth model - in effect , doubling down on resource-intensive and environmentally damaging growth . 
But I remain hopeful that China &apos;s new leadership team will move quickly to implement its new model . 
There are no viable alternatives . 
Financial markets , as well as growth-starved developed economies , are not thrilled with the natural rhythm of slower growth that a rebalanced Chinese economy is likely to experience . 
Resource industries - indeed , resource-based economies like Australia , Canada , Brazil , and Russia - have become addicted to China &apos;s old strain of unsustainable hyper-growth . 
Yet China knows that it is time to break that dangerous habit . 
The United States is likely to have a different problem with consumer-led growth in China . 
After all , higher private consumption implies an end to China &apos;s surplus saving - and thus to the seemingly open-ended recycling of that surplus into dollar-based assets such as US Treasury bills . 
Who will then fund America &apos;s budget deficit - and on what terms ? 
Just as China must embrace slower growth as a natural consequence of its rebalancing imperative , the rest of the world will need to figure out how to cope when it does .
