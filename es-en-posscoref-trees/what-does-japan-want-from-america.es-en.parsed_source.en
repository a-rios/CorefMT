What Does Japan Want from America ? 
OSAKA - Three months after the Democratic Party of Japan &apos;s landslide general-election victory , the new administration &apos;s foreign and security policy appears to be increasingly at odds with that of the United States . 
Indeed , there is growing concern on both sides of the Pacific that Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama intends to turn away from the declining US hegemon and reach out to a rising China . 
Indeed , Hatoyama has announced his rudimentary vision of building an East Asian community that excludes the US . 
Hatoyama has hastily attempted to fulfill the DPJ &apos;s party manifesto and his own public pledges . 
Moreover , Hatoyama is set to expose a secret Cold War nuclear agreement that opened Japanese ports to US naval vessels carrying nuclear weapons , in contravention of Japan &apos;s Three Non-Nuclear Principles , which have guided official policy since the late 1960 &quot; s . 
Last but not least , Hatoyama is postponing implementation of a bilateral agreement with the US to relocate a Marine Corps base on the island of Okinawa , from Futenma to Henoko , thereby causing confusion for America &apos;s plan to relocate part of its forces on Okinawa to Guam . 
The significance of these moves has , however , been poorly understood . 
Hatoyama &apos;s assertiveness vis-Ã -vis the US is in accord with Japan &apos;s position as the world &apos;s largest creditor with the least damaged banking sector . 
Instead , Hatoyama has simply stressed Japan &apos;s need to be on an equal footing in alliance management with the US . 
Thus , the current US-Japanese estrangement is being driven by a spiral of mistrust that does not stem from geo-strategic concerns . 
Rather , Japan has initiated a series of abrupt policy changes , while the US , only dimly aware of the significance of its relative decline , assumes that Japan &apos;s decades-long docility will continue . 
Flaws in the transition between Japanese governments are also to blame . 
Hatoyama &apos;s ministers did not ask their counterparts in the departing administration of former Prime Minister Taro Aso to inform them fully about existing and potential foreign-policy problems . 
Nor did the Aso government &apos;s members , stupefied by their crushing electoral defeat , offer to do so . 
The relocation of the Marine Corps base - an issue burdened by the competing imperatives of Hatoyama &apos;s coalition government , American military strategy , and local anti-base politics on the island of Okinawa - is now a focal point of tensions with the US . 
The base agreement is essential for maintaining the political and strategic viability of the bilateral alliance . 
Yet , during the DPJ &apos;s election campaign , Hatoyama vowed to eliminate the Marines &quot; presence on Okinawa . 
To make matters worse , the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) has threatened to leave the government coalition if Hatoyama breaks his promise - a move that would deny the DPJ a simple majority in the Diet &apos;s upper house . 
Thus , Hatoyama is forced to subordinate Japan &apos;s alliance with the US to his government &apos;s survival , at least until next summer &apos;s upper-house elections . 
By then , the government will have enacted more of its legislative program , potentially enabling the DPJ to gain seats . 
Hatoyama cannot please everyone all the time , least of all the US . 
While he has repeatedly emphasized Japan &apos;s equal footing with the US in alliance management , this does not extend to Japan &apos;s military capability and defense burden . 
Obviously , he intends to keep asymmetrical reciprocity embedded in the bilateral mutual security treaty : the US defends Japan , and Japan leases to the US many large bases that are essential to its global military posture . 
Moreover , he evidently believes that the geo-strategic value of the bases enable him to bargain for a major US compromise . 
If this approach does not work , and if the existing Marine base on Okinawa remains , Hatoyama can pass the buck to the US , thereby deflecting anti-base pressure from local residents . 
He would also retain the current Marine Corps presence as a tripwire for US military intervention in the case of a flare-up across the Taiwan Strait , whereas Guam is beyond the effective range of Chinese ballistic missiles . 
Hatoyama is certainly a clever political tactician , but that is not sufficient to make him a wise leader . 
Above all , he must not play with fire : the US-Japan alliance is a public good that is indispensable for the peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region .
