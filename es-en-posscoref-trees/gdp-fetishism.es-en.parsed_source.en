GDP Fetishism 
NEW YORK - Striving to revive the world economy while simultaneously responding to the global climate crisis has raised a knotty question : are statistics giving us the right &quot; signals &quot; about what to do ? 
In our performance-oriented world , measurement issues have taken on increased importance : what we measure affects what we do . 
If we have poor measures , what we strive to do ( say , increase GDP ) may actually contribute to a worsening of living standards . 
We may also be confronted with false choices , seeing trade-offs between output and environmental protection that don &apos;t exist . 
By contrast , a better measure of economic performance might show that steps taken to improve the environment are good for the economy . 
Eighteen months ago , French President Nicolas Sarkozy established an international Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress , owing to his dissatisfaction - and that of many others - with the current state of statistical information about the economy and society . 
On September 14 , the Commission will issue its long-awaited report . 
The big question concerns whether GDP provides a good measure of living standards . 
In many cases , GDP statistics seem to suggest that the economy is doing far better than most citizens &quot; own perceptions . 
Moreover , the focus on GDP creates conflicts : political leaders are told to maximize it , but citizens also demand that attention be paid to enhancing security , reducing air , water , and noise pollution , and so forth - all of which might lower GDP growth . 
The fact that GDP may be a poor measure of well-being , or even of market activity , has , of course , long been recognized . 
But changes in society and the economy may have heightened the problems , at the same time that advances in economics and statistical techniques may have provided opportunities to improve our metrics . 
For example , while GDP is supposed to measure the value of output of goods and services , in one key sector - government - we typically have no way of doing it , so we often measure the output simply by the inputs . 
If government spends more - even if inefficiently - output goes up . 
In the last 60 y ears , the share of government output in GDP has increased from 21.4 % to 38.6 % in the US , from 27.6 % to 52.7 % in France , from 34.2 % to 47.6 % in the United Kingdom , and from 30.4 % to 44.0 % in Germany . 
So what was a relatively minor problem has now become a major one . 
Likewise , quality improvements - say , better cars rather than just more cars - account for much of the increase in GDP nowadays . 
But assessing quality improvements is difficult . 
Health care exemplifies this problem : much of medicine is publicly provided , and much of the advances are in quality . 
The same problems in making comparisons over time apply to comparisons across countries . 
The United States spends more on health care than any other country ( both per capita and as a percentage of income ) , but gets poorer outcomes . 
Part of the difference between GDP per capita in the US and some European countries may thus be a result of the way we measure things . 
Another marked change in most societies is an increase in inequality . 
This means that there is increasing disparity between average ( mean ) income and the median income ( that of the &quot; typical &quot; person , whose income lies in the middle of the distribution of all incomes ) . 
If a few bankers get much richer , average income can go up , even as most individuals &quot; incomes are declining . 
So GDP per capita statistics may not reflect what is happening to most citizens . 
We use market prices to value goods and services . 
But now , even those with the most faith in markets question reliance on market prices , as they argue against mark-to-market valuations . 
The pre-crisis profits of banks - one-third of all corporate profits - appear to have been a mirage . 
This realization casts a new light not only on our measures of performance , but also on the inferences we make . 
Before the crisis , when US growth ( using standard GDP measures ) seemed so much stronger than that of Europe , many Europeans argued that Europe should adopt US-style capitalism . 
Of course , anyone who wanted to could have seen American households &quot; growing indebtedness , which would have gone a long way toward correcting the false impression of success given by the GDP statistic . 
Recent methodological advances have enabled us to assess better what contributes to citizens &quot; sense of well-being , and to gather the data needed to make such assessments on a regular basis . 
These studies , for instance , verify and quantify what should be obvious : the loss of a job has a greater impact than can be accounted for just by the loss of income . 
They also demonstrate the importance of social connectedness . 
Any good measure of how well we are doing must also take account of sustainability . 
Just as a firm needs to measure the depreciation of its capital , so , too , our national accounts need to reflect the depletion of natural resources and the degradation of our environment . 
Statistical frameworks are intended to summarize what is going on in our complex society in a few easily interpretable numbers . 
It should have been obvious that one couldn &apos;t reduce everything to a single number , GDP . 
The report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress will , one hopes , lead to a better understanding of the uses , and abuses , of that statistic . 
The report should also provide guidance for creating a broader set of indicators that more accurately capture both well-being and sustainability ; and it should provide impetus for improving the ability of GDP and related statistics to assess the performance of the economy and society . 
Such reforms will help us direct our efforts ( and resources ) in ways that lead to improvement in both .
