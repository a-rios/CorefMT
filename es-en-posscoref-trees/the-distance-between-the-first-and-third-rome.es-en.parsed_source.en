The Distance Between the First and Third Rome 
MOSCOW / ROME : For a decade , Pope John Paul II has been flying in circles around Mother Russia : one day he visits the Baltics or his homeland of Poland ; the next , Orthodox Romania and Georgia . 
In June , 2001 Pope John Paul II will visit Ukraine and Armenia , both parts of the former Soviet Union and both still watched over warily by Russia &apos;s Orthodox Church . 
Karol Wojtyla , the first Slavic Pope in history , has long dreamed of visiting Moscow ; indeed he may see such a visit as putting the finishing touch on his long , turbulent pontificate . 
But , a decade after communism &apos;s collapse , it is Russia &apos;s churchmen , not its politicians , who are blocking the way . 
From Khrushchev onward , Moscow &apos;s rulers eyed the Vatican suspiciously but not without interest . 
Kremlin leaders instinctively understood the benefits of normalising relations with the Holy See for Soviet propaganda and foreign policy , and meetings between the Pope and Andrei Gromyko and Nikolai Podgorny did take place . 
Not until 1989 , however , did Mikhail Gorbachev dare establish official relations with the Vatican , inviting Pope John Paul II to visit the Soviet Union . 
Boris Yeltsin repeated the invitation in 1991 , and Vladimir Putin did the same on his visit to Rome soon after his inauguration as Russia &apos;s president . 
No papal visit to Moscow has taken place , however , because Russia &apos;s Orthodox Church remains opposed . 
The Russian Orthodox attitude is voiced repeatedly by Patriarch Alexy II and his closest aides , including the Patriarchy &apos;s &quot; foreign minister , &quot; Metropolitan Kyrill . 
Before the announcement of the Papal visit to Ukraine , the Italian newspaper &quot; Corriera della Sera &quot; quoted Patriarch Alexy II as admitting that a papal visit was possible , but only if &quot; persecution &quot; of Russian Orthodoxy by Catholics in western Ukraine and proselytising by Catholic clergy on the &quot; canonic territory &quot; of the Russian Orthodox church came to an end . 
Although seemingly hardline , these two conditions are a step forward for the Patriarch from his notorious statement of a few years ago , when he said that a true Orthodox Christian must not even pick mushrooms in the same forest as a Catholic . 
The Soviet Union , the Communist Party of the USSR , and the KGB may have collapsed , but the Russian Orthodox Church still defends the sacred borders of the former Russian empire . 
Moreover , because almost half of the parishes overseen by the Moscow Patriarchate are abroad - in Ukraine , Belarus , Moldova , Central Asia and other regions - Patriarch Alexy II lays increasing stress on the global character of his church . 
Indeed , the Russian Church &apos;s archbishops presented their Patriarch a golden icon , one side of which depicted the Last Supper and the other a map of his vast canonical territory , to mark the tenth anniversary of his reign . 
Clearly , all the bows and plaintive &quot; mea culpas &quot; made by the Pope over the past year to mark the 2000th anniversary of the Birth of Christ , have not satisfied the Patriarch . 
So , sadly , the Pontiff &apos;s dream of stepping on Russian soil , a soil lavishly showered with the blood of martyrs , before what the Pope has called this terrible &quot; wolverine &quot; century comes to an end , may never come true . 
Opportunities for a meeting between the two church leaders still exist , of course . 
For example , in 2001 both the Catholic and Orthodox Easter will fall on the same day - 15 April - an extremely rare occurrence . 
What better pretext could there be for an ecumenical meeting ? 
But will the Patriarch seize the moment ? 
The wounds between the two churches would heal if left undisturbed . 
I will never forget how two old men - the Pope and 90-year old Academician Dmitry Likhachev - leafed through a rare book together with tears in their eyes . 
Likhachev was showing the Pope an album about the Solovetsy camp where Likhachev had been imprisoned for &quot; religious propaganda . &quot; 
The album contained photographs of the windows of the old monk &apos;s cells to which the Soviets had affixed bars ; for years these cells imprisoned Catholic clergymen , such as those arrested after State Prosecutor Nikolay Krylenko proclaimed the Catholic Church &quot; an enemy of the people &quot; in 1917 . 
No one in authority in Russia , however , has ever repented for crimes committed against the country &apos;s own people . 
The hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church , indeed , has not admitted the sins of its collaboration with the Soviet state . 
Such a &quot; mea culpa &quot; from Russia might also help begin to heal the wounds of the Catholic / Orthodox division . 
Rapprochement between Christians is today a moral and political imperative . 
The Pope made the first step in a meeting last spring with Patriarch Shenuda III of the Coptic Orthodox Church during the Pope &apos;s visit to the Holy land . 
John Paul II hinted , daringly , at the possibility of revising the thousand-year old principle of the Bishop of Rome being first of the apostles and Christ &apos;s vicar on earth . 
Since 1054 , this idea has been a primary obstacle to Christian unity . 
According to the Kremlin press service , President Putin speaks to Patriarch Alexy II often . 
Perhaps he should explain to him that failure to pursue rapprochement with the Vatican contradicts Russia &apos;s state interests . 
As Russia &apos;s struggles to find a role and a voice in world diplomacy , having the Holy See as an ally would be beneficial . 
&quot; The tears of this century laid the ground for a new spring of the human spirit , &quot; the Pope declared in his last visit to the UN . 
Russia , as everyone knows , has suffered as much as , if not more than , any country . 
Sadly , as the title from one of Russia &apos;s most beloved movies of the communist era tells us , it still seems that &quot; Moscow ( or at least its Patriarch ) does not believe in tears . &quot;
