Europe &apos;s Competitiveness Shell Game 
BRUSSELS - For seasoned observers of Europe &apos;s economy , the most recent European Union summit delivered a bizarre sense of déjà vu . 
Little more than a decade ago , European leaders announced to great fanfare the &quot; Lisbon Agenda , &quot; a policy blueprint to make Europe &quot; the most competitive , knowledge-based economy in the world . &quot; 
The new &quot; Competitiveness Pact , &quot; proposed at the EU summit by France and Germany , did not make the same pretensions to global grandeur , but was instead sold as a step required to ensure the survival of the euro . 
With the exception of what appears to be a covert effort to force EU countries to raise corporate taxes to French and German levels , there is ostensibly nothing unreasonable in the Competitiveness Pact . 
Raising the retirement age to 67 , abolishing wage indexation , and compelling countries to enshrine a debt brake in their national constitutions are reasonable measures to enhance competitiveness and restore confidence in the euro . 
Unfortunately , however , government leaders have apparently learned nothing from the lessons of the failed Lisbon Agenda . 
Indeed , the current plans seem doomed to fail for two reasons . 
First , a credible policy agenda needs firm targets with clear deadlines . 
But , notwithstanding their leadership pose vis-à-vis the Competitiveness Pact , the French have already distanced themselves from the commitment to raise the retirement age to 67 . 
According to Bloomberg , a French official told reporters at the summit that there was no question of that after the retirement age was lifted to 62 from 60 last year . 
Given the huge public protests sparked by that move , the official &apos;s statement seems eminently believable . 
The likely outcome - in typical European , consensus-driven fashion - will be to forgo deadlines and concrete targets in favor of an ambiguous , open-ended pledge to undertake further pension reform . 
Similar exceptions will probably be made for other countries that cannot reconcile aspects of the new pact with their national circumstances . 
Belgium , for example , insists on its system of automatic wage indexing . 
After every country has received its &quot; opt-out , &quot; and the Competitiveness Pact &apos;s targets have been sufficiently diluted to ensure its passage , there will most likely be very little of substance left . 
Second , targets need to be not only specific , but also binding . 
Sanctions for non-compliance must be enforced - without political meddling . 
One of the most important lessons of the Lisbon Agenda is that the so-called Open Method of Coordination - a harmless peer-review procedure without repercussions for non-performance - is clearly the wrong approach to kick-starting national-level reforms . 
But even where the European Commission had the legislative tools and political mandate to impose sanctions - for example , to punish non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact - member states managed to avoid punishment by &quot; reforming &quot; the requirements . 
Indeed , Germany and France spearheaded the effort to make the Stability and Growth Pact more &quot; flexible &quot; when they could no longer comply with its 3 % -of-GDP fiscal-deficit ceiling . 
It is this history that makes the current moves to sideline the European Commission in enforcing the Competitiveness Pact suspicious . 
Organized purely as an intergovernmental policy program , the pact cannot work , because EU member states cannot be trusted to monitor their own performance and enforce sanctions on their peers - or on themselves . 
Such a system would be the political equivalent of letting the inmates guard the prison . 
In fact , the Competitiveness Pact &apos;s failure even to mention the Europe 2020 strategy , which EU leaders enacted less than a year ago as a blueprint for economic development , reinforces the impression of uncoordinated , ad hoc , and downright erratic policymaking that is heavy on theatrics and light on implementation . 
The lack of consensus on basic features of an economic framework - be it a retirement age commensurate with Europe &apos;s demographic outlook or a legislative commitment to budgetary discipline - makes one wonder how eurozone countries could enter a monetary union in the first place . 
That question is in the past , of course , but publicly demonstrating the eurozone &apos;s arrested convergence is bound to undermine confidence in the common currency further - and at a most unfortunate moment . 
Just as financial markets seem to have calmed , European leaders have once again raised expectations of a major policy move - only to see yet another summit devolve into squabbling . 
It is hard to imagine how Europe &apos;s policy differences can be overcome by the leaders &quot; self-imposed March deadline , when the next summit will take place . 
One thing is certain : it will require a lot more than a warmed-over Lisbon Agenda , with easy targets and toothless enforcement , to restore confidence in the euro and safeguard the monetary union .
