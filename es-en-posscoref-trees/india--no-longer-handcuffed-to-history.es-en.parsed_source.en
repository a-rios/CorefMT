India : No Longer Handcuffed to History 
NEW DELHI - A recent court ruling has revealed India &apos;s strengths and limitations as it grapples with its transformation from a land handcuffed to history-ever since the Partition of 1947 , which carved Pakistan out of its stooped shoulders - into a modern global giant . 
The High Court of India &apos;s most populous state , Uttar Pradesh , finally decided a 61-year-old suit over possession of a disputed site in the temple city of Ayodhya , where , in 1992 , a howling mob of Hindu extremists tore down the Babri Masjid mosque . 
The mosque was built in the 1520 &quot; s by India &apos;s first Mogul emperor , Babur , on a site traditionally believed to have been the birthplace of the Hindu god-king Ram , the hero of the 3,000-year-old epic , the Ramayana . 
The Hindu zealots who destroyed the mosque vowed to replace it with a temple to Ram , thereby avenging 500 years of history . 
India is a land where history , myth , and legend often overlap ; sometimes Indians cannot tell the difference . 
Many Hindus claim that the Babri Masjid stood on the precise spot of Ram &apos;s birth and had been placed there by Babur to remind a conquered people of their subjugation . 
But many historians - most of them Hindu - argue that there is no proof that Ram ever existed in human form , let alone that he was born where believers claim . 
More to the point , they argue , there is no proof that Babur demolished a Ram temple to build his mosque . 
Thus , to destroy the mosque and replace it with a temple was not righting an old wrong but perpetrating a new one . 
The Archaeological Survey of India , however , reported the existence of ruins beneath the demolished mosque that might have belonged to an ancient temple . 
The dispute remained intractable , and dragged interminably through the courts . 
To most Indian Muslims , the dispute is not about a specific mosque . 
The Babri Masjid had lain unused for a half-century before its destruction , as most of Ayodhya &apos;s Muslims had emigrated to Pakistan after Partition . 
Rather , the issue was their place in Indian society . 
For decades after independence , Indian governments guaranteed Muslims &quot; security in a secular state , permitting the retention of Islamic &quot; personal law &quot; separate from the country &apos;s civil code and even subsidizing pilgrimages to Mecca . 
Three of India &apos;s Presidents have been Muslim , as have been innumerable cabinet ministers , ambassadors , generals , and Supreme Court justices , not to mention cricket captains . 
Indeed , until at least the mid-1990 &quot; s , India &apos;s Muslim population was greater than that of Pakistan ( which has since pulled ahead , thanks to its soaring birthrate ) . 
For many years at the cusp of the new century , India &apos;s richest man ( the information-technology czar Azim Premji ) was a Muslim . 
The destruction of the mosque thus felt like an utter betrayal of the compact that had sustained the Muslim community as a vital part of India &apos;s pluralist democracy . 
But the Hindus who attacked the mosque had little faith in the institutions of Indian democracy . 
They view the state as soft , pandering to minorities out of misplaced Westernized secularism . 
To them , an independent India , freed after nearly 1,000 years of alien rule ( first Muslim , then British ) and rid of a sizable portion of its Muslim population by Partition , is obliged to embody and assert the triumphant indigenous identity of the 82 % of the population who consider themselves Hindu . 
These zealots are not fundamentalists in any common sense of the term , since Hinduism is a religion without fundamentals : there is no Hindu pope , no Hindu Sabbath , no single Hindu holy book , and no such thing as a Hindu heresy . 
Hindu &quot; fundamentalists &quot; are , instead , chauvinists , whose religious faith is rooted not in any of Hinduism &apos;s profound philosophical and spiritual underpinnings , but in its role as an alternative source of collective , if not &quot; national , &quot; identity . 
For them , Hinduism is a flag , not a doctrine . 
Indeed , these extremists can hardly claim to espouse Hinduism , which stands out not only as an eclectic embodiment of tolerance , but also as the only major religion that does not claim to be the sole true one . 
All ways of worship , Hinduism asserts , are valid , and religion is an intensely personal matter related to the individual &apos;s self-realization in relation to God . 
Such a faith understands that belief is a matter of hearts and minds , not of bricks and stone . 
The true Hindu seeks no revenge upon history , for he understands that history is its own revenge . 
The court judgment gives two-thirds of the disputed site to two Hindu organizations , and one-third to Muslims , which suggests a solution that might permit the construction of both a mosque and a temple on the same site . 
The court &apos;s decision thus is an affirmation of Indian pluralism and of the rule of law . 
What the court has done is to craft a solution that no political process could have arrived at independently , but which takes the dispute off the streets . 
Otherwise , the violence would continue , spawning new hostages to history - and ensuring that future generations would be taught new wrongs to set right . 
The judgment is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court by one side or the other . 
But it reminds the world that democratic India can overcome its most fundamental difficulties without violence or revolution . 
In so doing , it is clear that India is ready to leave behind the problems of the sixteenth century as it takes its place in the twenty-first .
