The Eurozone &apos;s Autumn Hangover 
NEW YORK - After a summer of Europeans forgetting their woes and tanning themselves at the beach , the time for a reality check has come . 
First , a trillion-dollar bailout package in May prevented an immediate default by Greece and a break-up of the eurozone . 
Second , a fudged set of financial &quot; stress tests &quot; sought to persuade markets that European banks &quot; needed only € 3.5 billion in fresh capital . 
Finally , a temporary acceleration of growth in the eurozone in the second quarter boosted financial markets and the euro , but it is now clear that the improvement was transitory . 
All of the eurozone &apos;s peripheral countries &quot; GDP is still either contracting ( Spain , Ireland , and Greece ) or barely growing ( Italy and Portugal ) . 
Even Germany &apos;s temporary success is riddled with caveats . 
During the 2008-2009 financial crisis , GDP fell much more in Germany - because of its dependence on collapsing global trade - than in the United States . 
A transitory rebound from such a hard fall is not surprising , and German output remains below pre-crisis levels . 
Moreover , all the factors that will lead to a slowdown of growth in most advanced economies in the second half of 2010 and 2011 are at work in Germany and the rest of the eurozone . 
Fiscal stimulus is turning into fiscal austerity and a drag on growth . 
The inventory adjustment that drove most of the GDP growth for a few quarters is complete , and tax policies that stole demand from the future ( &quot; cash for clunkers &quot; all over Europe , etc . ) have expired . 
The slowdown of global growth - and actual double-dip recession risks in the US and Japan - will invariably impede export growth , even in Germany . 
Indeed , the latest data from Germany - declining exports , falling factory orders , anemic industrial-production growth , and a slide in investors &quot; confidence - suggest that the slowdown has started . 
In the periphery , the trillion-dollar bailout package and the non-stressful &quot; stress tests &quot; kicked the can down the road , but the fundamental problems remain : large budget deficits and stocks of public debt that will be hard to reduce sufficiently , given weak governments and public backlash against fiscal austerity and structural reforms ; large current-account deficits and private-sector foreign liabilities that will be hard to rollover and service ; loss of competitiveness ( driven by a decade-long loss of market share in labor-intensive exports to emerging markets , rising unit labor costs , and the strength of the euro until 2008 ) ; low potential and actual growth ; and massive risks to banks and financial institutions ( with the exception of Italy ) . 
This is why Greece is insolvent and a coercive restructuring of its public debt is inevitable . 
As fiscal austerity means more recessionary and deflationary pressures in the short run , one would need more monetary stimulus to compensate and more domestic demand growth - via delayed fiscal austerity - in Germany . 
The rest of the eurozone is in barely better shape than the periphery : the bond vigilantes may not have woken up in France , but economic performance there has been anemic at best - driven mostly by a mini housing boom . 
Unemployment is above 9 % , the budget deficit is 8 % of GDP ( larger than Italy ) , and public debt is rising sharply . 
Nicolas Sarkozy came to power with lots of talk of structural reforms ; he is now weakened even within his own party and lost regional elections to the left ( the only case in Europe of a shift to the left in recent elections ) . 
Given that he will face a serious challenge from the Socialist Party candidate - most likely the formidable Dominique Strauss-Kahn - in the 2012 presidential election , Sarkozy is likely to postpone serious fiscal austerity and launch only cosmetic structural reforms . 
Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme , as current holder of the rotating EU presidency , now speaks of greater European policy unity and coordination . 
Even Angela Merkel - in growing Germany - has been weakened within her own coalition . 
Other eurozone leaders face stiff political opposition : Silvio Berlusconi in Italy , whom one hopes may soon be booted out of power ; 
José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero in Spain ; 
George Papandreou in Greece . 
And politics is becoming nationalistic and nativist in many parts of Europe , reflected in an anti-immigrant backlash ; raids against the Roma ; 
So a eurozone that needs fiscal austerity , structural reforms , and appropriate macroeconomic and financial policies is weakened politically at both the EU and national levels . 
That is why my best-case scenario is that the eurozone somehow muddles through in the next few years ; at worst ( and with a probability of more than one-third ) , the eurozone will break up , owing to a combination of sovereign debt restructurings and exits by some weaker economies .
