A No-Fly Zone for Libya 
WASHINGTON , DC - Leaders around the world are vigorously debating the advisability of establishing a no-fly zone to stop the violence unfolding in Libya . 
Some cite Bosnia , where NATO took too long to protect civilian populations in the mid-1990 &quot; s , as a reason to act . 
Others remember Rwanda , where President Bill Clinton later expressed regret for not acting to save innocent lives . 
But the stakes in Libya today are more appropriately underscored by the tragedy in southern Iraq in the waning days of the Persian Gulf War 20 years ago . 
As coalition forces were routing the Iraqi army in February 1991 , President George H.W. Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to &quot; take matters into their hands to force Saddam Hussein the dictator to step aside . &quot; 
When Iraqi Shiites , Kurds , and Marsh Arabs rebelled against Hussein , they believed that American forces would protect them against their brutal dictator &apos;s superior firepower . 
Instead , when Iraqi attack helicopters and elite troops began butchering their own people , coalition forces were ordered to stand down . 
The world watched as thousands of Iraqis were slaughtered . 
The situation in Libya today is not identical . 
Inspired by events in Tunisia and Egypt , the Libyan people rose up spontaneously against four decades of repression by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi . 
Still , the specter that haunts me is the same - ordinary people facing off against an autocrat &apos;s airpower and well-armed soldiers , counting on the free world to protect them against massacre after we have applauded and bolstered their bravery with our words . 
So far , Qaddafi &apos;s forces have relied on airpower selectively . 
But Qaddafi is shrewd . 
My fear is that he is either choosing to bleed the opposition to death , rather than invite global action with a broad massacre , or waiting for the world to prove itself unwilling to act - at which point he might well begin killing civilians in large numbers . 
We cannot wait for that to happen . 
We need to take concrete steps now so that we are prepared to implement a no-fly zone immediately if Qaddafi starts using his airpower to kill large numbers of civilians . 
Diplomacy is urgently needed to build broad support for a no-fly zone . 
The most important imprimatur should come from the United Nations , where debate should begin immediately over a resolution authorizing a no-fly zone . 
China and Russia have expressed reservations . 
If the Security Council fails to authorize action , those of us determined to protect Libyan civilians will face a more difficult choice should the violence escalate . 
So our diplomatic efforts must extend beyond the UN . 
The support of NATO and the African Union are important . 
To avoid the perception of NATO or the US attacking another Muslim country , the backing of the Arab world is also needed . 
On that front , there are promising signs . 
The six Arab countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council have called for a UN-imposed no-fly zone . 
The Arab League has endorsed a similar proposal . 
Muslim countries in particular should support preparations for intervention if the violence spirals out of control . 
Qaddafi cannot be allowed to think that he can massacre his people with impunity . 
If the UN cannot approve a resolution for implementing a no-fly zone , then the US and its allies in NATO and the Arab world must be prepared to prevent a massacre like the one that occurred in Srebrenica in 1995 , when more than 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were slaughtered . 
Of course , imposing a no-fly zone would not be a panacea . 
It probably would not tip the balance if the situation in Libya deteriorates into a full-scale civil war . 
But a no-fly zone would eliminate airstrikes and save civilian lives . 
It is a tool that we should be ready to use if the situation warrants it , and it would signal to the opposition that it is not alone . 
Before that decision is reached , the international community needs to provide humanitarian assistance and medical supplies to the rebels in eastern Libya . 
We must not allow them to be starved into submission . 
The one option that should not be on the table is US ground troops ; no one wants to see US forces bogged down in another war , especially in another Muslim country . 
And , as President Barack Obama has said , the Libyan people must not be deprived of full ownership of their struggle for freedom , and Qaddafi must not be given a useful foil and scapegoat . 
Perhaps the mere threat of a no-fly zone will keep Qaddafi &apos;s pilots from using their helicopters and fighter jets to kill their own people . 
If it does not , we should make clear that we will lead the free world to avoid the senseless slaughter of any more Libyan citizens by a madman bent on maintaining power . 
The US and the world community should also make clear - as we did in Bosnia and Kosovo - that we are taking a united stand against a thug who is killing Muslims .
