The Hamas Veto 
GAZA CITY - The resumption of direct peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis has broken 20 months of stalemate , and marked the entry of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu into this round of diplomacy . 
But these difficult talks face significant challenges from outside the negotiating room , particularly from Hamas , which is intent on ensuring that nothing happens without its approval . 
Hamas refuses all direct peace negotiations with Israel , and has vowed to derail the current talks through violence . 
Their first blow came on the eve of the talks , when the al-Qassam Brigades , Hamas &quot; military wing , carried out an ambush on Israeli settlers in Hebron , killing four people . 
Hamas has vowed to continue launching its attacks from inside the West Bank , but not from Gaza . 
Israel does not recognize a distinction between Hamas-planned attacks from the West Bank and from Gaza . 
However , a large-scale Israeli assault on Hamas &apos;s Gaza redoubt in response to the West Bank killings could bring the negotiations to a halt . 
Hamas &apos;s strategy is to expose the Palestinian Authority &apos;s weakness by demonstrating that it cannot control the West Bank , as it promises in negotiations . 
Moreover , Hamas is well aware that their attacks cause Israel to insist even more strongly on security as the centerpiece of any agreement . 
This , in turn , puts the spotlight on ongoing security cooperation between Israel , the PA , and the United States , again undermining the PA &apos;s claims to represent the Palestinian people . 
Rhetoric aside , Hamas &apos;s opposition to direct talks with Israel is intended to make clear to the US that Hamas is central to the political reality of the region and cannot be ignored . 
If Hamas is not part of the process , there will be no process . 
Hamas insists that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas does not have the legitimacy to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians , and that any deal he reaches with Israel is not binding . 
Hamas claims to be the Palestinians &quot; true representative , having won the majority of seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council ( PLC ) in January 2006 ( the PLC &apos;s term expired in January 2010 , but fresh elections have yet to be held ) . 
As Hamas knows , the US holds the key to ending the political isolation imposed on it after its victory in 2006 . 
Indeed , Hamas leaders recently acknowledged sending messages to the Obama administration calling for dialogue . 
The most recent note , sent through a group of visiting American academics , asked the US government to take a more balanced position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
Hamas , for its part , has expressed its willingness to accept a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza , subject to a return of all refugees and Israel &apos;s release of all Palestinian prisoners . 
But Hamas has not taken what the US considers the critical step of recognizing Israel - and thus accepting a two-state solution . 
For now , Hamas and the Palestinians of Gaza are excluded from the peace talks , which means that the negotiations will most likely not lead to an end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict . 
But every day that Gazans are left to stew in an unhealthy mix of siege , poverty , and unemployment is a day that strengthens the Hamas hardliners . 
The US has invested much in shuttle diplomacy to bring Netanyahu and Abbas to the negotiating table and is not ready to see these talks collapse . 
What do they have to lose ? 
The future of these direct peace talks thus depends not only on Netanyahu and Abbas , but also on how they relate to the extremists within their camps . 
Will Netanyahu abandon his ideological rhetoric , negotiate seriously with the Palestinians , and make the needed concessions ? 
Can the Palestinians rise to the political moment and take advantage of the pressure coming from US President Barack Obama ? 
The stakes are high , and failure would be costly to Americans , Israelis , and Palestinians . 
If the talks collapse , US foreign policy in the Middle East would be further discredited , and nothing would remain to keep the parties from launching another round of conflict . 
For Palestinians , this is likely to be Abbas &apos;s last chance . 
He is wagering his scant remaining authority on the talks &quot; success , and Palestinians will be counting down his days in office should he fail . 
For Netanyahu , perhaps maintaining the status quo will be seen as a victory , at least in the short term . 
But Israel &apos;s margin for strategic error will shrink even further . 
Meanwhile , Hamas bides its time . 
A failure of Palestinian-Israeli talks would only prove Hamas &apos;s basic point : nothing moves forward without us .
