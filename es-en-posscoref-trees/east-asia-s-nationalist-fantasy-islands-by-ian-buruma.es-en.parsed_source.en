East Asia &apos;s Nationalist Fantasy Islands 
TOKYO - They don &apos;t look like much , those few uninhabited rocks in the East China Sea between Okinawa and Taiwan , and a couple of tiny islets in the Sea of Japan , inhabited by a few token fishermen and some South Korean Coast Guard officials . 
The former , called the Senkaku Islands in Japan , and the Diaoyu Islands in China , are claimed by China , Japan , and Taiwan ; the latter , called Takeshima in Japan , and Dokdo in Korea , are claimed by South Korea and Japan . 
These tiny outcroppings have little material value , and yet the dispute over their ownership has led to a major international dustup . 
There has even been talk of military action . 
The historical facts actually appear quite simple . 
Japan grabbed the islands as part of its empire-building project after the Sino-Japanese war in 1895 and the annexation of Korea in 1905 . 
Prior sovereignty is unclear ; there were fishermen from Japan in Takeshima / Dokdo , and some awareness of the Senkaku / Diaoyu in imperial China . 
But no formal claims were made by any state . 
Things became more complicated after World War II . 
Japan was supposed to return its colonial possessions , but the United States took over the Senkaku Islands along with Okinawa , before returning both to Japan in 1972 . 
The Koreans , still enraged at Japan for almost a half-century of colonization , took the Dokdo islands without worrying about the move &apos;s legality . 
Given the brutality of the Japanese occupations of Korea and China , one is naturally inclined to sympathize with Japan &apos;s former victims . 
The fiery emotions inspired by this dispute - some Koreans even mutilated themselves in protest against Japan - suggest that the wounds of the Japanese war in Asia are still fresh . 
Indeed , South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has used the occasion to demand a formal apology for the war from the Japanese emperor , and financial compensation for Korean women who were forced to serve Japanese soldiers in military brothels during the war . 
Unfortunately , the Japanese government , despite much circumstantial and even documentary evidence supplied by Japanese historians , now chooses to deny the wartime regime &apos;s responsibility for this ghastly project . 
Not surprisingly , that stance has further inflamed Korean emotions . 
And yet it would be too simple to ascribe the current dispute entirely to the open wounds of the last world war . 
Nationalist feelings , deliberately stirred up in China , Korea , and Japan , are linked to recent history , to be sure , but the politics behind them is different in each country . 
Since the press in all three countries is almost autistic in its refusal to reflect anything but the &quot; national &quot; point of view , these politics are never properly explained . 
The Communist government in China can no longer derive any legitimacy from Marxist , let alone Maoist , ideology . 
Since the 1990 &quot; s , therefore , nationalism has replaced Communism as the justification for the one-party state , which requires stirring up anti-Western - above all , anti-Japanese - sentiment . 
This is never difficult in China , given the painful past , and it usefully deflects public attention from the failings and frustrations of living in a dictatorship . 
In South Korea , one of the most painful legacies of the Japanese colonial period stems from the Korean elite &apos;s widespread collaboration at the time . 
Their offspring still play an important part in conservative politics in the country , which is why Korean leftists periodically call for purges and retribution . 
President Lee is a conservative , and relatively pro-Japanese . 
But , precisely because Lee is regarded as a pro-Japanese conservative , he needs to burnish his nationalist credentials . 
His political opponents are not the Japanese , but the Korean left . 
The use of the war to stoke anti-Japanese feelings in China and Korea is annoying to the Japanese , and triggers defensive reactions . 
But Japanese nationalism is also fed by anxieties and frustrations - specifically , fear of rising Chinese power and Japan &apos;s total dependency on the US for its national security . 
Japanese conservatives view their country &apos;s post-war pacifist constitution , written by Americans in 1946 , as a humiliating assault on Japanese sovereignty . 
Now that China is testing its growing power by claiming territories , not just in the East China Sea , but also in the South China Sea , Japanese nationalists insist that Japan must act as a big power , and be seen as a serious player , fully prepared to defend its sovereignty , even over a few insignificant rocks . 
China , Korea , and Japan , whose economic interests are closely entwined , have every reason to avoid a serious conflict . 
For entirely domestic reasons , each country is manipulating the history of a devastating war , triggering passions that can only cause more damage . 
Politicians , commentators , activists , and journalists in each country are talking endlessly about the past . 
But they are manipulating memories for political ends .
