Women on Top ? 
What will G-8 summit meetings be like when American President Hillary Clinton and French President Ségolène Royal join German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a formidable triangle of women &apos;s power ? 
The scenario is not altogether unlikely . 
Indeed , in the United States and France , there are even alternative female candidates for the presidency ( Condoleezza Rice in America , Michelle Alliot-Marie in France ) . 
Will this mean a new style of both domestic politics and international relations ? 
The answer is not obvious . 
After all , some women have long had the strength and the will to make it to the top . 
Think of Indira Gandhi , Golda Meir , or Margaret Thatcher . 
All three were powerful prime ministers of their countries , though perhaps not the epitome of what might be regarded as feminine values . 
They all outdid men at their own game and had little time for what came to be called feminism . 
Indeed , another trend may be more significant as far as political leadership is concerned . 
When it comes to the formation of governments , women have managed to break out of the prison of their traditional domains , such as education and social affairs . 
Foreign policy in particular has become a female aspiration . 
Both the US and the European Union have women leading their foreign offices ; so do half a dozen EU countries , including Britain . 
Has this changed the style , indeed , the substance of foreign policy ? 
Undoubtedly , a shift in policy styles is occurring in many parts of the world . 
In a word , it appears that the Reagan-Thatcher period is over . 
While opponents of globalization still fight &quot; neo-liberal &quot; policies , political discourse has taken a new turn . 
Words like &quot; justice &quot; are back in fashion ; there is concern about globalization &apos;s losers and the &quot; underclass . &quot; 
Likewise , the leader of Britain &apos;s Conservatives , David Cameron , startled more old-fashioned supporters of his party by saying that people released from prison &quot; need , above all , love . &quot; 
When Prime Minister Tony Blair described the next election as a fistfight in which the &quot; flyweight &quot; Cameron would be carried out and the &quot; heavyweight &quot; Brown victorious after a short bout , he got much applause from his supporters in the House of Commons , but the remark went down badly with voters . 
Somehow , people prefer &quot; softer &quot; values than were prevalent in the last two decades . 
Yet it is not the leading women who above all represent these values . 
Merkel may have been softened by having to preside over a grand coalition , but her original stance was more of the Reagan-Thatcher variety . 
Yuliya Tymoshenko was clearly the most stouthearted among the leaders of Ukraine &apos;s Orange Revolution , and no one has ever described Hillary Clinton as particularly &quot; soft . &quot; 
On the contrary , her possible Republican opponent in 2009 , Senator John McCain , while a war hero , is also a man who represents to many Americans the new soft values . 
Merkel had a difficult time in the run-up to her recent party conference , because Jürgen Rüttgers , the minister-president of the largest German state , North-Rhine Westphalia , reminded the Christian Democrats of their historical support for strong social-welfare policies . 
Only Royal may be said to represent softer lines against the hard-liner of the governing party , Nicolas Sarkozy . 
So , have women at or near the top made no real difference to politics ? 
Whatever change they have brought has not been obvious . 
In a sense , women &apos;s advance is simply the normal consequence of the gradual move to effective equality of opportunity that began in the 1960 &quot; s . 
It took decades to become real , and there are still countries that have a long way to go . 
Despite Tymoshenko &apos;s leading role in Ukraine , it would be surprising to see Russian President Vladimir Putin replaced by a woman , and , while there is a female vice-president in China , there is no sign of a woman becoming Japanese prime minister soon . 
Even so , in many parts of the world , women have made considerable headway on the path to the top . 
Not infrequently this has been helped by explicit policies . 
David Cameron prides himself on a successful campaign to make 40 % of all Conservative parliamentary candidates in Britain are women . 
But this is precisely the point . 
It is not the women at the top who have changed the scene . 
Rather , it is a more general trend , helped along by open-minded leaders of both sexes , that has changed the political climate in countries . 
No one , man or woman , can today aspire to setting the tone of public discourse without recognizing that politics is no longer only a man &apos;s game . 
In other words , normalization by equal opportunity is itself the change . 
Whatever the particular values of leading candidates , this is undoubtedly progress .
