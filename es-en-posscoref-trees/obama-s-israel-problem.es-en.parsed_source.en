Obama &apos;s Israel Problem 
NEW YORK - On a rare foray outside his native Texas , Governor Rick Perry accused US President Barack Obama of &quot; appeasement &quot; towards the Palestinians . 
Former New York City Mayor Edward Koch supported a Catholic Republican congressional candidate against a Jewish Democrat in New York , because the Republican supports Israel through thick and thin - and because Obama had voiced reservations about Israel &apos;s expansion of settlements on the West Bank . 
In Koch &apos;s words , Obama &quot; threw Israel under the bus . &quot; 
The Republican won . 
Meanwhile , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , who is rather sensitive about foreigners meddling in domestic Israeli politics , has been openly and consistently courting congressional Republicans by attacking Obama . 
And Obama &apos;s response ? 
A speech at the United Nations , reiterating his support for Israel , his understanding of Israel &apos;s fears and vulnerability , with barely a mention of Palestinian fears and vulnerability . 
What is it about Israel that reduces America &apos;s president to Jell-O ? 
Why , for that matter , are all American politicians so afraid to be critical of Israeli policies ? 
Is it fear of being called an anti-Semite ? 
Or is it the &quot; Jewish vote &quot; ? 
On the face of it , Democrats don &apos;t have that much to fear . 
Polls suggest that a majority of Jewish Americans ( a mere 1.7 % of the US population ) still vote for the Democratic Party . 
When it comes to the so-called Israel lobby in Washington , which is well organized and very well funded , evangelical Christians play an important part as well . 
But they vote overwhelmingly for Republicans , so Obama would not seem to have much to lose there . 
True , certain pro-Israeli organizations , notably the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , can generate a great deal of money to make or break political candidates , who are judged solely on their attitudes towards Israel . 
And money , given or withdrawn , as well as Jews refusing to vote for Obama out of pique , could make all the difference in crucial &quot; swing states &quot; such as Florida . 
Cash , voters , and lobbies aside , something fundamental has changed in recent years , and this scares the Democrats : Israel &apos;s conflict with Palestine is now being used by the American right as a cudgel to beat up liberals . 
This was not true before . 
In the first few decades of its modern existence , when it was largely run by socialists , Israel was mainly supported by the world &apos;s liberal left . 
In fact , the last US administration to be somewhat tough on the Israeli government was that of the Republican George H.W. Bush . 
Jews , in both Europe and the US , traditionally tended to lean towards the left . 
Right-wing politics , especially when based on ethnic nationalism , are rarely good for minorities , who fare better in a more open , cosmopolitan environment . 
Jews were among the most ardent supporters of black Americans &quot; struggle for civil rights in the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s . 
As long as Israel was a liberal state , it was easy , even natural , for most American Jews to support it . 
There was no conflict between the head and the heart , between an emotional attachment to Israel and a political commitment to liberal causes . 
But things began to change when the Israeli Labor Party lost ground to the harder-line Likud . 
More and more , Israel began to be infected by precisely the type of politics most Jews have traditionally feared , especially ethnic nationalism . 
Provoked , in part , by Arab neighbors &quot; hostility and Palestinian leaders &quot; intransigence , Israel began to turn sharply to the right . 
This was also the result of demographic changes : Middle Eastern Jews were more viscerally anti-Arab than their European brethren , and Jewish immigrants from Russia were viscerally anti-left . 
Moreover , the number of Orthodox Jews continued to grow apace . 
As a result , the European liberal left lost its sympathy for Israel , and the country acquired a new set of friends among the right - even the far right . 
European right-wing populists , including some who represent parties with a strong anti-Semitic past , now proudly proclaim their support for Israeli settlers on Palestinian land . 
And , in the US , a peculiar alliance of Jewish hardliners and evangelical Christians , who believe that all Jews must eventually return to the Holy Land and convert to Christianity , has become the main base of support for Israel . 
This has created a very odd situation . 
Right-wing politicians from the American South , together with Austrian , German , French , and Dutch populists , are accusing liberals of appeasing &quot; Islamofascism . &quot; 
These political heirs of deeply racist traditions are the new champions of a Jewish state , whose policies now owe more to nineteenth-century ethnic chauvinism than to Zionism &apos;s socialist roots . 
Pandering to Israel &apos;s uncompromising policies may be the easiest way for America &apos;s Democratic president to avoid trouble in an election year . 
Obama certainly needs all the friends he can get . 
But the price will be high . 
Forced to back Israel , right or wrong , the US is quickly losing credibility and influence in a turbulent Middle East . 
Putting pressure on Israel to stop building settlements and come to terms with a viable Palestinian state will be very difficult . 
But it is the only way to break the constant cycle of violence . 
Standing up to Israel , and its new fanatical friends , is not anti-Jewish . 
On the contrary , it is to uphold the liberal tradition in which many Jews continue to believe .
