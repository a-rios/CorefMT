Unblocking Corporate Governance Reform 
CAMBRIDGE - When they met earlier this month , G-20 finance ministers and central bankers called for global improvements in corporate governance . 
Such appeals are often heard , but powerful vested interests make it hard for governments to follow through . 
So , if serious reforms are to be implemented , strong and persistent public pressure will be needed . 
Many countries provide investors in publicly traded firms with levels of protection that are patently inadequate . 
Even in countries with well-developed systems of corporate governance , arrangements that are excessively lax on corporate insiders persist . 
In the United States , for example , insiders enjoy protections from takeovers that , according to a substantial body of empirical evidence , actually decrease company value . 
Lax corporate governance rules are not generally the result of a lack of knowledge by public officials . 
Political impediments often enable lax arrangements to linger even after they are recognized as inefficient . 
Ordinarily , corporate governance issues are not followed by most citizens . 
As a result , politicians expect that their decisions on investor protection will have little direct effect on citizens &quot; voting decisions . 
By contrast , interest groups with big stakes in the rules follow corporate governance issues closely , and they lobby politicians to get favorable regulations . 
The group that , in normal times , can be expected to have the most influence is that which consists of insiders within publicly-traded companies . 
Corporate insiders are an especially powerful lobbying group because of their ability to use some of the resources of the companies under their control . 
They have the power to direct their firms &quot; campaign contributions , to offer positions or business to politicians &quot; relatives or associates ( or to politicians upon retirement ) , and to use their businesses to support issues and causes that politicians seek to advance . 
Because insiders gain the full benefits that arise through lobbying for lax corporate governance rules , while their firms bear most of the costs of such lobbying , insiders have an advantage in the competition for influence over politicians . 
Their lobbying , which is carried out at the expense of their companies , is subsidized by their shareholders . 
While individual investors cannot be expected to invest in lobbying for stronger investor protection , it might be hoped that institutional investors - mutual funds , banks , insurance companies , and so forth - will do so . 
Institutional investors receive funds from individuals and invest them in publicly traded companies . 
Because institutional investors invest substantial amounts in such companies , they should be well informed about corporate governance issues . 
But institutional investors usually do not provide a sufficient counter-weight to lobbying by corporate insiders . 
In contrast to corporate insiders , institutional investors cannot charge the costs of lobbying to the publicly traded companies whose investor protection is at stake . 
In addition , depending on their relationship with their own investors , some institutional investors ( for example , mutual fund managers ) may capture only a limited fraction of the increase in value of their portfolios as a result of governance reforms . 
This reduces the willingness of institutional investors to invest in counteracting insider lobbying . 
Moreover , those who make decisions for institutional investors often have interests that discourage lobbying for stronger constraints on corporate insiders . 
Some institutional investors are part of publicly traded firms , and are consequently under the control of corporate insiders whose interests are not served by new constraints . 
And even those institutional investors that are not affiliated with publicly traded companies may have an interest in getting business from such companies , making these institutional investors reluctant to push for reforms that corporate insiders oppose . 
So , interest-group politics commonly produce substantial obstacles to reform of corporate governance . 
However , some events - such as a wave of corporate scandals or a stock market crash - can interrupt the ordinary pro-insider operations of interest-group politics by leading ordinary citizens to pay attention corporate governance failures . 
When citizens become so outraged that their voting decisions may be affected by politicians &quot; failure to improve investor protection , public demand for governance reform can overcome the power of vested interests . 
Indeed , most major governance reforms occur in such circumstances . 
In the US , for example , new securities laws were passed following the stock market crash of 1929 , and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was adopted in 2002 , in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Internet bubble and the Enron and WorldCom scandals . 
By creating a large public demand for reforms , the current crisis offers another opportunity to improve governance arrangements . 
This opportunity should not be missed .
