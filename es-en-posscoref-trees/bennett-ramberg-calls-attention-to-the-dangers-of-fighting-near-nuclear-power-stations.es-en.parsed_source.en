The Chernobyl Factor in the Ukraine Crisis 
LOS ANGELES - Twenty-eight years after its Chernobyl nuclear plant exploded , Ukraine confronts a nuclear specter of a different kind : the possibility that the country &apos;s reactors could become military targets in the event of a Russian invasion . 
Speaking at the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague in March , Andrii Deshchytsia , Ukraine &apos;s acting foreign minister , cited the &quot; potential threat to many nuclear facilities &quot; should events deteriorate into open warfare . 
Earlier in the month , Ihor Prokopchuk , Ukraine &apos;s ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency , circulated a letter to the organization &apos;s board of governors warning that an invasion could bring a &quot; threat of radiation contamination on the territory of Ukraine and the territory of neighboring states . &quot; 
In Kyiv , Ukraine &apos;s parliament responded by calling for international monitors to help protect the plants as the cash-strapped government attempts to boost its own efforts . 
Are Ukraine &apos;s concerns mere hyperbole - a &quot; malicious slander , &quot; as the Kremlin puts it - or should we take them seriously ? 
For Ukraine &apos;s government , the angst is real . 
Even Ukrainians born after 1986 understand what a Chernobyl-type disaster brought about by battle could look like . 
History offers little guidance as to whether warring countries would avoid damaging nuclear sites . 
With the exception of the 1990 &quot; s Balkan conflict , wars have not been fought against or within countries with nuclear reactors . 
In the case of the Balkans , Serbian military jets overflew Slovenia &apos;s Kr≈°ko nuclear power plant in a threatening gesture early in the conflict , while radical Serbian nationalists called for attacks to release the radioactive contents . 
Serbia itself later issued a plea to NATO not to bomb its large research reactor in Belgrade . 
Fortunately , the war ended with both reactors untouched . 
While that case provides some assurance that military and political leaders will think twice about attacking nuclear reactors , the sheer scale of Ukraine &apos;s nuclear enterprise calls for far greater global concern . 
Today , 15 aging plants provide 40 % of Ukraine &apos;s electricity . 
( Ukraine shut several reactors operating adjacent to the damaged Chernobyl reactor years ago . ) 
Concentrated in four locations , Ukraine &apos;s pressurized water reactors differ from the less stable Chernobyl RBMK design , yet still remain capable of releasing radioactive contents should safeguards fail . 
Given that Russia , too , suffered serious consequences from the Chernobyl accident , it is to be hoped that the Kremlin would recoil at the idea of bombing the plants intentionally . 
But warfare is rife with accidents and human error , and such an event involving a nuclear plant could cause a meltdown . 
A loss of off-site power , for example , could be an issue of serious concern . 
Although nuclear plants are copious producers of electricity , they also require electrical power from other sources to operate . 
Without incoming energy , cooling pumps will cease functioning and the flow of water that carries heat away from the reactor core - required even when the reactor is in shutdown mode - will stop . 
To meet that risk , nuclear plants maintain large emergency diesel generators , which can operate for days - until their fuel runs out . 
The reactor meltdowns at Japan &apos;s Fukushima Daiichi power station in 2011 demonstrated what happens when primary and emergency operating power are cut . 
Such vulnerabilities raise troubling questions in the event of a war . 
Fighting could disrupt off-site power plants or transmission lines servicing the reactor , and could also prevent diesel fuel from reaching the plant to replenish standby generators . 
Operators could abandon their posts should violence encroach . 
Moreover , combatants could invade nuclear plants and threaten sabotage to release radioactive elements to intimidate their opponents . 
Others might take refuge there , creating a dangerous standoff . 
A failure of military command and control or the fog of war could bring plants under bombardment . 
Serious radiological contamination could result in each of these scenarios . 
And , though no one stands to gain from a radioactive release , if war breaks out , we must anticipate the unexpected . 
In Ukraine , nuclear emissions could exceed both Chernobyl and Fukushima . 
Wartime conditions would prevent emergency crews from getting to an affected plant to contain radiological releases should reactor containments fail . 
And , with government services shut down in the midst of fighting , civilians attempting to escape radioactive contamination would not know what to do or where to go to protect themselves . 
Such risks might be one reason for Russian President Vladimir Putin to think twice about ordering a military invasion of Ukraine . 
But , should war come , combatants must do all they can to keep conflict away from the nuclear sites and the off-site power sources feeding them . 
Plant operators should stockpile diesel fuel to keep emergency generators operating . 
They should perform review and maintenance of generators to ensure that they are set to go . 
In the event of fighting near reactors , the West should prepare to ferry forces to secure the plants and keep the generators operating ; and , in the event of a meltdown , the West should rally both governments to initiate a cease-fire to deal with the disaster . 
Given the stakes , failure to prepare for the worst is not an option .
