Post-Uribe Colombia 
BUENOS AIRES - Colombia &apos;s presidential election at the end of May will be unique in many ways . 
Álvaro Uribe &apos;s plans for a third term were dashed in March by the Constitutional Court , which , despite massive pressure , upheld the constitutional prohibition on serving more than two consecutive terms . 
Uribe &apos;s absence has opened the election in unforeseen ways . 
Although Uribe is now technically a &quot; lame duck &quot; president , he does retain considerable influence , and is trying hard to keep the issue of internal security - the central focus of his presidency - at the heart of the electoral battle . 
He has also sought to benefit from ratcheting up tensions with neighboring Venezuela , and counts on his dauphin , former Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos , to unite the country &apos;s right-wing forces in order to ensure continuity with his policies . 
But Colombia does not seem to want continuity at any price ; instead it now appears to favor moderate revision of what Uribe has built over the past decade . 
This renovation comes in a form that is unusual in contemporary Colombian history . 
The alliance between presidential candidate Antanas Mockus and vice-presidential candidate Sergio Fajardo offers the possibility of a real break , because neither man comes from the currently weakened traditional liberal-conservative political milieu . 
Instead , each comes from the world of academia ( both hold doctorates in mathematics ) . 
Their principal - and successful - experience is in local politics . 
Mockus was mayor of Bogota and Fajardo mayor of Medellin , and both want to shift the government &apos;s main priority from internal security to strengthening the rule of law , education , science and technology , productivity , and SOUND public finances . 
Neither is backed by urban political machines or shady armed organizations in rural areas , but by independent groups , non-ideologically inclined citizens , and new voters keen to cast their ballots for unconventional candidates . 
Both have ingeniously mobilized young people and made innovative use of online social networks . 
The Mockus-Fajardo ticket proudly portrays the two men as political outsiders , with all the attendant risks and benefits . 
Their electoral platform - which also promotes a sense of generational change - is centered on their rejection of illegality and corruption , two issues that galvanize broad popular support . 
Indeed , this yearning for change is why Mockus , the son of Lithuanian immigrants , may reach the presidency in a country that experienced only a scant influx of foreigners in the twentieth century . 
The Mockus phenomenon is in many ways the Colombian analog of the rise of &quot; alternative &quot; presidents across Latin America in recent years : Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil , Michelle Bachelet in Chile , Evo Morales in Bolivia , Mauricio Funes in El Salvador , Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua , José Mujica in Uruguay , Rafael Correa in Ecuador , Fernando Lugo in Paraguay , and Hugo Chávez in Venezuela . 
But Mockus is different . 
In contrast to men like Funes , Ortega , Mujica , and Chávez , whose careers began in guerrilla movements or failed coups , Mockus &apos;s past is irreproachable . 
He has never been co-opted by private interests , be they political , economic , or criminal . 
He trusts his instincts and likes imaginative public policies , though this worries those who fear another messianic leader at the head of the government . 
Moreover , Mockus &apos;s sensitivity towards human-rights concerns distinguishes him from Uribe , who leaves behind a deplorable legacy in this regard . 
Obviously the FARC guerrillas - much diminished by Uribe , but still violently opposed to Colombian democracy - remain a source of concern for many Colombians . 
But , because the Mockus-Fajardo ticket is truly centrist , the risk of serious missteps in this area seems minimal . 
Moreover , the shadow over the election campaign does not come from the FARC , but from the right - the Uribist candidate Santos and the conservative Noemí Sanin . 
The Liberal Party , a coalition comprising a cross-section of the center-left , and the leftist Polo Democrático have no chance of victory , although their support for a Mockus government would be important in forging a stable parliamentary majority . 
Conversely , legislative elections in March gave the Mockus-Fajardo ticket only minimal representation in the two chambers of Congress , implying that any government that they form would need all the legislative allies that it can find in order to enact its agenda . 
If , as appears increasingly likely , Mockus becomes president , his agenda promises to be prudent - neither a leap into the void nor immobilized by the need for profound changes . 
Three issues will hold his attention initially : the potent mafia subculture that has arisen over the last decade , the need to redirect a development model marked by extensive inequality , and avoidance of isolation and overreaction in the country &apos;s foreign relations . 
Colombia may be on the cusp of achieving a long-cherished but oft-postponed dream : domestic peace and diminishing tension with its neighbors . 
Antanas Mockus looks like the figure best suited to realizing these possibilities .
