When Interest Rates Rise 
CAMBRIDGE - Long-term interest rates are now unsustainably low , implying bubbles in the prices of bonds and other securities . 
When interest rates rise , as they surely will , the bubbles will burst , the prices of those securities will fall , and anyone holding them will be hurt . 
To the extent that banks and other highly leveraged financial institutions hold them , the bursting bubbles could cause bankruptcies and financial-market breakdown . 
The very low interest rate on long-term United States Treasury bonds is a clear example of the current mispricing of financial assets . 
A ten-year Treasury has a nominal interest rate of less than 2 % . 
Because the inflation rate is also about 2 % , this implies a negative real interest rate , which is confirmed by the interest rate of -0.6 % on ten-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities ( TIPS ) , which adjust interest and principal payments for inflation . 
Historically , the real interest rate on ten-year Treasuries has been above 2 % ; thus , today &apos;s rate is about two percentage points below its historical average . 
But those historical rates prevailed at times when fiscal deficits and federal government debt were much lower than they are today . 
With budget deficits that are projected to be 5 % of GDP by the end of the coming decade , and a debt / GDP ratio that has roughly doubled in the past five years and is continuing to grow , the real interest rate on Treasuries should be significantly higher than it was in the past . 
The reason for today &apos;s unsustainably low long-term rates is not a mystery . 
The Federal Reserve &apos;s policy of &quot; long-term asset purchases , &quot; also known as &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; has intentionally kept long-term rates low . 
The Fed is buying Treasury bonds and long-term mortgage-backed securities at a rate of $ 85 billion a month , equivalent to an annual rate of $ 1,020 billion . 
Since that exceeds the size of the government deficit , it implies that private markets do not need to buy any of the newly issued government debt . 
The Fed has indicated that it will eventually end its program of long-term asset purchases and allow rates to rise to more normal levels . 
Although it has not indicated just when rates will rise or how high they will go , the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) projects that the rate on ten-year Treasuries will rise above 5 % by 2019 and remain above that level for the next five years . 
The interest rates projected by the CBO assume that future inflation will be only 2.2 % . 
If inflation turns out to be higher ( a very likely outcome of the Fed &apos;s recent policy ) , the interest rate on long-term bonds could be correspondingly higher . 
Investors are buying long-term bonds at the current low interest rates because the interest rate on short-term investments is now close to zero . 
In other words , buyers are getting an additional 2 % current yield in exchange for assuming the risk of holding long-term bonds . 
That is likely to be a money-losing strategy unless an investor is sagacious or lucky enough to sell the bond before interest rates rise . 
If not , the loss in the price of the bond would more than wipe out the extra interest that he earned , even if rates remain unchanged for five years . 
Here is how the arithmetic works for an investor who rolls over ten-year bonds for the next five years , thus earning 2 % more each year than he would by investing in Treasury bills or bank deposits . 
Assume that the interest rate on ten-year bonds remains unchanged for the next five years and then rises from 2 % to 5 % . 
During those five years , the investor earns an additional 2 % each year , for a cumulative gain of 10 % . 
But when the interest rate on a ten-year bond rises to 5 % , the bond &apos;s price falls from $ 100 to $ 69 . 
The investor loses $ 31 on the price of the bond , or three times more than he had gained in higher interest payments . 
The low interest rate on long-term Treasury bonds has also boosted demand for other long-term assets that promise higher yields , including equities , farm land , high-yield corporate bonds , gold , and real estate . 
When interest rates rise , the prices of those assets will fall as well . 
The Fed has pursued its strategy of low long-term interest rates in the hope of stimulating economic activity . 
At this point , the extent of the stimulus seems very small , and the risk of financial bubbles is increasingly worrying . 
The US is not the only country with very low or negative real long-term interest rates . 
Germany , Britain , and Japan all have similarly low long rates . 
And , in each of these countries , it is likely that interest rates will rise during the next few years , imposing losses on holders of long-term bonds and potentially impairing the stability of financial institutions . 
Even if the major advanced economies &quot; current monetary strategies do not lead to rising inflation , we may look back on these years as a time when official policy led to individual losses and overall financial instability .
