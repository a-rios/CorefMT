Trapped on the Right 
LONDON : Judged by its outcome , Britain &apos;s general election lacked suspense and surprise . 
Throughout its four years in power , Tony Blair &apos;s New Labour government enjoyed a large and steady lead in opinion polls . 
When Blair called for new elections , victory was taken for granted . 
Yet the election was revealing , not only of problems within British politics , but also of similar stresses in political systems across the West . 
From the Labour Party &apos;s point of view , this second election was a test of its credibility as a normal party of government . 
For nearly 80 years Labour was the main political alternative to the Conservative Party or Tories , and in several general elections it defeated them . 
Nevertheless , the Conservatives seemed the more normal party of government . 
Labour &apos;s position as an outsider was underlined by the fact that it was never elected to two consecutive full terms of government . 
Until now . 
Labour succeeded because Tony Blair jettisoned Labour &apos;s entrenched left-wing dogmas . 
Traditional Socialist nostrums - nationalization , price controls , government direction - had failed in the past , could not be expected to work in the future , and thus held no credibility with voters . 
So Blair decided that New Labour would not just accept , but embrace the principle of market forces . 
By stealing the economic policy clothes of the Tories , Blair exposed the ambivalent posture of the Conservative Party in Britain . 
This ambivalence has been , until now , common to almost all mainstream center-right parties in Europe . 
Publicly , each claims legitimacy by offering to the wider society dynamic programs of modernization , liberalization and competent economic management ; privately they promise their friends that they will promote sectoral interests and preserve social privileges . 
So long as left-wing parties seemed suspect , implausible or even semi-revolutionary , center-right parties could conceal their internal contradictions . 
When New Labour embraced market economics , the Tories were wrong-footed . 
They could no longer claim their traditional role as the party of reliable economic management because , during its four years in power , New Labour delivered an impressive record of economic competence and stability , with high growth and low inflation . 
As a result , William Hague , the Tory leader , shifted his party further to the right . 
At home , his main policy proposal was for large tax cuts , with the clear implication that this could lead to cuts in public services . 
Abroad , his main agenda was nakedly xenophobic : No to membership in the Euro , significant disengagement from the European Union , and a harsher policy towards foreign asylum-seekers . 
It is not difficult to discern parallels between Britain &apos;s Conservatives and America &apos;s Republican Party . 
President Clinton presided over eight years of successful fiscal management and prosperity , so George W. Bush could not claim this middle ground . 
Instead , he moved further right , with massive tax cuts as his main economic proposal . 
Similarly , his administration &apos;s declared positions on the environment , on energy , on defense and on foreign policy are all strongly right-wing or unilateralist or both . 
But neither in Britain nor in America is there evidence that the electorate has moved to the right in this way . 
The difference is that George W. Bush won the presidency by a whisker , whereas William Hague could not avoid defeat . 
The dilemma in Britain is the same as that of any West European country : the move by left-of-center parties to the middle ground , and their acceptance of market forces , means that right-of-center parties have lost their traditional claim to govern on the grounds of economic moderation and good sense . 
The result is a growing temptation to react by moving further right , even though elections are usually won in the center . 
William Hague &apos;s campaign was dominated by his call to &quot; save the pound &quot; and stay out of the Euro . 
In fact , no one knows whether Tony Blair will seek to join the Euro , let alone win a referendum on it . 
Most polls show a large majority against . 
The irony here is that the Euro played an enormous part , directly and indirectly , in moving Britain , like other EU members , in the direction of free markets and fiscal discipline . 
Britain may or may not join the Euro , but the policies adopted by Labour - privatization , low budget deficits , low inflation , an independent central bank - are precisely those it would need if it did decide to join . 
Indeed , the Euro has been one of the main instruments in moving Europe &apos;s center-left parties onto the middle ground , or even to the center-right . 
But the response of some center-right parties in Europe has been to move further right , specifically in an anti-Europe or nationalistic direction . 
Under Angela Merkel &apos;s leadership , for example , Germany &apos;s Christian Democrats are increasingly flirting with xenophobia . 
In Italy , Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s government also appears tainted with right-wing populism and xenophobia . 
He , like William Hague and George W Bush , is promising to slash taxes . 
Under Euro rules , governments must observe strict limits on their budget deficits and public debt . 
Berlusconi &apos;s promised tax cuts may soon run up against both Treaty limits , and will likely incite conflict with other Euro area governments if they do . 
Today ought to be a golden age for center-right parties : Communists and Socialists have self-destructed , free markets are spreading as inexorably as globalization , and prosperity beckons . 
So why , in these seemingly ideal circumstances , can &apos;t the right find a plausible political story to tell - one which reconciles liberal government with liberal economics ? 
In Europe , this should not be too difficult , because some version of an answer can surely be found in the context of the European Union . 
Many right-wing politicians , however , appear to prefer taking refuge in populism , nationalism and nostalgia .
