Ukraine &apos;s Democratic Choice 
Suddenly , Ukraine faces another stark choice : dismiss the government and parliament and hold new elections , or see the country &apos;s independence surrendered bit by bit . 
There is renewed talk , too , of violent civil unrest . 
None of this should be surprising , given how our corrupt rulers systematically incite regional and ethnic hatred . 
Some say that President Viktor Yushchenko &apos;s decision this week to dismiss Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s government was unwarranted . 
They are wrong : Yushchenko &apos;s actions were necessary because the Yanukovych government , in clear violation of the law , was preparing to mount a constitutional coup that would have stripped the president of his remaining supervisory powers over the army and police . 
Either the president acted now , or Ukraine would return to the absolute rule of criminal clans that existed before our Orange Revolution in 2004 . 
I did not agree with Yushchenko &apos;s decision to appoint Yanukovych prime minister following last year &apos;s parliamentary election . 
And so it has . 
But the ultimate shortcoming of that cohabitation was its curtailment of the democratic process . 
Ukraine &apos;s democrats , who won that election , were denied their voice and their place in government . 
Yushchenko offered his hand to his foes in good faith so as to bind up our nation &apos;s wounds ; in return , the governing pact that he reached with Yanukovych was betrayed at every turn . 
A new election will restore democratic choice - and thus revitalize our democracy . 
Europe and the world are , of course , right to worry . 
But Ukraine has changed dramatically since the Orange Revolution . 
Even those Europeans who believe - wrongly - that democracy does not easily take root in post-Soviet countries should recognize that our people now feel empowered . 
A country that emerged so recently from one period of dictatorship is unlikely to volunteer for another at the hands of a man who sought to falsify the presidential election of 2004 . 
Economic growth since the Orange Revolution reinforces that reluctance , because an expanding middle class nearly always prefers the flexibility of pluralism to the thump of an authoritarian &apos;s fist . 
The general election called for May 27 will help to keep things this way . 
But the dangers that Ukraine faces are serious , stemming from problems - particularly fragile institutions and economic dislocation - that are common to every young post-communist democracy , as well as from some special problems of its own . 
Many of Ukraine &apos;s richest citizens , who gained their wealth through the crony capitalism that is the only way Yanukovych knows how to govern , remain unreconciled to Ukraine &apos;s democracy . 
For them , manufactured discontent in Ukraine &apos;s Russian-speaking regions - which have embraced a centrifugal tendency greater than in any other European democracy - impels them toward the system of managed democracy found in Russia in order to protect their continued misrule . 
A decade ago , the world had a foretaste of what can happen when ethnic divisions are exploited for sinister political purposes . 
Yugoslavia is but a miniature version of what might happen in Ukraine if Yanukovych &apos;s tactics are allowed to bring ethnic antagonisms to the boiling point . 
It is natural , as is demonstrated by the huge majority - even among the Russian minority - that continues to support the country &apos;s independence . 
So it would be wrong to say that the democratic center cannot hold in Ukraine . 
The best and still most living thing about our Orange Revolution was the democratic empowerment of our people . 
As a result , something remarkable for a former Soviet country informs the habits of those who are demanding that their liberties be preserved : a deep respect for the rule of law , which is the ultimate check on abuse of power . 
Our people understand that the Yanukovych government is not just political poison . 
It seeks to dominate , and deaden , the whole economy , too . 
No business can be conducted without kowtowing to the regime for permission . 
Ukraine &apos;s neighbors should now help us by offering support and hope . 
Europe must send a clear signal that Ukraine , unlike Czechoslovakia to Neville Chamberlain in 1938 , is not some faraway place of which it knows little , but rather an integral part of the European project . 
After all , the European Union is first and foremost a community of democracies : if Ukraine can aspire to membership , any oligarch or criminal politician who undermines that prospect will have to face the ire of all Ukrainians . 
Moreover , all of Europe needs a truly democratic Ukraine . 
New elections to secure our democracy are the only way forward , both for us and for advancing Europe &apos;s interest in seeing that genuine democracy takes root in the nations of the former Soviet Union .
