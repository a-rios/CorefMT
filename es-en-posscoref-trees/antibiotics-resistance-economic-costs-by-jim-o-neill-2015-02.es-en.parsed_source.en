A Call to Antimicrobial Arms 
JAKARTA - In December , I reported the first findings of the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance , which I chair . 
The news wasn &apos;t good : Resistant infections already claim more than 700,000 lives a year . 
Unless action is taken , antimicrobial resistance will kill ten million people a year by 2050 - more than the number of people who currently die from cancer . 
It will also have a cumulative cost of at least $ 100 trillion , more than 1.5 times today &apos;s annual global GDP . 
We are not doing nearly enough to combat this danger . 
The world urgently needs new drugs to replace the antibiotics , anti-malarial regimes , anti-retroviral AIDS and HIV medications , and tuberculosis treatments that are losing effectiveness . 
But we do not invest enough in research and development . 
It is critical that we find new sources of funding to support the academic researchers and small companies whose discoveries are laying the foundations for tomorrow &apos;s medicines . 
That is why I am calling on international donors - philanthropic and governmental alike - to work with the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance to create a new fund to support R D in this important area . 
The fund will provide grants for blue-sky science and act as a non-profit incubator for promising discoveries . 
Over the coming months , the Review will be working out the details of how such a fund could operate effectively . 
The problem is straightforward : As valuable as scientific breakthroughs may be , it takes a lot of work to turn them into marketable drugs . 
And , because antibiotics generally produce low - and sometimes even negative - returns on investment for the pharmaceutical makers that develop them , many companies and venture capital funds steer clear . 
The Review is studying ways to align financial incentives for developing new antimicrobial drugs more closely with these medicines &quot; true social value . 
But time is of the essence . 
New drugs take decades to discover and develop . 
Even if we were to fix every problem in the development pipeline today , it would be at least another ten years before the first new antibiotics became commercially available . 
In the coming months , the Review will make recommendations regarding market incentives for developing new antibiotics and searching for potential alternatives - such as vaccines - to the use of these drugs in agriculture . 
The Review will also highlight innovative approaches to addressing resistance . 
In its most recent paper , the Review has identified specific measures that could provide a starting point for the fight against antimicrobial resistance . 
The first is the creation of the innovation fund to support early research . 
In addition to providing money for efforts to develop new drugs , the fund should encourage research into diagnostic tools , surveillance methods , techniques to slow the development of resistance , and social and economic studies of consumer behavior . 
This kind of basic research is where medical innovation starts , and the sums involved need not be huge to make a significant difference . 
We should also invest more in the people who will solve the problem . 
Evidence seems to show that young scientists and doctors are reluctant to enter fields related to antimicrobial resistance . 
We need to nurture the next generation of academics , scientists , hospital workers , and pharmaceutical technicians . 
Governments , for their part , should work closely with companies that produce diagnostic tools and surveillance techniques , and support useful technologies as they are developed . 
It is essential that countries work together to gain a better understanding of how antimicrobials are used around the world . 
And , finally , we need to develop new treatments that use alternative doses and combinations of existing drugs . 
Likewise , we should reconsider potential medications that never made it to market because of side effects that could now be rendered safe . 
In the coming months , I will travel to India and China to discuss antimicrobial resistance with senior policymakers and companies . 
Both of these countries are particularly vulnerable . 
By 2050 , antimicrobial resistance could impose a cumulative economic cost of $ 20 trillion on China - equivalent to about two years of its current GDP . 
Even more worryingly , by then China could be losing one million people per year to resistant bacteria and microbes . 
In India , the death toll could reach two million a year . 
It is statistics like these that have led me to conclude that the fight against antimicrobial resistance must be placed high on the G-20 &quot; s agenda . 
It is my hope that China , when it assumes leadership of the G-20 in 2016 , will play a constructive role in this regard . 
A solution to antimicrobial resistance need not be expensive . 
It is likely to cost the world much less than 0.1 % of global GDP . 
Weighed against the alternative - $ 100 trillion in lost production by 2050 and ten million lives lost every year - it is clearly one of the wisest investments we can make .
