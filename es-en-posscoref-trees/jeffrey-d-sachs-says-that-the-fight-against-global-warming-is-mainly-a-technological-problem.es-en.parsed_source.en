The Limits of Climate Negotiations 
NEW YORK - If the world is to solve the climate-change crisis , we will need a new approach . 
Currently , the major powers view climate change as a negotiation over who will reduce their CO2 emissions ( mainly from the use of coal , oil , and gas ) . 
Each agrees to small &quot; contributions &quot; of emission reduction , trying to nudge the other countries to do more . 
The United States , for example , will &quot; concede &quot; a little bit of CO2 reduction if China will do the same . 
For two decades , we have been trapped in this minimalist and incremental mindset , which is wrong in two key ways . 
First , it is not working : CO2 emissions are rising , not falling . 
The global oil industry is having a field day - fracking , drilling , exploring in the Arctic , gasifying coal , and building new liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) facilities . 
The world is wrecking the climate and food-supply systems at a breakneck pace . 
Second , &quot; decarbonizing &quot; the energy system is technologically complicated . 
America &apos;s real problem is not competition from China ; it &apos;s the complexity of shifting a $ 17.5 trillion economy from fossil fuels to low-carbon alternatives . 
China &apos;s problem is not the US , but how to wean the world &apos;s largest , or second largest economy ( depending on which data are used ) off its deeply entrenched dependence on coal . 
These are mainly engineering problems , not negotiating problems . 
To be sure , both economies could decarbonize if they cut output sharply . 
But neither the US nor China is ready to sacrifice millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to do so . 
Indeed , the question is how to decarbonize while remaining economically strong . 
Climate negotiators cannot answer that question , but innovators like Elon Musk of Tesla , and scientists like Klaus Lackner of Columbia University , can . 
Decarbonizing the world &apos;s energy system requires preventing our production of vast and growing amounts of electricity from boosting atmospheric CO2 emissions . 
It also presupposes a switchover to a zero-carbon transport fleet and a lot more production per kilowatt-hour of energy . 
Zero-carbon electricity is within reach . 
Solar and wind power can deliver that already , but not necessarily when and where needed . 
We need storage breakthroughs for these intermittent clean-energy sources . 
Nuclear power , another important source of zero-carbon energy , will also need to play a big role in the future , implying the need to bolster public confidence in its safety . 
Even fossil fuels can produce zero-carbon electricity , if carbon capture and storage is used . 
Lackner is a world leader in new CCS strategies . 
Electrification of transport is already with us , and Tesla , with its sophisticated electric vehicles , is capturing the public &apos;s imagination and interest . 
Yet further technological advances are needed in order to reduce electric vehicles &quot; costs , increase their reliability , and extend their range . 
Musk , eager to spur rapid development of the vehicles , made history last week by opening Tesla &apos;s patents for use by competitors . 
Technology offers new breakthroughs in energy efficiency as well . 
New building designs have slashed heating and cooling costs by relying much more on insulation , natural ventilation , and solar power . 
Advances in nanotechnology offer the prospect of lighter construction materials that require much less energy to produce , making both buildings and vehicles far more energy efficient . 
The world needs a concerted push to adopt to low-carbon electricity , not another &quot; us-versus-them &quot; negotiation . 
All countries need new , low-carbon technologies , many of which are still out of commercial reach . 
Climate negotiators should therefore be focusing on how to cooperate to ensure that technology breakthroughs are achieved and benefit all countries . 
They should take their cue from other cases in which government , scientists , and industry teamed up to produce major changes . 
For example , in carrying out the Manhattan Project ( to produce the atomic bomb during World War II ) and the first moon landing , the US government set a remarkable technological goal , established a bold timetable , and committed the financial resources needed to get the job done . 
In both cases , the scientists and engineers delivered on time . 
The example of atomic bombs might seem an unpleasant one , yet it raises an important question : If we ask governments and scientists to cooperate on war technology , shouldn &apos;t we do at least the same to save the planet from carbon pollution ? 
In fact , the process of &quot; directed technological change , &quot; in which bold objectives are set , milestones are identified , and timelines are put into place , is much more common than many realize . 
The information-technology revolution that has brought us computers , smart phones , GPS , and much more , was built on a series of industry and government roadmaps . 
The human genome was mapped through such a government-led effort - one that ultimately brought in the private sector as well . 
More recently , government and industry got together to cut the costs of sequencing an individual genome from around $ 100 million in 2001 to just $ 1,000 today . 
A dramatic cost-cutting goal was set , scientists went to work , and the targeted breakthrough was achieved on time . 
Fighting climate change does depend on all countries having confidence that their competitors will follow suit . 
So , yes , let the upcoming climate negotiations spell out shared actions by the US , China , Europe , and others . 
But let &apos;s stop pretending that this is a poker game , rather than a scientific and technological puzzle of the highest order . 
We need the likes of Musk , Lackner , General Electric , Siemens , Ericsson , Intel , Electricit√© de France , Huawei , Google , Baidu , Samsung , Apple , and others in laboratories , power plants , and cities around the world to forge the technological breakthroughs that will reduce global CO2 emissions . 
There is even a place at the table for ExxonMobil , Chevron , BP , Peabody , Koch Industries , and other oil and coal giants . 
If they expect their products to be used in the future , they had better make them safe through the deployment of advanced CCS technologies . 
The point is that targeted and deep decarbonization is a job for all stakeholders , including the fossil-fuel industry , and one in which we must all be on the side of human survival and wellbeing .
