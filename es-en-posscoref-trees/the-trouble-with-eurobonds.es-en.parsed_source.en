The Trouble with Eurobonds 
MUNICH - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has withstood the pressure from southern Europe : there will be no Eurobonds . 
For the markets , this is a disappointment , but there is no other way for these countries to rebuild themselves than to insist patiently on a phase of debt discipline and an end to lax budget constraints . 
Investors in Europe &apos;s troubled economies are already getting enough as it is . 
Eurozone leaders &quot; decision on July 21 to allow the European Financial Stability Facility to buy back old debts - limited only by the EFSF &apos;s capacity - already amounts to a type of Eurobond . 
And the European Central Bank will also blithely continue its bailout policy in terms of giving loans to the eurozone &apos;s troubled members and purchasing their government bonds . 
Southern Europe , however , is pushing hard for a complete changeover to Eurobonds to get rid of the interest-rate premiums relative to Germany that markets are demanding of them . 
This is understandable , given that the hope of interest-rate convergence was a decisive reason for these countries to join the euro in the first place . 
For the Italian state , interest-rate convergence brought a medium-term reduction in debt-service payments of up to 6 % of GDP . 
That would have been sufficient to pay back the entire Italian national debt over about a decade and a half . 
Italy &apos;s debt-to-GDP ratio today , at 120 % , is as high as it was when the country entered the eurozone in the mid-1990 &quot; s . 
Now that interest-rate spreads are increasing again , the pain is considerable , prompting calls for Eurobonds . 
But who is to make these guarantees ? 
The debt-to-GDP ratios of France and Germany are well above 80 % , which isn &apos;t all that far below Italy &apos;s - and far above Spain &apos;s . 
Pooling debts doesn &apos;t make them go away . 
Everybody and every country must service their own debts ; there is no way around that . 
And , incidentally , the current agitation about interest rates is a bit over the top . 
The interest rates that countries like Italy and Spain have to pay today are only half as high as they were in 1995 , before the conversion rates within the eurozone were set ; likewise , interest-rate spreads vis-Ã -vis Germany today are only two-thirds of their size then . 
There is no indication that the markets are dysfunctional and overstating the differences between countries &quot; creditworthiness . 
The spreads are necessary to keep capital flows within the eurozone in check . 
Before the introduction of the euro , capital flows had been limited by uncertainty about exchange rates . 
Now , without exchange-rate risk , interest-rate spreads based on debtor countries &quot; credit ratings are the only remaining defense against excessive capital movements and the resulting external imbalances . 
If investors are given unlimited protection , with no risk of bearing their share of possible losses , capital will continue to flow unimpeded from one corner of the eurozone to the other , prolonging these imbalances . 
For many years , Italy has disregarded the debt ceilings imposed by the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact . 
Only when interest rates recently began to rise a bit did the government finally - and promptly - implement an austerity program , with the approval of all political parties . 
The markets , not political debt ceilings , are taken seriously ; the introduction of Eurobonds would remove that disciplining function . 
To a limited extent , the same applies to the EU bailouts and ECB interventions . 
These could be justified during the recession of 2008-2009 , but now they have become counter-productive , because they undermine the markets &quot; controlling function . 
By replacing the private credit that is being withdrawn with public credit , the external imbalances within the eurozone are being perpetuated . 
Even today , four years into the crisis , there are no signs that the overly expensive countries in Europe &apos;s southern periphery have begun devaluation in real terms by cutting wages and prices . 
That , however , is a precondition for reducing external imbalances and reliance on foreign credit . 
The bailouts are prolonging the crisis because they amount to an attempt to keep asset prices at a level above the market equilibrium , creating a unilateral downward risk that is limited only by the deep pockets of the relief funds . 
This is reminiscent of central banks &quot; futile efforts , back when fixed exchange-rate regimes were common , to stabilize rates above their market equilibrium . 
The result , much like today , was merely to exacerbate market turbulence . 
It is time for Europe to face reality and initiate the difficult adjustment processes within the real economy that are necessary to rebalance the eurozone . 
Eurobonds would numb the distressed countries &quot; current pain , but , by failing to treat the underlying disease , they - and the eurozone as a whole - would end up far sicker than before .
