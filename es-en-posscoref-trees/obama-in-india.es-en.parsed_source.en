Obama in India 
NEW DELHI - Barack Obama , the sixth American president to visit India since it gained independence , arrives at a trying time , both for the United States and for India . 
Some of Obama &apos;s closest advisers have just resigned , opening an awkward gap on national security and the economy - the focus of his meetings with India &apos;s government . 
For India , the issues on the agenda for Obama &apos;s visit are immense and complex , and the options for resolving them are extremely limited . 
Those related to security in Afghanistan and Pakistan are as treacherous as they have ever been . 
Bilateral economic , trade , and currency disagreements may not be as bitter as they are between the US and China , but they are thorny , and lack of resolution is making them more intractable . 
Nuclear non-proliferation remains one of Obama &apos;s priorities , as does the sale of US civilian nuclear technology to India , for which former President George W. Bush cleared the way . 
And Obama will be keen to know what help India can provide with Iran , a country with which India has smooth relations , owing to their shared worries over Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
Given this potent list of challenges , what are the prospects for Obama &apos;s passage to India ? 
Some years ago , I was queried by then US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott , who was helping to prepare President Bill Clinton &apos;s visit . 
As India &apos;s foreign minister at the time , I told him : &quot; Why make the visit destinational ? 
Be content with the directional , &quot; or some such words . 
That response retains its flavor today : as new directions in India-US relations are set , new destinations will follow . 
All state visits are overloaded with lofty , superfluous rhetoric . 
US-India summits are particularly prone to this hubris : the Great Republic meets the World &apos;s Largest Democracy . 
It would be better for both countries to shed some of these marigold garlands of cloying adjectives . 
Another feature of such summits - the trading of lists of &quot; must do &quot; and &quot; can do &quot; items - also should be retired . 
It is both demeaning and tedious to treat an arriving US president as a stars-and-stripes Santa Claus , to be presented with lengthy wish lists . 
Likewise , despite America &apos;s pinched economic circumstances , Obama would do well not to use his visit to peddle US wares . 
Although trade is an effective lubricant of good relations , these sorts of talks are for the &quot; sherpas , &quot; not Obama and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , to handle . 
These two great countries , &quot; natural allies &quot; in the words of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee , should reflect on what they have accomplished together since 1998 , in order to map what lies ahead . 
Theirs is now a relationship of equals , so their national interests need to be reconciled on everything from Pakistan to climate change . 
Indeed , Obama is placed in a unique position for an American president , a position that he appears to comprehend , though his opponents in the US do not . 
Power today begins in the acceptance of the limits upon it . 
This is also true of an India that is only now coming to recognize its new status in the world , in which the country &apos;s limits and responsibilities have expanded mightily . 
Ours is an unstable neighborhood , one that America has entered without fully understanding the consequences - for India and for the neighborhood . 
India must ask Obama hard questions about how security is to be assured , but , before doing so , it needs to ask the same questions of itself . 
India must make clear - and the US must recognize - that a sub-continental country of a billion-plus people cannot be kept within the categorical confines of &quot; South Asia . &quot; 
The US must accept and candidly discuss the damaging consequences of its military , diplomatic , and political overreach - of a &quot; war too far &quot; that has brought the region to its current ugly impasse . 
What can the two countries do , separately and together ? 
Both leaders must accept that history is destiny , and that the irrefutable logic of geography is a determinant of it . 
This is the only relevant and reliable guide in meeting the region &apos;s complex challenges . 
The constraints on US options , the veto of circumstances , offers little room for diplomatic improvisation . 
Here the greatest constraint is America &apos;s difficult and worsening relationship with Pakistan . 
India must understand this troubled partnership , into which America entered with its eyes wide open , though it would help if the US accepted that India has paid - and continues to pay - a very high price on this account . 
Only through such acceptance can the two countries chart a common future . 
Likewise , it would be unwise for the US gratuitously to offer China a role in the affairs of a region that includes India itself - something that Obama appeared to do during his visit to China earlier this year , when he mentioned China as having a role to play in Kashmir . 
The US should also stop questioning India &apos;s relationship with Iran , a neighbor with which India is linked by many centuries of economic , cultural , and even civilizational ties . 
Two great peoples and countries , although now locked in a &quot; strategic alliance , &quot; may occasionally fall out of step with one another , as India and the US have - for example , over global climate negotiations . 
But , at such moments , Obama might do well to recall Vajpayee &apos;s words during Clinton &apos;s visit , when he quoted Walt Whitman &apos;s poem &quot; Passage to India &quot; : 
&quot; Sail forth - steer for the deep waters only ,
