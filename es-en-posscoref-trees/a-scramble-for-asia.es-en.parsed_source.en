A Scramble for Asia ? 
NEW DELHI - Asia &apos;s festering Cold War-era territorial and maritime disputes highlight the fact that securing long-term region-wide peace depends on respect for existing borders . 
Attempts to disturb Asia &apos;s territorial status quo are an invitation to endemic conflict - a concern that led Asian states to welcome the US and Russia to their annual East Asian Summit . 
The recent Sino-Japanese diplomatic spat over disputed islands in the East China Sea - followed , almost instantly , by a Sino-Vietnamese row over similar atolls - has put the spotlight on China and its regional policy . 
Governments across Asia are concerned that China &apos;s rapidly accumulating power is emboldening it to assert territorial and maritime claims against neighbors stretching from Japan to India . 
Even against tiny Bhutan , China has stepped up its lands claims through military incursions . 
China &apos;s new stridency underscores Asia &apos;s central diplomatic challenge : coming to terms with existing boundaries by shedding the baggage of history that burdens all of the region &apos;s important inter-state relationships . 
Even as Asia is becoming more interdependent economically , it is becoming more politically divided . 
A number of inter-state wars were fought in Asia since 1950 , the year that both the Korean War and the annexation of Tibet started . 
But , whereas the Europe &apos;s bloody wars in the first half of the twentieth century have made war there unthinkable today , the wars in Asia in the second half of the twentieth century , far from settling or ending disputes , only accentuated bitter rivalries . 
China , significantly , has been involved in the largest number of military conflicts in Asia . 
A recent Pentagon report is unsparing : &quot; The history of modern Chinese warfare provides numerous case studies in which China &apos;s leaders have claimed military preemption as a strategically defensive act . 
For example , China refers to its intervention in the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) as the &quot; War to Resist the United States and Aid Korea . &quot; 
Similarly , authoritative texts refer to border conflicts against India ( 1962 ) , the Soviet Union ( 1969 ) , and Vietnam ( 1979 ) as &quot; Self-Defense Counter Attacks . &quot; &quot; 
The seizure of the Paracel Islands from Vietnam in 1974 by Chinese forces was another example of offense as defense . 
All these cases of preemption occurred when China was weak , poor , and internally torn . 
Having earlier preached the gospel of its &quot; peaceful rise , &quot; China no longer is shy about showcasing its military capabilities and asserting itself on multiple fronts . 
With the Chinese Communist Party increasingly dependent on the military to maintain its monopoly on power and ensure domestic order , senior military officers are overtly influencing foreign policy . 
The result is a growing territorial assertiveness , which has become a source of new friction along China &apos;s land and sea frontiers . 
That , in turn , has put China at the center of Asia &apos;s political divides . 
Several developments this year underscore China &apos;s more muscular foreign policy , from its inclusion of the South China Sea in its &quot; core &quot; national interests - a move that makes its claims to the disputed Spratly Islands non-negotiable - to its reference to the Yellow Sea as a sort of exclusive Chinese military-operations zone . 
The US and South Korea should , according to Chinese officials , discontinue holding joint naval exercises there , apparently out of respect for China &apos;s new power . 
China also has become more insistent in pressing its territorial claims both to India &apos;s northeastern Arunachal Pradesh state and to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands , with Chinese warships making more frequent forays into Japanese waters . 
Indian defense officials have reported a sharp increase in Chinese military incursions across the disputed 4,057-kilometer Himalayan frontier and in aggressive patrolling . 
China also has started questioning Indian sovereignty over the state of Jammu and Kashmir , one-fifth of which it occupied following the Tibet annexation . 
Beijing &apos;s 2004 spat with South Korea over the ancient kingdom of Koguryo - triggered by a revised historical claim posted on the Chinese foreign ministry &apos;s Web site that the empire , founded in the Tongge river basin of northern Korea , was Chinese - was seen as an attempt to hedge China &apos;s options vis-Ã -vis a potentially unified Korea . 
By signaling that the present China-North Korea border may not be final , Beijing has raised the specter of potential tensions over frontiers in the future . 
Against that background , China &apos;s increasingly assertive territorial and maritime claims threaten Asian peace and stability . 
In fact , the largest real estate China covets is not in the South or East China Seas : India &apos;s Arunachal Pradesh is almost three times larger than Taiwan . 
Respect for boundaries is a prerequisite to peace and stability on any continent . 
Europe has built its peace on that principle , with a number of European states learning to live with boundaries that they don &apos;t like . 
But the Chinese Communist Party still harps on old grievances to reinforce its claim to legitimacy : full restoration of China &apos;s &quot; dignity &quot; after a century of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers . 
Through its overt refusal to accept Asia &apos;s territorial status quo , China only highlights the futility of political negotiations . 
After all , frontiers are never significantly redrawn at the negotiating table , but only on the battlefield , as China has shown in the past . 
Today , whether it is Arunachal Pradesh or Taiwan or the Senkaku Islands or even the Spratlys , China is dangling the threat of force to assert its claims . 
By picking territorial fights with its neighbors , China is not only reinforcing old rivalries , but is also threatening Asia &apos;s continued economic renaissance - showing that it is not a credible candidate to lead Asia . 
It is important for other Asian states and the US - a &quot; resident power &quot; in Asia , in the words of US Defense Secretary Robert Gates - to convey a clear message to China : a peaceful rise and unilateral redrawing of frontiers don &apos;t mix .
