The Realism of Global Optimism 
PRAGUE - Read a newspaper or watch the evening news , and the world always seems to be getting worse . 
One problem after another is put under a spotlight . 
The more death , destruction , and despair , the better . 
As one Danish journalism textbook puts it : &quot; A good story is usually bad news . &quot; 
Only occasionally do we get uplifting , things-are-getting-better stories . 
When we do , they feel like a guilty pleasure . 
As a result , we often think that the world is in worse shape than it is - even if we think our own lives are improving . 
Consider this : Since 1978 , American consumers have been asked whether their current financial situation is better or worse than it was a year earlier . 
Over the past 25 years , an average of 38 % have said they are doing better , while 32 % have said they are doing worse . 
But , when asked the same question about the overall US economy , an average of 47 % have said it is doing worse , compared to 38 % who think it is doing better . 
More people think their lives are improving , while others are doing worse , probably because of journalists &quot; persistent bias in favor of bad news . 
The phenomenon is not limited to the United States . 
Since 1977 , Gallup International has asked people around the world whether they believe their lives will be better next year than they were the year before . 
For 2014 , almost 50 % of those surveyed said that their lives will be better , with just 20 % saying they will be worse off . 
Yet , asked for their opinion of how the world economy will fare , the score is almost even , with 32 % believing that it will be better , and 30 % that it will be worse . 
So it is worth stepping back and recognizing that many indicators point to a world that is improving . 
New data from the World Bank show that the proportion of extremely poor people has more than halved over the last 30 years , from 42 % of the global population in 1981 to 17 % in 2010 . 
While 1.2 billion people in the developing world still live on less than $ 1.25 per day - a problem that we certainly must address - the rate of extreme poverty has never been lower . 
Economists estimate that in 1820 , more than 80 % of all people were extremely poor . 
Similarly , consider the amazing improvements in education . 
Illiteracy today still afflicts 20 % of the world &apos;s population , but that is down sharply from an estimated 70 % in 1900 . 
In the prosperous West , rapid increases in literacy were achieved early in the twentieth century . 
In developing countries , similarly large ( and continuing ) gains were made from 1970 to 2000 , with China recording the biggest improvement . 
The costs of poor education are substantial . 
For example , Pakistan and South Korea started with about the same level of education and income in 1950 . 
Today , the average South Korean has 12 years of education , whereas the average Pakistani has fewer than six . 
South Korea &apos;s per capita income grew 23-fold over this period , compared to Pakistan &apos;s three-fold growth . 
Together with the Copenhagen Consensus , economists have attempted to assess the cost of illiteracy . 
We estimate that if there had been no illiteracy in 1900 , the world would have been $ 240 billion richer ( in inflation-adjusted terms ) , equivalent to about 12 % of global GDP at the time . 
So , the global illiteracy problem in 1900 can be said to have cost the world 12 % of GDP . 
Today , the cost of global illiteracy is down to 7 % of GDP . 
By 2050 , when illiteracy will reach about 12 % , the cost will have dwindled to just 3.8 % of GDP . 
Likewise , war carries a high economic and human cost . 
But , while the images of it that we see are more immediate and vivid than ever , our perception of ubiquitous conflict is wrong . 
In the twentieth century , conflict killed 140 million people , including 78-90 million in the two world wars . 
The good news , which is not often publicized ( precisely because it is good ) , is that scenarios in which military spending is higher , the same , or lower in the future suggest that the high military costs of the twentieth century have been turned into what looks like a permanent peace dividend . 
World War I cost about 20 % of global GDP , and WWII cost almost twice as much . 
When examining the cost of conflict , the Copenhagen Consensus economists estimate the actual costs of global military expenditure . 
If one also takes into account the lives lost in battle , the estimates increase by about 50 % . 
According to these estimates , annual military costs in the twentieth century averaged about 5 % of GDP . 
Yet , since the Korean War peak of 7 % , global costs have declined steadily , reaching 3.5 % in 1980 and about 1.7 % today . 
Even a pessimistic outlook suggests an increase only to about 1.8 % by 2050 ; under a more optimistic scenario , military costs could decline further , to 1.6 % of GDP . 
There are still plenty of problems in the world , as the news media point out every day . 
And we do need to focus on eliminating poverty , stamping out illiteracy , and promoting peace . 
But we also need to remember that the world is a better place overall than we think .
