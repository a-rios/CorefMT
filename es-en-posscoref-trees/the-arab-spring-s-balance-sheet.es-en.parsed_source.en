The Arab Spring &apos;s Balance Sheet 
CAIRO - Last year &apos;s events in Egypt and Tunisia drew the curtain on a tottering old order and delivered much of the Arab world into a long-awaited new era . But what that new era will look like remains very much an open question , given the many challenges that the region &apos;s countries still face . 
The old order that has begun to vanish extends beyond the former regimes . 
The region &apos;s entire value system - a political culture forged by autocracy - is being transformed . 
Arab men and women have shed the sense of humiliation and inferiority that despotism imposed on them - and that fostered desperation , anger , violence , and insularity . 
This transformation , though far from complete - indeed , it may well last years - has nonetheless started to bear fruit . 
If the 2011 uprisings had not occurred , we would now be witnessing another year of autocracy , with more talk of dynastic successions . 
That would mean further humiliation for ordinary people , who bear the brunt of corruption , as government officials and their crony capitalists continued to siphon off public funds . 
The Arab media would still be heaping uncritical praise on the region &apos;s presidents and their families , while development programs would be looted by them . 
Education would continue to stagnate , and Arab societies , which are divided across sectarian , tribal , and regional lines , would experience rising levels of retribution and violence . 
The infamous &quot; death boats , &quot; on which hundreds of young North African men risked their lives every year in search of employment and a better life abroad , would continue to deliver those who survived the journey onto Europe &apos;s unwelcoming shores . And Arabs &quot; rage would reach unprecedented levels , causing utter mayhem and destruction . 
Arab youth have rescued the Arab world from this fate . 
Their conscientiousness and integrity have restored people &apos;s self-confidence . 
The old regimes &quot; opponents have demonstrated bravery without recklessness , and differences of opinion without bigotry . 
Indeed , we have seen Islamists , liberals , and leftists standing together in defiance . 
We have seen Muslims and Copts protect each other in Cairo . 
In Yemen , we have seen local tribesmen follow a woman , Nobel Peace Prize winner Tawakel Karman , in the fight for freedom . 
And we have seen the Arab media foster a mature debate about democracy , constitutionalism , and the role of Islam in the modern state , rather than dispensing disinformation and crass propaganda . 
But the transformation must not stop here . 
The new and old political forces should initiate a dialogue to create a consensus on the rules of political engagement . 
As the people become their own masters , those who fail to engage in this process will eventually find themselves without political power . 
Other countries in the region , and beyond , should embrace the Arab Spring . 
In particular , the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) should abandon their hesitance to support the post-revolution governments . 
Ultimately , the changes occurring in the Arab world will contribute to the entire region &apos;s economic prosperity and political stability . 
Today , Tunisia and Egypt are experiencing severe economic crises . 
Before Tunisia &apos;s revolution , for example , 500,000 of its labor force of 3.6 million were unemployed , and that number has since risen to 700,000 . 
Egypt has lost roughly $ 9 billion in capital flight in recent months . 
But , according to Egypt &apos;s prime minister , Kamal al-Ganzouri , the country &apos;s Arab &quot; brethren &quot; have delivered only $ 1 billion of the $ 10.5 billion in aid and loans that they promised . 
Moreover , Tunisia and Egypt have so far received none of the $ 35 billion promised by the G-8 countries . 
And , given the current global economic crisis , the funds are not likely to be forthcoming in the near future . 
The region &apos;s emerging democracies urgently need an Arab initiative that resembles the Marshall Plan - a program to attract large-scale investment in infrastructure , industry , and agriculture ( and in the region &apos;s wealth of untapped technical skills ) , thereby boosting employment . 
The initiative should also encourage free movement of goods and people within the region , by lifting the customs restrictions and complicated procedures that hinder bilateral and multilateral trade . 
Creating regional development banks and building a Mediterranean express railway from Alexandria to Rabat would serve this goal . 
But long-term investments will not solve the immediate crisis . 
Egypt and Tunisia need immediate cash deposits and grants , and their newly elected leaderships should not be forced to resort to begging . 
In the past , the Gulf countries have supported Egypt and Tunisia . 
It is now in the GCC &apos;s best interests to support them again as they make the transition to freedom . 
Meanwhile , the United States and the European Union should recognize the nature and depth of the unfolding changes . 
The Arab public is fully aware of the close alliances that existed between the West and the now-defunct despotic regimes , yet they have exhibited no desire for vengeance or retribution towards the West . 
It is past time for the West to accept the Arab people &apos;s will and to stop exaggerating the repercussions of change . 
The West must support genuine democracy in the Arab world . 
If the Arab Spring is aborted , the result will be not dictatorships that are loyal to the West , but rather , a tsunami of rage that will spare no one . 
There is nothing more dangerous than aborted dreams , especially when those dreams may be the last chance for change .
