Time to Confront Chávez 
MEXICO CITY - In early September , Colombia &apos;s biggest businesses surprised everyone by declaring their wholehearted support for the country &apos;s president , Alvaro Uribe , in his deepening conflict with Venezuela . 
If they lost the huge export market next door , well , that would simply be too bad . 
For the first time , Colombian exporters of just about everything Venezuela buys , from toilet paper to gasoline , fruit and vegetables , and milk and meat , gave their president the green light to confront Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , instead of continuing to turn the other cheek , as they had been pressing him to do in the eight years since Uribe took office . 
Venezuela had become a magnificent business opportunity for Colombian exporters . 
While Colombia &apos;s authorities were forced to deal with Chávez &apos;s frequent insults , interventions in Colombia &apos;s internal affairs , massive arms purchases , and diplomatic tantrums , the business community profited and pressured the government to compromise . 
Until now , that is what the government did . 
The hesitation of Colombia &apos;s business community to confront Chávez may prove to have been the last remaining hurdle for Uribe , the United States , and a handful of Latin American democracies to clear before they could face up to Chávez . 
It is past time that they did . 
The Venezuelan lieutenant colonel has repeatedly provided sanctuary , arms , diplomatic support , and financing to the FARC guerrillas fighting to overthrow the Colombian government . 
He has engaged in immense arms purchases from Russia , Ukraine , and Belarus , most recently including tanks , fighter planes , and a submarine . 
He has increasingly clamped down on dissent , the opposition , and basic freedoms in Venezuela , as well as expropriating business concerns without compensation . 
By systematically supporting his allies in other Latin America countries , from Bolivia and Argentina to Honduras and El Salvador , and including Peru , Nicaragua , Ecuador , and Mexico &apos;s opposition , Chávez has polarized the entire Latin American continent in the same way that he has his own society . 
Moreover , he has implicated Venezuela in global conflicts half a world away , by allying himself with the Iranian regime and becoming one of its bulwarks . 
In the face of all this , no one has yet attempted to stop Chávez . 
What &apos;s more , Uribe himself seems tempted to continue to search for compromises . 
Aside from protecting Colombian business interests , he seeks to amend his Colombia &apos;s constitution so that he can run for a third term in office - exactly what Chávez has done in Venezuela , and what his allies in Bolivia , Ecuador , Argentina ( indirectly ) , and Nicaragua have all sought . 
Uribe may still back down , though he is leaving himself precious little wiggle room to decline re-election after all that his supporters have done to allow it . 
Most Colombians would like the immensely popular Uribe to stay in office for another four years . 
US President Barack Obama finds himself in both of these categories . 
He cannot criticize Chávez &apos;s eternal presidency without hitting Uribe ; and it will prove almost impossible for Obama to win Congressional renewal of Plan Colombia , the drug-enforcement and counter-insurgency program launched by Bill Clinton in 1999 , let alone ratification of Colombia &apos;s free-trade agreement with the US , if Uribe can be portrayed by American critics as a perpetual violator of human rights intent on remaining in power indefinitely . 
It would not be easy for Uribe to resist a direct appeal from Obama to step down after two terms . 
For that reason , there might be a basis for a deal : Uribe offers not to run again if Obama begins to confront Chávez the way he should be opposed : diplomatically , politically , ideologically , and in the court of world opinion and international law . 
Only with active US backing can Colombia take its case to the Organization of American States ( where it would currently lose ) , to the United Nations ( where it might win ) , and to friends and allies in Europe and Asia ( where it would undoubtedly have the upper hand ) . 
The case against Chávez is solid if it is properly presented - as a series of repeated violations of domestic , regional , and international commitments and covenants signed and ratified by Venezuela . 
Whether these violations involve shutting down TV stations , imprisoning and exiling opponents , arming guerrillas in neighboring countries , provoking an arms race in the region , or flirting with Iran &apos;s nuclear enrichment program , they all can be proved and denounced . 
If Colombia and Obama proceed in this fashion , their potential allies in the rest of the 
Countries like Mexico , Peru , Chile after its December election , Costa Rica , and the Dominican Republic all worry that if they confront Chávez , they will not only , in certain cases , lose his largesse , but also provoke him into meddling in their domestic politics . 
Letting matters drift toward greater confrontation is not a sustainable policy for Colombia , the US , or the rest of Latin America . 
Such a course would allow Venezuela to choose the next conflict , postponing a showdown until deteriorating circumstances make conflict both inevitable and more dangerous . 
It is now time for Obama to emulate Colombia &apos;s business community and stop turning the other cheek .
