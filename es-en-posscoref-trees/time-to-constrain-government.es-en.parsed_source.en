Time to Constrain Government 
PALO ALTO -The current financial crisis in Europe providesa unique update to Lenin &apos;s dictum that nothing so destabilizes a country as a run on its currency . 
In today &apos;s EU , nothing so destabilizes a currency union as a flight from a member &apos;s sovereign debt . 
The turmoil from the Greek debt crisis and concern over analogous problems in Ireland , Portugal , Spain , and Italy have spread fears about the stability of European banks , the global financial system , the eurozone , and the global economy . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently echoed these fears in public and added worries over whether the euro will survive the crisis . 
The â‚¬ 750 billion ( almost $ 1 trillion ) bailout package from the EU , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund provided only a brief respite in international markets . 
This has now given way to a more sober analysis of the crisis and the efficacy of the response . 
The bailout is no solution to the fundamental problems that the eurozone confronts ; at best , it buys time to spread the inevitable wrenching adjustments over time and across people . 
And it carries its own serious risks of moral hazard and the loss of the ECB &apos;s credibility and independence . 
The fundamental problem for Greece is its bloated fiscal commitments , enabled by lower borrowing costs when it joined the euro . 
But the problems are not limited to Greece - or even to the other countries on the eurozone &apos;s periphery . 
Fiscal folly is widespread throughout Europe and much of the rest of the world . 
If Greece paid no interest on its debt and regained full employment , its fiscal deficit would still be an astounding 6 % of GDP , but the corresponding figures elsewhere are similar , if not worse : 8 % for Ireland , 5.6 % for Spain , 6.8 % for Great Britain , and 7.5 % for the United States . 
Some argue that the only way to save the euro is for monetary union to be followed by fiscal union . 
Their recipe is for the high-tax , high-social-spending ( and not-so-small deficit ) policies of the large northern European economies , Germany and France . 
But that would be a big mistake . 
What is needed are constraints on fiscal policy by each country , not a supranational fiscal authority . 
The problem plaguing many advanced democracies , in Europe and elsewhere , is rising government spending , taxes , and public debt , all of which gravely threaten economic growth . 
In response to this trend , the IMF urges a return to pre-crisis debt-to-GDP ratios . 
Otherwise , the vast explosion of public debt will permanently depress per-capita growth by one-third or more in most advanced economies - a stunning permanent stagnation - and would hamstring governments &quot; ability to combat the next recession . 
But to return to the pre-crisis safety zone will require a decade of large primary budget surpluses ( excluding interest payments ) of roughly 4 % of GDP for the US , 3 % for the eurozone ( higher for higher-debt countries ) , and 7 % for Japan . 
The fundamental lessons of the Greek debt fiasco are not new : 1 ) elected officials systematically ignore long-run costs to achieve short-run benefits ; 2 ) they wait to act until they are forced ; 3 ) government policies cannot circumvent the laws of economics ; 4 ) governments cannot revoke the laws of arithmetic ; and 5 ) budget policy is not merely accounting . 
When a government borrows a euro ( or a dollar , pound , peso , or yuan ) , it commits itself to pay a euro in present value of future interest payments and eventual repayment of principal . 
That money must come from higher taxes , from eroding the real value of money balances and government debt through inflation , or from outright default and debt restructuring . 
The eventual costs of any of these actions are severe . 
Moreover , the problem is not just one of public debt . 
A much higher ratio of taxes to GDP only trades a deficit problem for more sluggish economic growth . 
In recent decades , the large advanced economies with the highest taxes have grown most slowly . 
And the higher-tax economies did not even have smaller budget deficits than the lower-tax US ; rather , higher taxes merely enabled higher spending . 
Will a new Stability and Growth Pact , with eurozone members assessing the fiscal policies of their peers , solve these problems ? 
IMF consultations and evaluations have had little impact outside of economies that are heavily dependent on IMF programs . 
Citizens and local politicians will not outsource their policies to neighbors or international organizations unless forced to do so by strict bond covenants . 
So it would be far better for each country to enact serious legal constraints on its legislators &quot; budget authority . 
Restrictions on budget deficits are a start , but are not sufficient . 
The immense growth of the welfare state and soaring public deficits and debt have become the major source of systemic economic risk at both the national and global level . 
Simultaneous restrictions on spending , taxes , and debt are thus required to avert future economic and financial crises . 
Analogous rules for federal budgeting were somewhat helpful in the US in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , but were abandoned in 1998 . 
Future legislatures cannot be completely bound by such rules unless they are embedded in constitutions . 
The constitutional balanced-budget rules ( for operating budgets , with borrowing allowed for capital spending such as school construction ) found in many US states have by and large worked well , and Germany has recently moved in this direction . 
These rules include appropriate temporary safety valves for recession , and some have super-majority voting requirements . 
Sensible rules promise big payoffs , given the current and long-term global crisis in public finances . 
The problem is not that governments lack resources to spend , but that higher government spending , taxes , and debt are eroding economic growth and future living standards . 
Such a future seems to be on the horizon not only in Europe , but everywhere , unless governments rein in their spending .
