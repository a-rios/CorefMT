Germany &apos;s Economic Mirage 
LONDON - For 60 years , successive German governments sought a more European Germany . 
This is politically unwise and economically dangerous . 
Far from being Europe &apos;s most successful economy - as German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble and others boast - Germany &apos;s economy is dysfunctional . 
To be sure , Germany has its strengths : world-renowned companies , low unemployment , and an excellent credit rating . 
Its &quot; beggar-thy-neighbor &quot; economic model - suppressing wages to subsidize exports - should not serve as an example for the rest of the eurozone to follow . 
Germany &apos;s economy contracted in the second quarter of 2014 , and has grown by a mere 3.6 % since the 2008 global financial crisis - slightly more than France and the United Kingdom , but less than half the rate in Sweden , Switzerland , and the United States . 
Since 2000 , GDP growth has averaged just 1.1 % annually , ranking 13th in the 18-member eurozone . 
Written off as the &quot; sick man of Europe &quot; when the euro was launched in 1999 , Germany responded not by boosting dynamism , but by cutting costs . 
Investment has fallen from 22.3 % of GDP in 2000 to 17 % in 2013 . 
Infrastructure , such as highways , bridges , and even the Kiel Canal , is crumbling after years of neglect . 
The education system is creaking : the number of new apprentices is at a post-reunification low , the country has fewer young graduates ( 29 % ) than Greece ( 34 % ) , and its best universities barely scrape into the global top 50 . 
Hobbled by underinvestment , Germany &apos;s arthritic economy struggles to adapt . 
Despite former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder &apos;s labor-market reforms , it is harder to lay off a permanent employee in Germany than anywhere else in the OECD . 
Germany languishes in 111th place globally for ease of starting a business , according to the World Bank &apos;s Doing Business rankings . 
Its largest firms are old and entrenched ; it has produced no equivalent of Google or Facebook ; and the service sector is particularly hidebound . 
The government has introduced fewer pro-growth reforms over the past seven years than any other advanced economy , according to the OECD . 
The brunt of the stagnation has been borne by German workers . 
Though their productivity has risen by 17.8 % over the past 15 years , they now earn less in real terms than in 1999 , when a tripartite agreement among the government , companies , and unions effectively capped wages . 
Business owners might cheer , but suppressing wages harms the economy &apos;s longer-term prospects by discouraging workers from upgrading skills , and companies from investing in higher-value production . 
Wage compression saps domestic demand , while subsidizing exports , on which Germany &apos;s growth relies . 
The euro , which is undoubtedly much weaker than the Deutschmark would have been , has also helped , by reducing the prices of German goods and preventing France and Italy from pursuing currency depreciation . 
Until recently , the euro also provided booming external demand in southern Europe , while China &apos;s breakneck industrial development raised demand for Germany &apos;s traditional exports . 
But , with southern Europe now depressed , and China &apos;s economy decelerating and shifting away from investment spending , the German export machine has slowed . 
Its share of global exports fell from 9.1 % in 2007 to 8 % in 2013 - as low as in the &quot; sick man &quot; era , when Germany was struggling with reunification . 
Because cars and other exports &quot; made in Germany &quot; now contain many parts produced in central and eastern Europe , Germany &apos;s share of global exports is at a record low in value-added terms . 
German policymakers pride themselves on the country &apos;s vast current-account surplus - € 197 billion ( $ 262 billion ) as of June 2014 - viewing it as a sign of Germany &apos;s superior competitiveness . 
Why , then , are businesses unwilling to invest more in the country ? 
External surpluses are in fact symptomatic of an ailing economy . 
Stagnant wages boost corporate surpluses , while subdued spending , a stifled service sector , and stunted start-ups suppress domestic investment , with the resulting surplus savings often squandered overseas . 
The Berlin-based DIW institute calculates that from 2006 to 2012 , the value of Germany &apos;s foreign portfolio holdings fell by € 600 billion , or 22 % of GDP . 
Worse , rather than being an &quot; anchor of stability &quot; for the eurozone , as Schäuble claims , Germany spreads instability . 
Its banks &quot; poor approach to lending their surplus savings inflated asset-price bubbles in the run-up to the financial crisis , and have imposed debt deflation since then . 
Nor is Germany a &quot; growth engine &quot; for the eurozone . 
In fact , its weak domestic demand has dampened growth elsewhere . 
As a result , German banks and taxpayers are less likely to recover their bad loans to southern Europe . 
Given how bad wage compression has been for Germany &apos;s economy , foisting wage cuts on the rest of the eurozone would be disastrous . 
Slashing incomes depresses domestic spending and makes debts even less manageable . 
With global demand weak , the eurozone as a whole cannot rely on exports to grow out of its debts . 
For struggling southern European economies whose traditional exports have been undercut by Chinese and Turkish competition , the solution is to invest in moving up the value chain by producing new and better products . 
Germany &apos;s economy needs an overhaul . 
Policymakers should focus on boosting productivity , not &quot; competitiveness , &quot; with workers being paid their due . 
The government should take advantage of near-zero interest rates to invest , and encourage businesses - especially start-ups - to do likewise . 
Finally , Germany should welcome more dynamic young immigrants to stem its demographic decline . 
This would be a better economic model for Germany . 
It would also set the right example for the rest of Europe .
