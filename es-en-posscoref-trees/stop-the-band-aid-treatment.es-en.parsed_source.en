Stop the Band-Aid Treatment 
The Middle East is a tinderbox , with some key players on all sides waiting for every opportunity to destroy their enemies with bullets , bombs and missiles . 
One of the special vulnerabilities of Israel , and a repetitive cause of violence , is the holding of prisoners . 
Militant Palestinians and Lebanese know that a captured Israeli soldier or civilian is either a cause of conflict or a valuable bargaining chip for prisoner exchange . 
This assumption is based on a number of such trades , including 1,150 Arabs , mostly Palestinians , for three Israelis in 1985 ; 123 Lebanese for the remains of two Israeli soldiers in 1996 ; and 433 Palestinians and others for an Israeli businessman and the bodies of three soldiers in 2004 . 
This stratagem precipitated the renewed violence that erupted in June when Palestinians dug a tunnel under the barrier that surrounds Gaza and assaulted some Israeli soldiers , killing two and capturing one . 
They offered to exchange the soldier for the release of 95 women and 313 children who are among almost 10,000 Arabs in Israeli prisons , but this time Israel rejected a swap and attacked Gaza in an attempt to free the soldier and stop rocket fire into Israel . 
The resulting destruction brought reconciliation between warring Palestinian factions and support for them throughout the Arab world . 
Hezbollah militants in south Lebanon then killed three Israeli soldiers and captured two others , and insisted on Israel &apos;s withdrawal from disputed territory and an exchange for some of the several thousand incarcerated Lebanese . 
With American backing , Israeli bombs and missiles rained down on Lebanon . 
Soon , Hezbollah rockets supplied by Syria and Iran were striking northern Israel . 
It is inarguable that Israel has a right to defend itself against attacks on its citizens , but it is inhumane and counterproductive to punish civilian populations in the illogical hope that somehow they will blame Hamas and Hezbollah for provoking the devastating response . 
The result instead has been that broad Arab and worldwide support has been rallied for these groups , while condemnation of both Israel and the United States has intensified . 
Israel belatedly announced , but did not carry out , a two-day cessation in bombing Lebanon , responding to the global condemnation of an air attack on the Lebanese village of Qana , where 57 civilians were killed and where 106 died from the same cause 10 years ago . 
As before there were expressions of &quot; deep regret , &quot; a promise of &quot; immediate investigation &quot; and the explanation that dropped leaflets had warned families in the region to leave their homes . 
The urgent need in Lebanon is that Israeli attacks stop , that Lebanon &apos;s regular military forces control the southern region of the country , that Hezbollah cease as a separate fighting force , and future attacks against Israel be prevented . 
Israel should withdraw from all Lebanese territory , including Shebaa Farms , and release the Lebanese prisoners . 
Yet Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has rejected such a cease-fire . 
Tragically , the current conflict is part of the inevitably repetitive cycle of violence that results from the absence of a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East , exacerbated by the almost unprecedented six-year absence of any real effort to achieve such a goal . 
Leaders on both sides ignore strong majorities that crave peace , allowing extremist-led violence to preempt all opportunities for building a political consensus . 
Traumatized Israelis cling to the false hope that their lives will be made safer by incremental unilateral withdrawals from occupied areas , while Palestinians see their remnant territories reduced to little more than human dumping grounds surrounded by a provocative &quot; security barrier &quot; that embarrasses Israel &apos;s friends and fails to bring safety or stability . 
The general parameters of a long-term , two-state agreement are well known . 
There will be no substantive and permanent peace for any peoples in this troubled region as long as Israel is violating key UN resolutions , official American policy and the international &quot; road map &quot; for peace by occupying Arab lands and oppressing the Palestinians . 
Except for mutually agreeable negotiated modifications , Israel &apos;s official pre-1967 borders must be honored . 
As were all previous administrations since the founding of Israel , US government leaders must be in the forefront of achieving this long-delayed goal . 
A major impediment to progress is the US administration &apos;s strange policy that dialogue on controversial issues will be extended only as a reward for subservient behavior and will be withheld from those who reject US assertions . 
Failure to address the issues and leaders involved risks the creation of an arc of even greater instability running from Jerusalem through Beirut , Damascus , Baghdad and Tehran . 
The people of the Middle East deserve peace and justice , and we in the international community owe them our strong leadership and support .
