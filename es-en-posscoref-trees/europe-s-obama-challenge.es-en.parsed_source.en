Europe \ u0027s Obama Challenge 
PARIS - Will the year 2009 and the beginning of Barack Obama &apos;s presidency mark the beginning of a new era in transatlantic relations , or will the old divisions linger , nurtured by the depth and gravity of the economic crisis ? 
Will the crisis lead to nationalistic and selfish attitudes on both sides of the Atlantic , stymieing the long-awaited rapprochement , if not a full reconciliation ? 
It is , of course , too early to tell . 
Even if the left wing of the European left - like the most liberal of America &apos;s Democrats - voices concerns that Obama has selected a far too centrist cabinet , a classical form of anti-Americanism is bound to recede in Europe . 
It is very unlikely that Europeans will take to the streets to denounce the &quot; essence &quot; of the United States - what America is as much as what America does - as they did during the Bush era and even during the Clinton years . 
America &apos;s image in Europe has changed profoundly since November 4 , and the style of Obama &apos;s diplomacy once he becomes president will probably confirm that change . 
Yet in the realm of transatlantic relations , as is true globally , it is unwise to expect too much from a single man , whatever his exceptional qualities . 
Fundamental problems remain , and new ones are likely to emerge . 
First , whatever the brutal style of the new Russia under Vladimir Putin and Dmitri Medvedev , the Soviet Union no longer exists and no longer constitutes the common threat that was the &quot; glue &quot; of the Alliance until 1989 . 
Unless something very wrong happens , a new cold war is not about to start . 
During the Cold War , Europe was America &apos;s first line of defense . 
In the current global age , Asia , the Middle East , and even maybe Africa will constitute greater priorities for the US . 
Third , even if America under Obama praises and even practices multilateralism , Americans are far from ready to accept the reality of a multi-polar world . 
They may write about it conceptually , but its meaning - a world in which their country is only &quot; primus inter pares &quot; - has not really penetrated the national psyche . 
America &apos;s internationalism remains grounded in the idea of American &quot; exceptionalism &quot; - a unique role and sense of mission . 
It is an approach to the world with which Europeans have great difficulty coming to terms . 
Even with Obama as president , they may be quick to denounce the combination of arrogance and hypocrisy that they see as linked to America &apos;s view of her &quot; special and unique mission . &quot; 
Fourth , if US diplomacy changes in style and content , will Europe be ready to face the challenge when America calls for help ? 
One early test is likely to be Afghanistan , when a smiling but firm Obama turns to Europe and says directly : &quot; You have backed me in immense numbers . 
I need the further engagement of your troops in Afghanistan ! &quot; 
I suspect that European leaders will not respond eagerly . 
Most are convinced that there is no military solution in Afghanistan and they know that public opinion , especially in time of great economic hardship , has no appetite for such operations . 
Europeans have a traditional tendency to denounce American military adventurism while relying on the US as their protector . 
Fifth , to these &quot; old &quot; problems one must add a new one : the likely impact on transatlantic relations of the worst financial crisis in decades . 
Protectionism in the classical sense of the term is unlikely . 
We have learned the lessons of 1929 . 
The temptation to &quot; appease &quot; suffering populations with populist , selfish measures may grow as the crisis deepens . 
Paradoxically , too , the &quot; greening &quot; of America - an America that discovers late but with passion its responsibility for the planet &apos;s survival - may lead to a competitive transatlantic race for first prize in ecological good behavior . 
And one could multiply the subjects of possible tensions , from nuclear disarmament - too much for the French , too little for many others - to the best ways to deal with Iran , Russia , and China . 
The essential issue lies elsewhere . 
For Europe , the election of Barack Obama is a crucial test . 
Will Europe rise to the occasion and seize the opportunity created by America &apos;s daring and exhilarating choice to prove to itself and to the world that the old continent can exist as a power and a united actor ?
