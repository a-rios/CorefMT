Counting Iraqi Casualties 
In times of war , accurate figures on the civilian death toll are almost always hard to come by . 
With few exceptions , demographers and epidemiologists have not applied their expertise to making rigorous , credible estimates of civilian mortality and morbidity . 
Sometimes , a lack of professional freedom prevents those who may be most familiar with the data - for example , analysts whose livelihoods depend on the government ( s ) involved in the conflict - from using their expertise for purposes that could be politically damaging . 
But there are other challenges as well . 
Isolating the conflict &apos;s impact from that of other interventions ( e.g. , economic sanctions ) may be impossible . 
Moreover , the high-quality population data needed for credible estimates may not be available due to their &quot; sensitive nature , &quot; or because they never have been collected ( sometimes the case in developing nations ) , or because refugee movements have made data obsolete . 
As a result , the degree of uncertainty in such estimates may be unacceptably high , making them of little real worth . 
Consider the different approaches that have been used to examine the Iraq war . 
The Iraq Body Count aims to tally only deaths from violence during the current war by creating a data set based on media reports . 
If there is no double counting , and if the incidents included in the data were reported correctly , their tally represents a minimum number , because media reports may not be comprehensive . 
Another approach estimates the total change in mortality that the war caused ( including deaths due to the war &apos;s direct and indirect effects ) by calculating the change in the death rate from the pre-war period . 
This requires data upon which to base the rise in mortality , usually derived by conducting a household survey on a random sample of the population . 
Typically , interviewers ask the head of the household to disclose the number and demographic characteristics of pre-war household members , whether any of the people in the pre-war household had died between the pre-war period and the time of the survey , and the date of any household member &apos;s death . 
If household surveys are carried out properly , the number of excess deaths during the war can be estimated within a range of statistical uncertainty . 
But , when conducted during wartime , risks abound . 
Aside from the risks to interviewers collecting such data during a conflict , these include the selection bias of households in the sample , a lack of credible population data to which to apply the changed mortality rates , and mistaken or misleading accounts by participants . 
The survey approach was used twice by a group of researchers based primarily at Johns Hopkins University , who published their results in the medical journal The Lancet . 
Their estimates have been lauded , but also questioned because of their misinterpretation of their own figures . 
For example , in a summary of the 2004 study , they wrote , &quot; Making conservative assumptions we think that about 100,000 excess deaths , or more , have happened since the 2003 invasion of Iraq . &quot; 
But the first study yielded very imprecise estimates of the number of deaths , which the authors glossed over . 
They should have said , &quot; We can say with 95 % certainty that between 8,000 and 194,000 excess Iraqi deaths occurred during the period . &quot; 
The group essentially repeated the study in 2006 , using a larger sample size . 
Again , the researchers had interviewers administer what resembled a typical survey of a random sample of households . 
Appropriately , at the end of the article in The Lancet , the authors discuss issues that may have resulted in a sample that in fact did not meet the &quot; random &quot; threshold . 
Problems with interpretation also plagued that second effort . 
The authors used crude death rates ( CDR &apos;s ) , which reflect the number of deaths per thousand people , in explaining the rise in mortality . 
But demographers rarely use CDR &apos;s , thinking instead in terms of age- and sex-specific mortality rates , usually summarized as &quot; life expectancy . &quot; 
That being said , the group reported that the CDR increased from 5.5 per thousand people in 2002 to 13.3 per thousand in the post-invasion period ( March 2003-March 2006 ) . 
To put the pre-invasion figure in perspective , consider United Nations Population Division figures , which are generally considered to be of very high quality . 
The UN estimates that Iraq &apos;s pre-invasion CDR was 10 per thousand , not the 5 per thousand estimated from the two studies . 
Comparing internationally , the UN reports that Iran &apos;s CDR in the 2000-2005 period was 5.3 per thousand . 
Prior to the war , most observers thought that the situation in Iraq was considerably worse than in Iran . 
So the pre-war CDR that the two Lancet studies yield seems too low . 
It may not be wrong , but the authors should provide a credible explanation of why their pre-war CDR is nearly half that of the UN Population Division . 
If the pre-war mortality rate was too low and / or if the population estimates were too high - because , for example , they ignored outflows of refugees from Iraq - the resulting estimates of the number of Iraqi &quot; excess deaths &quot; would be inflated . 
More fundamentally , what purpose do these numbers serve ? 
Certainly , after the dust has settled , numbers play a role in evaluating the costs and benefits ( if any ) , of a war . 
But in real time , do the numbers really add to the debate ? 
Do they really provide us with more information than the Iraq Body Count figures provide ? 
Do we have the appropriate context to help us interpret the numbers ? 
The war in Iraq has been exceptionally bloody . 
For now , that is about all that statistics can safely tell us .
