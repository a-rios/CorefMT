Misreading the Global Economy 
PRINCETON - In April 2010 , the International Monetary Fund &apos;s World Economic Outlook offered an optimistic assessment of the global economy , describing a multi-speed recovery strong enough to support roughly 4.5 % annual GDP growth for the foreseeable future - a higher pace than during the bubble years of 2000-2007 . 
But , since then , the IMF has steadily pared its economic projections . 
Indeed , this year &apos;s expected GDP growth rate of 3.3 % - which was revised downward in the most recent WEO - will probably not be met . 
Persistent optimism reflects a serious misdiagnosis of the global economy &apos;s troubles . 
Most notably , economic projections have vastly underestimated the severity of the eurozone crisis , as well as its impact on the rest of the world . 
And recovery prospects continue to depend on the emerging economies , even as they experience a sharp slowdown . 
The WEO &apos;s prediction of a strengthening recovery this year continues the misdiagnosis . 
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s announcement last summer that the ECB would do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to preserve the euro reassured financial markets . 
But , as pressure from financial markets has eased , so has European leaders &quot; incentive to address problems with the eurozone &apos;s underlying economic and political dynamics . 
Easy ECB liquidity is now sustaining a vast swath of Europe &apos;s banking system . 
The eurozone is operating under the pretense that public and private debts will , at some point , be repaid , although , in many countries , the distress now is greater than it was at the start of the crisis almost five years ago . 
As a result , banks , borrowers , and governments are dragging each other into a vicious downward spiral . 
Politicians have exacerbated the situation by doubling down on fiscal austerity , which has undermined GDP growth while failing to shrink government debt / GDP ratios . 
And no decisive policy action aimed at healing private balance sheets appears imminent . 
Moreover , Europe &apos;s problems are no longer its own . 
Europe &apos;s extensive regional and global trade networks mean that its internal problems are impeding world trade and , in turn , global economic growth . 
In 2012 , world trade expanded by only 2.5 % , while global GDP grew at a disappointing 3.2 % rate . 
Periods in which trade grows at a slower pace than output are rare , and reflect severe strain on the global economy &apos;s health . 
While the trauma is no longer acute , as it was in 2009 , wounds remain - and they are breeding new pathologies . 
Unfortunately , the damage is occurring quietly , enabling political interests to overshadow any sense of urgency about the need to redress the global economy &apos;s intensifying problems . 
Against this bleak background , it is easy to celebrate the success of emerging markets . 
After all , emerging and developing economies are growing much faster than the advanced countries . 
But even the world &apos;s most dynamic emerging markets - including China , Brazil , and India - are experiencing a sharp deceleration that cannot be ignored . 
Consider India , where growth is now running at an annualized rate of 4.5 % , down from 7.7 % annual growth in 2011 . 
To be sure , the IMF projects that India &apos;s economy will rebound later in 2013 , but the basis for this optimism is unclear , given that all indicators so far suggest another dismal year . 
The emerging economies &quot; supposed resilience , which has buoyed economic forecasts in recent years , needs to be reassessed . 
Like the advanced economies , emerging economies experienced a boom in 2000-2007 . 
But , unlike the advanced economies , they maintained high GDP growth rates and relative stability even at the height of the crisis . 
This was viewed as powerful evidence of their new economic might . 
In fact , it was largely a result of massive fiscal stimulus and credit expansion . 
Indeed , as the effects of stimulus programs wear off , new weaknesses are emerging , such as persistent inflation in India and credit misallocation in China . 
Given this , the notion that emerging economies will recapture the growth levels of the bubble years seems farfetched . 
Economic forecasts rest on the assumption that economies ultimately heal themselves . 
But economies &quot; powerful self-healing capabilities work slowly . 
More problematic , a misdiagnosis can lead to treatments that impair the healing process . 
Overly optimistic economic projections based on mistaken assessments of the global economy &apos;s ailments thus threaten recovery prospects - with potentially far-reaching consequences . 
In Europe , the banks &quot; wounds must be closed - weak banks must be shut down or merged with stronger banks - before recovery can begin . 
This will require an extensive swap of private debts for equity . 
For the global economy , the malaise reflected in anemic trade growth calls for coordinated fiscal stimulus by the world &apos;s major economies . 
Otherwise , the risk of another global recession will continue to rise .
