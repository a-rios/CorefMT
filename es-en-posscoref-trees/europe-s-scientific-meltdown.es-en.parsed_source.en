Europe &apos;s Scientific Meltdown 
After World War II , most Europeans agreed that scientific research would not only boost their economies , but also deliver greater technological autonomy from the United States and act as a catalyst for social change . 
The British Royal Society advocated creating the German Max Planck Society on the ground that solidarity between international scientific communities could contribute to reconciling former enemies . 
As a result , big projects such as the European Centre for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , and the European Molecular Biology Organization ( EMBO ) , were founded to help unite European research efforts in basic science . 
Today , however , European science is declining in almost all countries ( Sweden , Finland , and Iceland are exceptions ) , wasting existing talent and losing attractiveness for young people . 
On average , a young European scientist working in the US receives 2.5 times more research support than in Europe . 
No surprise , then , that a brain drain has developed . 
Indeed , Europe has only five scientific researchers per 1000 inhabitants , compared to eight in the US and nine in Japan . 
Despite its strong scientific tradition , figures for Central Europe are even worse , and the cost of EU integration is likely to further shift priorities away from science and education . 
Shrinking budgets are also damaging established scientists . 
In the life sciences , for example , foundations find it hard to identify high-level Europeans for awards . 
This is not due to lower scientific quality , but to the higher levels of sustained support available to American group leaders to transform new ideas into discoveries . 
Massive military and health investments by the US government have generated a critical mass of research , which in turn attracts private funding - including from European companies , particularly in the pharmaceutical industry . 
Something similar can and does work in Europe . 
In Finland , for example , ten years of sustained public funding is now catalyzing private investments and fueling regular increases in R D budgets . 
Edith Cresson , a former European Commissioner for Research , once said that , &quot; funding directly nanotechnologies would have been more rewarding than creating CERN . &quot; 
She was wrong : the complexity of modern science does not allow anyone , least of all bureaucrats , to predict where innovation will emerge . 
Public funding of basic research and industrial investments are both needed to achieve long-term technological development . 
Although most national funding agencies lack imagination when it comes to European cooperation , several institutions are aware of Europe &apos;s deteriorating research and the handicaps European scientists face in competition with those in the US and Japan ( and also , increasingly , India and China ) . 
At a meeting organized for November 2005 by the Collège de France , Nobel laureates , science historians , and managers of European universities and research facilities will stress the need for a new science policy , including in the social sciences and humanities , in the presence of ministers and European commissioners . 
Euroscience and the European Science Foundation have also made suggestions aimed at shoring up political will : 
· Establish a European Research Council . This initiative , originally presented by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the magazine Nature , proposes to create a pan-European funding agency to organize international competition in &quot; hard &quot; and &quot; soft &quot; basic science . 
Most national research organizations and the European Commission support the idea , but questions persist : who will provide the budget ( at least € 2 billion is needed , which is roughly half of the increase promised by EU governments to raise R D to 3 % of the GNP in 2010 ) ? 
What mechanisms will ensure the Council &apos;s autonomy , a key condition for basing research awards strictly on scientific quality ? 
· Implement general European training schemes . Large facilities have trained a few generations of genuinely European scientists . 
But they cover only a small range of scientific disciplines ; in most others , education is still overwhelmingly national . 
The Bologne protocol , which aims at harmonizing university training throughout Europe , could prove useful here . 
In parallel , European post-doctoral schemes need reappraisal . 
In the US , such schemes contribute to widespread dissemination of expertise , whereas European laboratories still use them as waiting lines without putting enough emphasis on multinational and multidisciplinary trajectories . 
· Give appropriate recognition , salaries , and autonomy to young scientists . Unfortunately , young scientists are largely viewed as a source of cheap manpower , deterring the best students from embracing scientific careers . 
The new Charter of Scientists now under discussion in the European Commission should improve the situation , by making flexible career tracks compatible with transferable social benefits . 
Europe needs proactive policies to meet the challenges of new research needs ­ - and to take advantage of subsequent job opportunities - in areas like sustainable development , climate change , natural hazards , and public health . 
Creating an international pool of expertise could become an important asset for European universities , while enabling European industries to create new jobs . 
Europe &apos;s science policies should also frame a new deal for developing countries . 
Today , scientific relations between developed and developing countries are unequal ; important genetic discoveries based on Third World diseases provide neither appropriate credit to local scientists nor fair returns to the populations that made them possible . 
Moreover , the North-South gap in public health is a major threat to the future of mankind . 
Europe should seek to make science more user-friendly , both to its own researchers and would-be scientists and those in developing countries . 
Let us hope that Europe &apos;s politicians have the foresight to meet these challenges before European science becomes irreversibly marginalized .
