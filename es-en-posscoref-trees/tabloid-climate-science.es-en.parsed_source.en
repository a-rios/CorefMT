Tabloid Climate Science 
NEW DELHI - The scientists whose research has revealed the extent of global climate change are now getting the tabloid treatment . 
First came the scandal of leaked ( actually hacked ) e-mails at the climate institute of Britain &apos;s East Anglia University . 
Now comes the supposed news that the Himalayan glaciers are not , in fact , retreating , and will therefore not disappear by 2035 . 
The first story was timed to appear just before December &apos;s COP15 climate-change summit in Copenhagen . 
The second is designed to bury whatever hopes still exist for signing a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol . 
Coming one after the other , these inflated scandals have , at least for now , dealt a massive blow to the credibility of the evidence that underpins the battle against global warming . 
But how justified are these attacks , particularly the attacks on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the United Nations body that has set the gold standard for analyzing global climate change ? 
One tell-tale sign is the climate skeptics &quot; contempt for the actual data in the Indian government &apos;s study , which is being used to undermine the IPCC report and the impeccable credentials of the scientist Syed Iqbal Hasnain , the source of the IPCC &apos;s alarming quote on the Himalayas . 
There is also the unholy glee with which they have set about destroying an icon of the anti-global warming movement , the Nobel Laureate R.K Pachauri , by attributing financial motives to his research . 
Hasnain , who is currently conducting a study of the accumulation of black carbon on snow at high altitudes in the Himalayas , is not some egotistical scientist seeking the limelight . 
He was Professor of Glaciology at Jawaharlal Nehru University &apos;s School of Environmental Sciences and a fellow of the Indian Institute of Technology and of Delft Technical University in the Netherlands . 
Between 1995 and 1999 , he chaired a working group on Himalayan Glaciology within the International Commission on Snow and Ice . 
He is also the author of Himalayan Glaciers : Hydrology and Hydrochemistry and scores of scientific papers . 
Hasnain made his remark to the New Scientist in 1999 , only five years after the retreat had reached its peak and only two to three years after the slowdown began - far too soon to say that the trend had changed . The IPCC &apos;s use of his remark may have been rash , but was not misleading because in 2003-2004 , the year before it finalized its fourth report , the changed trend would have been barely perceptible 
What the 2009 report for the Indian Ministry of Forests and Environment actually says is that the average retreat of glaciers , approximately five meters per year since the 1840 &quot; s , when records began to be kept , accelerated sharply between the 1950 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
But the retreat slowed after the mid-1990 &quot; s until , for some of the biggest and best-known glaciers , such as Gangotri and Siachen , it had &quot; practically come to a standstill during the period 2007-2009 . &quot; 
But , the retreat of a glacier &apos;s &quot; snout &quot; is only one of three measures of how glaciers can change . 
The other two are its &quot; mass balance &quot; and the rate at which melt-water is discharged . 
The Himalayan glaciers have not stopped losing mass , although they are losing it at a somewhat slower rate than before . 
Evidence collected on 466 glaciers by the Indian Space Applications Center from 1962 to 2004 shows a 21 % loss of glacier area and a 30.8 % of glacier volume . 
The same study also shows that smaller glaciers are shrinking much more rapidly than larger ones . 
While glaciers that cover more than five square kilometers have lost 12 % of their mass , those under one square kilometer have lost 38 percent . 
Applying the overall ratio of mass lost to area covered , this means that the smallest ( and most numerous ) Himalayan glaciers lost up to 57 % of their mass between 1960 and 2004 . 
What could have caused the glacier snouts to have stopped retreating ? 
One factor could be deposits of dust and black carbon ( collectively called aerosols ) upon the snow , which , up to an accumulation of 400 grams per square meter sharply raises the rate of melting . 
Between 400 and 600 grams , it has no further effect , but when it exceeds 600 grams , it acts as a shield against the sun , and slows down melting . 
Much thicker coatings of aerosols at the lower ends of glaciers might explain the tendency in several glaciers , noted in the Indian report , to become narrower in the middle , forming two distinct parts . 
The slowdown in the retreat of the snout of glaciers could , therefore , be a consequence of the very rapid rise of human population in the hills and desertification caused by overgrazing - purely local factors that boost aerosol levels . 
Only more research focused on the differences between glaciers in heavily populated areas and those in uninhabited ones like Siachen will answer this question definitively . 
What needs to be explored is not the validity of the secular trend , but the nature of the local influences working against it . 
By rushing to apologize for a statement they clearly did not understand , British Secretary for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband and others have impugned not only the honesty of scientists like Hasnain , but also the credibility of science itself .
