Checks and Balances in an EU Constitution 
There is widespread agreement that the EU would benefit from further centralization of internal security , and of elements of foreign and defense policy . 
According to the last Eurobarometer survey of 2001 , 73 % of EU citizens support a common defense and security policy , and two Europeans out of three believe that the EU should have one common foreign policy . 
This high support for centralization of tasks in these areas contrasts with the still lukewarm overall support for the EU as a whole : only 48 % support their country &apos;s membership in the EU . 
But does the EU possess the necessary institutions to make these further steps in integration possible ? 
This is one of the most difficult but relevant questions to be addressed by the convention that will debate Europe &apos;s constitution beginning this March . 
In other policy areas , European integration has meant much more than just policy coordination . 
Transfer of power from EU member states has always been accompanied by institution building , tailoring the institution to the specific policy area over which integration was needed . 
A remarkable feature of this process of integration so far is that it has preserved important dimensions of accountability and control . 
But it is important to appreciate the particular way in which accountability for EU decisions has been preserved , and how it differs from political accountability in a representative democracy . 
In a representative democracy , elections are the ultimate instrument for holding politicians accountable . 
Citizens delegate decisions to representatives ( governments , legislators ) . 
If citizens are not satisfied with the decisions they take , that delegation is not renewed : the previous majority loses the election and is replaced by a new government or a new parliamentary majority . 
This mechanism cannot work in the EU , at least not under the current European constitution . 
Governments are the key decision makers in the Council . 
But they are accountable to citizens at home , in national elections , and they are primarily judged for their domestic performance , not for EU decisions . 
Other EU policymaking bodies ( the European Central Bank or the Commission ) are appointed , not elected . 
Accountability in the EU has , instead , been achieved through methods that are typical of bureaucratic control , not of politics . 
Transfer of power to a EU body has generally been accompanied by a clear operational definition of the policy goals . 
EU policymakers ( the ECB , the Commission , the majority in the Council ) generally have a narrowly defined &quot; mission &quot; : price stability , enforcing the single market , holding prices of agricultural commodities stable . 
This has two advantages : it limits discretion by the EU policymakers , and hence insures that transfer of power is not abused ; it also facilitates post-transfer accountability and control . 
The European Parliament , the media , the Council , can blame or approve of the way in which EU decision-making power has been used . 
Since EU policymakers have a narrow mandate and their decisions are often inspired by external technical criteria , they can be held accountable for their behavior despite the absence of elections . 
This method of bureaucratic control has ( so far ) worked well in the EU . 
It can fruitfully be extended to internal security , where it is possible to define a precise mission for EU policymakers , exploiting the Commission and designing appropriate technical guidelines to achieve clearly defined operational goals . 
The method of bureaucratic control cannot , however , work in the new areas where further centralization is urgently needed : foreign policy and defense . 
What mandate can be given in the realm of foreign policy ? 
The only feasible mandate is to pursue the common interest of the EU . 
But what does that mean in practice ? 
If the mandate is so incomplete that it leaves too much room for discretional judgment , there is only one way to hold policymakers accountable : through democratic elections . 
Only citizens can tell whether policy decisions are really in their interest . 
Unfortunately , this instrument is unavailable at the EU level , or at least it is seriously deficient . 
Naturally , limited forms of cooperation are still possible , in foreign and defense policy , through intergovernmental coordination . 
They should be pursued as far as possible . 
But we should be aware that these forms of cooperation will not take us very far . 
One reason is that both defense and foreign policies rely on well-functioning bureaucracies ( a diplomatic corps , the military ) . 
How can the Council acquire control over such bureaucracies ? 
The Commission , not the Council , is traditionally the bureaucratic arm of the EU . 
Developing a EU bureaucracy in foreign policy is a first step towards having an effective European foreign policy . 
Here , however , the Commission competes with national bureaucracies . 
In the realm of foreign policy , it seems difficult to exploit the traditional vertical links between the Commission and national bureaucracies that instead have worked so well in dealing with national policy issues . 
We are thus left with a fundamental dilemma . 
Europe is now in a situation in which big benefits would come from centralizing foreign and defense policies . 
But in these areas , bureaucratic control cannot work . 
To centralize these policies , a drastic redesign of the EU political constitution might be needed . 
Europe would need to have political institutions more typical of a federation than of a confederation of states . 
It is no coincidence that historical episodes of unification of countries coincided with situations in which external threats or a common enemy created large benefits from centralizing defense and foreign policy . 
But is Europe capable of jumping to much closer forms of political integration at a time when it is trying to enlarge to the East ?
