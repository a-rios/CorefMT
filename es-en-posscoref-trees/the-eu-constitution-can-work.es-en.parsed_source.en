The EU Constitution Can Work 
The final stage in drafting an EU Constitutional Treaty is underway . 
Smaller and bigger EU members seem to be lining up in opposing camps . 
Here Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen offers his hopes for what type of treaty will emerge . 
After the historic decision on enlargement , the European Union now faces the task of making a Union with 25 or more Member States a success . 
That is the task of the Intergovernmental Conference , which started its work on October 4th . 
Governments of the 15 current member states and the 10 new members will negotiate a Constitutional Treaty that will form the framework for European co-operation in the future . 
We aim for a Treaty that can stand for several years without further changes . 
Denmark has a clear goal in these talks : to ensure a strong , democratic and transparent Union . 
The Intergovernmental Conference works on the basis of the draft Treaty presented by the European Convention . 
The Convention &apos;s draft Treaty provides for a more simple and comprehensible structure for the EU based on more democratic and transparent co-operation between member states . 
Indeed , it underlines the fact that the member states are the defining building blocks of the EU and defines the competences of the Union clearly . 
The Intergovernmental Conference should therefore not re-open the main political compromises of the Convention . 
There are , however , a number of questions that need further deliberation . 
This is the case with some of the more technical issues relating to individual policy areas . 
Denmark therefore fully supports the Italian Presidency &apos;s aim to complete the work of the Intergovernmental Conference by the end of the year . 
Like the Italian President , we believe the negotiations should focus mainly on the central institutional questions . 
Denmark &apos;s priorities are clear . 
The new Treaty must fulfil two basic demands : 
it must respect the central role of member states and it must maintain the balance between larger and smaller members ; 
the institutional structure must be efficient , democratic , and transparent . 
The three central institutional questions confronting the Intergovernmental Conference are the future organization of the Commission and the Council , as well as determining the role of the future President of the European Council . 
We must find a solution that realizes the full potential of all three actors . 
Denmark presented a proposal on how to strengthen the organization of the Commission that reflects two considerations . 
On the one hand , the principle of one commissioner per Member State with full voting powers carries great importance to many member states and to many citizens . 
At the same time , we must ensure that the Commission can work effectively with 25 or more members . 
Our proposal seeks to retain the Convention &apos;s idea of limiting the number of portfolios in the Commission while giving all commissioners full voting rights . 
We suggest that the work of the Commission be concentrated in 15-19 portfolios . 
The heaviest portfolios should be shared among a number of commissioners , one of them responsible for coordination . 
This model will ensure an efficient Commission with strong public legitimacy . 
Strengthening the Commission must go hand in hand with strengthening the Council . 
It is not a zero-sum game . 
The Council Presidency , in my view , should remain embedded in the member states . 
With 25 and more members , however , it is necessary to improve the present rotating Presidency ( in particular the lack of continuity ) . 
While being open towards the idea of a &quot; Team Presidency &quot; involving , for example , three countries for a period of one year or eighteen months , I worry that it would make horizontal co-ordination and the smooth daily conduct of business more difficult . 
Therefore , I believe that we should modernize the present rotating Presidency . 
But whether we continue with the current format for the Presidency or introduce a team model , we must consider how the President of the European Council can play a role in coordinating work within the Council . 
The purpose of the European Council Chair is to ensure the coherence and decision-making capacity of the European Council . 
He or she must of course be given the necessary means to perform this task . 
At the same time we must avoid creating a presidential system that functions independently of the Council , the Commission , and the member states . 
But if we do not integrate the President of the European Council into the existing institutional structure and relegate the presidency to presiding over the meetings of the European Council , we will miss an important chance to strengthen the overall decision-making capacity of the Union . 
We also risk creating competing structures that will weaken the institutions as a whole . 
Denmark seeks an ambitious result in the institutional negotiations . 
We wish to strengthen the EU &apos;s ability to solve the problems of the member states . 
In order to accomplish this goal , we owe it to ourselves to create a strong , democratic , and transparent framework for co-operation in an enlarged Union .
