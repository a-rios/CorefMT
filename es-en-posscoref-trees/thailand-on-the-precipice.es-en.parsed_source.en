Thailand on the Precipice 
BANGKOK - The two-month siege of downtown Bangkok by the so-called &quot; Red Shirts &quot; has ended in bloodshed . 
More than 60 people , including two foreign reporters and a few soldiers , died in the Thai army &apos;s suppression of the urban rebellion . 
The Thai government had no choice but to use force after negotiations with the protestors broke down . 
Both sides deeply mistrusted the other , even though the government &apos;s five-point &quot; road map &quot; for a peaceful resolution implicitly acknowledged the existence of serious socioeconomic problems and included an early general election this November - a concession to the protestors , who argue that the government lacks legitimacy because it was never elected . 
Much of Thailand is now under an all-night curfew , imposed after radical Red Shirts set fire to more than 35 landmark buildings in Bangkok . 
The militants &quot; targets included branches of Bangkok Bank , the country &apos;s largest and a pillar of the establishment ; 
Siam Square , owned by the Palace ; and a deluxe shopping mall owned by one of the richest Thai Chinese families . 
That anarchic fury reflected the disappointment of radicals at their leaders for prematurely surrendering to the authorities rather than fighting to their last breath . Those who did not surrender wanted to show their defiance . The fires were also a volcanic outburst of class hatred by the disenfranchised , rural and urban , against the Bangkok-based wealthy ruling class . 
That class is an interlocking network of millionaire generals , big-business owners and their marriage-linked clans , and the Palace , an institution protected by lèse majesté laws that carry severe penalties . 
The ruling elite , whose public face at present is the attractive , mild-mannered , Oxford-educated prime minister , Abhisit Vejjajiva , is pinning all the troubles on one man , former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , exiled abroad and a fugitive from Thai justice . 
In this narrative , Thaksin masterminded the siege by hiring a small group of rogue army officers , and by paying the poor to go to Bangkok to start a civil war . 
It is entirely plausible that Thaksin did help finance the protest . 
It is also likely that some radical hot heads wanted to overthrow the government by mob action . 
That the elite believes this story is one indication of just how condescending and out-of-touch its members are . 
Many in the elite have even turned their ire at foreign news media for allegedly distorting the truth by overplaying the protesters &quot; grievances . 
CNN and BBC have been attacked for their alleged bias in showing the &quot; human side &quot; of the protesters and giving insufficient time to the uglier aspects . 
Both outlets ran live broadcasts throughout the protest , showing all the drama that the cameras could capture . 
While official &quot; spin control &quot; is in full throttle , a growing number of thoughtful analysts are voicing concern that facile caricatures do not serve Thailand &apos;s interests . 
After all , the sense of disenfranchisement among voters in the country &apos;s populous north and northeast , as well as among the urban poor , is real . 
It is not something manufactured by Thaksin . Nor are the peasants so ignorant to be easily conned by a crafty politician promising much delivering little or none . 
This patronizing view conveniently ignores the fact that in the last four elections , Thaksin and his allies won by lopsided margins . 
Thaksin &apos;s rural development policies were clearly welcomed by people who , for the first time , felt connected to the leaders they had elected . 
So the ruling elite engineered a coup to secure the power they had failed to win at the ballot box . 
They then made use of the &quot; Constitutional Court &quot; to ban Thaksin &apos;s party , the largest in the country . 
But , even as it made Thaksin &apos;s party illegal , the Constitutional Court failed to unearth any evidence of widespread violations . 
Instead , it ruled on a minor side issue that many claim was based on a retrospective law . 
Thailand &apos;s Old Boys Club - generals-turned-politicians , political parties backed by tycoons with an eye on fat government contracts , and that unnameable hereditary institution whose only agenda is to maintain its longevity - has misgoverned the country for the past half-century . 
Under its stewardship , one of Asia &apos;s more promising economies has instead become a borderline failed state , enervated by 17 coups since World War II . 
Few who now hold the reins of power in Bangkok could honestly throw the first stones . 
A peaceful resolution of deep-rooted problems requires wise political leadership , as well as recognition that past injustices cannot be redressed all at once . 
The art of politics is about skillful compromises , with no side getting exactly what it considers fair and just . 
But the country &apos;s underclasses must see long-overdue and concrete changes in the right direction - that is , furthering what Thaksin tried to do . 
In fact , Thaksin may well have to be included in any national reconciliation . 
Change is easier promised than accomplished . Unless the ruling elite embrace an honest and earnest effort at national and class reconciliation and soon , Thailand could well descend into a civil war along class lines that would make the turmoil of the past two months in Bangkok seem like a brawl in a bar .
