Development 3.0 
BEIJING - Until the Industrial Revolution , the world was quite flat in terms of per capita income . 
But then fortunes rapidly diverged , with a few Western industrialized countries quickly achieving political and economic dominance worldwide . 
In recent years - even before the financial crisis erupted in 2008 - it was clear that the global economic landscape had shifted again . 
Until 2000 , the G-7 accounted for about two-thirds of global GDP . 
Today , China and a few large developing countries have become the world &apos;s growth leaders . 
Yet , despite talk of a rising Asia , only a handful of East Asian economies have moved from low- to high-income status during the past several decades . 
Moreover , between 1950 and 2008 , only 28 economies in the world - and only 12 non-Western economies - were able to narrow their per capita income gap with the United States by ten percentage points or more . 
Meanwhile , more than 150 countries have been trapped in low- or middle-income status . 
Narrowing the gap with industrialized high-income countries continues to be the world &apos;s main development challenge . 
In the post-colonial period following World War II , the prevailing development paradigm was a form of structuralism : the aim was to change poor countries &quot; industrial structure to resemble that of high-income countries . 
Structuralists typically advised governments to adopt import-substitution strategies , using public-sector intervention to overcome &quot; market failures . &quot; 
Call this &quot; Development Economics 1.0 . &quot; 
Countries that adhered to it experienced initial investment-led success , followed by repeated crises and stagnation . 
Development thinking then shifted to the neoliberal Washington Consensus : privatization , liberalization , and stabilization would introduce to developing countries the idealized market institutions that had been established in advanced countries . 
Call this &quot; Development Economics 2.0 . &quot; 
The results of the Washington Consensus reforms were at best controversial , and some economists have even described the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s as &quot; lost decades &quot; in many developing countries . 
Given persistent poverty in developing countries , bilateral donors and the global development community increasingly focused on education and health programs , both for humanitarian reasons and to generate growth . 
But service delivery remained disappointing , so the focus shifted to improving project performance , which researchers like Esther Duflo at MIT &apos;s Poverty Action Lab have pioneered with randomized controlled experiments . 
I call this &quot; Development Economics 2.5 . &quot; 
But , judging from experience in North Africa , where education improved greatly under the old regimes , but failed to boost growth performance and create job opportunities for educated youth , the validity of such an approach as a fundamental model for development policy is dubious . 
The East Asian and other economies that achieved dynamic growth and became industrialized did not follow import-substitution strategies ; instead , they pursued export-oriented growth . 
Likewise , countries like Mauritius , China , and Vietnam did not implement rapid liberalization ( so-called &quot; shock therapy &quot; ) , which the Washington Consensus advocated ; instead , they followed a dual-track gradual approach ( and often continued to perform poorly on various governance indicators ) . 
Both groups of countries achieved great advances in education , health , poverty reduction , and other human development indicators . 
None of them used randomized control experiments to design their social or economic programs . 
Today , a &quot; Development Economics 3.0 &quot; is needed . 
In my view , the shift from understanding the determinants of a country &apos;s economic structure and facilitating its change is tantamount to throwing the baby out with the bath water . 
Remember that Adam Smith called his great work An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations . 
In a similar spirit , development economics should be built on inquiries into the nature and causes of modern economic growth - that is , on structural change in the process of economic development . 
Development thinking so far has focused on what developing countries do not have ( developed countries &quot; capital-intensive industries ) ; on areas in which developed countries perform better ( Washington Consensus policies and governance ) ; or on areas that are important from a humanitarian point of view but do not directly contribute to structural change ( health and education ) . 
In my book New Structural Economics , I propose shifting the focus to areas where developing countries can do well ( their comparative advantages ) based on what they have ( their endowments ) . 
With dynamic structural change starting from there , success will breed success . 
In our globalized world , a country &apos;s optimal industrial structure - in which all industries are consistent with the country &apos;s comparative advantages and are competitive in domestic and international markets - is determined by its endowment structure . 
A well-functioning market is required to provide incentives to domestic firms to align their investment choices with the country &apos;s comparative advantages . 
If a country &apos;s firms can do that , the economy will be competitive , capital will accumulate quickly , the endowment structure will change , areas of comparative advantages will shift , and the economy will need to upgrade its industrial structure to a relatively higher level of capital intensity . 
So successful industrial upgrading and economic diversification requires first-movers , and improvements in skills , logistics , transportation , access to finance , and various other changes , many of which are beyond the first-movers &quot; capacity . 
Governments need to provide adequate incentives to encourage first-movers , and should play an active role in providing the required improvements or coordinating private firms &quot; investments in those areas . 
Structural change is , by definition , innovative . 
Developing countries may benefit from the advantage of backwardness by replicating the structural change that has already occurred in higher-income countries . 
Based on the experiences of successful countries , every developing country has the potential to sustain 8 % annual growth ( or higher ) for several decades , and to become a middle- or even a high-income country in one or two generations . 
The key is to have the right policy framework in place to facilitate private-sector alignment with the country &apos;s comparative advantages , and to benefit from latecomer advantages in the process of structural change .
