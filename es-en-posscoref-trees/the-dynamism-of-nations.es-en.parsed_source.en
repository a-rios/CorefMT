The Dynamism of Nations 
Proposals for economic reform of Continental Europe keep coming . 
The process does not constitute a unified , reasoned debate so much as an ongoing political auction in which special interests seek votes for the policy change that will benefit them . 
Some say the bar to a good economy is the Continent &apos;s inflated welfare state and the solution is retrenchment , beginning with raising retirement ages . 
Others say the impediment is the entire overgrown public sector and the solution is to cut tax rates . 
The latest view , endorsed by the European Commission , blames a shortage of infrastructure and proposes more bridges and tunnels . 
This approach will never reach the heart of the matter . 
The West &apos;s core social values make high economic performance a moral imperative like free speech or trial by jury . 
Further , the Continent will undoubtedly need some transformative changes of its economic institutions to establish high-performance economies . 
To reach broad agreement on those changes requires facing some basic questions so far ignored . 
A real debate on basic reform has to start with an explicit conception of economic performance - of what constitutes a good business life . 
Productivity is an important element . 
Only a high-productivity economy can promise all or most working-age persons a range of careers at high wage rates . 
But high productivity is not the only element of high performance . 
The other element is thriving , prospering participants . 
This requires jobs to be rewarding in more than pecuniary ways - enlisting the minds of employees , engaging them in problem solving , leading them to discover some of their talents and expanding their abilities . 
This personal growth , while an end in itself , is also a source of job satisfaction , which in turn boosts participation in the labor force , and of high employee loyalty , which lowers unemployment , making more good jobs available . 
What is needed for high performance ? 
Basically , it is productive change , which I call economic dynamism . 
For employees to develop , they must be imbedded in a stimulating workplace , with new problems to solve , harder tasks to be mastered , added abilities to strive for . 
Less obviously , a country does not want misguided or pointless change ; it wants investments that appear to the financial sector as productive . 
The late 1990 &apos;s produced evidence that low dynamism was associated with weak economic performance , particularly low prosperity . 
Of the 12 large OECD economies , three - Germany , Italy , and France - were conspicuously un-dynamic : they missed the 1990 &apos;s investment boom or were awfully late to it . 
These same economies also ranked at or near the bottom in unemployment and labor-force participation , both before the boom and now . 
What are the requirements for dynamism ? 
Yale University &apos;s Robert Shiller has suggested that I believe that Europeans lack dynamism owing to a deficiency of entrepreneurial &quot; spirit . &quot; 
I have pondered the expressed uneasiness of Europeans about making money , and speculated that their schooling might drain away some playfulness and creativity . 
But that is not my explanation of Europe &apos;s problem . 
For one thing , it is hard to decide whether such cultural patterns are causes or effects of dynamic economies . 
My thesis is that the degree of dynamism in a nation &apos;s economy hinges on its development of some key economic institutions - company law and corporate governance , the population &apos;s preparation for business life , the development of financial instruments such as the stock market and so forth . 
Such general institutions as the rule of law and provision of enough personal and national security to safeguard earning , saving and investing are needed for any market economy , even market socialism ; they are insufficient for dynamism . 
Evidence exists for this thesis . 
One could have predicted in advance of the recent boom how the 12 large OECD economies would rank simply by knowing the percentage of the population with a university degree , the OECD index of barriers to entrepreneurs , and the breadth of the stock exchange ( measured by the market value of outstanding shares relative to GDP years before the boom ) . 
This evidence linking employment to dynamism and tracing dynamism to favorable institutions , such as a well-developed stock market , and to obstructive institutions , such as myriad licenses for entry by new firms , is an advance in our understanding of healthy economies . 
It is useful to know that there is vastly more to creating economic dynamism than private property ; and that high unemployment is not to be laid solely to labor market restrictions . 
Is there evidence directly associating high performance - that is , high employment and high productivity - with the presence of institutions believed helpful to dynamism and the absence of those believed harmful ? 
Such evidence emerges even with the small sample of just 12 large OECD economies . 
A cross-country analysis estimates that university education is good for all three elements of economic performance : the employment rate ( relative to the working-age population ) , the unemployment rate ( relative to labor force ) , and labor productivity too . 
Scoring high on the OECD index of barriers to entrepreneurs is bad for all three elements of performance . 
A high level of job protection is bad for productivity but does not have a clear effect on either employment rate or unemployment rate . 
I have suggested that the organizational structure of the Continental economies limits their performance . 
This corporatist structure - labor unions , workers councils , employer confederations , and big banks - facilitates direct interventions in economic decision making to give interest groups protection and veto power . 
In fact , among the 12 large OECD nations , a higher degree of corporatism as commonly measured is loosely associated with lower employment and lower productivity . 
The reason for these negative effects appears to be that high corporatism is strongly correlated with stifled entrepreneurship and obstructive job protection . 
The corporatist structure by itself does not detract from performance . 
Here again , the truth lies in the nuances . 
This is precisely why Europe should be debating about the Continent &apos;s real problems , not locking their economies into corporatism by enshrining the &quot; social market economy &quot; into the emerging EU constitution .
