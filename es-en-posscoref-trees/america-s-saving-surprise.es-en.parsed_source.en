America &apos;s Saving Surprise 
CAMBRIDGE - The household saving rate in the United States has tripled in the past three years . 
Why ? 
And what does it mean for the US economy and the rest of the world ? 
The rapid rise in saving has reduced consumer spending , slowing the pace of GDP growth in 2009 and in early 2010 . 
If the saving rate continues to rise rapidly , it could push America &apos;s fragile economy into another downturn . 
That would mean lower imports , creating a potential problem for countries that depend for their employment on exporting to the US . 
Higher household saving depresses consumption because it is the difference between households &quot; after-tax income and what they spend . 
The saving may be deposited in bank accounts or used to buy mutual funds or corporate stock . 
Saving may also take the form of individual contributions to retirement accounts or employer contributions to corporate saving plans . 
Paying down debt on credit cards or mortgages also counts as saving - but increases in the value of existing assets like stocks or real estate do not , even though they increase the value of household wealth . 
In any year , some households are savers and others , especially retirees , are dissavers that use past saving to finance current consumption . 
The nation &apos;s net household saving rate is the difference between the saving of the savers and the dissaving of the dissavers . 
The recent rise in the US household saving rate reversed a long-term decline that began 25 years ago . 
Before that , between 1960 and 1985 , American households saved an average of 9 % of their after-tax incomes . 
The saving rate in each of those 25 years was between 7 % and 11 % . 
But , after 1985 , a variety of changes caused saving to decline until it reached less than 2 % in 2007 . 
One reason was that rising stock markets and higher house prices made individuals wealthier , reducing their need to save for retirement and allowing retirees to dissave more . 
The general shift from defined-benefit pension plans to defined-contribution plans meant that employees felt the effect of rising share prices directly in their own personal accounts . 
Moreover , the increased availability of credit cards gave Americans a greater ability to dissave , buying goods and services now and paying for them later . 
Mortgages became more widely available . 
Rising house prices also allowed homeowners to refinance their mortgages , obtaining additional cash to spend on other things . 
Credit lines secured by home equity provided another new way to finance spending . 
All of this changed abruptly when the American economy fell into a deep recession at the end of 2007 . 
The stock market dropped sharply . 
Home prices fell 40 % , completely wiping out the equity of one-third of all homeowners with mortgages . 
Household wealth is now $ 10 trillion dollars less than it was before the recession began . 
That fall in wealth means that households must save more to prepare for retirement , and that retirees are not able to dissave as much as they did before . 
Banks and credit-card companies have become much more cautious about extending credit . 
And , with unemployment stubbornly high , many households are saving in order to have additional cash if they should lose their job or be put on shorter hours . 
There is no way to predict what the saving rate will do next . 
Households &quot; need to rebuild wealth , and the lack of access to credit , implies that the saving rate could continue to rise from the 6.4 % recorded in June ( the most recent month for which data are available ) to the 9 % rate that America averaged in the decades before 1985 . 
If that were to happen quickly , total spending could decline , pushing the economy into a double-dip recession . 
But if households instead become optimistic about the pace of recovery , they might choose to cut back on their saving in order to maintain consumption , despite weak earnings . 
Only time will tell . 
Household saving is only one part of net national saving . 
Since after-tax personal income accounts for about 75 % of GDP , a household saving rate of 6 % translates into just 4.5 % of GDP . 
Corporate retained earnings have averaged about 3 % of GDP after allowing for depreciation of existing plant and equipment . 
The combination of household and corporate saving brings total private saving to 7.5 % of GDP . 
Unfortunately , government borrowing to finance its deficit over the rest of this decade is projected to absorb about 5 % of GDP . 
That would leave a net national saving rate of just 2.5 % of GDP . 
Such a low national saving rate would not be sufficient to finance the level of new investment in plant , equipment , and housing that the country needs . 
So , despite the rise in the household saving rate , unless federal government policies change to shrink America &apos;s future budget deficits , the US will continue to be dependent on capital inflows from the rest of the world . 
If that happens , global imbalances will continue to add risk to the global economy .
