Make the UN Stand for Freedom 
For Sweden , my homeland , the United Nations is a sacred cow . 
But today , many Swedes , like others around the world , are having second thoughts . 
Three events incited these doubts . 
The first was the slaughter in Rwanda a decade ago of more than 800,000 people within 100 days - probably the fastest genocide ever . 
The well-documented fact is that Kofi Annan , then the UN &apos;s Deputy Secretary General , ordered UN soldiers in Rwanda not to intervene or protect the victims . 
That Annan , after this enormous failure , was promoted to Secretary General of the UN remains a puzzle . 
Doubts about the UN , and Annan personally , were compounded by the ongoing scandal within the UN administration concerning the Oil for Food program . 
Although reports have so far not implicated Annan directly , his management failures are abundantly clear . 
The third - and perhaps the most disillusioning - scandal concerns the Commission on Human Rights , for it lays bare much about the structural and permanent lack of balance and morality within key UN agencies . 
Most people assume that this Commission exists to promote human rights and democratic freedoms . 
Yet some of the worst human rights violators are Commission members . 
These enemies of freedom are permanently silent about torture , oppression , and mass murder carried out by their fellow dictatorships , but are quick to rant against the world &apos;s democracies , in particular the United States . 
The recent &quot; High Level Panel &quot; report on the future of the UN was right when it said : &quot; We are concerned that in recent years States have sought membership of the Commission not to strengthen human rights but to protect themselves from criticism or to criticize others . &quot; 
So , finally , the truth is emerging . 
After more than a third of a century at the UN , even Annan has come close to admitting that the Commission on Human Rights is a source of shame . 
Is it reasonable to elect a pyromaniac to the board of a fire department ? 
Of course not . 
So why is it that tyrannies like Cuba , China , Saudi Arabia , Sudan , and Zimbabwe are members of this Commission ? 
Recent members also include Libya , Vietnam , Congo , and Syria - the Libyans were even elected chair-country . 
How can this be ? 
About half of today &apos;s UN members are democracies , the other half non-democracies . 
So totalitarian or authoritarian states - more interested in hiding their own oppression than fairly judging other nations - can easily trigger a sort of political pogrom against any democracy that annoys enough tyrants . 
Sadly , many free countries seem utterly indifferent to the ongoing campaign against Israel . 
To prevent such vicious absurdities from continuing , the world &apos;s democracies must unite to prevent any country that systematically violates human rights from being allowed to be a member of the Commission on Human Rights . 
Ongoing democratization in regions that have known only dictatorship provides hope that the balance is tilting in a way that would enable it possible for at least one UN body should incarnate freedom . 
Who should decide if a country is democratic or not ? 
A tremendously respected independent think tank , Freedom House , is , like the UN &apos;s headquarters , located in New York City . 
Political rights and civil liberties are rated between 1 and 7 for each country , with 1 representing the most free and 7 the least free . 
The designation of countries as &quot; free &quot; ( 1-2.5 ) , &quot; partly free &quot; ( 3.0 - 5.0 ) , or &quot; not free &quot; ( 5.5-7.0 ) is determined by combining these ratings . 
Freedom House monitors developments over time and makes its conclusions public in its &quot; Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties . &quot; 
If there is one book that should be compulsory reading for anyone who makes public statements about human rights , this is it . 
So the goal of all free countries should be that only other free countries are allowed seats on the Commission for Human Rights . 
Regimes that are &quot; partly free &quot; or &quot; not free &quot; should never be elected or appointed , for the only governments with the moral legitimacy to review and criticize human rights records are those that came to power through free elections and that can lose power when a new election defeats them . 
Those who have attained power through violence and fraud are not legitimate and should never more shame the UN by being members of this Commission . 
Unfortunately , most democracies are often unwilling to fight against the perversion of the UN Human Rights Commission . 
The European Union represents 25 democracies and often inspires countries to seek their freedom , as it has in Ukraine and Lebanon . 
But the EU &apos;s habit is not to defeat the UN &apos;s extremists , but to make strange compromises with them . 
As a result , rogue states make a few concessions to get the Europeans and others on board and then claim moral parity with the democracies . 
Free peoples everywhere should remember that totalitarian forces and ideas cannot be defeated by being nice and accommodating . 
The Commission on Human Rights must rid itself of members that detest freedom . 
Otherwise , the sole UN agency that concentrates on freedom will be nothing more than a handmaiden to tyranny .
