Of Saints and Servants 
MOSCOW : In July 1918 , the last Tsar , Nikolai II , his family , three servants and a doctor were executed by a Cheka firing squad in a cellar in the Urals city of Ekaterinburg . 
Their bodies were then chopped up , covered in quicklime , burnt , buried , dug up , and buried again in an unmarked pit . 
In the summer of 1998 they were re-buried with honour in Saint Petersburg . 
This summer , the Russian Orthodox Church canonized our last Royal family as martyrs . 
The four servants who died with the Tsar &apos;s family , however , were not canonized . 
Those four could leave ; they could have chosen to go but didn &apos;t . 
They never asked whether their fate was their Master &apos;s fault . 
They never expected benefits or rewards . 
They were faithful until the end and were killed for it . 
Our family , all through the Stalin , Khrushchev , and Brezhnev years , also had servants . 
There were many of them and they carried out different tasks . 
We never called them servants , however ; it was not a polite word . 
When reading tales as a girl about kings and grandees surrounded by servants , my child &apos;s heart wept at those crimes against equality and justice . 
No , the people who lived with us , who cooked for us , who walked the baby carriages , washed windows and cleaned fur-coats in summer time were never called &quot; servants . &quot; 
They had names and would never be asked to carry out dreadful or dangerous tasks . 
The most ancient in our family was Nanny Grusha . 
She was small and light , with white fluffy hair . 
Once , awakened by a nightmare , I shouted for her in panic . 
She sighed , muttered , and noiselessly took her seat nearby my bed . 
Her cheeks gurgled : &quot; psh-sh-sh . &quot; 
Nanny Grusha smelt of lamp oil , soap flakes , and chimney smoke . 
I held her by her dress ; it was a dark-brown dress with small white spots . 
For me , that shade of brown remains the colour of safety . 
The monsters who lived under my bed couldn &apos;t kidnap me so long as Nanny was near . 
In daytime I cried in Nanny &apos;s skirt ; if I was hungry I ran to Nanny . 
Nanny never said : &quot; Eat what is on your plate . &quot; 
She never said : &quot; You must share with others , &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t be greedy . &quot; 
It was my parents who taught me to consider others . 
Nanny never taught . 
Right and wrong were not her tasks . 
She never took anything away from me ; never held somebody up as an example ; never put me to shame . 
If I beat my sister or spat , pulled her hair or took away her toys , Nanny would wait for my storm to blow itself out , then take me to a distant room and feed me sweets and pies , taken from an old pillowcase . 
Nanny had no idea about limits and fairness . 
Hers was not kindness but the pure , strong poison of love . 
For a long time I was sure that &quot; nanny &quot; was a kind of blood relationship . 
You can be &quot; a granny &quot; smelling of perfume and wearing a pearl necklace , but you can also be &quot; a nanny &quot; smelling of smoke and oil and with a cross on a string under your brown dress . 
I once asked Nanny : &quot; Do you believe in God ? 
Stop it now ! 
There is no God ! 
The Cosmonauts haven &apos;t seen anybody up there . &quot; 
Nanny never married ; never had children of her own . 
She raised other &apos;s babies . 
She loved them blindly , greedily , saving them from wind , hunger , monsters , parents and , most of all , other people . 
I noted the chill between my father and Nanny ; they didn &apos;t even say &quot; hello &quot; to each other . 
Nanny loved my mother because my mother was once her baby . 
Sometimes it seemed to me that she would kill anyone who would dare to hurt us . 
Only years after her death did I learn of the crime she committed for us . 
In the days of the Nazi blockade of Leningrad , Nanny took out of the city a sack of flour . 
She did it when Leningrad was dying of hunger , when dead bodies lay everywhere and people ate people . 
She removed a sack of flour from a city where people were killing each other for a crust of bread . 
She went onto the icy Neva river during a bombardment , together with a baby committed to her care - my mother &apos;s 30 year-old brother . 
He was a grown man to everyone but Nanny , always remaining for her a small , pink , frightened , tear-stained child . 
Nanny &apos;s small nephews died from hunger in Leningrad during the siege . 
&quot; I rescued Sergei &quot; - Nanny answered . 
&quot; You abandoned your relatives ? &quot; my Grandmother replied . 
&quot; But I rescued Sergei . &quot; 
She raised my mother &apos;s seven children and five grandchildren and reached a great age without asking anything for herself . I have never loved anyone in the world as strongly as I loved Nanny . No one has loved me as strongly as she . 
I did nothing to deserve her love . 
More : if it were not for her , I would never have known that love is bottomless . 
White hair , brown dress , a crucifix on a string - she was my small guardian angel , given to me for nothing . 
So Russia &apos;s Church blessed the last Tsar but forgot his servants . 
But we should remember who , it is said , will pass through the eye of a needle to find salvation . 
The Moscow Patriarch would likely become stuck in that needle &apos;s eye because of his pearl-encrusted chasubles , his gold and his Mercedes . 
In this hideous century of ours , only beggars and faithful people pass through in the end . 
My sinful and simple Nanny got through , but probably not before stopping for a moment to look back and check one last time at how her children were doing .
