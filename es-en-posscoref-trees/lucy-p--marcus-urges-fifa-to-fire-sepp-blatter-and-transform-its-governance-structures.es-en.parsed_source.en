The Blatterball Diaries 
LONDON - The World Cup has concluded with its usual flourish , and much of the world , as usual , couldn &apos;t help but get caught up in the excitement of it all - which is exactly the outcome that Sepp Blatter wants . 
Blatter , the president of FIFA , the Cup &apos;s organizing body , wants the afterglow of an exciting month of play to blot out the corruption and backroom deals - and , most recently , a ticket scandal - that have roiled his tenure . 
Times were very different in 1998 , when Blatter took up his role . 
Social media did not exist , and the Internet had not yet become a means of spreading the views of the voiceless and disenfranchised . 
Nor was the culture of shareholder activism and corporate social responsibility as strong as it is today . 
As BP , GM , and Royal Bank of Scotland have discovered , the world is watching , talking , and no longer willing to accept the old way of conducting business . 
FIFA has two problems . 
One is a straightforward lack of compliance with accepted business practices . 
Allegations of wrongdoing range from match-fixing and bribery among members of FIFA &apos;s Executive Committee to questions about how Qatar was chosen to host the World Cup in 2022 . 
The second problem is arguably more serious , for it is epiphenomenal : the damage that unethical behavior has done to the ideal of fair play . 
When people see an institution that relates to something that they feel passionate about failing so publicly to abide by simple rules , they lose faith not only in that institution , but also in the idea that good governance is achievable at all . 
The message sent , and understood , is that some institutions - of all kinds - are immune from scrutiny and can play by their own rules . 
The code of conduct on the field - where we expect players to give their all under clear rules that are swiftly enforced by independent referees - is fundamentally the same as what we expect from governing bodies off the field . 
In this sense , FIFA is not a special case : All non-profit and for-profit organizations around the world are expected to abide by this code of conduct . 
And that is why FIFA &apos;s problems are unlikely to fade from view . 
They must be addressed head-on , with a clean sweep of its leadership and a complete overhaul of its governance structures . 
FIFA is as complex as any large multinational private or public organization ; how it is governed must reflect that . 
For starters , FIFA must introduce truly independent board members to the governance process - people who will ask hard questions and challenge the organization &apos;s executives . 
Governance solely by association members has not worked - and , by encouraging a lack of transparency , may have made FIFA more vulnerable to the problems it now faces . 
No organization that holds so much public influence and importance should be able to operate as a black box . 
Likewise , FIFA must introduce and adhere to clearer term limits for its president and board members , starting with Blatter - and with immediate effect . 
More effective checks and balances will not come easily ; but they will not come at all without champions . 
Before the World Cup began , some representatives of FIFA member associations spoke up in opposition to the status quo . 
It will now be seen whether their actions reflect their words . 
There are other glimmers of hope . 
In the world of for-profit companies , investors are increasingly demanding better corporate-governance standards and more diverse boards that include independent members . 
They are taking a much more active and public role in speaking out against bribery , corruption , and excessive pay packages , and in favor of corporate social responsibility and fair labor practices . 
If their calls go unheeded , they vote at the annual general meeting - or with their feet . 
FIFA &apos;s sponsors must hold FIFA similarly to account , and there are signs that some are finally beginning - albeit tentatively - to speak out . 
If they don &apos;t , sponsors will leave themselves exposed to a consumer backlash as FIFA &apos;s poor reputation rubs off on their brands . 
Customers are savvier than ever before , and they , too , can vote with their feet . 
Ultimately , however , change starts at the top . 
Consider what a change in leadership has done for the Roman Catholic Church : Pope Francis is transforming an institution that was thought to be so byzantine , opaque , and intractable that change was all but impossible . 
If the Catholic Church can change , so can the church of football . 
There is another lesson here : good leadership also consists in knowing when to step down . 
If Blatter genuinely cares about FIFA , he knows that remaining there would mean dragging the organization further into disrepute , damaging whatever positive contributions he has made , and quite possibly being forced to leave under a cloud . 
The caption to a picture of Blatter on page six of FIFA &apos;s 2013 financial report reads : &quot; We have reached very high levels of accountability , transparency , and financial control . &quot; 
The problem is that no one believes it . 
FIFA desperately needs to restore its public credibility . 
That can happen only after the necessary changes at the top and throughout the organization have been achieved .
