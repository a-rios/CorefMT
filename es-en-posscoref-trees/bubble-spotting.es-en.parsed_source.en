Bubble Spotting 
NEW HAVEN - People frequently ask me , as someone who has written on market speculation , where the next big speculative bubble is likely to be . 
Will it be in housing again ? 
Will it be in the stock market ? 
I don &apos;t know , though I have some hunches . 
It is impossible for anyone to predict bubbles accurately . 
In my view , bubbles are social epidemics , fostered by a sort of interpersonal contagion . 
A bubble forms when the contagion rate goes up for ideas that support a bubble . 
But contagion rates depend on patterns of thinking , which are difficult to judge . 
Big speculative bubbles are rare events . 
And , because big bubbles last for many years , predicting them means predicting many years in the future , which is a bit like predicting who will be running the government two elections from now . 
But some places appear a little more likely than others to give rise to bubbles . 
The stock market is the first logical place to look , as it is a highly leveraged investment - and has a history of bubbles . 
There have been three colossal stock-market bubbles in the last century : the 1920 &quot; s , the 1960 &quot; s , and the 1990 &quot; s . 
In contrast , there has been only one such bubble in the United States &quot; housing market in the last hundred years , that of the 2000 &quot; s . 
We have had a huge rebound from the bottom of the world &apos;s stock markets in 2009 . 
The S P 500 is up 87 % in real terms since March 9 of that year . 
The rise in equity prices has not come with a contagious &quot; new era &quot; story , but rather a &quot; sigh of relief &quot; story . 
Likewise , home prices have been booming over the past year or two in several places , notably China , Brazil , and Canada , and prices could still be driven up in many other places . 
Conservative government policies will probably reduce subsidies to housing , and the current mood in these markets does not seem conducive to a bubble . 
A continuation of today &apos;s commodity-price boom seems more likely , for it has more of a &quot; new era &quot; story attached to it . 
Increasing worries about global warming , and its effects on food prices , or about the cold and snowy winter in the northern hemisphere and its effects on heating fuel prices , are contagious stories . 
They are even connected to the day &apos;s top story , the revolutions in the Middle East , which , according to some accounts , were triggered by popular discontent over high food prices - and which could themselves trigger further increases in oil prices . 
But my favorite dark-horse bubble candidate for the next decade or so is farmland - and not just because there have been stories in recent months of booming farmland prices in the US and the United Kingdom . 
Of course , farmland is much less important than other speculative assets . 
For example , U.S. farmland had a total value of $ 1.9 trillion in 2010 , compared with $ 16.5 trillion for the US stock market and $ 16.6 trillion for the US housing market . 
But , farmland , at least in certain places , seems to have the most contagious &quot; new era &quot; story right now . 
It was recently booming , up 74 % in real terms in the US in the decade ending with its price peak , in 2008 . 
And the highly contagious global-warming story paints a scenario of food shortages and shifts in land values in different parts of the world , which might boost investor interest further . 
But , from 1911 to 2010 in the US , the correlation between annual real growth of prices for homes and farmland was only 5 % , and the latest data on farm prices have not shown anything like the decline in home prices . 
The housing-price boom of the 2000 &quot; s was little more than a construction-supply bottleneck , an inability to satisfy investment demand fast enough , and was ( or in some places will be ) eliminated with massive increases in supply . 
By contrast , there has been no increase in the supply of farmland , and the stories that would support a contagion of enthusiasm for it are in place , just as they were in the 1970 &quot; s in the US , when a similar food-price scare generated the century &apos;s only farmland bubble . 
Still , we must always bear in mind the difficulty of forecasting bubbles . 
And , for daring investors , it is not enough to find a bubble to pile into . 
They must also try to determine when to cash out and put their money elsewhere .
