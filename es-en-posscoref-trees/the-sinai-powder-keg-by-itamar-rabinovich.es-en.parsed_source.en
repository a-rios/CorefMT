The Sinai Powder Keg 
TEL AVIV- The crisis in the Sinai Peninsula seems to have been dwarfed by Sunday &apos;s drama in Cairo . 
Earlier this month , jihadi terrorists ambushed an Egyptian military base in Sinai , killing 16 Egyptian soldiers . 
They then hijacked two armored personnel carriers and sped toward the frontier with Israel . 
One vehicle failed to break through the border crossing ; the other penetrated Israeli territory , before being stopped by the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) . 
In response , Egypt &apos;s military and security forces launched an offensive against Bedouin militants in Sinai , while Morsi forced the General Intelligence Service &apos;s director to retire and dismissed the governor of Northern Sinai . 
These episodes highlight the complexity of the Middle East &apos;s changing geopolitical landscape , the fragility of Egypt &apos;s post-Mubarak political order , and the explosive potential of Sinai , which , though sparsely populated , includes Egypt &apos;s borders with Israel and the Palestinian enclave of Gaza . 
Indeed , since Hosni Mubarak &apos;s ouster last year , security in Sinai has deteriorated , and the region has become fertile ground for Islamic extremism . 
The 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty mandated that Sinai be largely demilitarized in order to serve as a buffer zone between the two former enemies . 
Tourism and natural-gas pipelines linking the two countries provided economic resources for the local Bedouin . 
But , as Mubarak &apos;s regime declined , so did the government &apos;s control over the Bedouin . 
Palestinian militants from Gaza - an active arena of Israeli-Palestinian confrontation since Hamas gained control in 2007 - and jihadi terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda and the larger &quot; global jihad &quot; network penetrated Sinai , exploiting the government &apos;s neglect of the region and inflaming the local population &apos;s feelings of disenfranchisement . 
Israelis complained about Mubarak &apos;s &quot; cold peace , &quot; but they appreciated that he adhered to the treaty &apos;s fundamental provisions . 
Now the behavior of his successors from the military and the Muslim Brotherhood has revived security challenges and raised difficult questions about the region &apos;s future . 
For example , in August 2011 , a jihadi group from Gaza seized control of an Egyptian outpost on Israel &apos;s border and killed eight Israeli civilians . 
Their objective was to damage further the Israeli-Egyptian relationship , which is already more fragile than ever , and they succeeded : the IDF accidentally killed several Egyptian soldiers during the incident . 
The Egyptian security forces &quot; subsequent failure to prevent demonstrators from storming Israel &apos;s embassy in Cairo brought matters to the brink of calamity . 
The uncertainty and disorder that have plagued Egypt for the last 18 months are fueling increasing lawlessness in Sinai . 
Last month , a pipeline carrying Egyptian natural gas to Israel and Jordan was bombed - the 15th such attack since Mubarak &apos;s regime was toppled - and remains out of commission . 
There are four principal actors in this arena : Israel , Egypt , Hamas , and the Sinai jihadis . 
Israel wants , first and foremost , peace and stability . 
To this end , Israeli leaders expect Egypt &apos;s government to reestablish its authority in Sinai , and , despite the peace treaty &apos;s provisions , have agreed to Egyptian requests to increase its military presence in the region . 
Moreover , Israel has practically abandoned any hope of receiving agreed gas supplies from Egypt , and has not pressed its demand that Egypt block the passage of sophisticated weapons to Gaza . 
Israel is determined not to act against terrorist groups and infrastructure on Egypt &apos;s territory . 
But Egypt &apos;s divided government has not established a correspondingly coherent policy . 
Relations with Israel are managed by the defense minister , now Lieutenant General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi , and the military security establishment , whose leaders are determined to maintain a peaceful relationship with Israel and to secure Egyptian sovereignty in the Sinai . 
For them , the lawless Bedouin , the Sinai jihadis , and Hamas and other groups in Gaza threaten Egypt &apos;s national security . 
Meanwhile , Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood are playing a double game . 
While Morsi denounced the recent violence ( particularly the deliberate killing of Egyptian policemen ) and issued an implicit threat against Hamas , the Brotherhood published a statement accusing Israel &apos;s Mossad of perpetrating the attack - a claim that Hamas &apos;s Prime Minister of Gaza , Ismael Haniyeh , has repeated . 
In fact , Hamas , too , is playing a double game . 
Having lost Syrian backing , it is hoping that the Egyptian Brothers will provide its kindred movement with political and logistical support . 
Yet it allows radical Palestinians and jihadi groups in Gaza to conduct operations in Sinai . 
The fourth actor , the Sinai jihadis , comprises primarily Bedouins , whose distinct origins and long-time marginalization have led some to identify with radical Islamist groups ( often while working in the Arabian Peninsula ) . 
While this group &apos;s primary goal is to undermine Israel-Egypt relations , they do not shy away from operating directly against the Egyptian state . 
Given their strategic location , Sinai jihadis could easily be used by larger terrorist networks to target strategically vital locations , such as the Suez Canal . 
Egypt &apos;s government was humiliated and incensed by the recent terrorist provocation . 
It is also too early to tell whether Morsi &apos;s shakeup in Cairo was related to , or expedited by , the Sinai events . 
Israel &apos;s longstanding channel of communication with Egypt through the military has disappeared , and may or may not be replaced by a similar channel . 
Hamas and the Bedouins in Sinai have most likely been emboldened by the latest developments in Cairo .
