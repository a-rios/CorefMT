Getting Corruption Right 
NEW YORK - I just returned from India , where I was lecturing to the Indian Parliament in the same hall where US President Barack Obama had recently spoken . 
The country was racked by scandal . 
A gigantic , ministerial-level scam in the mobile-telephone sector had siphoned off many billions of dollars to a corrupt politician . 
But several of the MPs had also been taken aback on discovering that when Obama spoke to them , he read from an &quot; invisible &quot; teleprompter . 
Both episodes were seen as a form of corruption : one involved money , the other deception . 
The two transgressions are obviously not equal in moral turpitude . 
Transparency International and occasionally the World Bank like to rank countries by their degree of corruption , with the media then ceaselessly citing where each country stands . 
What Obama was doing was a common enough practice in the United States ( though one might expect better from an orator of his ability ) ; it was not so in India , where such a technique is , indeed , regarded as reprehensible . 
India certainly has corruption , like almost every other country . 
Even a blind man will tell Transparency International : &quot; I saw him take a bribe with my own eyes . &quot; 
Indeed , a distinguished Indian bureaucrat , a man of unimpeachable character , once told me that his mother had told him : &quot; I believe you are not corrupt only because you are my son ! &quot; 
So , if you ask Indians whether their governance is marked by widespread corruption , they will answer with gusto : yes ! 
But their exuberance biases India &apos;s global ranking relative to more empirically minded countries . 
A similar bias arises from the occasional tendency to view political patronage elsewhere as being more corrupt than the same practices at home . 
For example , when the East Asian financial crisis broke out , there followed a systematic attempt to pin the blame on the affected countries : &quot; crony capitalism &quot; allegedly had somehow crippled their economies ! 
In other words , the acquaintances and benefactors of the East Asian leaders were &quot; cronies , &quot; whereas those of US leaders were &quot; friends &quot; ? 
In fact , it was clear that the culprits were the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury , which had encouraged a shift to capital-account convertibility without understanding that the case for free capital flows was not symmetrical with the case for free trade . 
But where substantial corruption can unambiguously be found , as it often can , one must recognize that it is not a cultural given . 
On the contrary , often it is the result of policies that have fed it . 
India in the 1950 &quot; s had a civil service , and a political class , that were the envy of the world . 
If that seems shocking today , the loss of virtue must be traced to the all-pervasive &quot; permit raj , &quot; with its licensing requirements to import , produce , and invest , which grew to gargantuan proportions . 
High-level bureaucrats quickly discovered that licenses could be bartered for favors , while politicians saw in the system the means to help important financial backers . 
Once the system had taken root , corruption percolated downward , from senior bureaucrats and politicians , who could be bribed do what they were not supposed to do , to lower-level bureaucrats , who would not do what there were supposed to do unless bribed . 
Clerks would not bring out files , or get you your birth certificate or land title , unless you greased their palms . 
But if policies can create corruption , it is equally true that the cost of corruption will vary with the specific policies . 
The cost of corruption has been particularly high in India and Indonesia , where policies created monopolies that earned scarcity rents , which were then allocated to officials &quot; family members . 
Such &quot; rent-creating &quot; corruption is quite expensive and corrosive of growth . 
By contrast , in China , the corruption has largely been of the &quot; profit-sharing &quot; variety , whereby family members are given a stake in the enterprise so that their earnings increase as profits increase - a type of corruption that promotes growth . 
In the long run , of course , both types of corruption are corrosive of the respect and trust that good governance requires , which can undermine economic performance in its own right .
