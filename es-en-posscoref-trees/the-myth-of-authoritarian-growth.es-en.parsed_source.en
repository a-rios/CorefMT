The Myth of Authoritarian Growth 
CAMBRIDGE - On a recent Saturday morning , several hundred pro-democracy activists congregated in a Moscow square to protest government restrictions on freedom of assembly . 
They held up signs reading &quot; 31 , &quot; in reference to Article 31 of the Russian constitution , which guarantees freedom of assembly . 
They were promptly surrounded by policemen , who tried to break up the demonstration . 
A leading critic of the Kremlin and several others were hastily dragged into a police car and driven away . 
Events like this are an almost daily occurrence in Russia , where Prime Minister Vladimir Putin rules the country with a strong hand , and persecution of the government &apos;s opponents , human-rights violations , and judicial abuses have become routine . 
At a time when democracy and human rights have become global norms , such transgressions do little to enhance Russia &apos;s global reputation . 
Authoritarian leaders like Putin understand this , but apparently they see it as price worth paying in order to exercise unbridled power at home . 
What leaders like Putin understand less well is that their politics also compromise their countries &quot; economic future and global economic standing . 
The relationship between a nation &apos;s politics and its economic prospects is one of the most fundamental - and most studied - subjects in all of social science . 
Which is better for economic growth - a strong guiding hand that is free from the pressure of political competition , or a plurality of competing interests that fosters openness to new ideas and new political players ? 
East Asian examples ( South Korea , Taiwan , China ) seem to suggest the former . 
But how , then , can one explain the fact that almost all wealthy countries - except those that owe their riches to natural resources alone - are democratic ? 
Should political openness precede , rather than follow , economic growth ? 
For every authoritarian country that has managed to grow rapidly , there are several that have floundered . 
For every Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore , there are many like Mobutu Sese Seko of the Congo . 
Democracies not only out-perform dictatorships when it comes to long-term economic growth , but also outdo them in several other important respects . 
They provide much greater economic stability , measured by the ups and downs of the business cycle . 
They are better at adjusting to external economic shocks ( such as terms-of-trade declines or sudden stops in capital inflows ) . 
They generate more investment in human capital - health and education . 
Authoritarian regimes , by contrast , ultimately produce economies that are as fragile as their political systems . 
Their economic potency , when it exists , rests on the strength of individual leaders , or on favorable but temporary circumstances . 
They cannot aspire to continued economic innovation or to global economic leadership . 
At first sight , China seems to be an exception . 
Since the late 1970 &quot; s , following the end of Mao &apos;s disastrous experiments , China has done extremely well , experiencing unparalleled rates of economic growth . 
Even though it has democratized some of its local decision-making , the Chinese Communist Party maintains a tight grip on national politics and the human-rights picture is marred by frequent abuses . 
But China also remains a comparatively poor country . 
Its future economic progress depends in no small part on whether it manages to open its political system to competition , in much the same way that it has opened up its economy . 
Without this transformation , the lack of institutionalized mechanisms for voicing and organizing dissent will eventually produce conflicts that will overwhelm the capacity of the regime to suppress . 
Political stability and economic growth will both suffer . 
Still , Russia and China are both large and powerful economies . 
Their example can sway leaders elsewhere to think that they can aspire to economic ascendancy while tightening the screws on domestic political opposition . 
Consider Turkey , a rising economic power in the Middle East that seemed destined until recently to become the region &apos;s sole Muslim democracy . 
During his first term in office , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan relaxed some restrictions on Kurdish minorities and passed reforms that aligned the country &apos;s legal regime with European norms . 
But more recently Erdogan and his allies have launched a thinly disguised campaign to intimidate their opponents and cement government control over the media and public institutions . 
They have incarcerated hundreds of military officers , academics , and journalists on fabricated charges of fomenting terror and plotting coups . 
So widespread is wiretapping and harassment of Erdogan &apos;s critics that some believe the country has turned into a &quot; republic of fear . &quot; 
This turn towards authoritarianism bodes ill for the Turkish economy , despite its strong fundamentals . 
It will have corrosive effects on the quality of policymaking , as well as undermine Turkey &apos;s claim to global economic standing . 
For the true up-and-coming economic superpowers , we should turn instead to countries like Brazil , India , and South Africa , which have already accomplished their democratic transitions and are unlikely to regress . 
None of these countries is without problems , of course . 
Brazil has yet to recover fully its economic dynamism and find a path to rapid growth . 
India &apos;s democracy can be maddening in its resistance to economic change . 
Yet these challenges are nothing compared to the momentous tasks of institutional transformation that await authoritarian countries . 
Don &apos;t be surprised if Brazil leaves Turkey in the dust , South Africa eventually surpasses Russia , and India outdoes China .
