The Battle of the Bonds 
LONDON - Everyone knows that Greece will default on its external debt . 
The only question concerns the best way to arrange it so that no one really understands that Greece is actually defaulting . 
On this topic , there is no shortage of expert plans - among them bond buy-backs , bond swaps , and the creation of Eurobonds , a European version of the &quot; Brady &quot; bonds issued by Latin American countries that defaulted in the 1980 &quot; s . 
What all such schemes amount to is piling one lot of bonds on top of another in an attempt to square the circle of Greece &apos;s inability to pay , and to minimize the losses faced by its creditors - mostly European banks . 
Every week , a preposterous coterie of European bankers and finance ministers drags itself from one capital to another to discuss which default / restructuring plan to adopt . 
Meanwhile , Greece &apos;s agony continues , and the &quot; markets &quot; wait to swoop down on Portugal , Ireland , Italy , and Spain . 
No one who is not well versed in financial legerdemain can make much sense of this battle of the bonds . 
The first is traditional disapproval of debt . 
The oldest rule in personal finance is to avoid debt - that is , never spend more than you earn . 
Economists and moralists have been united in believing that you should actually spend less than you earn - in order to &quot; save &quot; for the proverbial rainy day or for old age . 
Getting into debt was long associated with profligacy or fecklessness . 
Indeed , it was often more than a point of honor : failure to repay debt on time landed the debtor in prison . 
The same attitude governed institutional debt . 
Banks grew out of a practice by gold smiths and silver smiths , who , for a small price , accepted deposits for safekeeping . 
When they became lending institutions , their earliest rule was to keep almost 100 % of cash reserves against their loans , so that they would not be caught short if most of their depositors decided to withdraw their money at the same time . 
Similarly , before the introduction of limited liability in the nineteenth century , a company &apos;s shareholders or partners were each liable for all of the firm &apos;s debts , which severely restricted businesses &quot; willingness to borrow to finance trade . 
For public finance , too , the orthodox rule was that budgets should always be balanced ; except in emergencies , governments should never spend more than they &quot; earned &quot; in taxation . 
Again , it was a point of honor for governments to pay back such debts as they were incurred , whatever the sacrifice to the country . 
Until recently , the conventional view was that &quot; mature &quot; sovereigns always honored their debts , while only banana republics failed to do so . 
These historically embedded norms and practices were only slowly superseded . 
With fear of bank runs and defaults receding , banks &quot; reserve ratios became ever smaller , thus increasing their lending facilities . 
On this bedrock rose an imposing edifice of bond markets and banks that drove down the cost of finance , and thus sped up the rate of economic growth . 
It was this system of financial intermediation whose near-collapse in 2008 seemed for many to justify the ancient warnings of the perils of indebtedness . 
In their exhaustive historical review of financial crises , Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff write : &quot; Again and again , countries , banks , individuals , and firms take on excessive debt in good times without enough awareness of the risks that will follow when the inevitable recession hits . &quot; 
But there is a contrary moral attitude , the essence of which is that , whereas excessive debt is to be deplored , the blame for it lies with the lender , not the borrower . 
&quot; Neither a borrower nor a lender be , &quot; Polonius admonished in Hamlet . 
Lending money at interest was identified with &quot; usury , &quot; or making money from money rather than from goods and services - a distinction that goes back to Aristotle , for whom money was barren . 
The moneylender was the most hated figure in medieval Europe . 
The last legal restrictions on taking interest on money were lifted only in the nineteenth century , when they succumbed to the economic argument that lending money was a service , for which the lender was entitled to charge whatever the market would bear . 
These two moral attitudes confront each other today in the battle of the bonds . 
The demand for debt repayment confronts the philosophy of debt forgiveness . 
In the lender &apos;s view , the 17 % interest rate that Greece &apos;s government now has to pay for its 10-year bonds accurately reflects the lender &apos;s risk in buying Greek government debt . 
It is the price of past profligacy . 
The sensible middle position would surely be an agreed write-off of a portion of the outstanding Greek debt , combined with a five-year moratorium on interest payments on the remainder . 
This would immediately relieve pressure on Greece &apos;s budget and give its government the time and incentive to put the country &apos;s economy in order . 
In the long run , however , we will have to answer the broader question that the eurozone &apos;s various debt crises have raised : Is the social value of making finance cheap worth the days of reckoning for stricken debtors ?
