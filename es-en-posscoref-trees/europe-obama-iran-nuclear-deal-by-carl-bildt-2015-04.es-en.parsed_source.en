Why Europe Backs Obama on Iran 
PARMA - Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu seems close to ordering a general mobilization of his country &apos;s military , and Republicans in the United States are preparing for a ferocious battle with President Barack Obama &apos;s administration , in the wake of the framework nuclear agreement with Iran . 
And yet the framework deal has been almost universally welcomed in Europe . 
What accounts for this disconnect within the West over a key regional and global threat ? 
Several factors are at work . 
One , certainly , is that Europe - or , more precisely , the United Kingdom , Germany , and France - has been engaged in the talks with Iran for more than a decade . 
Even as former President George W. Bush branded Iran a part of an &quot; axis of evil , &quot; the key European Union members insisted that diplomacy was better than war . 
And , step by step , the European approach has been vindicated . 
Critical to that outcome , of course , was the US intelligence community &apos;s reports that all the evidence pointed to Iran having long ago - in 2003 - abandoned concrete plans to develop a nuclear weapon . 
It is easy to see why the Iranians would have done so . 
So long as Saddam Hussein , who had launched a brutal eight-year war against Iran in the 1980s , and whom influential Westerners openly accused of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons , remained in power , the Iranian government &apos;s plan to develop nuclear weapons followed a certain realist logic . 
Once the US military ousted Saddam &apos;s regime in 2003 , Iran &apos;s most acute security threat vanished . 
Moreover , there has long been a tactical difference between US and European policies toward Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
At times , the US seemingly sought to eradicate any knowledge of nuclear technology from a country of which it is deeply suspicious , whereas the European approach was to seek reliable assurances that Iran would never develop a nuclear weapon . 
At the end of the day , the US recognized that any realistic policy needed European support , while Europeans saw preventing a rush to war by the US or Israel as a central policy objective . 
It should also be said that Europeans have never been overly impressed with America &apos;s hardline approach toward that other charter member of the axis of evil , North Korea , and its nuclear ambitions . 
Refusing to negotiate with the North Korean regime , and imposing the most stringent sanctions on it , has not stopped it from either acquiring nuclear weapons or accelerating its development of both nuclear and missile technologies . 
Among the significant issues that need to be sorted out before the end-of-June deadline for reaching a final deal with Iran is to agree on the details of the gradual suspension , and eventual repeal , of economic and diplomatic sanctions against the country . 
While this will be the subject of a fierce political battle in the US , it is likely that the European Union will be far more willing to move ahead . 
Indeed , Europe has sound reasons to lift the restrictions on Iranian oil exports . 
Additional supplies of oil to global markets will keep prices down or depress them further . 
Apart from the economic gain for Europe &apos;s economies , low oil prices yield important strategic benefits - particularly with respect to constraining Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s revisionist ambitions in Ukraine and elsewhere . 
Needless to say , the US and Europe should stick to a common approach on the sanctions issue . 
But were a more militant policy approach by the Republican-controlled US Congress to prevail , America might well find that it loses the ally that makes the key difference for the sanctions &quot; success . 
Indeed , on this issue , the US might rapidly find itself isolated from all other global actors . 
Europe is certainly not naive about the nature of the Iranian regime . 
France , with its historically strong convictions on issues concerning nuclear proliferation , has taken a particularly firm stance during the talks . 
But Europe is also acutely aware of the consequences of the rapid increase in violent conflict and suffering in its immediate neighborhood ; indeed , Europeans see those consequences daily in the flood of refugees trying to reach its shores . 
Another war in the Middle East is clearly not in its interest . 
Finally , Israel is a key factor underlying the differences between the US and Europe when it comes to Iran . 
Though Netanyahu &apos;s shrill words still have an attentive audience in the US , most of Europe regards his position as being only a little short of ridiculous . 
Thus , it is nearly certain that , assuming a final agreement with Iran is reached in June , Europe &apos;s backing for it will be unanimous - or close to it - and that it will be eager to support Obama in his battle with opponents of the deal at home . 
The framework agreement has vindicated Europe &apos;s approach to resolving the nuclear dispute .
