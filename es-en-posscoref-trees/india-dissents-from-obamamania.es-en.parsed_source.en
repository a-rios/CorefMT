India Dissents from Obamamania 
NEW DELHI - India is among the few dozen countries , largely clustered in Asia and Africa , where sentiment in favor of the United States actually rose during the administration of George W. Bush . 
Nonetheless , more Indians favored the election of Barack Obama than they did John McCain . 
What explains this seeming contradiction ? 
At the heart of the Bush administration &apos;s success with India was a belief that India was a nation whose rise was beneficial to US interests . 
The net result was a closer Indo-US relationship and a positive view of Bush that overrode unpopular actions such as invading Iraq . 
Obama &apos;s election - the success of a member of a non-white minority in the world &apos;s oldest democratic polity - has seized the imagination of many Indians . 
He is exhorted in the media and among the intellectual classes . 
Among the most fervent supporters of Obama in the US have been the nearly three million-strong Indian-American community . 
&quot; You can &apos;t swing a dead cat in the Obama camp without hitting an Indian-American , &quot; said an Obama advisor . 
In the run up to the election , many Indians could not believe that an African-American would ever be chosen to reside in the White House . 
His election inevitably enhanced the standing of the US as a land of genuine opportunity , a nation whose multicultural credentials were as great if not better than polyglot and poly-ethnic India . 
The greatest skepticism about an Obama presidency lies among Indian strategic elite , who are focused on promoting India &apos;s economic and political interests in the wider world . 
Whatever Obama &apos;s ethnic credentials , India &apos;s government has detected in his statements reason to believe that he will be less supportive than Bush . 
First , India is wary that any Democratic administration will include the same proponents of nuclear nonproliferation who opposed Bush &apos;s exemption for India . 
Obama has publicly said he intends to push for a comprehensive test ban treaty , a treaty that India opposes because it feels its own nuclear deterrent remains incomplete . 
Second , Obama has attacked the outsourcing of service jobs to places like India and the offshoring of manufacturing jobs to Asia as a whole . 
His advisors also indicate that they will seek to incorporate social provisions , like labor standards , into future international trade negotiations . 
Though candidates tend to rollback from protectionist stances once they come to power , the Democrats &quot; control of both houses of Congress may not give Obama that leeway . 
Third , a Democratic administration has said it will put climate change at the forefront of its global policy concerns . 
If the focus is about mitigating carbon production through technological means , there will be few concerns . 
However , if the policy slips into more coercive measures such as carbon tariffs and the like , the result is likely to convert climate change into an energy security struggle . 
It will also pit the big carbon emitters of the future , like India and China , against present polluters like the US and Europe . 
Finally , conversations with a few Obama advisors and his own speeches indicate that Washington &apos;s number one security concern in the coming years will be Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
&quot; Iraq is yesterday &apos;s problem , &quot; said one advisor to an Indian audience several weeks ago . 
At the heart of that problem , say Obama advisors , is the growing neurosis of the Pakistani regime . 
Pakistan suffers from internal strife and is prone to seeing conspiracies against it that include virtually all of its neighbors and often the US . 
One element in such a policy of reassurance , repeatedly said by Obama and most recently in a television interview , is to &quot; try to resolve the Kashmir crisis so that they &#91; Pakistan &#93; can stay focused not on India , but on the situation with those militants . &quot; 
This is a sensible goal , and one India &apos;s leaders will acknowledge as in their country &apos;s interest . 
Kashmir is a diplomatic minefield . 
One misstep by the new Obama administration could result in a deep freeze of the Indo-US relationship for years . 
Ultimately , the indicators are that the new Obama administration will seek to restore an international status quo that preceded the Bush presidency . 
If so , the question for India will be whether this is accomplished by reducing the international space that the country gained under Bush . 
If so , there is a strong likelihood that one area in which an Obama administration will fail to gain traction is in advancing the Indo-US relationship in areas outside the strictly economic .
