The Perils of Economic Consensus 
PRINCETON - The Initiative on Global Markets , based at the University of Chicago , periodically surveys a group of leading academic economists , of varying political persuasions , on the issues of the day . 
Its latest roundup asked whether President Barack Obama &apos;s stimulus plan helped to reduce unemployment in the United States . 
Officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , the plan entailed government spending of more than $ 800 billion on infrastructure , education , health , and energy , tax incentives , and various social programs . 
Implemented in the midst of an economic crisis , it was the classic Keynesian response . 
The economists were virtually unanimous . 
Thirty-six of the 37 top economists who responded to the survey said that the plan had been successful in its avowed objective of reducing unemployment . 
The University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers cheered the consensus in his New York Times blog . 
In fact , economists agree on many things , a number of which are politically controversial . 
The Harvard economist Greg Mankiw listed some of them in 2009 . 
The following propositions garnered support from at least 90 % of economists : import tariffs and quotas reduce general economic welfare ; rent controls reduce the supply of housing ; floating exchange rates provide an effective international monetary system ; the US should not restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries ; and fiscal policy stimulates the economy when there is less than full employment . 
This consensus about so many important issues contrasts rather starkly with the general perception that economists rarely agree on anything . 
&quot; If all the economists were laid end to end , &quot; George Bernard Shaw famously quipped , &quot; they would not reach a conclusion . &quot; 
Frustrated by the conflicting and hedged advice that he was receiving from his advisers , President Dwight Eisenhower is said to have asked once for a &quot; one-handed economist . &quot; 
No doubt , there are many public-policy questions that economists debate vigorously . 
What should the top income-tax rate be ? 
Should the minimum wage be raised ? 
Should the fiscal deficit be reduced by raising taxes or cutting spending ? 
Do patents stimulate or impede innovation ? 
On these and many other issues , economists tend to be good at seeing both sides of the issue , and I suspect that a survey on such questions would reveal little consensus . 
A consensus among economists can arise for both good and bad reasons . 
Sometimes a consensus is innocuous enough , as when you hear economists argue that one ignores the role of incentives at one &apos;s peril . 
Can anyone really disagree with that ? 
Sometimes it is restricted to a particular episode and is based on evidence accumulated after the fact : Yes , the Soviet economic system was hugely inefficient ; yes , the Obama fiscal stimulus of 2009 did reduce unemployment . 
But when a consensus forms around the universal applicability of a specific model , the critical assumptions of which are likely to be violated in many settings , we have a problem . 
Consider some of the areas of widespread agreement that I listed above . 
The proposition that trade restrictions reduce economic welfare is certainly not generally valid , and it is violated when certain conditions - such as externalities or increasing returns to scale - are present . 
Moreover , it requires that economists make value judgments on distributional effects , which are better left to the electorate itself . 
Likewise , the proposition that rent controls reduce the supply of housing is violated under conditions of imperfect competition . 
And the proposition that floating exchange rates are an effective system relies on assumptions about the workings of the monetary and financial system that have proved problematic ; 
Perhaps economists tend to agree that certain assumptions are more prevalent in the real world . 
Or they think that one set of models works better &quot; on average &quot; than another . 
Even so , as scientists , should they not adorn their endorsements with the appropriate caveats ? 
Shouldn &apos;t they worry that categorical statements such as those above may prove to be misleading in at least some settings ? 
The problem is that economists often confuse a model for the model . 
When that happens , a consensus is certainly not something to cheer about . 
Two kinds of mischief may then follow . 
First , there are errors of omission - cases in which blind spots in the consensus prevent economists from being able to see troubles looming ahead . 
A recent example is the failure of economists to grasp the dangerous confluence of circumstances that produced the global financial crisis . 
The oversight was not due to the lack of models of bubbles , asymmetric information , distorted incentives , or bank runs . 
Then there are the errors of commission - cases in which economists &quot; fixation on one particular model of the world makes them complicit in the administration of policies whose failure could have been predicted ahead of time . 
Economists &quot; advocacy of neoliberal &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; policies and of financial globalization falls into this category . 
What happened in both cases is that economists overlooked serious second-best complications , such as learning externalities and weak institutions , which blunted the reforms and , in some cases , caused them to backfire . 
Disagreements among economists are healthy . 
They reflect the fact that their discipline comprises a diverse collection of models , and that matching reality to model is an imperfect science with a lot of room for error . 
It is better for the public to be exposed to this uncertainty than for it to be lulled into a false sense of security based on the appearance of certain knowledge .
