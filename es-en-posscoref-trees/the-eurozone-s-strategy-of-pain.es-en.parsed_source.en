The Eurozone &apos;s Strategy of Pain 
BRUSSELS - For the third year in a row , the eurozone is the weakest link in the world economy . 
In 2010 , attention was focused on responses to the crisis on the eurozone periphery - Greece , Portugal , and Ireland . 
In 2011 , the crisis moved to the core , with Italy and Spain feeling the heat , and concerns mounting about the viability of the eurozone itself . 
The question for 2012 is whether those tensions will abate or reach a new climax . 
Once again , the Greek crisis is the focus of attention and epitomizes Europe &apos;s failings . 
Once again , hard decisions have to be made about debt restructuring and the provision of further assistance to Athens . 
But the depth of Greece &apos;s woes should not obscure the fact that it is a small economy and , in many respects , an extreme , special case . 
No other country flouted the European Union &apos;s budget rules the way Greece did , or has accumulated as large a public-debt burden , and no other EU country combines to the same extent a dysfunctional state and an uncompetitive private economy . 
The real battle is being fought in Italy and Spain . 
Both countries &quot; borrowing conditions deteriorated in the second half of 2011 . 
Both are so large - accounting for 17 % and 11 % of eurozone GDP , respectively - that financing them through multilateral assistance would strain , if not exhaust , the resources of the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund . 
Both recently installed new , reform-minded governments . 
If they succeed , the euro will survive ; if they fail , it won &apos;t , at least in its present form . 
That is why discussions over the last few months have largely , if implicitly , been about how to support adjustment and reform in Italy and Spain . 
Proposals to permit the European Central Bank to intervene more decisively in bond markets , or to increase the size of the &quot; firewall &quot; by leveraging the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) , were intended to set an upper limit on interest rates paid by Italy and Spain on their debt emissions . 
Similarly , proposals to create common bonds were intended to quell expectations of insolvency by ensuring that these countries would eventually be able to borrow against their eurozone partners &quot; guarantee . 
All of the discussions were couched in general terms , but everybody had the same specific countries in mind . 
None of these proposals , it seems , will be implemented anytime soon . 
The ECB has bought some Italian and Spanish bonds , and it might buy more , but it has made clear that it is not ready to commit to a ceiling for long-term interest rates . 
The EFSF &apos;s size will be increased by accelerating the creation of the permanent European Stability Mechanism , and by letting it overlap with the EFSF . 
Likewise , Eurobonds are officially off the agenda , at least for now . 
Rather , Europe is putting in place a new fiscal compact to ensure that all eurozone countries adopt and implement stringent budgetary rules . 
These choices partly reflect pragmatic concerns : all of the financial-engineering schemes that have been proposed to protect Italy and Spain from aggravated borrowing conditions raise legal , political , or governance difficulties . 
But there is a principle at issue as well : it is thought ( particularly in Germany ) that protection from market pressure would only impede adjustment and reform . 
Indeed , the perception in Northern Europe is that only serious strains provide the required incentives to overcome domestic political and social obstacles to slashing public spending and reforming labor markets . 
For Southern Europe , no pain means no gain : a deep recession and a sharp increase in unemployment may be the price of lasting improvements in productivity and competitiveness . 
This reasoning is not without justification . 
Soon after the ECB began buying Italian bonds last August , then-Prime minister Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s government backtracked on its commitments to tax reform . 
Even though it later reversed its stance , the episode was widely regarded as clear evidence of the moral-hazard effect of ECB support . 
Only after the bond market turned on Berlusconi again was he replaced by the reform-minded Mario Monti . 
But the strategy is a high-risk gamble . 
Governments may need incentives to act , but they also need to be able to show their citizens that reform pays . 
If , after a few quarters of fiscal adjustment and painful reform , output is lower , unemployment higher , and the outlook darker , governments may soon lose public support and reform may stall , as we have seen in Greece . 
Reform-minded teams may lose power to populists . 
Furthermore , a degraded macroeconomic and financial environment increases the likelihood of bank failures , with immediate consequences for public finances and economic confidence . 
These risks are compounded by the need for reform in several countries at once . 
Indeed , there is a &quot; fallacy of composition &quot; in the current approach : the countries in need of serious adjustment and improved competitiveness include the whole of Southern Europe and France , and jointly account for more than one-half of eurozone GDP . 
True , competition for investment is an incentive to act . 
It is one thing to believe that governments act only under pressure , and that societies accept reforms only if they believe that there is no other alternative ; it is quite another to believe that adjustment and reform will proceed if all of Southern Europe is struggling with recession . 
Keeping Southern Europe on a short leash would be a more credible strategy if accompanied by a growth program for the entire eurozone .
