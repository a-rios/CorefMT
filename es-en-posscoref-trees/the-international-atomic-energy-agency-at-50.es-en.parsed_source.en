The International Atomic Energy Agency at 50 
This summer &apos;s 50th anniversary of the International Atomic Energy Agency &apos;s ( IAEA ) founding offers an opportunity for stocktaking about the world &apos;s most important nuclear watchdog . 
It comes at a time when the Agency has assumed increasing responsibility for nuclear security . 
The recent dispatch of inspectors to verify the shutdown of North Korea &apos;s weapons reactor and the continuing efforts to ferret out Iran &apos;s nuclear intentions are only the most visible signs of its monitoring function . 
But , while there is much to celebrate , questions remain about whether the IAEA can increase its capacity both to combat proliferation and promote nuclear power plant safety . 
History suggests that without greater authority , the Agency will be incapable of dramatically reducing global nuclear risks . 
The IAEA traces its lineage to the early dark days of the Cold War . 
In his December 1953 UN General Assembly &quot; Atoms for Peace &quot; address , US President Dwight Eisenhower sought to relax atomic weapons competition with the Soviet Union by calling for the creation of an international nuclear fuel bank stocked with superpower fissile material . 
Although the fuel bank never emerged , the seed for the organization took root , giving rise to the IAEA in 1957 . 
In time , the IAEA became a nuclear brain bank , assisting developing countries with their peaceful nuclear needs . 
It educated nuclear operators , generated safety and protection standards , promoted the benefits of the atom for industry , agriculture , and medicine , and much more . 
In 1970 , boosted by the new Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , the IAEA acquired expanded authority to safeguard nuclear elements against diversion . 
Today , this responsibility extends to more than 180 countries . 
In practice , however , the IAEA has an uneven record in tracking down nuclear cheats . 
In 1981 , following Israel &apos;s bombing of Iraq &apos;s Osirak reactor , IAEA inspector Roger Richter told the US Congress how Saddam had blocked IAEA access to nuclear sites . 
After the 1991 Persian Gulf War , Iraq once again embarrassed the IAEA , when inspectors uncovered a major covert nuclear weapons program . 
In 2003 , Libya &apos;s renunciation of its secret weapons revealed how another country had hoodwinked the Agency . 
And , only recently , the IAEA discovered that Egypt conducted non-safeguarded nuclear experiments decades ago . 
Despite these errors , in the past few years , the IAEA has demonstrated its worth as an effective nuclear sleuth . 
In 2002 , its inspectors revealed North Korea &apos;s cheating , prompting UN sanctions . 
( Unfortunately , this did not halt the country &apos;s subsequent withdrawal from the NPT . ) 
The IAEA &apos;s tenacity also has smoked out much of Iran &apos;s nuclear program , albeit only after an Iranian dissident group disclosed the existence of some of the regime &apos;s secret facilities . 
In early 2003 , its onsite presence in Iraq established that Saddam did not have a nuclear weapons program , contrary to the Bush administration &apos;s representations . 
And in 2004 , the IAEA blew the whistle on South Korea &apos;s non-safeguarded plutonium and enrichment experiments . 
Beyond truth seeking , the IAEA has taken a leadership role in promoting new initiatives to reduce weapons proliferation . 
It has pressed for multinational nuclear fuel facilities that would eliminate the need for national installations that draw proliferation concerns . 
Director General Mohamed El Baradei has called upon the US to negotiate directly with Iran over its atomic program . 
He also has attempted to generate momentum for a Middle East nuclear weapons-free zone . 
Looking forward , the IAEA confronts both internal and external challenges . 
Internally , mandatory retirements will soon cost the Agency 50 % of its senior management . 
More significant is the IAEA &apos;s failure to overcome resistance to conclude comprehensive safeguard agreements . 
Some countries oppose the application of NPT safeguards to small quantities of nuclear materials . 
The unwillingness of more than half the NPT membership to apply the Additional Protocol , which gives the IAEA new flexibility to uncover clandestine nuclear activity , undermines global security . 
The projected rapid growth of nuclear energy will generate yet more challenges . 
To date , reactor construction has been concentrated in the industrial world . 
In coming years , developing countries with little nuclear experience - Indonesia , Vietnam , Thailand , Jordan , Turkey , Egypt , and others - will attempt to leap onto the atomic bandwagon . 
Without authority to enforce safe practices , the IAEA cannot better assure nuclear safety in these or other countries . 
And without better intelligence and backing from the UN Security Council to impose significant , timely , and certain penalties on nuclear violators , the IAEA will have difficulty in fulfilling its security mandate . 
So , although the IAEA will continue to play a vital role , it will be more of a band-aid than a cure for the atomic risks that we will all have to assume .
