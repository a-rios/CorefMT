The March of the Caudillos 
LA PAZ  -  
At least Russian president Vladimir Putin had the decency to honor the form of his country &apos;s constitution when he recently promised to step down and run for parliament . Of course , several recent Latin American presidents succeeded in changing their countries &quot; constitutions to lengthen their terms in office . 
Argentina &apos;s Carlos Menem , the heir to Peronism , the continent &apos;s most enduring form of caudillismo , was one such example , but his was a soft caudillismo , which basically maintained democratic norms . 
C audillismo has two key facets . 
Second , although caudillismo personalizes politics , it depends less on the characteristics of the caudillo than on the social , political , and economic conditions of the country in which caudillismo takes root . 
In other words , although a caudillo &quot; s charisma matters , he or she is a social creation . 
These two ideas are helpful in understanding Chávez and Morales . 
Like the old caudillos , they concentrate representation of their supporters in themselves . 
Whereas representation in democratic countries is based on people &apos;s confidence that they can achieve a better future under their elected leaders , in countries like Venezuela and Bolivia nowadays , representation is based on a simple identification with the leader : &quot; He &apos;s one of us . &quot; 
The way &quot; us &quot; is defined links the caudillo with his supporters by building an uncomplicated and easily invoked collective identity that facilitates communication and political mobilization , while also implying submission by all citizens . 
Morales and Chávez always emphasize their humble origins in order to appeal emotionally to those who share those characteristics with them , and to blackmail those who do not . 
This image is strengthened each time the caudillo engages in confrontation with some large , and usually vaguely defined , enemy : the Empire or the United States , the oligarchies , the traditional parties , or the transnational corporations . 
But caudillos have other uses for conflict : it allows them to strengthen the unity of their popular bases and evade the management responsibilities that exercising political power entails . 
They construct politics in such a way that there will always be an enemy to blame for any problems that arise . 
Chávez and Morales have been accumulating power by dismantling their societies &quot; fragile institutional checks and balances , while permanently weakening their adversaries . 
Traditional parties and the administrations that preceded the caudillo are dismissed as corrupt and elitist . 
It follows from this that constitutions must be changed to reduce the role of Congress , subordinate the judiciary , and centralize economic resources . 
In such schemes , Chávez has so far had more success than Morales , whose Constitutional Assembly has not yet been able to organize itself . 
President Rafael Correa of Ecuador looks like he also wants to move in the same direction . 
The rise of these modern caudillos reflects a crisis in political parties and an acute intensification of social unease across the continent . 
Latin America &apos;s economic and social structures remain marked by great inequality , weak institutions , and an abundance of natural resources . 
Chávez and Morales , each in his own way , have taken advantage of this situation , worsening conditions to enfeeble their opponents and living off the wealth generated by natural resources , not new economic activity . 
With a popular base that demands change - and that knows that change requires gaining access to state-owned wealth - social attitudes have developed that are receptive to the promises made by the caudillos . 
The weaker a country &apos;s institutions , the more evident the inequalities , and the more concentrated the economic resources , the greater the caudillo &apos;s powers will be . 
Concentration of resources is probably the key factor , because it increases both the discretionary power of whoever controls them and the population &apos;s social expectations , which in the end cannot ever be met , because the caudillo &apos;s power depends on maintaining that concentration of resources . 
Caudillismo will be weakened only if profits are not captured by the state , but directly shared with citizens in a stable and continuous manner . 
A decline in extreme poverty and inequality , and the creation of trustworthy institutions , can be achieved in the country &apos;s beguiled by caudillismo only if the caudillo loses control of the wealth that sustains his rule .
