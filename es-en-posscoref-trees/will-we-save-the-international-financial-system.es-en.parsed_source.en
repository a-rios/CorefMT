Will We Save the International Financial System ? 
The World Bank and IMF have completed their annual meetings , which were greeted by street demonstrations and a paucity of innovative ideas . 
Here George Soros suggests a bold new tack to restructure the world &apos;s financial system . 
The international financial system is broken down in the sense that it fails to provide adequate capital to countries that need it most and qualify for it . 
Global financial markets suck most of the world &apos;s savings to the center , but they fail to pump money back out to the periphery . 
Indeed , since 1997 , there has been a reverse flow of capital from countries on the poor periphery of the world economy to those in the wealthy center . 
The facts speak for themselves . 
America runs a chronic current account deficit approaching an astonishing 5 % of GDP ; $ 242 billion in the first half of this year . 
At the same time , Brazil - which has followed sound economic policies and has healthy budget and trade surpluses - cannot refinance its debt at acceptable rates . 
The prevailing belief that market discipline corrects such imbalances is false , for two reasons . 
Instability arises because financial markets try to discount a future that depends on their own behavior . 
It is now recognized that this can lead to what economists call &quot; multiple equilibria , &quot; but we continue to deny the clear implication that financial markets cannot be left to their own devices . 
In practice , of course , international financial markets never have been left to their own devices . 
Rich countries , led by the US , are in charge . 
Their primary task is protecting their own interests . 
When these countries get into trouble , their authorities intervene forcefully . 
Countries that cannot borrow in international markets in their own currency lack that power . 
They must turn to the IMF , and the IMF is more concerned with international financial stability than with enabling developing countries to pursue the countercyclical policies needed to avoid recession . 
Until recently , IMF rescue programs were designed to enable debtor countries to meet their obligations . 
Taxpayers in debtor countries , such as Mexico , picked up the tab . 
This may have been unfair , but at least it kept money flowing to the periphery . 
The emerging market crisis of 1997-1998 changed all this . 
That crisis was attributed not to instability in the financial markets and the lopsidedness of the system , but to the &quot; moral hazard &quot; introduced by IMF bail-outs . 
This lead to a U-turn : from bail-outs to &quot; bail-ins , &quot; and to private sector burden sharing . 
Moral hazard has been curtailed but the risks of investing in emerging markets increased . 
Those risks are now reflected in market prices , which is the source of today &apos;s problem . 
What can prevent the situation from deteriorating further and perhaps culminating in a systemic crisis ? 
In the broadest terms , we must create a more level playing field . 
There is nothing wrong with imposing market discipline on countries that follow unsound policies , but the risk-reward ratio for lending and investing has shifted too far against the periphery . 
Countries that qualify ought to have access to a lender of last resort and be empowered to pursue countercyclical policies . 
Brazil , for example , confronts an unambiguous case of market failure . 
Although the maximum sustainable real interest rate is about 10 % , Brazil &apos;s dollar-denominated debt yields 24.5 % . 
A one-year Real note pays 27 % . 
At these rates , Brazil is heading for bankruptcy . 
If no lender of last resort ensures that credit is available at or below 10 % , Brazil cannot be expected to meet its obligations - dealing a terrible blow both to Brazil and the international financial system . 
Where there is a political will , there is a way . 
For instance , the central banks of the US , Europe , Japan , and Britain could accept Brazilian paper at their discount windows . 
The IMF could guarantee the central banks against market risk at current prices . 
This would provide a tremendous boost to the market and drastically reduce interest rates . 
Naturally , all guarantees would be conditional on Brazil abiding by the IMF agreement . 
If successful , the IMF guarantee would never be invoked . 
What I propose is novel : it would leverage the IMF &apos;s $ 30 billion loan to Brazil tenfold ( and set a useful precedent ) . 
Unfortunately , such a scheme exceeds the imagination and political will of the IMF &apos;s shareholders . 
But let &apos;s be clear : failure to address the problem could have disastrous consequences . 
After all , how would a Brazilian default affect Mexico ? 
Addressing the broader , system-wide problem , we must find ways to stimulate domestic-led growth in the periphery countries . 
Countries that follow sound macroeconomic policies do not derive sufficient economic benefits from doing so . 
This generates political discontent that could have adverse consequences beyond the economic sphere . 
At present , the US serves as the motor of the global economy . 
But a chronic current account deficit is unsound , unfair , and unsustainable in the long run . 
More urgently , the US motor is sputtering . 
It would be benefit all parties to start another motor . 
To this end , I proposed an annual issue of Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) that rich countries would donate for international assistance . 
This is a proposal whose time has come because the world economy is hovering on the brink of deflation . 
Until recently , globalization unfolded against the background of a global boom ; now we are experiencing a global bear market . 
I am afraid globalization may not survive unless we find new ways to stimulate the global economy . 
The SDR donation scheme would activate resources that are currently idle , benefiting donors and recipients . 
It would also reduce the increasing inequality between rich and poor countries .
