Homosexuality is Not Immoral 
In recent years , the Netherlands , Belgium , Canada , and Spain have recognized marriages between people of the same sex . 
Several other countries recognize civil unions with similar legal effect . 
An even wider range of countries have laws against discrimination on the basis of a person &apos;s sexual orientation , in areas like housing and employment . 
Yet in the world &apos;s largest democracy , India , sex between two men remains a crime punishable , according to statute , by imprisonment for life . 
India is not , of course , the only nation to retain severe punishments for homosexuality . 
In some Islamic nations - Afghanistan , Iran , Iraq , Saudi Arabia , and Yemen , for instance - sodomy is a crime for which the maximum penalty is death . 
Anyone who has visited India and seen the sexually explicit temple carvings that are common there will know that the Hindu tradition has a less prudish attitude to sex than Christianity . 
India &apos;s prohibition of homosexuality dates back to 1861 , when the British ruled the subcontinent and imposed Victorian morality upon it . 
It is ironic , therefore , that Britain has long ago repealed its own similar prohibition , while India retains its law as a colonial relic . 
Fortunately , the prohibition of sodomy in India is not enforced . 
Yet it provides a basis for blackmail and harassment of homosexuals , and has made it more difficult for groups that educate people about HIV and AIDS to carry out their work . 
Vikram Seth , the author of A Suitable Boy and other fine novels , recently published an open letter to the government of India calling for a repeal of the law that makes homosexuality a crime . 
Many other notable Indians signed the letter , while still others , including the Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen , have given it their support . 
A legal challenge to the law is currently before the high court in Delhi . 
Around the time when India &apos;s prohibition of sodomy was enacted , John Stuart Mill was writing his celebrated essay On Liberty , in which he put forward the following principle : 
... the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community , against his will , is to prevent harm to others . 
His own good , either physical or moral , is not sufficient warrant .... Over himself , over his own body and mind , the individual is sovereign . 
Mill &apos;s principle is not universally accepted . 
The distinguished twentieth-century British philosopher of law , H.L.A. Hart , argued for a partial version of Mill &apos;s principle . 
Where Mill says that the good of the individual , &quot; either physical or moral , &quot; is &quot; not sufficient warrant &quot; for state interference , Hart says that the individual &apos;s physical good is sufficient warrant , if individuals are likely to neglect their own best interests and the interference with their liberty is slight . 
For example , the state may require us to wear a seatbelt when driving , or a helmet when riding a motorcycle . 
But Hart sharply distinguished such legal paternalism from legal moralism . 
He rejected the prohibition on moral grounds of actions that do not lead to physical harm . 
The state may not , on his view , make homosexuality criminal on the grounds that it is immoral . 
The problem with this argument is that it is not easy to see why legal paternalism is justified but legal moralism is not . 
Defenders of the distinction often claim that the state should be neutral between competing moral ideals , but is such neutrality really possible ? 
If I were a proponent of legal moralism , I would argue that it is , after all , a moral judgment - if a widely shared one - that the value of riding my motorbike with my hair flowing free is outweighed by the risk of head injuries if I crash . 
The stronger objection to the prohibition of homosexuality is to deny the claim that lies at its core : that sexual acts between consenting people of the same sex are immoral . 
Sometimes it is claimed that homosexuality is wrong because it is &quot; unnatural , &quot; and even a &quot; perversion of our sexual capacity , &quot; which supposedly exists for the purpose of reproduction . 
We should beware of equating &quot; natural &quot; with &quot; good . &quot; 
Does the fact that homosexual acts cannot lead to reproduction make them immoral ? 
That would be a particularly bizarre ground for prohibiting sodomy in a densely populated country like India , which encourages contraception and sterilization . 
If a form of sexual activity brings satisfaction to those who take part in it , and harms no one , what can be immoral about it ? 
The underlying problem with prohibiting homosexual acts , then , is not that the state is using the law to enforce private morality .
