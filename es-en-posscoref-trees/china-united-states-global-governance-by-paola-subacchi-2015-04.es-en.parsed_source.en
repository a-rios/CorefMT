American Leadership in a Multipolar World 
LONDON - Giving up the spotlight is never easy . 
The United States , like many aging celebrities , is struggling to share the stage with new faces , especially China . 
The upcoming meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - two institutions dominated by the US and its Western allies - provide an ideal opportunity to change that . 
The US must come to terms with the reality that the world has changed . 
The longer the US remains in a state of denial , the more damage it will do to its interests and its global influence , which remains substantial , if more constrained than before . 
The world no longer adheres to the static Cold War order , with two blocs locked in open but guarded confrontation . 
Nor does it work according to the Pax Americana that dominated in the decade after the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse , when the US briefly emerged as the sole superpower . 
Today &apos;s world is underpinned by a multipolar order , which emerged from the rise of developing economies - most notably China - as major actors in trade and finance . 
The US - not to mention the other G-7 countries - now must compete and cooperate not only with China , but also with India , Brazil , and others through expanded forums like the G-20 . 
To this end , the US must show leadership and adaptability . 
It cannot refuse to support China &apos;s efforts to expand its role in global governance . 
Nor should it issue harsh rebukes to its allies when they do not follow suit , as it did when the United Kingdom announced its intention to join the new China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank . 
The US seems to be stuck in the Bretton Woods system , the rules-based order - underpinned by the IMF and the World Bank , with the US dollar at its heart - that emerged after World War II . 
The Bretton Woods system institutionalized America &apos;s geopolitical supremacy , leaving the old imperial power , the UK , to step aside - a step that it took graciously , if a little desperately , given its grave postwar economic situation . 
Over the years , however , the Bretton Woods system , with its mix of liberal multilateralism and market-oriented economic policies , has come to symbolize the Anglo-American dominance of the global economy that much of the world now criticizes , especially since the global financial crisis . 
In particular , the Washington Consensus - the set of free-market principles that influences the policies of the IMF , the World Bank , the US , and the UK - has generated considerable resentment , especially after the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s . 
Against this backdrop , it is hardly surprising that China has been using its growing global influence to help engineer a new economic order - one in which the US dollar does not reign supreme . 
Zhou Xiaochuan , the governor of the People &apos;s Bank of China , China &apos;s central bank , has repeatedly called for a shift toward an international monetary system that allows for the use of multiple currencies for payments and investment . 
Such an approach would reduce the risk and impact of liquidity crises , while decoupling the international monetary system from the &quot; economic conditions and sovereign interests of any single country . &quot; 
Of course , China believes that its own currency , the renminbi , should eventually play a central role in this new monetary system , so that it reflects China &apos;s role not only as a leading engine of global economic growth , but also as the world &apos;s largest creditor . 
Indeed , together with the other systemically important economies ( the US , the UK , Japan , and the eurozone ) China drives trends that , for better or worse , extend far beyond its borders . 
Since 2009 , China &apos;s leadership has been pursuing a set of policies that encourage the use of the renminbi in regional trade and reduce its dependence on the dollar in international payments . 
China has also spearheaded the establishment of new multilateral institutions , with AIIB following on the heels of the New Development Bank , created with other major emerging economies ( Brazil , Russia , India , and South Africa ) . 
By taking these steps , China &apos;s leaders have called attention to the inadequacy of the existing international monetary system , and its institutional framework , in today &apos;s complex , multipolar world economy . 
In particular , China &apos;s agenda highlights questions about America &apos;s capacity to provide the needed liquidity to support international trade and finance . 
To be sure , the US is right to wonder whether the new order that China hopes to build will be as open and rules-based as the American-led order - the one that gave China the market access it needed to achieve its spectacular economic rise . 
As the US stubbornly pursues a policy of containment toward China - exemplified in its fight against the AIIB &apos;s establishment , its relentless accusations of currency manipulation , and its refusal to ratify IMF reforms that would increase China &apos;s influence - it risks losing its ability to shape what comes next . 
The result could be a world of fragmented blocs - an outcome that would undermine not only global prosperity , but also cooperation on shared challenges . 
The Spring Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank offer an important opportunity to signal a new approach toward China . 
America will be in the spotlight once again .
