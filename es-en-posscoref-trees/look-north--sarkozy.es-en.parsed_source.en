Look North , Sarkozy 
In gearing up to take France on a new economic course , French president Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s choices are not confined to Anglo-American neo-liberalism and the dying French model of social protection . 
There are other viable alternatives , one of which is the German model . 
Germany , after all , is now one of the fastest growing countries in the euro zone . 
So it must be doing something right . 
That &quot; something &quot; is being competitive in world markets . 
German competitiveness did not just happen . 
It took several years for trade union restraint to flower into robust competitiveness , but flower it did . 
Even in the current period of growing optimism about the German economy , the nation &apos;s trade unions are showing themselves to be moderate . 
IG Metall , Germany &apos;s largest industrial union , which bargains for 3.4 million metal , electronics , and car workers , looks ready to accept an estimated 3.3 % annual wage increase for 2007 and 2008 - a settlement generally considered to be &quot; balanced and justifiable . &quot; 
Public sector unions also can affect a nation &apos;s competitiveness in global markets , albeit indirectly . 
In recent years , they too have been co-operative in Germany , though there is some concern that next year &apos;s big wage negotiations could be difficult . 
The German example is highly relevant for France and Sarkozy at this critical juncture . 
Whereas many argue that France can move forward only by adopting the Anglo-American neo-liberal model , Germany &apos;s success clearly demonstrates that the claim that only the free market can produce prosperity is bogus . 
An enlightened corporate state , where unions fully support growth and competitiveness objectives , can deliver the economic goods as well as more de-centralized systems . 
Particularly important for Sarkozy - a politician who wants to get things done - is that the German model can be implemented in France with the right sort of political leadership . 
Transforming France into a second America , on the other hand , is no more than a pie-in-the-sky dream that would be certain to end in failure and disarray - and that few French want in any event . 
There are encouraging initial signs that Sarkozy is ignoring calls from the neo- liberal camp for revolutionary change . 
The fact that he has picked the moderate Francois Fillon as prime minister indicates that he is interested in obtaining real results , and that he thus plans to take the evolutionary route rather than tilting at the windmills of revolutionary change . 
A further lesson for Sarkozy from Germany is that an enlightened corporate state needs supportive political leadership as well as accommodating trade unions . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel doesn &apos;t make speeches attacking the strong euro and the European Central Bank &apos;s price stability mandate . 
On the contrary , she supports an independent ECB and has let Germany &apos;s trade unions and companies know that they will have to live with a strong currency and an anti-inflationary monetary policy . 
This does not mean that Merkel is a free market capitalist - there is little evidence of that . 
Rather , she simply understands that for an economy that needs to stay competitive , bad-mouthing the euro and the ECB sends the wrong signals . 
Sarkozy &apos;s behavior during the presidential campaign was scandalous in this regard . 
He consistently blamed France &apos;s poor export performance on the strong euro , favoring a politically subservient ECB whose mandate should include economic growth as well as price stability . 
His attacks on ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet were often vicious and quite personal . 
They also are at odds with improving French competitiveness . 
Why should the French undertake painful reforms when their newly elected leader has just promised to protect them from a strong currency and further interest rate increases ? 
Why not simply wait for Sarkozy to get the euro down and the ECB to lower interest rates ? 
According to Trichet , Sarkozy has reversed course since winning the election , and no longer will press the ECB to broaden its mandate . 
Let us hope that Trichet is right . 
What Sarkozy has announced so far is his intention to cut income taxes , reform public sector unions , and give tax breaks for overtime work . 
These are precisely the sorts of step-by-step reform measures - both beneficial and feasible - that the new French president should be pursuing . 
Sarkozy &apos;s first foreign trip as France &apos;s new president was to visit Chancellor Merkel . 
Let &apos;s hope that he listened attentively . 
A new Franco-German axis that makes France more competitive is just what Europe needs .
