Furnace Cities 
COPENHAGEN  -  
To peek into the future , all we have to do is go to Beijing , Athens , Tokyo , or , in fact , just about any city on Earth . 
Most of the world &apos;s urban areas have already experienced far more dramatic temperature hikes over the past few decades than the 2.6 ° C increase expected from global warming over the next hundred years . 
It &apos;s simple enough to understand . 
On a hot day in New York , locals sprawl out on the grass fields of Central Park , not on asphalt parking lots or concrete sidewalks . 
Bricks , concrete , and asphalt - the building blocks from which cities are made - absorb much more heat from the sun than vegetation does in the countryside . 
Across an entire city , there &apos;s much more tarmac than there is grass . 
This effect , called an &quot; urban heat island , &quot; was discovered in London in the early 1800 &quot; s . 
Today , the fastest-growing cities are in Asia . 
Beijing is roughly 10 ° C hotter than the nearby countryside in the daytime and 5.5 ° C warmer at night . 
There are even more dramatic increases in Tokyo . 
In August , temperatures there climbed 12.5oC above the surrounding countryside , reaching 40oC - a scorching heat that affected not only the downtown area , but also covered some 8,000 square kilometers . 
Looking at a fast-growing city like Houston , Texas , we can see the real effect of the urban heat island . 
Over the last 12 years , Houston grew by 20 % , or 300,000 inhabitants . 
During that time , the night time temperature increased about 0.8 ° C. Over a hundred-year period , that would translate to a whopping 7 ° C increase . 
But , while celebrity activists warn about the impending doom posed by climate change , a more realistic view is offered by these cities &quot; ability to cope . 
Despite dramatic increases over the past 50 or 100 years , these cities have not come tumbling down . 
Even as temperatures have risen , heat-related deaths have decreased , owing to improved health care , access to medical facilities , and air-conditioning . 
We have far more money and much greater technological ability to adapt than our forebears ever did . 
Of course , cities also will be hit by temperature increases from CO2 , in addition to further warming from urban heat islands . 
But we have an opportunity to act . 
Unlike our forebears , who did very little or nothing about urban heat islands , we are in a good position to tackle many of their effects . 
While celebrity activists focus entirely on cutting CO2 , we could do much more - and at much lower cost - if we addressed urban heat islands . 
Simple solutions can make a vast difference to temperatures . 
Cities are hotter than the land around them because they are drier . 
They lack moist green spaces and have drainage systems that efficiently remove water . 
In London , the air around the River Thames is cooler than it is a few blocks away in built-up areas . 
If we plant trees and build water features , we won &apos;t just beautify our surroundings , but we &apos;ll also cool things down - by upwards of 8 ° C , according to climate models . 
Moreover , although it may seem almost comically straightforward , one of the best temperature-reducing approaches is very simple : paint things white . 
Cities have a lot of black asphalt and dark , heat-absorbing structures . 
By increasing reflection and shade , a great deal of heat build-up can be avoided . 
Paint most of a city and you could lower the temperature by 10 ° C. 
These options are simple , obvious , and cost-effective . 
Consider Los Angeles . 
Re-roofing most of the city &apos;s five million homes in lighter colors , painting a quarter of the roads and planting 11 million trees would have a one-time cost of about $ 1 billion . 
Each year after that , this would lower air conditioning costs by about $ 170 million and provide $ 360 million in smog-reduction benefits . 
And it would lower LA temperatures by about 3 ° C - or about the temperature increase envisioned for the rest of this century . 
Compare that to the $ 180 billion cost of implementing the Kyoto Protocol , which will have virtually no effect . 
At the moment , we don &apos;t hear much about the smartest choices when it comes to addressing global warming . 
That needs to change . 
We do get to choose which future we want .
