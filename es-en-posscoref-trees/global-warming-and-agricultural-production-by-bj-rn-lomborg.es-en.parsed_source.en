The End of Pasta ? 
PRAGUE - Scare stories have been an integral part of the global warming narrative for a long time . 
Back in 1997 , Al Gore told us that global warming was making the El Ni√±o winds stronger and more severe . 
That has not happened . 
Greenpeace and many others have told us for years that we will see more violent hurricanes . 
In fact , over the last six years , global hurricane energy has dropped to its lowest level since the 1970 &quot; s , while the United States has had the longest absence of severe hurricanes ever ( Sandy was a &quot; superstorm , &quot; not a hurricane , when it hit the vulnerable East Coast in October ) . 
But the scares do not stop there . 
The World Wildlife Fund declared in 2004 that polar bears would go extinct by the end of the century , and that the calamity would start in Hudson Bay , where they would stop reproducing by 2012 . 
The bears are still reproducing . 
And stories abound of global warming bringing malaria to Europe or Vermont . 
But here , too , the evidence contradicts such fears ; in fact , malaria deaths have dropped more than 25 % over the last ten years . 
It is understandable that pundits , worried about global warming and frustrated with the near-absence of political interest or solutions , see exaggeration as an easy way to garner attention . 
The problem is that when these scare stories are later shown to be wrong , people become less willing to listen even to reasonable arguments about global warming . 
Indeed , skepticism about global warming has gone up , not down , as the false alarms have become increasingly high-pitched . 
Moreover , by casting every problem as mainly caused by global warming , the solution almost automatically becomes cutting CO2 emissions , though this often is the slowest and costliest way to achieve the least good . 
Consider the newest global-warming exaggeration : an article from Newsweek shrilly claiming that rising temperatures are heralding &quot; The End of Pasta . &quot; 
All of the major grains - rice , corn , and wheat - are already suffering from global warming , the article explains , but wheat is the most vulnerable to high temperatures . 
So , as warming increases , we will see &quot; shockingly high prices &quot; for pasta and bread . 
Its central message is straightforward : &quot; If humans want to keep eating pasta , we will have to take much more aggressive action against global warming . &quot; 
The argument is almost entirely wrong . 
Yields of all major crops have been rising dramatically in recent decades , owing to higher-yielding crop varieties and farmers &quot; greater use of fertilizer , pesticides , and irrigation . 
Moreover , CO2 acts as a fertilizer , and its increase has probably raised global yields more than 3 % over the past 30 years . 
But increasing temperatures will harm some crops while benefiting others . 
Because most crops are already grown where they do best , it is not surprising that climate models show that temperature increases will reduce yields if farmers change little or nothing . 
In fact , farmers will adapt , especially over the course of a century . 
They will plant earlier , grow more heat-loving varieties , or change their crop entirely . 
And , as growing wheat and grains becomes possible higher north in Canada and Russia , even more opportunities will open up . 
The largest study , conducted by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis , includes temperature impacts , CO2 fertilization , and adaptation , and projects a 40.7 % increase in grain production by 2050 . 
Without global warming , production might have been half a percentage point higher . 
With global warming , prices will most likely be slightly lower . 
Our linguine supplies are safe . 
Of course , this does not mean that global warming has no impact on crops . 
Production will move to new varieties and away from the tropics , implying even higher yields for developed countries , but slower growth in yields for developing countries . 
For wheat , it is even likely that parts of Africa simply will be unable to sustain production . 
But cutting back on CO2 is a particularly ineffective way to help the world &apos;s poor and hungry . 
Even if we managed - at very high cost - a significant reduction , we would achieve only a slightly slower rise in global temperatures . 
Meanwhile , by embracing biofuels , for example , we are essentially burning food in our cars , which drives up food prices and exacerbates hunger . 
We could do much more good if we focused on allowing poor countries to use the benefits of extra CO2 fertilization while adapting to the problems caused by higher temperatures . 
That means greater investment in crop research to produce more robust and higher-yielding varieties , as well as making more irrigation , pesticides , and fertilizer available . 
Furthermore , even the poorest parts of the developing world will be much richer by mid-century ; most people will live in cities and earn their incomes outside agriculture . 
As in today &apos;s developed countries , their consumption of wheat will not depend on whether it is produced in their own country , but on global food prices and local income . 
This underscores the importance of striving for free trade , thereby enabling cheaper agricultural production while increasing wages in non-agricultural sectors . 
Global-warming scare stories merely shift our focus to the least effective ways to help .
