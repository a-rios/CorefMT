Belly-Up Brazil ? 
SAO PAULO - After years of impressive growth , Brazil &apos;s economic prospects appear increasingly dim . 
Since the World Cup ended in July , economic activity has plummeted , inflationary pressures have intensified , and consumer and business confidence have collapsed , leading many economists to slash their growth forecasts for this year . 
So just how sick is Brazil &apos;s economy , and how will its malaise affect the outcome of the presidential election in October ? 
At first glance , Brazil &apos;s weak growth appears ephemeral , and President Dilma Rousseff should be well positioned to win a second term . 
Over the last 12 years , her Worker &apos;s Party ( PT ) has delivered the country &apos;s strongest per capita GDP growth in more than three decades ; reduced income inequality with an extensive system of social transfers that reaches one-third of Brazilian households ; and reduced formal unemployment to a record-low 4.5 % . 
But even a cursory look at recent economic data reveals that Brazil &apos;s growth model may well be hitting a stagflationary wall . 
In fact , Brazil most likely experienced a technical recession during the first half of this year . 
And annual growth during Rousseff &apos;s presidency has probably averaged less than 2 % - the slowest for any Brazilian president since the 1980s , when the country began its transition from hyperinflationary basket case and serial defaulter to stable and increasingly prosperous middle-income economy . 
Moreover , had the government not cut taxes and delayed much-needed increases in gasoline and electricity prices , average annual inflation would stand at 7.5 % - a level not reached in decades . 
In services , where the government has taken no measures to suppress inflation , the rate exceeds 9 % . 
Dig deeper , and one finds that the economy &apos;s foundations are plagued with fragilities and imbalances . 
Though overall economic activity is weak , the current-account deficit has reached a 12-year high of 3.5 % of GDP . 
Industrial production is 7 % below its pre-crisis peak in 2008 . 
This , together with the decline in manufactured goods as a share of total exports , from 54 % a decade ago to 37 % today , points to a substantial loss of competitiveness . 
Even the economy &apos;s apparent strengths - a thriving service sector and low unemployment - rest on unsustainable credit policies . 
Of course , rapid credit growth is a natural consequence of declining real interest rates . 
But , in Brazil , lending by state-owned banks has outpaced that of private banks significantly since 2008 , meaning that lending at deeply subsidized rates has largely driven the increase in bank credit , to 58 % of GDP ( roughly double the rate eight years ago ) . 
Against this background , Brazil is preparing for its most important presidential election since its transition from dictatorship to democracy in 1985 - and the polls do not bode well for Rousseff . 
Despite higher incomes and lower inequality , 70 % of Brazilians have expressed a desire for change . 
This is not surprising , in view of the street protests that erupted last year over the poor quality of public services and rising prices . 
But is Rousseff &apos;s government entirely to blame ? 
The short answer is no . 
While Rousseff &apos;s government is largely responsible for the recent bout of cyclical weakness and social upheaval , Brazil &apos;s problems are rooted in a broader unwillingness to shake off the yoke of policies adopted during more than two decades of military rule . 
The 1994 Plano Real , a macroeconomic stabilization program , together with subsequent structural reforms , enabled Brazil finally to quash inflation and ride a wave of cheap global liquidity and surging Chinese demand for commodities . 
As the government attempted to direct these gains toward wealth redistribution , public expenditure rose and the social-benefits system - underpinned by so-called &quot; acquired rights &quot; - became increasingly rigid . 
Brazil needs a new growth model , based on four key elements : tighter fiscal policy , looser monetary policy , a reduced role for state-owned banks in credit provision , and measures to lower Brazil &apos;s astronomical private lending costs . 
The next government , whether of the left or the right , will also face the unenviable task of reforming the acquired-rights system to make social benefits more flexible and affordable . 
Its approach will determine whether Brazil goes the way of Venezuela , which is currently mired in stagflation , or Chile , widely regarded as Latin America &apos;s best-run economy . 
Given the protections afforded to acquired rights , the process of rooting out economic distortions and restoring Brazil &apos;s finances to a stable equilibrium will require a lengthy process of constitutional reform . 
And , though the transition will undoubtedly be painful , it is essential to Brazil &apos;s future economic growth and development . 
Whether or not the next government can do what is needed will depend on its ability to unify the electorate and a disparate group of regionally focused political parties . 
But , first , it must reject the temptingly easy - but ultimately damaging - route of raising taxes and doubling down on redistributive policies . 
That path leads to Venezuela - and to a far less stable and prosperous Latin America .
