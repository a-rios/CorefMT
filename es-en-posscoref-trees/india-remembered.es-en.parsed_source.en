India Remembered 
PARIS - &quot; Do not forget India . &quot; 
That warning made sense 10 or 15 years ago ; not any longer . 
India is now impossible to ignore , much less forget , owing not only to its rapid economic growth , but also to the country &apos;s increasing geopolitical stature . 
Europeans often speak of an emerging &quot; G-3 , &quot; implying an international system dominated by the United States , China , and the European Union . 
But this ambition , however legitimate , looks more presumptuous and unrealistic every day , particularly given the choices that Europe just made in naming its new &quot; President &quot; - Belgium &apos;s Prime Minister Herman van Rompuy - and &quot; Foreign Minister &quot; - the never been elected to anything Lady Catherine Ashton from Britain . How can Europe pretend to stand for an ambitious message when it picks such low-profile - indeed , practically anonymous - messengers to deliver it ? 
Given this demonstration of Europe &apos;s Lilliputian instincts , if a G-3 ever becomes a reality , the only serious contender nowadays to join the US and China is India . 
The very warm greeting and State Dinner given to India &apos;s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh by US President Barack Obama in Washington two weeks ago is ample testimony to India &apos;s new international status . 
That reception was , of course , intended to nurture India &apos;s collective ego , which had sensed a Sino-centric tilt to American policy ever since Obama became president . 
In 1991 , the fall of the Soviet Union presented for India a serious strategic test , which the country has passed with flying colors . 
Partly in response to the Soviet collapse , India embraced capitalism without reservation , which has produced spectacular economic progress . 
And , like the economy , India &apos;s self-confidence has boomed . 
India today sees that the wider world , particularly the West , regards it with growing respect , not only for the country &apos;s performance , but also for its essence - a young country and that is also an ancient civilization . 
A little more than 60 years ago , India remained the crown jewel of the British Empire . 
Today , the books about India include topics like management and nuclear strategy . 
Of course , contrary to China , India still finds it difficult to fully perceive itself as a world power , though it is well aware that it has become a regional giant . 
At least for the foreseeable future , however , this status is highly dependent upon India &apos;s relationship with the US . 
The great diplomatic success of George W. Bush &apos;s presidency ( and maybe the only true one ) was to construct a strategic partnership with India . 
One of the indirect consequences of this privileged relationship , however , has been the deepening of Japan &apos;s identity crisis . 
Forty years ago , Japan represented the &quot; Asian West . &quot; 
Today , the emergence of Chinese-style and Indian-style modernity is mentally destabilizing Japan . 
After all , if China is America &apos;s main economic partner in Asia , and if India is America &apos;s main diplomatic partner , what is left for Japan ? 
Its aging population watches resignedly as the new , younger Asia , becomes as important for the US as Europe was during the Cold War . 
George W Bush &apos;s approach was to view India as the &quot; anti-China , &quot; and thereby to balance the &quot; biggest democracy in the world &quot; against the &quot; oldest civilization in the world . &quot; 
As a result , India &apos;s leaders seem not to have understood the shift towards China in US diplomacy in the first months of Obama &apos;s presidency . 
Why , Indian officials seemed to wonder , change what works , and at a time when the US needs India more than ever ? 
In terms of democracy , there is no competition of course between India and China . 
For example , if Pakistan is to dedicate all of its forces to the fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban , India must convince the Pakistani Army that it need not fear a stab in the back . 
The time has come for India to recognize that with power comes responsibility , and to act like the indispensable nation for regional and world security that it has become . 
The period when India was forgotten or an afterthought is at an end , and with it the period when India could forget about the world .
