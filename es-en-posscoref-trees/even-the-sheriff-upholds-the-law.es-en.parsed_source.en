Even the Sheriff Upholds the Law 
For some time now America has appeared to be intent on discarding the basic ordering instrument of relations between states - international treaties and the institutions that watch over them . 
The Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) treaty with the former Soviet Union banning missile defense has been cancelled . 
A protocol seeking to supervise the prohibition of biological weapons production has been rejected . 
The Kyoto Protocol on climate change has been declared unacceptable to the US . 
The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty - negotiated with major US involvement - has been dismissed . 
The project of an international court of justice is ridiculed and resented . 
Indeed , when Russia demanded that agreed limitations on nuclear strategic warheads be defined in a document binding both Moscow and Washington , the US balked , preferring a vague declaration of principle instead . 
International covenants , the Bush Administration conveyed , are maybe all right for lesser powers - but they are an unacceptable restriction on the freedom of action of the world &apos;s only superpower . 
It is not only America &apos;s enduring willingness to use her unique power in ways generally benign to international stability that should put fears over this trend to rest ; nor the other familiar phenomenon that American administrations tend to start off with ideology before they arrive at pragmatism . 
We are not witnessing a Copernican revision of the orbits of global diplomacy . 
For , although a world without treaties and institutions would hurt most other countries more , it would hurt the mighty US as well . 
The Guantanamo experience on how to treat Taliban and Al-Qaida fighters is a clear case in point . 
In the past , the Geneva Convention prescribed how regular prisoners of war and members of irregular military forces should be treated when apprehended : they are not to be dealt with as criminals . 
At first , US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declared this international agreement inapplicable . 
Soon , however , the Pentagon &apos;s language lost its sharp edge : the problem did not really exist as the captives would be released soon anyway , and were treated well anyway . 
Finally , President Bush announced that Taliban fighters but not Al Qaida terrorists would enjoy the Geneva Convention &apos;s protections . 
The reason for this reversal is obvious : if the US puts the Geneva Convention in doubt , American soldiers , if taken prisoner , could lose their protections . 
Once the US claims the right of redefining or dismissing international treaties as it pleases , it can scarcely blame others if they do so as well . 
Because it is so fragile , international law depends on the support of the most powerful participants in international affairs ; if their commitment is in doubt , it will not be upheld . 
But the ability of powerful nations to exercise their international influence also depends on international law being upheld . 
For its military power , America depends on no one ; for its influence in the world , however , the US continues to depend on the acceptance of other , lesser countries . 
Were the US to opt out of international law , the strongest symbol for a more equitable international system , it would progressively lose influence . 
That is the lesson of Guantanamo . 
It is also the reason why the rest of the world need not worry . 
The US is going through one of its phases of redefining the world , which usually ends with helping the world work . 
American uneasiness about the prevailing body of international law dealing with conflicts is not entirely frivolous . 
Given the new challenges of gobalized insecurity caused , at least in part , by the privatization of force , there is now an urgent task to develop international norms that are relevant to today &apos;s conditions . 
Merely to insist , as some legal purists want , on the sanctity of existing agreements , is not enough ; if they were adequate for past international requirements , this does not mean they are viable in a time when non-state actors are muscling into an arena hitherto monopolized by states . 
So there may be a case for re-examining the Geneva Convention just as there is for looking afresh at the project to establish a permanent international criminal court . 
Since America persists in rejecting the present court proposal ( which has not yet entered into force ) , European governments , instead of sticking to it with equal obduracy , would do better to suggest an ad hoc international court to deal with Al Qaida-type culprits , perhaps attached to the Hague Tribunal now sitting in judgment over the war criminals of the Balkan Wars . 
Creating such a court would demonstrate that acts of international terrorism are an affront to the international community as a whole , not merely to the US . 
It could also help the Bush Administration to come up with a more convincing procedure than the one presently envisaged for honoring the President &apos;s vow to bring the perpetrators of September 11 th to justice . 
International agreements and international law are so essential for coexistence on this crowded globe that not even the most powerful nation can do without them . 
Even in politics it is foolish to oppose logic , and the simple logic of international agreements is that if one party does not honor them , neither will others . 
In the debate over the Guantanamo Bay prisoners and the Geneva Convention America &apos;s realists have , once again , won out over America &apos;s ideologues . 
As if to confirm that the lesson has sunk in , Secretary of State Colin Powell has just informed Russia that the US is ready , after all , to enter a binding treaty on the reduction of nuclear weapons .
