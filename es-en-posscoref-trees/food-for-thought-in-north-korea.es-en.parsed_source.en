Food for Thought in North Korea 
DENVER - Meet any Korean of a certain age , and you will learn about barley season , which begins in February and stretches through the cold months of early spring until the first of the winter barley crop is harvested . 
Few South Koreans remember those straitened months anymore , but for North Koreans , hunger in the countryside during this time of year is very real . 
In past years , South Korea has been the primary external source of food , through either direct food assistance ( for the immediate problem ) or deliveries of fertilizer . 
The past 12 months have seen some of the most outrageous North Korean behavior in decades . 
In March 2010 , a North Korean submarine torpedoed a South Korean ship on the high seas , killing 46 sailors - and sinking any prospect of an early resumption of negotiations to implement the North Korea &apos;s 2005 commitment to eliminate all its nuclear programs . 
North Korean invective and provocation against the South continued , and in November its military shelled a South Korean-held island along the northern limit line , which has served as the North-South border since the 1953 armistice . 
More recently , the regime proudly unveiled a modern , high-tech uranium-enrichment facility . 
According to the American scientist who was invited to see it , the facility , in contrast to the regime &apos;s aging plutonium technology , appeared to be state-of-the-art , thus reinforcing the suspicion that North Korea has no genuine interest whatsoever in fulfilling its nuclear-disarmament responsibilities . 
When asked why they failed to include this facility in their declaration of nuclear programs , North Korean officials responded cheerfully - and absurdly - that it had been built from scratch only after the collapse of the nuclear negotiations in 2008 . 
The North Koreans lied in writing not only to the United States , which it has done repeatedly in the past , but also to China , Russia , Japan , and South Korea . 
The Chinese have urged the US and others to restart the nuclear talks , but they know that it is North Korean perfidy that has jeopardized the process . 
Meanwhile , in the stark North Korean countryside , the regime has invested almost nothing . 
Unmanaged rivers regularly overflow their banks and inundate villages during typhoon season , much as they did a thousand years ago . 
Irrigation systems remain crude and inadequate to confronting the vicissitudes of rainfall on the often parched and barren Korean peninsula . 
This neglect has left North Koreans perpetually on the edge of survival - and often with their palms extended to the international community , especially the South . 
For South Koreans , whether to care for hungry North Koreans , who are kith and kin , will be a much tougher decision than for others who see only a distant security problem . 
Many North Koreans are already malnourished , their body weight and height substantially lower than that of South Koreans . 
According to non-government groups and other humanitarian workers , many North Korean children are showing signs of mental impairment as the lack of essential vitamins takes its toll . 
South Koreans increasingly are coming to believe that North Korea will not be in the family of nations for long - that sooner or later ( perhaps even in this decade ) , the North will collapse and its malnourished people will become future citizens of a reunified Republic of Korea . 
For this reason , the issues facing South Korean public opinion as it decides whether to help with food assistance are not easy ; indeed , they could be quite wrenching . 
The division of the Korean Peninsula 65 years ago was one of the greatest - and now most enduring - tragedies of the Second World War . 
No one dreamed that a line drawn on the 38th parallel for the tactical purpose of organizing the surrender of Japanese units to Soviet and American forces would become a scar across the Korean peninsula that would create two separate states . 
The Korean people have a historical right to determine their peninsula &apos;s future arrangements , including unification should they so choose . 
How this increasingly likely process unfolds will have enormous political and security consequences for the region . 
Will China accept a unified peninsula under a US ally ? 
Will the US take measures to reassure China ? 
How would a unified Korea affect attitudes in Japan ? 
But the real decisions - and their consequences - will fall on the government in Seoul . 
Would food aid help to ensure the survival of a state whose treatment of its own citizens is among the most abysmal in the world ? 
If so , and if denying food aid would result in a famine that the North Korean regime could not withstand , what could such a decision mean for eventual relations among Korean peoples living in the northern and southern parts of a unified country ? 
In the coming weeks , South Korea &apos;s government will confront one of the toughest choices that any government can face : whether the short-term cost in human lives is worth the potential long-term benefits ( also in terms of human lives ) that a famine-induced collapse of North Korea could bring .
