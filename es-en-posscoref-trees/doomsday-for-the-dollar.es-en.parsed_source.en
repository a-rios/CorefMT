Doomsday for the Dollar ? 
The United States &apos; current-account deficit reached 5.7 % of GDP in the second quarter of 2004 . 
Yet the dollar remains at a relatively high value : less than 20 % below its early 2001 highs and more than 10 % higher in real terms than in the early to mid-1990 &apos;s . 
As the US current-account deficit rose over the past half-decade , international economists have lined up to predict doom : returns on assets invested in the US are relatively low , so at some point - probably all at once - holders of dollar-denominated securities will realize that the risk of suffering a major crash in value is not being adequately compensated . 
Once portfolio investors start selling their dollar-denominated securities , a stampede will follow , causing the dollar &apos;s value to crash and triggering the first major global financial crisis of the twenty-first century . 
Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics calls this situation &quot; a disaster in the making . &quot; 
How far will the dollar have to fall ? 
The first historical rule of thumb is 10 % on the dollar for each percent of GDP &apos;s worth of unsustainable current-account deficit . 
The second historical rule of thumb is that currencies on the decline tend to overshoot : near the bottom , international currency speculators require a substantial risk premium out of the fear that the currency crash might trigger something even worse . 
So when will this promised dollar collapse and crisis come ? 
Bergsten says , &quot; Soon . &quot; 
But Bergsten is probably wrong about that . 
The late Rudiger Dornbusch - who used to write this column - used to say that unsustainable situations lasted longer than economists who believed in market rationality and equilibrium could imagine possible . 
In his view , currency overvaluations go through five stages : 
· First , short-term speculators seeking higher returns , or investors overanxious for safety , drive a currency &apos;s value to unsustainable levels . 
· Second , trend-chasers keep buying because the returns have been so good in the recent past , thus pushing the overvaluation to a height and duration that orthodox economists cannot explain . 
· Third , highly intelligent economists , puzzled by the duration of the overvaluation , evolve theories of why things are different this time , and why this time the overvaluation is perhaps sustainable after all . 
· Fourth , market bulls , encouraged by theories of a &quot; new economy &quot; that justify the extraordinarily good returns seen in the recent past , keep buying and keep the currency suspended above economic fundamentals even longer . 
· Fifth , the supply of eager purchasers and trend-chasing investors comes to an end , producing a crash that resembles the collapse of a Ponzi scheme . 
In the past six months , the current round of the US dollar cycle entered stage three . 
Louis Uchitelle of The New York Times quotes the highly intelligent Catherine Mann commenting on the &quot; co-dependent relationship ... between the US and its trading partners , &quot; which might &quot; last for quite some time , &quot; because &quot; the US and its main trading partners have a vested interest in the status quo . &quot; 
Japan , China , and other export-oriented East Asian economies are indeed eager to keep the value of the dollar relatively high , and their central banks have piled up close to $ 2 trillion in dollar-denominated assets . 
China &apos;s government regards the threat of capital losses on its dollar-denominated securities as less important than the need to maintain near-full employment in coastal manufacturing cities like Shanghai . 
After all , the ruling communist oligarchs have grown accustomed to a comfortable lifestyle . 
The last thing they want is mass unemployment and urban unrest to call their positions into question . 
But if international currency speculators get the scent of near-inevitable profits from an ongoing dollar decline in their nostrils , all Asian central banks together will not be able to keep the dollar high . 
Only the Federal Reserve can do that - and the Federal Reserve is very unlikely to sacrifice the jobs of American workers on the altar of the strong dollar . 
There may yet be a soft landing , whether slow or fast : during the last major dollar cycle , between 1985 and 1987 , the dollar fell by 40 % without ever causing panic , major bankruptcies , or a demand by investors for a substantial dollar risk premium to compensate them for holding assets denominated in a declining currency . 
But the historical rule of thumb is that the chances of a fast , hard landing have now surpassed 25 % , and continue to climb .
