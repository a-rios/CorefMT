Bernanke &apos;s the One 
BERKELEY - William McChesney Martin , a Democrat , was twice reappointed to the job of Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve by Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower . 
Paul Volcker , a Democrat , was reappointed once by the Reagan administration ( but not twice : there are persistent rumors that Reagan &apos;s treasury secretary , James Baker , thought Volcker was too invested in monetary stability and not invested enough in producing strong economies in presidential years to elect Republicans ) . 
Alan Greenspan , a Republican , was reappointed twice by Bill Clinton . 
As this history suggests , it is more remarkable for a US president not to reappoint a Fed chairman named by the opposite party than to reappoint one who wishes it . 
Reagan &apos;s failure to reappoint Volcker and Jimmy Carter &apos;s failure to reappoint Arthur Burns are the main exceptions . 
The Fed chairmanship is the only position in the US government for which this is so : it is a mark of its unique status as a non- or not-very-partisan technocratic position of immense power and freedom of action - nearly a fourth branch of government , as David Wessel &apos;s recent book In Fed We Trust puts it . 
The reason , I think , that American presidents are so willing to reappoint Fed chairmen from the opposite party is closely linked to one of the two things that a president seeks : the confidence of financial markets that the Fed will pursue non-inflationary policies . 
If financial markets lose that confidence - if they conclude that the Fed is too much under the president &apos;s thumb to wage the good fight against inflation , or if they conclude that the chairman does not wish to control inflation - then the economic news is almost certain to be bad . 
Capital flight , interest-rate spikes , declining private investment , and a collapse in the value of the dollar - all of these are likely should financial markets lose confidence in a Fed chairman . 
By reappointing a Fed chair chosen by someone else , a president can appear to guarantee financial markets that the Fed is not too much under his thumb . 
But US presidents seek more than just a credible commitment to financial markets that the Fed chair will fear and fight inflation . 
They seek intelligence , honor , and a keen sense of the public interest and the public welfare . 
Presidents &quot; futures - their ability to win re-election , to accomplish other policy goals , and to leave a respectable legacy - hinge on the economy &apos;s strength . 
It may or may not be true , especially these days , that what is good for General Motors is good for America and vice versa , but certainly what is good economically for America is good politically for the president . 
It is here , I think that President Barack Obama has lucked out . 
Ben Bernanke is , I think , a very good choice for Fed chair because he is so intelligent , honest , pragmatic , and clear-sighted in his vision of the economy . 
He has already guided the Fed through two very tumultuous years with only one major mistake - the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers . 
Bernanke &apos;s deep knowledge of the Great Depression and of financial crises is exactly what America - and the world - needs in a Fed chair now .
