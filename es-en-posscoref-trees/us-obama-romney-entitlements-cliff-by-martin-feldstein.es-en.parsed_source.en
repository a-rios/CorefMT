Fixing America &apos;s Fiscal Problem 
CAMBRIDGE - With America &apos;s elections less than six weeks away , it is time to think seriously about what will be done afterwards to deal with the nation &apos;s fiscal mess . 
Regardless of who wins , addressing the problem can no longer be postponed . 
Americans are rightly focused on the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; looming at the start of 2013 , when , under current legislation , virtually all tax rates will rise , sucking more than 3 % of GDP out of households and businesses . 
In addition , automatic cuts in government spending on defense and non-defense programs will subtract nearly another 1 % of GDP in 2013 and similar amounts in future years . 
The Congressional Budget Office warns that falling off the fiscal cliff would push America &apos;s economy into a serious recession next year . 
And the fiscal cliff is only part of the problem that must be solved . 
The bigger problem is that the United States has an enormous fiscal deficit - now about 7 % of GDP and predicted to grow rapidly in future decades as an aging population and rising health-care costs increase government outlays for the &quot; entitlement programs &quot; that benefit middle-class seniors . 
Although politicians on both the left and the right recognize that these programs &quot; growth must be slowed to avoid massive deficits or very large tax increases , their growth is unlikely to slow enough to prevent the national debt / GDP ratio from rising . 
Fiscal consolidation therefore requires additional revenue as well as slower growth in entitlement spending . 
The challenge facing US politicians after the election will be to find a politically acceptable way to raise that revenue without undermining incentives and economic growth . 
The task is made more complex by the large number of legislators who insist that the deficit should be reduced by spending cuts alone . 
Although no one can be sure how this complex problem will be solved , here is my best guess : Soon after the election , the US Congress will vote to postpone the fiscal cliff for about six months to allow time to work out an acceptable legislative solution . 
That solution will involve slowing the growth of Social Security pension benefits for future middle- and upper-income retirees . 
Mitt Romney , the Republican candidate , has explicitly proposed this , and President Barack Obama indicated support for such an approach back in 2009 , before he turned his attention to health care . 
The tougher problem will be how to raise revenue . 
The key will be to focus on the many special features of the tax code that are equivalent to government spending . 
If I buy a hybrid car , install a solar panel at my home , or upgrade to a more efficient water heater , I get a tax credit . 
And if I buy a bigger home or just increase the size of my mortgage , I receive a larger deduction that reduces my taxable income , lowering my tax bill . 
While the government is not giving me money , these special targeted tax breaks are no less &quot; government spending &quot; than they would be if the government sent me a check . 
These features are rightly called &quot; tax expenditures , &quot; because they describe the government spending that occurs through the tax code . 
Eliminating or reducing these tax expenditures should therefore be seen as cutting government spending . 
Although the effect is to raise revenue , that is just an accounting convention . 
The fundamental economic effect is to reduce government spending . 
So the key to raising revenue is to reduce tax expenditures , use some of the resulting revenue to reduce tax rates , and devote the rest to reducing future deficits . 
Opponents of tax increases should see that , because such revenue-raising is really cutting government spending , it does not imply the adverse incentive effects of raising marginal tax rates . 
But even if the intellectual objection to extra revenue can be overcome in this way , the practical political problem is that every large tax expenditure - the home mortgage interest deduction , the exclusion of employer payments for health insurance , etc . - has its fervent defenders . 
So here is an idea that might work politically : Let taxpayers keep all of the current tax expenditures , but limit the total amount by which each taxpayer can reduce his or her tax liability in this way . 
I have explored the idea of &quot; capping &quot; the benefit that individuals can get as a percentage of their total income ( their &quot; adjusted gross income , &quot; or AGI in US tax parlance ) . 
Applying a 2 % -of-AGI cap to the total benefit that an individual can receive from tax expenditures would have a very powerful effect . 
It would not limit the amount of deductions and exclusions to 2 % of AGI , but rather would limit the resulting tax reduction - that is , the tax benefit - that the individual gets by using all these special features . 
For someone with a 15 % marginal tax rate , a 2 % -of-AGI cap would limit total deductions and exclusions to about 13 % of AGI . 
Such a cap would have a significant impact on the fiscal outlook . 
Even if the cap were applied only to &quot; itemized deductions &quot; and the health-insurance exclusion , it would raise about $ 250 billion in the first year and about $ 3 trillion over the first decade . 
There are many options in designing such a policy . 
The cap rate could be higher , or it could start higher and be gradually tightened , or it could vary with an individual &apos;s income level . 
But the economic and political attractiveness of a cap consists in its ability to raise substantial revenue without eliminating specific tax expenditures . 
Fixing America &apos;s fiscal problem will be as difficult as it is important . 
But slowing the growth of Social Security benefits and capping total tax expenditures would be a good framework for the coming reform .
