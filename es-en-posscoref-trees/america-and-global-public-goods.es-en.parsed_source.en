America and Global Public Goods 
America is currently transfixed with the problem it has created for itself in Iraq , but the presidential candidates are also beginning to ask what principles should guide United States foreign policy after Iraq . 
In my view , a focus on global public goods - things everyone can consume without diminishing their availability to others - could help America reconcile its preponderant power with others &quot; interests . 
Of course , pure public goods are rare . 
Most only partially approach the ideal case of clean air , where none can be excluded and all can benefit simultaneously . 
Combating global climate change is probably the most dramatic current case . 
If the largest beneficiary of a public good ( like the US ) does not take the lead in devoting disproportionate resources toward its provision , smaller beneficiaries are unlikely to be able to produce it because of the difficulties of organizing collective action when large numbers are involved . 
While this responsibility often lets others become &quot; free riders , &quot; the alternative is no ride for anyone . 
The US could gain doubly , both from the public goods themselves , and from the way they legitimize its preponderant power in the eyes of others . 
America can learn from the lesson the nineteenth century , when Great Britain was a preponderant power and took the lead in maintaining the balance of power between Europe &apos;s major states , promoting an open international economic system , and maintaining freedom of the seas . 
These issues remain relevant today , and the establishment of rules that preserve access for all remains as much a public good now as it was then , even though some of the issues are more complex . 
Maintaining regional balances of power and dampening local incentives to use force to change borders provides a public good for many ( but not all ) countries . 
Similarly , maintaining open global markets is a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition for alleviating poverty in poor countries even as it benefits the US . 
Today , however , global public goods include new issues - not only climate change , but also preservation of endangered species , outer space , and the &quot; virtual commons &quot; of cyberspace . 
A reasonable consensus in American public opinion supports ensuring both these and the &quot; classic &quot; global public goods , even if the US has failed to lead on some issues , notably global climate . 
There are also three new dimensions of global public goods in today &apos;s world . 
First , the US should take the lead in helping to develop and maintain international laws and institutions to organize collective action to deal with not only trade and the environment , but also weapons proliferation , peacekeeping , human rights , and other concerns . 
Others benefit from the order that such efforts provide , but so does the US . 
Likewise , while unilateralists complain that the US is constrained by international regimes , so are others . 
Second , the US should make international development a higher priority . 
Much of the poor majority of the world is mired in a vicious circle of disease , poverty , and political instability . 
Financial and scientific help from rich countries is important not only for humanitarian reasons , but also to prevent failed states from becoming sources of disorder for the rest of the world . 
Here , too , America &apos;s record is less than impressive . 
Protectionist trade measures often hurt poor countries most , and foreign assistance is generally unpopular with the American public . 
Development will take a long time , and the international community needs to explore better ways to make sure that help actually reaches the poor , but both prudence and a concern for soft power suggest that the US should take the lead . 
Finally , as a preponderant power , the US can provide an important public good by acting as a mediator and convener . 
By using its good offices to mediate conflicts in places like Northern Ireland , Morocco , and the Aegean Sea , the US has helped in shaping international order in ways that are beneficial to other nations . 
The Middle East is the crucial current case . 
It is sometimes tempting to let intractable conflicts fester , and there are some situations where other countries can play the mediator &apos;s role more effectively . 
Even when the US does not want to take the lead , it can share leadership with others , such as with Europe in the Balkans . 
But often the US is the only country that can bring parties together . 
When successful , such leadership increases American soft power while reducing sources of instability . 
The US can also encourage other countries to share in production of such public goods . 
Welcoming the rise of Chinese power in terms of that country &apos;s becoming a &quot; responsible stakeholder &quot; is an invitation to begin such a dialogue . 
Nevertheless , the US is likely to remain the world &apos;s preponderant power even after it extricates itself from Iraq . 
But it will have to learn to work with other countries to share leadership . 
That will require combining the soft power of attraction with the hard power of military might to produce a &quot; smart power &quot; strategy for providing global public goods .
