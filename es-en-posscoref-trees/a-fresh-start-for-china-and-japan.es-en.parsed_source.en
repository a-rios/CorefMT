A Fresh Start for China and Japan ? 
Edmonton - Chinese President Hu Jintao will make a high-profile visit to Japan from May 6-10 , making him the second Chinese head of state ever to travel there . 
The trip is being carefully managed by both countries , and is being watched closely around the world , with good reason : Sino-Japanese relations over the past decade have been turbulent , to say the least . 
When Hu &apos;s predecessor , Jiang Zemin , traveled to Japan ten years ago , bilateral relations were deteriorating : China was unhappy with the Japanese government &apos;s refusal to extend the same apology offered to South Korea for past aggression ; 
The Japanese media &apos;s coverage of the visit was overwhelmingly negative , and it was remembered as a public-relations disaster . 
Hu succeeded Jiang in 2002 , almost as former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was coming to power in Japan , and encouraged &quot; New Thinking &quot; in China &apos;s Japan policy , which would entail moving away from historical grievances and promoting better ties . 
His hard-line approach isolated Japan and angered China , leading to an outburst of anti-Japanese demonstrations in China in 2005 . 
But both Japan and China recognize that further tension will serve neither country &apos;s long-term interests . 
Koizumi &apos;s successors , Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda , have sought to engage China over the past two years , with summits in Beijing and a successful visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to Japan last year . 
Hu &apos;s trip is likely follow the example set by Wen . 
He will emphasize common strategic interests , highlight mutual economic benefits , generate positive public opinion , and promote further exchanges . 
Japan is not only one of China &apos;s largest trade and investment partners , it is also the most powerful neighbor with which China wants to be on good terms , partly to showcase that China &apos;s rise is not a threat to Asia and the rest of the world . 
Japan , whose economic recovery is attributable largely to its deepening ties with China in recent years , is also eager to demonstrate that it regards China not as a threat but as an opportunity , as least in economic terms . 
It was 30 years ago that former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda , the father of today &apos;s prime minister , signed a Peace and Friendship Treaty with China . 
The two governments will certainly use Hu &apos;s visit to celebrate the anniversary with new programs designed to enhance bilateral understanding and friendship . 
But , unlike three decades ago , when the Japanese regarded China as one of their most favored countries , public opinion in both countries nowadays registers more negative feelings than positive ones . 
Behind the smiles , the polite interactions , and the cautiously worded diplomatic language , strong undercurrents of suspicion remain . 
One problem is the disputed waters of the East China Sea . 
Despite new joint projects in energy efficiency and environmental protection , areas in which China ranks Japan as the best performer among industrialized countries , the two sides remain in bitterly divided over these territorial waters , which contain huge potential oil , gas , and other mineral deposits . 
Even after many rounds of talks , no resolution is in sight , and Hu &apos;s visit is not expected to produce any breakthroughs . 
Then there are strategic suspicions . 
Fukuda has dropped Abe &apos;s talk about an &quot; arch of freedom &quot; - an effort to forge a bloc with the United States , Australia , and India . 
But Japan remains concerned about China &apos;s rapidly modernizing military , while China worries about a potential US-Japan containment strategy for China , especially in the case of a crisis in the Taiwan Straits . 
So , although both sides endorse the idea of a &quot; mutually beneficial strategic relationship , &quot; and despite progress bilateral on military exchanges , mutual trust and confidence-building have a long way to go . 
Moreover , today &apos;s &quot; warm politics , cool economics &quot; trend is the reverse of the &quot; cold politics , warm economics &quot; pattern under Koizumi . 
Last year , Japan &apos;s committed investment projects in China fell 24 % from 2006 , while actual investment volume decreased by 25 % , partly owing to regulatory changes in China regarding foreign investment . 
Recent food safety issues , such as the &quot; poisoned dumplings &quot; cases , have clearly heightened the Japanese public &apos;s sensitivity about Chinese exports . 
Finally , historical issues could still resurface to cause new problems . 
While Fukuda has made it clear that he will not visit the Yasukuni Shrine , 160 other parliamentarians paid homage at the site last month , an indication that conservative forces in Japan remain strong and that future prime ministers may not abstain from visiting Yasukuni .
