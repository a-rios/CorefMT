Sweet Caroline in Tokyo 
TOKYO - Fifty years have passed since the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy , with official ceremonies held in Washington , DC , and Dallas to commemorate the anniversary . 
But JFK &apos;s eldest daughter , Caroline Kennedy , was not present at either event ; she had just taken up her post in Tokyo as the 29th US Ambassador to Japan . 
On November 19 , thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Kennedy as she made her way from Tokyo Station to the Imperial Palace , around a kilometer away , by horse-drawn carriage to present her credentials to the emperor . 
Waving to the onlookers , she looked like Snow White . 
November 22 , 1963 , was also the day satellite broadcasting from the United States to Japan began , and many Japanese got up early to watch a speech by JFK in Dallas that began at 5 : 30 a.m. 
The image of young Caroline - the inspiration for Neil Diamond &apos;s famous song - solemnly standing beside her three-year-old brother as he saluted his father &apos;s coffin is deeply engrained in the hearts of Japan &apos;s people . 
So there probably is not a single Japanese who would not welcome her as US Ambassador . 
US ambassadors to Japan have come in three types . 
There have been academic experts on Japan , like the acclaimed scholar Edwin Reischauer . 
There have also been political heavyweights , such as Michael Mansfield , a long-time Democratic majority leader of the US Senate , former Vice President Walter Mondale , former Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas Foley , and Senator Howard Baker , who also served as President Ronald Reagan &apos;s chief of staff . 
The third type are presidential political appointees , such as Thomas Schieffer , a former business partner of President George W. Bush , and John Roos , a noted Silicon Valley lawyer . 
Clearly , Caroline Kennedy , an important early supporter of President Barack Obama , is in this category . 
Indeed , her backing for Obama in the Democratic Party primaries in 2008 , when he was still a relatively unknown senator from Illinois , gave his campaign credibility among party insiders who remain loyal to her family &apos;s legacy . 
Kennedy &apos;s address to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during her confirmation hearing elicited bipartisan support - a rare occurrence nowadays , given America &apos;s highly polarized national politics - and she received unanimous approval . 
Although she lacks formal political or diplomatic experience , her personal connections , particularly to Obama , will have great significance for US-Japan relations . 
And there are pressing issues that need the new ambassador &apos;s attention . 
For example , there are security questions related to strengthening the alliance between Japan and the US , including the relocation of the Futenma Air Station , the base of operations for the US Marine Corps on Okinawa . 
There are also issues related to economic cooperation , such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , the proposed mega-regional free-trade treaty covering Pacific Rim economies . 
Although powerful domestic interest groups , particularly those representing the agricultural sector , have objected to Japanese participation in the TPP negotiations , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s government chose to join the talks late in the day . 
Instead of banking the political capital that his high approval ratings had given him , he chose to spend some of it on an initiative that his predecessors had rejected , but that will help to transform myriad aspects of Japan &apos;s economy . 
Of course , given today &apos;s hyper-partisan environment in the US , there is a danger that fast-track negotiating authority - under which Congress binds itself to an up-or-down vote on trade agreements ( thereby precluding amendments and filibusters ) - will not be given to the president . 
If this roadblock cannot be overcome and the agreement stalls , the Abe government &apos;s approval ratings will suffer , despite progress in the negotiations . 
Given the unanimity with which Kennedy was confirmed , she may be able to use her own political capital to help sell fast-track authority in Congress . 
The Abe government is banking on its high approval rating not only to participate in the TPP , but also to address the need to escape from 15 years of deflation and strengthen Japan &apos;s national-security posture , which has been hamstrung for decades . 
Given the nexus of issues that tie vital US interests to Japan &apos;s reform process , Kennedy , with her character and skills , could well prove to be an essential link between the countries at a crucial point in their relationship .
