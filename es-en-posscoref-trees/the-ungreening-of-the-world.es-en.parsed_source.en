The Ungreening of the World 
Everyone I meet claims to love trees  -  I mean really love trees  -  yet collectively the human race behaves as if it abhors green things . 
If you take a step back from whatever biome you are in at the moment and look at the entire Earth and its forests through recorded history , you will see that the relationship between humans and trees looks Strangely Like War ( the title of a recent book on forests by Derrick Jensen and George Draffan ) . 
The exact extent of the damage is difficult to discern , because for many years records were not kept , but the estimates are that 75 % of the world &apos;s original forests have been logged or burned by humans . 
Some of them have grown back of course , or have been replanted , but it is thought that we now have only half of the amount of forest land we once had on this planet . 
In some places , particularly the drier places of the globe , the deforestation was so severe , and was followed by such intense grazing , that forests have not been able to grow back . 
The landscape has been permanently altered . 
When you imagine Greece , Italy , and Iraq , it is likely that you imagine a dry landscape with open views , the way they look today . 
Historical records indicate , however , that these places were once covered by dense forests . 
The forests fell as civilizations flourished , so the earlier a place became &quot; civilized &quot; the sooner it became deforested . 
This march of so-called progress resulting in the loss of forests was documented by John Perlin in his 1989 book A Forest Journey . 
So today we sit on a planet with only 50 % of its forest cover remaining . 
And here &apos;s the part that should bring tears to your eyes : we continue to lose more forest cover every year . 
The more recent losses are well documented . 
Every five years the United Nations produces a summary report called the Global Forest Resource Assessment ; 
The team in charge of assembling the assessment relies on internet reporting and satellite surveillance to come up with the figures . 
According to the most recent report , between 2000 and 2005 , we lost forest acreage equivalent to the land mass of Panama  -  more than 77 thousand square kilometers of forest gone , some of it never to return . 
The next report is due to be released in 2010 . 
I will not be surprised when it is released and I read that the global forest area has continued to shrink . 
If this happens when we claim to love trees , I shudder to think what would happen if we were ambivalent about them ? 
In the United States , deforestation began as soon as the colonies were settled . 
Before long , the colonies were exporting wood to the many nations that no longer had the timber they needed for ships , casks , shingles , and other construction materials . 
Trees were also cut to clear cropland , provide heat , and the fledgling nation was using up its forests to build its own ironworks and railroads as well . 
By 1920 , more than three-quarters of the US &apos;s original forests had been cut . 
Similar to the global figures , today the US has only half the forest cover that it had in 1600 . 
And we continue to destroy forest land . 
At the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro it was agreed that , &quot; efforts should be undertaken towards the greening of the world . &quot; 
The UN recognizes that &quot; forests are essential to economic development and all forms of life . &quot; 
But the UN Charter also reads : &quot; states have the sovereign right to exploit their own resources . &quot; 
And so we do . 
Although the UN and my country recognize the value of forests , both ecologically and economically , such recommendations are not strong enough to stop my local council from voting &quot; yes &quot; to deforestation . 
Last week , I went to a zoning meeting in the town where I live . 
A real estate housing project developer wanted to cut many acres of trees so he could build houses . 
That forest land will be lost , probably forever , and a few more numbers will be added to the global deforestation total next year . 
Why do local politicians , tree lovers all , allow yet more forest destruction ? 
Why do humans all claim to love trees , but their actions deny their claim ? 
I think it has to do with fear . 
When a would-be exploiter of trees stands before a politician and requests , or demands , the right to clear a forest , the politician , out of fear , complies . 
But we do not fear trees . 
We do not fear their retaliation . 
Trees stand mute despite our betrayal . 
Perhaps that is one of the reasons we really love them . 
But if we want to do more than love them , if we want to save them , we must become fearless .
