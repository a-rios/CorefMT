Obama &apos;s Russian Roadblock 
MOSCOW - In a recent speech in Berlin , US President Barack Obama reaffirmed his commitment to nuclear disarmament and proposed steps toward achieving that goal . 
But Russia has made clear that it does not plan to pursue further reductions to its nuclear arsenal any time soon . 
In the speech - delivered nearly 50 years after President John F. Kennedy addressed the then-divided city , highlighting the value of arms control between adversaries - Obama announced that the United States is prepared to cut its nuclear arsenal by up to one-third . 
He also proposed major reductions in the number of tactical nuclear weapons ( TNWs ) deployed in Europe . 
Moreover , he called upon the international community to renew its efforts to prevent Iran and North Korea from developing nuclear weapons ; to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the proposed Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty into force ; and to make nuclear energy safer . 
Three years ago , Russia seemed to share Obama &apos;s aspiration to move beyond Cold War nuclear postures , with both countries agreeing to limit their deployed weapons to 1,550 as part of the New Strategic Arms-Reduction Treaty . 
In fact , Russia considers New START to be a &quot; gold standard &quot; treaty , based on core principles - modest and balanced reductions over an extended time period , adequate but not excessive verification measures , and recognition of the connection between strategic offense and defense - that should be applied to all future arms-control treaties . 
But Russian officials have since reaffirmed their hardline position , stating in various settings - including at the recent European Security Conference in Moscow - that Russia will not consider further cuts to its nuclear arsenal until the US addresses certain issues affecting Russian interests . 
In fact , many of the Kremlin &apos;s demands may well be beyond the Obama administration &apos;s capacity to deliver . 
One of Russia &apos;s main concerns is America &apos;s efforts to build up its ballistic missile defense system ( BMDS ) . 
Although experts have disputed the capacity of America &apos;s BMDS , Russian leaders remain convinced that it could seriously undermine Russia &apos;s nuclear deterrent . 
Russian officials intimate that the US is using the threat of a North Korean or Iranian attack on the US with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles as a pretext to erect defenses against Russia ( and probably China ) . 
Despite Obama &apos;s assurances ( and those of his predecessors ) , Russia asserts that America &apos;s BMDS is actually intended to expand NATO &apos;s role in Europe , complicate Russian diplomacy , and facilitate US military interventions . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has even warned that , left unchallenged by Russia &apos;s nuclear deterrent , the US would be tempted to intervene militarily in more countries , as it did in the former Yugoslavia , Iraq , and Libya . 
These concerns have driven Russia to demand that the US sign a binding treaty that limits the speed , location , and capabilities of its missile defenses and includes mandatory transparency provisions - even as Russian officials acknowledge that the US Senate would never ratify such a treaty . 
Another issue constraining nuclear disarmament is Russia &apos;s view that , without nuclear weapons , its military capabilities would be no match for the conventional forces of the US and NATO . 
Indeed , many in Russia worry that a US attack against Russia &apos;s nuclear deterrent and other defense assets that relies on America &apos;s growing stock of long-range , precision-guided conventional weapons would be as devastating as a nuclear strike . 
These fears are exacerbated by Obama &apos;s declared intention to work alongside NATO in seeking to reduce by as many as 5,000 Russia &apos;s arsenal of TNWs - which dwarfs NATO &apos;s holdings of roughly 200 - and to have the remaining warheads relocated away from NATO members &quot; territory . 
Many in Russia view their country &apos;s dominance in this area as essential to offsetting imbalances in conventional weaponry . 
In fact , no formal arms-control treaty directly covers these non-strategic weapons ; nor have they been the subject of targeted NATO-Russia negotiations . 
And , as long as the US has TNWs deployed near Russia &apos;s border , Russian officials insist they will not initiate such talks . 
Even if the US managed to get Russia to the negotiating table , convincing it to accept sizable cuts in its TNWs arsenal could require the US to fulfill additional demands , such as limiting NATO &apos;s military concentrations and facilities near Russia &apos;s periphery and resurrecting the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe on the Kremlin &apos;s terms.Moreover , Russian leaders demand that other nuclear-armed states accept comparable limits on their TNWs stocks . 
Indeed , Russia wants to replace the predominately bilateral nuclear arms-control processes of the last 50 years with multilateral negotiations aimed at constraining the offensive capabilities of other nuclear states , including the United Kingdom , France , and China - and maybe other countries . 
But convincing these states to participate in arms-reduction negotiations , much less to accept new constraints on their relatively small nuclear arsenals , would be difficult . 
Like the Obama administration , they believe that the next round of cuts should focus on Russia and the US , which still possess almost all the world &apos;s nuclear weapons . 
The fundamental challenge is that Russia &apos;s leaders do not share Obama &apos;s aversion to nuclear weapons . 
On the contrary , they believe that , while the likelihood of a nuclear war has fallen sharply since the end of the Cold War , nuclear deterrence has become more valuable for Russia and other countries that are outmatched by America &apos;s conventional military power . 
This might prove to be an insurmountable obstacle to realizing the Obama administration &apos;s vision of a nuclear-weapons-free world .
