What Happened to Mohamed al-Hanashi ? 
NEW YORK - Mohammed al-Hanashi was a 31-year-old Yemeni citizen who was held at Guantánamo Bay without charge for seven years . 
On June 3 , while I was visiting Guantánamo with other journalists , the press office there issued a terse announcement that al-Hanashi had had been found dead in his cell - an &quot; apparent suicide . &quot; 
Because my commercial flight was canceled , I got a ride back to the United States on a military transport . 
I happened to be seated next to a military physician who had been flown in to do the autopsy on al-Hanashi . 
When would there be an investigation of the death , I asked him ? 
&quot; That was the investigation , &quot; he replied . 
The military had investigated the military . 
This &quot; apparent suicide &quot; seemed immediately suspicious to me . 
I had just toured those cells : it is literally impossible to kill yourself in them . 
Their interiors resemble the inside of a smooth plastic jar ; there are no hard edges ; hooks fold down ; there is no bedding that one can use to strangle oneself . 
Can you bang your head against the wall until you die , theoretically , I asked the doctor ? 
&quot; They check on prisoners every three minutes , &quot; he said . 
You &apos;d have to be fast . 
The story smelled even worse after a bit of digging . 
Al-Hanashi , it turned out , had been elected by the detainees to serve as their representative . 
( The Geneva Conventions call for this process but the US did not give it any formal recognition ) . 
As their designated representative , al-Hanashi knew which prisoners had claimed to have been tortured or abused , and by whom . 
On January 17 , al-Hanashi , according to his fellow prisoner Binyam Mohamed ( who has since been released ) , was summoned to a meeting with the Admiral of Guantánamo and the head of the Guard Force there . 
He never returned to his cell . 
He was taken to the psychiatric ward , where , according to another prisoner who had been there , he was kept until he died . 
Can you kill yourself in the psych ward ? 
According to Cortney Busch of Reprieve , a British organization that represents Guantánamo detainees , there is video running on prisoners in the psychiatric ward at all times , and there is a guard posted there continually , too . 
The day after al-Hanashi died , the nurse and psychologist had shown a group of journalists of which I was a part an oddly defensive display of how hunger-striking prisoners are bound in restraint chairs when being &quot; enterally fed &quot; ( that is , force-fed ) . 
Al Hanashi , the press office at Guantánamo noted , had formerly been a hunger striker . 
It is worth considering how easy it would be to do away with a troublesome prisoner being force-fed by merely adjusting the calorie level . 
If it is too low , the prisoner will starve , but too high a level can also kill , since deliberate liquid overfeeding by tube , to which Guantánamo prisoners have reported being subjected , causes vomiting , diarrhea , and deadly dehydration that can stop one &apos;s heart . 
I have been putting questions to Lt. Commander Brook DeWalt , the head spokesman for the Guantánamo press office , about how al-Hanashi died , for eight weeks now . 
According to the Yemeni embassy in Washington , al-Hanashi &apos;s body was repatriated in mid-August . 
Al Jazeera has reported that the Yemeni government announced only what the US had - that al-Hanashi had died from &quot; asphyxiation . &quot; 
When I noted to DeWalt that self-strangulation was impossible , he said he would get back to me when the inquiry - now including a Naval criminal investigation - was completed . 
I have yet to receive an answer . 
The Yemeni government , too , notes that they have yet to receive the coroner &apos;s report from the US . 
An investigation by the military of the death of its own prisoners violates the Geneva Conventions , which demand that illness , transfer , and death of prisoners be registered independently with a neutral authority ( such as the ICRC ) , and that deaths be investigated independently . 
If governments let no outside entity investigate the circumstances of such deaths , what will keep them from &quot; disappearing &quot; whomever they take into custody , for whatever reason ? 
I sent DeWalt a copy of the relevant section of the Geneva Conventions and asked how the US military &apos;s handling of al-Hanashi &apos;s death conforms to it . 
Actually , I sent it twice . 
Again , no answer . 
Was al-Hanashi suicidal ? 
Binyam Mohamed told the Associated Press that al-Hanashi was a positive person ( and , one can assume , a natural leader ) who would never consider suicide . 
He had been in custody for seven years without a lawyer , and killed himself just two weeks after having finally been assigned one ? 
That lawyer , Elizabeth Gilson , probably knows al-Hanashi &apos;s state of mind before he died , but the US government will not allow her to talk about it . 
What happened to Mohamed al-Hanashi , and why ? 
The fact that no one can answer this question yet means that even in Barack Obama &apos;s America , as in Stalin &apos;s Russia or Ahmadinejad &apos;s Iran , people can simply be disappeared without trial . 
The world &apos;s law-abiding governments and ordinary citizens should call and email DeWalt , the Pentagon , and the White House press office to demand answers . 
A young man with a great deal of potentially compromising information died under suspicious circumstances in US custody . 
The facts concerning his case must be independently verified .
