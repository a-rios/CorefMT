Remembering Gaza 
LONDON - Government is all about statistics , but life is about people . 
That disjunction explains a lot about the cynicism and disaffection with politics that characterizes much of the world nowadays . 
And , while domestic problems may seem intractable , distance increases the confusion and fatigue induced by seemingly intractable international problems . 
As usual , the people who suffer are those who most need the world &apos;s attention . 
This is notably true of the 1.5 million people crowded into the Gaza strip , locked between Israel , Egypt , and the Mediterranean Sea . 
The West has already isolated Gaza &apos;s Hamas-controlled government . 
This week , the US Congress will discuss cutting off aid to the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority . 
But this is a time for more international engagement with the Palestinian people , not less . 
The statistics say that 80 % of Gaza &apos;s population is dependent on UN food aid . 
The youth unemployment rate is 65 % . 
The Web site of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has a comprehensive database that shows how many trucks , containing different kinds of supplies , have been allowed in by the Israeli authorities . 
The situation of the people - or rather the fight about their situation - is periodically in the news , most recently when violence broke the otherwise reasonably effective ceasefire in August . 
But Gaza has become the land that time - and the wider international community - forgot . 
It is for this reason that I took up the offer from Save the Children to visit the Gaza Strip last week . 
I had not been able to visit while serving in government for security reasons . 
Now I wanted to get a sense of life , not statistics . 
The purpose of the visit was not to meet politicians or decision makers , but to get a glimpse , albeit brief , of how people there live . 
And there is real life . 
Boys in Western football shirts - mainly Lionel Messi of Barcelona . 
Schoolgirls in white headscarves wherever you look . 
Barbers , clothes shops , fruit stalls . 
And a good deal of traffic - with new cars smuggled in through tunnels beneath the &quot; Philadelphi Route &quot; that runs along the Egyptian border . 
But real life is also traumatic and limited . 
We saw buildings - not just the former Hamas headquarters - still in rubble . 
Houses are riddled with bullet holes . 
There is no electricity for up to eight hours a day . 
Shortages of schools and teachers have pushed class sizes to 50 or 60 , and the school day is restricted to a few hours to allow for two or even three shifts . 
The consequences of war are encountered everywhere , nowhere more so than for those caught in the crossfire . 
We met the niece and son of a farmer caught in the &quot; buffer zone &quot; between the Israeli border and Gaza . 
She had lost an eye and he a hand to Israeli shells in the war of 2008-2009 . 
Save the Children , obviously , is most concerned about the 53 % of Gaza population that is under 18 . 
The statistics say 10 % of children are &quot; stunted &quot; - so undernourished before the age of two that they never grow to their full potential . 
We saw what Save the Children is trying to do about it , at a nutrition center serving mothers and children in Gaza City . 
The needs are basic : promoting breastfeeding , food supplies for young children , and medical attention for mothers . 
But not all those who need help are coming to get it , so Save the Children funds outreach workers to encourage families to use the services . 
There is remarkable work being done to create opportunities , as well as to prevent catastrophe . 
The Qattan Center for the Child is a privately funded library - and drama , computer , and youth center - that would grace any British community . 
The director told me it is dedicated to the credo of &quot; building people not buildings . &quot; 
The center is a true oasis . 
The situation surrounding such oases represents the ultimate failure of politics . 
After the war ended in January 2009 , the international community was preoccupied with opening up Gaza . 
Nearly three years later , there is only stalemate - to match the wider stalemate in the search for a Palestinian state that can live alongside Israel . 
The responsibility lies , first and foremost , with Israel . 
The UN &apos;s Gaza peace resolution ( which Britain authored ) calls on the Israeli government to open up the supply lines , but this has been heeded only in small part . 
That is why the tunnels do such a roaring trade , which Hamas taxes to fund its activities . 
The Israeli government would retort that the parallel call in the resolution for a halt to the flow of arms into Gaza also has not been heeded . 
That is true , too . 
Yet the international pressure is muted . 
The focus has shifted . 
But Gaza &apos;s people and their needs remain in what British Prime Minister David Cameron last year called an &quot; open prison . &quot; 
Surely there is room across divides of party and nation to address these pressing humanitarian needs , which otherwise would only fuel future political trouble . 
What makes the situation in Gaza even more infuriating is that the status quo is actually irrational . 
It is not in anyone &apos;s political interest . 
Israel doesn &apos;t become safer , nor do Hamas or Fatah become more popular . 
One young mother at the nutrition center told me that she was just completing her accountancy degree - but there was no work . 
Yusuf , age nine , working on a computer at the Qattan Center , told me that he wanted to be a pilot . 
These people are not a threat to peace in the Middle East . 
They are actually its hope . 
What they need is a chance to shape their own futures .
