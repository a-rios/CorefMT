Bringing the Chinese Consumer to Life 
BEIJING - History will be the ultimate judge , but there is good reason to believe that China &apos;s recently completed Third Plenum will come to be regarded as a pivotal moment in the country &apos;s development . 
At long last , China &apos;s senior leadership has endorsed a raft of reforms that could impel the economy &apos;s shift from reliance on exports to consumption-led growth . 
Until now , this transformation was framed in terms of broad goals and aspirations . 
For example , the 12th Five-Year Plan , adopted in March 2011 , promised the emergence of a consumer-led economy , resting on the building blocks of urbanization and the development of an embryonic services sector . 
Notwithstanding the importance of these commitments in setting out opportunities for China &apos;s middle class , they lacked a critical component : incentives for Chinese families to convert their newfound income into discretionary consumption . 
On the contrary , financial and economic insecurity has gripped Chinese households since the &quot; iron rice bowl &quot; - the cradle-to-grave support that the socialist state offered workers and their families - was discarded in the late 1990 &quot; s . 
Fearing for the future , households have hoarded incremental income , rather than spending it on consumer goods . 
Economists call that precautionary saving . 
China &apos;s leaders called it frustrating . 
The reforms endorsed by the Third Plenum focus on this wedge between income and consumption , offering specific proposals aimed at altering the behavior of fear-driven Chinese families . 
Especially important is the proposal to channel 30 % of the profits of state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) - currently running at close to $ 400 billion - into the country &apos;s woefully under-funded social safety net . 
China &apos;s national health-insurance plan , for example , boasts nearly universal coverage , but the benefits it provides are negligible . 
The same is true of China &apos;s retirement system : the workforce &apos;s enrollment rate is around 50 % , but only $ 600 of assets per worker ( in national , local government , and private pension schemes , combined ) are available to cover lifetime retirement benefits . 
Little wonder that Chinese families , fearful of such an uncertain future , save to excess . 
An adequately funded safety net could go a long way in tempering the expectations underlying this behavior . 
Several other measures proposed at the Third Plenum seek to shift Chinese families &quot; behavioral norms . 
A major reconsideration of the one-child policy is especially important , given the need to relieve pressures arising from the inevitable decline in China &apos;s working-age population . 
Reform of the hukou ( residency permit ) system to allow citizens to transfer their welfare benefits from one city to another is vital for an increasingly flexible labor force that now includes almost 200 million migrant workers . 
China &apos;s consumers should also draw comfort from the likely move to market-based deposit rates on their savings accounts , which will reinforce incremental growth in wage income . 
This long overdue policy shift is an important component of the Third Plenum &apos;s official elevation of market-based pricing as the &quot; decisive &quot; mode of resource allocation in China . 
The word &quot; decisive &quot; holds important implications for key resources - including fuels , financial capital , and , of course , the currency - that historically have been subject to state-administered pricing . 
Rhetorical flourishes have always been an important signaling mechanism for major policy changes - think of Deng Xiaoping &apos;s &quot; reforms and opening up &quot; of the late 1970 &quot; s . 
The Third Plenum &apos;s use of &quot; decisive &quot; to anchor a market-based approach is a similar gambit . 
All of this casts modern China &apos;s development strategy in a new light . 
Beginning with Deng in the late 1970 &quot; s , scientists and engineers - technocrats with the determination to convert a dysfunctional centrally planned economy into an investment- and export-led colossus - framed and implemented a producer-oriented development model . 
Today , the task at hand is very different : to transform the technocratic framework of the producer model into the aspirational vision of a flourishing consumer society . 
The need to navigate this shift raises the toughest question of all : Is the new &quot; fifth-generation &quot; Chinese leadership , headed by President Xi Jinping , up to the challenge ? 
There are three reasons to believe that it is . 
First , the role of technocrats in China &apos;s senior leadership is on the wane . 
Research by Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution reveals that only about 15 % of the current 25 Politburo members are engineers and scientists , down from 40 % in 2007 and 72 % in 2002 . 
Li &apos;s analysis points to the related ascendance of senior officials trained in law and the social sciences - providing a skill set that is more closely aligned with the vision of a consumer society . 
Second , the Third Plenum established a new high-level organization - the so-called Central Leading Group on Reforms . 
This small group , likely to be headed by Xi , will play the key role in drafting specific guidelines for implementing the Plenum &apos;s proposed reforms - thus threatening to marginalize the long-dominant technocrats of the National Development and Reform Commission , the heir to the old State Planning Commission . 
Finally , Xi &apos;s power base is far broader than that of his two predecessors , Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao , both of whom had shaky transitions in the first years of their leadership . 
Unlike Jiang and Hu , Xi assumed quick command of the Chinese Communist Party , the government , and the military , and very effectively shepherded the Third Plenum &apos;s historic reforms . 
As always , proof will come only with implementation . 
But with China &apos;s leaders now focusing squarely on aligning the vast population &apos;s behavioral norms with the next phase of transformation , the case for a consumer-led China has become more compelling than ever .
