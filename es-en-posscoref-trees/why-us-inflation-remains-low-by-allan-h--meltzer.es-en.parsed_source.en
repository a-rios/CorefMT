When Inflation Doves Cry 
PITTSBURGH - The Wall Street Journal recently ran a front-page article reporting that the monetary-policy &quot; doves , &quot; who had forecast low inflation in the United States , have gotten the better of the &quot; hawks , &quot; who argued that the Fed &apos;s monthly purchases of long-term securities , or so-called quantitative easing ( QE ) , would unleash faster price growth . 
The report was correct but misleading , for it failed to mention why there is so little inflation in the US today . 
Were the doves right , or just lucky ? 
The US Federal Reserve Board has pumped out trillions of dollars of reserves , but never have so many reserves produced so little monetary growth . 
Neither the hawks nor the doves ( nor anyone else ) expected that . 
Monetarists insist that economies experience inflation when money-supply growth persistently exceeds output growth . 
That has not happened yet , so inflation has been postponed . 
Instead of rejecting monetary theory and history , the army of Wall Street soothsayers should look beyond the Fed &apos;s press releases and ask themselves : Does it make sense to throw out centuries of experience ? 
Are we really so confident that the Fed has found a new way ? 
The Fed has printed new bank reserves with reckless abandon . 
But almost all of the reserves sit idle on commercial banks &quot; balance sheets . 
For the 12 months ending in July , the St. Louis Fed reports that bank reserves rose 31 % . 
During the same period , a commonly used measure of monetary growth , M2 , increased by only 6.8 % . 
No sound monetarist thinks those numbers predict current inflation . 
Indeed , almost all the reserves added in the second and third rounds of QE , more than 95 % , are sitting in excess reserves , neither lent nor borrowed and never used to increase money in circulation . 
The Fed pays the banks 0.25 % to keep them idle . 
With $ 2 trillion in excess reserves , and the prospect of as much as $ 85 billion added each month , banks receive $ 5 billion a year , and rising , without taking any risk . 
For the bankers , that &apos;s a bonanza , paid from monies that the Fed would normally pay to the US Treasury . 
And , adding insult to injury , about half the payment goes to branches of foreign banks . 
In normal times , there are valid reasons for paying interest on excess reserves . 
Currently , however , it is downright counter-productive . 
Bank loans have started to increase , but small borrowers , new borrowers , and start-up companies are regularly refused . 
Current low interest rates do not cover the risk that banks would take . 
To be sure , they could raise the rate for new and small borrowers ; but , in the current political climate , they would stand accused of stifling economic recovery if they did . 
The new Consumer Financial Protection Board is also a deterrent , as banks consider it safer to lend to the government , large corporations , and giant real-estate speculators . 
The banks can report record profits without much risk , rebuild capital , and pay dividends and bonuses . 
And the Fed can congratulate itself on the mostly unobserved way that the large banks have used taxpayers &quot; money . 
Instead of continuing along this futile path , the Fed should end its open-ended QE3 now . 
It should stop paying interest on excess reserves until the US economy returns to a more normal footing . 
Most important , it should announce a strategy for eliminating the massive volume of such reserves . 
I am puzzled , and frankly appalled , by the Fed &apos;s failure to explain how it will restore its balance sheet to a non-inflationary level . 
The announcements to date simply increase uncertainty without telling the public anything useful . 
Selling $ 2 trillion of reserves will take years . 
It must do more than repeat that the Fed can raise interest rates paid on reserves to encourage banks to hold them . 
It will take a clearly stated , widely understood strategy - the kind that Paul Volcker introduced in 1979-1982 - to complete the job . 
Should the end of QE come in September , December , or later ? 
Does it matter ? 
Historically , the Fed has typically been slow to respond to inflation . 
Waiting until inflation is here , as some propose , is the usual way . 
But that merely fuels inflation expectations and makes the task more painful . 
And how high will the Fed push up interest rates ? 
Once rates get to 5 % or 6 % , assuming inflation remains dormant , the Fed can expect a backlash from Congress , the administration , unions , homebuilders , and others . 
When contemplating the consequences of this , remember that 40 % of US government debt comes due within two years . 
Rolling it over at higher rates of 4 % or 5 % would add more than $ 100 billion to the budget deficit . 
And that is just the first two years . 
The budget cost increases every year , as more of the debt rolls over - and that does not include agency debt and the large increase in the current-account deficit to pay China , Japan , and other foreign holders of US debt . 
Those who believe that inflation will remain low should look more thoroughly and think more clearly . 
There are plenty of good textbooks that explain what too many policymakers and financial-market participants would rather forget .
