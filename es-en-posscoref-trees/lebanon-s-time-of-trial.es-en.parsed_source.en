Lebanon &apos;s Time of Trial 
ISTANBUL - As Lebanon braces for the possible indictment of Hezbollah operatives for the murder of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , the country &apos;s economy is wobbling . 
The International Monetary Fund &apos;s Mission Report of March 2009 , pointing to the country &apos;s 30 years of chronic political tumult , concluded that &quot; Lebanon will remain vulnerable to shocks for many years &quot; to come . 
While welcoming the anti-crisis action plan of the government at that time , the Fund held no illusion that it would be up to the task . 
Later that year , however , the government of Saad Hariri , Rafik Hariri &apos;s son , brought new hope , prompting the IMF to declare that it had &quot; opened a new window of opportunity for invigorating economic reforms . &quot; 
But the success of the planned reforms depends heavily on cooperation between Lebanon &apos;s main political groups , the Sunni and the Shia , and there has been little of that so far . 
Indeed , the influence of outside powers remains a central part of the equation . 
It remains unclear whether or not that goal was fulfilled . 
Meanwhile , Lebanon &apos;s main economic indicators show steady improvement : GNP increased from $ 21 billion in 2004 to $ 32 billion in 2009 , inflation remains under control , foreign trade is balanced , and the unemployment rate is tolerable . 
Moreover , the Lebanese pound is pegged to the US dollar . 
But , although the World Bank classifies Lebanon as an &quot; upper middle income &quot; country , with a per capita GNP of $ 10,800 , 28 % of the population lives below the poverty line . 
As many of Lebanon &apos;s poorest are Shia , this provides fertile ground for Hezbollah recruiters . 
Other economic shadows remain , with serious potential political implications . 
The IMF forecasts that the Hariri government should be able to tap capital markets to cover its financial needs for 2010 . 
The issue is not so much where the funds will come from as the amount itself . 
Lebanon &apos;s growth rate , which has averaged 3.7 % over the last 10 years , has been , according to the Fund , &quot; lower and more volatile than ( averaged ) in the MENA &#91; Middle East-North Africa &#93; region . &quot; 
Under these conditions , it is difficult to see how the country can ever offset the damage caused by the various wars of the 1975-2006 period , estimated to have caused $ 35 billion in damage . 
The &quot; emergency post-conflict assistance &quot; ( under $ 100 million ) provided by the IMF after the 2006 fighting with Israel fell well short of the amount needed to rebuild . 
The Lebanese government has been boasting about the US aid that it has received . 
Moreover , although the World Bank accepted the country &apos;s reconstruction program - called &quot; Horizon 2000 &quot; - the money for it , from the European Investment Bank and Arab funds , has barely trickled in . 
In order to get further assistance , Lebanon urgently needs to strengthen its ties with the US , as well as those that it has been developing within the framework of EU Mediterranean Cooperation . 
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan , as part of his recent drive to become the de facto leader of the Sunni world , and as part of his &quot; zero problems with neighbors &quot; policy , has lifted visa requirements for Lebanese traveling to Turkey . 
Worse , a bilateral free-trade agreement has not been finalized , despite seven years of negotiations . 
Yet this did not deter Turkey from organizing the Third Turkish-Arab Forum on July 10 , 2010 , with Syria , Jordan , and Lebanon . 
After much old-style &quot; Nasserite &quot; rhetoric , they decided to create the Close Neighbors Economic and Trade Association Council . 
While Turkey &apos;s objective is a free-trade zone and economic integration between the four countries , Lebanon has been much more cautious . 
The Web site of its Ministry of Economy and Trade does not even mention such a plan ( but does quote the Arab League &apos;s anti-Israel Central Boycott Office ) . 
The four countries will hold their next meeting in Damascus this coming December to decide on further steps . 
Moreover , in 2009 , the Lebanese set World Trade Organization membership as a priority , and the proposed new free-trade agreement may not advance that goal . 
Turkey , for its part , finds itself in a similar situation with its candidacy for the EU . 
Hariri &apos;s government is set to keep its 71-member majority in Lebanon &apos;s 128-seat parliament , helped by the 8 % economic growth projected for this year .
