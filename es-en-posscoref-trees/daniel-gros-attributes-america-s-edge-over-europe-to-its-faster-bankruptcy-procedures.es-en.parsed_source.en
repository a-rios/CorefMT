The Transatlantic Growth Gap 
BRUSSELS - The global financial crisis that erupted in full force in 2008 affected Europe and the United States in a very similar way - at least at the start . 
On both sides of the Atlantic , economic performance tanked in 2009 and started to recover in 2010 . 
But , as the financial crisis mutated into the euro crisis , an economic gulf opened between the US and the eurozone . 
Over the last three years ( 2011-2013 ) , the US economy grew by about six percentage points more . 
Even taking into account the increasing demographic differential , which now amounts to about half a percentage point per year , the US economy has grown by about 4.5 percentage points more over these three years on a per capita basis . 
The main reason for the gap is the difference in private consumption , which grew in the US , but fell in the eurozone , especially in its periphery . 
A retrenchment of public consumption actually subtracted more demand in the US ( 0.8 percentage points ) than in the European Union ( 0.1 points ) . 
This might appear to be somewhat surprising in light of all of the talk about Brussels imposed austerity . 
In fact , public consumption in the eurozone has de facto remained fairly constant over the last three years , whereas it has declined substantially in the US . 
( The same is true of public investment , though this constitutes such a small proportion of GDP that transatlantic differences could not have had a large impact on growth over a three-year horizon . ) 
The contraction of private investment in Europe accounts for only a small part ( one-third ) of the growth gap . 
Though the financial-market tensions that accompanied the euro crisis had a strong negative impact on investment in the eurozone periphery , investment demand has also remained weak in the US , minimizing the overall difference . 
The resilience of private consumption in the US , the key to the growth gap , is not surprising , given that American households have reduced their debt burden considerably from the peak of more than 90 % of GDP reached just before the crisis . 
The lower debt burden is also a key reason why consumption is expected to continue to grow much faster in the US than in the eurozone this year and next . 
But the crucial question - and one that is rarely asked - is how US households were able to reduce their debt burden during a period of high unemployment and almost no wage gains while sustaining consumption growth . 
The answer lies in a combination of &quot; no recourse &quot; mortgages and fast bankruptcy procedures . 
Millions of American homes that were purchased with subprime mortgages have been foreclosed in recent years , forcing their owners , unable to service their debt , to leave . 
But , as a result of no-recourse mortgages in many US states , the entire mortgage debt was then extinguished , even if the value of the home was too low to cover the balance still due . 
Moreover , even in those states where there is full recourse , so that the homeowner remains liable for the full amount of the mortgage loan ( that is , the difference between the balance due and the value recovered by selling the home ) , America &apos;s procedures for personal bankruptcy offer a relatively quick solution . 
Millions of Americans have filed for personal bankruptcy since 2008 , thereby extinguishing their personal debt . 
Of course , there has also been a surge of bankruptcies in the eurozone &apos;s periphery . 
But in countries like Italy , Spain , and Greece , the length of a bankruptcy proceeding is measured in years , not months or weeks , as in the US . 
Moreover , in most of continental Europe a person can be discharged of his or her debt only after a lengthy period , often 5-7 years , during which almost all income must be devoted to debt service . 
In the US , by contrast , the corresponding period lasts less than one year in most cases . 
Moreover , the terms of discharge tend to be much stricter in Europe . 
An extreme case is Spain , where mortgage debt is never extinguished , not even after a personal bankruptcy . 
This key difference between the US and ( continental ) Europe explains the resilience of the US economy to the collapse of its credit boom . 
The excessive debt accumulated by households has been worked off much more rapidly ; and , once losses have been recognized , people can start again . 
The cause of the transatlantic growth gap thus should not be sought in excessive eurozone austerity or the excessive prudence of the European Central Bank . 
There are structural reasons for the eurozone economy &apos;s slow recovery from the financial meltdown in its periphery . 
Most important , compared to the US , the excess debt created during the boom years has been much more difficult to work off . 
European officials are right to promote structural reforms of EU countries &quot; labor and product markets . 
But they should also focus on overhauling and accelerating bankruptcy procedures , so that losses can be recognized more quickly and over-indebted households can start afresh , rather than being shackled for years .
