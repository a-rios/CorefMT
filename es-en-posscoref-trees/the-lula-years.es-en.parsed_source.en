The Lula Years 
SAO PAULO - A recent article in a Brazilian newspaper described a day in the life of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as he campaigns in the October election that will choose his successor . 
Lula &apos;s day started before sunrise at the gates of an automobile plant in São Bernardo do Campo , part of Sao Paulo &apos;s industrial belt , where he rose to prominence as a union leader defying the military dictatorship 30 years ago . 
The purpose of Lula &apos;s visit was to support his personally appointed presidential candidate , Dilma Rousseff , who was formerly his chief of staff and the main architect of the government &apos;s investment program , designed in 2007 to accelerate growth . 
Later that day , Lula met with infrastructure industrialists in a luxury downtown hotel . 
He addressed them as &quot; fellows , &quot; just as he had done a few hours before with the autoworkers . 
Brazil &apos;s bosses are cheering as loudly as its trade unionists for Lula nowadays , which is no surprise given the huge sums being spent on infrastructure , owing to massive public spending , the lavish capital-expenditure program of Petrobras , Brazil &apos;s state oil company , and credits provided by state-owned banks to low-income housing . 
But Lula &apos;s popularity reflects his political skill as much as the success of his social and economic program . 
His government can claim to have reduced poverty from 35 % to 22 % of the population , and also to have maintained a trend towards lower inequality , with the Gini coefficient - a 0-1 scale of wealth concentration - declining from 0.583 in 2003 to 0.548 in 2008 . 
Poor people have had their incomes complemented with a monthly allowance under a conditional cash-transfer program called &quot; Bolsa Familia , &quot; which now reaches more than 12 million households . 
In the same vein , pensioners &quot; real incomes increased more than 30 % on average over the past eight years , reflecting aggressive minimum-wage increases . 
Brazil &apos;s economic success during the Lula years stems from the decision to maintain the previous government &apos;s macroeconomic policy framework , which meant resisting more radical views within Lula &apos;s Workers Party . 
Success grew partly from confidence-building in the first years , but also owes much to the favorable international environment up to 2008 . 
China , with its huge demand for Brazilian commodities , was a key factor here . 
Brazil &apos;s terms of trade are now 18 % higher than in 2002 . 
During Lula &apos;s tenure , growth accelerated relative to previous periods , and inflation was kept within its targets for most of the time , though it remains slightly higher than elsewhere . 
But this year &apos;s 7 % growth rate , which puts Brazil nearly on par with China and India , cannot be sustained , as it exceeds potential growth by a wide margin . 
Consumption is being spurred by record-low unemployment rates , below 7 % , and by credit growth , which has doubled , from 22 % to 45 % of GDP , between 2002 and 2010 . 
But , even if Brazil cannot keep growing as fast as China , it still looks likely to race ahead . 
Investment growth has resumed its pre-crisis record pace but , at 19 % of GDP , investment remains far too low to support higher sustained growth . 
Balance-of-payments disequilibria have been eliminated in the past decade , but threaten to resurface if demand continues to outpace output growth . 
In the short term , however , financing should not be a problem : foreign-exchange reserves have reached more than $ 250 billion ; foreign direct investment , which has fallen elsewhere , still looks promising . 
World monetary conditions seem to point to a protracted period of high liquidity and low international interest rates . 
In Brazil , the basic real interest rate hovers around 5-6 % per year , the lowest level since Brazil introduced the modern real in 1994 ( yet still among the highest in the world ) . 
Domestic savings , however , remain a major constraint . 
Fiscal austerity helped to reverse the rising trend in public debt , and then reduced it to more manageable levels ( debt nonetheless remains comparatively high ) . 
The tax burden has increased by ten percentage points of GDP in 15 years , to a level ( 35 % ) that puts Brazil at odds with countries with similar per capita income levels . 
Earmarking of taxes caused current expenditures ( especially on social-security benefits ) to increase along with revenues , reducing the scope for a higher public-sector contribution to domestic savings . 
A recent decline in primary surpluses has added to the problem . 
Over the longer term , population aging represents a major challenge for a social-security system that already spends , as a share of GDP , as much as developed countries , where the share of the population 65 and over is twice that of Brazil . 
Although public investment has been on the rise , the country &apos;s poor infrastructure remains a barrier to higher growth . 
Moreover , state intervention is on the rise , a trend marked by greater reliance on public banks , especially BNDES , to support investment at subsidized interest rates . 
Long-term productivity growth , however , depends on educational improvements , adequate provision of public goods and infrastructure , and a healthy business environment that stimulates entrepreneurship and innovation . 
That means , in part , reforming a tax system that is widely perceived to be a source of inefficiencies and distortions that penalize domestic production . 
In these areas , Lula &apos;s government has underperformed . 
But one day it might , if the new government does not reverse recent trends .
