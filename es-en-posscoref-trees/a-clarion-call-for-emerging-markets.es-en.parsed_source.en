A Clarion Call for Emerging Markets 
ITHACA - With 2012 underway , it is worth reflecting on how a decade of strong economic growth in emerging markets led to last year &apos;s resounding political transformations . 
From the dramatic events in the Middle East , to the groundswell of support for the anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare in India , leaders in emerging markets are getting a clear message from the streets that growth is not everything . 
They ignore this message at their peril . 
Emerging-market economies delivered solid growth during the 2000 &quot; s , and even survived the global financial crisis without a growth collapse . 
But the specter of rising corruption is compromising the legitimacy of their economic gains and eroding support for further reforms needed to sustain their growth momentum . 
Corruption takes many forms , but , in emerging markets , a combination of factors has turned it into a cancer that ultimately topples regimes . Relentless low-level corruption is a major irritant for poor people in many of these countries ; indeed , it limits their access to the social services and basic government functions that they often depend upon for their very survival . 
Another type of corruption involves siphoning enormous sums of money from large-scale projects . 
In India , for example , the government lost as much as $ 30-40 billion of much-needed revenue when coveted band spectrum was sold through a rigged auction . 
For ordinary people , large-scale corruption is less visible , because , while the sums involved are mind-boggling , the costs are not as directly felt as they are in the case of lower-level graft . 
In countries like China and India , rapid economic growth has lifted a huge number of people out of poverty . 
Rising income inequality is hardly limited to emerging markets , but their combination of open corruption and pervasive inequities creates a toxic brew that is undermining support for reforms that would strengthen and consolidate their economic gains . 
In many emerging markets , a lack of political freedom adds to the combustible mix . 
The combination of corruption , inequality , and political repression builds up enormous pressure , and there are no institutional channels through which to release it . 
But freer political regimes are not a panacea . 
In a democracy like India &apos;s , the politically well-connected benefit from skewed growth , thus increasing the resentment of those left behind . 
The opportunity to &quot; throw the rascals out &quot; in each election cycle helps to let off some steam , but it does not resolve the problems that are generating it . 
It is difficult to predict what triggers popular protest , but economic factors are key . 
For example , rising food prices tend to hurt the poor , especially the urban poor , who spend a large share of their income on food ; unlike agricultural workers , they receive none of the benefits of higher food prices . 
With swelling urban populations , it will become increasingly difficult to keep a lid on these pressures . 
Some governments have reacted to recent events with political repression , information blackouts , or a combination of authoritarian measures . 
China , for example , blocked media coverage of the Egyptian protests . 
The Arab Spring , however , reveals the fragility of repressive political regimes that try to maintain their legitimacy by limiting information flows . 
The main lesson for dynamic emerging-market countries is that an exclusive focus on GDP growth may ultimately not be good for economic and political stability . 
Even with rapid increases in national income , if these countries &quot; leaders do not distribute the benefits fairly , they will become vulnerable to popular discontent . 
Tackling corruption is critical to improving long-term growth and maintaining social stability . 
These economies need measures that help to keep the poor out of poverty traps , and that give them realistic opportunities to improve their economic well-being . 
Such steps include broadening financial markets to give more people access to credit and investment , strengthening social safety nets to protect the economically vulnerable , and improving educational access and quality . 
These lessons apply equally to advanced economies , which also suffer from rising inequality and subtle forms of corruption . 
Emerging markets have a golden opportunity to build on their economic gains and lock in growth and stability by tackling deep-seated problems like corruption . 
As the past year &apos;s events have shown , the costs of inaction could be calamitous .
