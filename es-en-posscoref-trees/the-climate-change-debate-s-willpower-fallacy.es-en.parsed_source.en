The Climate Change Debate &apos;s Willpower Fallacy 
COPENHAGEN - There is a dangerous misperception that willpower and political agreement are the only missing ingredients needed to combat global warming . 
In fact , there is also a colossal technological hurdle . 
Ending our reliance on fossil fuels requires a complete transformation of the world &apos;s energy systems . 
No alternative form of energy is efficient enough to compete with fossil fuels at scale . 
Other than nuclear power - which is still much more expensive than fossil fuels - all of the known possibilities require significant research and development . 
Consider the frightening , absurd fact that the research relied on to advance the cause of carbon cuts uses economic models that simply assume that technological breakthroughs will happen by themselves . 
On our current complacent path , with a meager $ 2 billion of public funds spent annually worldwide on researching and developing green energy sources , the necessary breakthroughs will not happen in time . 
In that case , governments will try to cut carbon emissions through taxes and trading schemes without effective replacements . 
We will then make virtually no impact on climate change in the future , while in the shorter term there will be significant damage to economic growth , leaving more people in poverty and the planet in a much darker place than it could be . 
Keep in mind that global energy demand will double by 2050 . 
Use of fossil fuels - though much maligned by some - remains absolutely vital for economic development , prosperity , and our very survival . 
Alternative sources of energy have been hyped by corporate lobbyists and a credulous media to appear far more ready for widespread use than they really are . 
An oft-repeated claim is that Denmark - where politicians will meet in December to negotiate a successor to the Kyoto Protocol - receives one-fifth of its power from wind , making it by far the highest share in the world . 
Denmark is presented as a model for the rest of the world to follow , evidence that green job creation has been proven easy , and that wind power has been shown to be a cheap alternative . 
But the reality , revealed by a recent study by the Danish Center for Political Studies , is that less than 10 % of the Denmark &apos;s electricity demand is met by wind , because much of the power is produced when there is no demand and is sold at very low cost to other countries . 
This also means much less CO2 reductions in Denmark , where a ton of CO2 is reduced at more than six times the current average cost in the EU . 
The Danish wind industry is nearly completely dependent on taxpayer subsidies to support a modest workforce . 
Each new wind-power job costs the Danish taxpayer at least $ 119,000 ( â‚¬ 81,000 ) per year . 
The government subsidy has shifted employment to less productive employment in the wind industry , meaning that Danish GDP is approximately $ 270 million lower than it would be if the wind-sector workforce was employed elsewhere . 
The report concludes bluntly , &quot; No Danish wind industry to speak of would exist if it had to compete on market terms . &quot; 
Together , wind and solar energy supply a tiny fraction - less than 0.6 % - of the world &apos;s entire energy needs . 
This is not just because they are much more expensive , but also because there are massive technological hurdles to overcome to make them efficient . 
First , direct-current lines need to be constructed to carry solar and wind energy from the areas of highest sunshine and wind speeds to the areas where most people live . 
Second , storage needs to be invented so that when the sun doesn &apos;t shine , and the wind doesn &apos;t blow , the world still gets power . 
Indeed , according to Chris Green and Isabel Galiana of McGill University , even with these breakthroughs , the intermittency and variability in wind and solar energy means that they are unlikely to be able to supply much more than 10-15 % of grid-based electricity without massive investment in such storage systems . 
For this to occur , public funds on research and development must be increased dramatically . 
We cannot rely on private enterprise alone . 
As with medical research , early innovations will not reap significant financial rewards , so there is no strong incentive for private investment today . 
As the Copenhagen Consensus , as well as the World Bank recently advocated , R D investments on the order of $ 100 billion a year will be needed if wind and other alternative technologies are to become truly viable . 
Carbon taxes could play an important role in funding research and development . 
We are not on the right path to preventing the suffering that will result from global warming . 
What is required is not simply political will . 
A prosperous future requires abundant sources of energy . 
We face a daunting task to find credible alternatives to fossil fuel .
