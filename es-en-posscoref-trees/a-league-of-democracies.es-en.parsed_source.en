A League of Democracies ? 
LONDON - Senator John McCain , the Republican presidential candidate , has been calling for the creation of a &quot; League of Democracies . &quot; 
This new international group would possess a formidable military capacity , based partly on NATO and partly on a &quot; new quadrilateral security partnership &quot; in the Pacific between Australia , India , Japan , and the US . 
The League is necessary , argues McCain , because in matters vital to the US , such as fighting Islamic terrorism , humanitarian intervention , and spreading liberty , democracy , and free markets , the US and its democratic partners must be able to act without permission from the United Nations ( i.e. , from Russia and China ) . 
In other words , the League &apos;s main purpose is to marginalize Russia and China in world affairs . 
The most damning criticism of McCain &apos;s plan is that it would launch a new Cold War between states labeled democracies and autocracies . 
This is not only dangerous , but incoherent . 
Russia and China do not &quot; threaten &quot; the &quot; free world &quot; with a powerful ideology and massive armed forces , as they did during the Cold War . 
Moreover , the world &apos;s democracies are themselves divided on how to deal with Islamic terrorism or genocide in Darfur : it was France , after all , which led the opposition in the UN Security Council to the US invasion of Iraq . 
Moreover , on issues like terrorism , nuclear proliferation , and climate change , the US needs Russian and Chinese help . 
Stigmatizing Russia and China as pariahs will not get them on board . 
( China must learn to behave &quot; responsibly , &quot; McCain declares with breath-taking condescension . ) In fact , Russia has mostly cooperated with the US in the &quot; war against terrorism . &quot; 
Finally , the idea is impracticable . 
One cannot imagine India or Brazil wanting to be part of any such a combination . 
So we would all spare ourselves an awful lot of trouble if McCain &apos;s brainchild were buried as quickly as possible . 
Yet underlying this idea is a serious proposition , to which Britain &apos;s former prime minister , Tony Blair , often gave eloquent expression : democracies don &apos;t fight each other , so if the whole world were democratic , wars would stop . 
Presumably , McCain &apos;s League of Democracies is designed to bring Immanuel Kant &apos;s dream of perpetual peace closer to realization by putting pressure on non-democracies to change their ways , by force if necessary . 
Leave aside the fact that efforts to make democracy bloom have become bloodily unstuck in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Is it true that democracies never fight each other ? 
The affirmative answer seems to depend on two separate claims . 
The first is that democracies have , as a matter of historical record , never fought each other . 
This is true of a rather small group of rich countries ( India is a partial exception ) , mainly in western Europe and its overseas offshoots , since World War II . 
Moroever , they are &quot; our kind &quot; of democracy - constitutional democracies that contain all the features we take for granted in modern Western systems , not &quot; Islamic democracies &quot; like Iran . 
A reasonable generalization from this rather small sample would be that &quot; prosperous and constitutional democracies tend to live in peace with each other . &quot; 
The second claim is that these countries live in peace because they are democracies . 
But is it democracy that has brought them peace and prosperity , or is it peace and prosperity that have brought democracy ? 
Is it democracy that has kept Europe peaceful since 1945 , or is it the long period of peace since 1945 that has allowed democracy to become the European norm ? 
The world already has a peace-maintaining institution . 
The UN was created under rules designed to enable states of different political colors to live together . 
Members accept the obligation not to use force except in self-defense or unless it is authorized by the Security Council . 
The US is frustrated by not being able to get its way at the UN . 
By implicitly bypassing the UN , and dividing the world into two armed camps , the League of Democracies would increase the danger of war . 
The world also already has a prosperity-spreading mechanism . 
It is called trade . 
In 1994 , the World Trade Organization was created to liberalize trade under agreed rules . 
It is full of faults , which need to be corrected . 
By subjecting trade relations to embargoes , sanctions , and tests of democracy , environmental standards , and human rights , the League is likely to retard the growth of trade , and thus the chance for poor non-democracies to catch up . 
The only purpose of the League of Democracies seems to be to legitimize war-making by democracies - in order to spread democracy ! 
This is the thrust of McCain &apos;s message . 
As he put it , the US was built for a purpose - to serve &quot; eternal and universal principles . &quot; 
Its God-given task is to build an &quot; enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom , security , prosperity , and hope . &quot; 
Noble rhetoric ! 
But if that is the League &apos;s purpose - and I see no other - then it is a danger to peace . 
This is crazy and unhistorical . 
It is up to the chastened nations of Western Europe , which broadly share American values but have learned something about political patience , to rein in the American fantasy of re-making the world in its own image . 
I am all for spreading Western-style democracy , but not at the cost of making the world more warlike . 
Peaceful coexistence between different political systems is an attainable objective , and one to which all the world &apos;s major powers can sign up .
