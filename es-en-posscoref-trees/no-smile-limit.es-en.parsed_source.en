No Smile Limit 
If you were to walk along the streets of your neighborhood with your face up and an open expression , how many of those who passed you would smile , or greet you in some way ? 
Smiling is a universal human practice , although readiness to smile at strangers varies according to culture . 
In Australia , where being open and friendly to strangers is not unusual , the city of Port Phillip , an area covering some of the bayside suburbs of Melbourne , has been using volunteers to find out how often people smile at those who pass them in the street . 
It then put up signs that look like speed limits , but tell pedestrians that they are in , for example , a &quot; 10 Smiles Per Hour Zone . &quot; 
Frivolous nonsense ? 
A waste of taxpayers &quot; money ? 
Mayor Janet Bolitho says that putting up the signs is an attempt to encourage people to smile or say &quot; G &apos;day &quot; - the standard Australian greeting - to both neighbors and strangers as they stroll down the street . 
Smiling , she adds , encourages people to feel more connected with each other and safer , so it reduces fear of crime - an important element in the quality of life of many neighborhoods . 
In a related effort to get its residents to know each other , the city government also facilitates street parties . 
It leaves the details to the locals , but offers organizational advice , loans out barbecues and sun umbrellas , and covers the public liability insurance . 
Many people who have lived in the same street for many years meet each other for the first time at a street party . 
All of this is part of a larger program that attempts to measure changes in the city &apos;s quality of life , so that the city council can know whether it is taking the community in a desirable direction . 
The council wants Port Phillip to be a sustainable community , not merely in an environmental sense , but also in terms of social equity , economic viability , and cultural vitality . 
Port Phillip is serious about being a good global citizen . 
Instead of seeing private car ownership as a sign of prosperity , the city hails a declining number of cars - and rising use of public transport - as a sign of progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions while encouraging a healthier lifestyle in which people are more inclined to walk or ride a bike . 
The city is also seeking less energy-intensive designs for new buildings . 
Some local governments see their role as being to provide basic services like collecting the trash and maintaining the roads - and of course , collecting the taxes to pay for this . 
Others promote the area &apos;s economy , by encouraging industry to move to the area , thus increasing jobs and the local tax base . 
The Port Phillip city government takes a broader and longer-term view . 
It wants those who live in the community after the present generation has gone to have the same opportunities for a good quality of life as today &apos;s residents have . 
To protect that quality of life , it has to be able to measure all the varied aspects that contribute to it - and friendliness is one of them . 
For many governments , both national and local , preventing crime is a far higher priority than encouraging friendship and cooperation . 
But , as Professor Richard Layard of the London School of Economics has argued in his recent book Happiness : Lessons from a New Science , promoting friendship is often easy , cheap , and can have big payoffs in making people happier . 
So why shouldn &apos;t that be a focus of public policy ? 
Very small positive experiences can make people not only feel better about themselves , but also be more helpful to others . 
In the 1970 &quot; s , American psychologists Alice Isen and Paula Levin conducted an experiment in which some randomly selected people making a phone call found a ten-cent coin left behind by a previous caller , and others did not . 
All subjects were then given an opportunity to help a woman pick up a folder of papers she dropped in front of them . 
Isen and Levin claimed that of the 16 who found a coin , 14 helped the woman , while of the 25 who did not find a coin , only one helped her . 
A further study found a similar difference in willingness to mail an addressed letter that had been left behind in the phone booth : those who found the coin were more likely to mail the letter . 
Although later research has cast doubt on the existence of such dramatic differences , there is little doubt that being in a good mood makes people feel better about themselves and more likely to help others . 
Psychologists refer to it as the &quot; glow of goodwill . &quot; 
Why shouldn &apos;t taking small steps that may produce such a glow be part of the role of government ? 
Here is one measure of success : over the past year and a half , the proportion of people who smile at you in Port Phillip has risen , from 8 % to 10 % .
