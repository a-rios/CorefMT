Fanatics , Charlatans , and Economists 
DAVOS - Throughout the world , it seems , crisis is gripping national politics . 
In election after election , voter turnout has hit historic lows . 
Politicians are universally reviled . 
Mainstream parties , desperate to remain relevant , are caught in a vice , forced to choose between pandering to extremism and the risk of being overwhelmed by populist , anti-establishment movements . 
Meanwhile , not since the end of World War II has money played such an important role in politics , trumping the power of ideas . 
In the United States , for example , the sound of billions of dollars flowing into election-campaign coffers is drowning out the voices of individual voters . 
In parts of the world where the rule of law is weak , criminal networks and corruption displace democratic processes . 
In short , the pursuit of the collective good looks sadly quaint . 
The trouble began at the end of the Cold War , when the collapse of a bankrupt communist ideology was complacently interpreted as the triumph of the market . 
As communism was discarded , so was the concept of the state as an agent around which our collective interests and ambitions could be organized . 
The individual became the ultimate agent of change - an individual conceived as the type of rational actor that populates economists &quot; models . 
Such an individual &apos;s identity is not derived from class interests or other sociological characteristics , but from the logic of the market , which dictates maximization of self-interest , whether as a producer , a consumer , or a voter . 
Indeed , economics has been placed on a pedestal and enshrined in institutions like central banks and competition authorities , which have been intentionally separated and made independent from politics . 
As a result , governments have been confined to tinkering at the margins of markets &quot; allocation of resources . 
The 2008 global financial crisis , the resulting recession , and rapidly widening income and wealth inequality have punctured the glib triumphalism of economics . 
But politics , far from rising to take its place , continues to be discredited , as mainstream leaders - particularly in North America and Europe - call on economic theories to justify their policy choices . 
The pursuit of individual attainment is the hallmark of our time , eclipsing the collective dimension of human destiny . 
And yet the deep human need to be part of a group has yet to disappear . 
It lingers , but without a credible outlet . 
National projects ring hollow , and the so-called international community remains an abstraction . 
This unfulfilled desire for community may be felt particularly acutely by young people - including , for example , young jihadists . 
Indeed , nationalist politicians and religious leaders have been the first to spot the vacuum , and they are rapidly filling it . 
Pope Francis , Vladimir Putin , Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , and Marine Le Pen have little in common . 
The crisis of national politics has consequences that echo far beyond the borders of individual countries . 
National chauvinism and religious fundamentalism are here to stay , and with them the terrorism that extremists of all stripes embrace , because both phenomena are ideally suited to the age of the individual : They provide imaginary answers to personal angst , instead of political answers to collective challenges . 
These movements &quot; amorphous nature - often channeled through charismatic leaders - allows each individual to project onto them his or her dreams , making them difficult to counter within the framework of traditional politics . 
But this strength can also be a weakness . 
When tasked with managing territories and governing populations , these movements begin to face the same bothersome logistical and organizational constraints as their rivals . 
As a result , bureaucracy is constantly at their heels , leaving them in perpetual need of upheaval and renewal . 
If politics is to retake the field of values from the fanatics , the charlatans , and the economists , it must be rebuilt from the ground up . 
More than half of the world &apos;s population now lives in cities , and any political renaissance must counterbalance the appeal of vast virtual communities with resilient urban societies . 
Citizens must become reengaged with the political process , educated in public affairs , and provided with real ( not merely virtual ) platforms to air their differences and debate alternative views . 
Furthermore , institutions that provide bridges between states and the global community , such as the European Union , must be strengthened and refocused . 
In particular , their technical functions must be clearly distinguished from their political roles . 
But , above all , politicians must stop trying to shore up their diminished credibility with the pretense of economic science . 
Politics begins where contemporary economics ends - with ethics and the attempt to create a justly ordered society .
