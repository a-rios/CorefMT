Can Rouhani Deliver ? 
NEW YORK - As world powers meet in Geneva to begin nuclear talks with Iran , the world awaits the follow-up to the phone call between Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and US President Barack Obama after Rouhani &apos;s visit to the United Nations General Assembly last month . 
That brief conversation - the first between the two countries &quot; presidents since 1979 - recalls the last attempt to revive bilateral diplomacy , undertaken 12 years ago by Iran &apos;s then-President Mohammad Khatami . 
In both episodes , a missing handshake symbolized the countries &quot; persistent rift . 
Back then , Khatami and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi &quot; went shopping , &quot; rather than attend a cultural event at the Asia Society and risk crossing paths - and shaking hands - with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright . 
This time , despite Iran &apos;s avoidance of a presidential handshake at the UN , Rouhani delivered a major address at the Asia Society asserting that his government would pursue policies of &quot; moderation and common sense &quot; and would be willing to work with the West on resolving questions about its nuclear program . 
Moreover , handshakes were exchanged by the two countries &quot; foreign ministers , when John Kerry and Javad Zarif , joined by the European Union &apos;s top diplomat , Catherine Ashton , held a formal meeting to organize the upcoming nuclear negotiations in Geneva . 
Kerry and Zarif shook hands again when the two met separately . 
So what changed ? 
Back then , Iran &apos;s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , had forbidden Khatami to speak with the Americans . 
Rouhani , by contrast , proceeded with Khamenei &apos;s blessing . 
Khamenei , concerned with repairing the damage caused by his acceptance of the fraudulent reelection in 2009 of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was willing to accept the victory in June of Rouhani , a conservative reformist whom he trusted . 
He must have calculated that the new president would have to ameliorate the consequences of Ahmadinejad &apos;s foreign-policy freelancing and economic mismanagement , which has had as much to do with the collapse of the Iranian economy as US-led international sanctions . 
There had been earlier attempts to improve relations with the Americans . 
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who became Iran &apos;s president after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini &apos;s death in 1989 , sought such an outcome . 
In 1995 , he sent clear signals of a desire to restore diplomatic relations . 
Rafsanjani was in a much stronger position vis-Ã -vis Khamenei , who had just been selected to succeed Khomeini as Supreme Leader , than any of Iran &apos;s subsequent presidents . 
His trouble was with powerful opponents in Iran &apos;s security apparatus , who sabotaged his pragmatic foreign-policy initiatives by staging terrorist attacks in France , Germany , and Argentina . 
Khatami &apos;s proposal for a &quot; dialogue among civilizations &quot; in 2000 was an attempt to open a crack in what he described as the wall of mistrust that continued to separate Iran and the US . 
It was only in the last year of his second term that Clinton made a serious effort to respond to Khatami . 
But Khatami lacked the support of Khamenei , who firmly opposed his reforms . 
The aggressive rhetoric of Clinton &apos;s successor , George W. Bush , who called Iran part of an &quot; axis of evil &quot; prior to the US-led invasion of Iraq , made Khamenei apprehensive , and he endorsed an initiative for a dialogue with the Americans in 2003 . 
The Bush administration , in thrall to the idea of regime change , ignored this initiative and rejected the &quot; Big Deal &quot; on nuclear energy negotiated with the EU-3 in Paris in November 2004 by Rouhani , who was then Khamenei &apos;s representative and Chairman of Iran &apos;s National Security Council . 
The formal rejection of the Iran-EU nuclear agreement in February 2005 was an unintended gift to Iran &apos;s hardliners , led by Ahmadinejad . 
The return of hardliners after the ascendancy of moderates is a little-understood but fairly typical feature of twentieth-century revolutions . 
Ahmadinejad &apos;s election in 2005 was a throwback to the populism of Khomeini &apos;s Islamic Revolution and his cult of revolutionary martyrs . 
It went hand in hand with an aggressive foreign policy and a determined nuclear strategy of uranium enrichment that repeatedly frustrated EU negotiators and forced world leaders to fall into line behind America &apos;s crippling sanctions regime . 
There can be no doubt that before coming to the US , Iran &apos;s new president studied Obama &apos;s letter to Khamenei , who promised &quot; heroic flexibility &quot; in negotiations . 
With Khamenei &apos;s support , Rouhani will be able to rein in recalcitrant forces in Iran &apos;s power structure in a way that his pragmatic predecessors , Rafsanjani and Khatami , could not . 
More than any Iranian president since 1979 , Rouhani can deliver his part of the bargain - that is , if and when a bargain is struck .
