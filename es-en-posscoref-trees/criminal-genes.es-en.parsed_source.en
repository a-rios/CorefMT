Criminal Genes ? 
Can genes predispose a person to crime ? 
Some American lawyers are now using such a &quot; genetic defense &quot; as mitigation for convicted murderers . 
Are there genes for alcoholism ? 
Or genes that make you gay , religious , prone to divorce , or even genes that determine how you vote ? 
If you believe the claims of some of the scientists who call themselves &quot; behavior geneticists , &quot; many aspects of human behavior are in some way laid down by our genes . 
Claims of this type have a long , discredited history , stretching back through the eugenics movement of the early 20th century to its acknowledged &quot; father , &quot; Francis Galton , in Victorian England . 
But whatever the eugenics movement &apos;s extravagant claims and social crimes , including the forced sterilization of thousands ( mainly women ) in Europe and the US , today it is supposed to be different . 
Today , the claims are supposedly backed by advances in real molecular science , in genetics . 
Of course , many social problems run in families ; our societies are not egalitarian ; people living in poverty tend to rear children who live in poverty . 
This doesn &apos;t , however , make poverty genetic . 
Similarly the children of rich parents may inherit wealth , but this is social , not genetic inheritance . 
Sorting out the influence of genes and environment during the long , complex processes of human development is difficult - indeed , it is never possible to say of any individual , that x % of some aspect of their character is genetic , y % environmental . 
The two are indissolubly associated over the many years during which we construct ourselves out of the raw material of genes and environment . 
What geneticists do try to do is to find a measure of how much of the variation in some trait within a population may be attributed to genes , and whether any specific genes play a part in generating that trait . 
While it is possible to do this for diseases where the diagnosis is relatively unambiguous and there is only a single abnormal gene associated with the condition ( Huntington &apos;s disease is a good example ) , this is a far cry from saying that a specific gene causes you to be criminal or alcoholic . 
Genes certainly help shape our behavior , but that behavior is profoundly mediated by the processes of development , culture , social environment , and even technology . 
It is impossible to speak of genes that &quot; determine &quot; any complex aspect of human thought or action . 
Take &quot; aggression . &quot; 
We use the word to mean many different types of behaviour . 
We speak of aggressive businessmen , or aggressive surgery , in positive terms . 
But we also speak of men &apos;s aggressive behaviour to their partners or children , aggressive confrontations among football fans , or of police against protestors . 
We also speak of waging aggressive war . 
Are all these manifestations of the same &quot; condition ? &quot; 
Complicating matters , the same act involving the same genes , muscles and so forth , can sometimes be seen as criminally aggressive and sometimes as doing your duty . 
Take the case of the British soldier Lee Clegg who , while on duty in Northern Ireland , shot and killed a teenage joyrider whose car failed to stop at a security check . 
Clegg was tried , convicted , and imprisoned for murder but had his conviction quashed and was reinstated - and then promoted - in the army . 
So , did he have genes for criminal aggression , or is he a good soldier ? 
If this &quot; aggression phenotype &quot; is so poorly defined how can we hope to study its genetics ? 
Sadly , this hasn &apos;t stopped people from trying . 
This is illustrated by a research paper &quot; published in the journal Science in 1993 by a team led by Han Brunner describing a Dutch family some of whose men were reported as being abnormally violent . 
In particular , eight men &quot; living in different parts of the country at different times across three generations showed an &quot; abnormal behavioural phenotype . &quot; &quot; 
The types of behavior included &quot; aggressive outbursts , arson , attempted rape and exhibitionism . &quot; 
Can such widely differing types of behavior honestly be subsumed under the single heading of aggression ? 
Such an assertion , if made in the context of a study of non-human animal behaviour , would not be likely to pass scientific muster . 
Yet Brunner &apos;s paper was published in one of the world &apos;s most prestigious journals to considerable publicity . 
Much attention was devoted to its report that each of these &quot; violent &quot; individuals also carried a mutation in the gene coding for the enzyme monoamine oxidase &quot; ( MAOA ) . 
Could this mutation be the &quot; cause &quot; of the reported violence ? 
Brunner subsequently denied the direct link and dissociated himself from public claims that his group had identified a &quot; gene for aggression . &quot; 
Yet the paper is now widely cited , and what was described in its title as &quot; abnormal &quot; now becomes &quot; aggressive behaviour . &quot; 
Thus a paper describing mice lacking the monoamine oxidase A enzyme , appeared in Science under the title &quot; Aggressive Behaviour &quot; two years after the Brunner paper . 
The authors , primarily a French group headed by Olivier Cases , described mouse pups showing &quot; trembling , difficulty in righting , and fearfulness ... frantic running and falling over .. ( disturbed ) sleep ... propensity to bite the experimenter ... hunched posture ... &quot; 
Of all these features of disturbed development the authors chose only to highlight aggression in their paper &apos;s title , and to conclude their account by claiming that these results &quot; support the idea that the particularly aggressive behavior of the few known human males lacking MAOA ... is a more direct consequence of MAO deficiency . &quot; 
Such evidence &quot; slight though it is &quot; has become part of the arsenal employed by , for example , the US Federal Violence Initiative , which aims at identifying inner city children regarded as &quot; at risk &quot; of becoming violent as result of predisposing biochemical or genetic factors . 
This program , proposed originally by the then director of the US National Institute of Mental Health , Frederick Goodwin , originally ran into a hostility over its potentially racist overtones - ie , repeated coded references to &quot; high-impact inner city &quot; youth . 
Not long after , Goodwin left his directorship , and proposals to hold a meeting to discuss his proposals were abandoned several times . 
Nonetheless , aspects of the research program continue in Chicago and other cities . 
The example of &quot; aggression genes &quot; could be made over and over again in relationship to many of the other claims to explain the genetic roots of abnormal or undesirable human behavior . 
Such claims hit the headlines , and now influence social policy initiatives . 
Yet uncritical attempts to apply biological science to legislation about the human condition , if we are not careful , may lead us back into the dark days of eugenics .
