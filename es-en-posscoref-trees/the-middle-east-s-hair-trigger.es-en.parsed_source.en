The Middle East &apos;s Hair Trigger 
TEL AVIV - Across the Middle East , a fatalistic conventional wisdom is taking hold : war is unavoidable . 
Some see war as a way of resolving an increasingly deadlocked situation , shaking up a dysfunctional regional order whose main actors are not only at loggerheads , but are also incapable of resolving the legitimacy deficits of their respective regimes . 
A volley of incendiary remarks between Israel and both Syria and Hezbollah has fueled anxieties about the possibility of war on Israel &apos;s northern border . 
The level of sensitivity is such that the latest tension was initiated by the Syrians , who misinterpreted as a threat Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak &apos;s call to start peace negotiations precisely in order to prevent &quot; an all-out regional war . &quot; 
Hezbollah &apos;s leader , Hassan Nasrallah , for the first time explicitly warned the Israelis that a new round of conflict would no longer be confined to an Israeli-Lebanese showdown , but would involve the entire regional &quot; axis of confrontation &quot; - Syria , Iran , Hezbollah , and Hamas . 
This would also be the case if Israel unleashed its Air Force against Iran &apos;s nuclear installations . 
Moreover , Nasrallah made it clear that Israel &apos;s &quot; Dahyia Doctrine &quot; of total devastation of Lebanon in case of war would be answered in kind . 
The prospect of a Middle East conflagration has prompted an airlift of senior American officials to Israel to warn of the devastating consequences that an Israeli attack on Iran might have . 
Indeed , the Obama administration &apos;s main challenge these days is not peacemaking , but regional conflict management and preemption . 
CIA Director Leon Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen have already come and gone , with Vice President Joe Biden and a high-level delegation of the State Department and the National Security Council due in Jerusalem in early March . 
But preventing war will not be easy , because Barack Obama &apos;s mystique has worn off in the Arab world . 
The expectation that he would allow the Arabs , particularly the Syrians and the Palestinians , to recover their land without resorting to arms has been proved , by his own admission , to be unrealistic . 
Nor has he been able to rein in Iran &apos;s relentless drive for regional hegemony , or convince it to abandon its quest for nuclear arms . 
Israel will most likely listen to America &apos;s advice and consider a preemptive attack on Iran only after all diplomatic means have been exhausted , and after whatever sanctions are agreed upon fail to cut short Iran &apos;s march toward possessing the bomb . 
No matter how unjustified Israel &apos;s traditional military behavior seems in the eyes of its enemies and critics , it has always aspired to base its military actions on grounds that can be justified . 
This would seem to be particularly true when it comes to an attack on Iran &apos;s nuclear installations . 
Israel would not like to be seen as the spoiler of a diplomatic solution to a dispute that in any case cannot be resolved by military means alone . 
Wars in the Middle East , it should be recalled , have started even when the parties did not really want them . 
The 1967 war is one example . 
Today &apos;s anxieties , too , are fed by perceptions and fears , by real and imagined concerns . 
The Iranian challenge to Israel &apos;s strategic hegemony is presented as a Holocaust-style existential threat , and Israel &apos;s other enemies - Hezbollah , which believes that it can bring about &quot; the end of the Zionist entity , &quot; and Syria , which publicly boasts of its ballistic missiles &quot; capacity to destroy Israel &apos;s main urban centers - are similarly viewed as irrational actors . 
A covert war between Israel and Iran has been going on for some time now . 
The assassinations - allegedly by Israel - of Imad Mughniyah , Hezbollah &apos;s military chief and Iran &apos;s closest ally in the organization , two years ago , and more recently of Mahmoud al-Mahbouh , Hamas &apos;s liaison officer with the Al-Quds force of Iran &apos;s Revolutionary Guards , suggest that an unplanned chain of events could trigger a real war . 
The Lebanese front may ignite if Hezbollah seeks to avenge Mughniyah &apos;s death , or simply as a result of a knee-jerk reaction to a provocation , as in 2006 . 
If Iran and Syria then decide to back Hezbollah , a direct Israeli-Iranian showdown could follow . 
What Israel planned as a preemptive attack on Iran might then be presented as an act of self-defense . 
General James Jones , President Obama &apos;s national security adviser , recently put forward a different , albeit equally ominous , prediction . 
Iran &apos;s response to the mounting international pressure might be , he said , to launch an attack on Israel through its proxies , Hezbollah and Hamas . 
Such attacks might trigger a wider regional conflagration . 
War threats in the Middle East should never be dismissed as hollow . 
Prophecies of war , moreover , have too frequently proven themselves to be self-fulfilling . 
But America &apos;s extraordinary efforts to rein in Israel might not be enough to avert a calamity . 
The days of Pax Americana in the region are over , which means that avoiding a regional explosion will require mobilizing the major international actors that favor diplomatic solutions for the Arab-Israeli conflict and for Iran &apos;s quest to become a legitimate partner in a new regional system .
