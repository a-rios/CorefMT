My Outlook for 2009 
DAVOS - The future of the global economy will depend greatly on whether President Barack Obama launches a comprehensive and coherent set of measures , and on how successfully he carries them out . 
How the Chinese , Europeans , and other major players respond will be almost as important . 
If there is good international cooperation , the world economy may start climbing out of a deep hole by the end of 2009 . 
If not , we will face a much longer period of economic and political disorder and decline . 
There is no way to reestablish economic equilibrium in one fell swoop . 
Instead , the economy must first be pumped full of money to make up for the collapse of credit ; then , when credit begins to flow again , the liquidity must be drained from the system almost as fast as it was injected . 
This second operation will be both politically and technically more difficult than the first : it is much easier to give money away than to take it back . 
It is all the more important that stimulus packages be channeled into relatively productive investments . 
The bailout of the motor industry ought to be the exception , not the rule . 
The Dollar 
The effort to pump the American economy full of money will run into difficulties on two fronts : the exchange rate and interest rates . 
The dollar came under pressure early in the current financial crisis , but staged a strong recovery as the crisis worsened . 
The dollar &apos;s strength in the latter part of 2008 was due not to an increased desire to hold dollars but to increased difficulties in borrowing them . 
European and other international banks had acquired a lot of dollar-denominated assets which they habitually funded in the interbank market ; as the market dried up , they were forced to buy dollars . 
At the same time , periphery countries held a lot of dollar-denominated obligations which they had to repay when they could not roll them over . 
Russia and East European countries on the periphery of the euro were tied much more to the euro ; but when the Russian market collapsed , the effect on the dollar was the same , because the Russian central bank had overbought euros and had to sell them to defend the ruble . 
The trend was temporarily reversed at the end of 2008 when the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to practically zero and embarked on quantitative easing . 
The euro staged an explosive rally , but the rally was short lived because the eurozone developed its own internal difficulties . 
Widespread riots in Greece drew attention to the plight of the Southern Tier countries - Spain , Italy and Greece - and of Ireland . 
CDS rates for these countries rose , their credit ratings were lowered and the yield spreads on their government bonds versus Germany widened to an alarming extent . 
The euro headed lower right from the beginning of 2009 and it was even outpaced by sterling . 
Going forward the fact that Germany and the European Central Bank hold a different view of the problem confronting the global economy from the rest of the world is liable to cause wide swings in exchange rates and hinder the recovery . 
The ECB operates under asymmetric guidelines : it is constitutionally obliged to be concerned only with maintaining price stability , not full employment ; 
Germany still lives with the memory of the Weimar Republic &apos;s runaway inflation , which served as a prelude to the Nazi regime . 
Both considerations militate against fiscal irresponsibility and unlimited money creation . 
This should favor the euro as a store of value , but the internal tensions within Europe work in the opposite direction . 
The fact that there is no Europe-wide mechanism for protecting the banking system and each country has to act on its own raises doubts about their ability to do so . 
Is Ireland &apos;s credit good enough ? 
And can the ECB accept the government debt of Greece as collateral beyond certain limits ? 
The foundations of the Maastricht Treaty are shaking - not to mention the difficulties that the United Kingdom and Switzerland are facing in protecting their overgrown banks . 
As national regulators seek to protect their own banks , they may hurt the banking systems of other countries . 
For instance , Austrian and Italian banks are heavily exposed in Eastern Europe ; the Royal Bank of Scotland which is now majority owned by the British government does the bulk of its business abroad while a significant portion of UK housing is financed by foreign banks . 
Eventually the various national authorities will have to protect each other , but it is only a common danger that will force them to do so . 
The owners of wealth may increasingly turn to the yen and gold for safety but the may run into resistance from the authorities - sooner in the case of the yen than gold . 
And there will be a tug of war between those who seek safety and those who need to use their reserves to save their businesses . 
With all these contradictory forces at work we can expect wild currency fluctuations . 
Interest Rates 
The way out of a deflationary trap is to first induce inflation and then to reduce it . 
That is an intricate operation and success is far from assured . 
As soon as economic activity in the United States revives , interest rates on government bonds are liable to shoot up ; indeed , the yield curve is likely to steepen in anticipation . 
Either way , a rise in long-term interest rates is liable to choke off the recovery . 
The prospect of the greatly increased money supply turning into inflation is likely to lead to a period of stagflation . 
That , however , would be a high-class , desirable outcome because it would avoid prolonged depression . 
It is difficult , but not impossible , to imagine the U.S. economy growing at a rate of 3 percent or more in the decade ahead . 
The United States has been running a chronic current account deficit , which exceeded 6 percent of GDP at its peak . 
That will disappear , and it will leave behind a heavy burden of foreign debt that will be further swollen by the budget deficits of the next few years . 
Consumption as a share of GDP has to fall . 
The financial services sector , which has been the fastest growing segment of the economy , will shrink . 
With baby boomers retiring in increasing numbers , demographic trends have turned unfavorable . 
All these are negative influences . 
What is to be expected on the positive side ? 
More equitable income distribution , both domestically and internationally . 
Better social services , including education . 
A constructive energy policy leading to large-scale investments in alternative energy and energy saving . 
Reduced military expenditures . 
Faster growth in the developing world providing better export markets and investment opportunities . 
But even with the best policies , domestic growth is liable to lag behind the global economy . 
China 
What China does will have almost as much influence as President Obama on the future of the global economy , and Chinese-American relations will be the most important bilateral relationship in the world . 
China has a tremendous interest in the prosperity of the global economy . 
Obama can build on this in reconstructing the international financial system , but it will require great tact and foresight on both sides . 
The emergence of a new world power is a dangerous process . 
Twice it has led to world war in which the emergent power was defeated . 
China has to go out of its way to make itself acceptable if it wants to be accepted as a world leader . 
It has adapted the doctrine of harmonious development , which is the right approach , but it also has other doctrines , notably those relating to Taiwan and Tibet , that work in the opposite direction . 
Due to the erroneous policies of the Bush administration and the bursting of the super-bubble , China has gained too much power too soon . 
For a constructive partnership , both sides will have to lean over backward . 
President Obama has to treat China as an equal partner and China has to accept continuing American leadership . 
That will not be easy for either side . 
China has much to lose . 
It is not a democracy , and there is no established routine for changing governments . 
Failure to achieve a satisfactory growth rate - generally defined as 8 percent per annum - could lead to political turmoil , and political turmoil in China would be disastrous for the world . 
Fortunately , China has developed a method of elaborate consultations that , while not democratic , do give the various interest groups involved a voice in determining policy . 
The main drawback of the consensus-building process is that it is slow and cumbersome , and there is a danger is that the Chinese leadership will not move fast enough to counteract the sudden drop in the global economy . 
Here again , a strong lead from the new Obama administration could have a beneficial effect . 
The Indian Subcontinent 
India is more self-contained than China , and it should have less difficulty in maintaining its upside momentum . 
The Indian stock market has been harder hit than that of most countries , but its banking system , which is still largely in government hands , has been less affected . 
Remittances from the Gulf States will suffer and its outsourcing business will languish , but hopefully infrastructure investments , of which India has a great backlog , will continue apace . 
The macro-economic outlook is more favorable than for most of the world . 
The greatest uncertainties are political , and they revolve around Pakistan , which is a failing state . 
Some elements in the military and intelligence services have been closely involved with terrorists , and there is a real danger that they may gain the upper hand . 
The November 26 , 2008 , terrorist attacks on Mumbai were brilliantly planned , timed , and executed . 
Coming before the Indian elections , it was meant to set India and Pakistan against each other , allowing the Islamist influence in Pakistan at least to survive or at most to gain control of the State . 
The Bush administration allowed all the various players to be set against each other : Pakistan against India and Afghanistan ; the military against the civilian government within Pakistan ; 
Nawaz Sharif against Asif Ali Zardari , within the civilian government - not to mention the various tribes that have been armed by the military in order to fight the Pakistani Taliban fighting each other . 
The task of the Obama administration will be to bring the various factions together to fight the common enemy , the people behind the terrorist attacks on Mumbai . 
The problem of Pakistan is closely interlinked with the problem of Afghanistan . 
The American forces invading Afghanistan were originally welcomed as liberators , but NATO got involved without a proper plan of engagement , and after eight years the presence of foreign troops is no longer welcome . 
A New NATO plan ought to call for an orderly exit , but that is not possible while al Qaeda and the Taliban are gathering strength . 
Yet they cannot be defeated without the active support of the local population . 
Three obstacles stand in the way of success : the drug war that sets the local population against the occupying powers ; the existence of a safe haven in the tribal areas of Pakistan and ; the Karzai government &apos;s loss of legitimacy and popularity . 
The situation is not insoluble , but it will require extraordinary skill and perseverance to bring it under control .. 
The Oil-Producing Countries 
The oil-producing countries have suffered a sudden reversal of fortune . 
Their surpluses have turned into deficits , and their sovereign wealth funds and currency reserves have suffered major losses . 
The Gulf States have been badly hit , because their private sectors , including some banks , were greatly overextended . 
Dubai was the world &apos;s most spectacular real estate bubble and will have to be rescued by the deep pockets of Abu Dhabi . 
But the oil producers &quot; woes are not necessarily bad news . 
Some of the major oil-surplus countries , notably Iran , Venezuela , and Russia , have been enemies of the current world order , and their wings are being trimmed . 
The decline in Iran &apos;s capacity to sponsor political and terrorist movements in neighboring countries is already having beneficial effects . 
The political and security situation in Iraq seems to be stabilizing , and Syria seems to be more amenable to negotiation . 
The chances are good that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will not be re-elected in June 2009 . 
By contrast , Russia may become more of a menace due to the decline in oil prices . 
Under Vladimir Putin , nationalism has replaced communism as the country &apos;s guiding ideology . 
The Kremlin is now using its control over natural resources to reestablish Russia &apos;s position as a political power , enrich the rulers and ensure their own control over Russia , and to bribe and suborn the rulers of the former Soviet . The various objectives mutually reinforce each other ; together , they constitute the new order - a sham democracy built on petrol-patronage . 
In the Putin regime , economic power has been concentrated in the hands of two groups : those who acquired property and those who take a slice of cash flows . 
By and large , the first group is more sophisticated and more Western-oriented : it keeps its money and its children abroad . 
The second group exploits the state &apos;s arbitrary powers more directly . 
The first group was decimated by the financial crisis ; the second was left relatively unscathed . 
The crisis reinforced the arbitrary powers of the state , as a large part of official currency reserves was spent to bail out and reacquire the first group &apos;s assets . 
This is important , because , as the economic outlook deteriorates and the Putin regime will no longer be able to satisfy people &apos;s economic expectations , it is likely to rely more actively on arbitrary state powers . 
After all , the Kremlin is occupied not by the cautious bureaucrats of the Soviet era , but by buccaneers who were willing to take risks to get where they are . 
This may translate into military adventures abroad and repression at home . 
Europe 
Different European countries have reacted differently to the rise of a hostile Russia , influenced by their historical experience and their economic interests . 
Europe must resist the geopolitical challenge that Russia is posing , and it must be unified to have any chance of success . 
But a unified European policy must not be purely geopolitical , because Europe &apos;s common interest would not be strong enough to override national interests . 
Russia could divide and conquer , as it is doing already . 
The key to Europe &apos;s ability to neutralize Russia &apos;s geopolitical advantage is to establish a unified energy policy , with a Europe-wide distribution network and a Europe-wide regulatory authority that has precedence over national regulators . 
This would deprive Russia of its ability to play one country off against another , because a concession granted to one national distributor would immediately become available to customers in all the other countries . 
It no less necessary to continue promoting the rule of law , international cooperation , and the principles of open society , mainly by reforming the international financial system and by paying special attention to Russia &apos;s near-abroad . 
Ukraine , in particular , is in a perilous state , but financing public works that would create jobs in Eastern Ukraine , where the steel industry is in distress , could make a major difference both politically and economically . 
Georgia must be helped to recover from the damage inflicted by the Russian invasion , but help should be contingent on the Saakashvili government observing the principles of open society . 
Russia cannot be helped directly because of its excessive reliance on arbitrary state power , but when Russia sees progress in international cooperation , particularly with China , it will not want to be left out in the cold . 
The financial crisis and its aftermath will be a period of testing and , one hopes , development for the European Union &apos;s institutions , particularly its financial institutions , which are relatively new . 
The EU has a common currency and the ECB , but it does not have a common fiscal policy or treasury . 
This shortcoming has become increasingly evident and it may lead to a breakup of the eurozone . 
But belonging to the eurozone proved to be very valuable - Greece is hurting less than Denmark although its problems are much greater . 
Therefore the odds favor that the euro will emerge from the current crisis with the ECB given greater powers over the banking system . 
The Bush administration distinguished itself by driving a wedge between &quot; old Europe &quot; and &quot; new Europe . &quot; 
It is to be hoped that the Obama administration will adopt the opposite course . 
The world badly needs a more united Europe , both politically and financially . 
The Developing World 
A few countries like Brazil and Chile are reasonably well positioned to engage in countercyclical policies on their own with only a light assist from the IFIs . 
But most of the rest of the developing world is heavily dependent on the initiatives outlined in the previous chapter . 
In the absence of a radical international initiative , they face a very grim future . 
Countries like Pakistan , Egypt , Morocco , and Haiti have already experienced food riots . 
Others , such as South Africa and Turkey , suffer from serious power outages . 
Mexico has a serious security problem because of drug trafficking . 
As the economic situation deteriorates , the chances of civil unrest rise . 
The collapse of credit in the global financial system is having an even more devastating effect on the countries of the periphery than those at the center . 
Credit lines are withdrawn , maturing loans cannot be rolled over and trade finance has dried up . 
Hopefully , the leaders of the world recognize that it is in their own enlightened self-interest to come to the rescue of the developing world . 
The attraction of the SDR donation scheme is that it does not impose any direct costs on donor countries . 
All they have to do is vote for the creation of SDR and then pass on the benefits to less-developed countries . 
I hope they will rise to the occasion .
