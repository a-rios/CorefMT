The Real Lima Deal 
LIMA - It was the agreement that everyone wanted , yet that no one much likes . 
This year &apos;s annual United Nations climate-change conference in Lima , Peru , finally concluded in the early hours of Sunday morning , more than 24 hours after the scheduled close , after fierce argument in the final days . 
Negotiators from 196 countries patched together a compromise that keeps the world on course to a new global climate agreement in Paris next year ; but almost everyone was left unhappy with some provision or another . 
Many critics of the deal , however , have missed the point . 
The Lima deal is weak in many respects . 
The Lima conference had two goals . 
The first was to adopt an outline of the text of the 2015 Paris agreement . 
Delegates did not attempt to negotiate between the various options , taking to heart the old maxim &quot; Why do today what you can put off until tomorrow ? &quot; 
That negotiation has been left to the five sessions of talks scheduled for 2015 , starting in February . 
Given the divergence among the positions included in the Lima text , arriving at a draft fit for signing in Paris next December will be a huge task . 
The second goal was to agree on the terms under which countries will devise their national commitments - officially , their &quot; intended nationally determined contributions &quot; ( INDCs ) - in 2015 . 
Here , the compromises were sharply felt . 
Developing countries wanted the INDCs to include plans for adaptation to climate change as well as emissions cuts , and they wanted developed countries to include financial support for poorer countries . 
Instead , no commitments to new money were made , and the inclusion of adaptation plans will be optional , not compulsory . 
Meanwhile , developed countries wanted all countries to provide standardized information on their emissions targets and plans , to ensure transparency and comparability . 
The key elements were agreed on , but only in the form of guidance , not as requirements . 
Likewise , the proposal by the European Union and the United States that countries &quot; plans be subject to some kind of assessment was dropped from the final text . 
But the aggregate effect of all countries &quot; plans will be calculated , allowing evaluation next year of whether the world has done enough to limit average global warming to the agreed ceiling of 2ยบ Celsius . 
It almost certainly will have not . 
For many of the agreement &apos;s critics , particularly those in the environmental movement , these compromises made the Lima deal an excessively &quot; bottom-up &quot; agreement . 
Countries have too much latitude to make whatever commitments they want , relatively unconstrained by a common set of &quot; top-down &quot; rules imposed by the agreement . 
Such critics worry that this will make it harder to persuade countries to cut emissions further when it becomes clear that their collective efforts are not enough , and that it may even allow some countries to use irregular accounting methods . 
But this overlooks the Lima agreement &apos;s greatest accomplishment : It ends the longstanding division of the world into only two kinds of countries , developed and developing . 
Ever since the original UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed in 1992 , countries &quot; obligations have been defined according to their level of development in that year . 
The rich so-called &quot; Annex 1 &quot; countries have had compulsory obligations , while poorer &quot; non-Annex 1 &quot; countries merely have been required to make voluntary efforts . 
Over the last 22 years , that binary distinction has looked increasingly obsolete , as the larger developing countries , such as China and Brazil , have emerged as economic superpowers and major greenhouse-gas emitters . 
For this reason , the developed world has long wanted to replace the &quot; firewall &quot; between the two historic groupings with a form of differentiation that better reflects the contemporary world . 
No longer . 
The Lima agreement creates obligations for countries without regard for the distinction between Annex 1 and non-Annex 1 . 
Rather , it uses a new phrase drawn from the recent agreement between the US and China : countries &quot; responsibilities will be based on &quot; common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in light of different national circumstances . &quot; 
The firewall has been breached . 
In theory , the Lima agreement on INDCs does not determine the shape of the long-term Paris agreement . 
But the vast majority of developing countries - including China and Brazil - are happy with the new regime . 
So it is impossible to imagine the binary model being restored - and those countries that opposed the change know it , which is why the final two days in Lima were so fiercely fought . 
The Lima conference has shown just how hard the negotiations in Paris next year will be , despite recent optimism about global progress . 
Abandoning the rigid distinction between developed and developing countries paves the way toward an agreement that all countries , including the US and China , can sign .
