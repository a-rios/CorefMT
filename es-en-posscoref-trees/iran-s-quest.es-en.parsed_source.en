Iran &apos;s Quest 
A major shortcoming in today &apos;s world is the persistence of a zero-sum sense of geopolitics . 
The world expected something different in the post-Cold War era to promote peace and stability . 
Instead , after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , momentum swung toward a &quot; global war on terror &quot; that , in practice , became the rationale for maintaining a Cold War mentality and supporting strategies of preemptive war and regime change that have intensified insecurity , instability , and international terrorism . 
Consider my country , Iran , which has not invaded any country in the past 250 years . 
After decades of struggle against dictatorship and foreign domination , we secured our freedom and independence in 1979 by establishing a political system of our own choosing . 
But instead of establishing friendly relations with Iran based on this new reality , the United States has consistently sought to restore its domination , even providing massive diplomatic , financial , and military support to Saddam Hussein in his war against my country during the 1980 &quot; s . 
The current dispute over Iran &apos;s peaceful and legal nuclear program is part of this pattern , replete with unfounded accusations , double standards , and moral and legal inconsistency , all hidden behind the alleged threat of proliferation . 
But Iran &apos;s peaceful nuclear program originates from the late 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s . 
Iran &apos;s energy demand will exceed its supply , possibly reducing or even eliminating its oil export capacity in the near future . 
Thus , Iran urgently needs to produce 20,000 megawatts of nuclear power by 2020 . 
As long ago as 1973 , the US government itself saw that Iran would need nuclear power . 
Indeed , the US expected that Iran would be capable of generating 20,000 megawatts by 1994 . 
Despite the encouragement of Iran &apos;s civil nuclear program by the US , Britain , Germany , and France , they all ultimately reneged on their contractual commitments after our revolution in 1979 . 
Today , some of these governments are even questioning Iran &apos;s need for nuclear energy - a matter that was obvious to them 30 years ago . 
Iran does not need nuclear weapons to protect its regional interests , and such weapons have no place in Iran &apos;s security strategy . 
It seeks to win the confidence of its neighbors and has remained within the confines of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) . 
The latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency has verified that there has been no diversion of Iran &apos;s civil nuclear program to weapons development . 
Iran has even proposed regional and multinational participation in its uranium enrichment facilities - only to be met by resounding silence from the Western powers . 
Meanwhile , US policy toward nuclear non-proliferation and the NPT regime is a case in point of double standards and the lack of sensitivity to other countries &quot; security concerns . 
While the US seeks to use unilateral and unlawful pressure to preclude Iran &apos;s legitimate right to peaceful nuclear energy , it has assisted in developing Israel &apos;s nuclear capabilities . 
Indeed , the US has acted as a buffer to insulate Israel - whose prime minister has boasted about its nuclear weapons - from any international scrutiny , while ignoring calls by Iran and other countries to create a Middle East nuclear-free zone . 
With regard to international terrorism , Iran , as a victim of terrorism , condemns it in all its forms . 
But the same double standards are apparent here . 
The US has used and is still using extremist organizations to promote its foreign policy goals . 
This could be said of US conduct with regard to al-Qaeda &apos;s precursors in Afghanistan in the 1980 &quot; s , and of its current dealings with terrorist groups such as the People &apos;s Mujahadeen Organization ( MKO ) , and the Kurdish PEJAK and PKK . 
The MKO , which was once on Saddam Hussein &apos;s payroll and responsible for the loss of many innocent lives in Iran and Iraq , is now under the protection of the US government in Iraq and operates freely in the US itself . 
Iran has always considered regional stability to be in the vital interest of its own security and development . 
Our efforts to establish a regional security and cooperation arrangement in the Persian Gulf date back to 1986 , at the height of the war with Iraq . 
We have continued to pursue these initiatives in the post-Saddam era , engaging in confidence-building measures with our immediate neighbors in order to offset extra-regional agitations . 
Iran currently applies the same policy considerations to Iraq and Afghanistan , despite its opposition to the US-led invasions of these countries . 
Iran has established excellent relations with post-Taliban Afghanistan and post-Saddam Iraq , and the most senior officials of both countries consistently reject US allegations of Iranian interference . 
These accusations are designed to portray Iran as a threat to regional stability and frighten other countries into creating an anti-Iran coalition , with the aim of diverting attention from the consequences of failed US policies not only in Iraq , but also in Lebanon and with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
The world deserves better . 
A just global order must be defined in terms of peace and security , alleviation of poverty , a fairer distribution of wealth , better protection of the environment , and respect for local cultural particularities . 
We can build a global order based on justice , one that negates the current unipolar order by developing tolerance for diversity instead of seeking imposition and assimi lation . 
Such an order will be culturally inclusive and less hegemonic , encompassing states , non-state actors , and social groups to minimize violence and maximize economic well-being . 
Erich Fromm , the late German psychologist and philosopher , once said that &quot; history is a graveyard of cultures that came to their catastrophic ends because of their incapacity for planned and rational voluntary reaction to challenges . &quot; 
We cannot predict our fate , but we can be certain that security will only come through real solidarity and global partnership .
