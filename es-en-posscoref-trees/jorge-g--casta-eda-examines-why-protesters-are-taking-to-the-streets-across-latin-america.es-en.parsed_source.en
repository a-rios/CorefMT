World Cup Blues 
MEXICO CITY - The conventional wisdom in Latin America is that the combination of economic growth , representative democracy , and middle-class expansion has led the region into a trap , with citizens &quot; expectations rising faster than governments &quot; ability to fulfill them . 
The frustrated middle classes , together with traditional sectors , stage demonstrations and riots , and vote out unresponsive governments . 
But few expected this tide of frustration to threaten Latin America &apos;s most competent president , Colombia &apos;s Juan Manuel Santos , or one of its most revered traditions , Brazilian soccer . 
Santos has governed Colombia boldly and effectively for four years . 
He not only ratified a free-trade agreement with the United States and addressed previous governments &quot; human-rights violations ; he also stuck to his guns on important reforms , despite large-scale protests by students , teachers , peasants , and business owners last year . 
While the economy has not grown fast enough to meet the country &apos;s needs , it has performed better than many others in the region . 
Most important , Santos staked his political capital on negotiating peace and disarmament with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) - the powerful guerrilla group ( often characterized as a &quot; narco-guerrilla &quot; movement ) that has been wreaking havoc on the country for four decades . 
While some progress had been made since peace talks began in Cuba three years ago , the negotiations were moving along slowly , giving opponents like Álvaro Uribe , Santos &apos;s predecessor , ample time to mobilize public opinion against the talks . 
Taking advantage of widespread opposition to amnesty for FARC leaders - a concession that would be an essential component of any deal - Santos &apos;s rivals transformed the first round of the election into a referendum on the negotiations . 
Santos lost by nearly five percentage points . 
Colombians were in a funk , and they took it out on Santos . 
He recovered by the second round , but won by a much smaller margin than anyone expected six months ago . 
Brazilians are in a funk , too , and they are directing their ire against the ruling Workers &quot; Party , with the ongoing World Cup soccer tournament and plans for the 2016 Olympics serving as prominent symbols of its leadership . 
Following the kickoff of the World Cup earlier this month , President Dilma Rousseff , who will run for re-election in October , began to slide in the polls . 
The Workers &quot; Party presidents - first Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , then Rousseff - believed that holding the world &apos;s two most important sporting events within a two-year period would mark Brazil &apos;s emergence as a rising world power , serving as a kind of &quot; coming out party . &quot; 
And their logic was sound , if a little arrogant ; only two other countries - Mexico and Germany - can count a back-to-back World Cup and Olympic Games among their achievements . 
But Brazil &apos;s rise was not as secure as its leaders seemed to believe . 
In 2011 , the economy stalled , and output has been stagnating ever since . 
The growth of the lower middle class - which had swelled by tens of millions of people in the preceding years - was halted , and consumer debt exploded . 
Even soaring commodity prices , bolstered by strong demand from China , became problematic , with the expectation of a terms-of-trade reversal generating significant uncertainty . 
Indeed , as GDP growth in China and India has slowed , so have these countries &quot; purchases of Brazilian primary goods . 
Brazilians &quot; belief that their country was headed toward long-term prosperity has been shattered - and they are taking it out on Rousseff . 
Last June , a small increase in public-transport fares in São Paulo sparked a wave of protests throughout the country , with citizens incensed over the shoddiness of public services provided by a government that records Latin America &apos;s highest tax take . 
Against this backdrop , demonstrators have also decried the government &apos;s decision to spend billions of dollars on World Cup infrastructure , including stadiums , hotels , and airports . 
A few years ago , a substantial majority of Brazilians supported holding the World Cup in their country . 
By last May , the share had declined to half - astoundingly low for some of the world &apos;s most enthusiastic soccer fans - with small but strident protests persisting across the country . 
Rousseff &apos;s opponents want the protests to disrupt the games , damaging Brazil &apos;s international image ; some are even hoping for Brazil &apos;s team to lose . 
Such an outcome would not be good for the country . 
Whatever frustration lower-middle-class Brazilians are feeling , a successful World Cup is their best option . 
Likewise , contrary to the perceptions of Uribe &apos;s supporters , Santos &apos;s reelection and continued pursuit of peace is exactly what Colombia needs right now . 
The more citizens understand and support this effort , the better its chances of success . 
All of this uncertainty says much about the state of affairs in Brazil and Colombia - and , indeed , in much of Latin America . 
Slow growth and high expectations have left the region in a deepening funk , and nobody seems quite sure how to escape it , leaving citizens and leaders alike to wait , watch , and hope .
