Why Russia &apos;s Economy Will Not Collapse 
GENEVA - The rapid depreciation of the ruble , despite a dramatic - and seemingly desperate - late-night interest-rate hike by the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) last month , has raised the specter of Russia &apos;s economic meltdown in 1998 . 
Indeed , the West has sought to animate that specter in its ongoing confrontation with Russian President Vladimir Putin . 
Oil and gas account for more than 60 % of Russia &apos;s exports ; other primary commodities make up much of the rest . 
Given this , the recent sharp decline in world oil prices obviously represents a major shock - large enough , when combined with the effect of increasingly strict Western sanctions - to provoke a sizeable recession . 
To make matters worse , commodity prices are expected to remain low for some time . 
In that case , the income loss would become much more than a temporary setback . 
But Russia is no economic basket-case-in-waiting - at least not yet . 
The situation today is very different from that in 1998 , when Russia was running twin fiscal and current-account deficits . 
Russia needed to borrow , and it was borrowing heavily in foreign currency . 
Eventually , default became inevitable . 
By contrast , in recent years , Russia has enjoyed a sizeable budget surplus , and public debt is below 20 % of GDP . 
It is true that income from oil and gas , which represents the bulk of government revenues , has been halved when measured in dollars . 
Similarly , Russia &apos;s current-account balance has been mostly in surplus in recent years . 
Gross public and private external debt is below 40 % of GDP , and much of it is denominated in rubles . 
The sharp fall in export income is rapidly changing the situation , but Russia is starting from a comfortable position . 
To panic would be premature . 
The ruble &apos;s free fall has been driven mainly by capital outflows . 
Russia &apos;s famous oligarchs have already stashed most of their wealth abroad , but they retain significant savings at home . 
As the economic and political situation deteriorates , they are most likely pulling more money out . 
Small savers have every reason to switch into foreign currency as well . 
This has put the CBR in a challenging position . 
The ruble &apos;s depreciation is bound to fuel inflation , already around 11 % and far above the CBR &apos;s 5 % target . 
In that context , raising the interest rate sharply makes sense , and officials may be hoping that the hike will stem capital outflows - despite the risk that the decision , if interpreted as being aimed at defending the currency , could have the opposite effect . 
The trouble is that the higher interest rates are bound to deepen Russia &apos;s economic downturn , making the CBR an easy scapegoat . 
Never mind that the central bank is not responsible for Russia &apos;s troubles - the run on the ruble , the recession , and the flare-up of inflation - and that using interest rates to prevent capital outflows always fails . 
Embattled politicians can be counted on to point the finger . 
The threat to Putin is clear . 
He risks the fate of his predecessor , Boris Yeltsin , who presided during a period of unusually low oil prices . 
Until now , Putin has been lucky , coming to power just as oil prices started to rise . 
Most Russian citizens credit him with two decades of rising living standards , following decades of decline . 
Putin &apos;s decision not to implement the unpopular reforms that would have created a strong non-oil export sector may have been bad for the economy &apos;s long-term health , but it has allowed him to maintain widespread public support . 
His economic good fortune , combined with his readiness to stand up to the West , has created a misguided impression in Russia that the country is , once again , a world power . 
Many in the United States and Europe believe that ratcheting up economic pressure on Russia will help drive Putin out . 
This is an enormously dangerous gamble . 
As Russian living standards decline , Putin &apos;s only viable strategy to remain in power will be an aggressive international posture . 
Foreign military adventures , after all , are most appealing when the domestic front is on fire . 
But it does mean that the time has come for a diplomatic approach that does not depend on the prospect of Russia &apos;s economic collapse .
