A Western Strategy for a Declining Russia 
CAMBRIDGE - The Aspen Strategy Group , a non-partisan group of foreign-policy experts that former US National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and I co-chair , recently wrestled with the question of how to respond to Russia &apos;s actions in Ukraine . 
And now NATO is wrestling with the same question . 
While the West must resist Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s challenge to the post-1945 norm of not claiming territory by force , it must not completely isolate Russia , a country with which the West has overlapping interests concerning nuclear security , non-proliferation , anti-terrorism , the Arctic , and regional issues like Iran and Afghanistan . 
Moreover , simple geography gives Putin the advantage in any escalation of the conflict in Ukraine . 
It is natural to feel angry at Putin &apos;s deceptions , but anger is not a strategy . 
The West needs to impose financial and energy sanctions to deter Russia in Ukraine ; but it also must not lose sight of the need to work with Russia on other issues . 
Reconciling these objectives is not easy , and neither side would gain from a new Cold War . 
Thus , it is not surprising that when it came to specific policy recommendations , the Aspen group was divided between &quot; squeezers &quot; and &quot; dealers . &quot; 
This dilemma should be put in long-term perspective : What type of Russia do we hope to see a decade from now ? 
Despite Putin &apos;s aggressive use of force and blustery propaganda , Russia is a country in decline . 
Putin &apos;s illiberal strategy of looking East while waging unconventional war on the West will turn Russia into China &apos;s gas station while cutting off its economy from the Western capital , technology , and contacts that it needs . 
Some of Russia &apos;s opponents might welcome the country &apos;s decline on the grounds that the problem will eventually solve itself . 
But that would be shortsighted . 
A century ago , the decline of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires proved highly disruptive to the international system . 
A gradual decline , like that of ancient Rome or eighteenth-century Spain , is less disruptive than a rapid one , but ultimately the best scenario would feature a recovering and rebalanced Russia over the next decade . 
The evidence of Russia &apos;s decline is pervasive . 
The rise in oil prices at the beginning of the century gave the economy an artificial boost , leading Goldman Sachs to include it among the world &apos;s major emerging markets ( one of the &quot; BRICs , &quot; along with Brazil , India , and China ) . 
Today , however , that growth has vanished . 
Russia &apos;s GDP is about one-seventh the size of America &apos;s , and its per capita income ( in purchasing-power-parity terms ) of $ 18,000 is roughly one-third that of the US . 
Oil and gas account for two-thirds of Russian exports , half of state revenues , and 20 % of GDP , whereas high-tech exports represent only 7 % of its manufactured exports ( compared to 28 % for the US ) . 
Resources are allocated inefficiently across the economy , with a corrupt institutional and legal structure that impedes private investment . 
Despite the attractiveness of traditional Russian culture and Putin &apos;s calls to boost Russian soft power , his bullying behavior has sown mistrust . 
Few foreigners watch Russian films , and no Russian university was ranked in the global top 100 last year . 
The likelihood of ethnic fragmentation is lower than in Soviet days , but it still remains a problem in the Caucasus . 
Non-Russians comprised half of the Soviet population ; they now make up 20 % of the Russian Federation and occupy 30 % of its territory . 
The public health system is in disarray . 
The birth rate is declining , mortality rates have increased , and the average Russian male dies in his early sixties . 
Mid-range estimates by United Nations demographers suggest that Russia &apos;s population may decline from 145 million today to 121 million by mid-century . 
But , though Russia at this point appears to be an industrial banana republic , many futures are still possible . 
It has talented human resources , and some sectors , like the defense industry , can produce sophisticated products . 
Some analysts believe that with reform and modernization , Russia would be able to surmount its problems . 
Former President Dmitri Medvedev , who worried that Russia would fall into the so-called middle-income trap rather than graduate to advanced-country status , laid out plans to do just that . 
Under Putin , Russia &apos;s post-imperial transformation has failed , and Russia remains pre-occupied with its place in the world and torn between its historical European and Slavophile identities . 
Putin lacks a strategy for Russia &apos;s long-term recovery and reacts opportunistically - albeit sometimes successfully in the short run - to domestic insecurity , perceived external threats , and the weakness of his neighbors . 
Russia has thus become a revisionist spoiler of the international status quo - one that seeks to be a catalyst for other revisionist powers . 
But an ideology of anti-liberalism and Russian nationalism is a poor source of the soft power that the country needs to increase its regional and global influence . 
Thus , the prospects that a Russian-led Eurasian Union can compete with the European Union are limited . 
Whatever the outcome of Putin &apos;s revisionism , Russia &apos;s nuclear weapons , oil and gas , skills in cyber technology , and proximity to Europe , will give him the resources to cause problems for the West and the international system . 
Designing and implementing a strategy that contains Putin &apos;s behavior while maintaining long-term engagement with Russia is one of the most important challenges facing the international community today .
