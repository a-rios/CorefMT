A Weaker Euro for a Stronger Europe 
CAMBRIDGE - Despite the recent upturn in some of its member countries , the eurozone &apos;s economy remains in the doldrums , with the overall rate of annual GDP growth this year likely to be only slightly higher than 1 % . 
Even Germany &apos;s growth rate is below 2 % , while GDP is still declining in France , Italy , and Spain . 
And this slow rate of growth has kept the eurozone &apos;s total unemployment rate at a painfully high 12 % . 
Slow growth and high unemployment are not the eurozone &apos;s only problems . 
The annual inflation rate , at just 0.5 % , is now so close to zero that even a minor shock could push it into negative territory and trigger a downward price spiral . 
Deflation would weaken aggregate demand by raising the real ( inflation-adjusted ) value of household and corporate debt , and by increasing real interest rates . 
Lower demand could , in turn , cause the fall in prices to accelerate , sending prices into a dangerous tailspin . 
There are few if any panaceas in economics . 
But a sharp decline in the euro &apos;s exchange rate - say , by 15 % - would remedy many of the eurozone &apos;s current economic problems . 
A weaker euro would raise the cost of imports and the potential prices of exports , thus pushing up the eurozone &apos;s overall inflation rate . 
Devaluation would also boost average eurozone GDP growth by stimulating exports and encouraging Europeans to substitute domestically produced goods and services for imported items . 
Although competitiveness within the eurozone would be unaffected , a weaker euro would significantly improve the external balance with the rest of the world , which accounts for about half of eurozone trade . 
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has emphasized his concern that the euro &apos;s rise over the past three years has increased the risk of deflation . 
But it was his famous declaration in July 2012 that the ECB would do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to preserve the euro that , while successful in reducing interest rates in the distressed countries of the eurozone periphery , also contributed to the euro &apos;s current strength . 
Today , neither Draghi &apos;s recent statements nor the prospect of an American-style program of large-scale asset purchases ( also known as quantitative easing ) has caused the euro to weaken or the inflation rate to move back toward the target level of 2 % . 
So the operative question is how to reduce the euro &apos;s relative value while maintaining the perception of stability that Draghi helped to establish in 2012 . 
Because quantitative easing by the ECB has been advocated as a way to weaken the euro , it is worthwhile to examine the impact of its use by the Federal Reserve on the value of the dollar and the inflation rate in the United States . 
The short answer is that it did very little to affect either . 
The real trade-weighted value of the dollar is now at the same level that it was in 2007 , before the onset of the Great Recession . 
It rose briefly during the peak crisis year of 2008 , as global investors sought the safe haven of dollar-denominated assets , but retreated during 2009 to its previous level . 
The dollar &apos;s value then remained relatively stable during more than three years of quantitative easing - and actually rose during 2013 , when the Fed &apos;s asset purchases reached a high of more than $ 1 trillion . 
Of course , other factors influenced the dollar &apos;s value during this period as well . 
Nonetheless , the behavior of the dollar &apos;s exchange rate during the period of quantitative easing offers no support for the proposed use of large-scale asset purchases by the ECB as a way to bring about euro depreciation . 
The Fed &apos;s quantitative easing also did not cause an increase in the rate of inflation . 
The consumer price index rose by 1.6 % in 2010 , when quantitative easing began , then increased somewhat faster in 2011 and 2012 , before dropping back to a gain of just 1.5 % in 2013 , the peak year for asset purchases . 
If the ECB wants to reduce the value of the euro and increase the eurozone &apos;s near-term inflation rate , the only reliable way to do so may be by direct intervention in the currency market - that is , selling euros and buying a basket of other currencies . 
While direct intervention to weaken the euro would create challenges in other parts of the world , policymakers in the US and elsewhere should recognize the importance of a more competitive euro to the future of the European economy .
