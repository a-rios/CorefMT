The Four &quot; Cs &quot; of Innovation 
PARIS - Innovation is now widely acknowledged to be a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth . 
Whether the changes are profoundly disruptive , or merely provide incremental improvements in products , services , or business models , the results boost an economy &apos;s long-run productivity . 
And innovation is necessary not only for developed economies , but also for emerging markets , which are receiving diminishing returns from simply transposing advanced economies &quot; best practices . 
But , while every country needs to innovate , the tried and tested approaches do not work for all markets . 
Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School has identified three broad forms of innovation that make firms - and ultimately economies - stronger . 
Firms can make incremental changes to existing products , thereby becoming more competitive in an existing market segment ; they can introduce products , like Sony &apos;s iconic Walkman or Apple &apos;s iPhone , that create new market segments ; or they can develop a product - such as electricity , the car , or an Internet search engine - that is so disruptive that it renders an entire sector or way of doing business almost obsolete . 
The challenge for governments is to devise ways to encourage firms or individuals to engage in more such innovation to bolster economic growth . 
Much of the research in this area , influenced by the work of Harvard &apos;s Michael Porter , has been dominated by &quot; cluster studies , &quot; which typically focus on improving productivity in emerging economies and regions within advanced economies . 
As a result , over the past two decades , policymakers &quot; attention has shifted from trying to understand Asia &apos;s so-called tiger economies toward recreating the successful clusters of Silicon Valley , Boston &apos;s Route 128 , Taiwan &apos;s Hsinchu Park , South Korea &apos;s Daedeok Science Town , and Israel &apos;s Silicon Wadi . 
Such clusters , however , often have attributes that cannot be replicated easily elsewhere . 
Silicon Valley &apos;s achievements are , arguably , a function of a unique cultural legacy rather than government policy ( though government has indirectly underpinned some of its most successful startups ) . 
Likewise , the early strategic government intervention - including planning , subsidies , and state ownership - that has underpinned innovation-led growth models in Israel , South Korea , and Taiwan is simply not available in many countries . 
Fortunately , there is a third approach , evident in the numerous innovation successes in Europe , Asia , the Middle East , and elsewhere that neither had state backing nor occurred within a uniquely creative business culture . 
Consider , for example , the Internet-based telecoms firm Skype , created in Estonia ; 
Navigon , another navigation system , and SoundCloud , a music download service , both made in Germany ; 
Maktoob , an Arabic Internet service provider , and Rubicon , a burgeoning animation educational company , both established in Jordan ; and Infosys and Wipro , two of many successful technology ventures in India . 
In studying these and other cases , the Innovation and Policy Initiative at INSEAD has identified four factors - the &quot; Four Cs &quot; - that support technological innovation and entrepreneurship : cost , convenience , caliber , and creative destruction . 
Success lies in the ability of firms to combine these factors either in a single country or across several markets . 
For example , Niklas Zennstr√∂m and Janus Friis left their native Sweden and Denmark , respectively , for low-cost , talent-rich Estonia to create Skype . 
Thus , the two Scandinavians &quot; creative-destructive thinking was combined with Estonia &apos;s low-cost , enterprise-friendly environment . 
The Swedish founders of SoundCloud , Alexander Ljung and Eric Wahlforss , decided that they were better off in relatively cheap Berlin , at the heart of Europe &apos;s underground music scene . 
Similarly , Samih Toukan and Hussam Khoury , who created Maktoob ( now owned by Yahoo ) , were able to combine the comparative advantage of Jordan &apos;s creative talent and low costs with the quality and convenience of Dubai &apos;s infrastructure and business networks . 
Sometimes , the overwhelming benefits of one or more factors are decisive . 
The caliber of Finland &apos;s infrastructure , workforce , and domestic networks overrode the concerns of Rovio &apos;s Finnish founders about their country &apos;s high costs and inconvenient location , so they decided to start their new business at home . 
But , increasingly , innovative startups operating in a mobile , globalized world will find that they can circumvent constraints in one location by shifting some or all of their assets or operations to another . 
The challenge for governments is to improve those less mobile factors of innovation - cost , caliber , and convenience - in order to attract , retain , and encourage free-flowing capital and the most creative citizens .
