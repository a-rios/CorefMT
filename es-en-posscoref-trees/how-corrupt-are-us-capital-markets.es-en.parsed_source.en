How Corrupt are US Capital Markets ? 
Why has the US stock market done so well in recent months - the Dow increased over 30 % since its low on March 11 , 2003 , and closed above 10,000 on December 11 - even with the media reporting one financial scandal after another ? 
We have seen Enron-style fraud from corporate management , Arthur Anderson-style smoke and mirrors from accountants , and now Putnam Funds-style market-timing irregularities from mutual funds . 
After all this dirt , why aren &apos;t more investors voting with their feet ? 
The most important reason is a sharp improvement in corporate earnings , and in economic conditions in general . 
The scandals may be pushing the boat of market sentiment downwards , but their effect is being overwhelmed by the rising tide of economic prosperity , at least for now . 
To be sure , television , radio , newspapers , magazines , and Internet sites have been hyping financial misconduct , awakening and shaping the type of emotional responses that often have a powerful influence on financial markets . 
But attention-getting emotions ( such as anger ) are not the only factors that drive investment decisions . 
Investors may respond emotionally , but they are unlikely to let their anger cause them to miss what appears to be a substantive increase in value . 
The excessive optimism of the late 1990 &apos;s lingers , so investors are more impressed by the recent upsurge in corporate earnings - seen as confirming their optimism - than they are by the financial scandals . 
Next to the $ 100 billion annual rise in after-tax corporate profits in the US in 2003 , the scandals look puny . 
Indeed , the scandals look even punier when one realizes that the list of crooked US companies , like Enron , is short . 
In 2002 , Harvey Pitt , the former chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission , made a dramatic call for CEOs of US companies with revenues exceeding $ 1.2 billion to sign their financial statements by August 14 , 2002 - and then be held criminally liable if the statements turn out to be fraudulent . 
The world anticipated a wave of &quot; restatements &quot; of past performance by anxious CEOs . 
Is accounting in worse shape ? 
The major accounting firms have clearly established a culture of permissiveness towards earnings manipulation . 
The 1990 &apos;s saw an unprecedented rise in the number of quarters in which earnings beat analysts &apos; estimates by a penny a share , suggesting that more irregularities could be discovered . 
But the fact that earnings beat estimates by a penny a share every quarter is itself only a sign of quarter-to-quarter manipulations of earnings , not of their wholesale fabrication . 
Finally , the market-timing practices of mutual funds that have been revealed to date simply don &apos;t amount to all that much in the broader scheme of things . 
Eric Zitzewitz of Stanford University estimates that market timing has cost US mutual fund investors about $ 5 billion a year - less than 0.1 % of the $ 7 trillion mutual fund assets . 
This amount , akin to a modest management fee , is simply not a dominating consideration for investors . 
Paradoxically , the scandals themselves have highlighted America &apos;s strong regulatory system . 
If anything , they are evidence not of widespread corruption , but of the vigilance of US regulatory authorities - which is precisely why the cases now in the news are the exception rather than the rule . 
This vigilance is also reflected in the prompt legislative response to recent financial scandals . 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has made it a lot more difficult to repeat the kinds of things that Enron and Arthur Anderson did . 
The US House of Representatives has passed a reform bill that would prevent mutual-fund market-timing abuses . 
Similarly , regulatory agencies are now better equipped to deal with financial irregularities . 
The SEC &apos;s fiscal 2004 budget set by the House spending bill is $ 811 million , roughly twice as much as it was before the scandals surfaced . 
This is higher than that of regulators in other major countries . 
Investors also see that the US regulatory system is stronger than the SEC alone . 
Revelations of malfeasance have also come from the governments of New York ( Attorney General Elliott Spitzer ) and Massachusetts ( Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin ) . 
These states have set a standard for action , and there are 48 more states that could do the same . 
So investors know that even if a Federal agency like the SEC overlooks or ignores serious regulatory problems , another regulator might step in . 
The best evidence for continuing confidence in the integrity of US securities markets comes from foreign investors , who would be among the first to flee if they feared rampant corporate fraud and inadequate regulation . 
Being removed from the US , they should be highly sensitive to any whiff of information that their money may not be safe there . 
But net foreign purchases of US stocks for the first ten months of 2003 are still positive ( although down about 90 % from the same period of 2000 , the bubble-peak year ) . 
In short , most investors - while not always the most rational species - do know a good thing when they see it . 
The market may not value US stocks perfectly , but it is not irrational to believe that the corporate scandals are not a major factor .
