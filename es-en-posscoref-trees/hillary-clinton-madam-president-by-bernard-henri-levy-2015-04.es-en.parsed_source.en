Three Encounters with Hillary 
PARIS - It is Boston , July 2004 . 
The setting is a downtown restaurant to which the editor Tina Brown has invited Hillary Clinton and a handful of notables , including Caroline Kennedy , filmmaker Michael Moore , and former Senator George McGovern . 
What is immediately striking is Clinton &apos;s youthful appearance , bright laugh , and blue eyes that appear a little too round when she gazes at us with curiosity . 
Sometimes her expression is briefly clouded by a streak of stifled pain , obstinate and not wholly contained . 
Five years earlier , she was the most humiliated wife in America , a woman whose private life was thrown open - fully and relentlessly - to public scrutiny . 
So she can talk national and international politics until she is blue in the face . 
She can sing the praises of John Kerry , whom her party has just nominated in an effort to deny George W. Bush a second term . 
Still , there persists an idea that I cannot push out of my head , and that I enter into the travel journal that I am writing for The Atlantic . 
The idea is this : to avenge her husband and to take revenge on him , to wash away the stain on the family and show what an unblemished Clinton administration might look like , this woman will sooner or later be a candidate for the presidency of the United States . 
This idea brings to mind Philip Roth &apos;s The Human Stain , published a year after the Senate acquitted her husband of perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges , with its searing portrait of how indelible even an undeserved blot on one &apos;s reputation can be . 
She will strive to enter the Oval Office - the theater of her inner , outer , and planetary misery - on her own terms . 
Fast forward to Paris in May 2011 . 
The senator from New York has become President Barack Obama &apos;s secretary of state . 
Her aura dominated the just-concluded G-8 summit hosted by France . 
It is ten in the evening , and I am waiting at the elevators in the lobby of the Hotel Westin with Mahmoud Jibril , one of the leaders of the Libyan insurrection . 
Jibril has made a special trip to plead on behalf of the civilians whom Colonel Muammar Qaddafi and his sons have promised to drown in rivers of blood . 
&quot; I thought you were in Libya ! &quot; she exclaims when she sees me . 
&quot; I &apos;ve just returned , &quot; I respond , gesturing toward Jibril . 
&quot; Really , hidden in a vegetable truck with him ? &quot; 
That triggers one of those great bursts of laughter that , as I noticed in Boston , raise her high cheekbones still higher . 
Then , suddenly serious , and accompanied by a man whom I notice for the first time and who turns out to be J. Christopher Stevens , the young US ambassador to Libya who will be murdered a little more than a year later , she leads Jibril to her suite for an interview . 
When , after nearly an hour , Jibril reemerges , he is convinced that the conversation went badly . 
He grumbles that Clinton hardly opened her mouth , which he interprets to mean that his plea was not well received . 
In fact , Clinton was deeply moved by Jibril &apos;s testimony , riveted by the horror of the regime &apos;s tanks grinding toward Benghazi at that very moment . 
In the hours that follow , she convinces Obama not to bow to his anti-interventionist secretary of defense , Robert Gates . 
She displays emotion and composure , I note . 
Her humanity and compassion are coupled with an acute sense of the iron discipline required for effective governance . 
These are the reflexes of an impeccable stateswoman . 
By February 2012 , the war in Libya is over , and I am wrapping up my documentary film about the conflict . 
I am in Washington , DC , in a wood-paneled conference room on the seventh floor of the Department of State &apos;s headquarters , to gather Clinton &apos;s recollections , as I had already done with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron . 
This is the moment for conclusions and perspective , the always-fascinating moment when the actors in the drama , who have sometimes operated in secret , turn up their last cards . 
Clinton lends herself graciously to the exercise . 
She evokes her interview with Jibril , a conversation at the White House or the Elys√©e Palace . 
She remembers everything and regrets nothing . 
She feels that , in acting as she did , she was faithful to her most cherished values and beliefs . 
What strikes me the most is that she sees , even then , the beginnings of the tribal conflicts and the coming contest among Islamists to outdo one another in fundamentalist purity . 
She worries about the early violations of human rights , particularly women &apos;s rights , which she fears will multiply . 
She has no illusions that history turns out the way reason tells you it should . 
Time is needed , she says , to build a state and construct a democracy - time and a mixture of pragmatism and faith , of patience and audacity , of respect for others and regard for oneself . 
Was this concern about &quot; nation building &quot; a warning ? 
Was it her ideological contribution to an administration that , though she did not know it at the time , would continue without her ? 
Was she laying down the broad strokes and ambition of her own presidency ? 
One thing is certain : Of my three encounters with Hillary Clinton , this third was the one where I found her the strongest and most passionate , thoroughly imbued with the meaning and pitch of the great American pastoral . 
If we meet again , I will not be surprised if I am addressing her as Madam President .
