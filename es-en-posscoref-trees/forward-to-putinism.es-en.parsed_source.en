Forward to Putinism 
MOSCOW-NIZHNY NOVGOROD-NOVOSIBIRSK : &quot; Forward to Communism ! &quot; 
That slogan defined , and cynically mocked , the do-nothing Brezhnev era of stagnation . 
Today , Russia is racked by a sense of déjà � vu for those times . 
Under Yeltsin , despite the chaos of flawed markets and an even more flawed democracy , there was a sense that things were moving forward . 
Now many Russians have no idea where they are moving forward or backward or , indeed , if they are moving at all . 
President Putin &apos;s restoration of the old Soviet national anthem was the first recent hint that Russians are marching back to the future . 
Although Putin did have the decency to change the words , he retained the Soviet spirit - &quot; great Russia united forever . &quot; 
Then the Federal Service Bureau , formerly the KGB , celebrated the anniversary of the founding of its foreign service branch - ie , the spies - a reverie attended by a certain former employee named Putin . 
This was followed by a shareholders meeting of the RAO UES ( United Energy Systems ) , Russia &apos;s electricity giant , now headed by the reformer turned oligarch , Anatoly Chubais . 
The meeting was meant as a sign of Russia &apos;s new business friendly climate , but the banner hanging over the hall - &quot; Long Live the 80th Anniversary of Vladimir Lenin &apos;s GOELRO Plan &quot; - mocked that intent . 
GOELRO &apos;s ( State Organization for the Reconstruction and Development of the Soviet People &apos;s Economy ) slogan was &quot; Socialism means Soviet rule plus electrification of the country . &quot; 
Chubais &apos;s plan is similar to the GOELRO one , but instead of national socialization , it calls for obligatory national marketization . 
If a region can &apos;t pay for its electricity , people will be cut off and left without heating . 
For most of this enormous country , with its 135 million people and 11 time zones , such signs of the past and the promised business future are regarded as skeptically as proclamations about record harvests under Brezhnev . 
All of these are seen as Kremlin games , hypothetical and hypocritical , bearing little relation to reality . 
Everyone , to some degree , has nostalgia for the past , some bleary idea of how the past can ( rather than cannot ) work in the future . 
But Russia &apos;s people , after 10 years of Yeltsin &apos;s anarchic freedoms , are too jaundiced to take any slogan seriously - whether from the Soviet past or from the management consultant &apos;s hymn book . 
Russians no longer care about slogans and symbols because paying bills and feeding their families doesn &apos;t leave time for indoctrination and ideology . 
Perhaps this is something the West should have realized about the Soviet economy all along . 
Propaganda and indoctrination are time consuming and inefficient . 
You can &apos;t produce if you are chanting slogans or spying on friends . 
At the end of a day digging coal , teaching children , or waiting tables , Russians now want reasonable services , a logical tax system , and regular paychecks . 
Whatever anthem , old or new or none at all , under which these things appear will be deemed suitable , and maybe even be sung . 
Of course , many hope that someone will explain to Chubais that national marketization works best when supported by functioning social institutions and a social safety net . 
Few have any real hopes of that . 
Recently I traveled in distant regions of Russia , where I grasped the enormous disconnect between the center ( Moscow ) and Russia &apos;s periphery , between rulers and ruled . 
That disconnect is nothing new ; there have always been Tsars and serfs , Politburo commissars and proletariat . 
That postcommunist Boris Yeltsin , however , although he sometimes declared allegiance to a hazy collective sense of Rossiyane ( citizens of Russia ) , deprived - or freed , it &apos;s a matter of opinion - Russians of all collective life ; both the real life of shared hardship and the imaginary half-life of communist solidarity . 
Today everyone deals with life and hardship individually ( a new word in our everyday vocabulary ) regardless of any Kremlin desire to make life uniform . 
Indeed , even Russian uniformity is different nowadays . 
In Novgorod I saw LukOil ( one of Russia &apos;s big private oil companies ) petrol stations . 
I saw them in Moscow too ; then in Novosibirsk . 
They are uniform : red and white , brightly lit , clean and businesslike . 
What makes a market economy a market economy , I thought , is the fact that you can always find a Texaco or a BP , Elf or Statoil petrol station , or a Seven Eleven store in Alaska , South Carolina or Tokyo . 
When LukOil stations look the same in central Moscow and remote Siberia , it means something new and , yes , revolutionary . 
For in this uniformity Russia has the hope of becoming a &quot; normal &quot; country , a place where the uniformity of slogans is replaced by uniform commercial services . 
Of course , highbrows everywhere object to this &quot; McDonaldization &quot; of life , arguing that commercial sameness is the death of culture and individuality . 
In Western Europe , Japan , and the United States , places where individuality lost its novelty long ago and where the managerial spirit and mass commerce flourish , this sameness may be something to debate . 
In Russia , however , a couple of thousand shining LukOil stations are not threats but are , instead , harbingers . 
They are a new type of individuality here , the individuality of the entrepreneur / survivor against the tyranny of the socialist crowd . 
To critics of this , I offer one more sign . 
On my way to Novosibirk airport at 5a.m. on a morning when the temperature read minus 48 Celsius ( minus 118 Fahrenheit ) I saw a brightly-lit wooden hut . 
Pizzeria Venezia proclaimed a sign with a carving of a gondola . 
Globalization and someone &apos;s vague idea - no , dream - of la dolce vita had reached the depths of Russia . 
If Putinism means that , perhaps Russia is moving forward after all .
