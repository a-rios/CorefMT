How to Keep a New Year &apos;s Resolution 
MELBOURNE - Did you make any New Year &apos;s resolutions ? 
Perhaps you resolved to get fit , to lose weight , to save more money , or to drink less alcohol . 
But are you keeping your resolution ? 
We are not yet far into 2010 , but studies show that fewer than half of those who make New Year &apos;s resolutions manage to keep them for as long as one month . 
What does this tell us about human nature , and our ability to live either prudently or ethically ? 
Part of the problem , of course , is that we make resolutions to do only things that we are not otherwise likely to do . 
Only an anorexic would resolve to eat ice cream at least once a week , and only a workaholic would resolve to spend more time in front of the television . So we use the occasion of the New Year to try to change behavior that may be the most difficult to change . 
Nevertheless , presumably we make resolutions because we have decided that it would be best to do whatever it is that we are resolving to do . 
But if we have already made that decision , why don &apos;t we just do it ? 
From Socrates onwards , that question has puzzled philosophers . 
In the Protagoras , one of Plato &apos;s dialogues , Socrates says that no one chooses what they know to be bad . 
Hence choosing what is bad is a kind of error : people will do it only if they think that it is good . 
If we can teach people what is best , Socrates and Plato seem to have thought , they will do it . 
Aristotle took a different view , one that fits better with our everyday experience of failing to do what we know to be best . 
Our reason may tell us what is best to do , he thought , but in a particular moment our reason may be overwhelmed by emotion or desire . 
Thus , the problem is not lack of knowledge , but the failure of our reason to master other , non-rational aspects of our nature . 
That view is supported by recent scientific work showing that much of our behavior is based on very rapid , instinctive , emotionally based responses . 
Although we are capable of deciding what to do on the basis of rational thought processes , such decisions often prove less powerful than our instinctive feelings in moving us to action . 
What does this have to do with keeping resolutions ? 
Richard Holton , a professor of philosophy at MIT and the author of Willing , Wanting , Waiting , points out that a resolution is an attempt to overcome the problem of maintaining an intention when we expect that , at some future time , we will face inclinations contrary to our intention . 
Right now , we want to lose weight and we are rationally convinced that this is more important than the pleasure we will get from that extra slice of cake . 
But we anticipate that , faced with cake tomorrow , our desire for that rich chocolate texture will distort our reasoning so that we might convince ourselves that putting on just a little more weight doesn &apos;t really matter all that much . 
To prevent that , we seek to shore up our current intention to lose weight . 
By making a solemn resolution and telling our family and close friends about it , we tilt the scales against succumbing to temptation . 
If we fail to keep our resolution , we will have to admit that we are less in control of our behavior than we had hoped , thus losing face in our own eyes and in the eyes of others about whom we care . 
This fits well with what psychologists have discovered about how we can improve the odds that we will keep our resolutions . 
Richard Wiseman , a professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire , has tracked 5,000 people who made New Year &apos;s resolutions . 
Only about one in ten managed to stick to what they had resolved . 
In his recently released book 59 Seconds , Wiseman sets out the things that you can do to make success more likely : 
· Tell your family and friends about your resolution , thus both gaining support and increasing the personal cost of failure ; · Regularly remind yourself of the benefits of achieving your goal ; 
Individually , each of these factors seems trivial . 
Collectively , they are ways of exerting our self-control not only now , but in the future as well . 
If we succeed , the behavior we judge to be better will become habitual - and thus no longer require a conscious act of will to keep acting in that way . 
These tools for keeping a New Year &apos;s resolution can help us to make progress , not only in losing weight or staying out of debt , but also in living more ethically . 
We may even find that that is the best resolution to make , for our own benefit and that of others .
