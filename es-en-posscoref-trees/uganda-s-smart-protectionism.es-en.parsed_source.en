Uganda &apos;s Smart Protectionism 
KAMPALA - On a balmy afternoon , I met Dr. Gilbert Bukenya at his home on the shores of Lake Victoria , where we talked about the future of farming in Uganda . 
Working smarter is no empty slogan ; it is the key to modernizing African agriculture . 
An advocate of food self-sufficiency for Uganda , Bukenya wants Ugandans to eat more homegrown rice , thereby boosting local farmers and rice millers while freeing hard cash for higher uses . 
Bukenya has long promoted a new strain of African rice that grows in uplands ( as opposed to wetland paddies ) and requires less water . 
Embracing the new rice is part of the working-smarter formula . 
Once rice output began to expand , Bukenya and other Ugandan politicians played another smart card : they lobbied successfully for a 75 % duty on foreign rice , which stimulated rice production further . 
Uganda &apos;s importers , seeing the shift , have invested in new mills in the country , expanding employment and creating competition for farmers &quot; output , improving prices . 
New mills , meanwhile , lowered the cost of bringing domestic rice to market , so that consumers now still pay about the same for rice as they always have . 
And Uganda is poised to start exporting rice within East Africa and beyond . 
Uganda &apos;s success in expanding rice production is especially interesting given that the people of sub-Saharan Africa spend nearly $ 2 billion a year on rice grown outside of Africa . 
The amount of spending on rice alone by Africans equals the combined national budgets of Ghana and Senegal . 
As more Africans move to cities , they acquire a taste for rice , which is easy to store and can be cooked quickly . 
But such spending on imported rice is a scandal , because , with the help of wise policies , African farmers could grow much more rice , perhaps enough to eliminate virtually all imports . 
Much of the rice grown in Pakistan , Vietnam , and especially America is stimulated by subsidies , and then dumped into African markets at low prices - sometimes below the cost of production . 
These rice exporters , including the US , also maintain stiff import duties , thereby protecting domestic farmers from global competition . 
African governments sharply reduced or eliminated duties on imported rice in the 1990 &quot; s , urged on by the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and influential free-market economists . 
The assumption was that rich countries would reciprocate by curtailing subsidies to their farmers . 
But they haven &apos;t . 
But rice duties are working in Uganda - and in Nigeria , where rice output is also soaring and the value of imported rice is declining - and policymakers rightly believe that they must be maintained . 
The big exporters , such as the US and Vietnam , continue to supply massive subsidies to their rice farmers . 
Without protection , African farmers would once again be harmed by imports . 
Indeed , African governments might wish to look selectively at other crops . 
They need to rely on a mix of economic tools , including farm protectionism , aimed at helping indigenous producers . 
Virtually every successful Asian economy was built on selective trade barriers - and in China and India , the world &apos;s two fastest growing economies , such barriers remain in place . 
Even Korea and Japan maintain massive duties on imported rice simply to protect the livelihoods of their own rice farmers . 
Uganda and other African countries need to be careful that protectionism doesn &apos;t become a cover for inefficiency or corruption . 
And selective protectionism is of course no panacea for Africa , even when such policies effectively aid local producers . 
But economic self-reliance is a worthy goal for most African countries , and Uganda &apos;s experience suggests the potential of an approach long denigrated by the international community . 
For too long , African governments have listened to the siren song of free trade - and have suffered from too much openness , not too little . 
With the US and the European Union unwilling to slash their farm subsidies , Uganda &apos;s rice experiment deserves wider attention , if only because it shows that Africans aren &apos;t merely passive victims of international economic forces . 
They are fighting back and , at least in the rice fields of Uganda , they are winning .
