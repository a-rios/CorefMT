America &apos;s Drone Dilemma 
PRINCETON - Last month , Faisal bin Ali Jaber traveled from his home in Yemen to Washington , DC , to ask why a United States drone had fired missiles at , and killed , his brother-in-law , a cleric who had spoken out against Al Qaeda . 
Also killed in the attack was Jaber &apos;s nephew , a policeman who had come to offer protection to his uncle . 
Congressional representatives and government officials met Jaber and expressed their condolences , but provided no explanations . 
Nor has the US admitted that it made a mistake . 
A week later , Gen. Joseph F. Dunford , Jr . , the US and NATO commander in Afghanistan , did apologize for a drone attack that killed a child and seriously wounded two women in Afghanistan &apos;s Helmand Province . 
The incident &apos;s timing was particularly unfortunate , as it coincided with efforts to reach an agreement to keep a residual deployment of US troops in Afghanistan beyond the planned 2014 departure of foreign combat forces . 
Afghan President Hamid Karzai had referred to civilian casualties caused by US forces as a reason for not signing the agreement . 
&quot; For years , &quot; Karzai said in a statement issued after the strike , &quot; our people are being killed and their houses are being destroyed under the pretext of the war on terror . &quot; 
The war on terror is real enough , and not just a pretext , but so are the civilian casualties that have been occurring for years . 
In 2006 , I wrote about a US missile attack on a house in Damadola , a Pakistani village near the Afghan border , in which 18 people were killed , including five children . 
Then-President George W. Bush did not apologize for the attack , nor did he reprimand those who ordered it . 
This was , I pointed out , difficult to reconcile with his assertion ( concerning the ethics of destroying human embryos to create stem cells ) that America &apos;s president has &quot; an important obligation to foster and encourage respect for life in America and throughout the world . &quot; 
Before Barack Obama became President , he argued that , because the US did not have enough troops on the ground in Afghanistan , it was &quot; air-raiding villages and killing civilians , which is causing enormous problems there . &quot; 
As Karzai &apos;s statement shows , the problems have not gone away . 
Nor have they been limited to Afghanistan . 
Civilian casualties caused by the US have been a major source of difficulties in US-Pakistan relations as well . 
In September , Ben Emmerson , the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism , reported that the US had caused at least 400 civilian deaths in Pakistan , with another 200 of those killed being &quot; probable noncombatants . &quot; 
( Apart from the problem of knowing who was killed , there is the separate question of how , in a war with no armies , one defines a combatant . 
Does cooking for militants warrant being killed ? ) 
Emmerson &apos;s report drew on figures supplied by Pakistan &apos;s foreign ministry , but it was promptly undercut by the country &apos;s defense ministry , which issued its own figures indicating that only 67 of the 2,227 people killed by drone attacks since 2008 were civilians . 
That low number surprised many observers . 
Last May , in a speech at the National Defense University , Obama defended America &apos;s use of drones . 
The US , he said , was attacked on September 11 , 2001 , so the war it is waging against Al Qaeda , the Taliban , and their associated forces is a just one . 
Referring to the key criteria set out in many discussions of traditional &quot; just war &quot; doctrine , he called it &quot; a war waged proportionally , in last resort , and in self-defense . &quot; 
That may be true of the war against Al Qaeda ; it is less obviously correct with regard to the Taliban . 
Obnoxious as their rule over Afghanistan was , the Taliban did not attack America , and Bush &apos;s war against it was not a war of last resort . 
Obama acknowledged that innocent people had been killed in US drone attacks , but defended the strikes on the grounds that by eliminating Al Qaeda operatives , they have disrupted terrorist plots and saved lives . 
He pointed out that the number of Muslims killed by Al Qaeda &apos;s terrorist attacks &quot; dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes . &quot; 
Doing nothing , Obama added , &quot; is not an option . &quot; 
Nor - and here he has reversed himself since 2007 - is &quot; putting boots on the ground &quot; likely to cause fewer civilian casualties than drone strikes . 
Doing so would only lead to the US being seen as an occupying army - a perception that would yield &quot; a torrent of unintended consequences . &quot; 
Obama did , however , promise a change of policy , indicating that before any strike was undertaken , he would require &quot; near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured - the highest standard we can set . &quot; 
Since that speech , the frequency of strikes in Yemen and Pakistan has declined , but civilian casualties have continued , albeit at a lower rate . 
The &quot; near-certainty &quot; standard appears not to have been met . 
As long as Al Qaeda continues to plan terrorist attacks , the US cannot reasonably be required to forego opportunities to kill its leaders and others carrying out these attacks . 
But Obama did promise greater transparency , which is essential to any sound debate over the rights and wrongs of drone attacks , and to democratic control over how the US is waging its war against terrorism . 
The administration &apos;s refusal to apologize to Jaber , or even to explain what went wrong , indicates that this promise has yet to be fulfilled .
