Beware of Smiling Bears 
WARSAW - Remember the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PCA ) , aimed at enshrining &quot; commonly-shared values &quot; between Russia and the European Community ? 
Signed in 1994 during the hopeful early days of Russia &apos;s first-ever democracy , the PCA was bolstered in 1999 by the creation of the European Union &apos;s Common Security Defense Policy ( CSDP ) . 
Both sides often refer to this desire to forge closer relations as a &quot; strategic partnership . &quot; 
In the wake of Russia &apos;s apparent departure from democratization during Vladimir Putin &apos;s presidency , and of the wars in Chechnya and Georgia , the EU has adopted increasingly cautious language , sounding less optimistic about the prospects of a real partnership . 
Thus , the European Security Strategy , adopted in 2004 , says only that , &quot; we should continue to work for closer relations with Russia , a major factor in our security and prosperity . 
Respect for common values will reinforce progress towards a strategic partnership . &quot; 
Russia &apos;s August 2008 invasion of Georgia produced a sterner variation : &quot; No strategic partnership is possible if the values of democracy , respect for human rights , and the rule of law are not fully shared and respected . &quot; 
Russians , meanwhile , are struggling to reconcile their disparate views on Europe . 
Some profess to be &quot; sick and tired of dealing with Brussels bureaucrats . &quot; 
As Konstantin Kosachev , chairman of the Russian Duma &apos;s foreign relations committee , put it , &quot; In Germany , Italy , France , we can achieve much more . &quot; 
Kosachev and others do not believe that the EU is committed to serious talks on &quot; hard &quot; security , a Russian imperative - and with good reason . 
How to deal with Russia on security issues - particularly on energy security - is one of the most divisive issues facing the EU . 
Despite their commitment to speak to Russia with one voice , various EU countries negotiate with Russia bilaterally whenever possible ( especially over lucrative business contracts ) , congregating under the EU umbrella only when necessary . 
That gives Russia great scope to play one country against another . 
Russia , meanwhile , harbors deep disappointment with the West for its actions after communism &apos;s collapse . 
During the Gorbachev era , it was assumed that the West would stick to the essence of its Cold War containment policies . 
Russians expected that , once their country was seen to be no longer confrontational and expansionist , it would be treated as a legitimate partner , not as a defeated enemy . 
It would retain its status alongside the United States &quot; on the world stage , its territorial integrity would be unquestioned , and it would be left to manage its domestic affairs without outside interference or criticism . 
Growing resentment toward the West has reinforced Russian leaders &quot; enduring penchant for the concepts of &quot; Great Powers &quot; and &quot; spheres of influence , &quot; and the belief that international relations is a zero-sum game , in which others &quot; gain is Russia &apos;s loss . 
Thus , they cannot accept that more robust multilateral institutions , confidence , cooperation , and interdependence could assure international security . 
On the contrary , Russia &apos;s loss of superpower status is completely unacceptable . 
Economic growth during the Putin years , combined with the defeat of Georgia - which was regarded in Russia as the beginning of a great political comeback - provided the confidence needed to embrace efforts to re-model the transatlantic security architecture . 
Medvedev &apos;s proposed transatlantic security treaty would enshrine the principle of avoiding external force to resolve national disputes , which would rule out international intervention in the conflicts affecting the northern Caucasus , including Chechnya . 
The status quo would be reinforced further by the principle that no country may increase its security to the detriment of another . 
Worse , the freedom to join military treaties , stipulated in the Helsinki Accords of 1975 and in other major international agreements like the Charter of Paris for a New Europe or the Charter for European Security , is ominously omitted . 
The expansion of military alliances , such as NATO , would be declared a threatening measure . 
Europe should react to this Russian proposal , first , by acknowledging that Russia has a critical role to play in transatlantic security , and that it should be treated not only with caution , but also with respect . 
At the same time , a range of institutions already deals with the issue : OSCE , the NATO-Russia Council , and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council , to name but a few . 
These existing institutions might need to be reinvigorated and fortified , but there is no need for more of them . 
Second , the principle of the indivisibility of European and US security , so fundamental during the Cold War , remains valid . 
Security initiatives should therefore first be discussed bilaterally within the NATO-EU framework ; only then should a common position be presented at the OSCE . 
Speaking to Russia with one voice is absolutely essential . 
Third , the idea implicit in Medvedev &apos;s plan - that Russia should have veto power over all security-related decisions of NATO or the EU - must be rejected . 
Given that Russia &apos;s own new military doctrine presents NATO as a potential threat , its leaders can logically claim that NATO enlargement undermines Russian security . 
Russia should nonetheless be consulted on all major security issues . 
NATO-Russia consultation during the drafting of the latest NATO Strategic Concept is a good example - an approach that Russia itself rejected before adopting its new military doctrine . 
Consultations on the Medvedev Plan should also include other former Soviet-bloc countries , such as Ukraine . 
The best way to proceed on the Medvedev Plan would be an OSCE declaration similar to the one adopted in Istanbul in 1999 - that is , a political resolution , not a legally binding treaty . 
According Russia more formal recognition as a great power might help EU and US efforts to engage its leaders in a serious security dialogue .
