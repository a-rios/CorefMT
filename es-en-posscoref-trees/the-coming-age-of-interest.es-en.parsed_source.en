The Coming Age of Interest 
One swallow does not make a summer , and one month of normal job growth , and rising prices in the United States does not mean that the Federal Reserve no longer fears economic malaise and deflation . 
But the time will come when world interest rates begin to rise , as central bankers prepare to resist the upward creep of inflation . 
Whenever that moment arrives - whether this fall , in 2005 or 2006 , or in 2007 - America and the global economy will face financial vulnerabilities that reflect the success of the past three years of monetary stimulation in stemming declines in production and moderating unemployment . 
Short-term interest rates are astonishingly low : only 2 % in the euro zone , just 1 % in the US , and zero in Japan . 
Expansionary monetary policy has been successful , but only by pushing interest rates to historic lows - and by convincing investors that borrowing costs will remain at their current levels for a long time . 
The main result of monetary stimulus has been to boost asset prices : anything that pays a yield , a dividend , or a rent becomes much more attractive - and hence much more valuable in money terms - when interest rates are very low and expected to stay very low . 
This explains the large gaps between current prices for real estate in the US , equities in New York , London , and Frankfurt , and long-term bonds everywhere and what one would conventionally think their fundamental values should be . 
So what will happen when central banks start raising interest rates ? 
In 1994 , rising short-term rates caused increases in long-term rates - and declines in long-term bond prices - that were at least double what standard models at the time were predicting . 
Moreover , interest rates in the world &apos;s peripheral , developing economies rose far more than rates in the advanced industrial core . 
Thus , the first danger to worry about for 2005 and beyond - when world interest rates will most likely rise - is another wave of emerging-market financial crises . 
For countries like Mexico , Brazil , Turkey , Argentina , Korea , Malaysia , and Thailand , the record of the 1990 &apos;s demonstrates that interest-rate spreads can widen and capital flows reverse remarkably rapidly , regardless of how favorably IMF officials and analyses by major banks view a country &apos;s policies . 
Emerging-market interest-rate spreads now are abnormally low . 
International money flows - aside from inflows into the US - are not yet at levels associated with &quot; irrational exuberance , &quot; but there is still time for that to happen before interest rates start to rise . 
This is an alarming prospect , because if there is one lesson from the 1990 &apos;s , it is that nobody should overestimate the stability of international financial flows . 
The second danger springs from high asset values within the advanced industrial core . 
The dominant mode of thought within the Federal Reserve - with which I agree - appears to be that the information-technology revolution is continuing , that the pace of growth of potential output in the US remains very fast , and that the output gap is thus relatively wide . 
This implies that interest rates may , in fact , need to stay low for a very considerable period . 
Moreover , confidence in the Federal Reserve is high , and the last remnants of the 1970 &apos;s inflation risk premium have been wrung out of interest rates . 
As a result , even after output levels return to their potential , interest rates will stay low by the standards of the 1980 &apos;s and the 1990 &apos;s . 
All of this is , of course , good news for those who own assets like long-term bonds , stocks , and real estate . 
Indeed , elevating long-term asset prices was precisely the point of lowering interest rates : making bondholders and especially real estate owners richer , after all , provides a fillip to spending . 
But the bad news is that even if interest rates are expected to remain low for a while , they will not stay this low indefinitely . 
The bottom line is that when interest rates rise , asset values will fall . 
It is during such periods - particularly when asset values fall swiftly and substantially - that we discover exactly how good our central bankers are at their main job : reducing financial volatility and promoting economic stability . 
It is also during such periods that we discover how many people who are holding long-term bonds , real estate , or stocks are doing so not because they think current prices are attractive relative to fundamentals , but because their prices have gone up over the past several years . 
This is a crucial question for policy makers , because those who bought long-term assets due to what seemed like perpetually rising prices are also those who will sell as soon as price trends seem to be reversing . 
In particular , the US trade deficit looms as a massive source of instability should long-term asset prices fall significantly . 
To be sure , the challenges facing the world &apos;s economic policy makers during the next several years will be different from those that they have faced since the collapse of the NASDAQ bubble . 
The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by collapsing output and the threat of deflation . 
But , as we learned in the 1990 &apos;s , this does not mean that the coming challenges will be easier to handle .
