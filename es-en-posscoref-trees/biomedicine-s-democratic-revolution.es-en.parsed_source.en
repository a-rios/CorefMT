Biomedicine &apos;s Democratic Revolution 
SEATTLE - Very soon , it will be economically feasible to sequence human genomes and collect massive amounts of different types of health data as standard medical practice . 
Already , there are remarkable examples of how these new genetic data are changing our thinking about disease and diagnosis . 
Consider the Beery twins , born in 1996 in San Diego , California . 
They suffered from chronic vomiting , seizures , and muscle weakness , sending them and their parents on an odyssey of medical examinations and tests . 
The first diagnosis was cerebral palsy . 
Then they received a diagnosis of dystonia , a rare neurological disorder . 
Frustrated , their parents had the twins &quot; genomes sequenced . 
The results revealed that the twins had been incompletely diagnosed . 
Their previously diagnosed dystonia was being caused by a genetic mutation that was interfering with the neurotransmitter serotonin . 
The twins &quot; doctors found that the dystonia could be fully treated with a readily available serotonin replacement . 
So why haven &apos;t success stories like that of the Beery twins , together with the Internet &apos;s power and increasingly affordable collection of molecular data , led to the construction of a knowledge network of disease ? 
Why aren &apos;t scientists and doctors turning in droves to data-intensive science in order to build better &quot; disease maps &quot; ? 
One possible answer is that there are still technical barriers that block the construction and use of such networks . 
With our ability to generate ever-rising oceans of molecular data - now approaching the zetabyte scale ( that &apos;s a one followed by 21 zeros ) - comes the challenge of storing and deciphering this information . 
Cultural barriers are the real stumbling block . 
As humans , we are highly evolved to adjust to our surroundings : we tend to adapt to a culture , well-conceived or not , and lose sight of its failings . 
The fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and , more recently , the Arab Spring are clear examples of this dynamic . 
Similarly , the example of the Beery twins shows us that an alternative to symptom-based medicine can be realized : the advent of genomics technology can change not just what is known , but , more importantly , how we think of ourselves . 
But , in order to build the disease networks of tomorrow , we will need to move beyond the current linear approaches to science and to how scientists work . 
We all like a good story that unfolds in a straightforward way , but the story of disease plays out across a poly-nodal information network , similar to what an air traffic controller might track in the skies above a major airport . 
Biomedical researchers &quot; &quot; lock and key &quot; and linear-pathway representations are incomplete , and should be supplemented with disease maps that can now be built using molecular data . 
We must also build the infrastructure and cultivate the relationships needed to share disease maps with basic researchers , practicing doctors , drug developers , and even the public at large . 
Patents , trademarks , and competition for resources ( people , money , and accolades ) seal off information and prevent molecular data from being analyzed and shared . 
Rewards in biomedical research go to &quot; solo workers , &quot; and do nothing to acknowledge the work that can be done only by multi-functional groups . 
Despite these imposing obstacles to progress , there are reasons to believe that a cultural shift is afoot : researchers from geographically distant labs are forming non-traditional &quot; federations &quot; to combine their data sets , work on them collaboratively , and post the results for other scientists to analyze . 
Crowd-sourced competitions like DREAM Challenges and FoldIt show that important scientific findings can emerge from outside of universities and pharmaceutical companies . 
And public-private partnerships between drug developers , basic researchers , and patient groups that share information pre-competitively ( that is , with no or limited patent filings ) are an increasingly popular way to translate scientific findings into potentially meaningful clinical benefits . 
But a few successful federations , competitions , and partnerships may not be enough to transform biomedical research . 
Disruptive change may be required , and here each of us can make a profound difference . 
Patient groups are already organized ; their members can report their symptoms online and self-enroll in clinical trials . 
We can already obtain portions of our own genetic information and use it to make informed medical decisions , join existing patient groups , or create new ones . 
We can provide our genetic samples to data-driven trials to learn about our likelihood to respond to particular therapies . 
We can even organize to self-fund future studies or join only those studies that give us the legal right to say how and where our data are used . 
In other words , patients can and should stop being the passive &quot; sick &quot; and actively engage to pressure clinicians , researchers , and drug developers to adapt or perish . 
Democratized medicine represents the fullest flowering of the biomedical information revolution . 
There are few worthier goals than a future in which citizen-patients are active participants in managing their own health .
