The Color of Putin 
Public consciousness always uses stereotypes . 
Such is the case regarding Russia nowadays . 
Liberal Western and domestic circles commonly characterize Vladimir Putin &apos;s government as increasingly authoritarian and ineffective . 
Inasmuch as illiberal - and especially personal - regimes are considered the least stable , the logical conclusion is that the &quot; color revolution &quot; scenario that we observed in Georgia , Ukraine , and Kyrgyzstan is likely to repeat itself in Russia . 
Of course , anything is possible in today &apos;s Russia . 
Consider , for example , that no one has ever developed a precise way to measure whether and to what extent a government is effective . 
If the criterion of effectiveness is the ability to achieve all of a society &apos;s goals , we will probably never find such a thing . 
The United States , with a government that can hardly be described as weak , bungled the war in Iraq and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . 
Compared to these failures , Vladimir Putin &apos;s achievements in Chechnya look like the height of success . 
Similarly , the European Union &apos;s leadership is criticized for its inability to secure economic growth rates of more than 1-2 % ; by this standard , any government of a country with 7 % growth - such as Putin &apos;s Russia - should be called super-effective . 
Indeed , today &apos;s administration is far more effective than Boris Yeltsin &apos;s government during the 1990 &quot; s . 
Back then , most of the country was not governed at all , half of the economy &apos;s productive capacity vanished , the Kremlin could not get a single reform law through the Communist Duma , and only lazy people were not talking about the country &apos;s disintegration . 
To be sure , contemporary Russia can hardly be called an exemplary democracy , and not all trends are encouraging . 
It is difficult today to imagine tanks firing on a legally elected parliament or privatization of state assets - as well as delegation of the actual running of the country - to the head of state &apos;s family and business cronies . 
Similarly , it was not Putin who enacted a constitution with an enormously powerful presidential government and a weak system of checks and balances , nor did he start the slaughter in Chechnya . 
The Yeltsin regime was not so much democratic as anarchic and oligarchic . 
Today there is less anarchy and less oligarchy . 
The situation in Russia is far from identical to that which prevailed in , say , Ukraine at the time of last year &apos;s &quot; orange &quot; revolution . &quot; 
We Russians have no Victor Yushchenko , who from the start was the undisputed leader of the right-wing opposition . 
Nor do we have a Leonid Kuchma , an ineffective , weak-willed president who was widely hated . 
With an approval rating that hovers around 70 % , no one can accuse Putin of being unpopular - or , for that matter , of a willingness to surrender to the opposition or to people in the street . 
In any case , it is not liberals who can get people into the streets in Russia ; it is the Communists and nationalists . 
Their red and brown revolution would certainly be colorful , but not exactly the sunny outcome liberals profess to desire . 
Liberals should face up to grim reality : Russia already had an &quot; orange &quot; revolution , in 1991 , and the results were not particularly impressive . 
In fact , perhaps Ukraine , too , is beginning to suffer its own form of revolutionary hangover . 
As Yushchenko &apos;s recent sacking of his entire government shows , color revolutions have yet to prove that they are competent and effective . 
Alexis de Toqueville claimed that unfulfilled hopes lie at the basis of every revolution , that every revolution is engendered by disillusion caused by exaggerated expectations . 
The high point of disillusion with Russia &apos;s top leaders passed in 1999 , when the level of trust in Yeltsin sunk to around 3 % . 
In reality , the main trouble with the current Putin government in the eyes of its Western critics is that their friends and like-minded thinkers are no longer in the loop . 
That can happen with anyone , but it is still no reason for revolution , which is always better wished on someone else than on yourself . 
Yet despite all this , I have no doubt that an attempt will be made to bring down Russia &apos;s government by means outside the voting booth when the next presidential election is due in 2008 .
