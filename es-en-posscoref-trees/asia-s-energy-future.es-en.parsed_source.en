Asia &apos;s Energy Future 
SINGAPORE - Asia &apos;s rise is unstoppable . 
What is stoppable is the steep rise in Asia &apos;s reliance on fossil fuels . 
Indeed , the decisions to be made by Asia on energy production and use will determine the fate of our planet &apos;s environment . 
It is natural for the world to be alarmed by Asia &apos;s growing appetite for energy . 
If China and India replicate American per capita consumption of fossil fuels , the resulting greenhouse-gas emissions will only accelerate global warming . 
But Asians will not accept Western moralizing on energy use . 
The West industrialized rapidly without worrying about climate change , contributing mightily to the stock of greenhouse gases that has led the world ever closer to the tipping point at which global warming can no longer be halted . 
If the West now wants to hold Asian countries responsible for restraining new sources of greenhouse-gas emissions , it must first hold itself accountable for its old stock and current emissions . 
This is why there is unanimous agreement in Asia , including China and India , that any just solution for climate change demands greater sacrifice from rich Western countries . 
The good news is that robust public policy , coupled with rapid advances in technology , could help humanity as a whole reduce its energy consumption . 
Consistent policy and superior technology explain why Japan uses one-tenth the energy that China uses to generate the same amount of economic output . 
Both China and India can learn a lot from Japan , and both governments , fortunately , are firmly committed to increasing their energy efficiency and use of green technology . 
Zhenhua Xie , Chinese President Hu Jintao &apos;s special representative on climate change , has stated categorically that China has no other choice than to pursue sustainable development . 
In 2007 , China founded its National Leading Group on Climate Change , headed by President Hu , and adopted its National Climate Change Program , the first by any developing country . 
China aims to lower its energy consumption per unit of GDP by 20 % relative to 2005 levels by 2010 . 
As for India , at the G-8 Summit in July 2009 , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said , &quot; Nothing could be farther from the truth than the notion that the developing countries were complacent or were not interested in addressing the consequences of climate change . &quot; 
Indeed , in 2008 India unveiled an ambitious National Action Plan on Climate Change , which includes eight national missions , including solar and enhanced energy efficiency missions . 
Asia is also at the forefront of innovative energy technology and policy efforts . 
The nonprofit company Grameen Shakti currently leads the world in the installation of solar panels for the rural poor . 
From 1996 to 2009 , Grameen Shakti installed 750,000 solar home systems in Bangladesh to provide emissions-free electricity to more than two million people . 
China doubled the efficiency of rural energy consumption between 1983 and 1998 by distributing safer and cleaner stoves to 185 million households . 
In Singapore , regulators are developing an innovative Electricity Vending System to give 1.2 million consumers real-time price signals so that they can learn to conserve electricity during peak periods . 
India , China , and a handful of other Asian countries are also witnessing remarkable growth in local alternative energy companies and the use of renewable energy . 
India ranks fifth in the world in total production of wind power and third in terms of wind power added in 2008 . 
Suzlon Energy , an Indian company started in 1995 with just 20 people , has become one of the world &apos;s leading wind power companies , with offices in 21 countries . 
Moreover , China is the world leader in total renewable energy capacity , small hydroelectric capacity , and the use of solar hot water heaters ; second for wind power added in 2008 ( ahead of Germany and Spain ) ; and third in total ethanol production . 
Suntech , a Chinese company founded in 2001 , is the third largest manufacturer of solar cells in the world . 
Japan and South Korea were third in the amount of grid-connected solar photovoltaic panels added in 2008 ; the Philippines was second for total geothermal power and third for total biomass power ; 
Indonesia was third for total geothermal power . 
Yet neither policy nor technological innovations in Asia will solve the world &apos;s climate change problem . 
Only a major global bargain between the West and the rest will suffice . 
In the eyes of most Asian policymakers , the proposed contribution by the West , especially America , towards solving the problem is woefully inadequate . 
The American public is simply not being asked to make any serious sacrifices . 
The G-8 &quot; s declaration that its members will reduce carbon emissions by 80 % in 2050 contains no upfront commitments . 
Today , Earth &apos;s atmosphere already contains 380 parts per million of CO2 . 
The &quot; tipping point &quot; could come when we reach 450 ppm . 
Developing countries , particularly those in Asia , will suffer the worst consequences of global warming : storm damage , rising sea levels , and massive refugee flows . 
The Maldives will likely disappear entirely . 
In these circumstances , Asians cannot afford to sit back and moralize . 
They must formulate and present realistic solutions , and negotiate forcefully and realistically before and during the Copenhagen conference in December 2009 in order to produce a global agreement that is based on an equitable sharing of the global commons . 
The biggest challenge Asians face is to use their intellectual and political leadership to save the world and themselves .
