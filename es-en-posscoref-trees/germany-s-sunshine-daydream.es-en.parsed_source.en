Germany &apos;s Sunshine Daydream 
COPENHAGEN - One of the world &apos;s biggest green-energy public-policy experiments is coming to a bitter end in Germany , with important lessons for policymakers elsewhere . 
Germany once prided itself on being the &quot; photovoltaic world champion , &quot; doling out generous subsidies - totaling more than $ 130 billion , according to research from Germany &apos;s Ruhr University - to citizens to invest in solar energy . 
What went wrong ? 
There is a fundamental problem with subsidizing inefficient green technology : it is affordable only if it is done in tiny , tokenistic amounts . 
Using the government &apos;s generous subsidies , Germans installed 7.5 gigawatts of photovoltaic ( PV ) capacity last year , more than double what the government had deemed &quot; acceptable . &quot; 
It is estimated that this increase alone will lead to a $ 260 hike in the average consumer &apos;s annual power bill . 
According to Der Spiegel , even members of Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s staff are now describing the policy as a massive money pit . 
Philipp RÃ¶sler , Germany &apos;s minister of economics and technology , has called the spiraling solar subsidies a &quot; threat to the economy . &quot; 
Germany &apos;s enthusiasm for solar power is understandable . 
We could satisfy all of the world &apos;s energy needs for an entire year if we could capture just one hour of the sun &apos;s energy . 
Even with the inefficiency of current PV technology , we could meet the entire globe &apos;s energy demand with solar panels by covering 250,000 square kilometers ( 155,342 square miles ) , about 2.6 % of the Sahara Desert . 
Unfortunately , Germany - like most of the world - is not as sunny as the Sahara . 
Solar power is at least four times more costly than energy produced by fossil fuels . 
It also has the distinct disadvantage of not working at night , when much electricity is consumed . 
In the words of the German Association of Physicists , &quot; solar energy cannot replace any additional power plants . &quot; 
On short , overcast winter days , Germany &apos;s 1.1 million solar-power systems can generate no electricity at all . 
The country is then forced to import considerable amounts of electricity from nuclear power plants in France and the Czech Republic . 
When the sun failed to shine last winter , one emergency back-up plan powered up an Austrian oil-fired plant to fill the supply gap . 
Indeed , despite the massive investment , solar power accounts for only about 0.3 % of Germany &apos;s total energy . 
This is one of the key reasons why Germans now pay the second-highest price for electricity in the developed world ( exceeded only by Denmark , which aims to be the &quot; world wind-energy champion &quot; ) . 
Germans pay three times more than their American counterparts . 
Moreover , this sizeable investment does remarkably little to counter global warming . 
Even with unrealistically generous assumptions , the unimpressive net effect is that solar power reduces Germany &apos;s CO2 emissions by roughly eight million metric tons - or about 1 % - for the next 20 years . 
When the effects are calculated in a standard climate model , the result is a reduction in average temperature of 0.00005oC ( one twenty-thousandth of a degree Celsius , or one ten-thousandth of a degree Fahrenheit ) . 
To put it another way : by the end of the century , Germany &apos;s $ 130 billion solar panel subsidies will have postponed temperature increases by 23 hours . 
Using solar , Germany is paying about $ 1,000 per ton of CO2 reduced . 
The current CO2 price in Europe is $ 8 . 
Germany could have cut 131 times as much CO2 for the same price . 
Instead , the Germans are wasting more than 99 cents of every euro that they plow into solar panels . 
It gets worse : because Germany is part of the European Union Emissions Trading System , the actual effect of extra solar panels in Germany leads to no CO2 reductions , because total emissions are already capped . 
Germany &apos;s solar panels have only made it cheaper for Portugal or Greece to use coal . 
Defenders of Germany &apos;s solar subsidies also claim that they have helped to create &quot; green jobs . &quot; 
But each job created by green-energy policies costs an average of $ 175,000 - considerably more than job creation elsewhere in the economy , such as infrastructure or health care . 
Germany &apos;s experiment with subsidizing inefficient solar technology has failed . 
What governments should do instead is to focus first on increasing research and development to make green-energy technology cheaper and more competitive . 
Production should be ramped up later . 
In the meantime , Germans have paid about $ 130 billion for a climate-change policy that has no impact on global warming . 
They have subsidized Chinese jobs and other European countries &quot; reliance on dirty energy sources . 
As even many German officials would probably attest , governments elsewhere cannot afford to repeat the same mistake .
