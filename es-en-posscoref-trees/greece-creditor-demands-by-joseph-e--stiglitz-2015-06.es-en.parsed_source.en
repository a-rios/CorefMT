Europe &apos;s Last Act ? 
NEW YORK - European Union leaders continue to play a game of brinkmanship with the Greek government . 
Greece has met its creditors &quot; demands far more than halfway . 
Yet Germany and Greece &apos;s other creditors continue to demand that the country sign on to a program that has proven to be a failure , and that few economists ever thought could , would , or should be implemented . 
The swing in Greece &apos;s fiscal position from a large primary deficit to a surplus was almost unprecedented , but the demand that the country achieve a primary surplus of 4.5 % of GDP was unconscionable . 
Unfortunately , at the time that the &quot; troika &quot; - the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund - first included this irresponsible demand in the international financial program for Greece , the country &apos;s authorities had no choice but to accede to it . 
The folly of continuing to pursue this program is particularly acute now , given the 25 % decline in GDP that Greece has endured since the beginning of the crisis . 
The troika badly misjudged the macroeconomic effects of the program that they imposed . 
According to their published forecasts , they believed that , by cutting wages and accepting other austerity measures , Greek exports would increase and the economy would quickly return to growth . 
They also believed that the first debt restructuring would lead to debt sustainability . 
The troika &apos;s forecasts have been wrong , and repeatedly so . 
And not by a little , but by an enormous amount . 
Greece &apos;s voters were right to demand a change in course , and their government is right to refuse to sign on to a deeply flawed program . 
Having said that , there is room for a deal : Greece has made clear its willingness to engage in continued reforms , and has welcomed Europe &apos;s help in implementing some of them . 
A dose of reality on the part of Greece &apos;s creditors - about what is achievable , and about the macroeconomic consequences of different fiscal and structural reforms - could provide the basis of an agreement that would be good not only for Greece , but for all of Europe . 
Some in Europe , especially in Germany , seem nonchalant about a Greek exit from the eurozone . 
The market has , they claim , already &quot; priced in &quot; such a rupture . 
Some even suggest that it would be good for the monetary union . 
I believe that such views significantly underestimate both the current and future risks involved . 
A similar degree of complacency was evident in the United States before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 . 
The fragility of America &apos;s banks had been known for a long time - at least since the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns the previous March . 
Yet , given the lack of transparency ( owing in part to weak regulation ) , both markets and policymakers did not fully appreciate the linkages among financial institutions . 
Indeed , the world &apos;s financial system is still feeling the aftershocks of the Lehman collapse . 
And banks remain non-transparent , and thus at risk . 
We still don &apos;t know the full extent of linkages among financial institutions , including those arising from non-transparent derivatives and credit default swaps . 
In Europe , we can already see some of the consequences of inadequate regulation and the flawed design of the eurozone itself . 
We know that the structure of the eurozone encourages divergence , not convergence : as capital and talented people leave crisis-hit economies , these countries become less able to repay their debts . 
As markets grasp that a vicious downward spiral is structurally embedded in the euro , the consequences for the next crisis become profound . 
And another crisis in inevitable : it is in the very nature of capitalism . 
ECB President Mario Draghi &apos;s confidence trick , in the form of his declaration in 2012 that the monetary authorities would do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to preserve the euro , has worked so far . 
But the knowledge that the euro is not a binding commitment among its members will make it far less likely to work the next time . 
Bond yields could spike , and no amount of reassurance by the ECB and Europe &apos;s leaders would suffice to bring them down from stratospheric levels , because the world now knows that they will not do &quot; whatever it takes . &quot; 
As the example of Greece has shown , they will do only what short-sighted electoral politics demands . 
The most important consequence , I fear , is the weakening of European solidarity . 
The euro was supposed to strengthen it . 
Instead , it has had the opposite effect . 
It is not in the interest of Europe - or the world - to have a country on Europe &apos;s periphery alienated from its neighbors , especially now , when geopolitical instability is already so evident . 
The neighboring Middle East is in turmoil ; the West is attempting to contain a newly aggressive Russia ; and China , already the world &apos;s largest source of savings , the largest trading country , and the largest overall economy ( in terms of purchasing power parity ) , is confronting the West with new economic and strategic realities . 
This is no time for European disunion . 
Europe &apos;s leaders viewed themselves as visionaries when they created the euro . 
They thought they were looking beyond the short-term demands that usually preoccupy political leaders . 
Unfortunately , their understanding of economics fell short of their ambition ; and the politics of the moment did not permit the creation of the institutional framework that might have enabled the euro to work as intended . 
Although the single currency was supposed to bring unprecedented prosperity , it is difficult to detect a significant positive effect for the eurozone as a whole in the period before the crisis . 
In the period since , the adverse effects have been enormous . 
The future of Europe and the euro now depends on whether the eurozone &apos;s political leaders can combine a modicum of economic understanding with a visionary sense of , and concern for , European solidarity . 
We are likely to begin finding out the answer to that existential question in the next few weeks .
