Refugees and Reform in Europe 
LAGUNA BEACH - There is a simple truth beneath the growing human tragedy of Europe &apos;s refugee crisis , and the European Union cannot address the massive influx of exhausted , desperate people in a manner compatible with its values unless governments and citizens acknowledge it . 
Simply put , the historic challenge confronting Europe also offers historic opportunities . 
The question is whether Europe &apos;s politicians - who have failed to deliver on far less complicated issues over which they had a lot more control - can seize the moment . 
The scale of the challenge is immense , with the flow of refugees extremely difficult to monitor and channel , let alone limit . 
Fleeing war and oppression , tens of thousands of people are risking life and limb to find refuge in Europe - a phenomenon that will continue as long as chaos persists in countries of origin , such as Syria , and countries facilitating transit , such as Iraq and Libya . 
In the meantime , Europe &apos;s transport networks are under stress , as are shelters , border crossings , and registration centers . 
Common asylum policies - including , for example , the basic rule that asylum-seekers should be registered at their point of entry into the EU - are not functioning or are being bypassed . 
And the cherished concept of effortless travel within the border-free Schengen Area is under threat . 
These problems are aggravated by coordination failures . 
Attitudes toward refugees vary widely across countries , with Germany taking a particularly enlightened approach that contrasts sharply with Hungary &apos;s notably heartless one . 
Some countries , such as the Czech Republic , have blocked deals to share the burden fairly among European Union members , including through mandatory quotas . 
Add to that the preferences of the refugees - who , after risking everything to get to Europe , have strong feelings about where they would like to settle - and the policy challenges are enormous , particularly in the short run . 
European politicians have yet to catch up with the reality on the ground , let alone get ahead of it . 
And their failure is exacerbating the risks to the EU &apos;s political cohesion that emerged over the Greek crisis . 
Politicians have a powerful incentive to get Europe &apos;s response to the refugee crisis right . 
Beyond the need to alleviate the human misery that fills television screens and front pages of newspapers lies the imperative not to miss the significant medium-term opportunities that migration provides . 
Although there are pockets of high unemployment in Europe today , the ratio of workers to elderly people will decline considerably in the longer term . 
And , already , labor-market flexibility has been undermined by structural inertia , including difficulties in retooling and retraining workers , particularly the long-term unemployed . 
As the German government and some corporate leaders , including the CEO of Daimler-Benz , have already recognized , an open-minded approach to refugee absorption and integration can help to mitigate some of Europe &apos;s protracted structural problems . 
After all , a significant proportion of the incoming refugee population is said to be educated , motivated , and committed to building a better future in their new homes . 
Capitalizing on this , European decision-makers can turn a severe short-term challenge into a powerful long-term advantage . 
An enlightened policy response to the refugee crisis could help Europe in other ways as well . 
Already , it is unlocking additional fiscal outlays in countries like Germany - which , despite having the means , did not previously have the will to spend - thereby helping to alleviate an aggregate-demand imbalance that , together with structural impediments to growth and excessive indebtedness in some countries , has held back the region &apos;s recovery . 
The current situation could also provide the catalyst needed to make decisive progress on the EU &apos;s incomplete political , institutional , and financial architecture . 
And it could compel Europe to overcome the political obstacles blocking solutions to longstanding problems , such as providing the cover needed for certain European creditors to grant deeper debt relief for Greece , whose already-massive fiscal and employment problems are being exacerbated by the influx of refugees . 
It can even drive Europe to modernize its governance framework , which allows a few small countries to derail decisions supported by the vast majority of EU members . 
Pessimists would immediately point out that Europe has struggled to come together even on far less complex and more controllable issues , such as the protracted economic and financial crisis in Greece . 
Yet history also suggests that shocks of the scale and scope of the current refugee crisis have the potential to spur remarkable policy responses . 
Europe has the opportunity to turn today &apos;s refugee crisis into a catalyst for renewal and progress . 
Let us hope that its politicians stop bickering and start working together to take advantage of this opening . 
If they fail , the momentum behind regional integration - which has brought peace , prosperity , and hope to hundreds of millions of people - will weaken considerably , to the detriment of all .
