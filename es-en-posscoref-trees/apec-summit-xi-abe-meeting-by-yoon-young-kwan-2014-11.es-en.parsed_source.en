The Asian Paradox 
SEOUL - Given that the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum account for some 54 % of global GDP and about 44 % of world trade , the agenda for this month &apos;s APEC summit should be drawing much global attention . 
Yet the only issue in which anyone seems interested is whether or not Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will meet on the sidelines , and , if they do , whether a substantive discussion to ease bilateral tensions will take place . 
Of course , this is not altogether unreasonable , given the two countries &quot; importance in shaping East Asia &apos;s future . 
Indeed , the uncertainty about whether two of APEC &apos;s key leaders will even speak to each other highlights the grim reality of Asian international relations today . 
The supposed &quot; Asian century &quot; is being thwarted by a paradox : deep economic interdependence has done nothing to alleviate strategic mistrust . 
Given the recent deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations - a decline that accelerated in 2012 , when Japan purchased the disputed Senkaku Islands ( Diaoyu Islands in Chinese ) from their private owner to prevent Japanese nationalists from taking control of them - the mere fact that Abe will attend the summit is a major step . 
A meeting between Abe and Xi - their first since either came to power - would offer concrete grounds for hope . 
The Japanese government has made significant diplomatic efforts to orchestrate a meeting , with former Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda visiting Beijing in July to try to ease tensions . 
According to some media reports , in order to secure China &apos;s agreement to participate in a meeting during the APEC summit , Abe even agreed to acknowledge that Japan &apos;s claim to the Senkaku Islands is disputed . 
Given that such a move would imply that China &apos;s claim to the islands may have some legitimacy , Abe &apos;s possible concession on this point is no trivial matter ; it could even mean that he will agree with China to restore the status quo ante . 
In that case , one hopes that Xi will follow Deng Xiaoping &apos;s counsel and allow the issue to be &quot; shelved for some time &quot; so that the &quot; wiser &quot; next generation can &quot; find a solution acceptable to all . &quot; 
That now seems to be a realistic possibility . 
Indeed , lately Xi seems to have softened his tone , if not necessarily his diplomatic line . 
For example , he allowed Li Xiaolin , the daughter of a former Chinese president , to meet with Abe , with whom she watched a performance by a visiting Chinese dance troupe in Tokyo . 
And Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang shook hands with Abe at the recent Asia-Europe Meeting in Milan . 
One reason for Abe and Xi &apos;s newfound flexibility may be domestic political shifts in both countries , which have created a more equal balance between conservative , nationalist groups and more internationally-oriented business interests . 
With both leaders having spent the last two years overcoming domestic opponents and consolidating their power , they may have gained confidence in their ability to compromise . 
In Japan , Abe has satisfied his conservative supporters with cabinet resolutions to allow for expanded self-defense . 
Despite domestic opposition to Japan &apos;s new security doctrine , no politically influential group was able to organize an effective challenge to Abe &apos;s approach . 
Now , as Japan &apos;s economic recovery stalls , the country &apos;s business sector seems to be pressuring Abe &apos;s government to work harder to mitigate the impact of its deteriorating relationship with China . 
According to a Chinese government report , in the first half of 2014 , Japanese direct investment in China was almost 50 % lower than during the same period last year - a clear sign that Japanese business leaders fear for the future in Japan &apos;s second largest market . 
Meanwhile , in China , Xi has gained considerable confidence through his massive anti-corruption campaign , with the punishment of top military officers indicating that he has solidified his control over the People &apos;s Liberation Army ( PLA ) . 
As a result , Xi may believe that he now has more space to address the country &apos;s economic slowdown , including by lessening the damage wrought by weakening ties with Japan . 
If this assessment is accurate , the obvious next question is how much further Abe and Xi can move toward d√©tente , thereby appeasing their business sectors , without losing the backing of nationalists , who tend to view the bilateral relationship as a zero-sum game . 
For Abe , the choice is whether to tone down his nationalist rhetoric and moderate his position on contentious historical issues . 
This would include halting visits to the controversial Yasukuni shrine ( which honors , among others , 14 Class A war criminals who were executed after World War II ) and abandoning revisionism regarding the Korean &quot; comfort women &quot; who were forced to provide sexual services to the Japanese Imperial Army . 
How Abe decides is likely to depend on his confidence in his political position . 
Similarly , if Xi remains confident enough in his control of the PLA and truly follows China &apos;s official policy of &quot; peaceful development , &quot; he will be able to take the kind of prudent approach that Deng advocated . 
This would entail recognizing and trying to assuage the fears that China &apos;s rise is causing among its neighbors , as Otto von Bismarck did after German unification in 1871 . 
Observers might then read his recent efforts to improve relations with Japan , not to mention Vietnam , as a genuine strategic shift , rather than a temporary tactical adjustment . 
In this uncertain context , the APEC summit could shed much-needed light on the intentions of Abe and Xi , thereby providing crucial insight into the trajectory of Sino-Japanese relations - and thus the future of East Asia .
