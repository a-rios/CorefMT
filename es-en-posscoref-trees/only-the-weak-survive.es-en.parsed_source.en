Only the Weak Survive 
TOKYO - The risk of global currency and trade wars is rising , with most economies now engaged in competitive devaluations . 
All are playing a game that some must lose . 
Today &apos;s tensions are rooted in paralysis on global rebalancing . 
Over-spending countries - such as the United States and other &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; economies - that were over-leveraged and running current-account deficits now must save more and spend less on domestic demand . 
To maintain growth , they need a nominal and real depreciation of their currency to reduce their trade deficits . 
But over-saving countries - such as China , Japan , and Germany - that were running current-account surpluses are resisting their currencies &quot; nominal appreciation . 
A higher exchange rate would reduce their current-account surpluses , because they are unable or unwilling to reduce their savings and sustain growth through higher spending on domestic consumption . 
Within the eurozone , this problem is exacerbated by the fact that Germany , with its large surpluses , can live with a stronger euro , whereas the PIIGS ( Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece , and Spain ) cannot . 
On the contrary , with their large external deficits , the PIIGS need a sharp depreciation to restore growth as they implement painful fiscal and other structural reforms . 
A world where over-spending countries need to reduce domestic demand and boost net exports , while over-saving countries are unwilling to reduce their reliance on export-led growth , is a world where currency tensions must inevitably come to a boil . 
Aside from the eurozone , the US , Japan , and the United Kingdom all need a weaker currency . 
Even Switzerland is intervening to weaken the franc . 
Meanwhile , China is intervening massively to resist appreciation of the renminbi and thus maintain its export performance . 
As a result , most emerging-market economies are now similarly worried about currency appreciation , lest they lose competitiveness relative to China , and are intervening aggressively and / or imposing capital controls to stem upward exchange-rate pressure . 
The trouble , of course , is that not all currencies can be weak at the same time : if one is weaker , another must , by definition , be stronger . 
Likewise , not all economies can improve net exports at the same time : the global total is , by definition , equal to zero . 
So the competitive devaluation war in which we find ourselves is a zero-sum game : one country &apos;s gain is some other country &apos;s loss . 
The first salvos in this war came in the form foreign-exchange intervention . 
To diversify away from US dollar assets while maintaining its effective dollar peg , China started to buy Japanese yen and South Korean won , hurting their competitiveness . 
So the Japanese started to intervene to weaken the yen . 
This intervention upset the EU , as it has put upward pressure on the euro at a time when the European Central Bank has placed interest rates on hold while the Bank of Japan ( BoJ ) and the US Federal Reserve are easing monetary policy further . 
The euro &apos;s rise will soon cause massive pain to the PIIGS , whose recessions will deepen , causing their sovereign risk to rise . 
The Europeans have thus already started verbal currency intervention and may soon be forced to make it formal . 
In the US , influential voices are proposing that the authorities respond to China &apos;s massive accumulation of dollar reserves by selling an equivalent amount of dollars and buying an equivalent amount of renminbi . 
Meanwhile , China and most emerging markets are accelerating their currency interventions to prevent more appreciation . 
The next stage of these wars is more quantitative easing , or QE2 . 
The BoJ has already announced it , the Bank of England ( BoE ) is likely to do so soon , and the Fed will certainly announce it at its November meeting . 
In principle , there is little difference between monetary easing - lower policy rates or more QE - that leads to currency weakening and direct intervention in currency markets to achieve the same goal . 
In fact , quantitative easing is a more effective tool to weaken a currency , as foreign exchange intervention is usually sterilized . 
Expectations of aggressive QE by the Fed have already weakened the dollar and raised serious concerns in Europe , emerging markets , and Japan . 
Indeed , though the US pretends not to intervene to weaken the dollar , it is actively doing precisely that via more QE . 
The BoJ and the BoE are following suit , putting even more pressure on the eurozone , where a stubborn ECB would rather kill any chance of recovery for the PIIGS than do more QE , ostensibly owing to fears of a rise in inflation . 
But that is a phantom risk , because it is the risk of deflation , not inflation , that haunts the PIIGS . 
Currency wars eventually lead to trade wars , as the recent US congressional threat against China shows . 
With US unemployment and Chinese growth both at almost 10 % , the only mystery is that the drums of trade war are not louder than they are . 
If China , emerging markets , and other surplus countries prevent nominal currency appreciation via intervention - and prevent real appreciation via sterilization of such intervention - the only way deficit countries can achieve real depreciation is via deflation . 
That will lead to double-dip recession , even larger fiscal deficits , and runaway debt . 
If nominal and real depreciation ( appreciation ) of the deficit ( surplus ) countries fails to occur , the deficit countries &quot; falling domestic demand and the surplus countries &quot; failure to reduce savings and increase consumption will lead to a global shortfall in aggregate demand in the face of a capacity glut . 
This will fuel more global deflation and private and public debt defaults in debtor countries , which will ultimately undermine creditor countries &quot; growth and wealth .
