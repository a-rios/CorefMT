A Good Rate Hike for Europe 
Two wrongs don &apos;t make a right . 
Just because European governments have failed to put bread on their constituents &quot; tables doesn &apos;t mean that the European Central Bank should likewise fail in its job of promoting price stability in the euro zone . 
That may sound obvious , but abandoning price stability is exactly what some European politicians are advocating . 
For example , Italian politicians , who , given Italy &apos;s recent dismal economic performance , would seem the least qualified to offer the ECB advice on monetary policy , are nonetheless advocating interest-rate cuts . 
Echoing comments by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , Deputy Economics Minister Mario Baldassarri said in Il Sole 24 Ore last week that all efforts to boost growth are in vain &quot; if someone is pushing on the brake pedal . &quot; 
Who &apos;s he kidding ? 
If anyone is &quot; pushing down on the Italian growth brake &quot; it is Berlusconi himself . 
He has made no efforts at economic reform during his term and now seeks to blame the ECB for Italy &apos;s lame economic performance . 
But it is precisely the lack of economic reform at home that has made Italy one of the least competitive states in the euro-zone economy . 
More than the usual &quot; blame game &quot; is at work here . 
Pressures are mounting on the ECB to raise interest rates - and Berlusconi and Co . &quot; s attacks are as much as an attempt to forestall future rate hikes as to get the ECB to loosen its monetary policy . 
Soaring energy prices , for example , have become a leading inflation risk . 
The key will be so-called &quot; second-round effects &quot; - whether growing crude prices lead to higher wage demands from trade unions . 
So far , the &quot; social partners , &quot; as ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet likes to call the unions , have been quiet . 
Should this change , the ECB will have to raise rates even if Europe &apos;s economic growth remains slack . 
The good news is that economic growth in the euro-zone economy appears to be picking up ( even in Italy ) . 
Though second-quarter GDP growth was weak - the euro-zone average was only 0.3 % year on year - third-quarter data are indicating a sustained economic pick-up in the second half of the year . 
Only consumption is lagging . 
How will the ECB react to better economic news ? 
Some on the Governing Council have grown uncomfortable that euro-zone interest rates have stayed so low , at 2 % , for so long ( more than two years ) . 
True , there is no inflation problem in the short run , but the ECB &apos;s monetary policy focuses on the medium term . 
One particular worry is that euro-zone money supply is well above the ECB &apos;s benchmark level , indicating an excess supply of liquidity . 
It is doubtful that the ECB would raise interest rates to curb excess liquidity so long as economic recovery remains in question . 
Slow growth has silenced the monetarists on the ECB &apos;s Governing Council . 
This will change , however , once the economic pick-up is confirmed . 
Interest-rate hikes may be coming sooner rather than later , which is why Berlusconi and French President Jacques Chirac are talking up interest-rate cuts now . 
Meanwhile , in Germany , the elections this September may have surprising consequences for ECB monetary policy . 
Angela Merkel , the Christian Democrats &quot; candidate , is a reformer , holding out hope for Germany &apos;s future - and that of Europe . 
Unfortunately , Merkel &apos;s campaign is off to a rocky start , and the recent entry of Oskar Lafontaine &apos;s extreme left-wing party into the fray may necessitate the formation of a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats . 
This would be bad news for the German economy , which could delay possible ECB interest rate hikes . 
Because the expected gridlock in parliament would make reforms less likely , companies might hold off on investment , while consumers would be more likely to keep their wallets closed , because official policy would be even less clear than it is now . 
On the other hand , a center-right coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats could spark the ECB into action . 
This raises an interesting point . 
The public should be relieved if the ECB raises rates , because this would most likely signal that the long-awaited economic recovery is well under way , and that inflationary repercussions are being addressed . 
A hike , in other words , would indicate that good things are happening . 
But the public often views interest-rate increases as negative events that increase unemployment and stifle growth . 
Blame-game politicians like Berlusconi , who have failed to put bread on the table , their minions in the media , and Keynesian economic professors who don &apos;t understand and misrepresent Keynes sustain this distorted view . 
Europe would be a lot better off if someone told the public the truth .
