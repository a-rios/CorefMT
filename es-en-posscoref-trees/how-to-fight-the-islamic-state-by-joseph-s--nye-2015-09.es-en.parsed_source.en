How to Fight the Islamic State 
CAMBRIDGE - The Islamic State has captured the world &apos;s attention with gruesome videos of beheadings , wanton destruction of antiquities , and skilled use of social media . 
It has also captured a large part of eastern Syria and western Iraq , proclaimed a caliphate based in Raqqa , Syria , and attracted foreign jihadists from around the world . 
US President Barack Obama says that the Islamic State must be degraded and ultimately defeated . 
He has appointed General John Allen to lead a coalition of some 60 countries in the task , relying on air strikes , special forces , and training missions . 
Some critics want him to send more American troops ; others say that the United States should settle for a doctrine of containment . 
In the current US presidential campaign , some candidates are calling for &quot; boots on the ground . &quot; 
They are right : boots are needed . 
And that says a lot about the nature of the triple threat that the US and its allies now face . 
The Islamic State is three things : a transnational terrorist group , a proto-state , and a political ideology with religious roots . 
It grew out of al-Qaeda after the misguided US-led invasion of Iraq ; and , like al-Qaeda , it appeals to extremist Sunni Islamists . 
Its possession of territory creates the legitimacy and capacity for offensive jihad , which it wages not only against infidels but also Shia and Sufi Muslims , whom it considers &quot; takfir , &quot; or not true Islamic monotheists . 
The Islamic State extols the purity of seventh-century Islam , but it is extremely adept at using twenty-first-century media . 
Its videos and social-media channels are effective tools for attracting a minority of Muslims - primarily young people from Europe , America , Africa , and Asia - who are struggling with their identity . 
Disgruntled , many are drawn to &quot; Sheikh Google , &quot; where Islamic State recruiters wait to prey upon them . 
By some estimates , there are more than 25,000 foreign fighters serving in the Islamic State today . 
Those who are killed are quickly replaced . 
The tripartite nature of the Islamic State creates a policy dilemma . 
On the one hand , it is important to use hard military power to deprive the caliphate of the territory that provides it both sanctuary and legitimacy . 
That is why the boots on the ground must be Sunni . 
The presence of foreign or Shia troops reinforces the Islamic State &apos;s claim of being surrounded and challenged by infidels . 
So far , thanks largely to effective Kurdish forces , who are overwhelmingly Sunni , the Islamic State has lost some 30 % of the territory it held a year ago . 
After the debacle in Libya ( where the Islamic State supports jihadist militias and has announced the creation of three &quot; distant provinces &quot; ) , Obama is understandably reluctant to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , only to see the Islamic State take control of more territory , accompanied by genocidal atrocities against Syria &apos;s many non-Sunnis . 
Many foreign jihadists respond to the prospect of helping to overthrow a tyrannical Alawite ruler who is killing Sunnis . 
The US diplomatic task is to persuade Assad &apos;s supporters , Russia and Iran , to remove him without dismantling the remains of the Syrian state structure . 
A no-fly zone and a safe zone in northern Syria for the millions of displaced people could reinforce American diplomacy . 
As it stands , the funding and coordination of America &apos;s soft-power strategy is inadequate . 
Even if the US and its allies defeat the Islamic State over the coming decade , we should be prepared for a similar Sunni extremist group to rise from the ashes . 
Revolutions of the type the Middle East is experiencing take a long time to resolve . 
The sources of revolutionary instability include tenuous post-colonial boundaries ; arrested modernization ; the failed &quot; Arab Spring &quot; ; and religious sectarianism , exacerbated by the interstate rivalry between Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia and Shia-ruled Iran . 
In Europe , wars of religion between Catholics and Protestants lasted for nearly a century and a half . 
The fighting ended ( with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 ) only after Germany lost a quarter of its population in the Thirty Years &quot; War . 
But it is also worth remembering that the coalitions of that time were complex , with Catholic France aiding Dutch Protestants against Catholic Habsburgs for dynastic rather than religious reasons . 
We should expect similar complexity in today &apos;s Middle East . 
Looking ahead in a region where the US has interests as varied as energy , Israel &apos;s security , nuclear non-proliferation , and human rights , American policymakers will need to follow a flexible strategy of &quot; containment plus nudging , &quot; which implies siding with different states and groups in different circumstances . 
For example , whether or not Iranian policy becomes more moderate , sometimes Iran will share US interests , and sometimes it will oppose them . 
In fact , the recent nuclear agreement may open opportunities for greater flexibility . 
To seize them , however , US foreign policy toward the Middle East will have to develop a higher level of sophistication than the current debate reveals .
