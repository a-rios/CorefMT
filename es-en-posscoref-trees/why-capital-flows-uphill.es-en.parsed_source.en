Why Capital Flows Uphill 
LONDON - At first , it seems difficult to grasp : global capital is flowing from poor to rich countries . 
Emerging-market countries run current-account surpluses , while advanced economies have deficits . 
One would expect fast-growing , capital-scarce ( and young ) developing countries to be importing capital from the rest of world to finance consumption and investment . 
So , why are they sending capital to richer countries , instead ? 
China is a case in point . 
With its current-account surplus averaging 5.5 % of GDP in 2000-2008 , China has become one of the world &apos;s largest lenders . 
Despite its rapid growth and promising investment opportunities , the country has persistently been sending a significant portion of its savings overseas . 
And China is not alone . 
Other emerging markets - including Brazil , Russia , India , Mexico , Argentina , Thailand , Indonesia , Malaysia , and the Middle Eastern oil exporters - have all increased their current-account surpluses significantly since the early 1990 &quot; s . 
Collectively , capital-scarce developing countries are lending to capital-abundant advanced economies . 
Many observers believe that these global imbalances reflect developing economies &quot; financial integration , coupled with underdevelopment of domestic financial markets . 
According to this view , these countries &quot; demand for assets cannot be met - in terms of both quantity and quality - at home , so they deploy part of their savings to countries like the US , which can offer a more diverse array of quality assets . 
While plausible , this argument suggests that , as financial markets improve over time in developing countries , the global imbalances are bound to shrink . 
But such a reversal is nowhere in sight . 
Why ? 
A crucial dimension of globalization has been trade liberalization . 
For China , foreign trade as a percentage of GDP soared from 25 % in 1989 to 66 % in 2006 , largely owing to its admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001 . 
Most of what China and other developing countries produce and export are labor-intensive goods such as textiles and apparel . 
This has allowed advanced economies , in turn , to produce and export more capital-intensive , higher-value-added products . 
Globalization of trade enabled countries to tap the efficiency gains that specialization in their sectors of comparative advantage has brought about . 
With a slight mental stretch , one can imagine that what a country produces and trades may affect its savings and investment decisions . 
An economy in which the main productive activity is berry picking , for example , has little need for investment and capital accumulation . 
Its laborers earn wages , consume , and save part of that income . 
Since the production process requires little capital , there is no demand for domestic investment - and thus no savings vehicles . 
Instead , the only way to save is by purchasing capital abroad - in economies with capital-intensive production and demand for investment . 
This economy will always export its savings . 
That may be an extreme example , but it illustrates a more general point about how merchandise trade can influence financial flows . 
Countries that produce and export more labor-intensive goods - perhaps owing to increased trade openness , or faster labor-force and productivity growth , all of which are true of China - may experience a rise in saving , but a less-than-equivalent increase in demand for capital . 
Rich countries , by contrast , are able to export more capital-intensive goods , and thus have a greater need for investment . 
So they may be importing more capital - resulting in a greater current-account deficit - simply because they are producing more capital-intensive goods . 
With developing countries - in particular , China , India , and the ex-Soviet bloc - bringing almost 1.5 billion workers into the world economy since the early 1990 &quot; s , it is not difficult to understand the potential impact of this effect . 
After all , much of this labor force was absorbed by labor-intensive industries that eventually churned out products exported to the rest of the world . 
Indeed , that massive addition of labor helped to drive down the relative price of labor-intensive goods , which fell by roughly 15 % between 1989 and 2008 . 
As developing countries increased their labor-intensive production and exports , their current-account surpluses rose - by almost 3.6 percentage points , on average , between 1989-1993 and 2002-2006 . 
China &apos;s current-account surplus increased by almost 11 percentage points over the same period , India &apos;s by 2.5 percentage points , and Russia &apos;s by seven percentage points . 
These countries , as well as other large surplus economies , such as Brazil , Saudi Arabia , and Iran , all experienced a simultaneous increase in the labor content of exports . 
This pattern contrasts with that of the United States and many other advanced countries , which have experienced a deterioration of their current-account balances as their production and exports have become more capital-intensive . 
Many might doubt the view that China is exporting more labor-intensive goods , rather than upgrading its exports on the capital- and skill-intensity ladder . 
But trade data suggest the opposite , perhaps because China &apos;s accession to the WTO led to tariff reductions that released more labor-intensive production . 
In fact , trade data may underestimate the true extent of China &apos;s labor intensity andoverstate the capital and skill intensity of China &apos;s exports . 
China has witnessed rapid growth in the processing trade : assembling intermediate inputs - imported from countries like the US and Japan - that have high capital and skill content . 
So , while the exports of these final goods may count towards China &apos;s own capital and skill content , the country &apos;s real role was only in the labor-intensive process of assembly . 
A country &apos;s production structure may very well determine how much capital it supplies and how much it needs . 
So the fact that capital may flow towards rich countries that produce and export more capital-intensive goods should not be so puzzling , after all .
