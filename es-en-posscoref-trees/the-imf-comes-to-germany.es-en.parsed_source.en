The IMF Comes to Germany 
Horst Koehler &apos;s departure as Managing Director of the IMF to seek election as President of Germany provides an occasion for a moment of reflection , both about the Fund and the state of economics . 
On the eve of Koehler &apos;s arrival as Managing Director , the world had experienced a period of financial turbulence not seen since the 1930 &apos;s . 
Confidence in the IMF was at an all time low . 
It had badly mismanaged the East Asian crisis , the Russian crisis , and the Brazilian crisis . 
A cloud hung over his predecessor . 
Surely , in choosing its leader , an international public institution should look for the most qualified person , and the choice should be made in as open and transparent manner as possible . 
Principles of democratic accountability , about which the IMF spoke forcefully in the developing world , demanded this . 
Yet in the end , an agreement between America and Europe dictated that the leader of the IMF should be a European . 
The Europeans then agreed that Germany had not had its fair turn at the leadership of a major international organization , and so the choice was a simple one : a German acceptable to America would get the job . 
Experience in developing countries , where virtually all of the crises with which the IMF has had to deal occur , was not even thought to be a pre-requisite ! 
In the last three years , much has changed - but much remains the same . 
It appears that the selection of the new IMF managing director will be no more open than the last . 
If confidence in the IMF is slightly higher than it was at its all-time low , its performance has been mixed . 
The rhetoric has certainly improved . 
The Fund now openly talks about the need to focus on poverty , and it candidly acknowledges that it had imposed too much conditionality when providing financing to poor countries . 
With the successive failures of IMF bailouts , the Fund has been looking for alternative strategies for handling crises . 
It has yet to find one . 
But at least it now recognizes that capital market liberalization ­ - long the centerpiece of its agenda - did not bring developing countries faster growth , only more instability . 
These are big changes , and they should be lauded . 
But on the fundamental questions of economic management , the record is far less positive . 
It is almost unanimously recognized that Argentina was badly handled , with recovery beginning only after the authorities abandoned the IMF &apos;s strictures . 
Lending resumed when the authorities made it clear that Argentina would rather default than let the IMF continue to dictate policies that had contributed to disaster in the first place . 
In Brazil , the IMF is given credit for averting another disaster , but at what price ? 
The economy has virtually stagnated , making it impossible for President Lula to advance the social goals on which he had run for office . 
The IMF &apos;s economic framework still does not provide for countercyclical fiscal policies , because the IMF remains ambivalent about the standard Keynesian prescription of stimulating an economy in a downturn . 
In Brazil and elsewhere , the IMF &apos;s distorted accounting frameworks ­ - what it does and does not count as expenditures - continues to impede the investments required to modernize public-sector enterprises and to put a major roadblock in the way of land reform . 
For example , when the government borrows to buy land , it is treated as debt , but the offsetting transaction when it sells the land through a mortgage effectively goes unrecognized . 
While the President of Germany is not supposed to intervene in the day-to-day management of the country , his voice will no doubt be influential . 
It is here that Germany should take pause and look at the record . 
Clearly , Germany faces many difficulties ; most economists agree that reunification was mishandled and the burden on the German economy correspondingly excessive . 
European enlargement , creating large numbers of lower-wage workers at Germany &apos;s borders , will pose new challenges . 
Economists differ on how best to meet these challenges . 
But the IMF &apos;s track record on diagnosing problems and prescribing solutions is not enviable . 
Its conservative philosophy has consistently failed to produce economic growth , and the benefits of what growth has occurred have disproportionately gone to the wealthy . 
Latin America , where the Fund &apos;s doctrines have been taken most seriously , has suffered far slower growth as a result . 
Indeed , growth in the 1990 &apos;s was little more than half the rate recorded in the pre-reform decades of the 1960 &apos;s and 1970 &apos;s . 
Meanwhile , East Asia , where governments eschewed these doctrines and were active in promoting growth has seen incomes soar and poverty plummet - despite the crisis of 1997 . 
In Europe , the record of &quot; conservative &quot; economic prescriptions is little better . 
The contractionary fiscal and monetary policies imposed by the Stability Pact and a European Central Bank fixated on inflation have taken a heavy toll . 
The strong Euro has made matters worse . 
Europe needs structural reforms , but such reforms alone will not end the Continent &apos;s malaise , and some measures - those that weaken employment protection or the social safety net - may come at a high price , especially for people at the bottom . 
Sweden has shown that there is another model of a market economy . 
While it has trimmed its welfare state , it has not abandoned it . 
Economic performance equals or exceeds that in most of the rest of Europe . 
Germany will be sadly disappointed if it thinks that by veering in the direction of economic conservatism , it will rise out of its current doldrums .
