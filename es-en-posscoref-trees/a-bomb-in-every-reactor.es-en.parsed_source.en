A Bomb in Every Reactor 
BERLIN - Twenty-five years after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl , the ongoing catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan has - it must be hoped - made clear once and for all that the purported blessings of the nuclear age are mere illusions : nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap . 
Indeed , the opposite is true . 
Nuclear power is saddled with three major unresolved risks : plant safety , nuclear waste , and , most menacing of all , the risk of military proliferation . 
Moreover , the alternatives to nuclear energy - and to fossil fuels - are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable . 
Taking on nuclear risk is not a necessity ; it is a deliberate political choice . 
Fossil-fuel and nuclear energy belong to the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , which were based on a belief in the innocence of the technologically feasible and on the fact that , at the time , only a minority of people worldwide , largely in the West , benefited from technological progress . 
By contrast , the twenty-first century will be informed by the realization that the global ecosystem and its resources , which are indispensable for human survival , are finite , and that this implies an enduring responsibility to preserve what we have . 
Meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity . 
The energy future of nine billion people , which is what the world population will be in the middle of the century , lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear energy , but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency . 
We already know this . 
Why , then , do the most advanced countries , in particular , take on the risk of a mega-catastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission ? 
The answer , ultimately , doesn &apos;t lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy , but first and foremost with its military applications . 
The energy derived from splitting uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon , the atomic bomb . 
Being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and prestige . 
Even today , the Bomb divides the world into two classes : the few states have it , and the many that do not . 
The old Cold War world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers , the United States and Soviet Union . 
To stop others from trying to become nuclear powers , which would have multiplied and spread the risk of nuclear confrontation , the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) was framed in the 1960 &quot; s . 
Of course , the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it . 
To this day , therefore , the risk remains that the number of nuclear powers will increase , particularly given small and medium powers &quot; hope to enhance their prestige and position in regional conflicts . 
Iran is the most current example of this . 
The nuclearization of these not-always-stable states threatens to make the regional conflicts of the twenty-first century much more dangerous , and will also substantially increase the risk that nuclear weapons eventually end up in the hands of terrorists . 
Despite the NPT , a clear separation between civilian and military use of nuclear energy hasn &apos;t always worked , or worked completely , because the NPT &apos;s rules permit all signatory states to develop and use - under international supervision - all of the components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes . 
From here , then , all that is required to become a nuclear power are a few small technical steps and political leaders &quot; decision to take them . 
This political power , not the requirements of energy policy , is what makes giving up nuclear energy so difficult . 
As a rule , the path to nuclear-power status always begins with so-called &quot; civilian &quot; nuclear programs . 
The supposed &quot; civilian &quot; nuclear ambitions of Iran have thus , for instance , led to a large number of such &quot; civilian &quot; programs in neighboring states . 
Honni soit qui mal y pense ! 
And , of course , the reactions of the nuclear powers to the disaster at Fukushima will be watched and analyzed closely by the so-called &quot; clandestine threshold countries . &quot; 
So how will the world - first and foremost , the main nuclear powers - react to the Fukushima disaster ? 
Will the tide truly turn , propelling the world towards nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear weapons ? 
Or will we witness attempts to downplay the calamity and return to business as usual as soon as possible ? 
Fukushima has presented the world with a far-reaching , fundamental choice . 
It was Japan , the high-tech country par excellence ( not the latter-day Soviet Union ) that proved unable to take adequate precautions to avert disaster in four reactor blocks . 
What , then , will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin - with the active assistance of the nuclear powers - to acquire civilian nuclear-energy capabilities ? 
Any decision to continue as before would send an unambiguous message to the clandestine threshold countries that are secretly pursuing nuclear weapons : despite lofty rhetoric and wordy documents , the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course . 
Were they to abandon nuclear energy , however , their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security - and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation .
