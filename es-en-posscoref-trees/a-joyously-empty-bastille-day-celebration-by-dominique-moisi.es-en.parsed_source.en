France &apos;s Midsummer Night &apos;s Dream 
PARIS - Bastille Day , the French national holiday , was glorious this year . 
The military parade , dominated by the celebration of &quot; victory &quot; in Mali and the joint participation of African and United Nations troops , had the perfection of a gracious , albeit muscular , ballet . 
The classical concert that preceded the magisterial fireworks that ended the day was the closest thing to a French version of the Proms in London , mixing light classical and popular songs . 
The Eiffel Tower imbued the evening with its magic . 
Paris , in case anyone had any lingering doubts , remains the capital of the world - or so it seemed for a night . 
The melancholia that began to seize France many years ago was all but forgotten . 
The celebration of the glory of the past , mixed with popular English songs of the present , seemed to indicate renewed national confidence . 
What was the meaning of this moment of grace ? 
Was it purely the product of a collective delusion , an emotional Potemkin village of sorts , encouraged , if not conceived , by the authorities to restore some level of self-assurance among France &apos;s depressed citizens ? 
Even if the positive emotions remain only fleeting ( as seems most likely ) , they were real and palpable . 
The French seemed to be in the mood to celebrate . 
Of course , it could simply have been the weather ; a gorgeous summer has finally settled in after a miserable spring . 
But it might also have been one of those natural turning points , a collective and spontaneous decision to say : &quot; Enough of depression , let &apos;s move on . &quot; 
We French may not be what we used to be , the celebrants seemed to be saying , but we are still much more than people think we are . 
We have a great revolutionary past that still conveys universal values - liberty , equality , fraternity - and an army that , as in Mali , continues to make a difference in the world . 
One can draw two lessons from this collective form of escapism . 
The first is that , beyond the many layers of depression and distrust in France , there is potential for a new and collective departure . 
This would require , of course , less cynical political elites who can transcend their petty ambitions and divisions for the sake of the country . 
The second lesson , even more obvious , is that reality cannot be changed with a simple public spectacle . 
France is not Imperial Rome , where panem et circenses made a fundamental difference . 
It is a weakened democracy mired in an economic and social crisis so deep that it verges on becoming an identity crisis . 
The proof was provided by a third traditional event on Bastille Day , between the morning &apos;s military parade and the evening &apos;s music and fireworks : President Fran√ßois Hollande &apos;s speech to the nation , which took the form of an interview with two prominent journalists . 
He , too , was in a reassuring mood . 
According to Hollande , the economic upturn - la reprise - had just started , and hope was around the corner . 
His tone and message had changed . 
He was no longer the &quot; normal man &quot; of his election campaign and tenure until now ; instead , he tried to present himself , like his predecessor , Nicolas Sarkozy , as a superhero . 
Of course , given his personality and low public-approval ratings , his address was the least convincing event of the day . 
Who could have said with certainty that the economic upturn announced by Hollande was real rather than aspirational ? 
Beyond his message &apos;s wishful thinking , the public &apos;s reaction to the messenger was a mixture of disbelief and indifference . 
Seeing the behavior of friends , all French , listening with me to Hollande , I was reminded of another moment . 
It was December 31 , 1989 , and I was in the Soviet Union . 
I was moved : The man who symbolized glasnost and perestroika , who had allowed the peaceful emancipation of most of Eastern and Central Europe , was speaking . 
But I was alone in paying attention to him . 
The restaurant &apos;s customers , like my French friends now , could not have cared less . 
Their president had become background noise . 
Has Hollande become , in this sense , a French Gorbachev ? 
For the left and the Greens , he is close to being a traitor . 
These voters chose him a year ago not only because he was not Sarkozy , but because he incarnated the values of the true left , even if his centrist moderation seemed a bad omen . 
Voters of the center or even the center-right are disappointed , too , by their president &apos;s lack of charisma , if not sheer incompetence . 
After a year of Hollande , France is witnessing a fundamental political revolution . 
During the half-century of the Fifth Republic , a bipartisan system of left and right has traditionally prevailed . 
But now France is becoming a country dominated by a &quot; tripartite system &quot; of more or less equal strength : the left , the right , and the extreme right . 
If France wants to capitalize on the positive emotions of Bastille Day , it needs much more responsible elites , ready to unite in the fight against unemployment and its causes ( lack of competitiveness and labor-market rigidity ) and consequences ( the rise of populist , non-republican forces ) . 
What Bastille Day revealed , even briefly and superficially , is that the potential to unite France exists . 
But doing so requires more than shallow promises .
