The German Hour 
BRUSSELS - A series of developments over the last few weeks have set in motion a downward spiral for the eurozone . 
Unless officials - especially German officials - act fast , the verdict of financial markets is bound to be ruthless . 
First , the eurozone has failed to turn the tide . 
Mario Draghi , President of the European Central Bank , was right to note that , despite numerous ministerial meetings and three summits , implementation of the decision to increase significantly the firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) is still lacking . 
There are now growing doubts about the effectiveness of the EFSF . 
Second , and partly as a consequence , virtually all eurozone countries &quot; debt is trading at a discount relative to German Bunds . 
While it was necessary to price risk more accurately , it is difficult to believe that the Netherlands , with a debt ratio nearly 20 percentage points lower than Germany &apos;s , deserves to be assessed as a higher default risk . 
But now even the mighty Bund has started to suffer from heightened market anxiety . 
Third , financial-market participants and , increasingly , real businesses are pricing in a possible breakup of the eurozone , if not the end of the euro itself . 
It is still difficult to think the unthinkable , let alone work out the details of it , but any rational player must now consider the possibility . 
If expectations of disaster build , and a growing number of players start positioning themselves to protect themselves , the consequences could become overwhelming . 
Not only the eurozone would suffer . 
Fourth , Germany has become the eurozone &apos;s undisputed leader . 
Although France continues to play its role as the other half of the European Union &apos;s leading couple , it has lost influence and the ability to take the initiative . 
A weaker French economy , shakier public finances , and the coming presidential election are all combining to alter the balance with Germany . 
Political audacity can carry France only so far . 
In this context , Germany again finds itself in a situation akin to that of the late 1980 &quot; s , when the Bundesbank was setting monetary policy for the rest of the continent . 
At that time , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wisely concluded that German economic dominance of Europe was not conducive to a stable equilibrium , and that a better plan for the future was to build on Germany &apos;s weight and influence to create a permanent common monetary order . 
Kohl &apos;s insight gave birth to the euro . 
Today , once again , it is in Germany &apos;s best interest to ensure lasting stability in Europe . 
With foreign assets worth â‚¬ 6 trillion ( $ 7.9 trillion ) , most of which consist of claims on its eurozone partners , Germany would lose out massively if the eurozone fragments . 
Claims on entities within partner countries would be redenominated in weaker currencies - or the borrowers would default on them . 
Obviously , German exporters would be hurt by substantial currency appreciation . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has sensibly decided to take the lead on reforming the eurozone . 
But many Germans feel deceived by some irresponsible eurozone partners , giving rise to the temptation to use Germany &apos;s current strength to toughen sanctions and coerce weaker countries into adopting constitutional changes , especially concerning fiscal policy . 
This is a risky attitude . 
To be sure , Germany has far more leverage today than it has had at any point in the last 20 years . 
But attempting to extract unilateral concessions from partners is a recipe for disappointment . 
It is one thing is to be sanctioned for breaching the rules , as with the Stability and Growth Pact ; it is quite another thing to permit elected national governments and parliaments to be overruled , and national budgets censored , by an unelected higher authority . 
The EU &apos;s members are unlikely to agree to major reform unless Germany offers something in return . 
Absent a more balanced deal , what is likely to emerge from negotiations is simply another layer of largely ineffectual and ultimately divisive sanctions . 
The natural quid pro quo for ex ante budgetary control is solidarity through the creation of Eurobonds . 
Joint and several liability for public bonds is imaginable only if countries offering their guarantee - and thus potential access to their taxpayers - can exercise veto power and prevent a partner country from issuing more debt . 
Thus , legally binding ex ante control is a necessary condition for Eurobonds . 
Conversely , surrendering budgetary sovereignty to eurozone partners is acceptable only if it accompanies their guarantee that they will come to the rescue in case of accident . 
Germany should be bold and use its leverage to offer a new contract to its eurozone partners : mutual guarantee of part of their public debt in exchange for strict debt limits and a new legal order in which a eurozone authority can veto an enacted budget even before it is implemented . 
Only such boldness will deliver the certainty that markets need - and it is Germany &apos;s responsibility to be bold .
