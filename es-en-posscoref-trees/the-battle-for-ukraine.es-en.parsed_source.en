The Battle for Ukraine 
The old axioms are true : firmness can pay ; resolution can see you through . 
We who are struggling to maintain our democracy in Ukraine believe this . 
Now , more than ever , we must believe this , for Russian troops wearing Ukrainian uniforms have entered our country , because Ukrainian soldiers are refusing to carry out orders to crush those who are demonstrating to defend our democracy . 
We will need the solidarity of our neighbors , and of freedom-loving peoples around the world , to assure that our democratic dreams are realized in peace . 
The struggle to secure the victory of Viktor Yushchenko , the true winner in last Sunday &apos;s presidential election , as Ukraine &apos;s new president is not one that we sought . 
But , that battle for our freedom having been imposed upon us , we will not be found wanting in either courage or resolve . 
The days and nights ahead will be difficult , and the secret presence of Russian troops will make them all the more dangerous . 
The forces of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych foolishly stuffed ballots and intimidated the country &apos;s electoral commission to an absurd degree . 
They then tried to force the Ukrainian people to swallow this sham - threatening to ban public gatherings , close our borders to new visa seekers , and silence any word of our protests on television . 
More and more members of a governmental machine that thought it could impose a fraudulent election on Ukraine &apos;s people are shying away from imposing that choice by force . 
Members of the army , the security services , and government officials are all balking at doing the bidding of the Yanukovych clique . 
Such a volatile ruling elite cannot be counted on to be consistent from now on . 
We recognize that an unstable government can swing back to uncompromising intransigence . 
It will try to erode our support by infiltrating our protests with loyalists who will carry the virus of defeatism , and it will seek to outflank us by appealing to ordinary , hard-working Ukrainians , worried about feeding and clothing their children , that a tottering economy needs stability to be saved . 
It will try to divide the country between Russian and Ukrainian speakers . 
But it is too late for divide and misrule strategies to work . 
Ukrainians know that the choice they make now , that their decision to stand firm with Viktor Yushchenko today , will determine their freedom forever , as well as the health of their nation - its independence as well as its economic strength . 
So we will stand firm in the cold and the snow to see that our democratic choices are respected . 
To do otherwise is to surrender not only our freedom , but our hopes for better lives . 
We defy those who seek to corrupt our democracy , but we stand with the hand of friendship extended to all of our neighbors , including Russia . 
It has no reason to intervene . 
A vibrant Ukrainian democracy will need the comradeship of Russia and of Europe to build the kind of society that our people desire . 
Our boldness is tinged by realism . 
By securing our democracy , we help secure Russia &apos;s own . 
For we are engaged not in revolution , but in peaceful democratic evolution . 
Ukrainians have endured the worst that man can do to his fellow man : Stalin &apos;s orchestrated famines of the 1930 &quot; s and the Nazi slaughterhouse of World War II . 
So do not doubt our ability to endure and stand firm . 
We shall persist , and our democracy shall prevail . 
Stand with us .
