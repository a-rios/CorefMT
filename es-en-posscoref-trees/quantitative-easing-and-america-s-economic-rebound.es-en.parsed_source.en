Quantitative Easing and America &apos;s Economic Rebound 
CAMBRIDGE - There is no doubt that the American economy rallied strongly at the end of 2010 . 
But how much of that was due to the United States Federal Reserve &apos;s temporary policy of so-called &quot; quantitative easing &quot; ? 
And what does the answer mean for the US economy in 2011 ? 
Until the fourth quarter of last year , the US economic recovery that began in the summer of 2009 was decidedly anemic . 
Annual GDP growth in the first three quarters of 2010 averaged only about 2.6 % - and most of that was just inventory building . 
Without the inventory investment , the growth rate of final sales averaged less than 1 % . 
But the fourth quarter was very different . 
Annual GDP rose by 3.2 % and growth of final sales jumped to a remarkable 7.1 % year-on-year rate . 
True , much of that was due to a sharp decline in imports ; but even the growth rate of final sales to domestic purchasers rose at a healthy 3.4 % pace . 
The key driver of the increase in final sales was a strong rise in consumer spending . 
Real personal consumer spending grew at a robust 4.4 % rate , as spending on consumer durables soared by 21 % . 
That meant that the acceleration of growth in consumer spending accounted for nearly 100 % of the increase in GDP , with the rise in durable spending accounting for almost half of that increase . 
The rise in consumer spending was not , however , due to higher employment or faster income growth . 
Instead , it reflected a fall in the personal saving rate . 
Household saving had risen from less than 2 % of after-tax incomes in 2007 to 6.3 % in the spring of 2010 . 
But then the saving rate fell by a full percentage point , reaching 5.3 % in December 2010 . 
A likely reason for the fall in the saving rate and resulting rise in consumer spending was the sharp increase in the stock market , which rose by 15 % between August and the end of the year . 
That , of course , is what the Fed had been hoping for . 
At the annual Fed conference at Jackson Hole , Wyoming in August , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke explained that he was considering a new round of quantitative easing ( dubbed QE2 ) , in which the Fed would buy a substantial volume of long-term Treasury bonds , thereby inducing bondholders to shift their wealth into equities . 
The resulting rise in equity prices would increase household wealth , providing a boost to consumer spending . 
To be sure , there is no proof that QE2 led to the stock-market rise , or that the stock-market rise caused the increase in consumer spending . 
But the timing of the stock-market rise , and the lack of any other reason for a sharp rise in consumer spending , makes that chain of events look very plausible . 
The magnitude of the relationship between the stock-market rise and the jump in consumer spending also fits the data . 
Since share ownership ( including mutual funds ) of American households totals approximately $ 17 trillion , a 15 % rise in share prices increased household wealth by about $ 2.5 trillion . 
The past relationship between wealth and consumer spending implies that each $ 100 of additional wealth raises consumer spending by about four dollars , so $ 2.5 trillion of additional wealth would raise consumer spending by roughly $ 100 billion . 
That figure matches closely the fall in household saving and the resulting increase in consumer spending . 
Since US households &quot; after-tax income totals $ 11.4 trillion , a one-percentage-point fall in the saving rate means a decline of saving and a corresponding rise in consumer spending of $ 114 billion - very close to the rise in consumer spending implied by the increased wealth that resulted from the gain in share prices . 
None of this appears to augur well for 2011 . 
There is no reason to expect the stock market to keep rising at the rapid pace of 2010 . 
Quantitative easing is scheduled to end in June 2011 , and the Fed is not expected to continue its massive purchases of Treasury bonds after that . 
Without that increase in stock-market wealth , will the saving rate continue to decline and the pace of consumer spending continue to rise more rapidly than GDP ? 
Will the strong economic growth at the end of 2010 be enough to propel more spending by households and businesses in 2011 , even though house prices continue to fall and the labor market remains weak ? 
And does artificial support for the bond market and equities mean that we are looking at asset-price bubbles that may come to an end before the year is over ? 
Only time will tell , of course . 
But these are the questions that investors and policymakers alike should be asking .
