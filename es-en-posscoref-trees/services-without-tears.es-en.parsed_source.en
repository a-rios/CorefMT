Services without Tears 
NEW YORK - A famous claim in economics is that the cost of services ( such as health care and education ) tends to increase relative to the cost of goods ( such as food , oil , and machinery ) . 
This seems right : people around the world can barely afford the rising health-care and school-tuition costs they currently face - costs that seem to increase each year faster than overall inflation . 
But a sharp decline in the costs of health care , education , and other services is now possible , thanks to the ongoing information and communications technology ( ICT ) revolution . 
The cost of services compared to the cost of goods depends on productivity . 
If farmers become much better at growing food while teachers become little better at teaching kids , the cost of food will tend to fall relative to the cost of education . 
Moreover , the proportion of the population engaged in farming will tend to fall , since fewer farmers are needed to feed the entire country . 
This is the long-term pattern that we &apos;ve seen : the share of the workforce in goods production has declined over time , while the cost of goods has fallen relative to that of services . 
In the United States , around 4 % of the population in 1950 was employed in agriculture , 38 % in industry ( including mining , construction , and manufacturing ) , and 58 % in services . 
By 2010 , the proportions were roughly 2 % , 17 % , and 81 % , respectively . 
In the meantime , health-care and tuition costs have soared , along with the costs of many other services . 
But a productivity revolution in service-sector delivery is now possible . 
As a professor , I feel it in my own classroom . 
Ever since I began teaching 30 years ago , it had seemed that the technology was rather fixed . 
I would stand before a class and give a one-hour lecture . 
Sure , the blackboard gave way to an overhead projector , and then to PowerPoint ; but , otherwise , the basic classroom &quot; production system &quot; seemed to change little . 
In the past two years , everything has changed - for the better . 
At eight on Tuesday mornings , we turn on a computer at Columbia University and join in a &quot; global classroom &quot; with 20 other campuses around the world . 
A professor or a development expert somewhere gives a talk , and many hundreds of students listen in through videoconferencing . 
Information technology is revolutionizing the classroom and driving down the costs of producing first-rate educational materials . 
Many universities are putting their classes online for free , so that anyone in the world can learn physics , math , or economics from world-class faculty . 
At Stanford University this fall , two computer-science professors put their courses online for students anywhere in the world ; now they have an enrollment of 58,000 . 
The same breakthroughs now possible in education can occur in health care . 
The US health-care system is notoriously expensive , partly because many of the key costs are controlled by the American Medical Association and private-sector health-insurance companies , which act like monopolists , driving up costs . 
Such monopoly pricing should be ended . 
Yet there are other reasons for high health-care costs . 
Many people suffer from chronic ailments , such as heart disease , diabetes , obesity , and depression and other mental disorders . 
These diseases can be expensive to address if they are poorly managed and treated . 
Far too many people end up in the emergency room and the hospital because they lacked the advice and help to keep their conditions under control without institutional care , or even to prevent their disorders entirely . 
Now information technology is coming to the rescue . 
Innovative companies like CareMore in California are using ICT to keep their clientele healthy and out of the hospital . 
For example , when CareMore &apos;s patients step on the scale at home each day , their weight is automatically transmitted to the health-care unit . 
If there is a dangerous weight swing , which could be caused by congestive heart failure , the clinic brings the patient in for a quick examination , thereby heading off a potentially devastating crisis . 
These innovative companies &quot; approaches combine three ideas . 
The first is to use ICT to help individuals monitor their health conditions , and to connect individuals with expert advice . 
The second is to empower outreach workers ( sometimes called &quot; community health workers &quot; ) to provide home-based care in order to prevent more serious illnesses and to cut down on the high costs of doctors and hospitals . 
The third idea is to recognize that many illnesses arise or become worse because of individuals &quot; social circumstances . 
Perhaps the patient is isolated , lonely , suffering from depression , out of work , or facing some other personal or family calamity . 
If these social conditions go unaddressed , they may give rise to an expensive , even deadly , medical condition . 
Smart healthcare is therefore holistic , helping people not only as patients arriving in the emergency room , but also as individuals and family members in their own homes and communities . 
Holistic health care is more humane , effective , and cost-efficient . 
The ICT revolution provides the means to achieve holistic health care in new and powerful ways . 
In economic terms , information and communications technologies are &quot; disruptive , &quot; meaning that they will outcompete the existing , more expensive ways of doing things . 
Implementing disruptive technologies is never easy . 
Existing high-cost producers , especially entrenched monopolists , resist . 
National budgets may continue to favor the old ways . 
Nevertheless , the promise of great cost savings and major advances in service delivery is at hand . 
The world &apos;s economies , rich and poor alike , have much to gain from accelerated innovation in the information age .
