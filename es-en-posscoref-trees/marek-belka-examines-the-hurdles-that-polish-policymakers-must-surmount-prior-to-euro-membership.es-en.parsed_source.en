Poland &apos;s Eurozone Tests 
WARSAW - The European Union &apos;s new member states from Central and Eastern Europe are required to join the eurozone as part of their accession agreements . 
At stake is not just an economic calculation , but also a judgment about the outlook of the single currency itself . 
For many , the benefits of membership have diminished since the financial crisis , and prospective members , such as Poland , can derive maximum advantage from joining only if they are clear about the economic conditions that must first prevail in their own countries . 
The formal criteria for entry are contained in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty , which sets targets for government debt , budget deficits , inflation , interest rates , and exchange rates . 
Indeed , the malleability of the Maastricht criteria has caused many of the eurozone &apos;s problems . 
As long as eurozone debts continue to rise and member economies diverge rather than converge , prospective members should also be stress-tested to see if they can withstand external shocks and sustain the membership criteria over the long term . 
Before Poland decides to share a currency with its main trading partners , it should consider three vital economic conditions : its international competitiveness , the flexibility of its labor market , and the health of its public finances . 
Poland &apos;s export markets are growing steadily . 
Rather , Poland simply combines low costs ( including wages ) and high-quality production . 
For this reason , Poland is sometimes called the &quot; China of Europe . &quot; 
But competitiveness based on cost , rather than brand value or innovation , makes the Polish economy vulnerable . 
Poland lacks the deeply rooted competitiveness of , say , Germany , the Netherlands , Austria , Sweden , or Switzerland . 
Polish exports are sold under non-Polish names ( Italian for shoes , for example , or English for clothing ) . 
Its machinery exports are part of larger multinational networks run by German , Dutch , or other global companies . 
Although Polish companies are working hard to build brands abroad , this can take decades . 
In the meantime , the country must be careful about joining the exchange rate mechanism ( ERM II ) - the narrow band within which applicant currencies must operate for at least two years prior to adopting the euro . 
Doing so could cause the z≈Çoty to strengthen , as it did to the Slovak koruna , and wipe out Poland &apos;s competitive advantage . 
Another important aspect of Poland &apos;s competitiveness is its flexible labor market . 
One in four employees is on a fixed-term contract or self-employed . 
A quarter of the typical Polish wage comprises variable elements , making it easy to freeze , or even lower , compensation during tougher economic times . 
This means that firms can hire workers on short-term contracts when they are unsure of the business outlook ; more generally , such flexibility helps the economy withstand external shocks . 
But flexible labor markets have disadvantages , too . 
Companies tend not to invest in talent or develop new skills , and the quality of existing skills can suffer . 
In the longer run , flexible labor markets also increase structural unemployment and fuel the informal economy . 
Furthermore , shortages in Poland &apos;s residential rental market restrict workers &quot; ability to move to where the jobs are . 
Arguably , Poland &apos;s labor market is more akin to Spain &apos;s than that of Scandinavia , where generous social protection allows for extensive employee training . 
Finally , Poland needs sound public finances - that is , fiscal space for automatic stabilizers during economic crises . 
By saving money for hard times , the government can implement countercyclical measures , while ensuring stable finances throughout the economic cycle . 
Such a policy was successfully implemented in 2009 and 2010 , but the government lacked the funds it needed when economic conditions subsequently deteriorated . 
Sound public finances require not only low public debt , but also appropriate budgetary policy , which includes cutting spending ( or raising taxes ) during boom times , not during downturns , as was recently the case . 
Broad-based competitiveness , truly flexible labor markets , and prudent budgeting are not beyond Poland &apos;s reach . 
In each case , there are other national examples to emulate : Switzerland &apos;s competitiveness , Denmark &apos;s labor markets , and Estonia &apos;s public finances , for example . 
Before Poland joins the eurozone , its economic policy should be directed toward these three criteria of long-term economic success .
