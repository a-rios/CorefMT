The Death-Defying Dollar 
BERKELEY - The blogosphere is abuzz with reports of the dollar &apos;s looming demise . 
The greenback has fallen against the euro by nearly 15 % since the beginning of the summer . 
Central banks have reportedly slowed their accumulation of dollars in favor of other currencies . 
One sensational if undocumented story has the Gulf States conspiring with China , Russia , Japan , and France - now there &apos;s an odd coalition for you - to shift the pricing of oil away from dollars . 
Economists have no trouble explaining the dollar &apos;s weakness after the fact . 
With American households saving more in order to rebuild their retirement accounts , the country has to export more . 
A weaker dollar is needed to make American goods more attractive to foreign consumers . 
Moreover , disenchantment with the sophisticated instruments that American financial institutions specialize in originating and distributing means more limited foreign capital flows into the United States . 
Fewer foreign purchases of US assets again imply a weaker dollar . 
Extrapolating the past into the future , forecasters predict that the dollar will decline further . 
The first thing to say about this is that one should be skeptical about economists &quot; predictions , especially those concerning the near term . 
Our models are , to put it bluntly , useless for predicting currency movements over a few weeks or months . 
I should know . 
When the sub-prime crisis erupted in early September 2007 , I published an article entitled &quot; Why Now is a Good Time to Sell the Dollar &quot; in a prominent financial publication . 
What happened next , of course , was that the dollar strengthened sharply , as investors , desperate for liquidity , fled into US Treasury securities . 
Subsequently the dollar did decline . 
But then it shot up again following the failure of Bear Stearns and the problems with AIG . 
Over periods of several years , our models do better . 
Over those time horizons , the emphasis on the need for the US to export more and on the greater difficulty the economy will have in attracting foreign capital are on the mark . 
These factors give good grounds for expecting further dollar weakness . 
The question is , Weakness against what ? 
Not against the euro , which is already expensive and is the currency of an economy with banking and structural problems that are even more serious than those of the US . 
Not against the yen , which is the currency of an economy that refuses to grow . 
Thus , for the dollar to depreciate further , it will have to depreciate against the currencies of China and other emerging markets . 
Their intervention in recent weeks shows a reluctance to let this happen . 
But their choice boils down to buying US dollars or buying US goods . 
The first option is a losing proposition . 
In the longer run , OPEC will shift to pricing petroleum in a basket of currencies . 
It sells its oil to the US , Europe , Japan , and emerging markets alike . 
It hardly makes sense for it to denominate oil prices in the currency of only one of its customers . 
And central banks , when deciding what to hold as reserves , will surely put somewhat fewer of their eggs in the dollar basket . 
Beyond this , the dollar isn &apos;t going anywhere . 
It is not about to be replaced by the euro or the yen , given that both Europe and Japan have serious economic problems of their own . 
The renminbi is coming , but not before 2020 , by which time Shanghai will have become a first-class international financial center . 
And , even then , the renminbi will presumably share the international stage with the dollar , not replace it . 
The one thing that could precipitate the demise of the dollar would be reckless economic mismanagement in the US . 
One popular scenario is chronic inflation . 
But this is implausible . 
Once the episode of zero interest rates ends , the US Federal Reserve will be anxious to reassert its commitment to price stability . 
There may be a temptation to inflate away debt held by foreigners , but the fact is that the majority of US debt is held by Americans , who would constitute a strong constituency opposing the policy . 
The other scenario is that US budget deficits continue to run out of control . 
Predictions of outright default are far-fetched . 
But high debts will mean high taxes . 
The combination of loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy will mean high interest rates , sluggish investment , and slow growth . 
Foreigners - and residents - might well grow disenchanted with the currency of an economy with these characteristics . 
Mark Twain , the nineteenth-century American author and humorist , once responded to accounts of his ill health by writing that &quot; reports of my death are greatly exaggerated . &quot; 
He might have been speaking about the dollar . 
For the moment , the patient is stable , external symptoms notwithstanding . 
But there will be grounds for worry if he doesn &apos;t commit to a healthier lifestyle .
