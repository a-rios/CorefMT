Barack Obama and American Power 
CAMBRIDGE - One of the first challenges that President Barack Obama will face is the effects of the ongoing financial crisis , which has called into question the future of American power . 
An article in The Far Eastern Economic Review proclaims that &quot; Wall Street &apos;s crack-up presages a global tectonic shift : the beginning of the decline of American power . &quot; 
Russian President Dmitri Medvedev sees the crisis as a sign that America &apos;s global leadership is coming to an end , and Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez has declared that Beijing is now much more relevant than New York . 
Yet the dollar , a symbol of American financial power , has surged rather than declined . 
As Kenneth Rogoff , a Harvard professor and former chief economist of the IMF notes , &quot; It is ironic , given that we just messed up big-time , that the response of foreigners is to pour more money into us . 
They &apos;re not sure where else to go . 
They seem to have more confidence in our ability to solve our problems than we do . &quot; 
It used to be said that when America sneezed , the rest of the world caught a cold . 
More recently , many claimed that with the rise of China and the petro-states , an American slowdown could be decoupled from the rest of the world . 
But when the United States caught the financial flu , others followed . 
Many foreign leaders quickly switched from schadenfreude to fear - and to the security of US treasury bills . 
Crises often refute conventional wisdom , and this one reveals that the underlying strength of the American economy remains impressive . 
The poor performance of Wall Street and America regulators has cost America a good deal in terms of the soft power of its economic model &apos;s attractiveness , but the blow need not be fatal if , in contrast to Japan in the 1990 &quot; s , the US manages to absorb the losses and limit the damage . 
The World Economic Forum still rates the American economy as the world &apos;s most competitive , owing to its labor-market flexibility , higher education , political stability , and openness to innovation . 
The larger question concerns the long-term future of American power . 
A new forecast for 2025 being prepared by the US National Intelligence Council projects that American dominance will be &quot; much diminished , &quot; and that the one key area of continued American superiority - military power - will be less significant in the competitive world of the future . 
This is not so much a question of American decline as &quot; the rise of the rest . &quot; 
Power always depends on context , and in today &apos;s world , it is distributed in a pattern that resembles a complex three-dimensional chess game . 
On the top chessboard , military power is largely unipolar and likely to remain so for a while . 
But on the middle chessboard , economic power is already multi-polar , with the US , Europe , Japan and China as the major players , and others gaining in importance . 
The bottom chessboard is the realm of transnational relations that cross borders outside of government control . 
It includes actors as diverse as bankers electronically transferring sums larger than most national budgets , as well as terrorists transferring weapons or hackers disrupting Internet operations . 
It also includes new challenges like pandemics and climate change . 
On this bottom board , power is widely dispersed , and it makes no sense to speak of unipolarity , multipolarity , or hegemony . 
Even in the aftermath of the financial crisis , the giddy pace of technological change is likely to continue to drive globalization , but the political effects will be different for the world of nation-states and the world of non-state actors . 
In inter-state politics , the most important factor will be the continuing &quot; return of Asia . &quot; 
In 1750 , Asia had three-fifths of the world population and three-fifths of the world &apos;s economic output . 
By 1900 , after the industrial revolution in Europe and America , Asia accounted for just one-fifth of world output . 
By 2040 , Asia will be well on its way back to its historical share . 
The rise of China and India may create instability , but it is a problem with precedents , and we can learn from history about how policies can affect the outcome . 
A century ago , Britain managed the rise of American power without conflict , but the world &apos;s failure to manage the rise of German power led to two devastating world wars . 
The rise of non-state actors also must be managed . 
In 2001 , a non-state group killed more Americans than the government of Japan killed at Pearl Harbor . 
A pandemic spread by birds or travelers on jet aircraft could kill more people than perished in World Wars I or II . 
The problems of the diffusion of power ( away from states ) may turn out to be more difficult than shifts in power between states . 
The challenge for Barack Obama is that more and more issues and problems are outside the control of even the most powerful state . 
Although the US does well on the traditional measures of power , those measures increasingly fail to capture much of what defines world politics , which , owing to the information revolution and globalization , is changing in a way that prevents Americans from achieving all their international goals by acting alone . 
For example , international financial stability is vital to American prosperity , but the US needs the cooperation of others to ensure it . 
Global climate change , too , will affect the quality of life , but the US cannot manage the problem alone . 
And , in a world where borders are becoming increasingly porous to everything from drugs to infectious diseases to terrorism , America must mobilize international coalitions to address shared threats and challenges . 
As the world &apos;s largest economy , American leadership will remain crucial . 
The problem of American power in the wake of the financial crisis is not one of decline , but of a realization that even the most powerful country cannot achieve its aims without the help of others . 
Fortunately , Barack Obama understands that .
