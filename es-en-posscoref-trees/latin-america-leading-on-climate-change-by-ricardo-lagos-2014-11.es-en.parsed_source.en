Latin America &apos;s Climate Vanguard 
SANTIAGO - Latin America may have weathered the global economic slowdown , but for many , the potential impact of global warming , and the measures required to avoid its worst effects , may undermine the region &apos;s fragile political , economic , and social balance - and roll back years of progress . 
But economic prosperity and action to mitigate climate change need not be mutually exclusive . 
Indeed , the current election cycle in Latin America , coupled with the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in December in Lima , Peru , provide an opportunity for the region to show how countries can benefit from a low-carbon economy , reduce climate risks , and build long-term prosperity . 
Latin American countries are not starting from scratch . 
Most governments are already crafting policies and drafting legislation on climate change . 
Mexico was the first emerging country to pass a comprehensive climate-change law , in 2012 , targeting a 30 % reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2020 . 
Brazil recently succeeded in reducing Amazonian deforestation , and net carbon-dioxide emissions have dropped significantly as a result . 
Uruguay plans to generate 90 % of its electricity from renewable sources by 2015 , while Chile aims to generate 20 % of its power with renewable energy by 2025 . 
As Latin America &apos;s 2014 election cycle draws to a close , new governments in Bolivia , Brazil , Colombia , and Costa Rica , and presidential hopefuls in Uruguay will be in a position to lead on climate change . 
At the very least , they must eschew strategies that needlessly undermine existing climate and environmental policies . 
At best , Latin American leaders can actively facilitate the upcoming Lima conference , which will charge delegates with producing a draft agreement for a new global treaty , to be finalized in Paris next year . 
The agreement must be both ambitious and fair , in order to form the basis for a global response to climate change that does not jeopardize any country &apos;s future prosperity . 
But the Lima conference can do much more than frame a new climate treaty . 
Far from putting the brakes on economic growth , a coordinated legislative campaign should be viewed as an essential prerequisite for sustainable development , especially in Latin America . 
That was a central premise of last month &apos;s flagship report of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate , chaired by former Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n , which made a compelling economic case for combating climate action and reducing climate risk . 
Climate-change legislation also provides a means to reflect the wider concerns of Latin America &apos;s citizens , and to win their support . 
Legislation can send positive signals to the private sector too , including foreign investors , who may be instrumental in bringing about far-reaching change . 
Properly motivated , investors can boost renewable energy ; invest in sustainable urban transport ; encourage innovation ; create jobs in cleaner technologies ; raise productivity ; and help shift the region away from its reliance on finite natural resources . 
The legislative process can also bolster the diplomatic influence of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean at the UN climate talks . 
AILAC , which comprises Chile , Colombia , Costa Rica , Guatemala , Panama , and Peru , can be a critical voice for worldwide cuts in greenhouse-gas emission based on countries &quot; differentiated responsibilities . 
AILAC &apos;s &quot; third way &quot; is gaining traction and could prove instrumental in achieving a global agreement . 
However , if this new approach is to be credible , AILAC &apos;s progressive rhetoric at the UN must be supported by climate action within countries . 
It is vital that governments do not see combating climate change and bolstering economic growth as contradictory goals . 
They do not need to dismantle existing environmental legislation , weaken incipient climate policies , or favor fossil fuels over clean energy sources to ensure prosperity . 
The recent approval of a carbon tax in Chile suggests that politicians increasingly understand this . 
One obvious indicator of progress will be whether governments can simultaneously increase per capita income and reduce per capita emissions . 
As the Lima talks approach , Latin American countries have a huge opportunity to show their commitment to legislative change at home , and to reaching ambitious climate targets globally . 
If the region &apos;s new leaders really wish to show their commitment to change , what better way than to dispel the economic fears surrounding action on climate change ? 
By acting now , they will set their countries - and the wider world - on a new course , giving rise to prosperous , inclusive , and resilient societies this decade and beyond .
