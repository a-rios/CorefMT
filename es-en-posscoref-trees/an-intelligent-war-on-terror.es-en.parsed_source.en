An Intelligent War on Terror 
Terrorism is an existential threat . 
In our European Security Strategy , it was deemed one of the key strategic threats facing the European Union , and to fight it we are using all instruments at our disposal , particularly in the intelligence area . 
The first objective of intelligence is to find terrorists , prevent them from acting , and track them after they do attack . 
This is the kind of operational intelligence that is best done at the national level . 
Many arrests and disruptions of terrorist operations in Europe result from cooperation between EU members &apos; intelligence services . 
I was recently asked by journalists whether inter-agency cooperation is sufficient and whether European mechanisms for sharing operational intelligence should be created . 
Later that very day , a joint operation resulted in simultaneous arrests in five European countries . 
The operation &apos;s success was no accident . 
Last year , the Union concluded two Europol agreements , as well as an Extradition and Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement . 
Europe &apos;s security services are working closely together within the Counter-Terrorist Group , and Europol &apos;s Counter-Terrorist Task Force has been re-established . 
A high-level group on border and transport security is at work , and links between member states &apos; police chiefs are strengthening . 
But widespread sharing is not always needed or appropriate . 
Member states also need intelligence derived from ongoing casework , not to inform policy , at least not directly , but to disrupt and dismantle networks and prevent attacks . 
This information is in many ways more sensitive , and services share it on a &quot; need to know &quot; basis , not for the sake of promoting cooperation . 
I see another role for intelligence : to inform political action . 
Intelligence services can educate the public , explaining the origins of the alienation that underpins terrorism , how radicalization and recruitment occur , and highlight terrorists &apos; goals , methods , and targeting strategies . 
Only when we understand this can we develop appropriate and concrete policies . 
For this we need good strategic assessments of intelligence . 
The EU &apos;s members have structures to provide this , and with their support and input we are building structures at a Europe-wide level , to bring this information to EU policymakers . 
Europol is performing a similar function with material derived from police work , and we are working to ensure synergy between these two efforts . 
This is a different level of intelligence , more analytical , where close collaboration adds significant value . 
In the aftermath of the Madrid bombings , the EU focused on internal aspects of the fight against terrorism . 
On the contrary , the EU regards international cooperation as fundamental in the fight against terrorism . 
Generally , counter-terrorism is very high on our international agenda and is becoming better integrated into the Union &apos;s political dialogue with other countries . 
We are better targeting our external assistance and capacity building programs , and we are ready to use our trade and economic muscle , when necessary , by demanding counter-terrorism clauses in bilateral treaties . 
There has also been a sea change in transatlantic cooperation between the EU and the US . 
Still , I am not complacent . 
To facilitate the extremely complex task of counter-terrorism policymaking in the EU , we now have a Plan of Action , approved by the European Council , which clearly specifies who does what , and by when . 
This will also help national parliaments understand EU objectives and facilitate their legislative planning . 
I have recently appointed a counter-terrorism coordinator to assist me in following through on the Plan of Action . 
We also have a considerable number of new instruments in the area of justice and home affairs . 
The European Arrest Warrant is already producing concrete results , and we are moving towards the &quot; free movement of judicial decisions &quot; in the EU , through which judicial decisions - such as arrest and surrender of suspects , confiscation , and freezing of assets - will be mutually recognized . 
Furthermore , the European Border Agency will become operational in 2005 . 
As requested by the European Council , I am developing , in cooperation with the European Commission , a strategy to shut down terrorist financing . 
This is where the real test of cooperation lies , for our success will rely on securing the appropriate interaction and flow of intelligence between the relevant services and the financial and banking communities . 
I firmly believe that the military option alone cannot defeat terror . 
Judicial , police , and intelligence cooperation should be the focal point for action . 
This does not mean that we are not working on how European Security and Defense Policy ( ESDP ) can offer a meaningful contribution . 
But ESDP is not at the core of our efforts . 
Aside from security and intelligence efforts , we must also work to deny &quot; oxygen &quot; to the terrorists . 
This means addressing the factors that contribute to support for and recruitment by terrorist groups . 
Regional conflicts cause anger and resentment . 
The unresolved Arab-Israeli problem leads to the rise of radicalism and extremism . 
There is entirely too much fuel for terrorist propaganda . 
The EU will be tough on terrorism . 
These are not two fights , but one .
