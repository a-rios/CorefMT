The Inequality Trifecta 
LAGUNA BEACH - There were quite a few disconnects at the recently concluded Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank . 
Among the most striking was the disparity between participants &quot; interest in discussions of inequality and the ongoing lack of a formal action plan for governments to address it . 
This represents a profound failure of policy imagination - one that must urgently be addressed . 
There is good reason for the spike in interest . 
While inequality has decreased across countries , it has increased within them , in the advanced and developing worlds alike . 
The process has been driven by a combination of secular and structural issues - including the changing nature of technological advancement , the rise of &quot; winner-take-all &quot; investment characteristics , and political systems favoring the wealthy - and has been turbocharged by cyclical forces . 
In the developed world , the problem is rooted in unprecedented political polarization , which has impeded comprehensive responses and placed an excessive policy burden on central banks . 
Though monetary authorities enjoy more political autonomy than other policymaking bodies , they lack the needed tools to address effectively the challenges that their countries face . 
In normal times , fiscal policy would support monetary policy , including by playing a redistributive role . 
With political gridlock blocking an appropriate fiscal response - after 2008 , the United States Congress did not pass an annual budget , a basic component of responsible economic governance , for five years - central banks have been forced to bolster economies artificially . 
To do so , they have relied on near-zero interest rates and unconventional measures like quantitative easing to stimulate growth and job creation . 
Beyond being incomplete , this approach implicitly favors the wealthy , who hold a disproportionately large share of financial assets . 
Meanwhile , companies have become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to reduce their tax bills , including through so-called inversions , by which they move their headquarters to lower-tax jurisdictions . 
As a result , most countries face a trio of inequalities - of income , wealth , and opportunity - which , left unchecked , reinforce one another , with far-reaching consequences . 
Indeed , beyond this trio &apos;s moral , social , and political implications lies a serious economic concern : instead of creating incentives for hard work and innovation , inequality begins to undermine economic dynamism , investment , employment , and prosperity . 
Given that affluent households spend a smaller share of their incomes and wealth , greater inequality translates into lower overall consumption , thereby hindering the recovery of economies already burdened by inadequate aggregate demand . 
Today &apos;s high levels of inequality also impede the structural reforms needed to boost productivity , while undermining efforts to address residual pockets of excessive indebtedness . 
This is a dangerous combination that erodes social cohesion , political effectiveness , current GDP growth , and future economic potential . 
That is why it is so disappointing that , despite heightened awareness of inequality , the IMF / World Bank meetings - a gathering of thousands of policymakers , private-sector participants , and journalists , which included seminars on inequality in advanced countries and developing regions alike - failed to make a consequential impact on the policy agenda . 
Policymakers seem convinced that the time is not right for a meaningful initiative to address inequality of income , wealth , and opportunity . 
In fact , a number of steps can and should be taken to stem the rise in inequality . 
In the US , for example , sustained political determination would help to close massive loopholes in estate planning and inheritance , as well as in household and corporate taxation , that disproportionately benefit the wealthy . 
Likewise , there is scope for removing the antiquated practice of taxing hedge and private-equity funds &quot; &quot; carried interest &quot; at a preferential rate . 
The way home ownership is taxed and subsidized could be reformed more significantly , especially at the top price levels . 
To be sure , such measures will make only a dent in inequality , albeit an important and visible one . 
In order to deepen their impact , a more comprehensive macroeconomic policy stance is needed , with the explicit goal of reinvigorating and redesigning structural-reform efforts , boosting aggregate demand , and eliminating debt overhangs . 
Such an approach would reduce the enormous policy burden currently borne by central banks . 
It is time for heightened global attention to inequality to translate into concerted action . 
Some initiatives would tackle inequality directly ; others would defuse some of the forces that drive it . 
Together , they would go a long way toward mitigating a serious impediment to the economic and social wellbeing of current and future generations .
