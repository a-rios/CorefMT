Japan &apos;s Self-Defense Defense 
CAMBRIDGE - Since the end of World War II , Japan has been ruled by an American-written &quot; peace constitution , &quot; Article 9 of which prohibits war and limits Japanese forces to self-defense . 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is now seeking legislation to enable Japan to reinterpret the constitution to include &quot; collective self-defense , &quot; whereby the country would enhance its security cooperation with other countries , particularly its closest ally , the United States . 
Critics view this as a radical departure from seven decades of pacifism . 
But Abe &apos;s central objectives - improving Japan &apos;s ability to respond to threats that do not amount to armed attack ; enabling Japan to participate more effectively in international peacekeeping activities ; and redefining measures for self-defense permitted under Article 9 - are actually relatively modest . 
Fears that the move would lead to Japanese involvement in distant US wars are similarly overblown . 
Indeed , the rules have been carefully crafted to prohibit such adventures , while allowing Japan to work more closely with the US on direct threats to Japanese security . 
It is not difficult to see why Abe is pursuing broader rights to self-defense . 
Japan lies in a dangerous region , in which deep-rooted tensions threaten to erupt at any moment . 
Given that East Asia , unlike Europe after 1945 , never experienced full reconciliation among rivals , or established strong regional institutions , it has been forced to depend on the US-Japan Security Treaty to underpin regional stability . 
When US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration announced its &quot; rebalancing &quot; toward Asia in 2011 , it reaffirmed the 1996 Clinton-Hashimoto Declaration , which cited the US-Japan security alliance as the foundation for stability - a prerequisite for continued economic progress - in Asia . 
That declaration served the larger goal of establishing a stable , albeit uneven , triangular relationship among the US , Japan , and China . 
Subsequent US administrations have upheld this approach , and opinion polls show that it retains broad acceptance in Japan - not least owing to close cooperation on disaster relief following the T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011 . 
But Japan remains extremely vulnerable . 
The most immediate regional threat is North Korea , whose unpredictable dictatorship has invested its meager economic resources in nuclear and missile technology . 
A longer-term concern is the rise of China - an economic and demographic powerhouse whose expanding military capacity has enabled it to take an increasingly assertive stance in territorial disputes , including with Japan in the East China Sea . 
China &apos;s territorial ambitions are also fueling tensions in the South China Sea , where sea-lanes that are vital to Japanese trade are located . 
Complicating matters further is the fact that China &apos;s political evolution has failed to keep pace with its economic progress . 
If the Chinese Communist Party feels threatened by a public frustrated with insufficient political participation and enduring social repression , it could slip into competitive nationalism , upending the already-delicate regional status quo . 
Of course , if China becomes aggressive , Asian countries like India and Australia - which are already disturbed by China &apos;s assertiveness in the South China Sea - will join Japan in the effort to offset China &apos;s power . 
But , as things stand , a strategy of containment would be a mistake . 
After all , the best way to engender enmity is to treat China as an enemy . 
A more effective approach , spearheaded by the US and Japan , would focus on integration , with a hedge against uncertainty . 
American and Japanese leaders must shape the regional environment in such a way that China has incentives to act responsibly , including by maintaining strong defense capabilities . 
Meanwhile , the US and Japan must rethink the structure of their alliance . 
While the expected revisions to Japan &apos;s defense framework are a positive development , many Japanese still resent the lack of symmetry in the alliance obligations . 
Others chafe at the burden of US bases , particularly on the island of Okinawa . 
A longer-term goal should thus be for the US gradually to transfer its bases to Japanese control , leaving American forces to rotate among them . 
In fact , some bases - notably , Misawa Air Base north of Tokyo - already fly Japan &apos;s flag , while hosting American units . 
But the process must be handled carefully . 
As China invests in advanced ballistic missiles , the fixed bases on Okinawa become increasingly vulnerable . 
To avoid the perception that the US decided to turn the bases over to Japan just when their military benefits were diminishing , and to ensure that the move represented America &apos;s recommitment to the alliance , a joint commission would have to be established to manage the transfer . 
For Japan , becoming an equal partner in its alliance with the US is essential to securing its regional and global standing . 
To this end , Abe &apos;s modest step toward collective self-defense is a step in the right direction .
