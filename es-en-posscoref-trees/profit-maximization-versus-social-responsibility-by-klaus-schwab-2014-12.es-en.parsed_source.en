The Profitability of Trust 
GENEVA - The effects of the most devastating financial crisis in decades have begun to fade . 
Indeed , there has been a new wave of heated discussion about whether companies should put profits or the common good first . 
Milton Friedman , a leading proponent of the profit-oriented approach to corporate management , famously declared that &quot; the business of business is business . &quot; 
Indeed , from this standpoint , there is no contradiction between profit maximization and the common good . 
The pursuit of profit itself is a socially beneficial goal . 
A conceptual basis for the opposing perspective , to which I adhere , lies in the Harvard economist Michael Porter &apos;s theory of shared value creation . 
In fact , my own publications promote the stakeholder concept as the framework for a modern understanding of socially responsible corporate management . 
The theoretical debate could continue indefinitely . 
But , in terms of practical company management , such ideological polarization is not particularly useful . 
If managers had to choose between fulfilling the expectations of shareholders and meeting their social and ethical responsibilities , their companies would probably collapse . 
Instead , successful managers recognize that any company is both an economic and social entity , and thus that no stakeholder can be neglected . 
As I wrote more than four decades ago , a company , &quot; like an organism &amp; hellip ; depends on several arteries , &quot; all of which it must nurture if it hopes to survive and grow . 
That sounds straightforward . 
The good news is that , in any such conflict , there is one clear , unifying goal : ensuring the company &apos;s long-term success . 
This requires , first and foremost , that the company is profitable . 
But profitability should not be an end in itself ; it is a tool to help managers determine the most effective use of their resources and gauge the company &apos;s competitiveness and vitality . 
So instead of just paying out dividends , companies should use their profits to bolster their long-term viability . 
Profitability , growth , and safeguards against existential risks are crucial to strengthening a company &apos;s long-term prospects . 
But if these three factors constitute a company &apos;s &quot; hard power , &quot; firms also need &quot; soft power &quot; : public trust and acceptance , won by fulfilling a company &apos;s social responsibility . 
Only when a company has gained the public &apos;s confidence - its &quot; license to operate &quot; - can its management create long-term value for all stakeholders , including shareholders . 
In short , the real conflict is not between profit maximization and social responsibility , but rather between short- and long-term thinking . 
This , in a sense , is an easier conflict to resolve . 
After all , a short-sighted approach not only undermines companies &quot; prospects ; it also threatens the entire economy . 
Indeed , managers &quot; irresponsible focus on advancing shareholders &quot; immediate interests , thereby maximizing their own bonuses , contributed significantly to bringing the global financial system to the brink of collapse in 2008 . 
In order to enable a company &apos;s management to accommodate the long-term interests of all stakeholders , corporate decision-making must account for the four prerequisites of a company &apos;s survival : profitability , growth , risk protection , and public trust . 
Given that satisfying one of these prerequisites often comes at the cost of the others , such a system would entail continuous adjustment and compromise . 
We are emerging from a period when companies , under pressure to meet shareholder expectations , favored profitability and growth , even if it meant taking undue risks and losing public confidence . 
Companies now need to work on minimizing risk and building trust by meeting the legitimate expectations of all their stakeholders , including reducing their activities &quot; adverse impact on the environment and creating high-quality employment opportunities . 
But corporate social responsibility is not limited to how a company does business . 
Firms should use their core competencies to help find solutions to today &apos;s most pressing social problems . 
In other words , beyond serving its own stakeholders , a company should accept its own role as a stakeholder in our collective future - a sort of quid pro quo for its license to operate . 
Fortunately , companies are increasingly acting with a sense of social responsibility . 
By working with governments , international organizations , and civil society , companies are addressing major challenges like social integration , and creating the necessary systems to provide education and health care to those who need it most . 
These companies are implementing the stakeholder concept on a micro and macro level , answering to the demands of their employees , customers , and communities , and thus strengthening their brands . 
In doing so , such companies offer a powerful response to the question of what their role in society should be . 
More important , they are showing the rest of the corporate sector that the business of advancing the common good is a worthy one .
