Africa &apos;s Structural Transformation Challenge 
PRINCETON - Long viewed as an economic basket case , Sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing its best growth performance since the immediate post-independence years . 
Natural-resource windfalls have helped , but the good news extends beyond resource-rich countries . 
Countries such as Ethiopia , Rwanda , and Uganda , among others , have grown at East Asian rates since the mid-1990 &quot; s . 
The question is whether this performance can be sustained . 
So far , growth has been driven by a combination of external resources ( aid , debt relief , or commodity windfalls ) and the removal of some of the worst policy distortions of the past . 
Domestic productivity has been given a boost by an increase in demand for domestic goods and services ( mostly the latter ) and more efficient use of resources . 
The trouble is that it is not clear from whence future productivity gains will come . 
The underlying problem is the weakness of these economies &quot; structural transformation . 
East Asian countries grew rapidly by replicating , in a much shorter time frame , what today &apos;s advanced countries did following the Industrial Revolution . 
They turned their farmers into manufacturing workers , diversified their economies , and exported a range of increasingly sophisticated goods . 
Little of this process is taking place in Africa . 
As researchers at the African Center for Economic Transformation in Accra , Ghana , put it , the continent is &quot; growing rapidly , transforming slowly . &quot; 
In principle , the region &apos;s potential for labor-intensive industrialization is great . 
A Chinese shoe manufacturer , for example , pays its Ethiopian workers one-tenth what it pays its workers back home . 
It can raise Ethiopian workers &quot; productivity to half or more of Chinese levels through in-house training . 
The savings in labor costs more than offset other incremental costs of doing business in an African environment , such as poor infrastructure and bureaucratic red tape . 
But the aggregate numbers tell a worrying story . 
Fewer than 10 % of African workers find jobs in manufacturing , and among those only a tiny fraction - as low as one-tenth - are employed in modern , formal firms with adequate technology . 
Distressingly , there has been very little improvement in this regard , despite high growth rates . 
In fact , Sub-Saharan Africa is less industrialized today than it was in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Private investment in modern industries , especially non-resource tradables , has not increased , and remains too low to sustain structural transformation . 
And yet , as a recent study from the Groningen Growth and Development Center shows , rural migrants do not end up in modern manufacturing industries , as they did in East Asia , but in services such as retail trade and distribution . 
Though such services have higher productivity than much of agriculture , they are not technologically dynamic in Africa and have been falling behind the world frontier . 
Consider Rwanda , a much-heralded success story where GDP has increased by a whopping 9.6 % per year , on average , since 1995 ( with per capita incomes rising at an annual rate of 5.2 % ) . 
Xinshen Diao of the International Food Policy Research Institute has shown that this growth was led by non-tradable services , in particular construction , transport , and hotels and restaurants . 
The public sector dominates investment , and the bulk of public investment is financed by foreign grants . 
Foreign aid has caused the real exchange rate to appreciate , compounding the difficulties faced by manufacturing and other tradables . 
None of this is to dismiss Rwanda &apos;s progress in reducing poverty , which reflects reforms in health , education , and the general policy environment . 
Without question , these improvements have raised the country &apos;s potential income . 
What Rwanda and other African countries lack are the modern , tradable industries that can turn the potential into reality by acting as the domestic engine of productivity growth . 
The African economic landscape &apos;s dominant feature - an informal sector comprising microenterprises , household production , and unofficial activities - is absorbing the growing urban labor force and acting as a social safety net . 
Studies show that very few microenterprises grow beyond informality , just as the bulk of successful established firms do not start out as small , informal enterprises . 
Optimists say that the good news about African structural transformation has not yet shown up in macroeconomic data . 
They may well be right . 
Half of Sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s population is under 25 years of age . 
According to the World Bank , each year an additional five million turn 15 , &quot; crossing the threshold from childhood to adulthood . &quot; 
Given the slow pace of positive structural transformation , the Bank projects that over the next decade only one in four African youth will find regular employment as a salaried worker , and that only a small fraction of those will be in the formal sector of modern enterprises . 
Two decades of economic expansion in Sub-Saharan Africa have raised a young population &apos;s expectations of good jobs without greatly expanding the capacity to deliver them . 
These are the conditions that make social protest and political instability likely . 
Economic planning based on simple extrapolations of recent growth will exacerbate the discrepancy . 
Instead , African political leaders may have to manage expectations downward , while working to increase the rate of structural transformation and social inclusion .
