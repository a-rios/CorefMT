Two Dollar Fallacies 
CAMBRIDGE - The United States &quot; current fiscal and monetary policies are unsustainable . 
The US government &apos;s net debt as a share of GDP has doubled in the past five years , and the ratio is projected to be higher a decade from now , even if the economy has fully recovered and interest rates are in a normal range . 
An aging US population will cause social benefits to rise rapidly , pushing the debt to more than 100 % of GDP and accelerating its rate of increase . 
Although the Federal Reserve and foreign creditors like China are now financing the increase , their willingness to do so is not unlimited . 
Likewise , the Fed &apos;s policy of large-scale asset purchases has increased commercial banks &quot; excess reserves to unprecedented levels ( approaching $ 2 trillion ) , and has driven the real interest rate on ten-year Treasury bonds to an unprecedented negative level . 
As the Fed acknowledges , this will have to stop and be reversed . 
While the future evolution of these imbalances remains unclear , the result could eventually be a sharp rise in long-term interest rates and a substantial fall in the dollar &apos;s value , driven mainly by foreign investors &quot; reluctance to continue expanding their holdings of US debt . 
American investors , fearing an unwinding of the fiscal and monetary positions , might contribute to these changes by seeking to shift their portfolios to assets of other countries . 
While I share these concerns , others frequently rely on two key arguments to dismiss the fear of a run on the dollar : the dollar is a reserve currency , and it carries fewer risks than other currencies . 
Neither argument is persuasive . 
Consider first the claim that the dollar &apos;s status as a reserve currency protects it , because governments around the world need to hold dollars as foreign exchange reserves . 
The problem is that foreign holdings of dollar securities are no longer primarily &quot; foreign exchange reserves &quot; in the traditional sense . 
In earlier decades , countries held dollars because they needed to have a highly liquid and widely accepted currency to bridge the financing gap if their imports exceeded their exports . 
The obvious candidate for this reserve fund was US Treasury bills . 
But , since the late 1990 &quot; s , countries like South Korea , Taiwan , and Singapore have accumulated very large volumes of foreign reserves , reflecting both export-driven growth strategies and a desire to avoid a repeat of the speculative currency attacks that triggered the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis . 
With each of these countries holding more than $ 200 billion in foreign-exchange holdings - and China holding more than $ 3 trillion - these are no longer funds intended to bridge trade-balance shortfalls . 
They are major national assets that must be invested with attention to yield and risk . 
So , although dollar bonds and , increasingly , dollar equities are a large part of these countries &quot; sovereign wealth accounts , most of the dollar securities that they hold are not needed to finance trade imbalances . 
Even if these countries want to continue to hold a minimum core of their portfolios in a form that can be used in the traditional foreign-exchange role , most of their portfolios will respond to their perception of different currencies &quot; risks . 
In short , the US no longer has what Val√©ry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , as France &apos;s finance minister in the 1960 &quot; s , accurately called the &quot; exorbitant privilege &quot; that stemmed from having a reserve currency as its legal tender . 
But some argue that , even if the dollar is not protected by being a reserve currency , it is still safer than other currencies . 
If investors don &apos;t want to hold euros , pounds , or yen , where else can they go ? 
That argument is also false . 
Large portfolio investors don &apos;t put all of their funds in a single currency . 
They diversify their funds among different currencies and different types of financial assets . 
If they perceive that the dollar and dollar bonds have become riskier , they will want to change the distribution of assets in their portfolios . 
So , even if the dollar is still regarded as the safest of assets , the demand for dollars will decline if its relative safety is seen to have declined . 
When that happens , exchange rates and interest rates can change without assets being sold and new assets bought . 
If foreign holders of dollar bonds become concerned that the unsustainability of America &apos;s situation will lead to higher interest rates and a weaker dollar , they will want to sell dollar bonds . 
If that feeling is widespread , the value of the dollar and the price of dollar bonds can both decline without any net change in the holding of these assets . 
The dollar &apos;s real trade-weighted value already is more than 25 % lower than it was a decade ago , notwithstanding the problems in Europe and in other countries . 
And , despite a more competitive exchange rate , the US continues to run a large current-account deficit . 
If progress is not made in reducing the projected fiscal imbalances and limiting the growth of bank reserves , reduced demand for dollar assets could cause the dollar to fall more rapidly and the interest rate on dollar securities to rise .
