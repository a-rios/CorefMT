The Battle for Churchill &apos;s Bust 
NEW YORK - The election of the United States &quot; next president is surely the most important contest in the democratic world . 
Yet the issues being contested can seem awfully trivial . 
Consider , for instance , the question of Winston Churchill &apos;s bust . 
A bronze sculpture of the British prime minister had been in the Oval Office of the White House since the 1960 &quot; s . 
On becoming President , Barack Obama replaced it with a bust of Abraham Lincoln . 
Mitt Romney , his Republican opponent in November &apos;s election , has vowed to restore it if he wins . 
Then a White House spokesman said that the bust was still on the premises , just in a different room , whereupon the story changed once more : there were apparently two busts of Churchill ; one still in the White House , and one that Obama returned to the British embassy . 
Why would anyone care about this ? 
One answer was provided by two of Mitt Romney &apos;s advisers , who stated that their candidate particularly valued the &quot; special relationship &quot; with Britain because of the shared &quot; Anglo-Saxon heritage . &quot; 
This heritage , they claimed , was not sufficiently &quot; appreciated &quot; by the current president . 
When this bizarre statement , with its racist undertones , threatened to become a scandal , Romney quickly distanced himself from it . 
He did not want to be seen as a racist . 
But how else is his peculiar nostalgia for Churchill &apos;s bust to be understood ? 
In fact , the phrase &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; is not often heard any more in the US , where the majority of the population has not been of Anglo-Saxon origin for a long time ( which is also true of Britain &apos;s largest cities ) . 
When Americans use the term , it is usually to differentiate white Americans from the rest , which is not something that most Americans , least of all presidential candidates , would now choose to do in public . 
&quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; is more often used in a negative sense by the French , as in &quot; Anglo-Saxon bankers &quot; or &quot; Anglo-Saxon conspiracies &quot; ( to keep the French down ) . 
Just recently Le Monde had the wonderful headline : &quot; &#91; President &#93; Hollande Defends French Foie Gras against Anglo-Saxon lobbies &quot; ( the reference was to California &apos;s ban on foie gras under its animal-cruelty laws ) . 
Even Churchill himself did not speak of Anglo-Saxons much . 
He talked about &quot; the British race &quot; or the &quot; English-speaking peoples . &quot; 
The so-called &quot; special relationship &quot; between Britain and the US , certainly prized by Churchill , was not so much racial as it was a product of World War II - and a rather complicated one at that . 
During the war , Churchill and Roosevelt shared the idea that once Germany and Japan were defeated , British and US military forces should act as global policemen . 
They believed that the world would be safe from future Hitlers if it were , at least for some time , under the enlightened leadership of the democratic English-speaking peoples . 
By the end of the war , however , Britain was too exhausted to police the world . 
The country was bankrupt and His Majesty &apos;s colonial subjects were growing restive . 
The future belonged to the US and the Soviet Union , neither of which had sentimental feelings about the British Empire , let alone the &quot; Anglo-Saxons . &quot; 
But the British elite , fully aware of their country &apos;s decline , took the &quot; special relationship &quot; with the US very seriously , for it was the only way for Britain to feel like it was still a major power , unlike , say , France . 
They still do . 
Churchill certainly saw it that way , but so did Tony Blair , who presented President George W. Bush with the second Churchill bust . 
Americans , on the whole , have far less interest than the British in the &quot; special relationship . &quot; 
But they are often sentimental about Churchill . 
He is the man whom many American presidents would like to emulate , not because of any racial affinities , but because of his allure as a wartime leader . 
The US is the strongest military power in the world , just as Britain was in Churchill &apos;s youth . 
And , like British empire-builders in the past , US elites often claim a moral mission to remake the world in America &apos;s image . 
Churchill , in other words , became a symbol of presidential hubris in the US , even as the &quot; special relationship &quot; can be viewed as a symbol of British decline . 
People tend to forget that Rudyard Kipling &apos;s famous poem about &quot; the white man &apos;s burden &quot; was not an ode to the British Empire , but to the US colonial enterprise in the Philippines . 
Too much power corrupts , as we all know . 
Hubristic presidents contemplating Churchill &apos;s bust in their office are prone to believe that they have been called upon to be &quot; war presidents &quot; - that they , like Churchill in 1940 , must oppose the next Hitler . 
This siren song drew the US into Vietnam , Afghanistan , and Iraq . 
So , when Obama decided to remove Churchill &apos;s bust from his office in 2008 , this struck me as a very sensible gesture . 
A little less hubris would do the US , as well as the world , some good . 
But now Romney wants him back . 
Whatever else he might be , Romney does not come across as a convincing war leader . 
Businessmen rarely are . 
Yet he likes to portray himself as a tough patriot , and Obama as an un-American wimp . 
Perhaps Romney wants another war , in which he can play Churchill . 
Or perhaps his two advisers were speaking the truth . 
Maybe Romney really is feeling sentimental about the &quot; Anglo-Saxon heritage , &quot; even as Asian power grows . 
If so , nostalgia for Churchill is hardly a sign of American vitality , but more like a romantic rearguard battle , typical of a country in decline .
