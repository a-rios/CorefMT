Putin the Great 
PARIS - One day , monuments to Vladimir Putin may stand in Russian cities , bearing the inscription : &quot; The man who returned Crimea to Mother Russia . &quot; 
But perhaps monuments will be erected on many European squares as well , acclaiming Russia &apos;s president as &quot; The Father of United Europe . &quot; 
Indeed , Putin &apos;s swift move to annex Crimea has done more to harmonize European governments &quot; views on Russia than dozens of bilateral or multilateral meetings . 
In Berlin last week , I heard French and German elites speak with one voice in discussing how to respond to Russia &apos;s aggression in Ukraine . 
Of course , words are not deeds . 
Yet , thanks to Putin , the European Union may have found the new narrative and momentum that it has sought since the fall of the Berlin Wall . 
Europe badly needs that momentum . 
Confronted with a neo-imperial Russia &apos;s desire to revise the post-Cold War order in Europe , the EU must speak with a single voice if it wants to appear strong and credible . 
And it must speak as one with the United States , just as it ( mostly ) did during the Cold War . 
The US , for its part , also seems newly galvanized by the crisis in Ukraine . 
It is as if the Americans &quot; familiarity with their new / old enemy - an adversary whom they understand in a way that they do not understand Afghans , Arabs , or Persians - has provided a renewed sense of purpose . 
The alliance of democracies is back , and the facile quip that America comes from Mars and Europe from Venus no longer makes sense . 
Confronted with a Russia that really does come from Mars and seems to understand and respect only force , the firmness of the world &apos;s democracies must prevail , underpinned by a unity of purpose that was lost in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
As events have taken their course in Ukraine , historical analogies have multiplied . 
According to some , we are in 1914 , on the eve of a world war that few want but that no one can prevent . 
Or we are in 1938 , in the aftermath of Nazi Germany &apos;s annexation of the Sudetenland , confronted with an aggressor who will not be appeased . 
Or we are in 1945 , on the eve of a decades-long cold war . 
We could also be in 1991 , in the midst of Yugoslavia &apos;s implosion , watching a multi-ethnic society divide into warring camps . 
Or we could be in August 2008 , in Georgia , when Putin &apos;s Russia redrew a map by force for the first time . 
All of these analogies contain an element of truth , even if none applies perfectly . 
But to understand Putin &apos;s current attitude and behavior , another analogy is probably more important : the 1853-56 Crimean War , in which more than 800,000 people died , including 250,000 Russians . 
The pretext for the war , which pitted the Russians , under Czar Nicholas I , against the British , French , and Ottomans , was Russia &apos;s self-declared responsibility to protect Jerusalem &apos;s holy places . 
Nicholas &apos;s reign combined imperial ambition and religious fervor ( directed against both the Ottoman Empire and the Catholic Church ) , and Russia &apos;s defeat was glorious . 
During the long siege of Sevastopol , more than 120,000 Russian soldiers lost their lives . 
Leo Tolstoy , who took part in the war , found in it a source of inspiration for his novel War and Peace . 
Putin used to present himself as the political heir of Peter the Great . 
He may instead be remembered as a new Nicholas I ( whose portrait hangs in his office ) : an ultra-conservative czar who was in power too long and lost touch with reality . 
Combining nationalism , orthodoxy , and the mental habits of his KGB years , Putin constitutes an explosive mixture that must be handled with care , but above all with firmness . 
This implies the need to stand behind Ukraine both politically and economically . 
The general election on May 25 must not only take place as planned , but must do so under the best possible conditions , even as Putin does his utmost to derail them . 
Preventing that outcome requires containing Ukraine &apos;s small but loud far-right parties , whose anti-Russian chauvinism makes them Putin &apos;s closest ally in escalating the conflict . 
Sanctions against Russia , such as its ejection from the G-8 , or against Putin &apos;s closest allies will not suffice . 
The goal should be to convince Putin that Europe ( including Italy and Germany ) has alternatives to its gas and oil : Nigeria and Brazil , for example , not to mention the possibility of US shale energy . 
Indeed , Putin may have given Europe an unexpected opportunity to create , at long last , a common energy policy , one that would be more rational and much less costly in the long run . 
Of course , the far-reaching reappraisal of international relations that now confronts Europe ( the rest of the world &apos;s democracies ) will have a cost . 
Sacrifices will have to be made . 
But in this game of attrition , despotic Russia has more to lose than democratic Europe . 
One thing is certain : Putin did not stop with Georgia , and he will not stop with Crimea . 
Unless the limits to his ambitions are set now , the scariest historical analogies will become the most accurate .
