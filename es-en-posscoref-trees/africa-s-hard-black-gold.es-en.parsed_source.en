Africa &apos;s Hard Black Gold 
LAGOS - Few infrastructure services in the developed world may be as taken for granted as electric power . 
To consumers in industrialized countries , uninterrupted power supply is a given . 
Not so in much of Africa , which experiences some of the world &apos;s greatest power deficits , and where only two in ten people have access to electricity . 
According to the International Monetary Fund &apos;s most recent Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa , in 2007 alone , nearly two-thirds of the countries in the region experienced an acute energy crisis marked by frequent and extended electricity outages . 
There is no shortage of hydropower plants for electricity generation in Africa . 
However , many of these plants are unable to keep up with rapid population growth and attendant increases in demand . 
Furthermore , they are prone to frequent drought , which reduces their output significantly , leaving many as little more than decorative infrastructure landmarks . 
Increasingly burgeoning populations in countries like Nigeria and Ghana imply a greater extraction of water resources for power generation . 
Rapid expansion of agricultural activity is requiring more and more water all across the continent . 
Other resources like fuel oil , diesel , light crude , solar , and gas are also available as means of electricity generation , but their costs are all quite prohibitive . 
These factors make a good argument for coal as a cheap alternative source of Africa &apos;s power . 
Coal has historically played a crucial role as a source of energy worldwide , and has several important advantages over other fossil fuels . First is its relative abundance . 
The current level of proven coal reserves worldwide stands at roughly 850 billion tons . 
Africa has about 50 billion tons . 
Coal is also much more widely distributed geographically than any other fossil fuel . 
Worldwide energy demand has increased by more than 50 % since 1980 , and is expected to grow annually by 1.6 % between now and 2030 . 
More than 70 % of this new demand will come from developing countries , with fossil fuels projected to account for about 80 % of total energy demand by the end of this period . 
Coal is the world &apos;s fastest growing fossil fuel , with annual production increasing by 6.4 % since 2004 . 
It is already the dominant source of power generation in some very important energy-consuming nations . 
Much of the future increases in coal-fired electricity generation will come from strategically important developing countries like China and India . 
In 2006 alone , China added about 93,000 megawatts of coal- fired electricity generating capacity , and this trend is expected to continue as the country tries to meet its huge energy needs . 
Even in many developed countries , coal still accounts for a large share of power generation . 
Coal plants currently provide more than half of America &apos;s electricity supply . 
Denmark , which houses some of the most efficient coal-fired power plants in the world , equally relies on coal for half of its electricity production . 
The same is true for Germany , which is home to some of the most efficient pulverized coal combustion units in Europe . 
Poland uses coal for 98 % of its electricity production , and South Africa uses coal for about 50 % of its electricity production . 
Against this picture then , it is hard not to expect developing countries to exploit their abundant coal resources to generate power for their own development , especially given that modern technology can help produce coal cleanly . 
Some argue that gas might be a better alternative to hydro or coal , but for countries that must import much of their gas the benefits of a stable and reliable source of cheap fuel in the form of coal present a very strong counter-argument to the capital costs of a gas plant . 
Unlike prices for coal , which is abundant and dispersed geographically , gas prices are subject to significant volatility , and the long-term trend in the face of fossil fuel depletion is uncertain . 
In contrast , coal prices are more stable , and may remain that way for a long time . 
Apart from electric-power generation , coal also has wide application in a number of industries . 
It is pivotal in both steel and cement production . 
Moreover , the use of wood by Africa &apos;s growing population is causing increasingly rapid deforestation in many countries . 
There is significant potential domestic demand for coal briquettes to replace wood for cooking and domestic and industrial heating . 
Clearly , there are environmental drawbacks from the use of coal as an energy resource , and these concerns are far too important to overlook . 
The massive reserves notwithstanding , coal is still a finite resource . 
It must be mined with greater efficiency and with a view to mitigating the environmental impact . 
Fortunately , much greater attention is paid today to mine safety and the management of the by-products of coal use . 
With acid rain and other public-health hazards linked to coal combustion , more technologies are emerging for reducing harmful emissions from power plants . 
Fueled by research , the past few years have witnessed the development of increasingly cleaner and more energy-efficient coal-fired generation plants and the retirement of older technologies , especially in the developed world . 
Developing countries have lagged behind in this process , but , with the common threat of global warming , there is now growing pressure to adopt conservation policies . 
Africa &apos;s mineral-rich countries must exploit their abundant natural resources . 
They must use coal to advance their economic development . 
Failure to do so would be a missed opportunity at a time when African countries must avail themselves of all available resources for poverty reduction .
