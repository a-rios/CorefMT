How Independent Is The ECB ? 
As the European Union prepares to welcome up to twelve new members , debate is heating up among the leading candidate countries about whether or not speedy adoption of the euro will promote or impede rapid catch-up growth . 
But expanding the reach of monetary union raises two equally fundamental questions for current euro members : does formal political independence for the European Central Bank deliver truly independent judgements about policy ? 
If not , will expansion aggravate the problem because the biases of ECB members will become even more divergent than they are today ? 
Each new entrant into Europe &apos;s monetary union adds one member to the ECB &apos;s Governing Council , the group that sets the euro area &apos;s monetary policy . 
With 18 members , the Governing Council is already larger than the governing bodies of the US Federal Reserve Board , the Bank of England , or the Bank of Japan . 
To reduce the risks of unwieldiness , the ECB needs to reform its Governing Council now . 
While the Nice Treaty does not permit re-structuring the Governing Council , it does allow for change in the voting rule that the Council uses . 
A rule that requires a rotation of votes among Council members , or that groups them into voting blocs , could replace the current one-man-one-vote scheme . 
How would such a change affect European monetary policy ? 
Enlargement of monetary union will increase the relative number of national central bank chiefs on the Governing Council . 
Each entrant will add one member , while the number of officials from the ECB &apos;s headquarters in Frankfurt will remain fixed at six . 
Some observers suggest that this shift will make European monetary policy more prone to the regional biases of national central banks . 
But it may be a mistake to assume that central bankers in Frankfurt lack regional or national bias . 
I examined the question of regional bias in the US Federal Reserve , whose monetary policy body , the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , is composed of seven officials from Washington and five from regional offices . 
I analyzed records from 1978 through 2000 , which included 214 meetings and conference calls , with more than 2,400 votes by FOMC members . 
America &apos;s Fed policymakers are more likely to dissent in favor of lower interest rates when their region &apos;s unemployment rate is higher than the national average . 
They are also more likely to dissent in favor of raising rates when their region &apos;s unemployment rate is below the national average . 
So officials in Washington seem to be more , not less , sensitive to regional unemployment than officials in regional Fed offices ! 
Is the same thing true of the ECB ? 
To find out , an identical analysis of its policy deliberations would be needed , but the absence of recorded and published votes makes this impossible . 
I devised an experiment that allows us to look at whether national loyalties played a role in ECB policy since the euro &apos;s inception . 
This experiment assumed that each member of the ECB &apos;s Governing Council casts votes on the basis of the difference between his country &apos;s inflation rate and the average inflation rate in the euro area during the previous month . 
It also assumed that if the difference between the national inflation rate and the euro-area average exceeded a certain threshold in the month prior to a monetary policy meeting , the Governing Council member would vote in a particular fashion . 
For example , if national inflation were higher than euro-area inflation by more than a particular amount ( the threshold value ) , then a Council member from that country would vote in favor of monetary tightening or against monetary easing . 
If it were lower than the euro-area average by more than the threshold value , then he or she would vote against monetary tightening or in favor of monetary easing . 
Finally , I assumed that all policy decisions were made on the basis of a simple majority vote . 
I analysed the eleven instances in which the ECB changed interest rates from January 1999 through December 2001 . 
Taking into account the national identities of each Governing Council member , I calculated the total number of members who would have voted contrary to the actual monetary policy change that was made , given the assumptions about differences between national and euro-zone inflation rates . 
I then repeated the experiment using various threshold values . 
The results indicate that the ECB &apos;s monetary policy decisions are consistent with the regional bias hypothesis . 
In nearly every case and for every threshold value tested , a majority of Governing Council members voted for the policy change that actually occurred , and their votes could be predicted by the difference between their national inflation rate and the euro-area average . 
One proposal for voting reform on the Governing Council gives greater weight to the six policymakers at the ECB &apos;s center , under the assumption that these officials are less likely to be swayed by national interests . 
But my experiment indicates that even when voting is limited to these six officials , the policy decisions taken between January 1999 and December 2001 are consistent with outcomes based on differences in regional inflation . 
Two serious conclusions follow from all this : first , any change to the voting rules of the ECB &apos;s Governing Council should minimize the potential for regional bias , which can only grow with expansion eastward . 
Second , reformers should not presume that officials at the ECB &apos;s Frankfurt headquarters are less likely to show bias than officials from national central banks .
