Deaths of the Poor and Responsibilities of the Rich 
In a shocking book of last year entitled &quot; Late Victorian Holocausts , &quot; Mike Davis described the British Empire &apos;s attitude to famines in India and elsewhere . 
When monsoons failed , millions of Indians faced imminent death . 
Food could have been transported by rail within British India to save many starving people , but the British believed in a hands-off , laissez faire policy . 
Starvation was part of nature . 
Actually , British attitudes were even more shocking . 
British officers believed that they were being brave by not being swayed by &quot; emotions &quot; ! 
They congratulated themselves on their stiff upper lips . 
Unbelievable nowadays ? 
No , for the US is doing something similar . 
America has idly stood by as millions of Africans die of AIDS . 
Recently , the US Treasury Secretary and Health Secretary visited Africa and looked dying people in the eye . 
Such people are dying not because early death is inevitable , but because they cannot afford the medicines to keep themselves alive . 
If every American gave $ 10 per year to this cause , over 1 million Africans could be saved from AIDS death each year , with money left over to fight the disease . 
As recent studies show , if the 1 billion people in the rich world gave $ 10 per year , the resulting total of $ 10 billion could finance a serious battle against AIDS , TB , and malaria . 
The new Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB , and Malaria was started this year , but rich countries contributed less than one-tenth of the money it needs . 
In its first months of operation the Fund committed all of the money that it received from rich countries . 
Neither the US nor Europe has stepped forward with more money . 
Every excuse is made to avoid giving what is needed . 
Senior US officials continue to say that there is no infrastructure to dispense medicines , even as these officials visit hospitals that possess the necessary doctors , clinics , nurses , and pharmacies . 
As doctors patiently explain , what they are missing is medicine , because they lack the money to buy needed drugs . 
When US Treasury Secretary Paul O &apos;Neill visited an AIDS clinic in Soweto , South Africa , doctors told him that they could increase by ten times the number of people treated with AIDS drugs if sufficient money was available . 
Twenty-two years into the AIDS pandemic the Bush Administration insists that it won &apos;t let emotion push it into action . 
We need a plan , says the US ; we cannot throw money at the problem . 
As in the late 19 th century , we have the spectacle of the world &apos;s superpower treating indifference as a sign of seriousness ! 
The truth is simpler . 
Africans barely count in American politics . 
Africans don &apos;t vote ; they don &apos;t buy US products ; they don &apos;t threaten violence . 
They are simply poor , hungry , and disease-ridden . 
Few rich countries do better than the US . 
I single out America not because it is unique in its neglect , but because it is unique in its capacity to lead . 
Europe and Japan have also avoided the financial contributions to AIDS control that could keep millions of HIV-infected Africans alive . 
In coming months , rich countries will face three opportunities to mend their ways . 
In early June , the UN &apos;s Food and Agriculture Organization will host the World Food Summit . 
With nearly 900 million chronically hungry people around the globe , the Summit presents an opportunity to reverse the collapse of financial assistance for food production to poor countries . 
As with AIDS , a few dollars per person of assistance for agriculture each year could spare millions from hunger . 
Later in June , rich countries will hold their annual G-7 Summit . 
They have promised to make Africa its centerpiece . 
More money for Africa rather than more soothing words will be the true test of the summit . 
In August , political leaders from the entire world will gather in Johannesburg for the World Summit on Sustainable Development . 
Rich countries will once again have a chance to be true partners of the poor . 
The rich may feel that clever words will absolve them of responsibility , but the hungry and dying stand witness to the tragic realities .
