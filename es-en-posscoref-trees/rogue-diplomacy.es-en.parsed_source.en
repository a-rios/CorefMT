Rogue Diplomacy 
NEW DELHI - &quot; Such very fine brains &quot; filled with &quot; such bad ideas . &quot; 
That was how the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan , a former United States senator and perhaps the keenest mind to enter US politics since World War II , once described India , where he was US ambassador in the 1970 &quot; s . 
That snappy description of my country is also a very good way to describe the current - and seemingly unending - contretemps between the leaders of Iran and the US . 
As a new round of negotiations with Iran begins - with European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton the first into the breach - finding a way to move Iran-US relations beyond their freighted past is an urgent matter . 
In both countries , deep and mutually paralyzing suspicion has poisoned relations for three decades . 
Negotiations in such an atmosphere are almost fated to failure . 
America &apos;s acceptance of Iran &apos;s current regime is grudging . 
Iranian leaders demonize the US as if the millions killed in the 1980 &quot; s in the Iran-Iraq War ( in which the US backed Saddam Hussein &apos;s invading army ) died only yesterday . 
So long as these dark shadows are allowed to linger , &quot; resetting &quot; relations between the two countries , in the manner of US-Russia relations , will be impossible . 
The list of disputes between the two countries is almost endless , but Iran &apos;s plan to enrich uranium now stands above everything else . 
The Iranians insist that they need nuclear power to generate electricity . 
Their secretiveness , maintains the US , betrays the regime &apos;s drive to develop nuclear weapons . 
Not surprisingly , given the Americans &quot; deeply ingrained suspicion , the agreement reached earlier this year between Iran and Turkey and Brazil to allow for the export of low-enriched uranium from Iran in return for fuel rods was &quot; not acceptable &quot; to the US . 
So what does the US want ? 
&quot; Crippling sanctions , &quot; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton once said , though she quickly retracted that impromptu remark . 
But no such caution restrains US senators like South Carolina &apos;s Lindsey Graham , who says that the &quot; evil ( of ) a nuclear ... Iran &quot; will affect the US &quot; far more than ( any ) conflict . &quot; 
Following the hopeful early months of the Obama administration , this &quot; stop Iran &quot; policy has become America &apos;s focus . 
Iran , of course , repeatedly asserts its commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , but its past relations with Dr. A. Q. Khan - the self-proclaimed &quot; godfather &quot; of Pakistan &apos;s nuclear-weapons program , and the world &apos;s most notorious nuclear proliferator - invites skepticism . 
Indeed , the US holds the &quot; Khan network &quot; responsible for helping Iran start its own nuclear program . 
Mistrust is compounded by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s incendiary pronouncements , particularly about Israel . 
Although the origins of Iran &apos;s nuclear program are to be found in the &quot; enlightened &quot; presidency of Mohammad Khatami ( 1997-2005 ) - it was just before Ahmadinejad &apos;s inauguration that Iran ended its self-imposed moratorium on uranium enrichment - Ahmadinejad &apos;s bombast has made matters worse . 
And not just with the US . 
In September 2005 , the International Atomic Energy Agency deemed Iran &quot; non-compliant &quot; with the NPT . 
Between 2006 and 2008 , Iran was subjected to three United Nations Security Council resolutions , each imposing yet more sanctions . 
Yet , despite increasing economic costs , Iran &apos;s response only hardened . 
Iran &apos;s insecurity goes back at least to 1953 , when US and British officials plotted the military coup that removed from office Mohammed Mossadegh , Iran &apos;s first elected prime minister and an ardent nationalist , and installed General Fazlollah Zahedi . 
Mossadegh &apos;s sin was his plan to nationalize Iran &apos;s oil industry . 
But , in the process of laying claim to Iran &apos;s oil , subverting its democracy , and jeopardizing its national security , the US and Britain committed a much graver sin : the wounding of Iranians &quot; national pride . 
Then there is the Shah &apos;s ouster , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini &apos;s Islamic Revolution , the absurd abduction of US diplomats , President Jimmy Carter &apos;s disastrous attempt to free them militarily , and the &quot; Iran-Contra &quot; scandal , when Reagan administration officials sought to sell weapons to Iran through third parties and channel the proceeds to anti-Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua . 
Iran sits at the heart of an extremely volatile region . 
The country &apos;s Shia footprint stretches from the Mediterranean to the Hindu Kush . 
It has a vital role in Afghanistan ; indeed , it was passively supportive of the removal of the Taliban from power in 2001 . 
With such a country , &quot; non-engagement &quot; means having no policy at all . 
America &apos;s failure to talk to Iran is as foolhardy as its decades-long failure to talk with Mao &apos;s China . 
Even if Iranian nuclear weapons are not acceptable to the US , President Barack Obama needs to start talking more openly about what is . 
His Nobel Peace Prize demands it . 
And talking should not be impossible . 
As India &apos;s foreign minister , I engaged in successful talks with Iran frequently . 
Iran may be a self-proclaimed theocracy , but it has conducted foreign relations since the 1979 revolution in a rational , if not always emollient , way . 
Ahmadinejad may bluster , but there is usually considerable ambiguity and calculation behind his outbursts . 
Iran is obstinate , prideful , ambitious , and , yes , sometimes paranoid . 
A young population with no memory of the Islamic Revolution is desperate for the jobs that its leaders have failed to provide . 
In these circumstances , if Iran is offered a diplomatic ladder that it can climb down with its dignity intact - above all , a credible promise of an historic reconciliation with the US that includes specific economic benefits , not Obama &apos;s current vague offers - a tired revolution &apos;s troubled leadership might take it . 
That , not Western bluster and sanctions , is the way ahead .
