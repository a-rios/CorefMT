The Great Depression in Economic Memory 
PARIS - The dispute that has emerged in the United States and Europe between proponents of further government stimulus and advocates of fiscal retrenchment feels very much like a debate about economic history . 
Both sides have revisited the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s - as well as the centuries-long history of sovereign-debt crises - in a controversy that bears little resemblance to conventional economic-policy controversies . 
The pro-stimulus camp often refers to the damage wrought by fiscal retrenchment in the US in 1937 , four years after Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s election as US president and the launch of the New Deal . 
According to computations by the economist Paul van den Noord , the net result of the 1937 budget was a fiscal contraction amounting to three percentage points of GDP - certainly not a trivial amount . 
Economic growth plummeted from 13 % in 1936 to 6 % in 1937 , and GDP shrank 4.5 % in 1938 , while unemployment rose from 14 % to roughly 20 % . 
Although fiscal policy was not the only cause of the double dip , ill-timed retrenchment certainly contributed to it . 
So , are we in 1936 , and does the budgetary tightening contemplated in many countries risk provoking a similar double-dip recession ? 
Clearly there are limits to the comparison . 
For starters , much less time has elapsed since the financial crisis , the recession has been much shallower , and recovery has come faster . 
Moreover , important developments that occurred between the 1929 stock-market crisis and the 1937 fiscal retrenchment - especially America &apos;s turn to protectionism in 1930 and the monetary turmoil of subsequent years - have no analog today . 
Nevertheless , the 1937 episode does seem to illustrate the dangers of attempting to consolidate public finances at a time when the private sector is still too weak for economic recovery to be self-sustaining . 
( Another case with similar consequences was Japan &apos;s value-added tax increase in 1997 , which precipitated a collapse of consumption ) . 
Fiscal hawks also rely on history-based arguments . 
The economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have studied centuries of sovereign-debt crises , and remind us that today &apos;s developed world has a forgotten history of sovereign default . 
A particularly telling example is the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars of the early nineteenth century , when a string of exhausted states defaulted on their obligations . 
The 1930 &quot; s are relevant here as well , given another series of defaults among European states , not least Germany . 
What history tells us here is that defaults are not the privilege of poor , under-governed countries . 
They are a threat to all , especially in times of high capital mobility , when governments rely too much on foreign lenders &quot; apparent willingness to provide funds and find themselves in dire straits when capital inflows stop . 
Again , there are limits to comparisons : it is especially hard to infer from past episodes the limits to public debt . 
After all , British public debt exceeded 250 % of GDP in the aftermath of World War II , and Britain did not default . 
This was the case under the gold-based monetary regimes such as the Gold Standard of the nineteenth century , and it is the case today for countries that have relinquished their monetary autonomy , such as the members of the eurozone . 
In normal times , history is left to historians and economic-policy debate relies on models and econometric estimates . 
Indeed , central bankers and ministers were obsessed at the time by the memory of the 1930 &quot; s , and they consciously did the opposite of what their predecessors did 80 years ago . 
They were right to do so . 
In extraordinary times , history is , in fact , a better guide than models estimated with data from ordinary times , because it captures variance that standard time-series techniques ignore . 
If one wants to know how to deal with a banking crisis , the risk of a depression , or the threat of a default , it is natural to examine times when those dangers were around , rather than to rely on models that ignore such dangers or treat them as distant clouds . 
In times of crisis , the best guides are theory , which captures the essence of a problem , and the lessons of past experience . 
Everything in between is virtually useless . 
The danger with relying on history , however , is that we have no methodology to decide which comparisons are relevant . 
Loose analogies can easily be regarded at proofs , and a vast array of experiences can be enrolled to support a particular view . 
Policymakers ( whose knowledge of economic history is generally limited ) are therefore at risk of being drowned in contradictory historical references . 
History can be an essential compass when past experience provides unambiguous headings . 
Governance by analogy can easily lead to muddled governance .
