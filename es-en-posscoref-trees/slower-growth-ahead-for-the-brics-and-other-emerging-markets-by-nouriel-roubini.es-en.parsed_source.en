Trouble in Emerging-Market Paradise 
NEW YORK - During the last few years , a lot of hype has been heaped on the BRICS ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) . 
With their large populations and rapid growth , these countries , so the argument goes , will soon become some of the largest economies in the world - and , in the case of China , the largest of all by as early as 2020 . 
But the BRICS , as well as many other emerging-market economies - have recently experienced a sharp economic slowdown . 
So , is the honeymoon over ? 
Brazil &apos;s GDP grew by only 1 % last year , and may not grow by more than 2 % this year , with its potential growth barely above 3 % . 
Russia &apos;s economy may grow by barely 2 % this year , with potential growth also at around 3 % , despite oil prices being around $ 100 a barrel . 
India had a couple of years of strong growth recently ( 11.2 % in 2010 and 7.7 % in 2011 ) but slowed to 4 % in 2012 . 
China &apos;s economy grew by 10 % per year for the last three decades , but slowed to 7.8 % last year and risks a hard landing . 
And South Africa grew by only 2.5 % last year and may not grow faster than 2 % this year . 
Many other previously fast-growing emerging-market economies - for example , Turkey , Argentina , Poland , Hungary , and many in Central and Eastern Europe - are experiencing a similar slowdown . 
So , what is ailing the BRICS and other emerging markets ? 
First , most emerging-market economies were overheating in 2010-2011 , with growth above potential and inflation rising and exceeding targets . 
Many of them thus tightened monetary policy in 2011 , with consequences for growth in 2012 that have carried over into this year . 
Second , the idea that emerging-market economies could fully decouple from economic weakness in advanced economies was far-fetched : recession in the eurozone , near-recession in the United Kingdom and Japan in 2011-2012 , and slow economic growth in the United States were always likely to affect emerging-market performance negatively - via trade , financial links , and investor confidence . 
For example , the ongoing eurozone downturn has hurt Turkey and emerging-market economies in Central and Eastern Europe , owing to trade links . 
Third , most BRICS and a few other emerging markets have moved toward a variant of state capitalism . 
This implies a slowdown in reforms that increase the private sector &apos;s productivity and economic share , together with a greater economic role for state-owned enterprises ( and for state-owned banks in the allocation of credit and savings ) , as well as resource nationalism , trade protectionism , import-substitution industrialization policies , and imposition of capital controls . 
This approach may have worked at earlier stages of development and when the global financial crisis caused private spending to fall ; but it is now distorting economic activity and depressing potential growth . 
Indeed , China &apos;s slowdown reflects an economic model that is , as former Premier Wen Jiabao put it , &quot; unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and unsustainable , &quot; and that now is adversely affecting growth in emerging Asia and in commodity-exporting emerging markets from Asia to Latin America and Africa . 
The risk that China will experience a hard landing in the next two years may further hurt many emerging economies . 
Fourth , the commodity super-cycle that helped Brazil , Russia , South Africa , and many other commodity-exporting emerging markets may be over . 
Indeed , a boom would be difficult to sustain , given China &apos;s slowdown , higher investment in energy-saving technologies , less emphasis on capital- and resource-oriented growth models around the world , and the delayed increase in supply that high prices induced . 
The fifth , and most recent , factor is the US Federal Reserve &apos;s signals that it might end its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected , and its hints of an eventual exit from zero interest rates , both of which have caused turbulence in emerging economies &quot; financial markets . 
Even before the Fed &apos;s signals , emerging-market equities and commodities had underperformed this year , owing to China &apos;s slowdown . 
Since then , emerging-market currencies and fixed-income securities ( government and corporate bonds ) have taken a hit . 
The era of cheap or zero-interest money that led to a wall of liquidity chasing high yields and assets - equities , bonds , currencies , and commodities - in emerging markets is drawing to a close . 
Finally , while many emerging-market economies tend to run current-account surpluses , a growing number of them - including Turkey , South Africa , Brazil , and India - are running deficits . 
And these deficits are now being financed in riskier ways : more debt than equity ; more short-term debt than long-term debt ; more foreign-currency debt than local-currency debt ; and more financing from fickle cross-border interbank flows . 
These countries share other weaknesses as well : excessive fiscal deficits , above-target inflation , and stability risk ( reflected not only in the recent political turmoil in Brazil and Turkey , but also in South Africa &apos;s labor strife and India &apos;s political and electoral uncertainties ) . 
The need to finance the external deficit and to avoid excessive depreciation ( and even higher inflation ) calls for raising policy rates or keeping them on hold at high levels . 
But monetary tightening would weaken already-slow growth . 
Thus , emerging economies with large twin deficits and other macroeconomic fragilities may experience further downward pressure on their financial markets and growth rates . 
These factors explain why growth in most BRICS and many other emerging markets has slowed sharply . 
Some factors are cyclical , but others - state capitalism , the risk of a hard landing in China , the end of the commodity super-cycle - are more structural . 
Thus , many emerging markets &quot; growth rates in the next decade may be lower than in the last - as may the outsize returns that investors realized from these economies &quot; financial assets ( currencies , equities , bonds , and commodities ) . 
Of course , some of the better-managed emerging-market economies will continue to experience rapid growth and asset outperformance . 
But many of the BRICS , along with some other emerging economies , may hit a thick wall , with growth and financial markets taking a serious beating .
