The Green Pseudo-Revolution 
COPENHAGEN - With a worldwide recession advancing , strong action on global warming has been thrown into jeopardy . 
This matters , because in little more than a year , the world will sit down in Copenhagen to negotiate the follow-on treaty to the failed Kyoto Protocol . 
Yet , with people losing jobs and income , immediate economic help seems to matter more than temperature differentials 100 years from now . 
Many green pundits have , however , started saying that the financial crisis only makes the need for action on climate change greater . 
They urge America &apos;s president-elect Barack Obama to pursue a &quot; green revolution &quot; with big investments in renewable energy , arguing that this could create millions of new &quot; green collar &quot; jobs and open huge new markets . 
Such sentiments , no surprise , are strongly voiced by business leaders who live off such subsidies . 
But are such pleas smart investments for society ? 
The problem with the green revolution argument is that it doesn &apos;t trouble itself about efficiency . 
It is most often lauded for supplying new jobs . 
But billions of dollars in tax subsidies would create plenty of new jobs in almost any sector : the point is that many less capital-intensive sectors would create many more jobs for a given investment of taxpayers &quot; money . 
Similarly , green initiatives will open new markets only if other nations subsidize inefficient technologies bought abroad . 
Thus , the real game becomes which nations get to suck up other nations &quot; tax-financed subsidies . 
Apart from the resulting global inefficiency , this also creates a whole new raft of industry players that will keep pushing inefficient legislation , simply because it fills their coffers . 
A good illustration is Denmark , which early on provided huge subsidies for wind power , building thousands of inefficient turbines around the country from the 1980 &quot; s onwards . 
Today , it is often remarked that Denmark is providing every third terrestrial wind turbine in the world , creating billions in income and jobs . 
A few years ago , however , the Danish Economic Council conducted a full evaluation of the wind turbine industry , taking into account not only its beneficial effects on jobs and production , but also the subsidies that it receives . 
The net effect for Denmark was found to be a small cost , not benefit . 
Not surprisingly , the leading Danish wind producer is today urging strong action on climate change that would imply even more sales of wind turbines . 
The company sponsors the &quot; Planet in Peril &quot; show on CNN , which helps galvanize public pressure for action . 
The crucial point is that many green technologies are not cost-effective , at least not yet . 
If they were , we wouldn &apos;t need to subsidize them . 
The standard reply is that green technologies seem more expensive only because the price of fossil fuels does not reflect their climate costs . 
That makes some sense . 
Given that fossil fuels contribute to global warming , standard economic theory suggests we should tax them according to their cumulative negative effects . 
But this would make little difference to the inefficiency of most green technologies . 
The most comprehensive economic meta-study shows that total future climate impacts justify a tax of â‚¬ 0.012 per liter of petrol ( $ 0.06 per gallon in the US . ) 
This is dwarfed by the tax that many European countries already impose , and it is much less than in the European trading system . 
Yet it is argued that much higher taxes and subsidies are the best way to increase research and development in new , cheaper renewable energy sources . 
This is untrue . 
During the massive investment associated with the Kyoto treaty , the participating countries &quot; investment in R D as a percentage of GDP has declined , not increased . 
It is rather obvious that if you invest massively in inefficient solar panels , most of your money will go to buy the physical panels , whereas only a very small part will go to R D. If you want more R D , you should spend your money directly on R D. This could tackle global warming in the longer run . 
Finally , it is often claimed that high CO2 taxes and subsidies for green technology will actually do good , and again Denmark is often taken as an example . 
After all , it is argued , Denmark has kept its CO2 emissions flat while enjoying 70 % economic growth since 1981 . 
But could it have grown more if it had not restricted CO2 emissions ? 
During the same period , US emissions grew 29 % , but its GDP grew 39 % more than Denmark &apos;s , indicating a simple truth : CO2 cuts and subsidies don &apos;t necessarily mean no growth , but they probably do mean slower growth . 
President-elect Obama is now facing countless people who claim that subsidies for renewable energy and CO2 taxes are great ways to tackle global warming and forge a new green economy . 
Unfortunately , this is almost entirely incorrect . 
Taxes and subsidies are always expensive , and will likely impede growth . 
Moreover , if we really want to tackle global warming , we shouldn &apos;t spend vast sums of money buying inefficient green technology - we should invest directly in R D to make future green technology competitive . 
Obama should seize the initiative and make the meeting in Copenhagen next year not about bloated subsidies for inefficient technologies , but about lean investments in future breakthroughs . 
That is the way to tackle global warming and support a genuinely vibrant economy .
