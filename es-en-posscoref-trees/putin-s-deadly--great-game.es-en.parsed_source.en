Putin &apos;s Deadly &quot; Great Game &quot; 
President Vladimir Putin will visit Ukraine , the scene of his biggest foreign policy blunder , this weekend . 
Given his myopic actions at home , where he seems increasingly incapable of dealing with any institution that has any degree of autonomy , this seems unlikely . 
For example , Putin recently abolished elections in Russia &apos;s provinces . 
From now on , presidential appointees will rule a country that is as complex and multi-national as the EU or the US . 
Indeed , elected officials in Russia have become an endangered species . 
The Kremlin black art of manipulating elections by deception and other means - called &quot; political technology &quot; by locals - will now be used only in other countries &quot; elections in , as these are the only real elections the Kremlin has to worry about , so neutered have Russia &apos;s own votes become . 
The justification for canceling elections in Russia is the need to fight terrorism - the end that now justifies all means . 
How did it happen that every contemporary problem , particularly in Russia , seems to have been reduced to terrorist attacks and counter-terrorist operations ? 
Poverty , racism , and ideological legacies are just as visible now as they were three or thirteen years ago . 
Terrorism has not exacerbated them . 
Security forces have not helped resolved them . 
On the contrary , the &quot; double terror &quot; induced by terrorism and counter-terrorism distracts public attention from those problems that , as some of us still remember , produced terrorism . 
Palestine and Chechnya , two sites of pain and terrorist infection , have not healed . 
Their national independence is now more elusive than it was before the terrorist era began . 
The past was , of course , far from perfect , but governments and peoples everywhere appeared more capable of tolerating failure . 
When battles were lost , talks began . 
These talks eventually resulted in the formation of respected countries , from Italy in the nineteenth century , to India in the middle of the twentieth century , to Eritrea near that century &apos;s end . 
Try to imagine Putin as Russia &apos;s leader in 1920 , when Poland gained its independence from Russia , or in 1991 , when Georgia did . 
Would he ever have engaged in peace talks ? 
Nowadays , Rudyard Kipling &apos;s imperialist Great Game is decomposing into a vicious circle . 
Security forces respond to the growth of terrorism . 
The growth of terrorism responds to the strengthening of security forces . 
The heavier the hand , it seems , the stronger the resistance ; the stronger the resistance , the heavier the hand . 
Real issues are buried beneath the crimes of the terrorists and the mistakes of the security forces . 
With every turn of the circle , both parties , terrorists and security forces , grow closer to each other . 
Their common interest is continuation of the game . 
Opposing parties use the same weapons , develop comparable tactics , and preach increasingly similar ideals . 
So it goes , until the rules of the game change . 
But why would they ? 
In Russian history , there is an analogous situation . 
At the beginning of the twentieth century , socialist revolutionaries led by Evno Asef embarked on a series of terrorist attacks against state officials . 
Somewhere along the line , Asef became a double agent . 
Sometimes he killed an official who was not on good terms with the police . 
At other times , the police simply did not want to betray their precious agent . 
Manipulating each other , the terrorists and the security guys became indistinguishable . 
Call this the &quot; Asef &quot; effect . 
Once such an alliance was shaped , nothing but revolution could stop it - in this case , the Bolshevik revolution . 
So the game must be stopped , if only for the survival of innocent bystanders - the rest of us . 
If you do not see humanity in your counterpart , you will not talk to him . 
You will either use him or kill him . 
So the &quot; other &quot; is elevated to the very center of high politics . 
This is the Asef effect in action . 
The Bolsheviks did it to the bourgeoisie . 
The Nazis did it to the Jews . 
But classical empires learned not to do it to colonized people . 
Over time , they invented fascinating ways to control their subjects , combining education , bribery , and force . 
Learning the great art of Orientalism , the classical empires knew how to keep talking while keeping their distance . 
Abolishing democracy in Russia &apos;s provinces , including Muslim-populated regions such as Tatarstan and Dagestan , is a deadly act . 
Civil peace in these areas was one of the few accomplishments of which contemporary Russia could be proud . 
So is Putin suicidal ? 
Unfortunately not . 
He owes his career to Chechnya , as Bush may owe his presidency to Iraq . 
But Chechnya , obliging as it is , is small , poor , and idiosyncratic . 
Converting vast areas of Russia into new Chechnyas , Putin and his clique calculate that - sooner rather than later - they will play out their games of terror and security with millions of Muslims in the oil-rich plains of Eurasia .
