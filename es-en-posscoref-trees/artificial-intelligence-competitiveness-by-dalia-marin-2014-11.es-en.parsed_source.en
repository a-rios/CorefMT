Education in the Second Machine Age 
MUNICH - Artificial intelligence , once confined to the realm of science fiction , is changing our lives . 
Cars are driving themselves . 
Drones are being programmed to deliver packages . 
Computers are learning to diagnose diseases . 
In a recent book , the economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee describe these recent advances as examples of the beginning of what they call &quot; the second machine age . &quot; 
The very name - the first machine age was the Industrial Revolution - suggests an epochal shift . 
One common forecast is that as ever-more advanced robots substitute workers , the cost of labor will become less important , and manufacturing will move back to rich countries . 
Another is that increasingly intelligent machines will reduce the demand for advanced skills , and that the economic advantage of having these skills will decline as a result . 
The first of these two hypotheses remains far-fetched . 
To be sure , there has been plenty of anecdotal evidence of &quot; reshoring &quot; - the relocation of jobs from low-wage countries to high-wage economies . 
Apple is shifting some manufacturing from China to Silicon Valley ; 
Airtex Design Group is moving part of its textile production from China back to the United States . 
In a recent survey of 384 firms in the eurozone by the management consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers , two-thirds of the respondents said that they had reshored some activities during the past year , and 50 % plan to do so in the next . 
But when one looks at the data , there is no sign of reshoring . 
Indeed , the trend is continuing in the opposite direction . 
Offshoring dropped during the Great Recession that followed the 2008 global financial crisis , but quickly rebounded , accelerating past pre-crisis levels . 
For the moment , the return of manufacturing to rich countries remains a prediction , not an outcome . 
Evaluating the second hypothesis is more complicated . 
At first glance , the evidence supports the possibility that demand for advanced skills is falling . 
With the exceptions of the US and Germany , the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers has been declining in all Western countries in the last 17 years . 
One possible explanation is that education levels in Europe outstripped the pace of technological change , oversupplying the market for advanced skills . 
In Austria , the share of people with a university degree or its equivalent increased by 250 % between 1996 and 2012 . 
In the United Kingdom and Italy , it almost doubled . 
In Spain , it jumped by 70 % , and in France by 60 % . 
By comparison , in the US and Germany , the share of the population with a tertiary education rose by a more modest 25 % . 
It is also possible , however , that the drop in the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers represents competition from increasingly intelligent machines . 
Here , the US is a case in point . 
Because educational attainment has been advancing only modestly in the US since the turn of the century , we would expect the wage gap to be rising steeply , as it did in the 1980s and 1990s . 
Instead , it has remained largely unchanged , and it is the unemployment rate among skilled workers that is on the rise , doubling in the US and the United Kingdom from 2000 to 2012 . 
Until the 1980s , about 70 % of income went to labor income and 30 % to capital income . 
It is now at about 58 % of GDP . 
According to research by the economists Loukas Karabarbounis and Brent Neiman , half of this decline is the result of cheaper information technology , which has enabled firms to replace workers with computers . 
The implications are serious . 
If these are indeed the first signs of the second machine age , it is possible that we have been fighting the wrong battle . 
As the scarcity of human capital declines in importance , the rapid expansion of education may not be the answer to the challenges of globalization that we hoped it would be .
