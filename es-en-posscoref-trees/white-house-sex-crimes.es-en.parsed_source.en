White House Sex Crimes 
NEW YORK - Sex crime has a telltale signature , even when those directing the outrages are some of the most powerful men and women in the United States . 
How extraordinary , then , to learn that one of the perpetrators of these crimes , Condoleezza Rice , has just led the debate in a special session of the United Nations Security Council on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war . 
I had a sense of déjà vu when I saw the photos that emerged in 2004 from Abu Ghraib prison . 
Even as the Bush administration was spinning the notion that the torture of prisoners was the work of &quot; a few bad apples &quot; low in the military hierarchy , I knew that we were seeing evidence of a systemic policy set at the top . 
It &apos;s not that I am a genius . 
It &apos;s simply that , having worked at a rape crisis center and been trained in the basics of sex crime , I have learned that all sex predators go about things in certain recognizable ways . 
We now know that the torture of prisoners was the result of a policy set in the White House by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Vice President Dick Cheney , and Rice - who actually chaired the torture meetings . 
The Pentagon has also acknowledged that it had authorized sexualized abuse of detainees as part of interrogation practices to be performed by female operatives . 
And documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union have Rumsfeld , in his own words , &quot; checking in &quot; on the sexualized humiliation of prisoners . 
The sexualization of torture from the top basically turned Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay into an organized sex-crime ring in which the trafficked sex slaves were US-held prisoners . 
Looking at the classic S and M nature of some of this torture , it is hard not to speculate that someone setting policy was aroused by all of this . 
The nonsexual torture that was committed ranged from beatings and suffocation , electrodes attached to genitals , and forced sleep deprivation , to prisoners being hung by the wrists from the ceiling and placed in solitary confinement until psychosis was induced . 
These abuses violate both US and international law . 
Three former military attorneys , recognizing this blunt truth , refused to participate in the &quot; military tribunals &quot; - rather , &quot; show trials &quot; - aimed at condemning men whose confessions were elicited through torture . 
Though we can now debate what the penalty for water-boarding should be , America as a nation , maintaining an odd silence , still cannot seem to discuss the sexual crimes involved . 
Why ? 
It &apos;s not as if the sex crimes that US leaders either authorized or tolerated are not staring Americans in the face : the images of male prisoners with their heads hooded with women &apos;s underwear ; the documented reports of female US soldiers deployed to smear menstrual blood on the faces of male prisoners , and of military interrogators or contractors forcing prisoners to simulate sex with each other , to penetrate themselves with objects , or to submit to being penetrated by objects . 
Indeed , the Military Commissions Act of 2006 was written deliberately with loopholes that gave immunity to perpetrators of many kinds of sexual humiliation and abuse . 
There is also the testimony by female soldiers such as Lynndie England about compelling male prisoners to masturbate , as well as an FBI memo objecting to a policy of &quot; highly aggressive interrogation techniques . &quot; 
The memo cites a female interrogator rubbing lotion on a shackled detainee and whispering in his ear - during Ramadan when sexual contact with a strange woman would be most offensive - then suddenly bending back his thumbs until he grimaced in pain , and violently grabbing his genitals . 
Sexual abuse in US-operated prisons got worse and worse over time , ultimately including , according to doctors who examined detainees , anal sodomy . 
All this may sound bizarre if you are a normal person , but it is standard operating procedure for sex offenders . 
Those who work in the field know that once sex abusers control a powerless victim , they will invariably push the boundaries with ever more extreme behavior . 
Abusers start by undressing their victims , but once that line has been breached , you are likely to hear from the victim about oral and anal penetration , greater and greater pain and fear being inflicted , and more and more carelessness about exposing the crimes as the perpetrator &apos;s inhibitions fall away . 
The perpetrator is also likely to engage in ever-escalating rationalizations , often arguing that the offenses serve a greater good . 
Finally , the victim is blamed for the abuse : in the case of the detainees , if they would only &quot; behave , &quot; and confess , they wouldn &apos;t bring all this on themselves . 
Silence , and even collusion , is also typical of sex crimes within a family . 
Americans are behaving like a dysfunctional family by shielding sex criminals in their midst through silence . 
Just as sex criminals - and the leaders who directed the use of rape and sexual abuse as a military strategy - were tried and sentenced after the wars in Bosnia and Sierra Leone , so Americans must hold accountable those who committed , or authorized , sex crimes in US-operated prisons . 
Throughout the world , this perverse and graphic criminality has added fuel to anxiety about US cultural and military power . 
These acts need to be called by their true names - war crimes and sex crimes - and people in America need to demand justice for the perpetrators and their victims . 
As in a family , only when people start to speak out and tell the truth about rape and sexual assault can the healing begin .
