Are We Working Ourselves to Death ? 
Work can give structure and meaning to life . 
But working conditions can also trigger or accelerate the symptoms of ill health - physical and mental - that feed back into our productivity and earning capacity , as well as into our social and family relationships . 
In fact , an alarmingly large number of people appear to be at risk . 
Of the EU &apos;s 160 million-strong labour force , 56 % report working at very high speeds , and 60 % to tight deadlines . 
More than a third have no influence on task order , and 40 % perform monotonous tasks . 
This probably contributes to a host of health-related problems : 15 % of the workforce complain of headaches , 33 % of backache , 23 % of fatigue , and 23 % of neck and shoulder pains , plus a host of other illnesses , including life-threatening ones . 
Sustained work-related stress is also an important determinant of depressive disorders - the fourth-largest cause of disease world-wide . 
They are expected to rank second by 2020 , behind only heart disease . 
In the EU , the cost of these and related mental health problems is estimated to average 3-4 % of GNP , amounting to approximately 265 billion euros annually . 
Moreover , sustained work-related stress is likely to contribute to &apos; metabolic syndrome , &apos; a cluster of pathogenic mechanisms characterised by an accumulation of abdominal fat , a decrease in sensitivity to insulin , increased levels of cholesterol , and heightened blood pressure , all related to the onset of heart disease and diabetes . 
Of course , working conditions may be experienced as threatening even when objectively they are not , or trivial symptoms may be interpreted as manifestations of serious illness . 
But stress is worrisome precisely because even misinterpretations can add to , or result in , a wide variety of health problems , including heart disease , stroke , cancer , musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal diseases , anxiety and depression , accidents , and suicides . 
Briefly stress consists of a pattern of built-in processes preparing the human organism for physical activity in response to demands and influences that tax its capacity to adapt . 
Activation of our &quot; fight or flight &quot; mechanism is an appropriate adaptive response when facing a wolf pack , but not so when struggling to adjust to rotating shifts , monotonous and fragmented tasks , or over-demanding customers . 
If sustained , stress is often maladaptive and eventually disease provoking . 
Stress-related paths to pathologies take a wide variety of forms . 
They can be emotional ( anxiety , depression , hypochondria , and alienation ) , cognitive ( loss of concentration or recall , inability to learn new things , be creative , make decisions ) , behavioural ( abuse of drugs , alcohol , and tobacco , refusal to seek or accept treatment ) , or physiological ( neuroendocrine and immunological dysfunction ) . 
To identify , prevent , and counteract the causes and consequences of work-related stress , we need to monitor job content , working conditions , terms of employment , social relations at work , health , well-being and productivity . 
The first step is to identify the incidence , prevalence , severity , and trends of work-related stress and its causes and health consequences . 
Are they likely to contribute to stress-related ill health ? 
Can they be changed ? 
Are such changes acceptable to workers and employers ? 
Wherever the answers are affirmative , an integrated package of organisational changes should be considered . 
Such changes are likely to include the following areas : 
Work schedule . Design labor time to avoid conflict with demands and responsibilities unrelated to the job ; 
Participation / control . Allow workers to take part in decisions or actions affecting their jobs ; 
Workload . Ensure that workers have enough time to complete assigned tasks , and allow for recovery from especially demanding physical or mental tasks ; 
Content . Design tasks to provide meaning , stimulation , a sense of completeness , and an opportunity to use skills ; 
Roles . Define work roles and responsibilities clearly ; 
Social environment . Ensure a working atmosphere free of all forms of invidious discrimination and harassment ; 
Future . Avoid ambiguity in matters of job security and career development ; promote life-long learning and employability . 
Although it is likely , the short- and long-term outcomes of such changes may not always suffice in the fight against work-related stress . 
They need therefore to be evaluated in terms of exposures and reactions to stress , the incidence and prevalence of ill health , and the quality and quantity of goods or services . 
Many companies world-wide recognize that success requires satisfying the three elements of sustainable development : financial , environmental , and social . 
Failure to do so leads , over time , to terminal organizational weakness , owing to lost credibility amongst employees , shareholders , customers , and communities . 
This has numerous implications for relations with employees . 
Ensuring long-term economic growth and social cohesion requires a commitment to health and safety , a better balance between work , family and leisure , lifelong learning , greater workforce diversity , gender-blind pay and career prospects , and profit-sharing and equity-ownership schemes . 
These practices can have a positive impact on profits through increased productivity , lower staff turnover , greater amenability to change , more innovation , and better , more reliable output . 
Indeed , companies often have an interest in going beyond minimum legal requirements : peer respect and a good reputation as an employer are marketable assets . 
The challenge for science is to find out what to do , for whom , and how . 
The challenge to workers , employers , governments , and communities is to translate what we now know into coordinated and sustainable programs .
