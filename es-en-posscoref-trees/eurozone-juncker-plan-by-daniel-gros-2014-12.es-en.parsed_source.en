Europe &apos;s Misguided Investment Mania 
BRUSSELS - The mantra in Brussels and throughout Europe nowadays is that investment holds the key to economic recovery . 
The lynchpin of the new European Commission &apos;s economic strategy is its recently unveiled plan to increase investment by € 315 billion ( $ 390 billion ) over the next three years . 
But the Commission &apos;s proposal is misguided , both in terms of its emphasis on investment and its proposed financing structure . 
The Commission &apos;s plan , the signature initiative of President Jean-Claude Juncker at the start of his term , comes as no surprise . 
With the eurozone stuck in a seemingly never-ending recession , the idea that growth-enhancing investment is crucial for a sustainable recovery has become deeply entrenched in public discourse . 
The underlying assumption is that more investment is always better , because it increases the capital stock and thus output . 
This is not necessarily the case in Europe at the moment . 
European Union authorities ( and many others ) argue that Europe - particularly the eurozone - suffers from an &quot; investment gap . &quot; 
The smoking gun is supposedly the € 400 billion annual shortfall relative to 2007 . 
But the comparison is misleading , because 2007 was the peak of a credit bubble that led to a lot of wasteful investment . 
The Commission recognizes this in its supporting documentation for the Juncker package , in which it argues that the pre-credit-boom years should be used as the benchmark for desirable investment levels today . 
According to that measure , the investment gap is only half as large . 
Unfortunately , even the pre-boom years are not a good guide for today &apos;s European economy , because something fundamental has changed more quickly than is typically recognized : Europe &apos;s demographic trends . 
The eurozone &apos;s working-age population had been growing until 2005 , but it will fall from 2015 onward . 
Given that productivity has not been picking up , fewer workers mean significantly lower potential growth rates . 
And a lower growth rate implies that less investment is needed to maintain the capital / output ratio . 
If the eurozone maintained its investment rate at the level of the pre-boom years , there would soon be much more capital relative to the size of the economy . 
One might be tempted to say : So what ? 
More capital is always good . 
An ever-increasing capital stock relative to output , however , means ever-lower returns to capital and thus ever more non-performing loans in the banking sector over time . 
Given the weak state of Europe &apos;s banking system , accumulating too much capital is not a luxury that the EU can afford . 
Even setting aside the question of whether more is always better , what can the Juncker plan do to have a positive short-run impact on aggregate investment ? 
Academic research on the determinants of investment has generally concluded that the key variable is growth ( or expectations of growth ) , and that interest rates play at most a secondary role . 
One immediate implication of this , of course , is that monetary policy is unlikely to have a strong impact on investment . 
Indeed , the market signal is clear : At present , there is no shortage of funding available in most of the EU . 
The countries on the eurozone periphery , where credit might still be scarce , account for less than one-quarter of Europe &apos;s economy . 
So a lack of funding is not the reason that investment remains weak . 
The Juncker plan is supposed to unlock , with € 21 billion in EU funding , projects worth 15 times as much ( € 315 billion ) . 
That sounds far-fetched . 
Europe &apos;s banking system already has more than € 1 trillion in capital . 
The addition of € 21 billion , in the form of guarantees from the EU budget , is unlikely to have a significant impact on banks &quot; willingness to finance investment . 
The Juncker plan targets , in particular , infrastructure projects , which are often riskier than other investments . 
But these risks usually are not financial ; they reflect potential political and regulatory barriers at the national level . 
These problems cannot be solved by a guarantee from the EU budget ( which in any case could not be larger than 1 / 15th of the value of the project ) . 
The reason why there still is no good interconnection between the Spanish and French power grids is not a lack of financing , but the unwillingness of monopolies on both sides of the border to open their markets . 
Many rail and road projects are also proceeding slowly , owing to local opposition , not a lack of financing . 
These are the real barriers to infrastructure investment in Europe . 
Large European companies can easily obtain financing at near-zero interest rates . 
Calling for more investment is superficially always attractive . 
But there are fundamental reasons to believe that the eurozone &apos;s investment rate will remain permanently depressed . 
The often-invoked investment gap is mostly a result of wishful thinking , and the remaining barriers to investment have little to do with a lack of financing . 
Economic performance in the United States and the United Kingdom holds an important lesson for the eurozone . 
Both economies &quot; recoveries have been driven largely by a pickup in consumption on the back of stronger household balance sheets , especially in the US . 
If European policymakers are serious about economic recovery , they should focus on consumption , not investment .
