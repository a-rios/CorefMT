Ukraine &apos;s Orange Christmas 
That Ukrainians will vote for their freedom this Christmas season is a coincidence of true perfection . 
As a result , something new will color the habits of those who govern Ukraine from now on : respect for individuals , which is the ultimate check on the abuse of power . 
Nothing can ever diminish what was at stake - and the victory that has been won - on the streets of Kyiv . 
Ukraine &apos;s people have renewed their self-respect through courage and resolution . 
They have reason to be proud . 
Self-confidence among the governed and caution among the rulers : these are the psychological springs of democracy and true freedom , and they can never again be diverted in our homeland . 
Nobody ever doubted that Ukraine had changed vastly in its twelve years of independence . 
Yet , caught in the sights of a gun barrel , nobody - not even the brave men and women who camped in their hundreds of thousands in the snow before Ukraine &apos;s parliament - knew with certainty whether those changes had wrenched Ukrainians from the grip of fear and apathy . 
The success of their defiance shows the power of the idea that bewilders outgoing President Leonid Kuchma and his acolytes : that democracy means taking responsibility for one &apos;s fate into one &apos;s own hands . 
The regime clearly expected the crowds that protested the fraudulent election of November 21 to scatter in apathy . 
They did not . 
By refusing to leave the streets and squares of Kyiv , Ukraine &apos;s mass volunteer army of democrats forced our country &apos;s gray old men of the past to retreat into the past . 
This is a breakthrough that will endure . 
For 70 cynical years , and for centuries before that , everything done in the name of Ukrainians was done without our consent . 
Corrupt regimes , through intimidation and bribery , insisted on the loyalty of the bureaucracy , police , and armed services . 
Newspapers and broadcasts were packed with lies . 
The Kuchma regime &apos;s vast wealth , stolen from ordinary Ukrainians , suggested that the reign of thuggery and deceit could go on forever . 
But Ukrainians have now given their seal of approval to democracy and an open society . 
From now on , the force of ideas , not the force of arms , will win the day . 
For once , Karl Marx , the mischievous cause of so much of Ukraine &apos;s misery , got something right : &quot; the point , &quot; he said about the world , &quot; is to change it . &quot; 
Of course , our movement was created out of opposition : opposition to corruption , opposition to surrendering our national independence , opposition to the rule of the bully . 
The joy of opposition is its simplicity ; 
Now we must lead a nation in which - thanks to the cynical ploys and hate-filled rhetoric of a discredited regime - some sections seem to be set against the democracy we seek to build . 
But no section of Ukraine is our enemy and none will be treated that way . 
We have shouted it from every platform in the country : end corruption and abuse of power for personal and partisan gain . 
It is a message carved on our hearts . 
Thus , our first task is legal and judicial reform , and here we are given hope by the courage of Ukraine &apos;s Supreme Court , which in overturning the stolen election of November 21 upheld the law and the liberties of Ukrainians against a regime determined to sweep them away . 
So we will resist the temptation of revenge and retribution . 
That way lays demoralization and new divisions . 
Ruling in the national interest , rather than for the benefit of favored sections or clans , we will apply the law equally to our supporters and our opponents . 
We will be guided , and bound , by the rule of law - and the spirit of ordered liberty that animates it . 
Of course , immense difficulties remain . 
The first is repairing our country &apos;s unity . 
Yes , Ukraine has Ukrainian speakers and it has Russian speakers ; yes , it has Orthodox and Catholics . 
Ukrainians recoil , in anger and horror , at the very idea of dividing the nation . 
Our nation &apos;s unity is not artificial . 
We are united as a people and in our shared history of suffering . 
Having laid the foundations of genuine democracy , our house will not be divided by anyone . 
In renewing our liberties , we will renew our unity . 
We will renew Ukraine .
