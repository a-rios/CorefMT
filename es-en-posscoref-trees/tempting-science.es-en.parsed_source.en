Tempting Science 
Scientists everywhere are increasingly uneasy at the rising influence of business upon university research . 
They realize that direct financial connections with the private sector can damage their reputation for independence and integrity . 
Nevertheless , the traditional doors separating academia from industry are being quietly dismantled - sometimes even smashed down . 
Specious free-market doctrines are devaluing the public services that those doors protected , not least the free flow of well-informed , critical speech that is vital to open inquiry . 
Of course every scientist wants more money to do research ; and every nation needs as much good science as it can get . 
But good science is expensive : so if some perfectly reputable company is prepared to pay for it , why be choosy ? 
Industrial research is an immense asset to society , not least in advancing scientific knowledge . 
But commercial firms are not philanthropies . 
They are under constant competitive pressures ; shareholders expect a return on their investment . 
Even when not trying to buy exclusive access to profitable new discoveries , they are always in the market for preferential consideration . 
Valuable gifts may appear to purchase intangible favours . 
Cash for scientific answers is not as obviously corrupt as cash for parliamentary questions , but smells as nasty . 
So far , there have been few open scandals . 
Scientists in both academia and industry can still be trusted to do their work with honesty . 
In most fields of university research , direct external influences - military and political as well as commercial - are trivial . 
But a number of worrying cases of falsification or fabrication can be traced back to direct pressures from funding sources . 
In some disciplines it is becoming difficult to find academic scientists who are not in some way dependent on corporate support . 
The bodies that fund and publish research are now asking specialist referees and authors to declare all such connections , in case these might seem to affect their scientific judgement . 
Disclosure of &apos; conflict of interest &apos; is becoming as mandatory in the world of science as in politics and law . 
Most academic scientists doubtless hope that formal countermeasures like these will hold back the forces of Mammon . 
But increased transparency also reveals the blatant instrumentalism that now pervades university research . 
Demonstrable utility is the over-riding priority . 
Even governments now fund science primarily for its promise of public or private gain . 
Yet academic science plays an important &apos; non-instrumental &apos; role in society . 
It enriches us spiritually with trustworthy knowledge about humanity and the world . 
It warns us of hidden environmental dangers and opens up unexpected paths of technical progress . 
It brings an element of hard-nosed critical rationality into all societal debate , and fosters awareness of uncertainty and change in the professional education of skilled practitioners . 
Above all , academic scientists are in continual demand as independent experts in public arenas of controversy and decision . 
In short , university research is the principal intelligence agency of civil society . 
It is often supposed that science is able to perform these functions because it is so completely rational and objective . 
Unfortunately , this supposition is not supported by serious philosophical analysis or sociological observation . 
In reality , what makes scientific knowledge so credible is that it is produced by an open , imaginative , self-critical , disinterested , communal process . It is these institutional characteristics of scientific research that win our worldly-wise trust . 
People seldom appreciate how deeply these characteristics are woven into the university tradition . 
For example , lecturers and professors are not tested for their expertise , nor employed to carry out specific research projects . 
Nevertheless , customary practices such as &apos; publish or perish , &apos; peer review and academic tenure ensure that they are indeed good scientists . 
They retain their intellectual autonomy , but could only have won their university posts - and thereby access to research facilities - on the basis of competitive assessments of the originality and promise of their published research . 
University research organised in this manner is only one of many possible ways of carrying out &apos; public science.&apos; 
The key point is that up to now it has had a distinctive non-instrumental role that cannot be performed by &apos; proprietary science.&apos; 
However technically sound they may be , research results that have been deliberately produced , in secret , for corporate profit are inevitably suspected of bias . 
By admitting &apos; conflict of interest , &apos; scientists engaged in such research show that they cannot disengage themselves from the worldly agendas of their patrons . 
Nor can they exemplify to their students the fundamental scientific values of intellectual autonomy and open dissent . 
No matter how potent and sincere their expertise , it can do little to strengthen civil society or the public good . 
Of course the funding of science raises many political and economic problems . 
For example , how should governments justify public expenditure on completely &apos; useless &apos; disciplines such as particle physics and astronomy ? 
But these problems are not solved by handing them over to &apos; market forces.&apos; 
Indeed , it is in highly commercialised fields such as biomedicine that the merging of public and proprietary science is most worrying . 
This is precisely where societal demands for trustworthy scientific knowledge and non-partisan expertise are most pressing . 
The fashionable call for ever-closer union between academia , industry and government ignores a vital element of the scientific enterprise . 
These great sectors of our economy and polity will surely go on evolving internally , and interacting energetically , beyond anything we can easily foresee . 
In each sector , the research system will be reformed and reconfigured along with the knowledge that it produces . 
But scientists in all three sectors should fight openly against changes that fail to recognise , celebrate , and fully support the distinctive , irreplaceable role of &apos; public science &apos; in an open , pluralistic society .
