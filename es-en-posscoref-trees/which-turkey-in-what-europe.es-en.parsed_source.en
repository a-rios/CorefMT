Which Turkey in What Europe ? 
&quot; A tempest in a teapot &quot; is perhaps the best description of the recent squabbles about opening the European Union &apos;s accession negotiations with Turkey . 
The election in Germany was in part fought on the issue , as Chancellor Angela Merkel ran on a platform of offering Turkey a &quot; privileged partnership , &quot; rather than full admission . 
The Austrian government &apos;s posturing - motivated as much by its upcoming elections as genuine foreign policy concerns - seemed to threaten the opening of the accession talks themselves . 
But German foreign policy has always been marked by continuity , and the new foreign minister , Frank-Walter Steinmeier , the chief of staff under former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , has repeatedly advocated full membership for Turkey . 
It is thus unlikely that the Grand Coalition will adopt a different political approach towards Turkey than the previous Red-Green government . 
After a bit of drama , Austria also gave up its opposition to the accession talks , in exchange for a promise of admission for Croatia , and the intra-European squabbles have been patched up . 
So the British , under Tony Blair &apos;s current presidency of the EU Council of Ministers , have gotten their way for now , and the Americans - keen backers of Turkey &apos;s EU aspirations - have once again succeeded in acting as a &quot; European power . &quot; 
Accession negotiations with Turkey are now a fact . 
But much of the debate about Turkey &apos;s possible accession has been focused on the wrong issues : whether Turkey is culturally &quot; in line &quot; with Europe or whether Europe is in some sense &quot; Christian &quot; and could assimilate 100 million Muslims . 
The real issue - not disputed even by most Turks - is that Turkey is neither economically ready nor , above all , a mature enough democracy for full EU membership . 
and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , Turkey &apos;s prime minister , can place his trust in the near automatic mechanisms that characterize the EU &apos;s instDespite substantial progress , democratization is only a torso . 
Human and civil rights still do not meet Western European standards , religious and ethnic minorities are recognized only on paper , acknowledgment of the historic genocide of the Armenians is given mere lip service , and civilian control over the military remains weak . 
Raising this long list of shortcomings puts Western critics in an uncomfortable position with their pro-European Turkish interlocutors . 
Turkey &apos;s pro-Western forces find just as much fault with their country &apos;s political system as the European critics , but they expect the prospect of EU membership to accelerate the progress of reforms . 
Nationalist Turks , on the other hand , regard joining the EU mainly as a confirmation of national power and view all criticism of the country as a violation of Turks &quot; collective honor . 
Had the start of accession negotiations been postponed or canceled , Turkey &apos;s pro-Europeans would have suffered from a nationalist backlash . 
Even now , Turkey &apos;s unrequited love for Europe can still fade into aversion , with Islamic fundamentalism and Greater Turkey nationalism continuing to represent other , eastward-leaning options . 
Advocates of a conditioned accession are thus under extraordinary pressure to be nice , even as Turkish officials stage provocations , like the recent suit against the noted author Orhan Pamuk for &quot; public denigration of Turkish identity &quot; because he dared to question the official position on the Armenian genocide . 
As a result , a general lack of clarity about what kind of Turkey should be accepted characterizes the accession debate , which focuses - much as in the recent referenda on the EU constitution in France and the Netherlands - on rather meaningless generalities . 
But , more importantly , the lack of clarity on the Turkish accession question reflects Europe &apos;s ambivalence regarding its image of itself . 
To be sure , Turkey shows substantial political and cultural differences , especially when it comes to the importance of civil society , sexual equality , and the role of religion in public life . 
But the real question is this : what kind of Europe do Europeans themselves want ? 
&quot; Deepening &quot; and &quot; widening &quot; European integration are the superficial opposites here . 
Austria does not want any more members - with the inconsistent exception of Croatia - but wants to deepen the EU &apos;s political and cultural unity . 
Many &quot; old &quot; Europeans , including Germany after Schröder &apos;s resignation and France under a weakened Jacques Chirac , share that stance . 
Britain , the leading nation of &quot; new &quot; Europe , has no desire for an EU constitution , more executive and parliamentary power in Brussels , a stronger European Parliament , or the euro . 
Like many new members , Britain prefers a loosely connected Europe of different nations - essentially a free-trade zone , but with open borders at its periphery - with sufficient strategic coordination to constitute a quasi-empire in geopolitical terms , on a par with the United States . 
The fundamental difference is that a loosely tied Union is attractive to all sorts of aspirants , including Georgia , Ukraine , and other Soviet successor states - and perhaps even North African countries like Morocco - while a &quot; deepened &quot; Europe , with a clear political identity , high social-welfare entitlements , and growing cultural homogeneity , would naturally set itself apart and not be particularly attractive to these countries . 
Paradoxically , then , what the British , with their opposition to &quot; deepening &quot; European integration , are really offering the Turks is precisely the sort of &quot; privileged partnership &quot; that Austria , together with Angela Merkel , has been backing . 
Both positions reject the idea of making Turkey really &quot; European . &quot; 
The structure that Britain seems to have in mind is , according to some , reminiscent of the loose alliance binding the British Commonwealth . 
But &quot; History &apos;s ruse &quot; could be that even as the British succeed in improving Turkey &apos;s prospects for admission , the renegotiation of the Nice treaty , which will become necessary if Croatia is admitted , is likely to lead to stronger European integration . 
Thus , what we may get is both deepening and widening of the EU - something that today seems like squaring the circle .
