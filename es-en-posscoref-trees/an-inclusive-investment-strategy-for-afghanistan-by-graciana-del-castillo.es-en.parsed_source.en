Leveling the Afghan Playing Field 
NEW YORK - Afghanistan &apos;s security and political situation remains plagued by uncertainty , stemming from the withdrawal of United States and NATO combat troops , the upcoming presidential election , and the stalled peace negotiations with the Taliban . 
Recognizing that continued economic insecurity will exacerbate this perilous situation , the government has announced a new package of economic incentives aimed at attracting foreign direct investment . 
The package includes the provision of land to industrialists at dramatically reduced prices , tax exemptions of up to seven years for factory owners , and low-interest loans of up to ten years for farmers . 
Such incentives are targeted at foreign investors and the local elite , with the aim of stopping or even reversing capital flight . 
But the new measures ultimately amount to more of the same : a fragmented policy approach that will prove inadequate to solve Afghanistan &apos;s fundamental economic problems . 
In the early stages of the post-war transition , FDI increased rapidly , rising from 1.2 % of GDP in 2002 to a peak of 4.3 % of GDP in 2005 . 
Most of these inflows were directed toward the construction and services sectors - the main drivers of GDP growth - and aimed to satisfy international demand , both civilian and military . 
But , in 2006-2007 , FDI levels began to fall , owing to a sharply deteriorating security situation , a continued lack of electricity and adequate infrastructure , a shortage of skilled labor , inadequate legal and regulatory systems , inefficient bureaucratic procedures , and the need to renew companies &quot; licenses annually . 
Land grabs , chronic corruption , impunity , the inability to enforce contracts , and the fragmentation and ineffectiveness of aid deterred foreign and domestic investment further . 
As a result , FDI collapsed to less than 0.5 % of GDP annually in 2011-2012 . 
Moreover , in the effort to develop two of the world &apos;s largest mines , investors &quot; greed prevailed over their security and business-climate concerns . 
In 2007 , the Metallurgical Corporation of China won the concession for the Aynak copper deposit in Logar Province . 
In 2011 , a group of Indian state and private companies won the concession for the Hajigak iron-ore deposit in Bamyan Province . 
But , despite these projects &quot; reported billion-dollar price tags and high expectations , the investments have catalyzed little progress , owing partly to security issues . 
Worse , the mines &quot; displacement of residents , underpayment of workers , and environmental damage have generated resentment in local communities , which is likely to grow in the future . 
After all , the granting of mineral resources to foreigners reduces - and could even eliminate - their benefits for local people . 
As it stands , Afghanistan &apos;s economy is a house of cards . 
Aid levels are comparable to GDP , with donors covering roughly two-thirds of government expenditure and the entire current-account deficit , which amounts to 40 % of GDP . 
But aid is falling and expected to drop sharply after 2014 . 
Rather than continuing to pursue piecemeal measures like those that it has just approved , the government needs to implement an integrated and targeted strategy for the reactivation of investment , employment , and trade . 
Indeed , a drastic shift in policy is essential to avoid economic collapse . 
In order to reduce the risks associated with investing in Afghanistan , the government must create a system that benefits local communities and foreign investors alike . 
This can be achieved with a strategy based on two distinct but mutually beneficial &quot; reconstruction zones &quot; : an export-oriented zone ( ERZ ) and a local-production zone ( LRZ ) . 
The ERZ , focused exclusively on producing goods for export , would provide tax incentives , basic infrastructure and services , security , and a stable legal framework to investors . 
In exchange , investors would commit to train local workers , create employment by purchasing local inputs and services , improve corporate practices and local providers &quot; standards , facilitate technology transfers , and establish links with local technical schools and universities . 
The LRZ would enable local people to improve their livelihoods though the production of agricultural goods , the efficient delivery of services , and light manufacturing . 
Such a scheme would also help to bolster gender equality by providing a level playing field for all Afghans in terms of security , social services , infrastructure , credit , and inputs ( such as seeds , fertilizers , and agricultural machinery ) . 
Moreover , it would boost food supplies and reduce Afghanistan &apos;s exorbitant dependence on imports . 
By focusing exclusively on foreigners and domestic elites for investment , Afghanistan is missing out on the vast potential of micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses to contribute to steady GDP growth . 
Achieving long-overdue peace and stability will be impossible without them .
