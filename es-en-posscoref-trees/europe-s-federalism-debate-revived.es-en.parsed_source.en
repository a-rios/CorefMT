Europe &apos;s Federalism Debate Revived 
BRUSSELS - It is an old debate , but tensions within the euro area have revived it : can a monetary union survive without some form of fiscal federalism ? 
This issue is of persistent concern for investors worldwide . 
Holders of European government bonds believed that they knew what they had bought . 
Sure , there was no such thing as a eurozone sovereign security . 
Investors now recognize that they did not really understand what these bonds represented - that is , the institutional construct behind the European currency . 
But if investors actually take that lesson to heart , the European crisis will be far from over . 
So , should Europe embrace fiscal federalism in order to strengthen the eurozone and restore investor confidence ? 
The problem is that fiscal federalism means different things to different people . 
Americans think they know what it is : a central government with a large budget ( about 20 % of GDP ) , whose macroeconomic role is to carry out counter-cyclical spending and taxation , as most US states are constitutionally committed to some sort of balanced budget . 
This was clearly true in the case of the stimulus program launched in 2009 , which included federal transfers to the states to sustain state-level fiscal spending . 
Similarly , when a state such as Michigan is hit by recession in its key economic sector ( the auto industry ) , Washington collects less federal tax but maintains - if not increases - local spending , which partially offsets the shock to state income . 
Economically , therefore , the federal budget cushions regional shocks automatically through discretionary action and stabilizing transfers to the states . 
Politically , it embodies solidarity and thus helps cement the union . 
If this is what is meant by federalism , it is better for the European Union to forget about it . 
The EU budget amounts to about 1 % of GDP , just one-fortieth of total public expenditure . 
No one , not even die-hard European integrationists , imagines that it can reach 5 % of GDP ( it is more likely to decrease ) . 
A second solution is what can be called &quot; distributive federalism . &quot; 
The goal is not to absorb shocks but to reduce income gaps across regions . 
In Germany , tax revenues are redistributed between the Länder . 
This is another form of solidarity , which also exists in the EU , where regional development funds are allocated to poorer regions to foster catch-up growth . 
These transfers are significant for poor countries : about € 300 per person for Greece and Portugal every year from 2000 to 2006 . 
Europe , in this respect , is not qualitatively different from the US . 
These transfers have accelerated convergence when put to good use ( for example , in several Spanish provinces ) , but have been ineffective when wasted ( as in Greece ) . 
Germans , who since reunification in 1990 know what they are talking about when it comes to such transfers , do not want to hear about a Europe where rich regions would permanently finance pockets of under-development . 
They are not alone in this . 
What , then ? 
Conceptually , the eurozone must include solidarity with countries facing hardship , because this is what unites and gives strength to the whole - but without the heavy machinery of a federal budget or a permanent increase in transfers . 
It needs some sort of mutual insurance , or what could be termed &quot; insurance-based federalism . &quot; 
This is what inspired the decision taken in May to create the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) , by which assistance can be provided , jointly with the International Monetary Fund , to partner countries in times of crisis . 
It is also what inspired the European Central Bank to launch an asset-purchase program , which has been used to buy Greek and Portuguese government bonds . 
But the uproar caused by these decisions reinforces , rather than dispels , doubts . 
In Germany , many consider the EFSF a breach of the fundamental principle that EU governments cannot be bailed-out by their partners . 
And the transformation of the central bank into a quasi-fiscal agent ( because if Greek debt is restructured , the ECB will record losses ) is regarded with horror , as it violates the separation between money and public finances . 
Instead , it is claimed , eurozone members should have been allowed to default . 
No matter that the public debt of the average US state is less than 0.5 % of total US GDP , compared to 5 % in the eurozone , which implies that the financial impact of a eurozone sovereign default would be much stronger . 
So there is no agreement yet to make the EFSF permanent , and it has been designed to be as un-federal as possible . 
When it comes to ECB purchases of government bonds , no one understands exactly for how long and for what purpose the new weapon is to be used - which reduces its effectiveness . 
Meanwhile , proposals for pre-adoption assessment of national budgets by the EU have attracted criticism in France and elsewhere , which serves as a reminder of the distance there is between calls for coordination and actual acceptance of its implications . 
The Europeans have begun to assemble the bricks for a new building , but without having agreed on its size and design . 
For the time being , they rather give the impression to have thrown sandbags in disorder in an attempt to stop a wave . 
It is time to accept that those who finance EU governments through purchasing their bonds are entitled to ask inconvenient questions , and to expect clear answers .
