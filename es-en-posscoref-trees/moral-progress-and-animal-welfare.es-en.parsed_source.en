Moral Progress and Animal Welfare 
PRINCETON - Mahatma Gandhi acutely observed that &quot; the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated . &quot; 
To seek to reduce the suffering of those who are completely under one &apos;s domination , and unable to fight back , is truly a mark of a civilized society . 
Charting the progress of animal-welfare legislation around the world is therefore an indication of moral progress more generally . 
Last month , parallel developments on opposite sides of the world gave us grounds for thinking that the world may , slowly and haltingly , be becoming a little more civilized . 
First , the British House of Commons passed a motion directing the government to impose a ban on the use of wild animals in circuses . 
The motion followed the release of undercover footage , obtained by Animal Defenders International , of a circus worker repeatedly beating Anne , an elephant . 
The measure was , at least initially , opposed by the Conservative government , but supported by members of all political parties . 
In a triumph for parliamentary democracy , the motion passed without dissent . 
More controversially , the lower house of the Dutch parliament passed a law giving the Jewish and Islamic communities a year to provide evidence that animals slaughtered by traditional methods do not experience greater pain than those that are stunned before they are killed . 
If the evidence cannot be provided , stunning before slaughter will be required in the Netherlands . 
At times , it has seemed that gains for animals in Western countries have been outweighed by increasing animal abuse in China , as growing prosperity there boosts demand for animal products . 
I found it difficult to watch the videotape of the beating of Anne , but that recording did not compare to videos I have seen of animal cruelty in China . 
The sickening footage available online shows bears kept in cages so small that they cannot stand up , or in some cases move at all , so that bile can be taken from them . 
Worse still ( if one can compare such atrocities ) is a video showing fur-bearing animals being skinned alive and thrown onto a pile of other animals , where they are left to die slowly . 
In light - perhaps one should say darkness - of such images , it is sometimes suggested that animal welfare is exclusively a Western concern . 
But that is implausible , given that Buddhist tradition places more emphasis on concern for animals than Judaism , Christianity , or Islam . 
Long before Western philosophers included animals in their ethics , Chinese philosophers like Zhuangzi said that love should permeate relations not only between humans , but between all sentient beings . 
Nowadays , China has its own animal-rights campaigners , and there are signs that their message is beginning to be heard . 
One recent sign again concerns circuses . 
Chinese zoos have drawn crowds by staging animal spectacles , and by allowing members of the public to buy live chickens , goats , and horses in order to watch them being pulled apart by lions , tigers , and other big cats . 
Now the Chinese government has forbidden state-owned zoos from taking part in such cruelty . 
Welcome as these initiatives are , the number of animals in circuses and zoos is tiny compared to the tens of billions of animals suffering in factory farms . 
In this area , Western countries have set a deplorable example . 
Recently , however , the European Union has recognized that the intensive confinement of farm animals has gone too far . 
It has already outlawed keeping veal calves in individual stalls , and , in six months , it will be illegal in all 27 EU countries , from Portugal to Poland and from Britain to Greece , to keep laying hens in the bare-wire cages that today dominate the egg industry around the world . 
In January 2013 , keeping breeding sows in individual stalls will also be prohibited . 
The United States lags behind Europe in getting rid of the worst forms of abuse of farm animals . 
The problem does not lie with voters , who , in states like Florida , Arizona , and California , have shown that they want farm animals to have better protection than the animal industries typically provide . 
The biggest problems are in those states that lack a mechanism for citizens to initiate a referendum on how farm animals should be treated . 
Unfortunately , this group includes the Midwestern and southern states , where the majority of America &apos;s farmed animals are produced . 
China &apos;s centralized government can , if it so chooses , ensure that animal-welfare laws apply throughout the country . 
The animal-welfare movement in China should not be satisfied with its small but conspicuous success regarding animal abuse in zoos . 
It must move on to the far more significant target of better living conditions and more humane deaths for bears and fur-bearing animals , as well as for cows , pigs , laying hens , and chickens . 
There remain many other countries with deplorable animal-welfare standards . 
In Indonesia , for example , Animals Australia recorded undercover videos showing such brutal treatment of Australian-raised cattle that Australia &apos;s government suspended cattle exports to the country . 
Now some MPs are calling for a permanent ban . 
The best hope for further progress , it seems , lies in animal welfare becoming , like human rights , an international issue that affects countries &quot; reputations .
