The Great Bank Escape 
STANFORD - This year has proven to be yet another replete with futile efforts to manage the outsize grip that banks and bankers have on the world economy . 
The global financial system remains distorted and dangerous . 
Since the 1980 &quot; s , &quot; shareholder value &quot; has increasingly become the focus of corporate governance . 
Managers and board members often receive stock-based compensation , which gives them equity ownership rights and , in turn , creates a powerful incentive to maximize the market value of their companies &quot; shares . 
But actions taken in the name of shareholder value often benefit only those whose wealth is closely tied to the company &apos;s profits , and may actually be harmful to many shareholders . 
Despite their claims that they are pursuing shareholder value , the actions of top managers , in particular , often reflect only their own interests , rather than those of shareholders who often hold the great majority of the shares . 
This discrepancy can be seen clearly in the banking sector . 
Before 2007 , banks enjoyed high returns and soaring stock prices . 
But excessive indebtedness and losses on the risky investments that had been made triggered the global financial crisis and led to the failure , or near-failure , of many major financial institutions . 
Banks with substantial overhanging debt reduced lending , and , despite the massive intervention of governments and central banks , the crisis dragged down the global economy . 
As a result , since 2008 , shareholders have lost substantially on their investments in banks . 
The crisis - together with the prolonged economic downturn that followed - caused diversified shareholders to lose on their other investments , too . 
Furthermore , many bank shareholders have suffered from the disruption in lending , either directly or via their businesses or employers . 
Some have even lost their jobs . 
And , along with other taxpayers , they incurred some of the cost of the bailouts . 
And yet , despite large losses on their holdings in 2007-2008 , top bankers fared significantly better than most of their shareholders did in 2000-2008 . 
Even executives of the failed investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation , while the companies &quot; shareholders , who received some dividends along the way , fared much worse - not even considering their other crisis-related losses . 
To safeguard their interests , bankers have lobbied relentlessly against regulations that would require them to rely less on borrowing and more on retained earnings or new equity to fund their lending and investments . 
They cite the need to deliver high returns for shareholders , implying that tighter regulations undermine shareholders &quot; interests . 
But safer , less indebted banks are better able to continue lending without becoming distressed or needing support . 
As a result , they are less likely to destabilize the global financial system or impose harm on most shareholders and the public . 
Bankers also claim that higher equity requirements would restrict credit and hinder economic growth . 
But their arguments are flawed and misleading . 
For example , they use return on equity as their primary measure of profitability , but neglect to distinguish between ROE and shareholder value . 
In fact , in the single-minded quest for higher returns , bankers might expose shareholders to excessive risk , without compensating them adequately . 
And bankers neglect to acknowledge the role of government guarantees and subsidies in making so much borrowing possible and attractive . 
Contrary to bankers &quot; claims , increasing equity requirements significantly , and thus safeguarding the financial system &apos;s stability , is in the public interest - including the interest of most shareholders . 
By contrast , preserving the status quo , or implementing inadequate regulation , would allow bankers to continue to profit at the expense of others . 
Small shareholders cannot easily influence banks &quot; decisions , especially on complex risk-related issues . 
And banks &quot; boards of directors , which wield ultimate control , are not legally required to consider the broader impact of their actions on others . 
Instead , their narrow perspective - which tends to coincide with executives &quot; preferences even at the expense of other shareholders - dictates their decision-making . 
Even from banks &quot; narrow standpoint , higher equity requirements would cost less than other proposed regulations . 
And such requirements would reduce the likelihood that strong banks would be called upon to finance the resolution of failed institutions . 
( Of course , these considerations are less relevant if bankers expect to succeed in blocking all regulation aimed at reducing excessive risk-taking , and to be bailed out in a crisis . ) 
As matters stand , bankers continue to benefit fully from the upside of their investments , while sharing the downside with creditors and taxpayers - and sometimes with shareholders . 
Although some progress has been made in improving regulation and enforcement , industry lobbies have largely succeeded in delaying essential reforms needed to ensure global financial stability . 
JPMorgan Chase &apos;s CEO Jamie Dimon reportedly told his daughter that a financial crisis &quot; happens every five to seven years . &quot; 
Last month , the bank paid $ 1.1 billion in dividends , reducing its ability to absorb future losses on its investments . 
If policymakers and regulators do not strengthen their reform efforts , taxpayers and shareholders - not bankers like Dimon - will be the ones who suffer the consequences of the next crisis as well .
