Securing Japan 
TOKYO - Shinzo Abe &apos;s second term as Japan &apos;s prime minister began with a laser-like focus on economic revitalization . 
That policy , almost instantly dubbed &quot; Abenomics , &quot; comprises what have been called the three &quot; arrows &quot; : bold monetary policy , an expansionary fiscal stance , and structural reforms to stimulate private investment . 
Hosting the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020 has added a fourth arrow to this quiver in the form of increased infrastructure investment and tourism revenue in the years leading up to the Games . 
To be sure , after 15 years of deflationary recession , revitalization of the Japanese economy remains far from complete . 
Nonetheless , the effects of Abe &apos;s reforms are becoming visible in areas such as equity prices and exchange rates . 
But Abe also confronts a security environment in Asia that is every bit as brittle as Japan &apos;s economy was before his government took office last December . 
Indeed , he confronted many of the same issues during his first administration seven years ago . 
His efforts back then were halted by his own resignation , and he is now making a second attempt to establish a national-security governance system to meet Japan &apos;s needs - and those of its allies - in twenty-first-century Asia . 
In a speech to a plenary session of the lower house of Japan &apos;s Diet on October 25 , Abe emphasized that , given the current security situation in Asia , &quot; It is essential to strengthen command functions for implementing the prime minister &apos;s national security policy . &quot; 
Now that split control of the Diet &apos;s upper and lower houses has been resolved , with Abe &apos;s Liberal Democrats in strong control of both chambers , a bill to modernize Japan &apos;s national-security governance is certain to pass . 
The bill that Abe has submitted aims to establish a Japanese National Security Council , based on lessons from the successes and failures of similar institutions in other countries , such as the NSC in the United States . 
The Security Council of Japan - something of a stopgap measure created to provide advice from relevant cabinet members to the prime minister in times of crisis - will now be reorganized as a formal institution . 
The new NSC &apos;s membership will be limited to the prime minister , the cabinet secretary , and the foreign and defense ministers , with relevant ministers added on an ad hoc basis . 
A permanent National Security Secretariat , headed by a person with abundant diplomatic experience , will be established in the prime minister &apos;s office , with 60 security specialists from various fields laying the policy groundwork for medium- and long-term national security strategy . 
This strategy will then be reflected in guidelines issued to Japan &apos;s defense bodies and diplomats . 
Japan , like other countries , has faced jurisdictional disputes among foreign-policy , defense , and police agencies that have hindered the aggregation and analysis of intelligence information . 
But , with the creation of the NSC , each ministry and agency will report important national-security information to the new secretariat , which will then carry out integrated analysis and issue reports to the prime minister and others . 
Of course , as in other countries , bureaucracies are creatures of habit . 
As we can already see , it will not be easy to overcome the obstacles posed by vertically integrated ministries and agencies . 
Institutionalization will take time - and the importance of its success cannot be understated . 
For example , the new NSC will be responsible for sharing intelligence with other countries , including the US , Japan &apos;s most important ally . 
As a result , ensuring the protection of information will be a key issue , particularly given the old habit of leaking security information to the press . 
That is why the Diet is also considering a bill on the protection of classified information that would impose harsher punishment on government officials who leak secrets , particularly those concerning national security . 
The trauma of gag laws that were imposed on the press before and during World War II resulted in the elimination of all restraints afterwards , which had the effect of making Japan a spy &apos;s paradise , with insufficient counterintelligence measures and poor secrecy . 
Moreover , the long decades of peace since 1945 have served to lower awareness among politicians of the need for confidentiality . 
For example , Japanese newspapers always report when , where , and with whom the Prime Minister met for dinner in the following day &apos;s editions . 
In contrast to the US system of presidential government , Japan has a parliamentary form of government . 
Yet the goals of national security and crisis management are the same in both systems - indeed , one of British Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s first acts when he came to power was to establish an NSC to improve coordination of policymaking . 
Although the establishment of the Japanese NSC is long overdue , it is not too late for Japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coherence that it seems certain to bring .
