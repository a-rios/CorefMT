Reinvigorate the Rich to Help the Poor 
WASHINGTON , DC - For the third time in five years , the world &apos;s poorest countries are at risk of being hit by a crisis not of their making - a prospective downturn brought on by financial turmoil in the world &apos;s most advanced economies . 
Having gone through the food and fuel shock of 2007-2008 and the global financial crisis that followed , low-income countries may now face even larger disruptions in 2012 . 
And , given the interdependence of today &apos;s globalized world , poor countries &quot; distress will invariably have unwelcome consequences for everyone , rich and poor alike . 
At the height of the global crisis in 2009 , many low-income countries experienced a slowdown in growth marked by falling exports , lower remittances from expatriate workers , and subdued foreign investment . 
The social consequences were severe : the World Bank estimates that an additional 64 million people were left in extreme poverty by the end of 2010 . 
Yet it could have been much worse . 
Thanks to greatly improved policy performance over the previous decade , low-income countries entered the crisis far better positioned to withstand shocks than in the past . 
They had smaller fiscal and current-account deficits , lower inflation , larger international reserves , and - thanks in part to debt relief - lower debt burdens . 
As a result , most countries were able to maintain or even increase spending , despite lower revenues , and allow fiscal deficits to widen . 
This propped up economic growth , while also boosting outlays for critical investments and social programs needed to lessen the hardships faced by the poorest people . 
The downturn was also relatively short-lived , partly as a result of the greater openness to world trade that lower-income countries have embraced over the past decade . 
But these countries are still highly vulnerable . 
Many have not had sufficient time to rebuild the policy buffers that served them so well . 
There is less ammunition left in the fiscal arsenal , current-account deficits have widened , reserves have declined , and debt levels have risen significantly in some countries . 
Moreover , with the advanced economies facing budgetary pressures , foreign aid may be severely constrained for some time to come . 
Under these circumstances , it is by no means certain that low-income countries will have access to additional concessional financing . 
As a result , a new global downturn would hit low-income countries hard . 
Simulations by the International Monetary Fund suggest that a decline in global growth of 1.5 percentage points could , owing to its impact on trade and financial flows , generate a $ 27 billion gap in additional external financing in 2012 alone . 
That would also push 23 million more people - most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia - into poverty . 
What can countries do to help themselves ? 
The scope for fiscal stimulus is more limited than in 2009 , but countries with sufficient fiscal room and available financing should maintain spending levels and preserve critical social and infrastructure programs . 
Countries with moderate inflation could be more assertive with monetary and exchange-rate policy . 
A key priority for 2012 and subsequent years must be to build increased resilience against shocks . 
Low-income countries should boost their revenue bases to reduce reliance on external financing , while improving the efficiency of spending . 
In particular , improving the scope and targeting of social safety nets would go a long way toward protecting the poorest in the event of a further global downturn . 
Several countries , including Armenia , Burkina Faso , Sierra Leone , Ghana , and Kenya , have already made successful strides in this direction , using means-tested food-voucher programs , maternal and family benefits , school-based social services , and conditional cash-transfer schemes targeting the most vulnerable groups , such as orphans . 
Over the longer term , low-income countries would benefit from diversifying their economies and avoiding over-dependence on a few products and trading partners . 
More diversified economies are also likely to deliver more inclusive growth - growth that creates jobs for more people , and that distributes its benefits more widely . 
In order to boost long-term growth prospects and productivity , low-income countries will also need to meet huge infrastructure needs , especially in the area of electricity generation and transportation . 
What can we do to help ? 
The IMF is ready to assist with policy advice , financial support , and technical assistance . 
We have boosted our concessional lending capacity to $ 17 billion through 2014 , and doubled the amounts countries can draw . 
We have also cut interest rates on all concessional lending to zero through 2012 . 
We have made our lending instruments more flexible , so that financial support can reach our members quickly , leaving sufficient room for high-priority spending to support growth and protect the most vulnerable . 
Ultimately , the best way that the international community can help the low-income countries is for the advanced economies to get their houses in order and restore strong and sustainable global growth . 
That will help to ensure that low-income countries remain on track to consolidate and extend the impressive achievements of the last decade .
