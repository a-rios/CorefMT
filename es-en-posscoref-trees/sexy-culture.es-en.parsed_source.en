Sexy Culture 
Why is there culture ? 
What motivates people to write poems , paint , or sing ? 
Most people engaged in these activities would respond with answers like , &quot; because I like to &quot; or , &quot; because it fulfills me , &quot; if not , &quot; I feel obliged not to waste my talent . &quot; 
They tend to believe that culture reflects the existence of a soul type , or that it &apos;s an expression of humans &quot; intelligence and creativity . 
Natural science - as so often - has a more mundane answer , one that has to do with natural selection . 
In his seminal work on evolution , On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life , Charles Darwin used the much-cited expression &quot; survival of the fittest . &quot; 
Most people find it easy to understand that being especially strong or fast , or able to withstand hunger , heat , or cold , can increase the chances of survival . 
Intelligence also falls into that category . 
In his later work , Darwin introduced another selection criteria that may be just as important , but which has received much less attention : mating preference , or sexual selection . 
His reason for doing so was to explain male peacocks &quot; obviously hindering tail feathers and male lions &quot; apparently useless manes . 
These characteristics would reduce rather than enhance the bearer &apos;s chances of survival , but obviously they prevailed in generation after generation . 
Thus , Darwin argued , they must increase the probability of more offspring by making the males more attractive to female mates . 
As Darwin did not believe that pure aesthetics would guide female peacocks and lions in their choice of mating partners , he had to find a rational reason for females &quot; preference for males with hindering characteristics . 
The very fact , he reasoned , that these features make life harder signals to prospective partners that individuals who can do reasonably well with them have an especially good genetic set-up and are thus likely to produce strong offspring . 
They should therefore be preferred mates . 
Evolutionary biologists have since taken the concept further . 
If someone can do difficult things , not only carrying peacock tail feathers or a long dark lion mane , but also things that require much practice without contributing to physical fitness and survival , and yet stay alive , that individual must have especially good genes . 
They are therefore sexually attractive . 
Culture - at least the culture we are proud of and don &apos;t sneer at - is highly elitist . 
We admire the best , and only the best , according to some cultural and time-dependent standard . 
It does not help much to sing pop songs or opera arias in the bathroom . 
You must be able to draw a listening and cheering crowd to qualify for the elite . 
Likewise , the amateur painter does not increase her or his attractiveness much compared to a van Gogh or a Picasso . 
The same goes for writers . 
A vanity press autobiography does not bring you to the top . 
For that , you have to be a Nobel laureate or at least the author of a couple of well regarded books . 
The bottom line is that while many are called , few are chosen . 
Reaching the top requires not only talent and luck , but also a lot of practices - that is , time wasted from the point of view of survival . 
Sport is in this respect also a form of culture , albeit one that is often sneered at by those engaged in pursuits like classical music or serious literature . 
Most sports certainly contribute to physical fitness - as do some other expressions of culture , such as ballet - but what we admire in a player who can do extraordinary things with a ball is a technique that is utterly useless outside the playing field and has taken thousands of hours of practice to bring to perfection . 
Here , of course , it &apos;s only the best that become local or national heroes . 
To be a devoted football or basketball player in the lowest series brings ridicule rather than fame . 
It must be hard and require enormous effort to acquire the unique skills that mark the superstar and earn societies &quot; respect and admiration . 
Following this reasoning , what makes the poet , the painter , and the singer attractive is uselessness combined with the difficulty of their activity . 
The harder and more futile the activity , the better and more sexually attractive is the performer . 
Naturally , self-awareness of this underlying wish to be sexually attractive is not required . 
The mechanism works all the same . 
The poet , painter , and singer may think they do what they do for more high-minded reasons , but scientists know otherwise . 
Hey , science is hard , too !
