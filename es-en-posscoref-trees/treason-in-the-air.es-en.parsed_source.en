Treason in the Air 
COPENHAGEN - Discussions about global warming are marked by an increasing desire to stamp out &quot; impure &quot; thinking , to the point of questioning the value of democratic debate . 
In March , Al Gore &apos;s science adviser and prominent climate researcher , Jim Hansen , proclaimed that when it comes to dealing with global warming , the &quot; democratic process isn &apos;t working . &quot; 
Although science has demonstrated that CO2 from fossil fuels is heating the planet , politicians are unwilling to follow his advice and stop building coal-fired power plants . 
Hansen argues that , &quot; the first action that people should take is to use the democratic process . 
What is frustrating people , me included , is that democratic action affects elections , but what we get then from political leaders is greenwash . &quot; 
Although he doesn &apos;t tell us what the second or third action is , he has turned up in a British court to defend six activists who damaged a coal power station . 
He argues that we need &quot; more people chaining themselves to coal plants , &quot; a point repeated by Gore . 
The Nobel laureate in economics Paul Krugman goes further . 
After the narrow passage of the Waxman-Markey climate-change bill in the United States House of Representatives , Krugman said that there was no justification for a vote against it . 
He called virtually all of the members who voted against it , &quot; climate deniers &quot; who were committing &quot; treason against the planet . &quot; 
Krugman said that the &quot; irresponsibility and immorality &quot; of the representatives &quot; democratic viewpoints were &quot; unforgivable &quot; and a &quot; betrayal . &quot; 
He thus accused almost half of the democratically elected members of the House , from both parties , of treason for holding the views that they do - thereby essentially negating democracy . 
Less well-known pundits make similar points , suggesting that people with &quot; incorrect &quot; views on global warming should face Nuremburg-style trials or be tried for crimes against humanity . 
There is clearly a trend . 
The climate threat is so great - and democracies are doing so little about it - that people conclude that maybe democracy is part of the problem , and that perhaps people ought not to be allowed to express heterodox opinions on such an important topic . 
This is scary , although not without historical precedent . 
Much of the American McCarthyism of the 1940 &quot; s and 1950 &quot; s was driven by the same burning faith in the righteousness of the mission - a faith that saw fundamental rights abrogated . 
We would be well served to go down a different path . 
Gore and others often argue that if the science of climate change concludes that CO2 emissions are harmful , it follows that we should stop those harmful emissions - and that we are morally obliged to do so . 
But this misses half the story . 
We do no such thing , because we recognize that the costs of high-speed cars must be weighed against the benefits of a mobile society . 
Indeed , nobody emits CO2 for fun . 
CO2 emissions result from other , generally beneficial acts , such as burning coal to keep warm , burning kerosene to cook , or burning gas to transport people . 
The benefits of fossil fuels must be weighed against the costs of global warming . 
Gore and Hansen want a moratorium on coal-fired power plants , but neglect the fact that the hundreds of new power plants that will be opened in China and India in the coming years could lift a billion people out of poverty . 
Negating this outcome through a moratorium is clearly no unmitigated good . 
Likewise , reasonable people can differ on their interpretation of the Waxman-Markey bill . 
Even if we set aside its masses of pork-barrel spending , and analyses that show it may allow more emissions in the US for the first decades , there are more fundamental problems with this legislation . 
At a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars annually , it will have virtually no impact on climate change . 
If all of the bill &apos;s many provisions were entirely fulfilled , economic models show that it would reduce the temperature by the end of the century by 0.11 째 C ( 0.2 째 F ) - reducing warming by less than 4 % . 
Even if every Kyoto-obligated country passed its own , duplicate Waxman-Markey bills - which is implausible and would incur significantly higher costs - the global reduction would amount to just 0.22 째 C ( 0.35 째 F ) by the end of this century . 
The reduction in global temperature would not be measurable in a hundred years , yet the cost would be significant and payable now . 
Is it really treason against the planet to express some skepticism about whether this is the right way forward ? 
Is it treason to question throwing huge sums of money at a policy that will do virtually no good in a hundred years ? 
Is it unreasonable to point out that the inevitable creation of trade barriers that will ensue from Waxman-Markey could eventually cost the world ten times more than the damage climate change could ever have wrought ? 
Today &apos;s focus on ineffective and costly climate policies shows poor judgment . 
Everybody involved in this discussion should spend more time building and acknowledging good arguments , and less time telling others what they cannot say . 
Wanting to shut down the discussion is simply treason against reason .
