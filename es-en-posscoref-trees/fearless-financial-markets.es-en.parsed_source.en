Fearless Financial Markets 
A number of thoughtful observers - like Citigroup &apos;s Robert Rubin , Harvard &apos;s Larry Summers , and The Financial Times &apos;s Martin Wolf - have expressed puzzlement in recent months about financial markets &quot; perceptions of risk . 
While markets have judged today &apos;s world - especially the dollar and securities linked to it - to have low risk when viewed in historical perspective , geopolitical risks in fact appear to be large . 
Wolf , for example , argues that financial markets have adopted a head-in-the-sand focus on the &quot; long run of small gains , &quot; ignoring the &quot; occasional calamity &quot; in advance , while losses will be attributed after the fact to &quot; unforeseeable bad luck . &quot; 
But if an investor today did wish to insure against geopolitical catastrophe , how would he or she do so ? 
In the generation before World War I , the safe assets were thought to be the debt of governments tied to the gold standard , which supposedly offered protection against the inflationary populist viruses that afflicted countries like Mexico , France , or the United States . 
But investors in British government debt faced huge losses when Britain &apos;s commitment to World War I produced inflation , and investors in Czarist bonds papered their bathrooms with them after the October Revolution . 
After the inflations of World War I , a prudent investor might have thought gold - easily assessable , portable , and real - an attractive asset . 
But gold is stagnant , while capital is productive . 
In any case , American gold holders found their wealth involuntarily transformed into paper dollars by the Roosevelt administration at the nadir of the Great Depression . 
Following World War II , investments in the US seemed safer than any alternative . 
But , in the 1970 &quot; s , investors in American stocks and long-term bonds lost half their principal , and even investors in short-term American debt were down by 20 % in real terms by the end of the decade . 
Investors fearing geopolitical catastrophe might cope to some degree by raising their consumption spending . 
But there is a limit to this option . 
Those who fear geopolitical catastrophe will sell assets , putting downward pressure on their value , only if there are other , safer assets that they see that they can buy . 
As Harvard &apos;s Robert Barro has recently pointed out , fear of a general or unpredictable catastrophe - even one that spares a subset of assets that cannot be specified in advance - will not affect relative asset prices , because investors have no motive to sell or buy any particular asset . 
According to Barro , the consequences of enhanced fear of a general or unpredictable catastrophe depend on how it affects the global pool of savings . 
Fear as much as institutional blockages may be the source of what is either a global savings glut or a global investment shortfall , depending on how you view it . 
If people are risk-averse enough that increased fear of the future causes them to save more , rising global uncertainty will raise bond and stock prices , and lower interest rates and dividend and earnings yields . 
Creating new assets for investors to hold costs resources , and the greater the demand for such assets the higher the marginal cost of creating them . 
This may be the situation that the world financial system is in now . 
The principal fear , at least in the circles in which I move , is of a sudden unwinding of &quot; global imbalances &quot; : a rapid and destabilizing end to America &apos;s very large trade deficit and to Asia &apos;s very large trade surplus . 
In such a global financial crisis , if the Federal Reserve accommodates inflation and accelerates devaluation in order to prevent collapsing employment in formerly foreign capital-financed sectors from spiraling into a depression , American debt will be among the worst affected assets ? 
But if the Fed refuses to accommodate inflation produced by a dollar collapse and accepts a depression in the belief that the long-run benefits of maintaining its credibility as a guarantor of price stability will come before we are all dead , American equities will suffer . 
Chinese property values and manufacturing assets would also be vulnerable , as the US abandons its role as importer of last resort and China &apos;s coastal-export development strategy turns out to be a dead end . 
Don &apos;t get me wrong : somewhat more than half my brain agrees with Rubin , Summers , Wolf , and company . 
The principal risk I see today is that being borne by investors in dollar-denominated debt - and I don &apos;t believe they are charging a fair price for what they are doing . 
But a quarter of my brain wonders how investors should attempt to insure against the lowest tail of the economic-political distribution , and that quarter of my brain cannot see which way somebody hoping to insure against that risk should jump .
