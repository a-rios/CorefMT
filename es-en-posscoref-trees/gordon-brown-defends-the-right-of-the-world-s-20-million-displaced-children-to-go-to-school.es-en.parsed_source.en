Education Without Borders 
LONDON - As the third anniversary of the start of Syria &apos;s civil war approaches , there is a race against time to deliver a groundbreaking education project to the conflict &apos;s hardest-hit victims - hundreds of thousands of child refugees . 
A shocking three million Syrian children have now been displaced . 
More than one million of them have fled Syria and are languishing in camps in neighboring countries , particularly Lebanon , Jordan , and Turkey . 
These children are now suffering a third winter away from their homes , schools , and friends . 
Many are separated from their families , and thousands more join the ranks of displaced persons every day in what is becoming the largest humanitarian catastrophe of our time . 
But a pathbreaking initiative in Lebanon , involving teachers , aid agencies , and education charities has opened a small window of hope . 
Amid the chaos of camps , makeshift huts , and destitution , the fight for an important new principle of international aid has begun : even in times of conflict , children must have access to education . 
A century and a half ago , the Red Cross established the norm that health care could - and should - be provided even in conflict zones . 
This principle was carried forward by groups like Médicins sans Frontières , whose doctors have risked their lives for the last four decades to deliver medical care to the world &apos;s most dangerous places . 
Now Lebanon is the site of a pilot program to advance the idea that providing education for refugee children is equally feasible - and no less important . 
Across 1,500 communities in this troubled , divided country , where Syrian refugee children now make up 20 % of the school-age population , the aim is to establish children &apos;s right to education as a humanitarian priority . 
The typical refugee child spends more than ten years away from home . 
Three years ago , most Syrian children were at school , and the country had near universal primary education . 
Today , millions of children are being denied any chance to realize their talents . 
The scars will last for decades . 
So , in Syria and the surrounding region , there is already a lost generation in the making : children who are now eight and nine and who have never been to school , children condemned to work as child laborers , and hundreds of girls forced into early marriages . 
There are gruesome tales of young people who have been forced to sell their kidneys and other organs simply to survive . 
Of course , we must provide food , shelter , and vaccinations . 
The pilot project in Lebanon , designed by Kevin Watkins of the United Kingdom &apos;s Overseas Development Institute and led by the United Nations Children &apos;s Fund ( UNICEF ) and the UN High Commission for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , creates the opportunity to establish a right to education irrespective of borders . 
Indeed , it is designed to cater to all 435,000 Syrian child refugees now in the country . 
Thanks to a historic agreement with the Lebanese government , places for hundreds of thousands of children can be created within weeks by putting 1,500 of Lebanon &apos;s schools on a double-shift system . 
The scheme is already being piloted in a small village called Akroum in the north of the country . 
Lebanese children are taught during the first shift , and Syrian children in the second . 
Using the same school for both sets of pupils means that education can be delivered at a cost of only £ 400 ( $ 670 ) per child per year . 
To secure places for all refugee children , we are seeking $ 195 million dollars a year for UNICEF and UNHCR , with the plan to be implemented on the ground by NGOs and the Lebanese authorities . 
The aim is to secure all funding during March , as the world marks the third anniversary of this tragic exodus from Syria . 
We have already assembled a coalition of ten donor countries to take the lead , but we need ten more donors to fund the project fully . 
We are appealing to donors not just to create thousands of school places for desperately needy children , but also to establish a precedent for the 20 million other children driven by violent conflict into displaced-persons camps and shantytowns . 
There cannot be universal educational opportunity for the worlds &quot; children without an agreement that we will cater to children in conflict zones . 
One million Afghan children are in camps along the border with Pakistan . 
Thousands of children in South Sudan still await their first chance to go to school , and schools have yet to be provided for a million more children in the war-torn Central African Republic . 
These children &apos;s chances now depend on showing that we can make progress in Lebanon . 
The UN Millennium Development Goals , adopted in 2000 , expire in December 2015 , which means that time is running to meet the deadline for achieving the target of universal primary education . 
That goal will remain unattainable unless and until we establish the long-overdue principle that a child &apos;s right to education knows no boundaries .
