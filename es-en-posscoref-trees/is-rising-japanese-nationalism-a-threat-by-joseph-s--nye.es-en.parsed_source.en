Japan &apos;s Nationalist Turn 
TOKYO - Japan has been in the news lately , owing to its dispute with China over six square kilometers of barren islets in the East China Sea that Japan calls the Senkakus and China calls the Diaoyu Islands . 
The rival claims date back to the late nineteenth century , but the recent flare-up , which led to widespread anti-Japanese demonstrations in China , started in September when Japan &apos;s government purchased three of the tiny islets from their private Japanese owner . 
Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has said that he decided to purchase the islands for the Japanese central government to prevent Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara from purchasing them with municipal funds . 
Ishihara , who has since resigned from office to launch a new political party , is well known for nationalist provocation , and Noda feared that he would try to occupy the islands or find other ways to use them to provoke China and whip up popular support in Japan . 
Top Chinese officials , however , did not accept Noda &apos;s explanation , and interpreted the purchase as proof that Japan is trying to disrupt the status quo . 
In May 1972 , when the United States returned the Okinawa Prefecture to Japan , the transfer included the Senkaku Islands , which the US had administered from Okinawa . 
A few months later , when China and Japan normalized their post-World War II relations , Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka asked Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai about the Senkakus , and was told that rather than let the dispute delay normalization , the issue should be left for future generations . 
So both countries maintained their claims to sovereignty . 
Though Japan had administrative control , Chinese ships would occasionally enter Japanese waters to assert their legal position . 
For China , this was the status quo that Japan upended in September . 
In Beijing recently , Chinese analysts told me that they believe that Japan is entering a period of right-wing militaristic nationalism , and that purchasing the islands was a deliberate effort to begin eroding the post-WWII settlement . 
While Chinese rhetoric is overheated , there is certainly a rightward shift in mood in Japan , though it would be difficult to describe it as militaristic . 
A large group of students at Waseda University recently were polled on their attitudes toward the military . 
While a significant number expressed a desire for Japan to improve its ability to defend itself , an overwhelming majority rejected the idea of developing nuclear arms and supported continued reliance on the US-Japan Security Treaty . 
As one young professional told me , &quot; we are interested in conservative nationalism , not militaristic nationalism . 
No one wants to return to the 1930 &quot; s . &quot; 
And , of course , Japan &apos;s Self Defense Forces are professional and under full civilian control . 
Japan faces parliamentary elections in the near future , by August 2013 at the latest , but perhaps as early as the start of the year . 
According to public-opinion polls , the governing Democratic Party of Japan , which came to power in 2009 , is likely to be replaced by the Liberal Democratic Party , whose president , Shinzo Abe , would become prime minister - a position he has already held . 
Abe has a reputation as a nationalist , and recently visited the Yasukuni Shrine , a Tokyo war memorial that is controversial in China and Korea . 
In addition , Toru Hashimoto , the young mayor of Osaka , Japan &apos;s second-largest city , has built a new party and also developed a reputation as a nationalist . 
Japanese politics , it seems , is showing signs of two decades of low economic growth , which has led to fiscal problems and a more inward-looking attitude among younger people . 
Undergraduate enrollment of Japanese students in US universities has fallen by more than 50 % since 2000 . 
Thirty years ago , Harvard professor Ezra Vogel published Japan as Number 1 : Lessons for America , a book that celebrated Japan &apos;s manufacturing-fueled rise to become the world &apos;s second-largest economy . 
Recently , Vogel has described Japan &apos;s political system as &quot; an absolute mess , &quot; with prime ministers replaced almost every year and the youngest generation &apos;s expectations sapped by years of deflation . 
Yoichi Funabashi , former Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper Asahi Shimbun , also is worried : &quot; There &apos;s a sense in Japan that we are unprepared to be a tough , competitive player in this global world . &quot; 
Despite these problems , Japan still has remarkable strengths . 
Although China surpassed Japan as the world &apos;s second-largest economy two years ago , Japan is a comfortable society with a much higher per capita income . 
It has impressive universities and a high education level , well- managed global companies , and a strong work ethic . 
It is a society that has reinvented itself twice in less than 200 years - in the nineteenth-century Meiji Restoration and after defeat in 1945 . 
Some analysts hoped that last year &apos;s earthquake , tsunami , and nuclear catastrophe would spark a third effort at national reinvention , but that has not yet occurred . 
Many younger Japanese have told me that they are &quot; fed up &quot; with stagnation and drift . 
When asked about the rightward trend in politics , some young Diet ( parliament ) members said they hoped that it might produce a realignment among political parties that would lead to a more stable and effective national government . 
If a moderate nationalism is harnessed to the yoke of political reform , the results could be good for Japan - and for the rest of the world . 
But if Japan &apos;s deepening nationalist mood leads to symbolic and populist positions that win votes at home but antagonize its neighbors , both Japan and the world will be worse off . 
What happens in Japanese politics over the coming months will ripple far beyond the country &apos;s shores .
