Down with Dengism 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - China has recently held a series of solemn , high-profile ceremonies , barely noticed by the outside world , in honor of the 110th anniversary of former leader Deng Xiaoping &apos;s birth . 
But , as with most political festivities in China these days , few have bothered to reflect on what is being celebrated - and what Deng &apos;s leadership actually meant . 
The truth is that , while Deng deserves appreciation for having brought China back from the abyss of Maoism , his approach - &quot; Dengism , &quot; or authoritarian developmentalism - is now impeding China &apos;s prospects . 
Distinguishing Deng the reformer from Dengism the governing philosophy is no idle academic exercise . 
Deng , who risked his authority and that of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) to break with Maoist convention and launch China &apos;s economic revolution , died in 1997 . 
Dengism , which emphasizes the goal of modernization under a powerful one-party state , continues to shape China &apos;s governance system . 
Deng , who famously declared , &quot; A cat &apos;s color does not matter as long as it catches mice , &quot; is generally remembered as an unabashed pragmatist . 
But even pragmatists have core principles that limit their actions , and Deng was no exception . 
Two ideas were incontrovertible : the CCP could retain its grip on power only by delivering economic development , and China could modernize only under a strong one-party system . 
Thus , rejection of democracy in any form was fundamental to Deng &apos;s viewpoint . 
Though he advocated legal reform as a tool of modernization , Deng was adamant that the rule of law not be allowed to limit the CCP &apos;s power . 
To be sure , Deng recognized some of the pathologies of the party-state . 
With leadership positions allocated - often for life - on the basis of personal connections , rather than merit , he understood that the system suffered from gross inefficiency , risk aversion , and a lack of technical expertise . 
But Deng was convinced that administrative reforms could resolve these issues . 
What he did not anticipate was how difficult it would be to overcome resistance from within the CCP to any diminution of its powers . 
The slow pace of reform frustrated Deng so much that , in the late 1980s , he asked the reformist premier Zhao Ziyang to lead a secret high-level task force to examine options for more radical changes - this time , directly targeting the political system . 
But when the group asserted that progress toward modernization would require the incorporation of some democratic principles and the rule of law , Deng immediately quashed the initiative . 
His view that modernization required keeping power concentrated in the hands of a single party failed to anticipate the threat that a predatory state would pose to sustained development . 
Herein lies the tragedy of Dengism . 
It gained credibility from the fact that its creator dismantled a cruel and destructive system , and left behind a more prosperous and humane China . 
But that credibility has been used to justify the maintenance of a system that is now hampering China &apos;s continued progress . 
Dengism &apos;s greatest intellectual failure is its inability to account for the potential of unchecked power to nurture greed and corruption among ruling elites . 
Its greatest political failure is its resistance to the democratic reforms needed to constrain that power . 
During Deng &apos;s rule , Dengism &apos;s inherent contradictions and limitations were less apparent . 
After all , the Chinese people had been repressed for so long that economic reforms alone represented a huge step forward . 
Indeed , by creating space for individual creativity and entrepreneurship , they unleashed a historically unprecedented period of rapid growth that lifted millions of Chinese out of poverty . 
But the lack of political reform meant that there was nothing to stop the ruling elites from appropriating a disproportionate share of the new wealth . 
Recent revelations of systemic corruption at all levels of government demonstrate that the gravest threat to China &apos;s long-term economic success is the unchallenged , unruly party-state . 
The good news is that President Xi Jinping seems to recognize this problem . 
Beyond taking up Deng &apos;s mantle in pursuing market-oriented economic reforms , he has been directing a bold anti-corruption campaign since coming to power . 
In July , he launched a formal investigation into one of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s most senior figures , Zhou Yongkang - a testament to his commitment to rooting out abuse of power . 
Xi &apos;s desire to become China &apos;s next great reformer may well be why his government has been investing so much energy in lauding Deng &apos;s achievements . 
One hopes that he continues to emulate Deng , without allowing his approach to become distorted by Dengism .
