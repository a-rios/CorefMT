Now For An Arab Economic Revolution 
BEIRUT - Revolution across the Arab world has forced the region &apos;s peoples and governments to grapple with the need for change . 
Years of sclerosis have given way to a frantic push for reforms to match the aspirations and discontent of millions . 
But reform momentum is tugging in two , quite opposite , directions . 
One push is for governments to provide for their people ; the other calls for governments to stop restricting their people &apos;s freedom , particularly their economic liberty . The first type of reform will likely only exacerbate the Arab world &apos;s grave problems ; the second offers hope for positive and sustainable change . 
In several Arab countries , most notably Saudi Arabia , rulers have sought to quell popular discontent by providing a combination of cash , subsidies , guaranteed jobs , and free goods and services . 
Such largesse betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the causes of today &apos;s discontent , because it assumes that these causes are purely material . 
But any examination of the protesters &quot; slogans and demands clearly indicates otherwise . 
The protests are much more about political and economic freedom than about material needs , reflecting a keen awareness that such needs are merely a symptom and consequence of the absence of political and economic freedom . 
The dominant &quot; handout approach &quot; is not sustainable , and , if continued , would likely exacerbate the Arab world &apos;s current economic malaise . 
Economic wealth cannot be created by government decree ; it comes from productive jobs that create goods and services that people value . 
Governments that hand out benefits are not making their citizens richer by generating new wealth ; they are simply redistributing existing wealth . 
This also applies to government-created and guaranteed jobs : if a job is indeed productive , its output would be rewarded by other members of society who benefit from it , without the need for government subsidies and guarantees . 
The fact that government guarantees a job implies that its output is not wanted . 
Such jobs are a liability for society , not an asset . 
As citizens start relying on redistribution , productive work is discouraged , and real wealth creation suffers . 
Economic rot sets in as the ranks of dependent citizens grow , productive citizens dwindle in number , and society eventually runs out of other people &apos;s money . 
But the popularity of the handout option raises an important and instructive question : just how did the ruling classes in these countries amass fortunes so large that people are clamoring for them to be redistributed ? 
Government officials and their cronies did not necessarily engage in straightforward theft or pillaging . 
Through innocuous-sounding government &quot; supervision &quot; and &quot; regulation &quot; - and under the guidance of the major international financial institutions - ruling elites managed to run entire sectors of the economy as personal fiefdoms . 
While this pattern of official behavior is reprehensible , the real disaster is that it destroyed Arabs &quot; economic productivity and initiative . 
This economic totalitarianism has been legitimated by government charity . 
Arab elites have been engaged in a false embrace of economic reforms for decades , with countless ministerial shuffles , five-year plans , and elaborate World Bank and International Monetary Fund programs . 
By framing the debate on reform as being about the type of handouts , governments evade tackling the real problem : their control of economic activity . 
State handouts can be reliably financed only by controlling the economy &apos;s productive sectors . But in the Arab world , as everywhere else , this leads to theft , corruption , uncompetitive monopolies , a stifling of enterprise , and , eventually and inevitably , to decline and decay . 
The toppled Tunisian and Egyptian regimes spent decades providing handouts while denying citizens economic freedom . 
As Arabs confront far-reaching change , they must not be distracted into fruitless debates about the right types of government support for citizens . 
What is needed is a root and branch transformation of the way that economic activity is carried out in all Arab nations . 
Arab countries need to become places where people can create their own productive jobs , pursue their own opportunities , provide for themselves , and determine their own future . 
This freedom obviates the need for the charity of those in power , and more importantly , takes away from them the excuse for maintaining their iron grip over the economic lives of their citizens .
