The Borders of Liberalism 
When it comes to whether and how to regulate the economy , Western societies have a history of liberal theory upon which to rely . 
But when it comes to immigration , there is not much in the liberal tradition to which they can turn . 
As a result , in both Europe and the United States , much of the debate over immigration is dominated by illiberal voices , the most insistent belonging to politicians who promise to protect the cultural integrity of the homeland against the presumed degeneracy of the alien . 
Xenophobia is an illiberal response to immigration from the right , but multiculturalism represents much the same thing from the left . 
Many multicultural theorists , although committed to openness toward immigrants , are not committed to the openness of immigrants to their new home . 
For them , newcomers , living in an environment hostile to their way of life , need to preserve the cultural practices they bring with them , even if some of those practices - for example , arranged marriages , gender segregation , religious indoctrination - conflict with liberal principles . 
Group survival counts more than individual rights in the moral accounting of many multiculturalists . 
One way to maintain a commitment to openness when addressing the vexing question of national borders is to recognize that cosmopolitanism is a two-way street . 
Immanuel Kant teaches us that the circumstances in which we find ourselves must always be judged against the circumstances in which , but for chance , we might have found ourselves . 
From this perspective , it is unfair that someone who happens to be born in the US is likely to live longer and better than someone born in Kenya . 
This does not mean that the US must open its borders to everyone from Kenya . But it does mean that a New Yorker should recognize that any advantages he may have over a Nairobian are due to an accident of birth rather than merit . 
From the perspective of Kantian cosmopolitanism , the least an American can do is to welcome a certain amount of immigration from Africa . 
But embracing cosmopolitanism also means that once a society admits new members , those members are obliged to open themselves to their new society . 
Multiculturalists are reluctant to endorse this part of the cosmopolitan bargain , but liberals must . 
One can understand why , living in a foreign country they may perceive as hostile , immigrants opt to close themselves off , and some host countries - France , for example -may be too hasty in demanding that immigrants accept new ways of life . 
But attempting to live a closed life in an open society is bound to be self-defeating and not something a liberal society should encourage . 
An instructive example of the cosmopolitanism bargain came in 2006 , when Great Britain &apos;s former foreign minister , Jack Straw , raised concerns about the nijab , the full-head covering worn by some Muslim women . 
Straw defended women &apos;s right to wear less intrusive headscarves ; yet he also argued that something is seriously wrong when , in conversation with another person , one cannot engage in face-to-face interaction . 
Straw was saying that to wear the nijab is a decision to close yourself off from everyone around you . 
He was not making a xenophobic argument that Muslims do not belong in Great Britain , or a multiculturalist argument that Muslims should be allowed to wear whatever traditional garb they believe best expresses their cultural and religious sensibilities . 
Nor was he asking for the full assimilation of immigrants to British customs . 
Instead , through a carefully chosen example , Straw was illustrating what it means to be open to others while expecting openness in return . 
Some argued that , in suggesting to Muslim women what they should wear , Straw was interfering with religious freedom . 
In fact , liberal values sometimes contradict each other . 
Islam , for example , has historically permitted certain forms of polygamy , but no liberal society is obliged to extend religious freedom in ways that undermine its commitment to gender equality . 
Fortunately , Straw &apos;s example does not pose such a sharp dilemma . 
As he pointed out , wearing the nijab is not commanded by the Koran and represents a cultural choice , not a religious duty . 
So long as other ways are available for Muslim women to cover their heads , agreeing not to wear the nijab is a way of signifying one &apos;s membership in a liberal society at minimal cost to one &apos;s religious commitments . 
For liberals , the question is never whether borders should be completely open or closed ; a society open to all would have no rights worth protecting , while a society closed to all would have no rights worth emulating . 
If one is looking for an abstract principle to follow on questions of immigration , liberalism cannot provide it . 
But a liberal society will allow people in and make exceptions for conditions under which they must be kept out , rather than keeping people out and making exceptions for when they should be allowed in . 
A liberal society will also view the world as teeming with potential that , however threatening to ways of life that are taken for granted , forces people to adapt to new challenges rather than trying to protect themselves against the foreign and unknown . 
Finally , a liberal society will not focus on what we can offer immigrants , but on what they can offer us . 
The goal of openness implied by immigration is worth preserving , especially if both its demands and its promise apply across the board .
