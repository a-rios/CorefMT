The Environment of Poverty 
COPENHAGEN - Despite gains in life expectancy , expanded access to education , and lower rates of poverty and hunger , the world has a long way to go to improve the quality of people &apos;s lives . 
Almost a billion people still go to bed hungry , 1.2 billion live in extreme poverty , 2.6 billion lack access to clean drinking water and sanitation , and almost three billion burn harmful materials inside their homes to keep warm . 
Each year , ten million people die from infectious diseases like malaria , HIV , and tuberculosis , along with pneumonia and diarrhea . 
Lack of water and sanitation is estimated to cause at least 300,000 deaths each year . 
Poverty is one of the main killers . 
It is why children do not receive proper nutrition and live in neighborhoods with unclean water and inadequate sanitation . 
And it is why an entirely preventable disease like malaria kills 600,000 people each year ; many are too poor to buy drugs and bed nets , while governments are often too poor to eradicate the mosquitos that carry the disease or contain and treat outbreaks when they occurs . 
But some of the most lethal problems are environmental . 
According to the World Health Organization , about seven million deaths each year are caused by air pollution , with the majority a result of burning twigs and dung inside . 
Previous generations &quot; use of lead in paints and gasoline is estimated to cause almost 700,000 deaths annually . 
Ground-level ozone pollution kills more than 150,000 people per year , while global warming causes another 141,000 deaths . 
Naturally occurring radioactive radon that builds up inside homes kills about 100,000 people every year . 
Here , too , poverty plays a disproportionate role . 
No one lights a fire every night inside their house for fun ; they do so because they lack the electricity needed to stay warm and to cook . 
While outdoor air pollution is partly caused by incipient industrialization , this represents a temporary tradeoff for the poor - escaping hunger , infectious disease , and indoor air pollution to be better able to afford food , health care , and education . 
When countries become sufficiently rich , they can afford cleaner technology and begin to enact environmental legislation to reduce outdoor air pollution , as we now see in Mexico City and Santiago , Chile . 
One of the best anti-poverty tools is trade . 
China has lifted 680 million people out of poverty over the past three decades through a strategy of rapid integration into the global economy . 
Extending free trade , especially for agriculture , throughout the developing world is likely the single most important anti-poverty measure that policymakers could implement this decade . 
But it is also encouraging that the world is spending more money to help the world &apos;s poor , with development aid almost doubling in real terms over the past 15 years . 
And , though the data are somewhat inconsistent , it is clear that the world is spending more on the environment . 
Aid for environmental projects has increased from about 5 % of measured bilateral aid in 1980 to almost 30 % today , bringing the annual total to about $ 25 billion . 
That sounds great . 
The world can increasingly focus aid on the main environmental problems - indoor and outdoor air pollution , along with lead and ozone pollution - that cause almost all environment-related deaths . 
Unfortunately , that is not happening . 
Almost all environmental aid - about $ 21.5 billion , according to the OECD - is spent on climate change . 
There is no doubt that global warming is a problem that we should tackle smartly ( though our track record so far has not been encouraging ) . 
But doing so requires cheap green energy , especially in the developed world , not spending aid money to reduce developing countries &quot; emissions of greenhouse gases like CO ₂ . 
Indeed , there is something fundamentally immoral about the way we set our priorities . 
The OECD estimates that the world spends at least $ 11 billion of total development money just to cut greenhouse-gas emissions . 
A large part of this is through renewable power like wind , hydro , and solar . 
For example , Japan recently granted $ 300 million of its development aid to subsidize solar and wind power in India . 
If all $ 11 billion were spent on solar and wind in the same proportion as current global spending , global CO ₂ emissions would fall by about 50 million tons each year . 
Run on a standard climate model , this would reduce temperatures so trivially - about 0.00002oC in the year 2100 - that it is the equivalent of postponing global warming by the end of the century by a bit more than seven hours . 
Of course , climate campaigners might point out that the solar panels and wind turbines will give electricity - albeit intermittently - to about 22 million people . 
But if that same money were used for gas electrification , we could lift almost 100 million people out of darkness and poverty . 
Moreover , that $ 11 billion could be used to address even more pressing issues . 
Calculations from the Copenhagen Consensus show that it could save almost three million lives each year if directed toward preventing malaria and tuberculosis , and increasing childhood immunization . 
It could also be used to increase agricultural productivity , saving 200 million from starvation in the long run , while ameliorating natural disasters through early-warning systems . 
And there would be money left over to help develop an HIV vaccine , deliver drugs to treat heart attacks , provide a Hepatitis B vaccine to the developing world , and prevent 31 million children from starving each year . 
Is it really better to postpone global warming by seven hours ? 
Even if we continue spending $ 11 billion to avoid an increase in greenhouse gases for a hundred years , we would postpone global warming by less than one month by the end of the century - an achievement with no practical impact for anyone on the planet . 
Why does the world consciously choose to help so ineffectively ? 
Could it be that environmental aid is not primarily about helping the world , but about making us feel better about ourselves ?
