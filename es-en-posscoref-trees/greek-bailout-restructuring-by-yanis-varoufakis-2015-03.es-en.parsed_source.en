Deescalating Europe &apos;s Politics of Resentment 
ATHENS - A German television presenter recently broadcast an edited video of me , before I was Greece &apos;s finance minister , giving his country the middle-finger salute . 
The fallout has shown the potential impact of an alleged gesture , especially in troubled times . 
Indeed , the kerfuffle sparked by the broadcast would not have happened before the 2008 financial crisis , which exposed the flaws in Europe &apos;s monetary union and turned proud countries against one another . 
When , in early 2010 , Greece &apos;s government could no longer service its debts to French , German , and Greek banks , I campaigned against its quest for an enormous new loan from Europe &apos;s taxpayers to pay off those debts . 
I gave three reasons . 
First , the new loans did not represent a bailout for Greece so much as a cynical transfer of private losses from the banks &quot; books onto the shoulders of Greece &apos;s most vulnerable citizens . 
How many of Europe &apos;s taxpayers , who have footed the bill for these loans , know that more than 90 % of the â‚¬ 240 billion ( $ 260 billion ) that Greece borrowed went to financial institutions , not to the Greek state or its people ? 
Second , it was obvious that if Greece already could not repay its existing loans , the austerity conditions on which the &quot; bailouts &quot; were premised would crush Greek nominal incomes , making the national debt even less sustainable . 
When Greeks could no longer make payments on their mountainous debts , German and other European taxpayers would have to step in again . 
( Wealthy Greeks , of course , had already shifted their deposits to financial centers like Frankfurt and London . ) 
Finally , misleading peoples and parliaments by presenting a bank bailout as an act of &quot; solidarity , &quot; while failing to help ordinary Greeks - indeed , setting them up to place an even heavier burden on Germans - was destined to undermine cohesion within the eurozone . 
Germans turned against Greeks ; 
The fact is that Greece had no right to borrow from German - or any other European - taxpayers at a time when its public debt was unsustainable . 
Before Greece took any loans , it should have initiated debt restructuring and undergone a partial default on debt owed to its private-sector creditors . 
Similarly , European citizens should have demanded that their governments refuse even to consider transferring private losses to them . 
The result was the largest taxpayer-backed loan in history , provided on the condition that Greece pursue such strict austerity that its citizens have lost one-quarter of their incomes , making it impossible to repay private or public debts . 
The ensuing - and ongoing - humanitarian crisis has been tragic . 
Five years after the first bailout was issued , Greece remains in crisis . 
Animosity among Europeans is at an all-time high , with Greeks and Germans , in particular , having descended to the point of moral grandstanding , mutual finger-pointing , and open antagonism . 
This toxic blame game benefits only Europe &apos;s enemies . 
It has to stop . 
Only then can Greece - with the support of its European partners , who share an interest in its economic recovery - focus on implementing effective reforms and growth-enhancing policies . 
In practical terms , the February 20 Eurogroup agreement , which provided a four-month extension for loan repayments , offers an important opportunity for progress . 
As Greece &apos;s leaders urged at an informal meeting in Brussels last week , it should be implemented immediately . 
In the longer term , European leaders must work together to redesign the monetary union so that it supports shared prosperity , rather than fueling mutual resentment . 
But , with a strong sense of purpose , a united approach , and perhaps a positive gesture or two , it can be accomplished .
