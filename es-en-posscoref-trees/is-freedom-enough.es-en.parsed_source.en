Is Freedom Enough ? 
Do democracies need values ? 
The question seems absurd in the light of photographs of American soldiers torturing and humiliating Iraqi prisoners . 
But the fact is that the advance of democracy historically entailed the erosion of shared values and the rise of individual autonomy . 
It presupposed moral agnosticism and a plurality of meanings , none of which are sacred or compulsory to all . 
Democracy does nurture some common values , but they are overwhelmingly liberal values - in other words , individual rights trump collective obligations . 
For contemporary democrats , the fullest possible respect for the autonomous individual is , as Thomas Jefferson put it , &quot; self-evident . &quot; 
But are civil , political , and human rights enough to ensure the strength and survival of democracies ? 
Are today &apos;s democracies virtuous enough to rally the energies - including self-sacrifice - needed to defeat their enemies ? 
Such questions were never so urgent in the past , partly because fundamental democratic values were less abstract than they seem nowadays . 
Such values animated the fight against Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism , fascism , and military dictatorship ; in their name , decolonization was achieved , and minorities gained equality and dignity . 
Democracy &apos;s values may be one-sided on behalf of individual rights , but this has also made them universal , legitimizing the struggle against oppression , wherever it is played out . 
But in the world &apos;s most advanced countries , the promise of material prosperity that freedom made possible has long since replaced attention to and defense of fundamental democratic values as the cement of society . 
Western citizens do not rush to emulate the freedom fighters who built their world , despite celebrations , memorials , and the persistence of oppression . 
The September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the United States allegedly changed everything - not only international relations , but the balance between rights and obligations that we long took for granted . 
In fact , the attacks , while surprising in their method , symbolic character , and scope , changed nothing . 
By themselves , they merely revealed the urgency of a fundamental reappraisal that has long been necessary . 
What is the Western model of democratic development really worth ? 
Some non-democratic systems seem to evoke deeper support , because they are based on religious or national communal solidarity , and because closed societies minimize doubt , drift , and criticism . 
Beyond fundamental freedoms and economic prosperity , do we have a specific civilization to defend ? 
Ours is a civilization that accepts selfishness towards one &apos;s own family and group ; that tolerates , with few exceptions , autonomy in moral matters ; and that considers blasphemy , criticism of authority , and even civil disobedience fundamental freedoms . 
Our civilization , despite its drugs , prostitution , alcoholism , incivility , and vandalism , will always be better than rule by Mullahs or soldiers , because its social problems can be allayed , if never entirely eliminated , without changing the foundations of the regime . 
This is not true of totalitarian or fundamentalist regimes , because , to foster free societies , they must be deposed . 
But if our civilization is worth defending , why is it that fundamentalists , of whatever stripe , have the most committed fighters on their side ? 
Can we oppose them with anything but individual rights ? 
Two opposite temptations must be resisted . 
The first temptation , characteristic of frightened societies , is a rush to embrace so-called &quot; traditional &quot; values , with their implications of withdrawal , closure , intolerance , and even hatred . 
The second temptation is a purely military policy that fixates on physical strength without considering how to project greater credibility and fairness . 
Of course , when enemies are already attacking , one cannot afford to ask too many questions . 
But when enemies are merely threatening , it is better first to assert legitimacy , and thus acquire some credibility at home and abroad . 
To do so , there cannot be too wide a gap between our stated principles and our actual behavior . 
Nor can we claim , as we used to , that our values spring from God , nature , reason , or historical laws . 
Our values reflect the democratic debate itself , nothing more , and our defense of them must address three related fields . 
First , we must update our social contract . 
France &apos;s ongoing public debate about secularism and legislation is an important effort in this direction , even if the debate could be better organized to demonstrate the link between principles , social and anthropological facts , and public policy . 
Such a debate should also involve education - its rules , objectives , and contents . 
In many countries , however , political parties find it difficult even to contemplate such debates . 
The second axis of values concerns social justice and the environment . 
Issues linked to inequality , the distribution of wealth , and our exploitation of the natural world will become increasingly salient . 
This debate has not happened in the US , despite vague attempts at the beginning of the first Clinton administration ; it has barely begun with Tony Blair &apos;s &quot; Third Way &quot; in the UK , or with Gerhard Schr√∂der &apos;s variant in Germany . 
In France , the debate has stalled altogether due to bitter distributive conflicts , deep division within the Left , and the Right &apos;s absence of an economic and social vision . 
What remains are the values linked to the global order , defense of which requires leading by example , not by narrow , legalistic initiatives aimed at crisis management or conflict resolution . 
This approach too often sacrifices long-term essential objectives to short-term concerns . 
The fight for democracy cannot be selective . 
A desirable vision for the future of humanity must appeal to universally shared conceptions of justice and equity . 
We must all become freedom fighters .
