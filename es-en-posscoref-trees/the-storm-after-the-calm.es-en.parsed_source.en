The Storm after the Calm 
PARIS - Could the financial crisis of 2007-2008 happen again ? 
Since the crisis erupted , there has been no shortage of opportunities - in the form of inadequate conclusions and decisions by officials - to nurture one &apos;s anxiety about that prospect . 
Over the course of the three G-20 summits held since the crisis , world leaders have agreed to tighten financial regulation slightly , but only for banks , while leaving other market players free of restrictions and scrutiny . 
As was true before the crisis , no one is monitoring the almost limitless &quot; virtual &quot; market for derivatives , where money moves freely without official rules or contact with the real economy . 
And large players have plenty of cash with which to speculate , especially given the United States Federal Reserve &apos;s decision to inundate the world with a sea of liquidity . 
The result has not been investment in productive assets that boost employment in the US , as the Fed intended , but rather a run-up in global commodity prices and a growing bubble in the housing markets of the major emerging economies . 
Simply put , there are no brakes that could stop the global economy from blundering into another financial crisis . 
Tax havens remain numerous , and their regulation anarchic . 
The skimpy enforcement measures undertaken by bank regulators since the crisis are nowhere near appropriate to what is at stake . 
Governments have refused to reinstate the absolute wall of separation between commercial and investment banks , leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay deposit-insurance claims when the bubble-prone financial sector blows up . 
Indeed , it is now clear that governments prevented a full-scale collapse of the financial system in 2008 by transforming toxic private debt into public debt . 
It worked then , but it cannot work now , in large part because it contributed to the new , looming crisis in financial markets brought on by countries &quot; soaring public-debt burdens . 
We cannot blame today &apos;s emerging crisis solely on our current and recent governments &quot; actions . 
For more than 20 years , the world &apos;s major capitalist economies have been led to borrow heavily and unabashedly , in large by a new rule , adopted worldwide beginning in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , that tied monetary policy to targets for price growth . 
This dangerous idea - proposed in France by Jacques Rueff in 1958 , adopted throughout Europe over the following two decades , and extended to the European Central Bank - was intended to limit the tendency of capitalist economies to aggravate inflation as soon as they hit full employment . 
But the rule ultimately had the terrifying result of obliging countries to borrow from private banks at market prices to guarantee their treasuries &quot; integrity . 
With the possible exception of the four Scandinavian countries , no society with a market economy found , or even sought , the equilibrium between state and market necessary to maintain a sufficient level of public services . 
But even institutionalized monetary austerity has not stopped national public-debt levels from reaching 50-100 % of GDP in Europe ( higher in countries Greece and Italy ) and surpassing 100 % in the US . 
Moreover , the 17 European countries that currently use the euro cannot devalue their currency unilaterally . 
The euro is an important collective step forward , but to insure its credibility as a truly common currency , it should be treated as the embodiment of a true and whole-hearted solidarity . 
The German government still does not admit that - as if France before the euro would have offered up Seine-Saint-Denis or Corsica to pay off its foreign debts to keep the franc . 
Greece , a eurozone member , is now in just such an untenable situation . 
If Greece defaults , an enormous amount of speculation will be possible . 
Indeed , financial markets are unlikely to differentiate between Greek debt and that of other heavily indebted economies , including Portugal , Ireland , Spain , and even Italy - the most recent eurozone member to come under speculative attack . 
This could well create a financial tsunami worth trillions of dollars , which explains the energy with which the European Central Bank and its president , Jean-Claude Trichet , have tried to head off the worst . 
Great Britain , Belgium , and even France find themselves at a debt level that does not leave much hope that they will escape unscathed . 
Meanwhile , the US cannot meet its next debt payment unless Congress and the president reach an agreement to raise the national-debt ceiling . 
The consequences of a US default have rightly been described with growing alarm as the risk increases . 
But the necessary financial measures can no longer be implemented while respecting states &quot; traditional and full sovereignty . 
The US must renounce the imperialism of the dollar , and Germany must abandon its dream of a &quot; deutscheuro , &quot; managed as if the other 16 euro members were historical and cultural extensions of the German nation . 
The approaching storm , and the measures that must be taken to address it , will bring enormous change .
