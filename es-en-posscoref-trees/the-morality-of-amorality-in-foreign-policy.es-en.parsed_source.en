The Morality of Amorality in Foreign Policy 
When it comes to morality , diplomats are usually seen as cold and calculating . 
Machiavelli and Metternich are synonymous with the ruthless pursuit of interest verging on dishonesty . 
Sir Henry Wootton , Queen Elizabeth &apos;s Ambassador to Venice and Bohemia , described his profession as being made up of honest gentlemen sent abroad to lie for their countries . 
But good reasons exist for diplomacy &apos;s amoral tradition ; paradoxically , this tradition embodies important moral values . 
Many of us , despite our great respect for the US , react against phrases like &quot; Axis of Evil &quot; not because the countries listed do not present serious challenges , but because of the difficulties that follow from mixing foreign policy and morality . 
&quot; Evil &quot; is a religious term , not a foreign policy principle . 
Foreign policy is about war and peace . 
If wars are fought on moral or religious grounds , no basis for restraint exists . 
After all , to call something evil is to invoke a moral duty to destroy it . 
No compromise , no modus vivendi , no peaceful co-existence is possible . 
Even containment is ruled out , for there is simply no room for negotiation and compromise . 
You cannot do business with the Great Satan . 
Europe twice endured unrestrained wars . 
The Thirty Years War , fought over religion , laid waste to the Continent , killing one-third of Germany &apos;s population . 
Memory of the war &apos;s horrors led to a period of rationalism and restraint in international politics . 
But memories fade . 
In the last hundred years , contests of nationalism ( with God on both sides ) nearly annihilated Europe , and the Cold War could have done so . 
The moment you believe &quot; better dead than Red &quot; you are in trouble . 
Dying to save your home , family , or country may be rational . 
But martyrdom is different and dangerous . 
As the Romanian philosopher E. M. Cioran says : &quot; Once man loses his faculty of indifference he becomes a potential murderer ; once he transforms his idea into a God the consequences are incalculable . &quot; 
The amoral approach has been Europe &apos;s main tradition since the Thirty Years War . 
Its pantheon includes such passionless executors of raison d &apos;Ã©tat as Metternich , Talleyrand , Richelieu , Bismarck , and Kissinger - people who make alliances with morally repugnant partners and then sometimes reverse them at the drop of a hat . 
The objective of amoral foreign policy is to sustain order in an anarchic international system by ensuring tolerance and pluralism among a number of independent actors . 
This is the best way to restrain power in a world where there is no one but us to do so . 
In such a world , interests must come first , because we cannot negotiate about values . 
Naturally , several qualifications apply . 
Tolerance has limits . 
Genocide cannot be defended on the grounds of pluralism . 
There is also an imperative to deal with anyone who threatens the pluralistic nature of the system . 
Second , although an &quot; amoral &quot; international system may be necessary to support pluralism , an individual country &apos;s foreign policy need not be value-free . 
There is also ample scope to decide whether we define our interests broadly or narrowly , and whether we pursue them by negotiation or violence . 
We have choices to make about all our policies , and these choices are not morally indifferent . 
For the most part , there is no such thing as an &quot; objective &quot; national interest . 
Abolition of the slave trade , or the triumph of socialism , or the spread of human rights and democracy can all be deemed a national interest . 
Sometimes countries adopt policies that threaten their survival , conscious that they are doing so . 
Poland and Czechoslovakia reacted differently to the Nazi threat not because their interests were different , but because their people were different . 
How you define your interests reflects how you define your country . 
The Soviet Union and America had similar interests at the end of the Second World War . 
America pursued its interests through openness and multilateral systems . 
The USSR pursued its interests by force , reflecting the brutal nature of its regime . 
Some argue that insisting on amoral diplomatic language is no longer necessary , because human rights are more or less universally accepted , if not always observed . 
But this is true only to a point . 
Globalisation has brought increasing acceptance of common rules and legal norms , but this is not the same thing as universal acceptance of human rights . 
Many countries claim that their law is based on divine authority , say , the Koran , returning us to the bleak potential for unlimited conflicts over values . 
There is also a different order of priorities between weak and strong states . 
In countries where order may break down at any moment , it may not be better - as it is in stable , well ordered countries - to let ten guilty men go free rather than punish one innocent man wrongly . 
In practice , order must be established before it can be limited by the rule of law and international human rights norms . 
Today , the threat of terrorist attack causes people to re-examine human rights and legal standards . 
It may be more important instead to look at the language in which we discuss terrorist incidents . 
At times dialogue with terrorists may be needed ; there may be reason to avoid making this impossible by fixating too rigidly on moral imperatives and condemning all terrorists as unspeakable criminals . 
The case for a morally neutral diplomacy remains more compelling than ever , for on closer inspection , it is also a case in favor a foreign policy based on clear moral values .
