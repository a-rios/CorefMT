The French Reactionary Revolution 
PARIS - The expression &quot; the French exception &quot; applies not only to culinary matters , but to social and economic issues as well . 
A majority of today &apos;s French recognize that raising the retirement age is necessary to ensure the survival of the pension system . 
Yet , according to all public-opinion polls , close to 70 % of the French support the demonstrators who are taking to the streets to block the very modest reforms introduced by President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s government . 
&quot; The French exception &quot; is the product of an encounter between a peculiar political and intellectual history and the rejection of the elites currently in power . 
To the dismay of their European neighbors , and in front of a bemused global public , the French are once again demonstrating their bizarre tradition of using revolutionary means to express extreme conservative leanings . 
Unlike their predecessors in May 1968 , today &apos;s demonstrators are not in the streets to defend a different and better future . 
They are out there in significant numbers to protect the status quo , and to express their nostalgia for the past and their fear of the future . 
And yet the reactionary / revolutionary movement of the type that we are witnessing - a backlash against the inevitable consequences of globalization - remains unmistakably French . 
It is driven by the extreme Cartesian rationality , verging on the absurd , of a country whose citizens continue to view their state in the same way that adolescents view their parents . 
Indeed , to see high school students expressing their hostility to Sarkozy &apos;s planned slight increase in the retirement age is particularly revealing . 
They seem to confirm the &quot; wisdom &quot; of a Chinese student who recently described her life plan to an American magazine : &quot; I will start with a good American university to beef up my education , then I will work in China and become rich , and then I will retire in Europe and enjoy life . &quot; 
If she retires in France , she can live in an ideal place to enjoy the present , not to build a future . 
The protesters know that what they are demanding in the streets today - the maintenance of what they have - is totally unrealistic . 
Yet they find it perfectly legitimate to carry on . 
And what if France really is showing the world what a &quot; good life &quot; is all about ; that life is not about being part of a &quot; Great Nation &quot; with a nuclear bomb and a seat on the United Nations Security Council , but about being a &quot; Happy Nation , &quot; whose citizens understand how to live well and want to enjoy a long &quot; second life &quot; after retirement ? 
France , in this light , becomes , once again , the spearhead of a new European Revolution - a revolution based not on the principles of &quot; Liberté , Egalité , Fraternité , &quot; but on the pleasure principle . 
Such Frenchmen want to lead Europeans in their attempt to become a museum of the good life and concentrate on tourism . 
France must be the model of an alternative ! 
But this ironic vision of today &apos;s France is much too simplistic or romantic , and does not comprehend the combination of fear and social discontent that are now visible in the current French maelstrom . 
In their desperate pursuit of contentment , the French express a profound existential malaise . 
They seem to be asking , &quot; If we can no longer be great , because we have been overtaken by others , can we simply be happy ? &quot; 
But their opposition to change reflects not only a certain denial of reality . 
It also corresponds to a rebuttal of the man who incarnates in their eyes everything they reject . 
Indeed , Sarkozy &apos;s personal unpopularity plays a significant role in the continuing strength of the anti-reform opposition . 
How can a man who represents &quot; big business , &quot; or who simply seems fascinated by money , dare ask them to sacrifice for France ? 
The French passion for equality nowadays far outweighs the French passion for liberty , and thus threatens French prosperity . 
The fate of those who began working at a very early age , or of women who interrupted work to raise their children , is used as an argument against reform . 
The outcome is difficult to predict . 
The battle of wills between Sarkozy and the street is still very much open . 
If I had to bet , I would wager that the government will end up winning this battle . 
But Sarkozy is unlikely to derive long-term political benefit from his modest success , and he will face an uphill battle to be re-elected . 
The French have not yet chosen between defending the old world and facing up to the challenges of a globalized world . 
Their very hesitation is a source of bewilderment for most and a source of admiration for a few . 
In all fairness , it seems easier to explain than to understand their behavior .
