Starved for Science 
AMSTERDAM - In the Mekong Delta , farmers obtain 6-7 tons of rice per hectare in dry seasons and 4-5 tons per hectare in wet seasons , using fast-maturing rice varieties that allow up to three consecutive yields annually . 
By contrast , West African rice farmers harvest only 1.5 tons per hectare of traditional upland rice annually , while other cereals yield no more than one ton - a figure comparable to yields in medieval Europe . 
Such disparities are unnecessary . 
Indeed , the proliferation of agricultural technology - from more efficient machinery to higher-yielding or more robust crop varieties - has the potential to narrow the productivity gap considerably , even if differences between climates and producers remain . 
For example , a new variety of African upland rice , Nerica , triples annual yields . 
Likewise , over the last four decades , improved breeding methods , higher-quality feed , and better veterinary care have more than doubled average milk production worldwide . 
Nevertheless , regional discrepancies remain massive : cows in the Netherlands can produce roughly 9,000 liters of milk annually , while Zebu cattle in the tropics produce only about 300 liters . 
The need to increase agricultural output becomes more urgent every day . 
The global population is set to reach nine billion by 2050 , while people in the developing world - where nearly all of the population growth will occur - are seeking more varied diets . 
By 2030 , demand for animal products will double , with overall food demand rising by 40 % . 
Science has much to contribute to global food security . 
While genetic modification is not essential to feed the world , it does provide significant advantages , enabling scientists to introduce or enhance traits - virus resistance in cassava , for example , or improved digestibility of feed - that cannot be realized with conventional breeding . 
To be sure , raising yields is not the same as feeding the world . 
If a vast swath of the population cannot afford the food that is produced , the size of the yield is irrelevant . 
While nearly one billion people have been lifted out of poverty ( defined by the World Bank as an income of less than $ 1.25 per day , in purchasing-power-parity terms ) in the last 20 years , such progress will prove more difficult for the next billion . 
Given this , policymakers should redouble their efforts to reduce poverty by supporting sustainable and inclusive economic growth . 
They should commit to advancing sound agricultural management , maintaining well-functioning markets , and increasing investment in agriculture . 
At the same time , these objectives , while pressing , should not obscure the need to focus on yields - increases in which have accounted for three-quarters of food-production growth in recent decades . 
Fortunately , the most significant potential limitations - land , water , and nutrients - seem unlikely to constrain global output excessively in the foreseeable future . 
But , while none is in short supply globally , local shortages may occur . 
Although crop land per capita will continue to decline , more arable land is available worldwide than previously thought . 
The example of the use of the Brazilian cerrado , once considered useless , augurs well for the African savannas . 
Underused land reserves also exist elsewhere in South America , Central Asia , and Eastern Europe . 
A more immediate challenge is ensuring that crops receive sufficient water , which requires building and maintaining efficient irrigation systems to stabilize yields and enable farmers to harvest an additional crop each year . 
As it stands , only 4 % of arable land in Sub-Saharan Africa is irrigated , compared to 38 % in Asia . 
While the Middle East will face serious water shortages , Africa , where most population growth is set to occur , contains numerous unexploited water sources . 
Fertilizer use has become significantly more efficient in recent years , a trend that will continue . 
Reserves of minerals like phosphate will remain plentiful in the next decades , and nitrogen is not limited . 
Technology to extract nutrients from waste already exists , reducing dependency on mining . 
Moreover , pigs and poultry are ideal food-waste processors , and their effluents can serve again as nutrient and energy sources , turning future food chains into interconnected production cycles . 
Perhaps the most pressing constraint on agricultural production is the impending labor shortage , as rural young people , who traditionally comprise the agricultural labor force , flock to cities . 
With small farmers unable to provide sufficient surpluses , agricultural production will become increasingly consolidated and mechanized , raising fossil-fuel consumption , which will have to be offset by the introduction of more efficient technologies . 
Of course , future food production is subject to significant uncertainty . 
Population growth may not slow down as rapidly as expected . 
Protectionism threatens open markets and GDP growth . 
And price volatility , whether triggered by drought or short-sighted national policies , could deter investments in agriculture and decrease the poor &apos;s purchasing power . 
Whether climate change will be a source of yield uncertainty in the coming decades remains unclear as well . 
Although precipitation may be affected , higher temperatures would enable agricultural production in colder regions , and CO2 is known to bolster plant growth , even in dry areas . 
In addition , while food hygiene , traceability , and labeling are improving , any amount of negligence when it comes to food safety could have far-reaching consequences in the complex and interconnected global food chain . 
Rising demand for animal products highlights microbiological risks , with animal-welfare measures sometimes creating new hazards . 
For example , open pens for poultry may increase the spread of communicable diseases like avian influenza . 
Despite such risks , the outlook for future food security is promising . 
Our food is safer and our diets are more diverse than ever before ; production methods are becoming increasingly sustainable , clean , and efficient ; and we are constantly becoming better at protecting biodiversity . 
Yet many in Europe and the United States - which have benefited most from agricultural advances - are mistrustful of this progress , viewing scientific advancement and free trade as a dangerous combination . 
To the extent that this perception impedes progress , it is the real threat to global food security .
