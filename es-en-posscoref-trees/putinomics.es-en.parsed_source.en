Putinomics 
WASHINGTON , D.C.  -  
But , while he refuses to spell out his plans for remaining in power once his second term expires next spring , his economic policy is clear . 
The strangest thing about the Duma election was that Putin lost his nerve . 
He over-exposed himself in public appearances that were as aggressive as they were vague in substance . 
He ran against the West and the &quot; chaos &quot; of the 1990 &quot; s , just as he raged against Chechen terrorists in 1999 and against oligarchs in 2003 . 
The Kremlin abandoned democratic procedures , controlling which parties were allowed to run and their candidates , while Putin &apos;s United Russia monopolized media coverage . 
Opposition activists were blocked from most campaigning , and often arrested , while Kremlin-controlled courts denied their complaints . 
People were intimidated into voting for United Russia on a mass scale . 
Independent election monitors were barred . 
As a consequence , the new State Duma has not been elected so much as appointed . 
It lacks legitimacy and its members are unknown . 
His only &quot; mass &quot; meeting in Moscow drew no more than 5,000 people . 
The main questions are how authoritarian he will become , or whether this pathetic campaign will weaken him . 
Putin &apos;s policy is easy to understand if one realizes that he usually does the opposite of what he says . 
In his first term , Putin appeared to be an authoritarian reformer , undertaking substantial market reforms , such as introducing a 13 % flat income tax . 
But in his second term , Putin was simply authoritarian , undertaking no economic or social reforms worth mentioning . 
Putin has established a purely personal dictatorship . 
He rules through the presidential administration and competing secret police forces without ideology or party . 
United Russia is little more than a bunch of state officials . 
He has sapped most power from other state institutions . 
Personal authoritarianism rarely survives its founder . 
Since Putin has created an over-centralized regime that cannot survive without him , he has to stay as president . 
Law is of minimal relevance , as he can always order the Constitutional Court to approve his third term . 
Putin &apos;s regime may be described as a group of clans , consisting of state-dominated corporations , such as Gazprom , Rosneft , Vneshtorgbank , Rosoboronexport , and the Russian Railways , together with the security agencies . 
Putin &apos;s KGB cronies , usually from St. Petersburg , control these institutions , and tap them for huge kickbacks . 
At the same time , Putin has made sure that they all hate one another , so that they need him as arbitrator or godfather . 
In a sensational interview before the election in the Russian newspaper Kommersant , one of these previously unknown KGB managers explained how they use state extortion against private enterprises to accomplish their &quot; velvet re-privatization &quot; through state corporate raiding . 
According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the share of GDP originating in the private sector has declined from 70 % to 65 % under Putin . 
Re-nationalization through extortion is likely to accelerate . 
This re-nationalization has not been justified ideologically , but rather cynically : the purpose is simply to generate corrupt revenues for top Kremlin officials . 
Although corruption has been declining in most of the former Soviet Union , it has surged in Russia since 2004 , becoming more rationalized and concentrated . 
None of Putin &apos;s KGB kingpins has been arrested or even demoted . 
As re-nationalization gained momentum , the public economic rhetoric changed and become statist . 
Putin now favors protectionism , state intervention , and subsidies . 
In this climate , no progressive structural reforms are likely . 
Until recently , Russia has pursued an admirably conservative macroeconomic policy , running up huge budget and current account surpluses . 
It has paid off its foreign debt and built up foreign currency reserves of $ 450 billion . 
Before the Duma election , however , Putin jeopardized this last vestige of responsible economic policy . 
Currently , Russia &apos;s greatest economic concern is growing inflationary pressure , driven especially by food prices . 
Rising food prices are an international phenomenon , and Russia &apos;s inflation is driven by the large current account surpluses and capital inflows . 
Monetary policy has been loose for the last year , and before the Duma election the government started pouring huge sums into pensions and other social welfare transfers . 
Not surprisingly , inflation has shot up from 7 % last spring to 11 % currently , and may reach 15 % in the spring . 
Naturally , monetary and fiscal policy should be tightened , but that is difficult when Putin is trying to placate the population . 
He could liberalize the exchange rate and let it float upwards , but he is not even doing that . 
Instead , using an old Soviet tactic , Putin has imposed informal price controls , which cannot hold for long in a privatized economy . 
Russia &apos;s economic growth is still driven by the sound market reforms undertaken in the 1990 &quot; s and Putin &apos;s first term , together with high oil and gas prices . 
The main question about economic policy in Putin &apos;s third term , then , is how fast it will deteriorate .
