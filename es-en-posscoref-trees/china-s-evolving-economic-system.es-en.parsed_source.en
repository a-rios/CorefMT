China &apos;s Evolving Economic System 
It is generally agreed that China &apos;s impressive economic achievements during the last three decades are largely the result of the radical reform of its economic system . 
While private ownership of firms hardly existed when these reforms started , private firms today account for about 60 % of total production . 
Ownership , however , is only one dimension of an economic system . 
China &apos;s economic system has changed just as drastically in other ways as well . 
Decision-making regarding consumption and production has largely been decentralized to individual households and firms , respectively ; economic incentives , markets , competition , and internationalization have to a considerable extent replaced command , administrative processes , monopoly , and autarky . 
Generally speaking , China &apos;s reform period has been a stark contemporary illustration of the historical lesson that unleashing individual initiative tends to boost economic development . 
How , then , should today &apos;s Chinese economy be characterized ? 
Some observers describe China &apos;s current economic system as &quot; state capitalism &quot; ; others ( including China &apos;s rulers ) call it &quot; market socialism . &quot; 
Both labels mislead . 
One reason is the domination of private firms on the production side . 
Another is the fact that &quot; socialism &quot; usually does not rely upon strong economic incentives and competition , which are the dominant economic factors in today &apos;s China . 
In fact , China is a type of mixed economy , with a number of specific features , some of which favor GDP growth , while others have not dragged down the economy to any considerable extent so far . 
But this situation is likely to change . 
So further reforms will be decisive in determining the Chinese economy &apos;s future performance . 
Although internationalization of the economy has served China well , it is unlikely that the current 35 % share of GDP claimed by exports and the heavy reliance on foreign technology are sustainable in the long run . 
Tension between widespread private ownership of firms and pervasive public ownership of assets is another specific feature of China &apos;s economic system that looks similarly creaky . 
For example , by disfavoring lending to private firms , state-owned banks distort the allocation of resources . 
Chinese agriculture provides another example of tension between private entrepreneurship and public-sector ownership of assets . 
In particular , public ownership of land harms the investment incentives for family farms and reduces their chance of consolidating land holdings in order to exploit economies of scale . 
Reducing this tension over ownership of firms and assets is imperative , because the entry and expansion of small private companies will be increasingly important when China &apos;s domestic markets and domestic innovation need to play a greater role . 
Thus , for China to gain maximum advantage from private entrepreneurship , it is important to continue shifting the share of financial assets and land holdings out of the public sector . 
This would also help address the endemic corruption that is also a specific feature of the Chinese economic system . 
Corruption is difficult to reduce drastically so long as politicians and bureaucrats have much &quot; to sell &quot; to firms and individuals - including rationed loans from public-sector banks and regulatory permits of various types . 
In rural areas , corruption emanates from frequent expropriation of land-lease contracts held by farmers working on collectively owned land , which local officials then turn over to non-agriculture land developers . 
In both cases , reducing corruption will require not only government pep talks against bad ethics , but also institutional reforms , including further deregulation , stronger property rights , and more privately owned assets . 
Free media would also help . 
No doubt , some types of corruption , including &quot; asset stripping &quot; in connection with the privatization of public-sector firms , has speeded up the emergence of a class of private capitalists and entrepreneurs . 
But if corruption becomes a permanent element of China &apos;s economic system , it is likely to both reduce the efficiency of the allocation of resources and damage the legitimacy of private entrepreneurship . 
China also needs to shift from its highly &quot; extensive &quot; ( resource consuming ) growth strategy to a more &quot; intensive &quot; development path . 
Although high growth requires large-scale capital formation , the relation between investment in real capital assets and human capital in China seems to be out of proportion . 
China &apos;s growth would be more efficient if these proportions changed in favor of education , including vocational training , which is very poorly developed . 
Moreover , eliminating today &apos;s vast wastage of natural resources , which underpins exceptionally high levels of pollution , will require a reformed regulatory framework , including higher user prices for energy , raw materials , and environmental resources . 
By shifting to a less resource-dependent development strategy , more resources would be available for improvements in the country &apos;s much neglected social arrangements , particularly among rural citizens and &quot; urban outsiders &quot; ( individuals in informal urban sectors ) . 
This includes addressing China &apos;s patchy arrangements for income security , as well as its unevenly distributed provision of social services , such as health and education , in particular , in rural areas . 
The case for combining further government withdrawal from the production system with more engagement in the social field is compelling . 
China &apos;s leaders seem to be promising this by voicing their concern for domestic entrepreneurship , social arrangements , rural development and environmental protection . 
Only time can tell to what extent , and how fast , such promises will be fulfilled .
