A Flat World and a Round Ball 
With the final stage of the World Cup approaching , now is a good opportunity for a mid-tournament appraisal . 
This year &apos;s Cup , unlike the previous one in Japan and South Korea in 2002 , didn &apos;t witness any real upsets in the first round . 
Switzerland and Australia surprisingly reached the elimination round , and the Asian and African teams disappointed somewhat , with only Ghana advancing . 
There have been just two ugly matches so far , full of fouls , nasty attacks , and unnecessary aggression , as well as numerous yellow and red cards : Italy vs. the US , and Portugal vs. the Netherlands . 
Otherwise , we &apos;re experiencing a wonderful Cup in Germany , in terms of both sportsmanship and the overall atmosphere . 
As for Germany and the Germans , one hardly recognizes one &apos;s own country and people . 
Even Mother Nature has played along . 
After a long winter and a non-existent spring , summer started promptly with the first kick-off - and virtually overnight , Germany has flaunted its sunniest and most delightful side . 
The weather is Mediterranean , and all of a sudden , so are the people . 
The Cup &apos;s organization has been exceptional ( as was to be expected ) , with excellent police work giving hooligans hardly a chance . 
The whole of Germany has been celebrating a never-ending party with guests from all over the world ( which was not expected ) . 
And the German team has put on a wonderful display of heart warming and modern offensive soccer ( which nobody could have expected ! ) . 
More importantly , not only in the German team , but also in the country as a whole , a young , cool , laid-back , and carefree Germany is raising its head - a Germany that is cosmopolitan , friendly , and good-humored . 
Years of bad news appear to have passed the Germans by without a trace . 
Doctors are on strike , taxes are on the rise , the parties in government are mauling each other , and Chancellor Angela Merkel herself proclaimed in a prominent speech that the country is in disastrous shape . 
But the Germans , undaunted by it all , simply keep celebrating one great soccer party with their newfound friends from all over the world . 
The black , red , and gold German tricolor adorns the entire country as never before , but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones . 
In fact , the flags of many nations fly alongside German . 
In Berlin , as in other large German cities , taxis sport the flags of their drivers &quot; home countries - from Angola to Saudi Arabia . 
Fans don not just their nations &quot; flags , but also fantastic costumes evocative of their home countries &quot; colors . 
Flags are flown in hope of victory , but also serve to dry the tears of defeat . 
In short , Germany during the World Cup is reminiscent of a Shakespearean midsummer night &apos;s dream , with a touch of Woodstock to boot . 
Outside the stadiums , public screenings of the games have become joyous mass &quot; happenings . &quot; 
And how is the soccer ? 
This World Cup demonstrates three main developments that the sport has undergone . 
First , Europe and South America are more dominant than four years ago and remain the unchallenged great powers of international soccer . 
So we must hope that the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 will finally bring greater global parity . 
Second , international soccer is witnessing the advent of a new generation . 
Spain , Argentina , and Germany , to name but a few countries , have put forward very young teams that have played an impressive game . 
On the French , English , and Portuguese teams , too , it is the young players that have shone - despite the continuing presence of Zidane , Beckham , and Figo . 
Even the Brazilian squad is looking more aggressive and likely to score with young players like Robinho and Juninho than with their aging champions from 2002 . 
This generational change is accelerated by a third development . 
At the top international level , soccer has become faster and more athletic , and the top teams can shrink space on the field more effectively . 
A team that is unable to keep going at full speed for the full 90 ( or more ) minutes , switch from defense to offense quickly with the whole team , and maintain control of the ball to restrict their opponents &apos; movements won &apos;t stand much of a chance . 
Here , soccer parallels today &apos;s globalized markets , which make similar restructuring of national economies necessary . 
Unlike economic globalization , however , it remains to be seen whether this new , fast-paced style of soccer will prevail ( after all , the young blood of Spain lost to the Old Boys of France ) . 
The sport and its fans will certainly profit if it does . 
For now , we have a World Cup filled with soccer that is being shaped by a new , young generation both on and off the playing field - light-hearted , enthralling , and beautiful to watch . 
Let &apos;s hope that when the last whistle blows at the final in Berlin on July 9 , we Germans retain as much of this positive spirit as possible . 
Germany urgently needs this kind of optimism , because , unfortunately , two universal principles will continue to apply in the future : first , the winter will return , and , second , the ball is round and the next game is always the most difficult .
