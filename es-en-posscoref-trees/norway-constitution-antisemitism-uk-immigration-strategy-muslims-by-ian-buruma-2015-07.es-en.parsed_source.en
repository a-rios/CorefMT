Good People , Bad Judgments 
NEW YORK - Vidkun Quisling , Norway &apos;s wartime fascist leader whose name has become synonymous with collaboration with evil , lived with his wife in a rather grandiose villa outside of Oslo . 
That villa is now the Norwegian Center for Studies of the Holocaust and Religious Minorities , a fine transformation of a tainted place . 
Earlier this year , I visited the center for a fascinating exhibition on the first independent Norwegian constitution promulgated in 1814 . 
It was a remarkably enlightened and progressive document , composed by learned scholars , steeped in history , law , and philosophy . 
Some were experts on the Greek classics , others on ancient Hebrew ; all were keen readers of Kant and Voltaire . 
There is , however , one extraordinary clause : Article II proclaims freedom of religion in the Lutheran state , with the caveat that &quot; Jews shall still be banned from entering the Realm . &quot; 
This was peculiar , even at the time . 
Napoleon , defeated in that same year , had secured civil rights for Jews in the countries he had conquered . 
And just before the clause entered Norwegian law , the King of Denmark had granted citizenship to Jews in his realm . 
What is most interesting about Norway &apos;s 1814 constitution is not that it contains this clause , but why . 
The stated motives of the intellectuals who created it were not racist ; they did not assume Jews to be biologically inferior . 
Rather , the question was argued in terms of culture and faith , with Jewish beliefs and customs deemed incompatible with modern , enlightened Western values . 
One of the writers of the constitution , Frederik Motzfeldt , argued that Jews would never assimilate themselves with the people of any country . 
Another asserted that Judaism encourages its followers to deceive Christians and other Gentiles . 
Jews , it was believed , would always form a &quot; state within a state . &quot; 
The constitution &apos;s writers were undoubtedly aware that Jews had long been persecuted in other countries , but they concluded that it was not Norway &apos;s problem . 
For Norway , it was best not to let them become citizens at all . 
Experts in Hebrew culture explained that Judaism and Norway &apos;s constitution were irreconcilable . 
Mosaic law was , so the experts said , the only constitution recognized by Jews , and so it should be feared , in the way modern critics of Islam fear Sharia law . 
So the main issue was religion , not race - though the two could easily be confused . 
As HÃ¥kon Harket , the greatest Norwegian scholar on the subject of the anti-Jewish clause , explains : &quot; Even those who fought for civil rights for the Jews held often an ambition to liberate Jews from Judaism . &quot; 
The parallels with current notions about Muslims and Islam hardly need to be pointed out . 
Now , too , the Enlightenment is often invoked as shorthand for the Western values that are supposedly in danger of &quot; Islamization . &quot; 
Now , too , people warn of Muslim tricksters , states within states , the impossibility of assimilation , and the necessity for staunch secularists to free the benighted Muslims from their faith . 
To be sure , in 1814 , there was no Jewish equivalent of the violent Jihadism that poisons relations with Muslims in the West today . 
Nonetheless , there are lessons to be learned from the Norwegian constitution &apos;s misguided anti-Jewish clause , which , it should be noted , was repealed just a few decades later . 
Bad judgment can arise even from decent motives , and knowledge ( of Islam or of Judaism ) is no prophylactic against stupid ideas . 
The most important lesson , however , is that it is always foolish - and , indeed , dangerous - to judge people by what we think they believe . 
To assume that all Muslims think alike because of their religious background , that they have &quot; a mind &quot; rather than individual thoughts , is as big a mistake as to assume to know the minds of Jews , Christians , or anyone else . 
And to claim that something as diverse , and sometimes vague , as a religious faith can be pinned to a fixed ideological position , because of certain ancient texts , is utterly misleading . 
There are populist demagogues in the West who would ban the Koran and prohibit Muslims from immigrating to their countries . 
They have a following , which might be growing , fueled by the widespread anxiety about terrorism spilling over from the Middle East . 
But they are not yet in the majority , and the belief that the West is in imminent danger of being &quot; Arabized &quot; or &quot; Islamized &quot; is not quite yet mainstream . 
Yet even mainstream politicians , sometimes for the best of reasons , are in danger of making the same kinds of mistakes as the members of the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron , for example , is aiming to crack down on Islamist extremism by banning the expression of ideas that the government deems to be promoting or glorifying it . 
People who &quot; reject our values &quot; will be prosecuted , he has declared , &quot; whether they are violent in their means or not . &quot; 
Cameron is not a known racist , or a bigot . 
He is attempting to tackle a real problem : the promotion of violent extremist ideologies . 
But , while people should certainly be punished for acts of violence , going after people purely for what they think - or , worse , what we think they think - has the air of a witch-hunt . 
Cameron is right : &quot; key values &quot; like &quot; democracy and tolerance &quot; are fine things , and they ought to be defended . 
But it is hard to see how banning ideas , or penalizing those who do nothing more than express them , is the best way to do so .
