Choosing Mr. Europe 
BRUSSELS - America &apos;s riveting presidential election campaign may be garnering all the headlines , but a leadership struggle is also underway in Europe . 
Right now , all eyes are on the undeclared frontrunners to become the first appointed president of the European Council . 
Nobody - not even people closely involved in the process - really knows how the European Union &apos;s leaders are chosen . 
There are no formal rules , much less elections ; somehow , names just surface in the media to become part of the EU &apos;s mysterious internal bargaining system . 
In fact , there are five jobs up for grabs , so a complex but secretive discussion is being conducted between Europe &apos;s chancelleries over who might do what without disturbing the delicate balances between political families or between large and small states . 
At the heart of this process is the even touchier issue of whether the people who will take charge of the EU &apos;s main institutions should be strong leaders . 
In principle , everyone wants heavy-hitters ; in practice , many national leaders resist the idea of a more independent and assertive team in Brussels . 
The dilemma is neatly summed-up by the two clear candidates for the top job as &quot; Mr. Europe . &quot; 
On the one hand , there &apos;s the safe pair of hands personified by Jean-Claude Juncker , the veteran prime minister of tiny Luxembourg , who knows the ins and outs of the EU &apos;s political machinery and chairs the euro zone &apos;s ministerial set-up . 
He won &apos;t make waves , but he won &apos;t make headlines either . 
Then there &apos;s Tony Blair . 
World famous but controversial , Blair is capable of rallying public opinion and giving the European project the high profile that the EU craves . 
But he &apos;s also liable to turn a 30-month ceremonial post as the EU &apos;s figurehead into one with much more political clout than its 27 national leaders might like . 
The other four posts will probably be decided as part of a package deal , owing to the need to achieve some sort of balance . 
First , there &apos;s the question of whether the European Commission &apos;s current president , former Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Manuel Barroso , should get another five-year term . 
His early promise to be the EU executive body &apos;s new broom has turned into a steady-as-she-goes captaincy , and there &apos;s the added question of whether his re-appointment might turn the job into a standard 10-year post for his successors , regardless of their abilities . 
The choice for No. 3 job - the foreign policy supremo who will have extra resources and powers to build on the position created by Javier Solana - looks more straightforward . 
Solana , the soft- spoken Spaniard who was previously NATO &apos;s secretary-general , looks like the odds-on favorite to take the new job for a few months before handing it over to Carl Bildt , the Swedish foreign minister and ex-premier who gained international stature in the Balkans in the 1990 &quot; s . 
But nothing is certain . 
If Denmark &apos;s prime minister , Anders Fogh Rasmussen were to succeed as a compromise candidate between Juncker and Blair , as is widely suggested , the presence of two center-right Scandinavians would present a problem . 
The remaining two posts , president of the European Parliament and the &quot; Mr. Euro &quot; job currently held by Juncker , will also have to contribute to overall balance and reflect the outcome of the European Parliament elections in mid-2009 . 
The parliament is a further wild card in this wholly undemocratic and unpredictable process . 
Under the Reform Treaty - the look-alike successor to the controversial European constitution that creates the post of EU president - the parliament &apos;s 785 members will also have their say . 
In years past , only governments could torpedo candidates for Europe &apos;s top jobs , but now the parliament also will be able to reject them . 
It &apos;s not at all clear which will have the greater power to decide the outcome . 
This uncertainty is beginning to focus attention on the fundamental question of whether the EU can continue to choose its leaders in such a strange and furtive manner . 
When the Union was smaller and more modest , inter-governmental horse-trading seemed acceptable , not least because national politicians could downplay the importance of &quot; Europe . &quot; 
Today , with the EU eager to play a forceful role on the world stage , a move towards a more open system appears to be inevitable . The EU &apos;s interlocutors in Washington , Beijing , and elsewhere already make it plain that national leaders claiming to speak for Europe lack credibility , as do EU leaders who so evidently have no convincing political mandate . 
Two clearly defined schools of thought are emerging . 
There are those who argue that these are sensitive and complicated issues beyond most voters &quot; understanding , and that more democracy would result in either populism or embarrassingly widespread abstentions . 
Others believe the EU cannot continue being run along the same lines as in Beijing or even Pyongyang . It &apos;s an issue that will confront any new team chosen by the old methods .
