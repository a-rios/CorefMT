Fiscal Challenges and Fiscal Follies 
BERKELEY - Where is America &apos;s economy headed in 2013 ? 
Will the recovery continue at its frustratingly slow pace ? 
Or will it accelerate as the housing sector rebounds , bank lending expands , household balance sheets improve , and state and local government budgets strengthen ? 
With economic headwinds dissipating , the United States &quot; prospects for faster GDP growth appear promising . 
But there is also a significant risk that a large and unnecessary dose of fiscal austerity will weaken demand , undermine confidence , and tip the economy back into recession . 
Since 2010 , annual GDP growth has averaged about 2.1 % , less than half the average of recoveries from previous US recessions over the last 60 years . 
Slow GDP growth has meant slow employment growth . 
The unemployment rate remains about two percentage points higher than what most economists consider consistent with a full recovery , and the labor-force participation rate is hovering near historic lows . 
The economy is still operating far below its potential : GDP is about 6 % below what the economy is capable of producing at full capacity without higher inflation . 
Tepid growth reflects weak demand . 
Housing prices are rising , and , while residential investment is increasing , it remains depressed as a share of GDP . 
Households have cut their debt and rebuilt their balance sheets , but the large loss in household wealth , weak growth in wages and income , the concentration of most income gains at the top , and a decline in labor &apos;s share of national income to record lows continue to constrain consumption . 
Under these circumstances , and with inflation subdued and interest rates on US Treasury securities far below their historical average in both nominal and real terms , the economic case for temporary fiscal measures to boost demand is compelling . 
Yet the US Congress , spearheaded by Republicans in the House of Representatives , appears to be heading in the opposite direction , so far failing to agree on a deal to protect the economy from much , if not all , of the $ 600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts - the so-called fiscal cliff - scheduled to take effect in 2013 . 
Confusion , fear , ideology , and electoral self-interest all play a role in the readiness of many members of Congress - despite warnings from the Federal Reserve , the Congressional Budget Office , and most private forecasters - to make such an egregious mistake . 
First , confusion . 
The US faces two distinct fiscal challenges : the tax increases and spending cuts that threaten to derail the economy in 2013 ; and a long-term structural deficit that is likely to mean higher interest rates , less investment , and slower growth once the economy has recovered and the output gap has disappeared . 
Unlike the fiscal cliff , the structural deficit problem is not imminent : contrary to deficit hawks &quot; dire warnings , the US does not face a time-sensitive debt crisis . 
Although US federal debt is projected to rise at an unsustainable rate in the long term , the right solution is not fiscal belt-tightening now , but rather a credible plan to stabilize the debt / GDP ratio gradually as the economy recovers . 
Indeed , as Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke recently observed , preventing a severe fiscal contraction in 2013 will boost growth , reduce the near-term deficit , and help to solve the long-term debt problem . 
Second , fear . 
The US government currently can borrow at historically low interest rates . 
As a result of the financial crisis , more risk-averse investors at home and abroad have increased their demand for US Treasury securities . 
But what if investors lose confidence in the US government &apos;s ability or willingness to tackle its long-term debt problem and begin to fear a default ( either explicit or through rapid inflation ) ? 
The result could be a speculative attack by &quot; bond-market vigilantes , &quot; triggering a sharp rise in interest rates , a dramatic fall in the dollar , or a combination of the two . 
For three years , repeated warnings that such an attack is imminent have flown in the face of the evidence : US Treasury securities remain a safe-haven asset for global investors , including risk-sensitive foreign central banks . 
Indeed , global investors ignored Standard 
Poor &apos;s 2011 decision to downgrade US government debt , driving down yields even further . 
Of course , Congress could spook investors and increase the likelihood of a bond-market attack by failing to raise the debt ceiling in 2013 . 
But , absent that monumental folly , long-term interest rates are unlikely to rise significantly as long as the Fed keeps short-term interest rates low - which it recently committed to do until unemployment falls to 6.5 % . 
Congress thus has adequate time to develop a sensible long-term plan to stabilize the debt without endangering the recovery . 
Third , ideology . 
Some members of Congress are unwilling to vote for any tax increase , even as part of a compromise to avert the fiscal cliff or to stabilize the debt . 
More than 90 % of House Republicans have signed a &quot; no-tax pledge . &quot; 
Other members champion the cause of a much smaller government and welcome the deep spending cuts that are scheduled to take effect in 2013 , even if they trigger a recession . 
For such members , ideological purity trumps economic logic . 
Finally , electoral self-interest . 
The primary motivation of most members of Congress has always been winning elections . 
But how this motivation affects their willingness to compromise has changed as a result of redistricting and the growing polarization of voting districts along partisan lines . 
According to a recent analysis by Nate Silver , most House members now come from &quot; hyperpartisan &quot; districts in which the risk of losing to candidates from the other party is small . 
In such districts , members have little incentive to compromise on bipartisan deals to address the country &apos;s fiscal challenges , because failure to do so poses no threat to their re-election . 
On the contrary , especially for Republicans from districts with a strong , ideologically motivated base , voting for such deals could trigger a primary electoral challenge from within their own party . 
It was such self-interested Republican members who rebuffed Speaker of the House John Boehner &apos;s proposal to maintain current tax rates for all but those earning more than $ 1 million per year . 
The outlook for the US economy over the next few years hinges on what a deeply divided Congress decides . 
Right now , the prospect that they will make the right choices appears to be dim . 
Let &apos;s hope the odds improve in the New Year .
