The Global Indian 
KOCHI , INDIA - No other country has anything like it - an annual jamboree of its diaspora , conducted with great fanfare by its government . 
India has been doing it , with great success , for a decade , timed to recall the return to India of the most famous Indian expatriate of them all , Mahatma Gandhi , who alighted from his South African ship in Bombay on January 9 , 1915 . 
As I write , the southern port city of Kochi is overflowing with expatriate Indians celebrating their connection to their motherland . 
India is the only country that has an official acronym for its expatriates - NRIs , or &quot; Non-Resident Indians . &quot; 
In my book India : From Midnight to the Millennium , I suggested , only half-jokingly , that the question is whether NRI should stand for &quot; Not Really Indian &quot; or &quot; Never Relinquished India . &quot; 
Of course , the nearly 25 million people of Indian descent who live abroad fall into both categories . 
But the 1,600 delegates who flocked to Kochi from 61 countries for the eleventh Pravasi Bharatiya Divas ( Expatriate Indians &quot; Day ) celebrations this month were firmly in the latter camp . 
They were in India to affirm their claim to it . 
It was curiously appropriate that the event , organized by the Ministry for Overseas Indian Affairs ( another unique Indian creation ) in cooperation with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry , took place in Kochi this year . 
After all , though the state of Kerala contains just 3 % of the country &apos;s population , it accounts for the largest number of Indians living and working abroad . 
And what a collection the delegates make : the President of Mauritius , the former Governor-General of New Zealand , former Prime Ministers of Fiji and Guyana , Malaysian politicians , Gulf-based entrepreneurs , tycoons from Hong Kong , and corporate titans from the United States , all united by the simple fact of shared heritage - the undeniable reality that even exiles cannot escape the mirror . 
As Prime Minister Manmohan Singh put it in his inaugural address , they were united , too , by an &quot; idea of Indianness . &quot; 
Indianness embodies the diversity and pluralism of both the country and its diaspora . 
India was again using the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas celebrations to provide Indians - including former Indians - from all corners of the world the assurance that they were indeed at home . 
There have been four waves of Indian emigration . 
The first , in pre-colonial times , included those who left as travelers , teachers , and traders ; the second involved the forced migration of Indian labor as indentured servants of the British Empire ; the third was the tragic displacement of millions by the horrors of Partition ; and now we have the contemporary phenomenon of skilled Indians seeking new challenges and opportunities in our globalized world . 
I would probably divide the fourth wave further into two distinct categories : highly educated Indians , often staying on after studies abroad in places like the US ; and more modestly qualified ( but often harder-working ) migrants , from taxi drivers to shop assistants , who generally see their migration as temporary and who remit a larger share of their income to India than their higher-earning counterparts do . 
But both sets of fourth-wave migrants remain closely connected to their motherland . 
The ease of communications and travel today enables expatriates to be engaged with India in a way that was simply not available to the plantation worker in Mauritius or Guyana a century ago . 
To tap into this sense of allegiance and loyalty through an organized public gathering was an inspired idea , which India continues to build upon each year . 
India regards its successful expatriates as a source of pride , support , and investment . 
According to a recent US survey , Indian-American households &quot; median annual income is nearly $ 88,000 , more than $ 12,000 higher than Japanese-American households and more than $ 20,000 higher than the national average . 
That kind of success is not merely at the elite end of the scale : in England today , Indian restaurants employ more people than the steel , coal , and shipbuilding industries combined . 
( Many are the ways in which the Empire can strike back . ) 
The presence of successful and influential Indians in so many countries is also a source of direct support for India , as they influence not just popular attitudes , but also government policies , to the benefit of India . 
The country also received $ 70 billion in remittances last year - more than double the level of inward foreign direct investment . 
There is undoubtedly a utilitarian aspect to the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas celebrations , as suggested by the many parallel seminars being run by state governments to attract expatriate investment . 
The importance of diaspora financing - from the remittances of working-class Indians that have transformed Kerala &apos;s countryside to the millions poured into high-tech businesses in Bangalore or Gurgaon by Silicon Valley investors - simply cannot be minimized , especially during a global financial crisis . 
But we should not get carried away : overseas Indians still invest a lower proportion of their resources in India than overseas Chinese do in China . 
Encouraging them to do more , and giving them reasons to do more , is certainly a worthwhile task for the Indian government - and an overt goal of the annual conclave . 
Sometimes the real value of a conference , however , lies in the conferring . 
Indians have learned to appreciate how much it means to allow NRIs from all over the world the chance to share their experiences , celebrate their commonalities , exchange ideas , and swap business cards . 
Because when India allows its pravasis to feel at home , India itself is strengthened . 
I can think of one more meaning of NRI : the National Reserve of India .
