The New IMF 
WASHINGTON , DC - When Ministers meet for the IMF &apos;s Spring Meeting this month they will find an institution with regained self-confidence . 
The London G20 summit gave a strengthened mandate to the IMF , while tripling its resources . 
More concessional finance will be available for low-income countries , and international liquidity will be increased by a hand-out of $ 250 billion in special drawing rights ( SDRs ) . 
This is a boost for the IMF , and it gives hope to emerging and developing countries that have been severely hit by a crisis that originated elsewhere . 
The IMF is well-positioned to help its members overcome the financing gaps resulting from the crisis . 
In the run-up to the G20 summit access to the Fund &apos;s credit facilities was increased and policy conditions were streamlined . 
In a watershed with former practice , a new non-conditional credit line was introduced for well-performing countries . 
Mexico and Poland will be its first users and more countries will line up . 
These more flexible lending policies reflect a new image of the IMF . 
The negative stigma attached to IMF financing is a thing of the past . 
Its financing role in this crisis secured , the IMF now needs to strengthen its position as guardian of an open international financial system . 
The IMF was created to prevent crises like the current one and in this it has failed . 
Admittedly , there were warnings , but policy makers , particularly in advanced countries , did not follow suit . 
The &quot; new &quot; IMF should be an institution that communicates better with its members , balances the interests of its advanced , emerging and developing members in an evenhanded manner , and aligns its policies better to the needs of the moment . 
Now that the IMF has been given a second lifetime , it needs to regain its central position in the international financial system . 
For this , it needs to focus on three issues : improved surveillance of financial stability , strengthened international coordination , and an updated decision-making process . 
The new IMF needs to become more vocal on global financial stability issues . 
It can help shape a more robust global supervisory system which needs to be built in order to preserve the benefits of global financial markets . 
To this end IMF surveillance should include regular updates on supervisory regimes in systemically important countries . 
Early warnings , commissioned by the G20 , should be specific and the IMF should monitor whether policymakers give follow-up to the Fund &apos;s advice . 
The new IMF needs to take a fresh look at international policy coordination . 
The demand for a different monetary order , as advocated by China , sets the stage for a renewed effort to avoid the international imbalances which were at the root of this crisis . 
First , the US saving deficit will need to be addressed in a sustainable manner . 
Second , China will have to make its currency convertible . 
Third , the position of the euro will strengthen over time as more countries will join the euro zone . 
With more key currencies in place , the perspective of a truly multipolar currency system comes in sight , with an increased role for the SDR . 
Finally , the new IMF needs governance structures that better reflect today &apos;s new global realities . 
The perception that advanced countries are running business in the Fund , but do not adhere to Fund advice , has undermined the IMF &apos;s authority . 
The G20 summit marked the return of the United States to multilateralism . 
This acceptance of collective responsibility should come with abandoning US veto power in the IMF by lowering required voting majorities , as well as abandoning Europe &apos;s prerogative of appointing the Managing Director . 
One of the strengths of the IMF &apos;s present governance structure , the constituency system , should be duplicated at the G20 as well , so as to ensure inclusiveness . 
The rapid growth of China , India , and other emerging countries should come with increased influence , to be implemented through the planned quota increase in 2011 . 
Advanced countries , including European countries , will see a relative decrease in voting power . 
An increased say for emerging economies will imply taking more international responsibility as well , also in financial terms . 
Now European countries finance 42 % of IMF lending and 62 % of concessional World Bank lending . 
This task will have to be shared by emerging countries with large reserves .
