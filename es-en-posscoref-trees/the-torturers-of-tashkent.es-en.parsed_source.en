The Torturers of Tashkent 
NEW YORK - President Islam Karimov &apos;s regime in Uzbekistan has survived for 19 years , in no small part because it has resorted time and again to police brutality and torture to extract confessions from people who have committed no crime , and to break the spirits of political opponents and intimidate anyone who might think of becoming one . 
Sometimes the police are overzealous . 
Sometimes the victims die . 
Sometimes the regime tries to cover up the killings . 
But Karimov has never condemned torture , and he has instituted no measures to prevent it . 
A few cases make it to the public eye , but only when things go too far and victims of brutality or torture die . 
The latest to surface is the case of 30-year-old Muzaffar Tuychiyev , a healthy young man when the police detained him on the evening of March 24 , 2008 , in the region of Tashkent . 
They then transported Tuychiyev to a police station in Angren , 100 kilometers south of the capital . 
By the next morning , Tuychiyev was dead . 
Four police officers are on trial for his killing . 
His parents say higher-ranking officers are going free . 
Talib Yakubov , a human-rights advocate in Uzbekistan , says that torture is an integral part of the Karimov regime &apos;s domestic policy . 
Torture , Yakubov says , enables the government to keep the public in fear and submission . 
The government uses the threat of terrorist attacks to justify domestic repression of political opponents and the absence of democratic reforms . 
But , according to Yakubov , &quot; Only thanks to torture , hundreds and thousands of people admit that they are guilty of religious extremism and terrorism . 
Without torture , none of them would have incriminated themselves . &quot; 
In 2003 , the international community tried to persuade Karimov to publicly denounce torture before an annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) . 
Two months prior to the gathering , a United Nations special reporter published a paper condemning Uzbekistan for &quot; widespread and systematic &quot; use of torture . 
The report unleashed a wave of criticism of the EBRD for choosing to hold its meeting in Tashkent . 
In response , the EBRD promised to pressure Karimov to condemn torture . 
Karimov , not surprisingly , dodged and weaved instead . 
During a speech at the meeting , he boasted that Uzbekistan was a partner of the United States in the war on terror - and for Karimov the war on terror is tantamount to a license to torture in his quest to remain in power . 
On May 13 , 2005 , when government troops in the eastern city of Andijan opened fire from armored personnel carriers on thousands of people demonstrating against poverty and abuse of power , the guns killed hundreds of people . 
Thereafter , torture in Uzbekistan became routine . 
No one has managed to speak to a victim of torture in Uzbekistan . 
Dozens have died as a result of their ordeals . 
Most survivors languish in prison . 
Those who have been released prefer to keep silent about their experiences . 
( Psychological research shows that torture causes serious psychological trauma to its victims , whose families often suffer negative consequences as well . ) 
I had a chance to see one of the victims of Uzbekistan &apos;s regime . 
Rasul Haitov was 27 years old when he was detained in Tashkent with his brother Ravshan , 32 , in October 2001 . 
Police officers resorted to torture to get them to admit that they were members of an Islamist party , Hizb-ut Tahrir . 
The police choked the brothers with plastic bags . 
They drove needles under their fingernails , and then tore them out . 
They sodomized them with glass bottles , beat them up with clubs , and threw their bodies around a room . 
Ravshan died . 
Rasul barely survived . 
When I saw him in a courtroom , he was weak and feeble and looked like a broken old man . 
After two months of treatment , he could still not sit upright .
