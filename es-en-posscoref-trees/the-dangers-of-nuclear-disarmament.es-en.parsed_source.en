The Dangers of Nuclear Disarmament 
MOSCOW - Russia and the United States have signed a new strategic nuclear-arms reduction treaty ( START ) . 
Officially , the treaty cuts their weapons by one-third ; in fact , each party will decommission only several dozen . 
Nevertheless , the treaty is a considerable achievement . 
It normalizes political relations between the two countries , thereby facilitating their further cooperation and rapprochement . 
The return of strategic nuclear weapons to the center of world politics increases Russia &apos;s political weight and highlights the field in which Russia can still assert itself as a superpower . 
It also gives a political boost to Barack Obama , cast as the most constructive and progressive US president for decades , and possibly for many years to come . 
After the treaty was signed , the US hosted a nuclear non-proliferation summit , a landmark event for the Obama administration , which has made the fight against nuclear proliferation a trademark policy . 
The few accords reached at the summit , although welcome , are not as significant as the impression that the summit created that world leaders are ready to work together to confront nuclear proliferation . 
But debates about the role of nuclear weapons in the modern world , as well as in the future , are only beginning . 
The world system on which past discussions of nuclear weapons were based has become almost unrecognizable , calling into question the adequacy of the mentality and concepts inherited from that system . 
The heart of the matter is this : it is obvious that nuclear weapons are immoral . 
An A-bomb is millions of times more immoral than a spear or sword , hundreds of thousands of times more immoral than a rifle , thousands of times more immoral than a machine gun , and hundreds of times more immoral than salvo systems or cluster bombs . 
But nuclear arms also have a significant moral distinction : unlike other weapons , they are an effective means of preventing the large-scale wars and mass destruction of people , property , and cultures that have plagued humanity throughout recorded history . 
To reject nuclear weapons and strive for their elimination is , no doubt , a moral aim , at least in the abstract . 
But it is feasible only if humanity changes . 
Apparently , the advocates of eliminating nuclear weapons believe that such change is possible . 
I do not . 
Indeed , the risks of a world without nuclear weapons - or only a minimal number of them - are tremendous . 
Nuclear deterrence - a threat to kill hundreds of thousands or millions of people - is a concept that does not fit into traditional morals . 
Yet it has worked , preventing catastrophic wars while making people more civilized and cautious . 
When one pole of nuclear deterrence weakened , due to Russia &apos;s political decline in the 1990 &quot; s , NATO , a defensive union of democratic and peaceful states , committed aggression against Yugoslavia . 
Now that Russia has restored its capability , such a move would be unthinkable . 
After Yugoslavia , there was an unprovoked attack on Iraq . 
In a nearly perfect world , Russia and the US would not need large nuclear stockpiles . 
But cutting nuclear weapons to a bare minimum in the current conditions would give a big advantage to small nuclear powers , which will see their nuclear potential gain near-parity with larger states . 
Moreover , reducing nuclear weapons to a minimum might theoretically enhance the usefulness of missile-defense systems and their destabilizing role . 
And even non-strategic missile-defense systems , the deployment of which might be useful , will be questioned . 
If stockpiles of tactical nuclear weapons are reduced , as some US , European , and Russian experts have proposed , the opponents of Russia &apos;s ongoing military reform will have even more reason to object to reconfiguring the country &apos;s conventional armed forces away from confrontation with NATO toward a flexible-response capability vis-Ã -vis other threats . 
Similarly , if the US withdraws its largely nominal tactical nuclear weapons from Europe , US-Europe strategic ties would weaken . 
Many Europeans , above all in the new NATO member-states , would then demand more protection from the mythical Russian Leviathan . 
The world community seems to be losing its strategic bearings . 
Instead of focusing on the real problem , namely the increasingly unstable international order , it is trying to apply Cold War-era concepts of disarmament . 
At best , these are marginally useful ; more often , they are harmful in today &apos;s circumstances . 
What is most needed nowadays is clear thinking about how to live with an expanding club of nuclear states while keeping the world relatively stable . 
To this end , the two great nuclear powers need a coordinated deterrence policy towards new nuclear states . 
Simultaneously , they should offer guarantees to non-nuclear states that might feel insecure . 
In the first place , it is necessary to fill the increasing security vacuum in the Middle East . 
China , the world &apos;s rising strategic player , might join this policy , though it currently ranks third in terms of military power . 
Arms-control talks are mostly needed for rendering national arsenals more transparent , and for building confidence between the great powers . 
That is all there is to their usefulness . 
So , instead of mimicking Cold War-era treaties , it is necessary to launch an international discussion about the role of military force and nuclear weapons in the world as it is now evolving . 
We might then eventually recognize that eliminating nuclear weapons is not just a myth , but a harmful myth , and that nuclear weapons are a useful asset that has saved , and may continue to save , humanity from itself .
