Care-Giving and the Moral Impoverishment of Medicine 
CAMBRIDGE - Care-giving is understood by economists as a &quot; burden , &quot; by clinical psychologists as a &quot; coping process , &quot; by health-services researchers in terms of health-care costs , and by physicians as a matter of clinical competency . 
But , for many people , care-giving is a foundational component of moral experience . 
It is a practice of acknowledgement , empathic imagination , witnessing , responsibility , solidarity , and the most concrete forms of assistance . 
It is this moral aspect that makes care-givers , and at times even care-receivers , feel more &quot; present &quot; - and thus more fully human . 
But , aside from skilled nursing , rehabilitation efforts by occupational and physical therapists , and the practical assistance of social workers and home health aides , care-giving , especially for victims of health catastrophes and end-stage conditions , has relatively little to do with the contemporary practice of medicine . 
To illustrate this point , I draw on my personal experience as the care-giver for my wife , who suffers from a severe neurodegenerative disorder that has impaired her memory and motor functions , restricting her independence . 
I wake her up in the morning , assist her in toileting , bathing , and dressing , make us breakfast , and help her feed herself . 
I assist her in walking , placing her in a chair , and getting into our car . 
I am with her nearly all the time to protect her from injuring herself , because she can neither see nor navigate safely on the street or in our own home . 
It is disturbing to witness the deterioration of a once elegant , intellectually lively , and highly independent companion of more than four decades . 
But our emotional reactions , from frustration and anger to sadness , have been cushioned and sublimated by our work , the long rhythm of our days together , and , above all , by the support of family and close friends . 
That concern and responsibility for us is as much a part of care-giving as all the mundane practices I have listed , and amounts to moral solidarity with our struggle . 
I give you this personal sketch because it is the best I can do to illustrate what care-giving entails , and why it is so crucial to everyone &apos;s life - and to the human condition more generally . 
Care-giving , as illustrated by our case , includes what happens when hope and consolation are abandoned , when theodicy ends , and when all there is to do is to be present with the sufferer , sharing his or her suffering by simply - and usually silently - being there . 
In medical schools , however , the curriculum in both the basic science and clinical apprenticeship years places the greatest emphasis on understanding the biology of disease processes and high-technology treatments . 
The illness experience gets less and less pedagogic attention as the student progresses from classroom to inpatient ward and clinic . 
In the broader system of healthcare , students can readily discern that medicine largely leaves the practical and emotional tasks of care-giving to nurses , social workers , and the patient and his or her network of support . 
The structure of service delivery and the funding of health services work to discourage professionals from the art of care-giving , and can , in fact , undermine the practitioner &apos;s efforts . 
The result is moral impoverishment of the practice of medicine . 
For medical anthropologists , people everywhere live in the flow of interpersonal interactions in local worlds - social networks , families , institutions , and communities . 
That is to say , experience , viewed as the flow of words , movements , and emotions between us , is not only local , but also inherently moral , because living our lives is about animating and enacting values . 
For patients and families faced with health catastrophes and serious chronic medical conditions , the experience of suffering is not just a personal one , but is strongly influenced by cultural and historical changes in the processes that contribute to moral life being distinctive in different eras and societies . 
Faced with a threat of pain , disfigurement , loss of function , and serious disability , individuals and families reframe the experience of suffering within their local moral world by remaking meanings , emotions , and values via ethical , religious , and aesthetic activities . 
Doctors are no different from laypersons in drawing on personal and cultural resources -involving imagination , responsibility , sensibility , insight , and communication - to accomplish their care-giving . 
And what they engage in is an amalgam of ethical , aesthetic , religious , and practical action . 
The physician &apos;s art - now so circumscribed by bureaucratic , political , and economic forces - turns on both the professionalization of these inherently human resources and the impact of their routine use on the doctor &apos;s own moral life . 
To prepare for a career of care-giving , medical students and young doctors clearly require something besides scientific and technological training . 
Indeed , current professional education can even be seen as enabling the physician as a technical expert , while disabling him or her as a care-giver . 
To overcome this trend , we must incorporate the humanities into medical training as a means of rekindling and deepening those human experiences of imagination and commitment that are essential for care-giving , and resisting the bureaucratization of values and emotional responses that causes failure in the physician &apos;s art . 
In essence , the practitioner must come to feel that the art of care-giving is as much at stake as the science and technology of diagnosis and treatment . 
In my view , what is needed is reform of the very culture of contemporary biomedicine . 
We must train students and practitioners in critical self-reflection on that which limits their care-giving ; in strategies and techniques aimed at opening a space for the moral acts of care-giving ; and in the most concrete and practical acts of assistance , so that they never forget what care-giving actually means .
