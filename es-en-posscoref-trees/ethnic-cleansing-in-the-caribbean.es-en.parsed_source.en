Ethnic Cleansing in the Caribbean 
SANTO DOMINGO - I am a native-born citizen of the Dominican Republic . 
I grew up , went to school , started a family , and raised my children on Dominican soil . 
This is the only place I have ever called home . 
Yet , after more than 45 years in this country , my nationality -along with that of thousands of other Dominicans - is being called into question . 
Like many Dominicans , I am of Haitian ancestry . 
My family came to the Dominican Republic from neighboring Haiti to find work . 
Their journey was not uncommon , nor was it discouraged . 
Hundreds of thousands of Haitians came to work in this country with the express permission of the Dominican government . 
But Dominicans like me have always paid a price for our ancestry . 
For more than a century , the government has promoted a policy of state-sponsored racial discrimination . 
We have been used as scapegoats to shift the focus away from the country &apos;s economic and political problems . 
Even so , one lesson I learned growing up was that any person born in the Dominican Republic is a Dominican citizen . 
This no one questioned . 
This no one doubted . 
The Dominican Republic &apos;s constitution says explicitly that anyone born on the country &apos;s territory , except infants born to parents who happen to be diplomats or foreigners &quot; in transit &quot; - understood for decades to mean in the country for fewer than 10 days - is a Dominican citizen . 
Because of this , I never worried that my status as a citizen would ever be in doubt . 
I was wrong . 
Two years ago , my country &apos;s government attempted to strip me of my nationality , and it is now trying to do the same to thousands of other Dominicans of Haitian descent . 
The government launched this effort with a bizarre reinterpretation of the constitution . 
It now deems individuals of Haitian descent born in the Dominican Republic to have no right to Dominican nationality , because their parents or grandparents , many of them residents for years , if not decades , were supposedly &quot; in transit . &quot; 
The government has ordered civil registry officers to refrain from issuing any identity documents for persons who were born to &quot; foreign parents &quot; and received Dominican birth certificates under what the government now calls &quot; irregular circumstances . &quot; 
Moreover , identity documents that the Dominican state already issued are being declared invalid retroactively . 
Only Dominicans of Haitian descent are being singled out . 
The discrimination by my country &apos;s government against my racial and ethnic group is so blatant that some civil registry offices have distributed lists of &quot; Haitian sounding names &quot; so that staff members can recognize them . 
Some people are even singled out based solely on their appearance . 
The crudeness of the government &apos;s campaign would almost be comical if it was not condemning so many Dominicans of Haitian descent to the uncertainty of statelessness . 
Indeed , the implications of losing one &apos;s citizenship are enormous . 
Without identity documents , people are barred from schools , denied health care , prevented from marrying , and refused official documents like birth certificates and driver &apos;s licenses . 
Worse still , the government is considering a constitutional amendment that would permanently strip nationality rights from thousands of Dominican of Haitian descent . 
The situation now is even more dangerous than before . 
For 30 years , I have worked to secure equal human and civil rights for Dominicans of Haitian descent . 
I have encountered many personal and professional difficulties . 
State officials have slandered me . 
Informants have tried to infiltrate my organization and undermine its work . 
I have received death threats on more than one occasion , and my children and I have had to flee our homeland . 
But , despite everything I have endured , I remain hopeful that change is possible . 
Perhaps the campaign against Dominicans of Haitian descent will stop when the Dominican judiciary acknowledges that the retroactive denial of citizenship violates fundamental human rights law . 
Perhaps it will stop when the international community starts speaking out against the Dominican Republic &apos;s discriminatory policies . 
But one thing is certain : it won &apos;t stop until all Dominicans who value democracy and the rule of law stand alongside their fellow citizens and declare that the time for unequal treatment is over .
