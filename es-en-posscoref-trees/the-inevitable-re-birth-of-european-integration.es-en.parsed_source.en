The Inevitable Re-Birth of European Integration 
ATHENS - European integration implies successive transfers of national sovereignty to the Union . 
Typical examples of this are the stalled Lisbon Strategy , the incomplete Economic and Monetary Union , and now , following the Irish public &apos;s blocking maneuver , the uncertain fate of the new EU Constitutional Treaty ( the &quot; Lisbon Treaty &quot; ) . 
A similar weakness is evident in the EU &apos;s attempt to define itself in the global system . 
Energy security , climate change , the rise of China , and the revival of Russia are among the many issues that require effective responses . 
Often , however , the EU cannot respond or can do so only slowly , because its structure obstructs quick decisions and fast action . 
This structure was appropriate in an era when the free market was practically the only issue that the EU had to confront at the global level . 
Change is rendered more difficult by the insufficient democratic legitimacy of EU bodies . 
The lack of a direct relationship with Europe &apos;s people deprives these bodies of the pressure required to bring about rapid action and responsive policies . 
There is no easy solution to these problems . Democracy in the EU cannot be guaranteed by the models and rules that apply in the member states . 
The scale of the problems makes more elaborate solutions necessary . 
When dealing with the EU , member states usually aim for arrangements and regulations that ensure cooperation within agreed-upon frameworks . 
And , as the Irish referendum showed , they do not readily accept unifying initiatives that would make the EU an autonomous center of power . 
But , assuming that the obstacle thrown up by Ireland &apos;s voters can be overcome , experience has shown that the EU &apos;s future evolution will be marked by increasingly centralized power in Brussels and the retreat of individual states . 
The lever for this process will continue to be the EU &apos;s central bureaucracy , the mechanism that formulates the member states &quot; common interests and whose field of action is determined by loose , and periodic , inter-governmental collaboration . 
The more responsibilities the Brussels bureaucracy acquires , the more independent it will become . 
The prime concern for the EU bureaucracy is to find compromises that meet the wishes of member states , and to accommodate often divergent and contradictory national preferences . 
A common will usually emerges without any emphasis on conflicting political tendencies and ambitions . 
In fact , de-politicization is seen to be advisable because it allows for the easy achievement of balances . 
Bolstering democracy , however , requires emphasizing the political dimension and public debate that is free and open to all . 
National forums must make it their concern to discuss common European issues , thereby ensuring information for all , transparency , control , and accountability . 
Instituting public debate on European policy throughout the Union will help clarify the aims of the unification project , make common interests apparent , and determine Europe &apos;s institutional shape . 
This is why the Lisbon Treaty is so important . 
The provisions in the chapter on democratic principles , which concern the EU &apos;s institutions and procedural functions , lay the groundwork for a system that is more open to public debate on EU policies . 
The Lisbon Treaty also succeeds in tackling another major weakness of the EU Â­ - its ineffectiveness . 
By means of extensive reforms to the structure , operation , and decision-making processes of EU institutions , the treaty enhances their effectiveness and enables greater dynamism . 
True , many ordinary Europeans do not think that Europe should play an important part in global developments . 
They believe that foreign policy should be handled by their national governments . 
This view is outdated . 
Even in bilateral or regional crises , viable solutions are possible only at the supranational level . 
The Lisbon Treaty envisages the EU as a highly outward-looking entity on the international stage . 
Indeed , on crucial issues , it is the 27 members , not the Union , that will decide . 
Internally , the treaty takes a big step toward creating a Europe of freedom , security , and justice . 
It both sets the normative framework for EU policy and establishes institutions and procedures for policies on border controls , asylum , reception of migrants , and cooperation between judicial and police authorities . 
Thus , it creates greater security for people in their everyday lives . 
The treaty is less detailed in other areas , particularly in achieving an economic union equivalent to the currency union , because it was simply not possible to reach agreement . 
Nonetheless , the Lisbon Treaty paves the way for planning and implementing policies needed to tackle crucial contemporary challenges , such as climate change , energy , research , technology , and tourism . 
Whatever Irish voters intended by rejecting the treaty , socio-economic change will continue to force the EU to seek new forms of organization , combining inter-governmental and federal approaches . 
For example , the need to adapt the operation of the European Central Bank to a policy of development for Europe , as laid out by the Ecofin Council , is already apparent . 
The EMU is evidence of that . 
More generally , however the problem of the Irish referendum result is addressed , the EU will gradually acquire its definitive shape on the basis of the ongoing problems that it must address , because as the dimensions of these problems grow , their management will require solid and durable forms of cooperation .
