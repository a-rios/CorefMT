Moldova Comes in From the Cold 
CHISINAU - Today , &quot; color revolutions , &quot; which a few years ago were seen as promising developments in the post-Soviet space , seem to be out of fashion . 
Around the world , disappointment with democracy promotion is widespread . 
Instead , consolidation of authoritarian regimes appears to be the prevailing trend . 
Roughly a year ago , Moldova , a country few know about , seemed to confirm this . 
On April 7 , 2009 , Moldova made headlines when peaceful protests against unfair elections were hijacked by a small number of provocateurs who attacked the parliament building and presidential palace . 
The media termed this the &quot; Twitter Revolution , &quot; which was of course an exaggeration . 
Yet one year later , and despite the actions of those provocateurs , a new democratic government is in charge . 
The parliament building is not yet rebuilt , but the government is trying hard to rebuild Moldova as a democratic country with legitimate aspirations to join the European Union . 
The protests of April 2009 were triggered by the Communist Party &apos;s claim to have won a third consecutive term in power , following an aggressive election campaign with widespread abuses . 
The then Communist government cracked down on protesters , leaving at least one person dead , while numerous allegations of widespread torture further traumatized and divided Moldovan society . 
Many in Moldova and Europe believed that another authoritarian state was emerging in the European neighborhood . 
But the country &apos;s democratic forces halted the Communist Party &apos;s attempt to bulldoze its way back into power . 
The Communists needed the vote of just one MP in order to perpetuate their domination of Moldovan politics for another term by electing their president in parliament . 
They failed to get that vote , and early elections were called . 
As a result , a four-party &quot; Alliance for European Integration &quot; came to power last September . 
The Alliance is working hard to consolidate Moldova &apos;s democracy , the rule of law , and economic reform , as well as to press ahead with European integration . 
But there is a difficult legacy to overcome . 
The global economic crisis not only hit the country hard , but , because of irresponsible electioneering , the previous government did not even try to fight it . 
Reckless populist promises left a gaping 16 % -of-GDP budget deficit . 
Fortunately , we managed to avoid economic collapse , thanks to support from the International Monetary Fund , while reducing the deficit by half . 
In late March , Moldova was also promised â‚¬ 1.9 billion by the European Union , the United States , the IMF , the World Bank , and other donors to support a strategy of reforms under the banner &quot; Rethink Moldova . &quot; 
The media are now much freer . 
After eight years of media monopolization , in the last month and a half two new TV channels have been launched . 
Investigations against some of the police and judges responsible for the human rights abuses committed last April have been launched . 
The government is taking quick steps to de-monopolize the economy and break the nexus between economic and political power that characterized the previous government . 
We are also working to improve the business environment and investment climate by cutting red tape and simplifying the administrative burden on foreign investors . 
Relations with the EU have gained significant momentum . 
We are working on a new Association Agreement , which would anchor Moldova in the European space . 
We will also sign a far-reaching free-trade agreement with the EU . 
Such an agreement makes sense because more than 50 % of Moldova &apos;s trade is already with the EU , while roughly 70 % of Moldova &apos;s citizens and virtually all of its political parties support European integration . 
What matters deeply for Moldova &apos;s citizens , though , is to move towards a visa-free regime with the EU . 
We are already working on implementing all the necessary technical conditions . 
From January 1 , 2011 , we will switch to biometric passports . 
Our customs officials and border guards are working actively with an EU mission to modernize our border infrastructure , and we are progressing fast in border demarcation with our only eastern neighbor , Ukraine . 
Moldova will be an increasingly safe neighbor for the EU and a good partner in managing migration flows . 
We have also re-launched settlement talks concerning the breakaway region of Transdniestria , where the only viable basis for a solution is to make Moldova ever more economically and politically attractive to the region &apos;s residents . 
From this perspective , every step that brings us closer to the EU is also a step towards resolving this so-called &quot; frozen conflict &quot; - perhaps the only European secessionist conflict that can be solved through EU soft power alone . 
Moldova &apos;s reemergence from authoritarian rule after eight years is the result of elections and parliamentary procedures . 
This makes Moldova the only post-Soviet state ( aside from the Baltic countries ) with an uninterrupted cycle of transfers of power through elections since 1991 . 
In a sea of pessimism about democracy in the EU &apos;s neighborhood , some winds are still blowing in the right direction .
