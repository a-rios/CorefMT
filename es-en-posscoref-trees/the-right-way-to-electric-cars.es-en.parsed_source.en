The Right Way to Electric Cars 
NEW YORK - Excitement about electric cars abounds nowadays , but consider the number of existing gasoline-powered cars : about 850 million . 
It would take years of new-car sales to make a dent in that number . 
That fact at first depressed Jiri Räsänen , a civil servant in Helsinki - but then it gave him and his friends a good idea . 
Why not keep the cars but replace their engines ? 
That idea would solve a lot of problems , starting not just with today &apos;s installed base of cars , but with the installed base of car makers . 
Even though many of them are in trouble , it &apos;s probably not the best time to start a new car company , either . 
Yet while the market for new cars has slowed dramatically , it could be a good time to start a business replacing gasoline engines with electric ones . 
The group &apos;s initiative , led by Räsänen , is called eCars - Now ! 
A small operation in Finland , it is less a company than a role model for companies that the team hopes will spring up worldwide . 
Borrowing from the open-software movement , Räsänen and his colleagues want to make the idea and the basic designs free , and encourage lots of companies all over the world to implement it locally . 
Some companies will make batteries or electric engines or retrofit kits ; others will retrofit gasoline cars with the new engines - a great job opportunity for unemployed auto workers . 
eCars- Now ! hopes to foster an ecosystem of car service workers and parts makers similar to the ecosystem of open-software programmers and generic computer hardware . 
Of course , the parallels end at some point , because batteries and engines aren &apos;t quite the equivalent of PCs , but the ethos is much the same . 
Räsänen and his team started by measuring the potential demand for electric cars in Finland . 
&quot; No one had done that before in Finland , &quot; he recalls . 
&quot; We decided that if we could get 500 people to show interest in a converted car , we could demonstrate that the mass conversion scheme would make sense . &quot; 
It took eCars - Now ! only 11 days to sign up 500 interested customers . 
To be sure , they merely indicated interest ; they did not send money . 
But the company &apos;s Web site continues to attract new prospects , with 1,000 people now registered as likely or certain to buy such a vehicle . 
The site also solicited advice on which car to convert . 
The Toyota Corolla was the first choice - hardly surprising since it is the leading car model in Finland ( with 7 % of the market ) . 
Just 15 months later , in May of this year , a retrofitted Corolla demo model with an engine from Detroit-based Azure Dynamics was on display at the Electric Vehicle Symposium , a trade show in Stavanger , Norway . 
What will it take to make this idea work ? 
To some extent , it &apos;s already working - by spreading . Local efforts may succeed or fail based on the talents of local implementers . 
In Italy , inventor Roberto Vezzi had a Smart-EV project along the same lines . 
He has now joined the eCars - Now ! movement , and his eSmart car will be upgraded with the open-source graphical user interface being developed for the eCorolla in Finland . 
Other initiatives are springing up in Denmark , Latvia , Spain , and Turkey , says Räsänen . 
The group is now looking for an initial manufacturer / assembler for the retrofit kits ( as opposed to the engines inside them ) . 
In the meantime , eCorolla and the eSmart will go through testing . 
Overall , the economics make sense . 
Produced on an appropriate scale , a kit should cost about $ 20,000 , including distribution costs and a profit margin . 
It should take about eight hours for two workers in a professional garage to install such a kit , or less than a week for the car-owner himself / herself ( or , as they say , two weeks if the owner &apos;s spouse &quot; helps &quot; ) . 
That &apos;s considerably less than the cost of a new car - especially an electric one . 
The real economic benefit , however , is in the cost savings thereafter . 
To be sure , a lot will depend on the availability of convenient charging stations , but they are starting to appear . 
The project is deconstructing the car industry - probably in a more effective way than American government officials are doing in Detroit . 
In Finland , at least , all you need from the government is a certificate of inspection , which costs about € 100 ( $ 135 ) . 
If all goes well , a host of electric car-engine and retrofit kit makers will appear , serving different markets of existing car owners . 
Dealers and mechanics will install the batteries , comprising a new corps of workers devoted ( indirectly ) to cleaning up the environment and adding value to the installed base of cars . 
Any far-sighted government could help not by subsidizing these efforts , but by buying up the old gasoline engines . 
That provides an incentive to retrofitting companies , while competition for customers , rather than for subsidies , will encourage the various providers to be efficient . 
( Many European governments currently have &quot; cash-for-clunker &quot; schemes that buy and destroy old cars ; a cash-for-gas-engines scheme would make more sense by lowering costs and conserving the many car bodies that still work fine . ) 
This project might have seemed quixotic a few years ago , but now it fits the times perfectly . 
It &apos;s modest at a time when the world is in recession . 
It &apos;s energy- and environmentally- friendly at a time when concerns about global warming are growing . 
And it &apos;s distributed , at a time when the world is skeptical of leaders &quot; promises and people are realizing they have to do things for themselves .

There may not yet be a ready-made solution for you unless you live in Finland , but that &apos;s just the point : you can start a local version . 
If you build it , others will come !
