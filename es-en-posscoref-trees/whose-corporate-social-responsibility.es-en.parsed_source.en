Whose Corporate Social Responsibility ? 
NEW YORK - Increasingly , corporations are under pressure , often from activist non-governmental organizations , to take on specific &quot; corporate social responsibility &quot; ( CSR ) obligations . 
CSR can be divided into two categories : what corporations should do ( say , contribute to a women &apos;s rights NGO or build a village school ) and what they should not do ( say , dump mercury into rivers or bury hazardous materials in landfills ) . 
The latter is wholly conventional and subject to regulation ( and recently to questions about how corporations should behave when there are no host-country regulations ) . 
But are CSR obligations really good practice ? 
Milton Friedman and other critics often asked if it was the business of businesses to practice corporate altruism . 
Prior to the rise of the corporation , there were mainly family firms , such as the Rothschilds . 
When they made money , it accrued principally to the family itself . 
Altruism , where it existed , also was undertaken by the family , which decided how and on what to spend its money . 
Whether the firm or its shareholders and other stakeholders spent the money was beside the point . 
With the rise of the business corporation , large family firms have generally disappeared . 
Instead of CSR , we should have PSR ( personal social responsibility ) . 
One can also argue for PSR on the grounds that asking for CSR becomes a way of &quot; passing the buck &quot; - evading personal responsibility for doing good . 
This is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding from spilled coffee - both the subject of lawsuits in recent years . 
There is also an added advantage in replacing CSR with PSR : there is virtue in diversity of approaches to altruism . 
Chairman Mao wanted a hundred flowers to bloom , but only so that he could cut them all off at their roots . 
Moreover , it is hard to see how a corporation &apos;s stakeholders can always arrive democratically at a common position on how the corporation should engage in social responsibility on their behalf . 
Each will consider his or her CSR view the best . 
But there are strong arguments in favor of CSR as well . 
Society increasingly demands that these &quot; corporate citizens &quot; be altruistic , just as people are . 
Given this reality , corporations want to give simply because it is expected of them . 
Such CSR builds the firm &apos;s image as a &quot; good &quot; corporation , just as giving by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet builds their image as &quot; good &quot; billionaires . 
Second , many corporations view CSR as an effective defensive strategy against powerful activist NGOs ( such as Greenpeace ) that have taken to using online agitation , boycotts , and other means to &quot; blackmail &quot; targeted corporations into acceding to the activists &quot; demands . 
The more CSR a company can point to , the less such efforts will succeed - or even be mounted . 
Consider the contrasting experiences of Coke and Pepsi . 
Coke has been targeted by NGOs for alleged lapses in labor and environmental standards . 
By contrast , Pepsi , which once teamed up with AT T and the CIA to oust President Salvador Allende in Chile , smells like a rose nowadays , because it has distributed CSR largesse to several causes that influential NGOs embrace . 
That is a lesson that Wal-Mart has since learned . 
In 2005 , the Service Employees &quot; International Union ( SEIU ) created Wal-Mart Watch , with an annual budget of $ 5 million . 
The purpose was to make Wal-Mart a &quot; better employer , neighbor , and corporate citizen , &quot; and Wal-Mart eventually capitulated on some of the SEIU &apos;s specific demands as well . 
Finally , CSR can be simply a matter of advertising . 
In this case , the choice of CSR spending is focused directly on generating added revenue , much like advertising , and is aimed at sales much the way advertising is . 
A benign example is Adidas &apos;s sponsorship of tennis tournaments . 
A malign example is Philip Morris &apos;s donation of money to museums , symphony orchestras , and opera houses , cynically aimed at buying off artists who might otherwise work to ban cigarettes . 
All these rationales for CSR suggest that it should be left to each corporation to determine , just as PSR leaves altruism to each individual &apos;s conscience and sense of what needs supporting . 
The attempt by some NGOs and activists to impose a straitjacket on CSR , reflecting their priorities , is misguided and must be rejected . 
Instead , the model should be former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan &apos;s initiative , the Global Compact . 
What Annan has done is to embrace ten wide-ranging guiding principles while leaving signatory corporations free to choose that which they wish to support actively .
