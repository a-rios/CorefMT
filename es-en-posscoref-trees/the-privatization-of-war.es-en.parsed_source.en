The Privatization of War 
That many governments outside the US are skeptical about any US-led invasion of Iraq , when not openly opposed to it , is well known . 
Less recognized is the division between America and much of the world on how to combat terrorism . 
That division is dangerous . 
It is not surprising that attitudes diverged so soon after the initial solidarity that followed the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington in September 2001 . 
After all , the tragedy of September 11 th happened within the US , so the sense of immediacy was greater and longer lasting there . 
In Europe , many governments are anxious not to frighten their populations or damage relations with their Muslim minorities . 
Some believe that American foreign policy was partly responsible for the disaster and that it would be wise to distance themselves somewhat from the US . 
Perhaps the most important factor opening this divide was a widespread sense of déjà vu . 
Europe lived through severe terrorist episodes in the 1970s and 1980s , yet managed to overcome them with their democracies intact . 
Terrorism ( most Europeans think ) is a nuisance to be managed , not a challenge requiring total change . 
Moreover , the political rhetoric of &quot; evil &quot; and &quot; war &quot; that mobilizes Americans seems alien to those who prefer a managerial approach . 
Different perceptions are natural among different political cultures . 
Unchecked , however , these conflicting views could have dangerous effects by limiting the cooperation that is needed to address common vulnerabilities . 
Such cooperation is essential because today &apos;s terrorism is markedly more lethal and difficult to manage than earlier versions . 
Two sets of trends are at work . 
The first centers around economics and technology . 
Market forces and openness combine to increase the efficiency of many vital systems - transportation , information , and energy - but also make them more vulnerable . 
Democratization of technology enables instruments of mass destruction to become smaller , less costly , and more readily available . 
Where bombs and timers were once heavy and expensive , plastic explosives and digital timers are light and cheap . 
Hijacking a plane sometimes costs little more than the price of a ticket . 
The information revolution has also helped terrorists , providing inexpensive means of communication and organization that allow groups once restricted to local and national police jurisdictions to become global . 
Thirty years ago , instantaneous global communication was mostly restricted to large entities ( governments , multinational firms , the Catholic Church ) with big budgets . 
The Internet makes it virtually free . 
The second set of trends reflects changes in the motivation and organization of terrorist groups . 
Mid-20 th century terrorists tended to have relatively well-defined political objectives , which were often ill-served by mass destruction . 
Many were supported and covertly controlled by governments . 
At the century &apos;s end , radical groups grew on the fringes of several religions . 
Most numerous were the tens of thousands of young Muslim men who went to fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan . 
Terrorism became more brutal and indiscriminate as motivations changed from the limited and political to unlimited or retributive objectives reinforced by promises of rewards in the afterlife . 
Organization also changed . 
Al Qaeda &apos;s network of tens of thousands of people in loosely affiliated cells in some sixty countries gives it a scale surpassing anything seen before . 
Both trends make managing terrorism more difficult . 
Today &apos;s focus is properly on terrorism associated with Islamic extremists . 
But limiting attention to Islamic terrorists would be a mistake , because it ignores the wider effects of the democratization of technology and the broader set of challenges that must be met . 
New technologies have put into the hands of deviant groups and individuals destructive powers once limited to governments . 
Every large group of humans contains members who deviate from the norm . 
Some are bent on destruction . 
Recall that a homegrown anti-government fanatic , Timothy McVeigh , perpetrated the worst case of terrorism in the US before September 11th , 2001 . 
Similarly , the Aum Shinrykio cult that spread the poison gas sarin in Tokyo &apos;s subway in 1995 had no connection to Islam . 
Indeed , whatever the source of terrorism , its lethality is increasing . 
In the 1970s , the Palestinian attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics or killings by the Red Brigades cost dozens of lives . 
In the l980s , Sikh extremists bombed an Air India flight , killing 325 people . 
Destroying New York &apos;s Twin Towers cost several thousand lives . 
If one extrapolates from these trends and envisions some deviant group gaining access to biological or nuclear materials , it is possible to imagine terrorists murdering millions . 
To kill so many people , deviants like Hitler or Stalin needed a totalitarian government . 
But now it is easy to envisage deviant groups and / or individuals killing millions without state support . 
This &quot; privatization of war &quot; dramatically changes world politics . 
The next step in the escalation of terrorism will have profound effects on the nature of our urban civilizations . 
What would happen to our willingness to live and work in cities , to real estate prices , to museums and theatres if instead of destroying two office buildings , a future attack destroys the lower half of Manhattan or the Left Bank in Paris ? 
Today &apos;s terrorism is nothing like the 1970s terrorism of the IRA , ETA , or the Red Brigades . 
Not one but many societies are vulnerable . 
One need not accept all the rhetoric or policies of George W. Bush to recognize that he is correct on a central point . 
Business as usual will not be enough .
