G-8 Summit and Climate Change 
Two years ago , the G8 Summit in Gleneagles , Scotland promised to advance a clean development agenda and mobilize financial support for greener growth in the key emerging market economies . 
This year &apos;s meeting , in Heiligendamm , Germany , must deliver on that promise . 
Since Gleneagles , a critical mass of public support to act decisively on climate change has developed . 
Some say a tipping point has occurred . 
The science and the economics of climate change has come closer as a result of the overwhelming scientific evidence in the studies of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and Sir Nicholas Stern &apos;s Report for the UK government on the costs of action and inaction . 
Around the world expert officials , the business community , concerned citizens , and responsive governments are coming together to find common solutions to a global problem that may be the single most important issue we face as a global community . 
In Heiligendamm , the G-8 leaders , together with representatives of major emerging economies ( Brazil , Mexico , China , India , and South Africa , who have a critical stake in energy consumption to continue to generate economic growth ) , will discuss a comprehensive approach encompassing a set of energy options , from energy efficiency and renewable energy , to clean coal , carbon capture and storage , and carbon sequestration . 
They also have a chance to advance the use of market mechanisms to do two things : mitigate climate change , and , at the same time , create incentives for expanded use of clean energy . 
An important way to achieve both objectives is by expanding carbon markets . 
Carbon finance is an effective vehicle for channeling funds for climate-friendly investments , including to the developing world . 
Last year alone the size of the world carbon market tripled to over $ 30 billion , of which about 20 percent went to projects in the developing world . 
By one estimate , with a long term , predictable , and equitable post-2012 global regulatory framework for curbing greenhouse gas emissions ( when the Kyoto protocol expires ) , carbon markets could develop exponentially and deliver financial flows to developing countries of anywhere between $ 20 and $ 120 billion dollars / year . 
The funds are sorely needed . 
The World Bank calculations show that developing countries need an annual investment of about $ 165 billion through 2030 just to supply electricity to their people . 
Of this sum , only about half is readily identifiable . 
On top of this $ 80 billion gap , developing countries will need another $ 30 billion per year to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector alone and get on a low-carbon development path , and $ 10-40 billion dollars more per year to adapt to the already inevitable impact of climate change . 
A G8 commitment to the global carbon market will foster long-term financing beyond 2012 . 
Such carbon finance can also tackle deforestation , which represents about 20 % of the global CO2 emissions causing climate change . 
A forest carbon facility can reward forest conservation as a means of protecting the climate while also preserving ecosystems and generating income for poor communities in developing countries . 
The World Bank is keen to work with partners to experiment with such a facility for avoided deforestation . 
An expanded carbon market can help pay for a transformation to a low carbon economy , but it won &apos;t be enough . 
Like other new markets , it will take time to mature and reach out to places with weaker market institutions . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that rich countries need to take the lead because only then will the less developed economies follow , and she is right . 
The United Kingdom recently announced a new Â£ 800 million Environmental Transformation Fund International Window . 
Japan &apos;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country is ready to look into the possibility of creating a new financial mechanism , with substantial funds for the relatively long- term , to help developing countries halt global warming . These are the types of climate change leadership that the world needs . 
Mobilizing large scale financing for clean investments today and over the next 5-10 years is critical because this is when developing countries will essentially &quot; lock-in &quot; carbon emissions for the next 50 years . 
If we can help them get on a low carbon path , we will have taken a giant step forward in preserving and protecting our planet while enabling them to reduce poverty and offer their citizens a better future . 
The meeting in Heiligendamm can advance the commitments made at Gleneagles two years ago and bring the world closer to a more sustainable future .
