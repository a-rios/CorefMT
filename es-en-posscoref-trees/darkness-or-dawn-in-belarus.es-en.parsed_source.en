Darkness or Dawn in Belarus ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - As pro-democracy protests sweep the Arab world , Belarus , Europe &apos;s grim quasi-Soviet redoubt , has taken a turn for the worse since President Aleksander Lukashenko violently suppressed post-election demonstrations in December and imprisoned seven of the nine candidates who stood against him . 
But , as Western governments - and European Union government , in particular - respond , they should view Lukashenko &apos;s brutal crackdown as a major turning point : the moment when the regime could no longer claim popular support and was forced to confront the failure of its antediluvian socioeconomic model . 
Lukashenko &apos;s regime has rested on three pillars : a social contract that promises national independence and a guaranteed low income in exchange for tacit consent to dictatorial rule ; a propaganda machine that reinforces the value and necessity of this deal ; and a massive security apparatus to enforce it . 
For many years after Lukashenko was first elected , in 1994 ( he has ruled without interruption ever since ) , most Belarusians did perhaps tolerate the regime , because they believed that it protected them from the worst excesses of neighboring Russia &apos;s &quot; Wild East &quot; capitalism : corrupt privatization , job losses , and mafia rule . 
But , over time , and with more Belarusians traveling to the West , belief in Lukashenko &apos;s leadership has become unsustainable . 
Wages are much lower than official figures suggest - perhaps as low as $ 200-300 per month . 
The unemployment rate is 0.7 % , but largely because those who register at labor offices are put to work in community-service jobs paying $ 10-15 per month . 
Prices are high , owing to trade restrictions and government support for inefficient state enterprises . 
Economic growth , pumped up during the run-up to the presidential election by enormous fiscal spending - two-thirds of the economy is state-owned - was officially 7.6 % in 2010 , but the rate has plummeted since , though no one is saying by how much . 
Whatever its past successes in maintaining basic living standards , today it is evident that Belarus cannot match its neighbors &quot; dynamism . 
While many pensioners and some workers remain content with life under Lukashenko , young people , and those with the most education and talent , voted against him in December - and much evidence suggests that he won less than 50 % . 
That , apparently , was too much for the president &apos;s fragile ego . 
Amid mounting repression and growing Western protest , Lukashenko vowed in his inauguration address in January that he would tolerate no threat to &quot; stability . &quot; 
And yet Lukashenko is no fool . 
He might not respect the outcome of elections , but he cannot afford to ignore what the last one revealed about the depths of his regime &apos;s unpopularity . 
His problem is the regime &apos;s utter loss of legitimacy , which means that repression will not be enough . 
He needs to strike a new bargain with Belarusians , and he knows it : economic modernization with political &quot; stability . &quot; 
The first steps will be taken this year . 
The regime currently operates a bloated , inefficient industrial sector to maintain employment , which is possible because the government derives most of its revenue from natural-resources trade ( mainly refined Russian oil and domestic potash deposits ) and transit fees for deliveries of Russian oil and natural gas to Europe . 
Yet now , Lukashenko wishes to harness entrepreneurship and foreign direct investment in a bid to modernize the economy . 
Belarus already has a budding software industry that reports net annual revenues of $ 300 million . 
And , with Austrian money and World Bank support , officials are drawing up a privatization program that will cover a significant proportion of the country &apos;s mainly state-owned industry . 
While the specific companies to be sold have not been announced , the government has indicated that it would sell a 25 % share of the giant potash producer Belaruskali . 
Lukashenko hopes that dramatic economic reforms will win Western support , disarm foreign and domestic critics , and achieve economic modernization under authoritarian rule . 
But he risks angering laid-off workers and empowering inefficient crony capitalists , while moving too slowly to satisfy the desires of those who voted ( and took to the streets to protest ) against him . 
And Belarus is no China : it is not too big to be punished for its government &apos;s behavior . 
Yet Western policy towards Belarus must be carefully modulated , and it should emphasize Europe &apos;s soft power - the attractiveness of its social model to an increasing number of Belarusians . 
The West needs to cultivate relations with these people and invest in the economy , while rejecting the brutality of the regime , which may become easier if privatization moves ahead . 
Visa policy will be a big part of the solution . 
Belarusians currently pay â‚¬ 60 for an EU tourist visa , which is a major obstacle in view of low wages . 
Poland has announced that it will grant Belarusians visas at no cost , while denying visas to a long list of regime officials that it says were involved in the recent electoral fraud . 
The rest of the EU has followed suit on sanctions against top officials , but could do more to liberalize travel for citizens . 
Economic engagement is more controversial . 
Investment in Belarus arguably strengthens the regime , but it also may be necessary for the eventual emergence of a democratic Belarus . 
Person-to-person exchanges should also be encouraged , and the support that countries like Poland give to the Belarusian opposition should be stepped up . 
The bottom line is this : Belarus &apos;s ordinary people and victims of repression need help today . 
The West should use that fact to its fullest advantage .
