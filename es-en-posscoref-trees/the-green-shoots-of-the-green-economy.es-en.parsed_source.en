The Green Shoots of the Green Economy 
NAIROBI - In just two years , the idea of a &quot; Green Economy , &quot; with its links to sustainable development and poverty eradication , has gone from being an interesting idea to being among the top two issues at the upcoming UN Conference on Sustainable Development , or Rio + 20 . 
Many people may wonder whether the Green Economy is just pleasing jargon or a genuinely new pathway to a low-carbon , resource-efficient , and sustainable twenty-first century . 
Is it the fundamental departure from the development models of the past that its advocates proclaim , or just another case of the emperor &apos;s new environmental clothes ? 
Perhaps the answer can be found in some of the extraordinary transitions taking place in the electricity and energy sectors around the world . 
Many people , for example , scoff at the idea that solar power could be anything but a niche market for enthusiasts or a costly white elephant , over-hyped by environmental do-gooders . 
In 2002 , one private equity fund estimated that annual installations of solar photovoltaic ( PV ) arrays might reach 1.5 gigawatts ( GW ) by 2010 . 
In fact , 17.5 GW was installed in 2010 , up 130 % from 2009 . 
All of this is not happening only in developed economies like Germany , Spain , and the United States , but in countries like Bangladesh , Brazil , China , India , Mexico , and Morocco . 
Indeed , according to an estimate by IMS Market Research , more than 30 countries will be part of this emerging solar revolution by 2015 . 
None of this has come about by chance . 
Some countries have moved early to embrace the energy dimension of a Green Economy , and have introduced the necessary public policies and incentives . 
Considerable manufacturing capacity has been added , which has halved costs over the past two years . 
In fact , PV prices are set to halve again this year . 
A nuclear power plant can take 10-15 years to build , and a coal-fired power station around five years . 
Mid-size solar plants of 5-10 negawatts , however , are now taking only about three months to get from the planning stage to construction . 
With the advent of smart grids and free-market pricing , solar PV seems well positioned to provide solutions that are quick to build and scalable . 
The International Energy Agency estimates that , to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030 , around $ 33 billion in additional annual investments in the power sector will be needed . 
That sounds like a lot of money , especially in the wake of the economic and financial crisis that is still troubling large parts of the world . 
Multibillion-dollar investments also flowed into new wind farms , geothermal plants , and a host of other renewable-energy technologies . 
The green shoots of a Green Economy are emerging across the power sector , driven by concerns about climate change , air pollution , and energy security - as well as by the desire to generate new kinds of competitive , employment-growing industries . 
They can also be seen in the growth of recycling industries in South Korea , or the way Indonesia is factoring forests into its social and economic planning . 
The challenge for Rio + 20 is to agree on a range of forward-looking policies that can be deployed in part or in whole to accelerate all of this up . 
At the UN Environment Program &apos;s upcoming Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum in Nairobi , Kenya , we will launch a landmark contribution to this debate , with the release of A Transition to a Green Economy . 
The report analyzes how a global investment of 2 % of global GDP in the Green Economy could unleash economic growth and positive social outcomes , while keeping humanity &apos;s planetary footprint within sustainable boundaries . 
In particular , the catalytic choices for ten sectors - from agriculture , fisheries , and forests to transport and buildings - are as relevant to developing as they are to developed countries . 
There will always be those who smile skeptically at the mere notion of a Green Economy and dismiss such far-reaching transitions . 
It is time to put the numbers on the table and show how advances in solar power alone are starting to prove them wrong .
