The Hamas Earthquake 
Hamas &apos;s crushing defeat of Fatah in this week &apos;s elections brings the Palestinian people to a crossroads . 
An Islamist political party that previously abstained from national politics and rejects Fatah &apos;s policy of negotiations with Israel , is now in charge in Palestine . 
Hamas won 76 of 132 seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council , and can count on support from four independent deputies . 
Overall , that &apos;s 60 % of the seats in Parliament , won in nearly every district in the West Bank and Gaza . 
Hamas entered electoral politics only recently , but its massive victory was preceded by wide success in municipal elections . 
Hamas &apos;s political moment has come . 
Under Palestinian law , Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , must now ask Hamas to form a new government . 
For their part , Fatah officials seem unwilling to join a Hamas-led government . 
Although Hamas has said that it would seek such a coalition , Fatah &apos;s humiliating defeat has left it with little credibility as a governing partner . 
So far , Fatah &apos;s senior leaders have declared that they will be a loyal opposition in Parliament , leaving governmental responsibility to Hamas . 
Instead , they will have to focus on rebuilding and reenergizing Fatah . 
Hamas is well aware of the shock that its victory has produced . 
If Fatah refuses to join a coalition , Hamas may opt for a government of independents and technocrats . 
It is unlikely that Hamas will form a government composed of hardliners . 
The political , security , and economic circumstances of the Palestinians require a government focused on solving problems , not ideological purity . 
The most urgent challenge facing the new government is rampant lawlessness and anarchy throughout Palestinian society . 
Murder , kidnapping , and extortion have reached record heights . 
Armed individuals resort to kidnapping to get jobs , free family members from prison , and exact revenge . 
Often , the people involved in these crimes belong to local gangs or even to the militias of large clans . 
In opposition , Hamas adamantly refused to collect illegal weapons . 
Now , it will have to deal with a Palestinian society that is armed to the teeth , with poverty rates reaching 70 % and unemployment at 35 % . 
Having benefited from overwhelming political rejection of Fatah , Hamas will now be judged by how it uses its new authority . 
For the first time , a political clock is ticking for Hamas . 
Senior Hamas officials are well aware of the challenge , and have promised a complete overhaul of Palestinian public services and administration . 
More than anything else , Hamas &apos;s success in the coming months will be measured by its response to these issues . 
Will Hamas be able to root out corruption and incompetence , and deliver services fairly and efficiently ? 
How will its election affect Palestine &apos;s foreign aid inflows , which form major component of the national budget ? 
Initial international reaction to the Hamas victory has been severe . 
The Bush administration has declared that it will not deal with a Hamas government , because Hamas remains committed to Israel &apos;s destruction . 
This , indeed , is the language of Hamas &apos;s 1988 covenant . 
Interestingly , however , Hamas &apos;s election platform combined different approaches to the issue of a Palestinian state . 
On the one hand , Hamas agreed for the first time to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza , with East Jerusalem as its capital . 
On the other hand , the platform repeats Hamas &apos;s refusal to relinquish even an inch of historic Palestine . Whether Hamas can actually be transformed into a more moderate organization is impossible to say right now . 
But it is clear that Hamas is now vulnerable to public opinion and , as a governing authority , will have to deal with the international response to its victory . 
Immediately after the election , a senior Hamas official , Mahmoud al-Zahar , said that Hamas would maintain the cease-fire with Israel begun last February , if Israel did the same . 
Hamas may be signaling that it will not provoke Israel . 
Perhaps its governing responsibilities will push Hamas toward ongoing discussions with the United States and the international community . 
In any case , despite the election results , and even without Fatah in government , Abbas remains in charge of negotiations with Israel . 
He has quickly called for a revival of peace talks , although Israel , like the US , has refused to deal with Hamas . 
They turned out in droves to vote in an election that former US President Jimmy Carter described as honest , fair and unmarked by violence . 
They elected a party which called for &quot; reform and change &quot; in response to a decade of violence and lawlessness . 
And Palestinians accepted Hamas &apos;s view that negotiations based on the Oslo Accords could not achieve Palestinian rights and political ambitions . 
Victory achieved , Hamas will take on the responsibility for the Palestinian side in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
With the Palestinians &quot; future at stake - not to mention the future of Israel and the Middle East - no one can say if Hamas is up to the task .
