Making the IMF and World Bank Work for the Poor 
The World Bank has long proclaimed its dream of &quot; a world free from poverty . &quot; 
Likewise , the International Monetary Fund may arguably desire &quot; a world free from financial crisis . &quot; 
These are crucial and daunting objectives , but they are too narrow for the twenty-first century . 
To remain relevant , the Bretton Woods institutions must fully adapt to the needs of the world &apos;s rapidly emerging countries , and they can begin that process at this spring &apos;s IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington . 
As many now acknowledge , the IMF should look beyond managing financial crises and start addressing non-cooperative economic behaviors - notably in the monetary field . 
The international community would gain from the IMF &apos;s becoming a center of joint-monitoring and permanent dialogue among the world &apos;s rich , poor and emerging nations . 
But for that to happen , the latter two need a greater say . 
Fortunately , such reform is at last on the agenda . 
Last autumn &apos;s IMF-World Bank meetings approved an increase in voting quotas for some of the most under-represented emerging economies : China , Mexico , South Korea , and Turkey . 
A second round of adjustment will need to involve other fast-paced economies without crushing the voice of the poorest . 
As for the World Bank , it does not need to &quot; reposition &quot; itself so much as to root itself in emerging countries , as does the development aid industry in general . 
The international community must resist shortsighted calls to withdraw from middle-income nations on the ground that they could now &quot; go it alone . &quot; 
When it comes to global governance , communicable diseases , climate change , or threats to biodiversity , these countries &quot; importance speaks for itself . 
They account for 44 % of people living with HIV / AIDS , 47 % of global CO2 emissions , and 52 % of the planet &apos;s protected natural areas . 
The international community simply cannot leave them to their own devices on such crucial issues without jeopardizing its own future . 
Fighting poverty is a non-negotiable objective . 
But it cannot be the sole purpose of international aid , nor of the World Bank . 
In fact , a genuine commitment to poverty reduction implies working with these countries . 
They are home to 70 % of the population that lives on less than $ 2 a day , facing massive unemployment , gross inequalities , lack of infrastructure , regional imbalances , and a litany of other challenges . 
Some critics argue that lending public money to middle-income countries is no longer necessary , due to their access to financial markets . 
True , private capital flows have surged in the wake of global liberalization and these countries &quot; privatization schemes . 
But private capital flows have proven to be volatile and prone to sudden interruptions , as exemplified by the Asian and Russian financial crises of the late 1990 &quot; s , or more recently by investors pulling out from infrastructure sectors . 
Another line of suspicion against public lending is that it crowds out private investment . 
However , an increasing body of evidence documents the positive impact of public investment on productivity and economic growth . 
It suggests complementarity rather than substitutability between private and public funds . 
Detractors ultimately fall back on the argument that multilateral lending to middle-income countries is waning along with demand . 
But , while loan volumes have decreased by a third since the last financial crisis , this is only a return to normalcy . 
After an all-time high due to emergency aid to countries like South Korea or Argentina , lending is back to its trend line of around $ 25 billion a year . 
While lending by the World Bank did fall below its mid-1990 &quot; s level , it is growing again , reflecting the expansion of regional multilateral banks and a policy pendulum that is swinging back to publicly-financed infrastructure projects . 
This does not mean that business as usual should be good enough for the World Bank . 
Its products need to be adapted . 
With decentralization taking place in many emerging economies , sub-national authorities are taking on more responsibilities . 
The Bank should be able to work with them in the absence of sovereign guarantees , and increase its loan offerings in local currencies , since these partners cannot afford currency risk . 
To further &quot; crowd in &quot; the private sector , insurance and guarantees can help . 
Beyond this , more financial engineering is needed to draw upon the creativity of financial markets . 
Finally , as David de Ferranti , a former World Bank vice-president , has pointed out , the Bank should expand its intellectual partnerships and engage with the highly trained professionals , consulting firms , and research institutions that emerging countries now boast . 
The Bank must be open to local invention if it is to be accepted by and relevant to middle-income nations . 
In terms of purchasing power parity , per capita income in middle-income countries is still about 15 % of that of developed nations . 
The time has not yet come to shake hands and part company . 
Convergence is on the way , but minimizing its global costs requires redesigning the Bretton Woods institutions to meet the challenges faced by emerging countries .
