The Price of European Indifference 
BAGHDAD - Europe &apos;s migration debate has taken a disturbing turn . 
It began with the creation of the catch-all concept ( a legal freak ) of a &quot; migrant , &quot; which obscures the difference , central to the law , between economic and political migration , between people escaping poverty and those driven from their homes by war . 
Unlike economic migrants , those fleeing oppression , terror , and massacre have an inalienable right to asylum , which entails an unconditional obligation by the international community to provide shelter . 
Even when the distinction is acknowledged , it is often as part of another sleight of hand , an attempt to convince credulous minds that the men , women , and children who paid thousands of dollars to travel on one of the rickety boats washing up on the islands of Lampedusa or Kos are economic migrants . 
The reality , however , is that 80 % of these people are refugees , attempting to escape despotism , terror , and religious extremism in countries like Syria , Eritrea , and Afghanistan . 
That is why international law requires that the cases of asylum-seekers are examined not in bulk , but one by one . 
And even when that is accepted , when the sheer number of people clamoring to get to Europe &apos;s shores makes it all but impossible to deny the barbarity driving them to flee , a third smokescreen goes up . 
Some , including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , claim that the conflicts generating these refugees rage only in Arab countries that are being bombed by the West . 
Here again , the figures do not lie . 
The top source of refugees is Syria , where the international community has refused to conduct the kinds of military operations required by the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; - even though international law demands intervention when a mad despot , having killed 240,000 of his people , undertakes to empty his country . 
The West also is not bombing Eritrea , another major source of refugees . 
Yet another damaging myth , perpetuated by shocking images of refugees swarming through border fences or attempting to climb onto trains in Calais , is that &quot; Fortress Europe &quot; is under assault by waves of barbarians . 
This is wrong on two levels . 
First , Europe is far from being the migrants &quot; primary destination . 
Nearly two million refugees from Syria alone have headed to Turkey , and one million have fled to Lebanon , whose population amounts to just 3.5 million . 
Jordan , with a population of 6.5 million , has taken in nearly 700,000 . 
Meanwhile , Europe , in a display of united selfishness , has scuttled a plan to relocate a mere 40,000 asylum-seekers from their cities of refuge in Italy and Greece . 
Second , the minority who do choose Germany , France , Scandinavia , the United Kingdom , or Hungary are not enemies who have come to destroy us or even to sponge off of European taxpayers . 
They are applicants for freedom , lovers of our promised land , our social model , and our values . 
Europe ! &quot; the way millions of Europeans , arriving a century ago on Ellis Island , learned to sing &quot; America the Beautiful . &quot; 
Then there is the ugly rumor that this imaginary assault has been clandestinely orchestrated by the strategists of a &quot; great replacement , &quot; with foreigners supplanting native Europeans , or , worse , by agents of an international jihad , in which today &apos;s migrants are tomorrow &apos;s terrorists on bullet trains . 
It should go without saying that this is nonsense . 
Taken together , these distortions and delusions have had serious consequences . 
For starters , the Mediterranean Sea has been all but abandoned to human smugglers . 
The Mare Nostrum is gradually becoming the kind of vast and watery mass grave described by a faraway poet . 
Some 2,350 people have drowned already this year . 
But , for most Europeans , these people are little more than statistics , just as the women and men who have survived the journey remain unidentified and indistinguishable , a threatening anonymous mass . 
Our society of the spectacle , normally so quick to manufacture an instant celebrity to serve as the &quot; face &quot; of the crisis du jour ( anything from swine flu to a truckers &quot; strike ) , has not taken an interest in the fate of a single one of the &quot; migrants . &quot; 
These individuals - whose course to Europe resembles that of the Phoenician Princess Europa , who arrived from Tyre on Zeus &apos;s back several millennia ago - are being wholly rejected ; indeed , walls are being constructed to keep them out . 
The result is another group of people being denied basic rights . 
Such people , as Hannah Arendt once observed , will ultimately come to see in the commission of a crime their only path into the world of law and of those who enjoy the rights the law confers . 
Europe , harassed by its xenophobes and consumed by self-doubt , has turned its back on its values . 
Indeed , it has forgotten what it is . 
The bell tolls not only for the migrants , but also for a Europe whose humanistic patrimony is crumbling before our very eyes .
