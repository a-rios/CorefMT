A Surplus of Controversy 
CAMBRIDGE - When the US Treasury recently added its voice to the chorus of critics of Germany &apos;s chronic current-account surplus , it underscored the deep disagreement over what , if anything , should be done about it . 
The critics want Germany to increase its contribution to global demand by importing more and exporting less . 
The Germans view the maintenance of strong balance sheets as essential to their country &apos;s stabilizing role in Europe . 
Both sides &quot; arguments will certainly receive a full airing at the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank . 
Unfortunately , the debate has too often been informed more by ideology than facts . 
The difference between what a country exports and imports can reflect myriad factors , including business cycles , demographics , investment opportunities , and economic diversification . 
It can also reflect the government &apos;s penchant for running fiscal surpluses ; after all , the current-account surplus , by definition , is the excess of public and private savings over investment . 
During the first half of the 2000 &quot; s , US policymakers chose not to worry about sustained current-account deficits , which peaked at above 6 % of GDP . 
They argued at first that the deficits merely reflected the world &apos;s attraction to superior US investment opportunities , an odd position given that the US was not growing especially quickly compared to emerging markets . 
Later , academic researchers identified more plausible reasons why the US might be able to run large deficits without great risk , as long as investors &quot; desire for diversification , safety , and liquidity sustained global demand for US assets . 
But policymakers should have recognized that even these better rationales had limits , and that massive sustained current-account deficits are often a blinking red signal of deeper problems - in this case , over-borrowing by households to finance home purchases . 
In the case of Germany , of course , we are talking about surpluses , not deficits . 
And even though the surpluses exceed 6 % of German national income and would seem to be on the same order of magnitude as pre-crisis US deficits , one must remember that the German economy is less than a quarter the size of the US ( at market exchange rates ) . 
However , as the Center for European Policy Studies &quot; Daniel Gros has pointed out , the issue is not simply Germany . 
Smaller northern European countries , including the Netherlands , Switzerland , Sweden , and Norway have been collectively running surpluses at least as large as Germany &apos;s relative to national income , and , in absolute terms , their combined surpluses are even larger . 
So the issue obviously merits attention . 
But what is the cause , and is it related to policy ? 
Certainly , no one can criticize northern Europe for exchange-rate undervaluation . 
By almost any purchasing-power measure , the euro seems overvalued ( and the Swiss franc even more so ) . 
Keynesians look at these surpluses and say that the northern European countries should drive them down by running much larger fiscal deficits to boost domestic demand . 
They have a point , but they grossly overstate the case . 
Many studies have shown that changes in private savings and investment tend to offset partly the current-account effects of higher fiscal deficits . 
For example , larger German fiscal deficits would hardly have been a decisive factor in Europe . 
Research by the IMF and others suggests that the demand spillovers from German fiscal policy to Europe are likely to be modest , particularly in the eurozone &apos;s troubled countries , like Greece and Portugal . 
Germany trades with the entire world . 
The European Commission has recently completed its own report on Germany &apos;s surpluses , concluding that it is difficult to pin down the many factors underlying it , which of course is true . 
For example , Germany &apos;s capital-goods exporters have benefited enormously from growth in China . 
The Commission nonetheless argues persuasively that policies to promote public and private investment would tame the surpluses in the short term and strengthen German growth in the long term . 
One might add that there are still extensive impediments to competition in the service and retail sectors in many northern European countries . 
Removing them would increase consumption of all goods , including imports . 
And Germany is right to point out that its strong balance sheet underpins Europe &apos;s fragile stability today . 
Would European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s vow in the summer of 2012 to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to save the euro have been nearly as effective if investors doubted Germany &apos;s underlying financial strength and resolve ? 
At the same time , it is also true that Germany could have been more forthcoming and more liberal in using its balance sheet to defuse debt-overhang problems in periphery countries like Portugal and Greece , and perhaps even Ireland and Spain . 
The bottom line is that large sustained external imbalances are something that global policymakers do need to monitor closely , because , as the US housing bust showed , they can be an indicator of problems that need to be investigated more deeply . 
And critics of the surplus countries are right that there are two sides to every balance , and that policies in both surplus and deficit countries should be subject to review . 
But it is wrong to believe that simplistic answers , such as more fiscal stimulus or more austerity , are a panacea ; more often , the underlying problems relate to debt , structural rigidities , low investment , and weak competitiveness .
