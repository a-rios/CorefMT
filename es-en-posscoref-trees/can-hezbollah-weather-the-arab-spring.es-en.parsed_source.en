Can Hezbollah Weather the Arab Spring ? 
BEIRUT -Three years ago , regional opinion polls showed that the Middle East &apos;s most popular leaders were Hezbollah leader Sayed Hassan Nasrallah , Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , and Iran &apos;s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 
People at the time appreciated that they were standing up to Israel in Lebanon and Gaza , and pushing back against aggressive American policies in the region . 
With the Arab Spring , regional public opinion has shifted toward prioritizing civil rights and democratic reform over foreign policy . 
Today , Assad is reviled , Ahmadinejad &apos;s government is accused of violently suppressing its own pro-democracy protestors , and both Hezbollah and Iran are condemned for continuing to back Assad as he slaughters his own population . 
As a result , Hezbollah is no longer the widely popular movement that it once was across the Arab and Muslim worlds , but it remains a highly effective and heavily armed force . 
To be sure , Hezbollah is still grudgingly respected for its ability to stand up to Israel . 
But Hezbollah &apos;s hard power has , up to now , not been affected by developments in the Arab Spring or Syria . 
Its deployment in Lebanon , its fighting capacity , and its thousands of missiles are all still intact . 
Hezbollah was initially thrilled at the outbreak of popular revolts against rulers closely allied with the US and the West . 
Even Libya &apos;s Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi was considered a foe for having allegedly ordered the killing of Lebanese Shiite leader Imam Musa Sadr in 1978 . 
Hezbollah had been in a virtual cold war with Hosni Mubarak &apos;s Egypt since January 2009 , when Nasrallah had effectively accused Mubarak &apos;s government of collusion in Israel &apos;s intervention in Gaza , and had called for the &quot; Egyptian people to take to the streets in their millions . &quot; 
But , as the revolts proceeded , it emerged that people wanted good government and social justice , and were not enamored of Iran or interested in joining an axis of resistance . 
Furthermore , as the Muslim Brotherhood rose in Egypt , Hezbollah &apos;s erstwhile ally , Hamas , drifted away from it and its Syrian and Iranian backers , and found a new footing in Egypt and the Gulf . 
But Hezbollah &apos;s disappointment turned to intense concern when Syrians rebelled against Assad . 
If his regime falls , Hezbollah is at risk of losing its arms-supply bridge to Iran . 
It would be unable to compensate for that loss by relying on Lebanese seaports or Beirut &apos;s airport , because both could easily be blockaded . 
It would still have its full first-strike and retaliatory capacity , but , like a bee , it would be able to sting only once . 
Without the ability to resupply itself , Hezbollah would emerge from any future war a significantly weakened force . 
Within Lebanon itself , Hezbollah is still strong , but its comfort level has declined . 
In May 2008 , it demonstrated its domestic dominance by taking over the capital , Beirut . 
In January 2011 , it brought down Saad Hariri &apos;s government and installed one more to its liking . 
In a sense , these Sunni groups are creating an armed enclave in northern Lebanon to counterbalance the armed Shia enclaves in Beirut , the south , and the Bekaa region . 
Hezbollah has also been shaken by the abduction and continued detention of a dozen Lebanese Shiites - some close to Nasrallah - by opposition forces in Syria . 
Hezbollah faces parliamentary elections in the spring of 2013 . 
If its Christian ally , Michel Aoun &apos;s Free Patriotic Movement , does poorly , or if the ever-shifting Druze leader Walid Jumblatt returns his Progressive Socialist Party to the anti-Syrian alliance of which it was once a part , Hezbollah would lose its parliamentary majority , and hence its ability to form and topple governments . 
Perhaps anticipating these domestic vulnerabilities , Hezbollah encouraged and joined the resumption of National Dialogue discussions involving all of Lebanon &apos;s main communities . 
Strategically , Hezbollah fears that if Assad falls , and if it loses the ability to resupply itself rapidly and effectively as a result , Israel will take advantage by unleashing another war against it . 
With tensions between Israel and Iran , Hezbollah &apos;s patron , unresolved , this fear cannot be discounted . 
Even if Hezbollah can adjust to the Arab Spring , it fears the winter with Israel that might follow .
