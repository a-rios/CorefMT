Breaking Europe &apos;s Climate-Change Stalemate 
LONDON - Europe has a strong tradition as a leader in the fight against climate change . 
Lately , however , the continent has reached an ideological impasse over how to address the problem , with environmental sustainability and growth often portrayed as being mutually exclusive . 
If Europe is to remain an environmental leader , as well as a center of innovation and competitiveness , it will have to abandon its ideological rigidness and embrace realistic , pragmatic solutions that can deliver environmental benefits without sacrificing economic development . 
The challenges posed by climate change are real , and the consequences of inaction are impossible to ignore . 
At the same time , there is a growing demand for energy and a desperate need for a long-term exit from the ongoing economic crisis . 
There is no single , easy solution that addresses both of these imperatives . 
Reining in global warming while ensuring economic growth will require a balanced portfolio of solutions , including renewable energy and increased energy efficiency . 
Essential among such solutions is carbon capture and storage . 
CCS technology captures carbon dioxide at the source of its emission , compresses it , and stores it permanently underground . 
In doing so , it provides an important bridge between our modern economy , which relies heavily on carbon-intensive fossil fuels , and a future in which CO 2 emissions are greatly reduced . 
This provides the means for maintaining a competitive industrial sector while simultaneously combating global warming . 
To be sure , as with any innovation , there are questions about the technology &apos;s viability . 
Some question the scale of the investment needed to install and maintain the systems necessary for capturing and storing CO 2 . 
It is important to note , however , that these costs pale in comparison with the far greater costs of reducing CO2 emissions without CCS . 
According to the International Energy Agency , for example , a ten-year delay in deploying CCS would increase the cost of decarburizing the power sector by â‚¬ 750 billion ( $ 880 billion ) . 
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been unequivocal in its insistence that reducing CO 2 emissions and diminishing dependence on fossil fuels is more urgent than ever . 
It has made it clear that CCS , the only technology that can capture at least 90 % of the CO2 emissions from the world &apos;s largest producers , must be a part of the solution . 
Beyond Europe &apos;s borders , governments and businesses are already forging ahead . 
In Canada , the world &apos;s first full-scale CCS project , Boundary Dam , came onstream in October 2014 , proving that the technology is viable and ready to be deployed . 
The United Arab Emirates has initiated the world &apos;s first large-scale CCS project in the iron and steel sector . 
China continues to show great interest in the technology , and is collaborating with the United States to develop its CCS capabilities . 
Europe cannot afford to lag behind . 
Energy-intensive industries directly support four million jobs across the continent . 
Investing in CCS would help preserve Europe &apos;s economic base by securing and creating jobs and protecting vital industries . 
It would help to realize a vision of Europe that supports both sustainability and growth - a vision that is clearly in line with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker &apos;s priorities of creating jobs , sustaining growth , and developing a competitive energy union . 
The continent &apos;s largest petroleum companies , and equipment suppliers , are ready to invest what is needed to reduce CO 2 emissions . 
But , in order for that to be possible , realistic policies and strategies are needed . 
CCS has been recognized at the highest political level as a part of the European Union &apos;s 2030 Climate and Energy framework and the European Energy Security Strategy . 
But it is time to translate recognition into concrete action . 
That , in turn , requires investment incentives , improved carbon pricing , and an upgrade to the emissions trading system . 
A game-changing solution presupposes substantial political will ; it is essential that European leaders show that they know what needs to be done . 
Sustainable growth need not be an oxymoron . 
But to achieve it , Europe must overcome the ideological stalemate that is paralyzing the environmental debate . 
To reconcile our environmental priorities with continued growth , we must act realistically , pragmatically , and - above all - immediately .
