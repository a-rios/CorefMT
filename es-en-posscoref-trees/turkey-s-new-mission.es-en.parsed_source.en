Turkey &apos;s New Mission 
TEL AVIV - Ever since Turkey &apos;s establishment as a republic , the country has oscillated between the Western-oriented heritage of its founder , Kemal Ataturk , and its eastern , Ottoman legacy . 
Never resolved , modern Turkey &apos;s deep identity complex is now shaking its strategic alliances and recasting its regional and global role . 
Indeed , Turkey &apos;s changing perception of itself has shaped its so-far frustrated drive to serve as a peace broker between Israel and its Arab enemies , Syria and Hamas . 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan &apos;s missionary zeal to replace Egypt as the essential regional mediator , and his violent tirades against Israel &apos;s behavior in Gaza , looks to many people like an attempt to recover Turkey &apos;s Ottoman-era role as the guarantor of regional peace and security . 
Its credentials for this role in the Middle East are by no means negligible . 
Turkey is a true regional superpower , with one of the largest armies in the world . 
At the same time , it is the only Muslim country that , while no less worried than Israel about Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions , can maintain excellent economic and political relations with Iran , regardless of American displeasure . 
Of course , Syria is Iran &apos;s ally , too , but no country in the region has the leverage with it that Turkey possesses . 
And Turkey &apos;s diplomatic reach in the region is also reflected in its recent signing of a friendship treaty with Saudi Arabia , while maintaining excellent relations with Pakistan and Iraq . 
Europe &apos;s persistence in snubbing Turkey &apos;s attempts to join the European Union , the rise of violent anti-Western popular sentiment in the wake of the Iraq war , and strained relations with the US - owing in part to the forthcoming Armenian Genocide Act - are major factors in Turkey &apos;s change of direction . 
The civilizing efforts that Ataturk &apos;s revolution directed inward and in favor of disengagement from the Arab and Muslim worlds are now being revisited . 
The Turkey of Erdogan &apos;s dominant Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) appears to be seeking a new mission civilisatrice , with the Middle East and the former Soviet republics as its alternative horizons . 
The uneasy challenge for Turkey is to secure its newfound regional role without betraying Ataturk &apos;s democratic legacy . 
Turkish democracy and secular values have been greatly enhanced by the country &apos;s dialogue with Europe and its American ties . 
Turkey can be a model for Middle Eastern countries if , while promoting its regional strategic and economic interests , it resists the authoritarian temptation and continues to show that Islam and democracy are fully compatible . 
For Israel , the long overdue message is that its future in the Middle East does not lie in strategic alliances with the region &apos;s non-Arab powers , but in reconciling itself with the Arab world . 
In the 1960 &quot; s , David Ben-Gurion &apos;s fatalistic pessimism about the possibility of ever reaching a peace settlement with the Arab countries led him to forge an &quot; Alliance of the Periphery &quot; with the non-Arab countries in the outer circle of the Middle East - Iran , Ethiopia , and Turkey ( he also dreamed of having Lebanon &apos;s Maronite community as part of that alliance ) . 
All of these countries did not have any particular dispute with Israel , and all , to varying degrees , had tense relations with their Arab neighbors . 
The myth of Israel &apos;s military power , resourcefulness in economic and agricultural matters , and an exaggerated perception of its unique capacity to lobby and influence American policy combined to make the Israeli connection especially attractive to these countries . 
The &quot; Alliance of the Periphery &quot; was a creative attempt to escape the consequences of the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
It reflected the yearning of the Jewish state to unleash its creative energies in economic and social matters , as it created space for an independent , imaginative foreign policy that was not linked to , or conditioned by , the paralyzing constraints of the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
But the security that this scheme was supposed to produce could never really be achieved ; the centrality of the Arab-Israeli conflict could not be attenuated . 
The Arabs &quot; capacity to maintain their pressure on Israel and to keep world opinion focused on the Palestinians &quot; plight made Israel &apos;s quest for evading the consequences of the conflict , either through periodic wars or by forging alternative regional alliances , a futile exercise . 
The Islamic revolution in Iran , the changes in Ethiopia following the end of Haile Selassie &apos;s rule , the collapse of Maronite Lebanon , and Hezbollah &apos;s takeover of that country left Turkey as the last remaining member of Israel &apos;s Alliance of the Periphery . 
Turkey &apos;s powerful military establishment may want to maintain close relations with Israel , but the widely popular change in Turkey &apos;s foreign policy priorities , and the serious identity dilemmas facing the nation , send an unequivocal message that the alliance can no longer serve as an alternative to peace with the Arab world . 
From now on , it can only be complementary to such a peace .
