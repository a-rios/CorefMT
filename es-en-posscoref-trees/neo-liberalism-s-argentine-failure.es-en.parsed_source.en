Neo-liberalism \ u0027s Argentine Failure 
In the 1990s Argentina implemented perhaps 80 % of the neoliberal economic policy agenda . 
It opened up its economy to world trade and international capital ; it sought to guarantee low inflation and sound money . 
It strove to improve its legal system so that decisions would accord with general rules and foster confidence that contracts would be enforced - whether or not a bribe had been paid . 
It failed . 
This is not to say that the 1990s , even with their aftermath leading into the terrible summer of 2002 , were catastrophic . 
Life was clearly worse during the Dirty War of the 1970s , when an army with no honor threw women out of helicopters into the South Atlantic , and urban guerrillas shot people because ... because ... well , just because ! 
The 1980s were hardly better . 
Starting with a full-fledged debt crisis triggered by a massive rise in both US interest rates and the value of the American dollar , the decade ended with domestically-generated hyperinflation , causing Argentina to fall a decade further behind the world &apos;s leading economies . 
In the 1990s , by contrast , Argentina &apos;s GDP per capita grow by 25 % from trough to peak - only to lose this entire income gain over the past four years . 
Until late last winter , Argentina &apos;s problems seemed merely an unpleasant but temporary bump , in the same way that the 1994-1995 Mexican &quot; tequila &quot; crisis or the East Asian crises of 1997-1998 proved to be only temporary interruptions , not watersheds . 
Such optimism is impossible today , and there is little hope that the country &apos;s recent meltdown is only temporary . 
The establishment view - say , in US Treasury Undersecretary John Taylor &apos;s office - is that Argentina &apos;s collapse is the fault of its politicians . 
I half-agree with this view . 
Argentine leaders were repeatedly warned that keeping the exchange rate constant and fixing the peso &apos;s value against the US dollar risked sending the economy into recession if the dollar gained value . 
Argentine politicians were also warned that their peso policy could not be sustained unless the ratio of national debt to GDP was falling . 
Yet during the boom years of 1993-1998 , public spending outran taxes enough to push Argentina &apos;s debt-to-GDP ratio from 29 to 44 % . 
When the dollar appreciated and recession came , politicians with too little statesmanship to balance the budget in good times turned out to have too little courage to balance the budget when times turned hard . 
The coup de gr√¢ce was delivered by the government &apos;s decision ( when the crisis came ) to keep bank deposits fixed in dollars and to change debts owed to banks into pesos , thereby bankrupting the country &apos;s financial system with a single stroke of the pen . 
The establishment position is that if any of these three disastrous policies had not been implemented , Argentina would not have fallen into crisis , or at worst it would have suffered a small tequila-style crisis . 
Argentina &apos;s 1990 &apos;s neo-liberal program was nearly idiot-proof , according to this view , but Argentine politicians turned out to form a large and ingenious class of idiots . 
There is , however , another way of looking at the Argentine tragedy . 
It is based on the observation that the country &apos;s political system has long performed in a predictable way , consistently producing governments that promise more than they can deliver . 
They promise rich oligarchs that they will not collect much in taxes . 
They promise workers and consumers generous social insurance . 
They promise rapid economic development , generous infrastructure spending , cushy low-work jobs for the politically connected , and so forth . 
Taken together , these promises mean that claims on national product always exceed 100 % of the total . 
Popular demands that the government fulfills all of them cannot possibly be met . 
Add to this an unfair distribution of income and wealth , lack of social comity between the working and middle classes , and a long tradition of political violence , and you have the recipe for a politics of all-against-all . 
The basic political fight about how wealth should be distributed in Argentina remains unresolved . 
Any political force that tries to curb the bidding by promising only what it can deliver is doomed to defeat . 
So in Argentina big government deficits are a law of nature , a fact of life . 
Hence Argentine interest rates can be low and affordable only for rare , short periods . 
Everyone knew that Argentina &apos;s political system generates chronic deficits , and this meant that interest payments on the debt were likely to explode . 
Because the dynamics of Argentine debt were so unstable , a hard-currency exchange-rate peg could not last . 
Free access to international capital markets and dollar-denominated bank accounts meant that when the exchange-rate peg finally collided with the deficit-producing logic of Argentine politics , the result could be nothing short of catastrophic . 
Had today &apos;s crisis been finessed , had Argentina another decade of rapid growth , its conflicts over wealth distribution might have moderated . 
After all , Europe before WWII possessed the nastiest politics on earth : rioting right-wing mobs in France , general strikes in Britain , civil war in Spain , fascism in Italy , and the Nazis &apos; vicious consolidation of power in Germany . 
Yet postwar Western Europe encountered no public problems that could not be resolved in ways that preserved sound money and growth . 
I half-agree with this view , too . 
Yes , Argentina &apos;s government made huge mistakes ; its politicians sinned against the gods of monetary economics . 
But did the punishment need to be so swift and so severe ?
