Li &apos;s Balancing Act 
SHANGHAI - Three years of persistent economic slowdown have rattled Chinese economists and policymakers . 
Financial analysts are in a tizzy over whether GDP growth will fall below 7 % , parsing official statements for clues as to whether and when the government will act . 
Beneath this cool exterior , however , China &apos;s leaders are very worried indeed . 
As Liu Shijin , Vice Minister of the Development Research Center of the State Council , recently explained , the dilemma facing the authorities is that another massive stimulus plan to boost growth would mean more outstanding credit - a problematic approach , given the enormous debt and financial risks that local governments have accumulated . 
But an excessively sluggish economy poses its own risks . 
To be sure , China &apos;s government was in a similar situation ten years ago . 
But the economy today is not performing as it was a decade ago . 
China needs new solutions . 
To varying degrees , China &apos;s economy has long swung from short-term growth spurts , fueled by the over-issuance of currency and conventional credit expansion , to contraction , triggered by government action to prevent overheating . 
This &quot; prosperity cycle &quot; - sustained by the abundance of new investment opportunities that were available to neutralize mounting debt and financial risks - has long enabled China to avoid a hard landing . 
A decade ago , when China was fighting deflation , the World Trade Organization came to its rescue , opening up massive new export markets . 
More important , the huge dividend of the just-launched domestic housing reform had yet to pay off . 
The resulting surge of new investment opportunities diminished the risks posed by idle capital and risky debt , while driving increases in investment efficiency and labor productivity . 
But the latest round of deflation-fighting policies , together with the massive stimulus package that the government launched in the wake of the global economic crisis , has led to oversupply in the housing market and idle capital in the manufacturing sector . 
Making matters worse , demand for Chinese exports in Europe and the United States has weakened considerably , and is not expected to rebound . 
All of this has diminished short-term investment opportunities in China , raising fears of a hard landing . 
Of course , China still boasts tremendous investment potential in the long term , especially given the relatively low urbanization rate and the need for structural reform and industrial upgrading . 
In the interim , however , Premier Li Keqiang &apos;s government must achieve a prudent balance between economic growth and financial risk . 
To that end , the government has adjusted its policy target from &quot; economic recovery &quot; to &quot; growth stabilization , &quot; expressing its willingness to accept declining GDP growth up to a certain point - probably 7 % , or even lower - in order to keep financial risk under control . 
But the balance itself is not the goal . 
In Li &apos;s view , what the government really needs to do is buy time for structural adjustment and reform , which are critical to generating the next wave of investment opportunities . 
Li has even adopted a structural approach to stimulating economic growth . 
For example , the mini-stimulus package that was unveiled last month diverts investment to railroads , agriculture , the smart grid , and other productive services . 
But maintaining this balance will not be easy . 
The first challenge will be to ensure that the real-estate market progresses into the adjustment and clearance phases . 
The good news is that many local governments have recently loosened their grip on local real-estate markets , most likely following a central-government directive . 
This could be the start of a virtuous circle , with price adjustments helping to clear up stock . 
The movement of the housing market into a clearance phase , without causing a panic or collapsing , would be a crowning achievement for Li &apos;s tenure . 
Another major challenge is managing credit risk . 
Moreover , the government must revitalize the stock of local-government assets and credit by securitizing these portfolios . 
The problem is that China &apos;s domestic capital market remains underdeveloped , owing to administrative restrictions , a non-diverse structure , and a lack of innovation - all of which means that progress in the short term is unlikely . 
This highlights the need for structural reforms aimed at creating a more efficient , open , and competitive capital market , commensurate with the size of the economy . 
A multi-tiered capital market and diverse financial products can help to free China from its excessive dependence on credit . 
But that will require change in the way that the Chinese government manages the macroeconomy .
