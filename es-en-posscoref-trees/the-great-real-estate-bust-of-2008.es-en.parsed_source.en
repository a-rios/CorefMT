The Great Real Estate Bust of 2008 
NEW HAVEN - What brought on the collapse of home prices in 2008 that is the root of the financial crisis now enveloping much of the world ? 
Home prices in the United States , as measured by the Standard ampamp ; 
Poor &apos;s / Case-Shiller Home Price Indices , have plummeted more than 40 % in real inflation-adjusted terms in some major cities since the peak around the beginning of 2006 . 
Nationally , including all cities , the fall is over 25 % . 
The futures market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is now predicting declines of around 15 % more before the prices bottom out in 2010 . 
These are the market &apos;s forecasts - and it is not a very liquid market . 
Why are we seeing such big price drops ? 
And why does the housing market in so many other countries now reflect similar conditions ? 
The answer has both proximate and underlying causes . 
The proximate answer for the US is that a decline in lending standards helped people buy houses at ever-increasing prices before 2006 . 
Freer lending meant that people were freer to bid up prices of homes to ridiculous levels . 
Shacks were selling for a million dollars . 
After the peak , lenders tightened their standards . 
When buyers find it difficult to finance home purchases , sellers have to cut the asking price . 
The up and down of lending represents a credit cycle , and credit cycles have played a major role in economic fluctuations for centuries . 
In his 1873 book Lombard Street , Walter Bagehot , the British businessman and editor of The Economist , described these cycles perfectly . 
The boom just before the depression of the 1870 &quot; s that he described sounds a lot like what happened just before the current crisis . 
When credit expands , he wrote , &quot; The certain result is a bound of national prosperity ; the country leaps forward as if by magic . 
But only part of that prosperity has a solid reason ... this prosperity is precarious . &quot; 
But the credit cycle was not the ultimate cause of the 1870 &quot; s depression or the crisis we are seeing today . 
Ultimately , one must always ask why lending standards were loosened and then tightened . 
The credit cycle is an amplification mechanism . 
The instability in the lending sector is always there , and the crisis manifests itself only if some precipitating factor triggers it . 
Moreover , the extreme weakening and then tightening of credit standards seems particularly prominent only in the US , while the housing boom-bust cycle is prevalent throughout much of the world . 
The precipitating factor that led to the current situation has to do with our evolving world culture , spread rapidly through enhanced media outlets and the Internet , and its perceptions of the markets . 
It has to do with the deep admiration of markets that has developed during the boom , in line with the &quot; efficient markets theory &quot; in academic finance . 
It became widely believed that financial markets are such sublime poolers of information that they represent a collective judgment that transcends that of any mere mortal . 
James Surowiecki &apos;s bestselling 2004 book , with the outrageous title The Wisdom of Crowds , pressed this idea forward at the very height of the real estate boom . 
The boom in the world &apos;s housing markets and stock markets between 2003 and 2006 was caused by this faulty idea , and the idea that investments in homes and equities are a sure route to wealth . 
It had become an article of faith that the value of both types of assets only goes up in the long run , and that it is foolish to try to &quot; time the market . &quot; 
It was sincerely believed , and supported by deep intuitive judgment , that interruptions in this upward trajectory could only be small and transient . 
People seemed to think that rapid appreciation in these markets had become a universal constant , like the speed of light . 
Nothing else ultimately explains lenders &quot; immense willingness , in the boom up to 2006 , to lower their credit standards on home mortgages , regulators &quot; willingness to let them do it , rating agencies &quot; willingness to rate mortgage securities highly , and investors &quot; willingness to gobble them up . 
There is no theory in economics that provides a reason to think that prices in these markets can only go up . 
On the contrary , economic theorists have been puzzled by the historical rate of increase in the stock market , which they call &quot; the equity premium puzzle . &quot; 
They do not have a corresponding name for the behavior of the housing market , because , historically , its prices ( correcting for inflation ) have not generally gone up very much on average , until the post-2000 bubble . 
The booms in these markets can be traced substantially to the growth of the idea that one should always continually hold as many of these assets as possible , just as that you should drink green tea or eat dark chocolate every day for antioxidants . 
Such ideas create artificial demand - but only for a while . 
After all , we no longer smoke cigarettes to prevent infections . 
People will believe many things if they have the impression that the rich and famous believe them , too . 
That is what is happening now , and 2009 will shape up as a year of even more profound disenchantment .
