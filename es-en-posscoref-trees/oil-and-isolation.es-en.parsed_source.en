Oil and Isolation 
NAIROBI - In Kenya , there is a running gag that sums up how far away the Turkana people live from the rest of us . 
When a Turkana man leaves for the capital , Nairobi , the joke goes , he tells his family , &quot; I &apos;m going to Kenya . &quot; 
In recent weeks , ever since Kenya &apos;s government announced that oil had been discovered in the Lake Turkana basin , more jokes have emerged . 
A picture of unidentified happy , half-naked black children I had seen on my Facebook friends &quot; profiles many months ago began circulating again , this time with the caption , &quot; Discover Oil in Turkana ... No More Dry Skin . &quot; 
At first , I chuckled at the jokes . 
As a Maasai , I have heard every Kenyan joke about how &quot; uncivilized &quot; my people are , so I was happy that someone else was in the spotlight for a change . 
But when I saw a photo of a topless Turkana woman doctored to look as if she were breastfeeding a white baby , my attitude began to change . 
The creator of the picture was implying that now that oil has been found in northwestern Kenya , Western oil workers will descend on the region and impregnate Turkana women , perhaps against their will . 
A British company discovered the oil , and , thanks to allegations that British soldiers raped hundreds of Kenyan women from 1965 to 2002 , our former colonial master &apos;s reputation isn &apos;t good . 
But if the rights of the Turkana end up being violated , it will be Kenyans , not the British , who will bear the blame . 
The Turkana people are , as the joke suggests , as far away from Nairobi as one can be without being foreigners . 
For this reason , we know very little about them . 
In schools , we learned about them only within the context of the Leakey family &apos;s decades-long work excavating the Lake Turkana basin in search of fossils of humans &quot; ancestors . 
This could be one reason why Kenyans have historically looked at the Turkana people as archaic beings , millennia away from &quot; civilization &quot; and with different needs from most of the country . 
The lack of adequate infrastructure in the Turkana region is evidence of this . 
Unlike the Maasai , the Turkana inhabit a region that , until now , was of little or no value to the country . 
There are no wild animals to attract tourists , and , although the Turkana , like the Maasai , have preserved their indigenous culture , they are not renowned around the world , perhaps because of their distance from Nairobi . 
Indeed , Turkana is one of Kenya &apos;s most neglected districts . 
Whenever there is a famine , chances are high that Turkana will be affected . 
Gado , a renowned cartoonist for one of Kenya &apos;s leading newspapers , summed it up best , depicting a jubilant Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki leading a pack of bureaucrats and dogs in suits to Turkana to announce to the people , &quot; Rejoice ! 
We have discovered oil ! &quot; 
In addition to famine , the Turkana people have endured decades of raids by cattle rustlers from neighboring Ethiopia and Sudan ( now South Sudan ) . 
Still , Kenya - which has been actively involved in peacekeeping operations in the Horn of Africa region and beyond - has not seen that as a good reason to protect Turkana . 
The discovery of oil presents Kenya with a rare opportunity to end the Turkana community &apos;s marginalization . 
Discussion of how the oil exploration and extraction will proceed needs to start now , and the health of the environment surrounding the Turkana people must be paramount . 
&quot; Pastoralists and indigenous people often rely heavily on their immediate environment for their livelihoods , &quot; says Ikal Angelei , the director of Friends of Lake Turkana , which has been opposing the construction of Gibe III , an Ethiopian dam that threatens to reduce the amount of water flowing to the lake . 
Angelei says , &quot; My fear is that if the oil exploration and drilling happens without community participation , and goes against the communities &quot; expectations , there is a great possibility of conflict . &quot; 
Africa &apos;s numerous resource-driven conflicts validate Angelei &apos;s concerns . 
Some of the precautions that she suggests to safeguard her people &apos;s welfare include establishing a regulatory body that fosters transparency in contract negotiations ; balancing oil production with conservation of the area &apos;s unique biodiversity ; enforcing high standards of corporate responsibility ; and regulating land sales to prevent conflicts . 
Finally , the government should ensure that Turkana people are trained to understand and participate in the new sector . 
If Kenya approaches oil exploration and extraction in Turkana the way my Facebook friends have , and fails to implement these common-sense recommendations , a few years from now Kenyans might be sorry that oil was ever found . 
Indeed , Kenya could end up with a conflict similar to the one in Nigeria &apos;s Niger Delta , where local people took up arms to fight the oil industry &apos;s degradation of their environment . 
Unfortunately , the foundation for such a conflict has already , sadly , been laid . 
Many people in the Lake Turkana region are already armed with AK-47s and other weapons originally intended for protection from cattle rustlers . 
If Kenya &apos;s government fails to protect the Turkana from the oil companies as well , its people might well start shooting .
