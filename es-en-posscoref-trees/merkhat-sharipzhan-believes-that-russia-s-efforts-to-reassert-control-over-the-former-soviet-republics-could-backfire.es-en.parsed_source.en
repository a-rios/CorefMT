Escaping the Bear Hug 
PRAGUE - Three former Soviet republics - Georgia , Moldova , and Ukraine - have now signed association agreements with the European Union , despite Russia &apos;s sometimes brutal attempts to obstruct the process . 
This is certainly a promising development for these countries , all of which have struggled to achieve stability since the Soviet Union &apos;s dissolution . 
But it would be naive to think that Russia will give up so easily . 
As Ukraine &apos;s ongoing crisis has demonstrated yet again , former Soviet republics that attempt to make geopolitical decisions without the Kremlin &apos;s assent do not remain intact for long . 
In Georgia , the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have had de facto independence since receiving Russian recognition in 2008 . 
Today , the prospect of their return seems more distant than ever . 
For its part , Moldova has been struggling for two decades to assert control over the breakaway Transnistria region . 
Moreover , in February , the tiny autonomous region of Gagauzia , with its indigenous Turkic population , announced through a Russia-backed referendum that it has the right to secede if Moldova &quot; loses its statehood . &quot; 
The danger now is that pro-secession leaders may twist the loss of sovereignty supposedly inherent in association with the EU into precisely such a claim . 
Beyond discouraging former Soviet republics from pursuing deeper ties with the EU , Russia has created a sort of &quot; EU &quot; of its own : the Eurasian Economic Union . 
In May , the leaders of Russia , Belarus , and Kazakhstan established the EaEU by signing a treaty that will enter into effect next year , assuming that all three countries &quot; parliaments ratify it . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted that the EaEU is not intended to function as a &quot; resurrected &quot; Soviet Union , but that any former Soviet republic is free to join . 
And some are eager to do so . 
According to a recent poll , some 80 % of Kazakhs support Putin , and about 70 % back Kazakhstan &apos;s EaEU membership . 
Though some countries have persevered in the face of Russia &apos;s threats to bring separatist , ethnic , or other problems to their doorstep should they choose integration with the EU , others have responded to the pressure . 
In September , Armenia , which has been locked in a conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh for more than two decades , suddenly halted its integration talks with the EU and announced its intention to join Russia-led structures . 
Kyrgyzstan , one of the poorest post-Soviet countries in Central Asia , has no obvious separatism-related problems , though it struggles with ethnic tensions in its south , where clashes between local Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in 2010 left more than 400 people dead . 
This month , the country closed the United States &quot; military transit center near Bishkek , and declared its intention to join the customs union that preceded the EaEU by the end of this year . 
The Kremlin is using other mechanisms to exert additional pressure on former Soviet republics . 
Russia &apos;s foreign ministry has just announced that , as of January 1 , citizens of post-Soviet countries that are not members of the customs union and the EaEU will no longer be allowed to enter Russia without passports . 
This will likely soon be followed by visa requirements for these countries &quot; citizens , which for some would pose a major challenge . 
For example , the remittances that the estimated 1.5 million Tajiks who live and work in Russia send to their families back home are critical to Tajikistan &apos;s economy . 
Likewise , in April , Putin signed legislation simplifying the procedure for Russian speakers in former Soviet republics to obtain Russian citizenship . 
The law , enacted just a month after Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea , was undoubtedly intended to provide a legal basis for expediting the citizenship-application process for residents of Crimea and the rest of eastern Ukraine . 
But it may enable millions of other Russian-speaking citizens of EaEU member countries to become Russian citizens , and it could be used to apply pressure on countries like Estonia and Latvia , which have large Russophone populations . 
But the EaEU &apos;s development is not proceeding entirely according to Putin &apos;s plan . 
At a recent Eurasian Economic Commission session in Sochi , Belarus and Kazakhstan rejected the Kremlin &apos;s proposal to introduce customs duties for goods imported from Ukraine if the country signed the EU association agreement . 
The Belarusian government considers it to be Ukraine &apos;s sovereign right to sign agreements with the EU - a flat contradiction of Russia &apos;s stance - and appears likely to introduce customs fees of its own for electronic goods imported from Russia . 
As it stands , the EaEU seems to have two major goals : to obstruct the integration of former Soviet republics into the West , and to help secure Putin &apos;s power . 
Economic advancement does not appear to be on the agenda . 
Unless it somehow manages to deliver tangible economic benefits anyway , the EaEU seems destined to become another failed institutional initiative , like the Commonwealth of Independent States , the Russian-Belarusian Union State , or the Central Asian Union . 
It may even accelerate Russia &apos;s internal decay .
