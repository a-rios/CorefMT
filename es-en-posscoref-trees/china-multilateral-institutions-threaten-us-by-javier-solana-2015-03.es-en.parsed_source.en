China and Global Governance 
MADRID - It is safe to say that the most consequential geostrategic development of the last two decades has been China &apos;s rise . 
Yet the West has failed to accord China - not to mention the other major emerging economies - the degree of influence in today &apos;s global governance structures that it merits . 
This may be about to change . 
Backed by $ 3.8 trillion in currency reserves , China has provided infrastructure investment in exchange for commodities , thereby becoming the world &apos;s largest provider of financing for developing countries , with the China Development Bank already offering more loans than the World Bank . 
But , given that these bilateral arrangements are executed by state-owned corporations , they often do not adhere to international best practices . 
The West has therefore urged China to move toward multilateral processes that meet international standards , while doing more to provide global public goods . 
US President Barack Obama has gone so far as to call China a &quot; free rider &quot; for its failure to fulfill the responsibilities that many would expect of a global power . 
But , if Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s recent foreign-policy initiatives are any indication , change may be imminent . 
Last July , China led the establishment of the New Development Bank by the five BRICS countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) and contributed significantly to its $ 100 billion endowment . 
Likewise , at the latest Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Beijing , China spearheaded the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( AIIB ) . 
And it has established a $ 40 billion Silk Road Fund , to support its ambitions to re-create the ancient overland and maritime routes connecting Asia to Europe . 
In implementing its so-called &quot; one belt , one road &quot; strategy , China will pursue investments affecting some 60 countries - including in Central Asia , where its portfolio already contains projects worth more than $ 50 billion . 
The maritime route will include the Indian Ocean , the South China Sea , and the Mediterranean . 
Together , they will form not just a road , but a network to facilitate the transfer of goods and ideas across Eurasia . 
Europe &apos;s role in this initiative is already emerging with the Greek port of Piraeus , operated partly by the Chinese state-owned naval company COSCO , set to be a stop on the maritime route . 
The Piraeus port will be connected to the rest of Europe by Chinese-financed infrastructure in the Balkans and Hungary , consolidating China &apos;s position as the European Union &apos;s main commercial partner . 
The New Silk Road initiative reaffirms China &apos;s desire to establish itself as a Eurasian power . 
Not only will it connect the dynamic economic hubs of East Asia and Western Europe ; it will also open access to Central Asian countries , where Russia &apos;s influence is in decline . 
It could also help to ease territorial tensions between China and its immediate neighbors . 
So far , China &apos;s efforts to increase its influence seem to be working - and not just in the developing world . 
The United Kingdom recently announced its intention to serve as a founding member of the AIIB , triggering a flood of applications from the likes of Australia , Brazil , France , Germany , Korea , Russia , Turkey , and Spain . 
In the US , however , such developments are perceived as geopolitical setbacks . 
This interpretation is fundamentally flawed . 
After all , China &apos;s decision to bypass the main international financial institutions , which were created in the aftermath of World War II , has been driven by the refusal of the developed countries that lead them to give it a role commensurate with its economic might . 
At the Asian Development Bank , for example , Japan and the US each claim around 13 % of the votes , compared to less than 6 % for China , and the president is always Japanese . 
A similar situation prevails at the World Bank , where an American is always in charge , and the International Monetary Fund , where the managing director is always a European . 
Though the G-20 countries agreed in 2010 to increase China &apos;s IMF quota from 3.65 % to 6.19 % - a small step in the right direction - the US Congress has refused to ratify the agreement , preventing the reforms from being implemented . 
The fact is that China &apos;s new initiatives are not revisionist , but reactive . 
If new powers are not given access to the existing global governance structures , they will create structures of their own . 
This means that the advanced countries have the power to prevent the international order &apos;s fragmentation into ideological and economic blocs - but only if they can overcome their strategic mistrust of China . 
In this sense , the participation of more European countries in the AIIB is a positive development , as it helps to ensure that the new bank complements , rather than rivals , existing institutions . 
( In fact , Europe &apos;s impact would be even greater if the EU , rather than individual members , was represented at the AIIB , as it is at the G-20 and the World Trade Organization . ) 
The West must still do more not only to welcome China to the table of global governance , but also to accept and cooperate with the institutions that the Chinese are now creating . 
Only with an open attitude can Western leaders ensure that Chinese-led institutions adopt best practices of multilateralism and accountability , and that they adhere to international labor and environmental standards . 
Now is the ideal time to initiate this process . 
If the EU , the US , and China take this year to align their intentions , based on their shared interests , they will be prepared to make the most of the G-20 summit in China in 2016 . 
China &apos;s move into multilateral processes is good news for the world . 
They must not squander the opportunity to participate in and shape these processes , so that the benefits are shared as widely as possible .
