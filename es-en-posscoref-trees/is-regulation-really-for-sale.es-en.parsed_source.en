Is Regulation Really for Sale ? 
LONDON - Relationships between London banks and their regulators are not especially warm just now . 
The latest bonus rules issued by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors ( soon to morph into the European Banking Authority ) , have left those sensitive souls on the trading floors feeling rather bruised and unloved . 
In the future , 70 % of their bonuses will have to be deferred . 
Imagine living on only $ 3 million a year , with the other $ 7 million paid only if the profits you earned turn out to be real ? 
It is a shocking turn of events . 
Yet , in narratives of the financial crisis , regulatory capture is often an important part of the story . 
Will Hutton , a prominent British commentator , has described the Financial Services Authority , which I chaired from 1997-2003 ( the date things began to go wrong ! ) as a trade association for the financial sector . 
Even more aggressive criticism has been advanced about American regulators - and , indeed , about Congress - alleging that they were in the pockets of investment banks , hedge funds , and anyone else with lots of money to spend on Capitol Hill . 
How plausible is this argument ? 
Can benign regulation really be bought ? 
When I was a regulator , I would certainly have denied it . 
I had never worked in the financial industry , and knew few people who did . 
( Full disclosure : I am now an independent Director of Morgan Stanley . ) 
My successors have all come from the financial sector , however , which , until recently , was regarded as a sign that they were street-wise . 
Now we are not so sure . 
The consultation processes on rules and regulations were highly structured , and much effort was devoted to ensuring balanced representations from providers and users of financial services . 
We funded research for a Consumer Panel in an effort to ensure &quot; equality of arms . &quot; 
Of course , regulatory staff had more informal links with the industry than with consumers . 
But that is inevitable in any country . 
The industry &apos;s voice was more often heard in Parliament as well . 
The most effective lobbyists were Independent Financial Advisers , who seemed to be especially active in the local Conservative Party associations . 
Goldman Sachs could learn a lot from their tactics ! 
I have no first-hand knowledge of the legislative process in the United States . 
But , as an outsider , I am amazed at the apparent intensity of lobbying , and at the amounts of money that firms and their associations spend . 
Is it effective ? 
The media seem to think so , though with relations between government and industry still only a notch below open warfare , it is difficult to be sure . 
An intriguing sidelight on the relationship between Congress and business is provided in a study by Ahmed Tahoun of the London School of Economics on &quot; The role of stock ownership by US members of Congress on the market for political favors . &quot; 
Tahoun analyzed the relationship between stock owned by congressmen and contributions their political campaigns by the relevant firms , and found a powerful positive association . 
In particular , Tahoun &apos;s research shows that US congressmen systematically invest more in firms that favor their own party , and that when they sell stock , firms stop contributing to their campaigns . 
Moreover , firms with more stock ownership by politicians tend to win more and bigger government contracts . 
The data are not from financial firms alone , and Tahoun has not disaggregated them by sector . 
But the results are of interest nonetheless . 
They suggest a less-than-healthy relationship between lawmakers &quot; political and pecuniary interests . 
Regulators are typically not subject to those temptations . 
They are not normally allowed to own stock in financial firms ( at least in the jurisdictions that I know ) . 
But can they nonetheless be captured ? 
I see two potential grounds for concern . 
The first is the revolving door between the industry and regulatory bodies . 
This is more prevalent in the US , where regulators &quot; salaries are very low , especially in the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission . 
Turnover among senior - and not so senior - people in these agencies is very high . 
The Fed folk are paid a little better , and stay rather longer . 
The United Kingdom pays its regulators more , but there is still a lot of &quot; in and out &quot; activity , and more than there used to be . 
Singapore and Hong Kong have a different model . 
Their regulators are given market-related compensation packages , and continuity of senior staff is more effectively maintained . 
My view is that the Asian financial centers have it right . 
The second concern is what one might call intellectual capture . 
While I would strongly argue that the FSA in my day did not favor firms unduly , it is perhaps true that we - and in this we were exactly like US regulators - were inclined to believe that markets were generally efficient . 
If willing buyers and willing sellers were trading claims happily , then , as long as they were &quot; professional &quot; investors , there was no legitimate reason to interfere in their markets . 
These people were &quot; consenting adults in private , &quot; and the state should avert its gaze . 
We now know that some of these market emperors had no clothes , and that their activities , far from benign , could result in severe financial instability and generate serious losses for taxpayers , not to mention precipitating a global recession . 
That has been a grave lesson for regulators and central banks . 
So intellectual capture is a charge hard to refute . 
But were regulators surrogate lobbyists for the financial industry ? 
I do not think so , and to argue as much devalues the efforts of many overworked and underpaid public servants around the world .
