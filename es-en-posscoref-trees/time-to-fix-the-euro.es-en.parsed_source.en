Time to Fix the Euro 
NEW YORK - The euro suffers from structural deficiencies . 
It has a central bank , but it does not have a central treasury , and the supervision of the banking system is left to national authorities . 
These defects are increasingly making their influence felt , aggravating the financial crisis . 
The process began in earnest after the failure of Lehman Brothers , when on October 12 , 2008 , European finance ministers found it necessary to reassure their publics that no other systemically important financial institution would be allowed to fail . 
In the absence of a central treasury , the task fell to national authorities . 
Eventually , it heightened tensions within the euro zone . 
Most credit in the new member states is provided by euro-zone banks , and most household debt is denominated in foreign currencies . 
As euro-zone banks sought the protection of their home countries by repatriating their capital , East European currencies and bond markets came under pressure , their economies sagged and households &quot; ability to service their debts diminished . 
Banks with large exposure to Eastern Europe found their balance sheets impaired . 
Individual member states &quot; capacity to protect their banks came into question , and the interest-rate spread between different governments &quot; bonds began to widen alarmingly . 
Moreover , national regulators , in their efforts to protect their banks , have unwittingly engaged in &quot; beggar-thy-neighbor &quot; policies . 
All this is contributing to internal tensions . 
At the same time , the unfolding financial crisis has convincingly demonstrated the advantages of a common currency . 
Without it , some members of the euro zone might have found themselves in the same difficulties as Eastern European countries . 
As it is , Greece is hurting less than Denmark , although its fundamentals are much worse . 
The euro may be under stress , but it is here to stay . 
Weaker members will certainly cling to it ; if there is any danger , it comes from its strongest member , Germany . 
Germany &apos;s attitude toward the financial crisis is at odds with that of most of the world , but it is easy to understand why . 
It remains traumatized by its historical memory of the 1930 &quot; s , when runaway inflation in the Weimar Republic led to the rise of Hitler . 
While the rest of the world recognizes that the way to counteract the collapse of credit is to expand the monetary base , Germany remains opposed to any policy that might carry the seeds of eventual inflation . 
Moreover , while Germany has been a steadfast supporter of European integration , it is understandably reluctant to become the deep pocket that finances bailouts in the euro zone . 
Yet the situation cries out for institutional reform , and Germany would benefit from it just as much as the others . 
Creating a euro-zone government bond market would bring immediate benefits , in addition to correcting a structural deficiency . 
For one thing , it would lend credence to the rescue of the banking system and allow additional support to the EU &apos;s newer and more vulnerable members . 
For another , it would serve as a financing mechanism for coordinated countercyclical fiscal policies . 
Properly structured , it would relieve Germany &apos;s anxiety about other countries picking its pocket . 
The euro zone &apos;s bond and bill markets would complement but not replace individual states &quot; existing government bond markets . 
They would be under the control of euro-zone finance ministers . 
The regulation of the financial system would then be put in the hands of the European Central Bank , while the task of guaranteeing and , when necessary , rescuing financial institutions would fall to the finance ministers . 
This would produce a unified and well-supported financial system within the euro zone . 
Even the United Kingdom , which is struggling with an oversized and undercapitalized banking system , might be tempted to join . 
Euro-zone bonds could be used to assist the new EU states that have not yet joined the common currency area . 
They could also serve to increase the EU &apos;s lending capacity beyond the current mandates of the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development . 
The EU could then finance investment programs that combine a countercyclical function with important European objectives , such as an electricity grid , a network of gas and oil pipelines , alternative energy investments , and employment-creating public works in Ukraine . 
All these investments would help break Russia &apos;s stranglehold over Europe . 
The objection that they would take too long to serve a countercyclical purpose can be rejected on the grounds that the recession is also likely to last a long time . 
Two thorny issues would need to be resolved - the allocation of the debt burden among member states , and the relative voting power of the different euro-zone finance ministers . 
Germany would consider the existing precedents , namely the EU &apos;s budget and the composition of the ECB , unfair and unacceptable . 
Although many member states will balk at agreeing to a solution that changes the EU &apos;s internal balance of power , some concessions would be necessary to bring Germany on board . 
Usually it takes a crisis to bring about a compromise , but the crisis is now brewing , and the sooner it is resolved , the better .
