Germany &apos;s Pathological Export Boom 
Germany is the world &apos;s industrial bazaar . 
No other country can offer its international clients such a broad variety of industrial products . 
Germany has 450 hidden world champions for niche products , and is home to 15 of the 20 biggest trade fairs in the world . 
It is also the world &apos;s top exporter of merchandise and the second-largest exporter of goods and services . 
But Germany is gradually becoming a bazaar economy in a different sense , because nowadays it specializes in packaging and selling its products , while outsourcing an ever-larger share of its high value-added manufacturing to low-wage countries . 
In other words , Germany &apos;s role in the world economy is shifting from that of a producer to that of a merchant . 
As a result , its exports contain an ever-increasing share of imported goods and services and the share of domestic value-added in its exports per unit of output is rapidly declining . 
This does not mean that the German-made share of exports is falling in absolute terms . 
It only means that the total volume of German exports has been rising faster than the total German value-added in those exports . 
Is this good or bad ? 
A favorable assessment cannot rest on the fact that the overall German value-added in exports has been growing because this is simply an effect of the German specialization in export-related production . 
When a country specializes in a certain area , capital and labor move into that area at a rate faster than they move into other areas - indeed , the growth of export-related sectors may come at the cost of a decline in other areas . 
Simply put , there is such a thing as excessive specialization . 
To assess whether excessive specialization has occurred in Germany , we must focus on the labor market , for it is here that the effect of specialization is most visible . 
Unfortunately , there is no reason to be optimistic . 
From 1995 to 2004 , Germany lost a total of 1.09 million full-time equivalent jobs in manufacturing and trade . 
At the same time , no new jobs were created in the rest of the economy . 
On the contrary , employment outside manufacturing and trade declined , so that the economy as a whole suffered a net loss of 1.26 million full-time equivalent jobs . 
In fact , since the fall of communism , the percentage decline in German industrial employment has been larger than in any other OECD country . 
In part , this was due to the decline in the former East Germany . 
But even western Germany holds the second-lowest rank of all developed countries . 
The automobile and electrical engineering industries have been at the forefront of the bazaar economy . 
To remain price competitive , they have had to rely on imported components . 
The manufacture of electrical products , such as chips and passive devices , has quite often been shifted completely to Asia , while even automobiles that are still assembled in Germany rely heavily on components produced in Eastern Europe . 
At bottom , the coincidence of unemployment and booming exports can be explained by the high and rigid wages from which Germany still suffers . 
As a consequence of its welfare state and aggressive unions , Germany has had the highest hourly labor costs in the world for most of the last twenty years ; only recently has Denmark taken the lead due to a revaluation of the krona . 
Excessive wages destroy the labor-intensive upstream product stages too fast and also impairs other labor-intensive sectors like textiles , simple services , tourism , and construction . 
As a result , these labor-intensive sectors must release a lot of labor and capital , which push into the capital-intensive export sectors that are better able to cope with high wages . 
But , while these sectors therefore grow especially fast , their high capital intensity means that they cannot fully employ the released labor , with the result that some of the unemployed workers have nowhere to turn but the welfare state . 
At the same time , since returns to capital are kept low by high wages , very little investment occurs . 
The excess of savings over investment flows abroad as capital exports . 
Economic growth and job creation slow , while exports soar . 
Astonishingly , many interpret Germany &apos;s export boom and current-account surplus , which measures these capital exports , as an indicator of the strength of Germany as an investment location . 
But , according to the Bundesbank , net investment abroad ( including financial investment ) has already roughly matched domestic investment in recent years . 
As the international division of labor proceeds further , the import content of German products will continue to increase , which means that rising exports will lead to fewer domestic jobs and less income growth . 
Unless and until German workers accept the need for greater flexibility in the face of global competition , export profits will continue to be invested abroad , reducing overall production costs - and reinforcing the bazaar economy at home .
