Back-to-School Letter to the US Congress 
NEWPORT BEACH - What if members of the United States Congress , now returning from their summer recess , were to receive a &quot; back to school &quot; letter from concerned citizens ? 
Here is what a first draft might look like . 
Dear Member of Congress : 
Welcome back to the Capitol . 
We hope that you had a good summer break , and that you return to Washington not just rested , but also energized to take on our country &apos;s mounting economic challenges . 
The news has been mixed during your absence . 
We have seen some improvement in economic data , but not enough to suggest that we are any closer to overcoming decisively this painful period of low growth and high unemployment . 
And , with a self-inflicted fiscal cliff looming - one that could send our country back into recession , pulling the rest of the world with us - businesses are reluctant to hire and invest in new capital goods . 
Fortunately , the Federal Reserve has signaled its intention to remain active , but its policy tools are poorly suited to the challenges that we face . 
Meanwhile , global difficulties remain substantial . 
We continue to face strong headwinds originating from the deepening European debt crisis , as well as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East . 
China , once the world &apos;s unstoppable growth engine , is slowing . 
And , despite all the happy talk , multilateral policy coordination is essentially non-existent . 
All of this calls for courageous and visionary economic leadership ; otherwise , our problems will fester and grow , and the solutions will become even more complex . 
Already , too many of our economy &apos;s difficulties , including worrisome trends in youth joblessness and long-term unemployment , risk becoming structurally embedded . 
No doubt you have also noticed that , with less than ten weeks to go until the November presidential election , our country is in the grip of an increasingly ugly political campaign . 
So , with this combination of bad economics and bad politics , we look to you for direction and leadership . 
It is that simple , and that important . 
We need you to overcome a prolonged period of congressional paralysis and polarization in order to address the country &apos;s malaise . 
We need you to pivot in your responses from the tactical to the strategic , from the cyclical to the secular , from the partial to the comprehensive , and from sequential to simultaneous reforms . 
If this call to national duty is not enough , we would remind you of your own self-interest . 
According to the latest NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll , your support among us , the electorate , stands at just 12 % . 
We concede that there is no magic wand to overcome our country &apos;s problems . 
After all , for too many years leading up to the global financial crisis , America &quot; bought &quot; and &quot; borrowed &quot; its growth by leveraging balance sheets , rather than &quot; earning &quot; it through increased competitiveness . 
The result was massive misallocation of human resources , insufficient infrastructure investment , over-reliance on credit entitlements , and , of course , unsustainable debt . 
To make matters worse , this occurred at a time when systemically important emerging economies hit their &quot; developmental breakout phase , &quot; powered by trade and other aspects of globalization . 
We do not expect you to solve America &apos;s problems overnight . 
Instead , we look to you to embark on an appropriate and sustainable policy path . 
So , as you unpack your bags and renew old friendships and rivalries , please keep the following in mind . 
Changing course requires that you , together with the president , have a much more open and consistent economic dialogue with us , the general public , about the challenges that we face . 
It also requires that you and the president converge on a multi-prong , multi-year policy initiative that , at a minimum , makes simultaneous advances in six critical areas : 
· Fiscal reform : We desperately need you to eliminate the looming fiscal cliff in the context of medium-term reforms of both the tax system and entitlements . 
This would also allow for greater fiscal stimulus at a time when other components of aggregate demand are slowing . 
· Labor-market reform : Persistently high unemployment and large-scale withdrawal from the labor force are a constant reminder of a malfunctioning labor market that needs support through better training and retooling . 
Reform must also address the related challenges of a lagging education system and an insufficient social safety net . 
· Housing and housing finance : At the root of the global financial crisis , the troubled US housing market continues to act as a millstone around the economy &apos;s neck . 
The longer the problems persist , the greater the pressure on consumer and business sentiment , and the harder it is for the unemployed to find and relocate to new job opportunities . 
· Clogged credit pipes : With banks &quot; balance sheets contracting , too many small and medium-size companies are unable to mobilize credit for investment and growth . 
Recognizing that it will take years until banks are properly stabilized , America needs to build new conduits for credit . 
· Infrastructure : Those of you who have traveled abroad know that our infrastructure is desperately lagging that of a growing number of countries . 
This makes it even harder for our companies to compete and prosper . 
· Global policy coordination : America &apos;s traditional leadership role has evaporated in recent years as our problems have made us more insular and inward-looking . 
This would not be a major problem if the resulting vacuum had been filled . 
But that has not happened . 
On the contrary , the G-7 has lost relevance , the International Monetary Fund is hampered by its representation and legitimacy deficits , and the G-20 is still finding its feet . 
Engineering such an agenda is not an overwhelming challenge . 
But that will provide little comfort if you , our elected representatives , do not collaborate effectively . 
The choice Congress faces this term is simple : either address head on America &apos;s challenges , or risk being remembered as the body whose dithering condemned future generations to being worse off than their parents . 
Yours sincerely , 
Concerned citizens
