Angela Merkel &apos;s Pyrrhic Victory 
BUDAPEST - As far as Germany is concerned , the drama of the euro crisis is over . 
The subject was barely discussed in the country &apos;s recent election campaign . 
Chancellor Angela Merkel did what was necessary to ensure the euro &apos;s survival , and she did so at the least possible cost to Germany - a feat that earned her the support of pro-European Germans as well as those who trust her to protect German interests . 
Not surprisingly , she won re-election resoundingly . 
But it was a Pyrrhic victory . 
The eurozone status quo is neither tolerable nor stable . 
Mainstream economists would call it an inferior equilibrium ; 
I call it a nightmare - one that is inflicting tremendous pain and suffering that could be easily avoided if the misconceptions and taboos that sustain it were dispelled . 
The problem is that the debtor countries feel all the pain , while the creditors impose the misconceptions and taboos . 
One example is Eurobonds , which Merkel has declared taboo . 
Yet they are the obvious solution to the root cause of the euro crisis , which is that joining the euro exposed member countries &quot; government bonds to the risk of default . 
Normally , developed countries never default , because they can always print money . 
But , by ceding that authority to an independent central bank , the eurozone &apos;s members put themselves in the position of a developing country that has borrowed in foreign currency . 
Neither the authorities nor the markets recognized this prior to the crisis , attesting to the fallibility of both . 
When the euro was introduced , the authorities actually declared member states &quot; government bonds to be riskless . 
Commercial banks could hold them without setting aside any capital reserves , and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) accepted them on equal terms at its discount window . 
This created a perverse incentive for commercial banks to buy the weaker governments &quot; debt in order to earn what eventually became just a few basis points , as interest-rate differentials converged to practically zero . 
But interest-rate convergence caused economic divergence . 
The weaker countries enjoyed real-estate , consumption , and investment booms , while Germany , weighed down by the fiscal burden of reunification , had to adopt austerity and implement structural reforms . 
That was the origin of the euro crisis , but it was not recognized at the time - and is not properly understood even today . 
Converting all outstanding government bonds - with the exception of Greece &apos;s - into Eurobonds would be by far the best remedy . It would require no transfer payments , because each country would remain responsible for servicing its own debt . 
And it would impose stricter market discipline on debtor countries than they currently face , because they could issue Eurobonds only to refinance maturing ones ; any additional borrowing would have to be in their own name , and markets would impose penalty rates for excessive borrowing . 
Yet Eurobonds would substantially reduce the heavily indebted countries &quot; borrowing costs and go a long way to reestablishing a level playing field in the eurozone . 
Germany &apos;s credit rating would not be endangered , because Eurobonds would compare favorably with bonds issued by other major countries . 
Eurobonds would not cure disparities in competitiveness ; eurozone countries would still need to undertake their own structural reforms . 
All the alternatives are inferior : they either involve transfer payments , perpetuate an uneven playing field , or both . 
And yet , owing to Merkel &apos;s opposition , Eurobonds cannot even be considered . 
Greece , too , is a victim of its creditors &quot; misconceptions and taboos . 
Everyone knows that it can never pay back its debt , most of which is held by the official sector : the ECB , eurozone member states , or the International Monetary Fund . 
After undergoing a lot of pain and suffering , Greece is close to posting a primary budget surplus . 
If the official sector could forgo repayment as long as Greece meets the conditions imposed by the Troika ( the ECB , the European Commission , and the IMF ) , private capital would return and the economy could recover rapidly . 
I can testify from personal experience that investors would flock to Greece once the debt overhang was removed . 
But the official sector cannot write down its debt , because that would violate a number of taboos , particularly for the ECB . 
Germany would do well to remember that it has benefited from debt write-downs three times in its history . 
The Dawes Plan of 1924 sought to stagger Germany &apos;s reparations payments for World War I. The Young Plan of 1929 reduced the sum that Germany owed in reparations and gave the country much more time to pay . 
The post-World War II Marshall Plan provided debt relief as well . 
French insistence on harsh reparations payments after World War I clearly prepared the ground for the rise of Hitler . 
The rise of Greece &apos;s neo-fascist Golden Dawn is a similar phenomenon . 
These two examples justify my description of the euro crisis as a nightmare . 
Only Germany can end it , because , as the country with the highest credit rating and largest and strongest economy by far , it is in charge . 
Germany , mindful of its recent history , does not want to be cast in the role of a hegemonic power ; the current situation is not the result of some evil German plot . 
Still , Germany cannot escape the responsibilities and liabilities that go with that role . 
It must learn to act as a benign hegemon . 
Doing so would earn Germany the lasting gratitude of the countries that are currently subordinated to it , just as the Marshall Plan earned the United States the lasting gratitude of Europe . 
Failure to seize this moment would , I believe , lead to the disintegration and eventual collapse of the European Union . 
Of course , many countries have lived through nightmares and survived . 
But the EU is not a country ; it is an incomplete association of sovereign states that will not survive a decade or more of stagnation . 
That is not in Germany &apos;s interest , and it would leave Europeans worse off than they were when they embarked on the EU project . 
Making a U-turn is never easy for political leaders , but elections do provide an opportunity for a policy change . 
The best way to make one would be for Merkel &apos;s next government to appoint an independent expert commission to evaluate the alternatives , without regard to the prevailing taboos .
