A New Year &apos;s Banking Union 
BRUSSELS - Five years after the outbreak of the financial crisis , Europe &apos;s economic and political situation remains fragile . 
A mild recession is expected in Europe this year , and unemployment is on the rise . 
Beyond deficit reduction , we need to implement a € 120 billion ( $ 155 billion ) European investment plan , and deepen the European Single Market to unleash its growth potential . 
But we also need other structural measures . 
The European Union must put an end to the negative feedback loop between individual member states and their national banking systems . 
Between 2008 and 2011 , EU taxpayers granted banks € 4.5 trillion in loans and guarantees . 
In some countries , the threat of bank recapitalization with public funds has resulted in a drop in market confidence and a huge rise in interest rates . 
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) has taken decisive action to break this vicious circle . 
The European Commission has proposed a single rulebook for banks &quot; capital requirements ; mutual support between national deposit guarantee schemes ; and Europe-wide rules for resolving failing banks that place the main burden on bank shareholders and creditors , not on taxpayers . 
On June 29 , European heads of state and government committed themselves to the creation of a single European supervisor for banks in the eurozone . 
This is good news for both financial stability and public finances : once the single supervisor is in place , supervision will be more credible and impartial , which is important for dealing with ailing banks and managing their return to viability . 
The European Commission also put forward a set of legislative proposals to establish the single supervisory mechanism and confer key supervisory tasks on the ECB . 
This proposal must now be amended and approved as soon as possible by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers if we are to have a chance of activating the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) and proceeding with the other essential pillars of a banking union . 
Further work , however , is still needed in several areas : 
The scope of the new supervisory mechanism . 
Some member states favor restricting European supervision to systemically important banks . 
But the Commission believes that it should cover all 6,000 banks in the eurozone . 
After all , &quot; systemically important &quot; is impossible to define . 
The failures of banks like Northern Rock , Dexia , and Bankia are reminders that small and medium-size banks can endanger the entire financial system . 
And it would be inherently unstable to have two supervisory mechanisms for banks operating in the same market.The participation of non-eurozone countries in the new supervisory scheme . 
The Commission &apos;s proposal confers powers on the ECB for the supervision of all banks in the eurozone . 
For non-eurozone countries , the proposals provide for a mechanism to join on a voluntary basis and submit to the ECB &apos;s authority . 
But the EU treaties make it complicated to give these non-eurozone countries full voting powers . 
I do not see any political problem with giving these countries a full voice in shaping the decisions of the European supervisor , but creativity will be needed to find a legally sound and fair solution.National supervisors &quot; role in the new system . 
Clearly , the European Council has decided on a paradigm shift : powers are moving to the ECB . 
But national supervisors will be members of the board that will take key decisions , which they will prepare and implement . 
In the current negotiations , we can still fine-tune the roles of the European and national supervisors , but ultimate authority must rest with the ECB.Non-eurozone EU members that do not want to join the single supervisory mechanism . 
These countries have expressed concerns about the new powers conferred on the ECB . 
In particular , they question the ECB &apos;s voting rights within the European Banking Authority , which will remain in charge of developing a single rulebook for all 27 countries in the EU &apos;s single market and enhancing convergence of supervisory practices . 
We need to find ways to preserve fully the influence of non-eurozone countries within the European Banking Authority.Democratic accountability for the ECB &apos;s new supervisory powers . 
The ECB must , of course , maintain its full monetary-policy independence , despite its new role . 
So a key question is how , in addition to giving an important role to the European Parliament , national parliaments can play their part in overseeing supervisory decisions.Timing. 
According to some EU countries , the Commission &apos;s proposal is too ambitious to enter into force at the beginning of 2013 . 
But an effective single banking supervisor is a prerequisite for the ESM &apos;s direct recapitalization of banks . 
Only with this possibility and strong unified supervision will Europe be in a position to break the vicious circle between banks &quot; balance-sheet weakness and sovereign debt , and thus resolve the eurozone crisis.Entry into force in January 2013 would bring about supervision by the ECB of banks that have received or requested public funding . 
Only in July 2013 would all banks of major systemic importance be subject to ECB supervision . 
The remaining banks would be subject to the new mechanism at the start of 2014 . 
Intense discussions are normal for such a high-stakes project . 
Countries like Germany , Finland , and the Netherlands are right to argue that rapid progress cannot come at the expense of the new supervisory structure &apos;s quality . 
But EU countries have to stick to the commitment that they made in June and strike a deal in time for a gradual entry into force in January 2013 .
