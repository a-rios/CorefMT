Truth from the Top 
WASHINGTON , DC - It is unusual for a senior government official to produce a short , clear analytical paper . 
It is even rarer when the official &apos;s argument both cuts to the core of the issue and amounts to a devastating critique of the existing order . 
In a speech delivered on February 24 , Thomas M. Hoenig , Vice Chairman of America &apos;s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , did exactly that . 
These four pages are a must-read not only for economic policymakers around the world , but also for anyone who cares about where the global financial system is heading . 
Hoenig , former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City , has spent his career working on issues related to financial regulation . 
He communicates effectively to a broad audience - and understanding the technicalities of finance is not needed to grasp his main points . 
One of those points is that the world &apos;s largest financial firms have equity that is worth only about 4 % of their total assets . 
As shareholders &quot; equity is the only real buffer against losses in these corporations , this means that a 4 % decline in their assets &quot; value would completely wipe out their shareholders - taking the companies to the brink of insolvency . 
In other words , this is a fragile system . 
Worse , the current regulatory treatment of derivatives and of funding for large complex financial institutions - the global megabanks - exacerbates this fragility . 
Perhaps we are moving in the right direction - that is , toward greater stability - but Hoenig is skeptical about the pace of progress . 
As he points out , the relevant studies show that the megabanks receive large implicit government subsidies , and this encourages them to stay big - and to take on a lot of risk . 
In principle , such subsidies are supposed to be phased out through measures being taken as a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation . 
In practice , these subsidies - and the politics that makes them possible - are firmly entrenched . 
The facts may startle you . 
In 1984 , the US had a relatively stable financial system in which small , medium , and - in that day - what were considered large banks had roughly equal shares in US financial assets . 
( See Hoenig &apos;s chart for precise definitions . ) 
Since the mid-1980 &quot; s , big banks &quot; share in credit allocation has increased dramatically - and what it means to be &quot; big &quot; has changed , so that the largest banks are much bigger relative to the size of the economy ( measured , for example , by annual GDP ) . 
As Hoenig says , &quot; If even one of the largest five banks were to fail , it would devastate markets and the economy . &quot; 
The Dodd-Frank legislation specifies that all banks - of any size - should be able to go bankrupt without causing massive disruption . 
If the authorities - specifically the Federal Reserve and the FDIC - determine that this is not possible , they have the legal power to force the banks to change how they operate , including by reducing their scale and scope . 
But the current reality is that no megabank could go bankrupt without causing another &quot; Lehman moment &quot; - that is , the kind of global panic that resulted in the days after Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008 . 
In particular , experts like Hoenig who have thought about the cross-border dimensions of bankruptcy emphasize that it simply would not work for a corporation the size of JPMorgan Chase ( $ 3.7 trillion in assets ) , Bank of America ( $ 3 trillion ) , or Citigroup ( $ 2.7 trillion ) . 
&quot; Panic is about panic , &quot; Hoenig says , &quot; and people and nations generally protect themselves and their wealth ahead of others . 
Moreover , there are no international bankruptcy laws to govern such matters and prevent the grabbing of assets . &quot; 
I would add that the chance of bankruptcy courts cooperating across borders in this context is nil . 
As a result , the Federal Reserve and the FDIC should move immediately to force the megabanks to become much simpler legal entities . 
Current corporate structures are opaque , with the risks hidden around the world - and various shell games allowing companies to claim the same equity in more than one country . 
Breaking down the components of banks into manageable pieces makes sense . 
The Federal Reserve has recently taken a step in that direction by requiring that global banks with a significant presence in the US operate there through a holding company that is well-capitalized by US standards . 
This is not about preventing the flow of capital around the world . 
It is about making the financial system safer . Anyone who disputes the need to do this - and much more - should read and respond to Hoenig .
