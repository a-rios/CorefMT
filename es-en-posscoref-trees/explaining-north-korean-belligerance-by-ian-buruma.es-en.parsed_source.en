The Trouble with North Korea 
NEW YORK - Nobody would care much about North Korea - a small and isolated country of 24 million people , ruled by a grotesque dynasty that calls itself communist - if it were not for its nuclear weapons . 
Its current ruler , Kim Jong-un , the 30-year-old grandson of North Korea &apos;s founder and &quot; Great Leader , &quot; is now threatening to turn Seoul , the rich and bustling capital of South Korea , into &quot; a sea of fire . &quot; 
American military bases in Asia and the Pacific are also on his list of targets . 
Kim knows very well that a war against the United States would probably mean the destruction of his own country , which is one of the world &apos;s poorest . 
His government cannot even feed its own people , who are regularly devastated by famine . 
In the showcase capital , Pyongyang , there is not even enough electricity to keep the lights on in the largest hotels . 
So threatening to attack the world &apos;s most powerful country would seem like an act of madness . 
But it is neither useful nor very plausible to assume that Kim Jong-un and his military advisers are mad . 
To be sure , there is something deranged about North Korea &apos;s political system . 
The Kim family &apos;s tyranny is based on a mixture of ideological fanaticism , vicious realpolitik , and paranoia . 
The short history of North Korea is fairly simple . 
After the collapse in 1945 of the Japanese empire , which had ruled quite brutally over the whole of Korea since 1910 , the Soviet Red Army occupied the north , and the US occupied the south . 
The Soviets plucked a relatively obscure Korean communist , Kim Il-sung , from an army camp in Vladivostok , and installed him in Pyongyang as the leader of North Korea . 
Myths about his wartime heroism and divine status soon followed , and a cult of personality was established . 
Worshipping Kim , and his son and grandson , as Korean gods became part of a state religion . 
North Korea is essentially a theocracy . 
Some elements are borrowed from Stalinism and Maoism , but much of the Kim cult owes more to indigenous forms of shamanism : human gods who promise salvation ( it is no accident that the Reverend Sun Myung Moon and his Unification Church came from Korea , too ) . 
But the power of the Kim cult , as well as the paranoia that pervades the North Korean regime , has a political history that goes back much further than 1945 . 
Wedged awkwardly between China , Russia , and Japan , the Korean Peninsula has long been a bloody battleground for greater powers . 
Korean rulers only managed to survive by playing one foreign power off against the other , and by offering subservience , mainly to Chinese emperors , in exchange for protection . 
This legacy has nurtured a passionate fear and loathing of dependency on stronger countries . 
The Kim dynasty &apos;s main claim to legitimacy is Juche , the regime &apos;s official ideology , which stresses national self-reliance to the point of autarky . 
In fact , Kim Il-sung and his son , Kim Jong-il , were typical Korean rulers . 
They played China against the Soviet Union , while securing the protection of both . 
Of course , this did not stop North Korean propagandists from accusing the South Koreans of being cowardly lackeys of US imperialism . 
Indeed , paranoia about US imperialism is part of the cult of independence . 
For the Kim dynasty to survive , the threat of external enemies is essential . 
The fall of the Soviet Union was a disaster for North Korea , as it was for Cuba ; not only did Soviet economic support evaporate , but the Kims could no longer play off one power against another . 
Only China was left , and North Korea &apos;s dependence on its northern neighbor is now almost total . 
China could crush North Korea in a day just by cutting off food and fuel supplies . 
There is only one way to divert attention from this humiliating predicament : propaganda about self-reliance and the imminent threat from US imperialists and their South Korean lackeys must be turned up to a hysterical pitch . 
Without this orchestrated paranoia , the Kims have no legitimacy . 
Some people argue that the US could enhance security in northeast Asia by compromising with the North Koreans - specifically , by promising not to attack or attempt to topple the Kim regime . 
The Americans are unlikely to agree to this , and South Korea would not want them to . 
Apart from anything else , there is an important domestic political reason for US reticence : a Democratic US president cannot afford to look &quot; soft . &quot; 
More important , even if the US were to provide such guarantees to North Korea , the regime &apos;s paranoid propaganda would probably continue , given the centrality to Juche of fear of the outside world . 
The tragedy of Korea is that no one really wishes to change the status quo : China wants to keep North Korea as a buffer state , and fears millions of refugees in the event of a North Korean collapse ; the South Koreans could never afford to absorb North Korea in the way that West Germany absorbed the broken German Democratic Republic ; and neither Japan nor the US would relish paying to clean up after a North Korean implosion , either . 
And so an explosive situation will remain explosive , North Korea &apos;s population will continue to suffer famines and tyranny , and words of war will continue to fly back and forth across the 38th parallel . 
So far , they are just words .
