The Jewish Conspiracy in Asia 
TOKYO - A Chinese bestseller , entitled The Currency War , describes how Jews are planning to rule the world by manipulating the international financial system . 
The book is reportedly read in the highest government circles . 
If so , this does not bode well for the international financial system , which relies on well-informed Chinese to help it recover from the current crisis . 
Such conspiracy theories are not rare in Asia . 
Japanese readers have shown a healthy appetite over the years for books such as To Watch Jews Is To See the World Clearly , The Next Ten Years : How to Get an Inside View of the Jewish Protocols , and I &apos;d Like to Apologize To the Japanese - A Jewish Elder &apos;s Confession ( written by a Japanese author , of course , under the made-up name of Mordecai Mose ) . 
All these books are variations of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , the Russian forgery first published in 1903 , which Japanese came across after defeating the Czar &apos;s army in 1905 . 
The Chinese picked up many modern Western ideas from the Japanese . 
Perhaps this is how Jewish conspiracy theories were passed on as well . 
The former prime minister of Malaysia , Mahathir Bin Mohammed , has said that &quot; the Jews rule the world by proxy . 
They get others to fight and die for them . &quot; 
In the case of Mahathir , a twisted kind of Muslim solidarity is probably at work . 
No Chinese or Japanese has blamed Jews for killing their holy men or believed that their children &apos;s blood ended up in Passover matzos . 
In fact , few Chinese , Japanese , Malaysians , or Filipinos have ever seen a Jew , unless they have spent time abroad . 
So what explains the remarkable appeal of Jewish conspiracy theories in Asia ? 
The answer must be partly political . 
Conspiracy theories thrive in relatively closed societies , where free access to news is limited and freedom of enquiry curtailed . 
Japan is no longer such a closed society , yet even people with a short history of democracy are prone to believe that they are victims of unseen forces . 
Precisely because Jews are relatively unknown , therefore mysterious , and in some way associated with the West , they become an obvious fixture of anti-Western paranoia . 
Such paranoia is widespread in Asia , where almost every country was at the mercy of Western powers for several hundred years . 
Japan was never formally colonized , but it , too , felt the West &apos;s dominance , at least since the 1850 &quot; s , when American ships laden with heavy guns forced the country to open its borders on Western terms . 
The common conflation of the US with Jews goes back to the late nineteenth century , when European reactionaries loathed America for being a rootless society based only on financial greed . 
Hence the idea that Jews run America . 
One of the great ironies of colonial history is the way in which colonized people adopted some of the very prejudices that justified colonial rule . 
Anti-Semitism arrived with a whole package of European race theories that have persisted in Asia well after they fell out of fashion in the West . 
In some ways , Chinese minorities in Southeast Asia have shared some of the hostility suffered by Jews in the West . 
Excluded from many occupations , they , too , survived by clannishness and trade . 
They , too , have been persecuted for not being &quot; sons of the soil . &quot; 
So when things go wrong , the Chinese are blamed , not just for being greedy capitalists , but also , again like the Jews , for being Communists , since both capitalism and communism are associated with rootlessness and cosmopolitanism . 
As well as being feared , the Chinese are admired for being cleverer than everybody else . 
The same mixture of fear and awe is often evident in people &apos;s views of the US , and , indeed , of the Jews . 
Japanese anti-Semitism is a particularly interesting case . 
Japan was able to defeat Russia in 1905 only after a Jewish banker in New York , Jacob Schiff , helped Japan by floating bonds . 
As a result , during World War Two , even as the Germans were asking their Japanese allies to round up Jews and hand them over , dinners were held in Japanese-occupied Manchuria to celebrate Japanese-Jewish friendship . 
Jewish refugees in Shanghai , though never comfortable , at least remained alive under Japanese protection . 
This was good for the Jews of Shanghai .
