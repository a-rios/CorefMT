Inequality and the American Child 
NEW YORK - Children , it has long been recognized , are a special group . 
They do not choose their parents , let alone the broader conditions into which they are born . 
They do not have the same abilities as adults to protect or care for themselves . 
That is why the League of Nations approved the Geneva Declaration on the Rights of the Child in 1924 , and why the international community adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 . 
Sadly , the United States is not living up to its obligations . 
In fact , it has not even ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child . 
The US , with its cherished image as a land of opportunity , should be an inspiring example of just and enlightened treatment of children . 
Instead , it is a beacon of failure - one that contributes to global sluggishness on children &apos;s rights in the international arena . 
Though an average American childhood may not be the worst in the world , the disparity between the country &apos;s wealth and the condition of its children is unparalleled . 
About 14.5 % of the American population as a whole is poor , but 19.9 % of children - some 15 million individuals - live in poverty . 
Among developed countries , only Romania has a higher rate of child poverty . 
The US rate is two-thirds higher than that in the United Kingdom , and up to four times the rate in the Nordic countries . 
For some groups , the situation is much worse : more than 38 % of black children , and 30 % of Hispanic children , are poor . 
None of this is because Americans do not care about their children . 
It is because America has embraced a policy agenda in recent decades that has caused its economy to become wildly unequal , leaving the most vulnerable segments of society further and further behind . 
The growing concentration of wealth - and a significant reduction in taxes on it - has meant less money to spend on investments for the public good , like education and the protection of children . 
As a result , America &apos;s children have become worse off . 
Their fate is a painful example of how inequality not only undermines economic growth and stability - as economists and organizations like the International Monetary Fund are finally acknowledging - but also violates our most cherished notions of what a fair society should look like . 
Income inequality is correlated with inequalities in health , access to education , and exposure to environmental hazards , all of which burden children more than other segments of the population . 
Indeed , nearly one in five poor American children are diagnosed with asthma , a rate 60 % higher than non-poor children . 
Learning disabilities occur almost twice as frequently among children in households earning less than $ 35,000 a year than they do in households earning more than $ 100,000 . 
And some in the US Congress want to cut food stamps - on which some 23 million American households depend , threatening the poorest children with hunger . 
These inequalities in outcomes are closely tied to inequalities in opportunities . 
Inevitably , in countries where children have inadequate nutrition , insufficient access to health care and education , and higher exposure to environmental hazards , the children of the poor will have far different life prospects from those of the rich . 
And , partly because an American child &apos;s lifetime prospects are more dependent on his or her parents &quot; income and education than in other advanced countries , the US now has the least equality of opportunity of any advanced country . 
At America &apos;s most elite universities , for example , only around 9 % of students come from the bottom half of the population , while 74 % come from the top quarter . 
Most societies recognize a moral obligation to help ensure that young people can live up to their potential . 
Some countries even impose a constitutional mandate for equality of educational opportunities . 
But in America , more is spent on the education of rich students than on the education of the poor . 
As a result , the US is wasting some of its most valuable assets , with some young people - bereft of skills - turning to dysfunctional activities . 
American states like California spend about as much on prisons as on higher education - and sometimes more . 
Without compensatory measures - including pre-school education , ideally beginning at a very young age - unequal opportunities translate into unequal lifelong outcomes by the time children reach the age of five . 
That should be a spur to policy action . 
Indeed , while inequality &apos;s harmful effects are wide-reaching , and impose huge costs on our economies and societies , they are largely avoidable . 
The extremes of inequality observed in some countries are not the inexorable result of economic forces and laws . 
The right policies - stronger social safety nets , progressive taxation , and better regulation ( especially of the financial sector ) , to name a few - can reverse these devastating trends . 
To generate the political will that such reforms require , we must confront policymakers &quot; inertia and inaction with the grim facts of inequality and its devastating effects on our children . 
We can reduce childhood deprivation and increase equality of opportunity , thereby laying the groundwork for a more just and prosperous future - one that reflects our own avowed values . 
So why don &apos;t we ? 
Of the harm that inequality inflicts on our economies , politics , and societies , the damage done to children demands special concern . 
Whatever responsibility poor adults may bear for their lot in life - they may not have worked hard enough , saved enough , or made good decisions - children &apos;s circumstances are thrust upon them without any sort of choice . 
Children , perhaps more than anyone , need the protection that rights afford - and the US should be providing the world with a shining example of what that means .
