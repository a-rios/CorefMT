Europe Is Still Standing 
BRUSSELS - Judging from the headlines , one might get the impression that the 400 million citizens eligible to participate in the recent European Parliament elections voted massively against the European Union . 
True , anti-establishment , mostly Euroskeptic , parties won about one-fifth of the vote . 
But to characterize the election result as a rejection of Europe simply is not quite accurate ( or fair ) . 
For starters , although much has been made of the argument that the EU is too far removed from its citizens , opinion polls have shown consistently that public trust in the major European institutions remains higher than trust in national institutions . 
Across the EU , the European Parliament still has higher approval ratings , on average , than national parliaments . 
Although the trust gap has narrowed somewhat in recent years , even the continuing recession , which is often blamed on EU-imposed austerity and the crisis in the eurozone , has only marginally reduced the European Parliament &apos;s advantage over national parliaments . 
Recent polls suggest that , across Europe , about 40 % of the population still trust the European Parliament , whereas only 25 % trust their national parliaments . 
Moreover , the European Parliament retains much higher trust than the US Congress , which has approval ratings that are now below 10 % . 
Given the general loss of trust in parliamentary institutions on both sides of the Atlantic , the European Parliament is doing relatively well . 
Moreover , not all protest parties reject the EU . 
In Europe &apos;s crisis-affected countries , young people , who have been hardest hit , voted en masse for leftist &quot; anti-austerity &quot; parties , most notably in Greece . 
But these parties do not reject the EU . 
On the contrary , they want more solidarity from the EU , which would enable their governments to spend more . 
The anti-austerity protest vote is strongest where governments have been unable to implement reforms effectively ( for example , in Greece ) , in contrast to Portugal and Spain , whose economies are recovering on the back of strong exports . 
In Italy , Prime Minister Matteo Renzi &apos;s new government has been able to stem the tide of Euroskepticism by undertaking concrete reforms and not blaming the EU for every problem the country faces . 
The rejection of the EU seems more fundamental in parts of northern Europe , where the elderly tend to vote for right-wing populist parties . 
Especially in the United Kingdom and France , unemployment and a perceived lack of control over borders have played a large role in fostering disaffection with the EU . 
This is particularly worrying , given that both countries &quot; problems have little to do with EU policies . 
France &apos;s economic malaise cannot be blamed on austerity imposed from Brussels , and the UK is not even in the eurozone . 
Populists in both countries campaigned successfully on non-issues . 
All available studies show that &quot; welfare tourism &quot; is a limited phenomenon , and that immigration fosters economic growth . 
But these facts do not count when wages are stagnating ( as in the UK ) or unemployment continues to rise ( as in France ) . 
Populists can easily project these problems onto &quot; Europe , &quot; which in this case merely represents fear of the outside world in general . 
The EU is thus caught between demands for more solidarity from the young in its southern members and dissatisfaction with open borders among the elderly in the north . 
It is tempting to try to mollify both groups by relaxing austerity and ditching the border-free Schengen area . 
But that is unlikely to swing the political pendulum back toward Europe , especially in countries like France and the UK . 
The deeper roots of the surge of Euroskeptic and other protest parties originate with the general dissatisfaction with the state of the economy and dysfunctional national political systems . 
Tinkering with austerity or the fundamental right of free movement within the EU will not make much of a difference . 
Reform is needed at home , in national capitals . 
In this context , the selection of the European Commission &apos;s next president - now the focus of considerable attention - is a sideshow . 
Whoever is chosen will be able to make the EU work only if French President Fran√ßois Hollande can build a domestic pro-reform consensus and British Prime Minister David Cameron can convince his electorate that immigrants ( only one-third of whom come from the poorer EU member states ) benefit the UK economy . 
The EU does not have a significant budget , and it sets at most a general framework for economic and social rules that vary widely across a large and diverse continent . 
Success and failure are largely determined at the national level . 
That is where the problems lie and where they must be solved . 
What has taken the form of an anti-EU vote constitutes in reality a protest against socio-economic problems at home .
