The Great Moderation 
It has been 20 years since Alan Greenspan became chairman of America &apos;s Federal Reserve Bank . 
The years since then have seen the fastest global average income growth rate of any generation , as well as remarkably few outbreaks of mass unemployment-causing deflation or wealth-destroying inflation . 
Only Japan &apos;s lost decade-and-a-half and the hardships of the transition from communism count as true macroeconomic catastrophes of a magnitude that was depressingly common in earlier decades . 
This &quot; great moderation &quot; was not anticipated when Alan Greenspan took office . 
America &apos;s fiscal policy was then thoroughly deranged - much more so than it is now . 
India appeared mired in stagnation . 
China was growing , but median living standards were not clearly in excess of those of China &apos;s so-called &quot; golden years &quot; of the early 1950 &quot; s , after land redistribution and before forced collectivization turned the peasantry into serfs . 
European unemployment had just taken another large upward leap , and the &quot; socialist &quot; countries were so incompatible with rational economic development that their political systems would collapse within two years . 
Latin America was stuck in its own lost decade after the debt crisis at the start of the 1980 &quot; s . 
Of course , the years since 1987 have not been without big macroeconomic shocks . 
America &apos;s stock market plummeted for technical reasons in the fall of that year . 
Saddam Hussein &apos;s invasion of Kuwait in 1991 shocked the world oil market . 
Europe &apos;s fixed exchange rate mechanism collapsed in 1992 . 
The rest of the decade was punctuated by the Mexican peso crisis of 1994 , the East Asian crisis of 1997-98 , and troubles in Brazil , Argentina , Turkey , and elsewhere , and the new millennium began with the collapse of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the economic fallout from the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . 
Moreover , today &apos;s global imbalances and misaligned real exchange rates threaten to bring on not just mild recession , but significant and prolonged depression . 
Yet , so far , none of these events - aside from Japan starting in the early 1990 &quot; s and the failures of transition in the lands east of Poland - has caused a prolonged crisis . 
Economists have proposed three explanations for why macroeconomic catastrophes have not caused more human suffering and deranged long-run economic growth over the past generation . 
First , some economists argue that we have simply been lucky , because there has been no structural change that has made the world economy more resilient . 
According to this view , we have simply rolled the dice and won five times in a row . 
We should be happy and grateful , but we should not expect it to continue . 
Second , central bankers have finally learned how to do their jobs . 
Before 1985 , according to this theory , central bankers switched their objectives from year to year . 
One year , they might seek to control inflation , but the previous year they sought to reduce unemployment , and next year they might try to lower the government &apos;s debt refinancing costs , and the year after that they might worry about keeping the exchange rate at whatever value their political masters prefer . 
The lack of far-sighted decision-making on the part of central bankers meant that economic policy lurched from stop to go to accelerate to slow down . 
When added to the normal shocks that afflict the world economy , this source of destabilizing volatility created the unstable world before 1987 that led many to wonder why somebody like Alan Greenspan - who had previously only spent a couple of years in government - would want the job . 
The final explanation is that financial markets have calmed down . 
Today , the smart money in financial markets takes a long-term view that asset prices are for the most part rational expectations of discounted future fundamental values . 
Before 1985 , by contrast , financial markets were overwhelmingly dominated by the herd behavior of short-term traders , people who sought not to identify fundamentals , but to predict what average opinion would expect average opinion to be , and to predict it before average opinion did . 
Thus , central bankers were stuck trying to control a world economy shocked by random changes in the animal spirits of investors and traders . 
When I examine these issues , I see no evidence in favor of the first theory . 
Our luck has not been good since 1985 . 
On the contrary , I think our luck - measured by the magnitude of the private sector and other shocks that have hit the global economy - has , in fact , been relatively bad . 
Nor do I see any evidence at all in favor of the third explanation . 
It would be nice if our financial markets were more rational than those of previous generations . 
But I don &apos;t see any institutional changes that have made them so . 
So my guess is that we would be well-advised to put our money on the theory that our central bankers today are more skilled , more far-sighted , and less prone to either short-sightedly jerking themselves around or being jerked around by political masters who unpredictably change the objectives they are supposed to pursue year after year . 
Long may this state of affairs continue .
