The Bank of England &apos;s Knockout Artist 
LONDON - In Canada , if you say you come from London , the natives often ask if you mean London , Ontario , or London , England . 
I always find the question somewhat irritating , perhaps revealing the persistence of an arrogant imperial mindset . 
But soon , perhaps , they will no longer need to ask : in London , we are all Canadians now . 
With what one commentator described as &quot; his rock star looks and PR charm , &quot; Mark Carney , the former governor of the Bank of Canada , has taken the city by storm in his first weeks as Governor of the Bank of England . 
Change is the order of the day at the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street . 
Out goes the fusty old inflation-targeting regime , with its fixation on the consumer price index and disregard for financial-sector imbalances . 
In comes a brave new world of &quot; state-contingent threshold-based forward guidance , &quot; complete with three conditional &quot; knockouts &quot; that would cause the guidance to be changed . 
We have had to learn a whole new lexicon of central-bank speak . 
These are heady times at the BoE ( in the heart of the financial district of Ontario-on-Thames ) . 
The simple point that Carney made in his first policy pronouncement was that interest rates will remain unchanged , and the BoE &apos;s variant of quantitative easing will remain in place , at least until unemployment falls below 7 % ( from its current rate of 7.8 % ) . 
Though it all sounded straightforward , markets were confused . 
The pound initially fell sharply , and then recovered , while long-term government borrowing rates have risen by around 30 basis points . 
This outcome may not have been what the new governor intended , but it is perhaps not surprising . 
Though forward guidance is a useful part of the modern central banker &apos;s tool kit , the Anglo-Canadian version on display in London is highly complex , mainly because it has been shoehorned into a policy framework designed for another purpose . 
There are four related problems . 
The first is that the United Kingdom retains policymaking by committee . 
To his credit , Carney has succeeded in persuading most of his new colleagues on the Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) to sign up to the new approach ( we now know there was one holdout ) . 
That could not be taken for granted . 
Their views have often been split in recent years . 
But individual voting remains in place , so Carney is not in sole charge of policymaking , as he was at the Bank of Canada . 
Any future commitments are conditional on keeping a majority of the committee in line . 
That leads to the second problem : the so-called knockouts - the other factors that can change the direction of policy - are clearly matters of judgment , not of fact . 
The first knockout would occur if , &quot; in the MPC &apos;s view , it is more likely than not that CPI inflation 18 to 24 months ahead will be 0.5 percentage points or more above the 2 % target . &quot; 
The second is that &quot; medium-term inflation expectations no longer remain sufficiently well anchored . &quot; 
There is plenty of scope for different judgments on both issues , neither of which lends itself to definitive answers based on solid numbers . 
And , sadly , when it comes to forecasting inflation , the BoE &apos;s record has not been very good . 
The final knockout - which would occur if &quot; the Financial Policy Committee ( FPC ) judges that the stance of monetary policy poses a significant threat to financial stability &quot; - points to the third problem . 
The FPC is part of the complex new UK regulatory structure , in which the former Financial Services Authority has been split in two : a prudential and business-conduct regulator and a new body to monitor financial stability . 
The new FPC must give its advice publicly to the MPC when it has concerns . 
The FPC , it should be emphasized , is chaired by the BoE &apos;s governor , so there is an element of smoke and mirrors here . 
But its composition is different from that of the MPC , so its view on a particular policy stance may be different as well , and here , too , the governor has only one vote . 
Some argue that it would have been simpler to merge the two , and the unwieldiness of the new means of articulating policy suggests that this might indeed have been a good idea . 
The BoE &apos;s governor is now in the odd position of being invited to knock himself out - and in public , too . 
That would be fun to watch . 
The fourth problem is the most fundamental . 
The government has chosen not to change the BoE &apos;s formal mandate . 
Its prime objective remains price stability , with real-economy factors relegated to the second order of importance . 
By contrast , the US Federal Reserve has a dual mandate : price stability and full employment . 
Of course it must continuously balance the two , but both have equal weight . 
It is the failure of the UK government to amend the statute that dictates the complex structure of knockouts that the BoE &apos;s ingenious staff has been obliged to devise . 
The unemployment threshold , linked to forward guidance , can be seen as a backdoor way of adding a second objective . 
But one would surely not start from there if that were the long-term policy aim . 
It would have been far clearer to address the issue head on and change the BoE &apos;s mandate . 
That would have painted the new regime with a veneer of democratic legitimacy , giving it greater authority . 
The government , however , decided not to open up the issue in parliament . 
The objectives of the new monetary-policy approach are admirable . 
The UK economy , while moving forward , is still operating well below capacity . 
But to keep all these balls in the air , and avoid knocking himself out , Carney will need all the creativity and agility of that other great Canadian export - Cirque du Soleil .
