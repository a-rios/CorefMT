The Import of Exports 
CAMBRIDGE - Should a country &apos;s development strategy pay special attention to exports ? 
After all , exports have nothing to do with satisfying their people &apos;s basic needs , such as education , health care , housing , power , water , telecoms , security , the rule of law , and recreation . 
So why give precedence to satisfying the needs of distant foreign consumers ? 
That , in a nutshell , is what many opponents of free trade and economic globalization - as well as many on the right who believe that all industries should be treated equally - want to know . 
But there are no right answers to wrong questions . 
It is precisely because governments care about their own people that they should focus on exports . 
To see this , consider what a market economy is all about . 
Some , including Pope Francis , would say that it is about greed - a system in which everybody cares only about herself . 
But a market economy should be understood as a system in which we are supposed to earn our keep by doing things for other people ; how much we earn depends on how others value what we do for them . 
The market economy forces us to be concerned about the needs of others , because it is their need that constitutes the source of our livelihood . 
In some sense , a market economy is a gift-exchange system ; money merely tracks the value of the gifts we give one another . 
As a result , a market economy encourages specialization : We become very good in a narrow set of skills or products , and exchange them for millions of other things we have no clue how to do or make . 
As a consequence , we end up doing remarkably few things and buying everything else from others . 
This observation is as true about an individual as it is about a place , whether the place is a neighborhood , a town , a state or province , or a country . 
Every town has grocery stores , beauty parlors , gas stations , and movie theaters that serve the local community . 
Economists call these &quot; non-tradable activities , &quot; because they are not undertaken with distant customers in mind . 
But the town &apos;s people would also want access to things that nobody in the city even knows how to make . 
For example , most towns and cities do not produce food , cars , gasoline , medicines , TVs , or films . 
So they need to &quot; import &quot; these goods from elsewhere . 
To pay for what they want from out-of-towners , they must sell them some of the things that they do know how to make . 
Of course , the out-of-towners have the option of buying from somewhere else . 
This is why the goods and services that a place can sell to non-residents have a disproportionate impact on its quality of life - and even its viability . 
A mining town becomes a ghost town when the mine closes , because the grocery store , the pharmacy , and the movie theater no longer have the capacity to buy the &quot; imported &quot; food , medicine , and films they need . 
In contrast to non-tradable activities , a place &apos;s export activities need to be pretty good to convince out-of-town customers - who have ample other options - to buy from local producers . 
That means that exports must have an attractive quality / cost ratio . 
One way to increase this ratio is to improve quality and productivity . 
Another is to lower wages . 
The higher the productivity and the quality of export activities , the higher the wages they can pay and still remain competitive . 
If employment in the export industry is significant , as is true in most places that do not rely on oil revenues , the wages that the export sector can afford will affect the wages of everybody in town . 
Everyone thus has an interest in improving their export sector . 
Because they are subject to greater competition , export activities tend to undergo faster technological and productivity improvements than other parts of the economy . 
They are constantly under threat from innovation and new competitors that could disrupt their business . 
Consider the iPhone &apos;s devastating impact on Finland &apos;s once-dominant national champion Nokia , or the effect of the shale-oil revolution on OPEC . 
Successful places tend to move from a few technologically simple industries that are competitive enough to export their products to a greater number of industries that are increasingly complex . 
For example , in 1963 , 97 % of Thailand &apos;s export basket was composed of agricultural and mineral products such as rice , rubber , tin , and jute . 
By 2013 , these represented less than 20 % of the total , while machinery and chemicals accounted for 56 % . 
A similar transformation can be seen in every successful non-OPEC developing country . 
The success of a place is very much related to its people &apos;s ability to accomplish this transformation , as exemplified by places such as Singapore , Turkey , and Israel . 
So what should countries , provinces , and cities do ? 
Skeptics might say that they should just focus on fixing the things that locals care about , such as education or infrastructure , or improve everybody &apos;s &quot; business environment . &quot; 
Exports will take care of themselves . 
But life is more complicated than this . 
The needs of export activities are often quite distinct . 
The specific rules , infrastructure , skills , and technological mastery that export activities require tend to be different from those needed for the non-tradable activities that usually generate the bulk of a place &apos;s employment . 
While diversification into new areas is always challenging , it is particularly difficult for tradable activities , which have to face foreign competition from the start . 
By contrast , pioneers in non-tradable activities start with a captive market . 
Moreover , exporters need particularly strong connections to knowhow found elsewhere on the planet , thus making them more sensitive to foreign investment , migration , and international professional links . 
To survive and thrive , societies need to pay special attention to those activities that produce goods and services they can sell to non-residents . 
Indeed , the need to act on new export opportunities and remove obstacles to success is probably the central lesson from the East Asian and Irish growth miracles . 
Non-tradable activities are akin to a country &apos;s sports leagues : different people like different teams . 
Those engaged in tradable activities are like the national team : we should all root for them - and organize ourselves to make sure they succeed .
