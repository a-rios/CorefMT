Peace Now 
Despite the fragile ceasefire in Lebanon , the risks of a widening war in the Middle East remain . 
Too many political leaders , including President George W. Bush , Prime Minister Tony Blair , and the leaders of radical groups in the Middle East , prefer military solutions to peaceful compromise . 
When Bush paints the Middle East as a struggle of good versus evil , or terror versus freedom , he abandons politics . 
When Israel attempts vainly to defeat Hezbollah , it tries to avoid painful but necessary political compromises over disputed territory . 
The problems of the Middle East are much more about politics and culture than about terror versus freedom . 
Part of the problem is Israel &apos;s continuing occupation of the West Bank as well as a piece of southern Lebanon . 
Until Israel agrees to return to the 1967 borders with minor modifications , and to end its political control over millions of West Bank Arabs , unrest will continue . 
Another part of the problem is the brazen manipulation of the Persian Gulf region by the UK and US to ensure their oil security . 
There can be little doubt that the current war in Iraq is fundamentally about oil . 
For nearly 100 years , first the British empire and then the US manipulated Middle Eastern governments , launched coups , bought puppet regimes , and supported wars , with the main purpose of controlling the region &apos;s oil flows . 
This approach continues despite its persistent failure . 
The key to oil security is peace , not military occupation and puppet regimes . 
The US embraced the Shah of Iran , and got the Iranian Revolution . 
The US embraced , and later toppled , Saddam Hussein , inciting chaos , with an unintended boost for Iran . 
The US stationed troops in Saudi Arabia and thus helped to create al-Qaeda &apos;s political agenda . 
The US pushed for elections in Palestine , but then championed the financial strangulation of the newly elected Hamas government . 
These factors , together with the obvious failings of many Middle Eastern governments , have fueled the surge of fundamentalism among Muslims , American Christians , and some Israeli Jews that has now boiled over to rampant extremism , terror , and messianic visions of good versus evil . 
True , fundamentalists are a minority everywhere , but they are stoking widespread fear , loathing , and dreams of salvation , provoking violence and war while weakening moderates forces . 
Many warmongers in Washington , including apparently some in the White House , are seeking to expand their endless military campaign to Iran and Syria . 
Indeed , the daily demonizing of Iran , Syria , and Hezbollah is the same as the morbid demonization of Saddam before the Iraq War . 
The war party appears to be trying to whip up American public opinion in support of a wider conflict . 
Political operatives may also judge that an increased sense of danger and insecurity will tilt votes to the Republicans in the US congressional elections in November . 
We need to reject &quot; us-versus-them &quot; logic , in which Israel is pure and the Arabs are evil ( or vice versa ) . 
Every state in the region must embrace compromise and mutual respect as the basis of a lasting settlement . 
Israel will not be able to avoid territorial withdrawals to the 1967 borders by exercising its military might ; the US will not be able to ensure oil security through continued military occupation in the Middle East ; and terrorists will not be able to destroy Israel or foist their fundamentalist ideas by force on moderate societies . 
This is no pipe dream . 
In my work throughout the world , as an economist and development practitioner , I find that the vast majority of individuals and political leaders of all religions , races , and creeds are ready to work together to achieve the shared goals of prosperity and wellbeing for their children . 
The claim by many Israelis that there are &quot; no partners for peace &quot; is absurd . 
Israel &apos;s neighbors will make peace on the basis of fair borders and fair play . 
Similarly , the claim that we are headed toward an inevitable clash of civilizations is sheer madness , propounded by people who think the worst of other groups but don &apos;t really know them through personal contact or shared experience . 
What unites us is vastly greater than what divides us . 
We can &apos;t depend on our political leaders to do what is needed , because many of them are captives or promoters of extremist views . 
Our independent media need to seek out voices not only of the warmongers who make so much noise , but also of civil society leaders whose voices we do not regularly hear . 
American newspapers need to publish op-ed pieces not only by Americans &quot; interpreting &quot; the Middle East , but also by representative thinkers from the Middle East itself . 
Scientists in Europe , the US , Asia , and the Middle East need to deepen their contacts and work together . 
The same is true with artists , musicians , sports teams , and community leaders . 
Crass tribalism now threatens to overwhelm all that unites us in our common care for our children , our planet , and our future . 
This is a challenge far too important to be left to Bush , Blair , Mahmoud Ahmedinejad , and Ehud Olmert . 
Peace will be won by the moderate voices around the world that demand an end to senseless violence and to the tragic illusions of those who believe in a &quot; final victory &quot; over their foes .
