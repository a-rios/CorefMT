Cloning \ u0027s Slippery Slope 
Sometime in the next two years a human being will likely be cloned . 
This may or may not bring shudders of horror , but will certainly not occur outside the law or in some shadowy offshore location . 
The medical , scientific , legal and political establishment will fully support the effort . 
This clone , however , will never leave the British laboratory in which it was created . 
Last January , a form of human cloning called &quot; therapeutic cloning &quot; - or more properly &quot; cell nuclear replacement &quot; - was legalized in Britain . 
As with in vitro fertilization , the British appear to have been the first to devise a regulatory scheme for morally contentious technology . 
The world is watching what will happen next . 
It is rather like a Woody Allen script , but run backwards . 
In Allen &apos;s 1973 film Sleeper , attempts are made to clone Hitler from his preserved nose . 
Today , instead of cloning people from spare parts - or spare cells , as is the case with reproductive cloning - scientists hope to grow those parts by cloning people . 
The first part of this procedure is similar to that used to create Dolly the sheep , the first cloned mammal . 
The nucleus from a human cell is inserted into an egg that had its nucleus removed . 
An embryo forms , but it will not be implanted in a uterus . 
Instead , embryonic stem cells will be derived from its inner cell mass . 
These cells have the potential to become every cell-type in the body , a potential which may lead to cures for many chronic diseases . 
Stem cells cannot become a baby . 
While Britain has legalized therapeutic cloning , they are poised to ban reproductive cloning . 
They oppose projects such as that of Drs. Severino Antinori of Rome and Panayiotis Zavos of Kentucky in America , who plan to enable infertile men to become fathers by inserting their DNA into an egg from their partner . 
Reproductive cloning raises several moral issues - principally those of safety . 
Scientists believe that human clones would have defects . 
Because the egg that receives the new nucleus has to reprogram it quickly - teaching it to give the instructions necessary to construct an entire human being - genes that should be &quot; turned on &quot; might well be &quot; turned off , &quot; and vice versa . 
This probably explains why at least some animal clones have problems with their hearts , lungs , and immune systems . 
Weight is a problem too . 
Dolly the sheep - although still going strong five years after her birth , and the mother of six ( all conceived the old-fashioned way ) - has always been plump . 
During a trip to the Roslin Institute where Dolly was cloned , I found her , shorn of her fleece and revealing an ample midsection , mournfully staring from behind a sign that said , &quot; hay only . &quot; 
The Duchess of York , Sarah Ferguson is not the only British celebrity on a diet . 
Being overweight is obvious . 
Other defects may be subtler and , perhaps , insignificant for farm animals . 
But where humans are concerned , safety must come first . 
Because the defects found in clones are not genetic mutations , pre-implantation diagnosis at the embryo stage will not reveal their existence . 
Problems caused by these defects could emerge at any point in the person &apos;s life . 
We would see a greater range of defects than we do in animals like mice because it is easier to analyze human behavior and physiology . 
Therapeutic cloning would probably be safer than reproductive cloning because any reprogramming defects would not affect every cell in the body - just the cells used in therapy . 
Thus far , only the UK has legalized therapeutic cloning . 
A law passed late last year in Japan permits it but forbids transferring the embryo to the uterus . 
In March , Denmark &apos;s Council of Ethics endorsed therapeutic cloning . 
Will any country that legalizes therapeutic cloning inevitably slide down the so-called slippery slope and end up tolerating reproductive cloning ? 
The idea behind a slippery slope is that if you do x , which is acceptable , you will end up doing y , which is not . 
Indeed , two types of slippery slopes - logical and sociological - exist . 
On the logical slippery slope , you slide to the bottom and embrace the morally unacceptable because there is no way to distinguish it from an acceptable practice . 
You can slide down the sociological slippery slope from one practice to the other - even if the two are conceptually different - just because the existence of one creates a social climate receptive to the other . 
Therapeutic cloning is conceptually distinct from reproductive cloning . 
Although the first step is the same , the intent behind the practices is not . 
The former would be done in order to save lives by treating diseases now incurable - say , Parkinson &apos;s , ALS , and multiple sclerosis . 
The latter - creating a person by cloning - would be done for reasons extending from egomania , to confusion between replication and resurrection , to the understandable desire to have a biologically related child . 
Will therapeutic cloning make it more likely that people come to accept reproductive cloning ? 
I don &apos;t think so . 
Therapeutic cloning is intended to heal the sick . 
The cells created through cloning would be an extension of the patient : a means to treat him with cells generated by his own body . 
It &apos;s almost like donating a pint of blood for yourself in case you need it for subsequent surgery . 
Even though I do not believe in a slippery slope from therapeutic to reproductive cloning , a society &apos;s laws should give voice to its values . 
In countries which allow for the former , it is probably a good idea to ban the latter .
