Europe \ u0027s Financial Vulnerability 
VIENNA - The most notable innovations of the past two decades have been financial . 
Like technological innovation , financial innovation is concerned with the perpetual search for greater efficiency - in this case , reducing the cost of transferring funds from savers to investors . 
Cost reductions that represent a net benefit to society should be regarded favorably . 
But as the current financial crisis demonstrates , where financial innovation is designed to circumvent regulation or taxation , we need to be more circumspect . 
Sadly , the financial revolution has been mostly rent-seeking rather than welfare-enhancing in character . 
It has been based on eliminating , or at least reducing , two key elements of banking costs closely associated with prudential arrangements . 
One is the need for banks and other financial institutions to hold liquid reserves . 
The less liquid a bank &apos;s assets , the greater the need for such reserves . 
But the yield on such reserves is small , so economizing on them is profitable . 
Last year &apos;s Northern Rock debacle in the United Kingdom will long remain an example of how not to manage such risk . 
Moreover , increasing a bank &apos;s leverage can be very profitable when returns on investments exceed the cost of funding . 
Reckless balance-sheet expansion in pursuit of profit is kept in check if financial companies adhere to statutory capital requirements , which mandate a capital-asset ratio of about 8 % . 
But many have sought to ignore this restriction , to their cost : the Carlyle Capital Corporation , a subsidiary of the United States-based Carlyle Group , was leveraged up to 32 times - it held one dollar of capital for every 32 dollars of assets - before adverse market developments wiped out the company . 
Avoidance of prudential requirements is at the core of today &apos;s financial crisis , exacerbated by the collapse of confidence in a system based on trust . 
This has exposed the fragility of the banking system , including quasi-banking institutions , as revealed by Bears Sterns , Lehman Brothers , and other US investment banks , and in Europe by Northern Rock , UBS , WestLB , and many more . 
Perhaps the most tragic aspect of this story is the exploitation of low-income families involved in the so-called sub-prime mortgage crisis , whereby variable-rate mortgages were offered to customers with a low credit rating . 
In fact , &quot; variable rate &quot; is a misnomer , since these mortgages &quot; artificially low initial interest rates were pre-programmed to include a big rate hike after a couple of years . 
Thereafter , rates would rise with market rates , but never fall when market rates declined . 
This structure could only have been devised to suck in as many customers as possible with scant regard for long-term consequences . 
With the property market booming , prospective capital gains promised untold wealth . 
And most mortgage holders probably expected to refinance their mortgages before their rising interest-rate trebled or quadrupled monthly repayments . 
Another hoped-for benefit was that capital gains could be converted into home equity loans , boosting homeowners &quot; living standards . 
The rude awakening came when property values began to decline . 
For those without an equity cushion , refinancing was not a possibility , and rising interest rates have led to default , foreclosure , and homelessness . 
Now we hear that sub-prime mortgage holders have only themselves to blame . 
No one talks of the bank manager , under pressure to sell &quot; financial products &quot; and eager to sign up customers , even if the products were not in a customer &apos;s best interest . 
The banker did not question a bonus system that favors one year of super profits , followed by bankruptcy , over two years of moderate , but stable , results . 
It is astonishing that sub-prime mortgages and their like were repackaged and resold in securitized form . 
That these collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs , or bonds backed by a pool of mortgages ) found a ready market , both in the US and abroad , reflects failure on several fronts . 
The nature of these CMOs should have been apparent to risk managers . 
Any financially literate fund manager knows that risk and return are positively correlated . 
Any fund manager who claims to have been deluded by the apparently favorable risk-yield characteristics of CMOs or related credit instruments can be accused of having fallen for Milton Friedman &apos;s &quot; free lunch . &quot; 
Risk models do not justify abandoning one &apos;s natural sense of incredulity . 
In a world where capital is free to flow across international boundaries , the crisis in the US has spread to Europe . 
This is a new form of contagion , which transcends national boundaries and is amplified by an international crisis of confidence . 
This is why the global problem today is many times greater than the Savings 
Loan crisis of the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , which cost American taxpayers an estimated $ 150 billion to clean up . 
Today , the global integration of financial markets means that problems can pop up anywhere , at any time . 
Central banks are currently attempting to plug one leak as the next appears . 
But if the financial system &apos;s dykes collapse , we may be headed for a decade of severe deflation , rendering expansionary stimulus useless . 
When the US Federal Reserve was created in 1913 , its most important function was to serve as a lender of last resort to troubled banks , providing emergency liquidity via the discount facility . 
The current crisis suggests that this is no longer enough . 
Central banks worldwide are being forced to act as market makers of last resort in securities markets . 
The signs are already visible . 
The European Central Bank has also failed to tackle local bubbles in Europe . 
The justification was that the ECB is concerned with inflation , not relative price adjustments . 
This means that monetary policy is geared towards the needs of large countries , like Germany , not to those of , say , Belgium . 
But , given the scale of the threat to Europe &apos;s economy from a full-blown financial crisis , this apologia for inactivity has outlived its usefulness .
