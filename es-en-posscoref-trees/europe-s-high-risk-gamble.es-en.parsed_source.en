Europe &apos;s High-Risk Gamble 
CAMBRIDGE - The Greek government needs to escape from an otherwise impossible situation . 
It has an unmanageable level of government debt ( 150 % of GDP , rising this year by ten percentage points ) , a collapsing economy ( with GDP down by more than 7 % this year , pushing the unemployment rate up to 16 % ) , a chronic balance-of-payments deficit ( now at 8 % of GDP ) , and insolvent banks that are rapidly losing deposits . 
The only way out is for Greece to default on its sovereign debt . 
When it does , it must write down the principal value of that debt by at least 50 % . 
The current plan to reduce the present value of privately held bonds by 20 % is just a first small step toward this outcome . 
If Greece leaves the euro after it defaults , it can devalue its new currency , thereby stimulating demand and shifting eventually to a trade surplus . 
Such a strategy of &quot; default and devalue &quot; has been standard fare for countries in other parts of the world when they were faced with unmanageably large government debt and a chronic current-account deficit . 
It hasn &apos;t happened in Greece only because Greece is trapped in the single currency . 
The markets are fully aware that Greece , being insolvent , will eventually default . 
That &apos;s why the interest rate on Greek three-year government debt recently soared past 100 % and the yield on ten-year bonds is 22 % , implying that a € 100 principal payable in ten years is worth less than € 14 today . 
Why , then , are political leaders in France and Germany trying so hard to prevent - or , more accurately , to postpone - the inevitable ? 
There are two reasons . 
First , the banks and other financial institutions in Germany and France have large exposures to Greek government debt , both directly and through the credit that they have extended to Greek and other eurozone banks . 
Postponing a default gives the French and German financial institutions time to build up their capital , reduce their exposure to Greek banks by not renewing credit when loans come due , and sell Greek bonds to the European Central Bank . 
The second , and more important , reason for the Franco-German struggle to postpone a Greek default is the risk that a Greek default would induce sovereign defaults in other countries and runs on other banking systems , particularly in Spain and Italy . 
This risk was highlighted by the recent downgrade of Italy &apos;s credit rating by Standard 
Poor &apos;s . 
A default by either of those large countries would have disastrous implications for the banks and other financial institutions in France and Germany . 
The European Financial Stability Fund is large enough to cover Greece &apos;s financing needs but not large enough to finance Italy and Spain if they lose access to private markets . 
So European politicians hope that by showing that even Greece can avoid default , private markets will gain enough confidence in the viability of Italy and Spain to continue lending to their governments at reasonable rates and financing their banks . 
If Greece is allowed to default in the coming weeks , financial markets will indeed regard defaults by Spain and Italy as much more likely . 
That could cause their interest rates to spike upward and their national debts to rise rapidly , thus making them effectively insolvent . 
By postponing a Greek default for two years , Europe &apos;s politicians hope to give Spain and Italy time to prove that they are financially viable . 
Two years could allow markets to see whether Spain &apos;s banks can handle the decline of local real-estate prices , or whether mortgage defaults will lead to widespread bank failures , requiring the Spanish government to finance large deposit guarantees . 
The next two years would also disclose the financial conditions of Spain &apos;s regional governments , which have incurred debts that are ultimately guaranteed by the central government . 
Likewise , two years could provide time for Italy to demonstrate whether it can achieve a balanced budget . 
The Berlusconi government recently passed a budget bill designed to raise tax revenue and to bring the economy to a balanced budget by 2013 . 
That will be hard to achieve , because fiscal tightening will reduce Italian GDP , which is now barely growing , in turn shrinking tax revenue . 
So , in two years , we can expect a debate about whether budget balance has then been achieved on a cyclically adjusted basis . 
Those two years would also indicate whether Italian banks are in better shape than many now fear . 
If Spain and Italy do look sound enough at the end of two years , European political leaders can allow Greece to default without fear of dangerous contagion . 
Portugal might follow Greece in a sovereign default and in leaving the eurozone . 
But the larger countries would be able to fund themselves at reasonable interest rates , and the current eurozone system could continue . 
If , however , Spain or Italy does not persuade markets over the next two years that they are financially sound , interest rates for their governments and banks will rise sharply , and it will be clear that they are insolvent . 
At that point , they will default . 
They would also be at least temporarily unable to borrow and would be strongly tempted to leave the single currency . 
But there is a greater and more immediate danger : Even if Spain and Italy are fundamentally sound , there may not be two years to find out . 
The level of Greek interest rates shows that markets believe that Greece will default very soon . 
And even before that default occurs , interest rates on Spanish or Italian debt could rise sharply , putting these countries on a financially impossible path . 
The eurozone &apos;s politicians may learn the hard way that trying to fool markets is a dangerous strategy .
