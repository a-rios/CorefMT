Immigration and the New Class Divide 
SINGAPORE - The British shadow minister for Europe , Pat McFadden , recently warned members of his Labour Party that they should try to make the most of the global economy and not treat immigration like a disease . 
As he put it , &quot; You can feed on people &apos;s grievances or you can give people a chance . 
And I think our policies should be around giving people a chance . &quot; 
In a world increasingly dominated by grievances - against immigrants , bankers , Muslims , &quot; liberal elites , &quot; &quot; Eurocrats , &quot; cosmopolitans , or anything else that seems vaguely alien - such wise words are rare . 
Leaders worldwide should take note . 
In the United States , Republicans - backed by their Tea Party activists - are threatening to close the government down just because President Barack Obama has offered undocumented immigrants who have lived and worked in the US for many years a chance to gain citizenship . 
The United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) wants to introduce a five-year ban on immigration for permanent settlement . 
Russia &apos;s deputy prime minister , Dmitry Rogozin , once released a video promising to &quot; clean the rubbish &quot; - meaning migrant workers , mostly from former Soviet republics - &quot; away from Moscow . &quot; 
Even the once famously tolerant Dutch and Danes are increasingly voting for parties that fulminate against the scourge of immigration . 
Always keen to assert the freedom to insult Muslims , the Dutch Freedom Party wants to ban all mosques . 
And the tiny and much-harassed opposition parties in Singapore - a country where almost everyone is descended from immigrants - are gaining traction by appealing to popular gripes about immigrants ( mostly from India and China ) who are supposedly taking jobs from &quot; natives . &quot; 
What can American Tea Party enthusiasts , Russian chauvinists , fearful Dutch and Danes , and Singaporean leftists possibly have in common that is driving this anti-immigrant sentiment ? 
Retaining one &apos;s job in a tightening economy is undoubtedly a serious concern . 
But the livelihoods of most of the middle-aged rural white Americans who support the Tea Party are hardly threatened by poor Mexican migrants . 
UKIP is popular in some parts of England where immigrants are rarely seen . 
And many of the Dutch Freedom Party &apos;s voters live nowhere near a mosque . 
Anti-immigrant sentiment cuts across the old left-right divide . 
One thing Tea Party or UKIP supporters share with working-class voters who genuinely fear losing their jobs to low-paid foreigners is anxiety about being left behind in a world of easy mobility , supranational organizations , and global networking . 
On the right , support for conservative parties is split between business interests that benefit from immigration or supranational institutions , and groups that feel threatened by them . 
That is why the British Tories are so afraid of UKIP . 
Nigel Farage , UKIP &apos;s leader , is less concerned with economic growth than with pursuing his extreme conception of national independence . 
On the left , opinion is split between those who oppose racism and intolerance above all and those who want to protect employment and preserve &quot; solidarity &quot; for what is left of the native-born working class . 
It would be a mistake to dismiss anxiety about immigration as mere bigotry or apprehension about the globalized economy as simply reactionary . 
National , religious , and cultural identities ( for lack of a better word ) are being transformed , though less by immigration than by the development of globalized capitalism . 
In the new global economy , there are clear winners and losers . 
Educated men and women who can communicate effectively in varied international contexts are benefiting . 
People who lack the needed education or experience - and there are many of them - are struggling . 
In other words , the new class divisions run less between the rich and the poor than between educated metropolitan elites and less sophisticated , less flexible , and , in every sense , less connected provincials . 
It is irrelevant that the provincials &quot; political leaders ( and their backers ) are sometimes wealthier than the resented metropolitan elites . 
They still feel looked down upon . 
And so they share the bitterness of those who feel alienated in a world they find bewildering and hateful . 
Populist rabble-rousers like to stir up such resentments by ranting about foreigners who work for a pittance or not at all . 
But it is the relative success of ethnic minorities and immigrants that is more upsetting to indigenous populations . 
This explains the popular hostility toward Obama . 
Americans know that , before too long , whites will be just another minority , and people of color will increasingly be in positions of power . 
At this point , all Tea Partiers and others like them can do is declare , &quot; We want our country back ! &quot; 
Of course , this is an impossible demand . 
Short of unleashing massive and bloody ethnic cleansing - Bosnia , on a continental scale - Americans and others have no choice but to get used to living in increasingly diverse societies . 
Likewise , economic globalization cannot be undone . 
But regulation can and should be improved . 
After all , some things are still worth protecting . 
There are good reasons not to leave culture , education , lifestyles , or jobs completely exposed to the creative destruction of market forces . 
McFadden has pinpointed the central solution to globalization &apos;s challenges : giving people &quot; the tools to reap the benefits &quot; of the globalized world , thereby making the &quot; connected world work better for people . &quot; 
The problem is that this call is more likely to appeal to the highly educated , already privileged classes than to those who feel disenfranchised in today &apos;s global economy . 
This is a serious problem for political parties on the left , which increasingly seem to be speaking for the metropolitan elites , while provincial populists are pushing traditional conservatives further to the right by fishing in the dark waters of popular resentment .
