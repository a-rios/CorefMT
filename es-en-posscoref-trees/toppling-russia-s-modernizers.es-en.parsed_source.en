Toppling Russia &apos;s Modernizers 
MOSCOW - Russian President Dmitri Medvedev &apos;s decision to fire Moscow &apos;s long entrenched mayor , Yuri Luzhkov , is the most decisive move he has made in his presidency . 
Is it really part of his drive to modernize Russia , or part of an emerging power play with Moscow &apos;s real strong man , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ? 
Anatoly Chubais , the father of Russian privatization in the 1990 &quot; s and the current head of the country &apos;s nano-technology conglomerate RosNano , recently admitted that the prospects for political modernization in Russia are dim . 
&quot; Today , &quot; he said , &quot; no demand for it exists . 
Such demand requires a social group to promote it . &quot; 
He went even further in a conversation with foreign investors , suggesting that the threat of fascism in Russia will grow to the point that &quot; discussions about Putin and Medvedev , Medvedev or Putin , will pale in comparison . &quot; 
This gloomy view might be explained by the interest Chubais has in stopping the West from challenging Russia &apos;s rulers for violating human rights and curtailing freedom . 
To avoid an even worse alternative , the United States and Europe should support the Putin-Medvedev tandem , in the hope that they provide a stable and secure environment for investment . 
Chubais , a one-time reformer , is now totally complicit in the regime &apos;s policies . 
Nevertheless , he is telling the truth . 
Russia &apos;s chief modernizer and protégé of President Dmitri Medvedev , Igor Yurgens of the Institute of Contemporary Development , thinks in much the same way . 
Indeed , he suggests that Russians &quot; are not citizens , but rather some sort of tribe , &quot; and that the archaic character of Russian society is not likely to change before 2050 . 
Of course , Russian politicians are always fond of assigning a due date for change : Nikita Khrushchev once memorably promised to build communism in 20 years . 
But what matters here is a common perception that Russians are not ready to assume the responsibilities of citizenship . 
Once again , all the formulas for Western-type democracy depend on the will of an enlightened and benevolent czar . 
Medvedev is currently seeking to perform this role . 
Once he brings about truly modernizing reforms , people will supposedly follow willingly , forgetting centuries of serfdom , the dictatorship of the proletariat , the political chaos and economic free-fall of the 1990 &quot; s , and the decade of Putin &apos;s managed democracy . 
But neither Khrushchev , nor Mikhail Gorbachev , nor Boris Yeltsin were able to uproot Russia &apos;s stubborn culture of indifference and subordination , precisely because they insisted on top-down change and expected that the Russian people would simply acquiesce en masse . 
Will Medvedev succeed where all others have failed ? 
The scandal over Mayor Luzhkov &apos;s incompetence in handling this summer &apos;s deadly heat wave and wild fires is being portrayed as a split between the &quot; modernizing &quot; Medvedev and the &quot; old guard &quot; Putin . 
The Kremlin recently ran on its TV channels documentaries savaging Luzhkov , and Medvedev has indicated that it &apos;s high time for the mayor to retire . 
Putin , on the other hand , has not been publically critical of Luzhkov . 
After all , it was under his ( unlikely disinterested ) supervision that the mayor turned Moscow into a private fiefdom . 
With a city budget of almost $ 50 billion , Luzhkov encouraged architectural vandalism , overlooked giant traffic jams , and saw his wife become the richest woman in Russia through her Moscow construction projects . 
To all of this , Putin never once said &quot; boo . &quot; 
Most analysts suggest that this visible disagreement between Putin and Medvedev over Luzhkov &apos;s fate is a sign of a looming contest for the presidency in 2012 . 
Luzhkov , after all , had been vocally critical of Medvedev , while praising Putin - allegedly an attempt to drive a wedge between the two . 
So , in this scenario , unmasking Luzhkov as corrupt and incompetent , and using him as a scapegoat for Russia &apos;s systemic inefficiency , is intended as a way for Medvedev to sway public opinion behind him and make Putin appear out of touch . 
The problem , though , is that Medvedev , like Luzhkov , was also mostly invisible during the summer &apos;s disastrous heat wave , whereas Putin was everywhere , even piloting fire-fighting airplanes over burning forests . 
Since Putin did not formally take sides over what would happen to Luzhkov , had Medvedev &apos;s campaign against Moscow &apos;s former mayor failed , the president would have found himself without a job in 2012 . 
He would be forced to join Russia &apos;s pathetic opposition , which bears part of the blame for the country &apos;s toxic political culture . 
The opposition - led by Boris Nemtsov , the former leader of the now-defunct Union of Right Forces , Mikhail Kasyanov , a former prime minister , chess master Garry Kasparov , and the writer Edward Limonov - has no coherent message with which to win support or provide a credible alternative to the country &apos;s current leadership . 
So the power elite fight among themselves , because there is no one else to fight with . 
Now with Medvedev showing what appears to be a backbone , the presidential election campaign is officially on the way . 
The truth is , Russian elections won &apos;t depend on who has been more displeased with Luzhkov . 
Russians who are dissatisfied with the system still have a limited choice : either support marginal , weak , and discredited oppositional candidates , or , hoping for modernization from the top , side with the very system they oppose . 
There is nothing new in the mistrust of the masses expressed by people like Chubais or Yurgens , or in Medvedev &apos;s putative desire to impose modernization from the top . 
( Khrushchev &apos;s &quot; Thaw &quot; and Gorbachev &apos;s Perestroika happened the same way . ) 
What is new , in Russia at least , is the emergence of organized resistance to this failed paradigm . 
Beyond the opposition , numerous non-political public initiatives have sprung up in the last several years to protest specific government policies - leading inevitably to confrontation with the existing political order . 
To be sure , such initiatives have not become substantial , and the political opposition is constantly trying to appropriate them to make their own case more credible . 
But it is these people - motorists , volunteer ecologists , and charitable-campaign organizers - rather than Russia &apos;s politicians who represent the country &apos;s best hope for modernization .
