Let &apos;s Get Real About Money 
Throughout the world , people suffer from a serious perception error that has inhibited them from taking concrete steps to protect themselves from inflation or deflation . 
The error is called the &quot; money illusion &quot; - the belief that a nominal unit of currency is the best measure of value , even though its real value is unstable . 
Historically , failure to protect against inflation or deflation has helped spur calamitous outcomes . 
When spectacular inflation hit Germany in 1923 , it wiped out the real value of the ( unhedged and unindexed ) life savings and social-security benefits of millions of people , whose anger contributed to the rise of Nazism . 
Similarly , spectacular deflation in many countries around the world in the early 1930 &quot; s magnified the real value of ( unhedged and unindexed ) debts , leading to millions of defaults and widespread bank failures . 
Deflation also magnified the real value of wages and salaries , thereby fueling layoffs and unemployment . 
Failure to hedge or index brought us the Great Depression . 
Much of Japan &apos;s economic malaise in recent years also reflects ( unhedged and unindexed ) debts magnified by deflation since 1999 . 
In 2003 , an IMF study raised the specter of Japan-like problems around the world , and listed thirteen countries , including , China , Germany , Singapore , and Poland , with a moderate to high risk of deflation . 
Yet , in the face of overwhelming evidence of the importance of inflation or deflation risk , most people - even in countries that have been warned - generally still have not taken steps to protect themselves . 
Given widespread apathy about changes in consumer prices , the modest success of a new market to hedge inflation risk , the European inflation futures market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) , is noteworthy . 
Since September , this new market has traded the Eurozone &apos;s Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices , or HICP - a contract that traders call the &quot; hiccup . &quot; 
By purchasing or selling it , companies and individuals can protect themselves against losses stemming from changes in the value of their currency . 
The open interest recently was 355 contracts , with a notional value of â‚¬ 355 million . 
This is a real beginning , and we should encourage such contracts to grow in order to help billions of people hedge their inflation and deflation risks . 
This failure can be explained only by the money illusion , which ultimately is connected with what psychologists call &quot; framing . &quot; 
How a concept is framed , the context and associations with which it is presented , affect human judgments enormously . 
A tax called a &quot; death tax &quot; is regarded very differently from a tax called an &quot; inheritance tax , &quot; even though the two are really identical . 
The money illusion occurs because we are accustomed to economic values almost always being framed in terms of money . 
For years , I have been arguing that national governments should take some simple steps to reframe economic quantities and help the public overcome the money illusion . 
They could merely create an indexed unit of account to replace currency for measuring economic quantities and defining prices . 
The unit would be nothing more than a consumer price index , given a simple name , and published daily , so that people could use this unit and its name to quote prices in real terms . 
It would be easy and virtually costless . 
Indexed units of account are not a new idea ; 
Despite the unit &apos;s technical-sounding name , people in Chile seem to have learned to think in terms of the UF instead of the peso for important contracts . 
Following Chile &apos;s example , governments also could redefine the tax system in terms of the units of account rather than currency . 
That way , people who fill out tax forms would have to learn the units of account . 
As a side benefit , the tax system would be automatically , fully , and transparently indexed to inflation . 
In my 2003 book The New Financial Order , I proposed that such units be called &quot; baskets , &quot; since a consumer price index is the price of a representative market basket of goods and services . 
That name is very simple , and it conveys a new conceptual framing : by promising to pay someone so many baskets at a future date , one is promising to pay in market baskets of goods and services . 
Of course , the actual payment will be made in ordinary currency at the contemporaneous exchange rate , based on the consumer price index , between baskets and the currency . 
What if people really got used to expressing quantities in baskets ? 
Wouldn &apos;t futures contracts sound completely different if they were reframed as contracts for &quot; baskets &quot; instead of &quot; hiccups ? &quot; 
A futures market for the complete market basket that consumers buy certainly rings with importance . 
Ultimately , the advance of information technology will be the salvation of ideas like the CME &apos;s inflation futures market and indexed units of account . 
Inflation futures appear to be gaining hold in part because the new contract is traded on an efficient electronic market ( the Globex system ) that allows futures contracts to get going without the initial splash that is required by open-outcry pit-based futures markets . 
Indeed , this is also why an American exchange can make a market for European inflation ; with new information technology , it no longer matters where people live . 
The sooner this happens , the sooner one more scourge of financial instability will be behind us .
