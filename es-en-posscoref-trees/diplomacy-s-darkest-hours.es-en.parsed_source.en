Diplomacy &apos;s Darkest Hours 
MADRID - Diplomacy is not having its finest hour nowadays . 
Quite the contrary : resistance to diplomatic solutions is a common thread in most of today &apos;s major conflicts . 
Afghanistan will continue to bleed until the allies finally recognize that only by engaging the Taliban do they stand a chance of ending the war . 
But the West will also have to recognize that conflicts with a potent cultural and religious component are simply not susceptible to a military solution - a realization that points toward ending the ostracism of political Islam - Hamas and Hezbollah , for example . 
Meanwhile , Iran &apos;s unstoppable rush to develop nuclear weapons could prove to be a monument to the international community &apos;s failure to stem the atomic tide in the region . 
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to be the diplomatic charade that it has been for many years now . 
And nothing has attenuated the tensions between Israel and both Syria and Lebanon . 
History teaches that diplomacy all too frequently produces results only when backed by overwhelming power . 
Such was the existentialist worldview of US President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Theodore Roosevelt , a major advocate of American expansionism : &quot; A just war is , in the long run , far better for a man &apos;s soul than the most prosperous peace . &quot; 
A century later , another American president , Barack Obama , immersed in two hopeless wars in the Middle East , received his Nobel Peace Prize with an apology for &quot; just wars . &quot; 
Indeed , the list of Nobel Peace Prize laureates is not lacking in men - Roosevelt , George Marshall , Menachem Begin , Anwar Sadat , Yitzhak Rabin , Yasser Arafat , and Henry Kissinger - who either ended up recognizing the limits of military power or were simply following Clausewitz &apos;s dictum that war is the continuation of politics by other means . 
Conflicts start to be ripe for diplomatic solutions only when the parties get trapped in an unbearably painful mutual deadlock . 
Without such a deadlock , neither United Nations resolutions , nor premature peace initiatives can cut short the dynamic of war . 
It is only then that formulas for power-sharing - such as those in Northern Ireland , Lebanon , Guatemala , or Iraq - emerge as a realistic alternative . 
It was NATO &apos;s robust military intervention , not European diplomacy , that created the conditions for the end of genocide and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia . 
Martti Ahtisaari fully deserved his Nobel Peace Prize for articulating a diplomatic solution to Kosovo &apos;s drive for independence . 
However encouraging , Czechoslovakia &apos;s peaceful &quot; velvet divorce &quot; into two states has not been the norm in Europe or elsewhere . 
If it were not for the 1973 Yom Kippur War , Israel and Egypt would never have reached a peace settlement . 
And it was the first Gulf War and Palestinian Intifadah that created the conditions for the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference and the subsequent Oslo Accords . 
After Rabin &apos;s assassination , the notion has been gaining ground that any Israeli-Palestinian accord would be the &quot; peace of the exhausted , &quot; not Rabin &apos;s &quot; peace of the brave . &quot; 
But the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is nonetheless sui generis : either the parties &quot; six-decade mutual deadlock is not unbearable enough , or they prefer to pay the price of conflict rather than compromise their national ethos . 
Such is now the loss of hope in a negotiated solution that those who advocate an internationally imposed solution seem to be gaining ground . 
Internal conflicts that end not with mutual deadlock but with an overwhelming victory by one of the parties hardly ever produce diplomatic solutions . 
Long years of mediation and endless peace proposals in the Sri Lanka conflict failed to end the war and the devastation of entire Tamil communities . 
&quot; Peace &quot; came about only with the total and unconditional defeat of the Tamil Tiger rebels . 
Likewise , the failure of Chechnya , Biafra , Tibet , or the Kurdish areas of the Middle East to reach independent statehood is attributable entirely to their military impotence . 
By contrast , Eritrea , East Timor , and parts of the former Yugoslavia achieved independence by exhausting their occupiers and / or their internal rivals . 
There are few cases where diplomacy actually succeeded in preventing war . 
Almost invariably , the greatest diplomatic successes have followed , rather than preceded , bloodshed . 
In 1919 , John Maynard Keynes told the statesmen of post-World War I Europe to abandon their vindictive patriotism for the sake of building a future of peace based on European integration . 
Alas , it took another world war to convince European leaders of the validity of Keynes &apos;s approach . 
The European Union - an empire built through diplomacy and consensus - emerged out of the ashes . 
One should , however , resist falling back on fatalism . 
Colombia &apos;s new president , Juan Manuel Santos , showed genuine courage in cutting short a march to war with Venezuela and calming down the entire Bolivarian axis ( Venezuela , Ecuador , and Bolivia ) by reviving the region &apos;s diplomatic channels . 
His was a truly revolutionary shift from the politics of saber-rattling to the hard work of establishing regional peace . 
To be sure , much hope still lies in popular diplomacy , in civil society mobilizing for peace . 
Frequently , governments need to be coaxed into accepting the inevitability of compromise , thanks to pressure from below . 
Civil society &apos;s support for bridging the psychological gap between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland helped pave the way to peace . 
And Israel &apos;s withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000 , after 18 years of useless military occupation , largely reflected the immense impact of the &quot; Four Mothers &quot; Movement &quot; on Israel &apos;s government . 
But popular diplomacy alone never forces political leaders to end wars and make peace . 
Official diplomacy begins where the battlefield ends . 
Unfortunately , in today &apos;s most consequential militarized conflicts , that boundary is still nowhere in sight .
