The Emerging &quot; New Middle East &quot; 
President George W. Bush &apos;s Middle East policy undeniably managed to achieve one thing : it has thoroughly destabilized the region . 
Otherwise , the results are not at all what the United States had hoped to accomplish . 
A democratic , pro-Western Middle East is not in the cards . 
But , while things are not developing as American neo-conservatives had intended , they are nevertheless developing . 
The historical failure named Iraq war , the demise of secular Arab nationalism and the soaring oil and gas prices have wrought profound changes in the region . 
From Damascus to Dubai , from Tel Aviv to Teheran , a new Middle East is now emerging . 
The old Middle East arose from the borders and political identities created by the European powers after the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 . 
Its driving ideological force was a European-inspired secular nationalism , which strove for political and social modernization through top-down government action . 
This type of nationalism , or &quot; Arab socialism , &quot; reached its apex during the Cold War , when it could lean on Soviet military , political , and economic support . 
Its end came with that of the Soviet Union , as it petrified into authoritarian , corrupt , and inefficient military regimes and dictatorships . 
The end of the Soviet Union also triggered a profound military crisis in many Arab states : without Soviet support as an external guarantor of their military capabilities , the nationalist regimes were no longer able to keep pace with military modernization . 
The nationalist regimes thus gradually lost domestic popular legitimacy , creating a vacuum that non-state actors have now largely filled . 
The ideological forces and the currency of power have also changed , with political Islam replacing secularism while skillfully integrating social issues and revolutionary , anti-Western nationalism . 
Today , the old Middle East can still be found in Syria , Egypt , Yemen , Tunisia , Algeria , and Fatah-controlled Palestine . 
The new Middle East includes Dubai , the Gulf emirates , and Israel , as well as Hezbollah , Hamas , and jihadi terrorism - and , partly , Iran and Saudi Arabia . 
Jordan and Morocco are also trying to associate themselves with the new Middle East . 
Obviously , as these examples suggest , &quot; new &quot; does not necessarily mean better , but simply different and more modern . 
Indeed , modernization by no means implies a solution to the conflicts that continue to fester in the region . 
Instead , these conflicts are themselves &quot; modernized , &quot; which could make them even more dangerous than in the past . 
An aspect of such modernization could be seen in the 2006 Lebanon war between Israel and Hezbollah , where tank warfare was rendered obsolete by missiles and Katyushas . 
At the same time , non-state actors , such as Hezbollah , Hamas , and al-Qaeda , have taken the place of traditional armies , and suicide bombers equipped with road-side and car bombs or explosive belts have replaced guerrilla fighters with their Kalashnikovs . 
Perhaps the most important change is the shift in the region &apos;s political and military center of gravity . 
While Israel , Palestine , and Lebanon defined the most important hot spots in the old Middle East , regional power and politics in the wake of the Iraq war is now centered in the Persian Gulf . 
The dominant conflict is no longer the Israeli-Palestinian struggle , but the threat of a confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia for sub-regional supremacy , and between Iran and the US for regional hegemony . 
Indeed , it is by now virtually impossible to implement any solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without Iran and its local allies - Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine . 
In a way , then , the war in Iraq forms the strategic and military bridge between the old and the new Middle East . 
The US intervention has brought about four far-reaching changes in the region : 
路 Iran &apos;s hegemonic ambitions have been unleashed , and the country has been helped to a strategic position that it could never have reached on its own . 
路 The democratization of Iraq has empowered the Shi &apos;a majority , which in turn greatly strengthened Iran &apos;s influence . 
Indeed , the war in Iraq has transformed the centuries-old Shi &apos;a-Sunni conflict by infusing it with modern geopolitical significance and extending it to the entire region . 
路 The rise of Iran poses an existential threat to Saudi Arabia , because the country &apos;s oil-rich northeast is populated by a Shi &apos;a majority . 
A Shi &apos;a government in Baghdad , dominated by Iran , would , in the medium term , threaten Saudi Arabia &apos;s territorial integrity - a scenario that the Saudis cannot , and will not , accept . 
路 Should Iran manage to become a nuclear power , the Saudis &quot; existential fears would dramatically escalate . 
More generally , the currency of conventional military power in the Middle East would largely lose its value , inevitably resulting in a regional nuclear arms race . 
Emanating from this new situation is the threat of disintegration of the whole Anglo-French system of states in the Middle East . 
The first candidate is , of course , Iraq . 
Whether Iraq can be held together despite the ethnic and religious confrontations that pit Kurds against Arabs and Sunnis against the Shi &apos;a is one of the most pregnant questions for the new Middle East . 
For Iraq &apos;s disintegration would be hard to contain ; indeed , it could bring about a thorough balkanization of the region . 
Another important question is whether political Islam will move toward democracy and acceptance of modernity or remain trapped in radicalism and invocation of the past ? 
The forefront of this battle is , at the moment , not in the Middle East , but in Turkey ; nevertheless , the result is bound to have more general significance . 
The emergence of the new Middle East may present an opportunity to establish a regional order that reflects the legitimate interests of all the actors involved , provides secure borders , and replaces hegemonic aspirations with transparency and cooperation . 
If not , or if such an opportunity is not seized , the new Middle East will be much more dangerous than the old one .
