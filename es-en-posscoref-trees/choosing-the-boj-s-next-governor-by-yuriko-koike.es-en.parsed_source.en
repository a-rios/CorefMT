The Pope of Japanese Finance 
TOKYO - While the world focuses on the gathering of cardinals in Rome to choose a successor to Pope Benedict XVI , a similar conclave is underway in Tokyo to choose the Bank of Japan &apos;s ( BOJ ) next governor . 
And , as with the deliberations at the Vatican , politics , not doctrinal debate , is underpinning the decision-making process in Japan . 
Last December , the president of the Liberal Democratic Party , Shinzo Abe , won back control of the government for the LDP after more than three years in opposition , securing the post of Prime Minister for the second time . 
In his election campaign , and since coming to power , Abe has advocated a radical revitalization of the Japanese economy that would end two decades of deflation and growing political and strategic uncertainty . 
In anticipation of an LDP-led government ( with the New Komeito Party as a junior coalition partner ) , financial markets began to move toward a weaker yen . 
Japan &apos;s stock market reacted favorably as well , rising almost 30 % since the vote . 
Abe &apos;s three main economic policies , dubbed &quot; Abenomics &quot; by the global press , are known at home as the &quot; three arrows &quot; approach - a reference to the sixteenth-century daimyo ( feudal lord ) Mori Motonari , who had three sons . 
One day , Motonari asked each of them to snap an arrow , which they did without difficulty . 
But when he then asked them to snap three arrows , none could do it . 
Having demonstrated that what is fragile on its own can be robust in a bundle , Motonari urged his sons to remain united . 
The three arrows in Abenomics are fiscal spending , deregulation of cosseted sectors of the Japanese economy , and monetary easing . 
The supplementary fiscal spending will span a total of 15 months , focusing on speedy completion of public works required for recovery after the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 . 
The growth strategy will include targeting industries like regenerative medicine , with greater spending , for example , on cell research conducted by Nobel laureate Shinya Yamanaka ; it will also feature policies aimed at leveraging the power of women , who are underrepresented in the work force , particularly when compared to other modern economies . 
The problem , from the start , was the third arrow . 
The BOJ &apos;s current governor , Masaaki Shirakawa , holds very different views on fiscal and monetary policy from those on which Abe campaigned . 
Indeed , it was Shirakawa who , as BOJ Executive Director , decided in March 2006 to end - quite prematurely - the quantitative easing that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi &apos;s government had implemented at the beginning of 2004 . 
When a new BOJ governor was chosen in 2008 , Shirakawa was initially seen as a dark-horse candidate . 
But the nominees presented by the LDP government of Prime Minister Taro Aso ( who is now Abe &apos;s finance minister ) were repeatedly rejected by the Diet &apos;s upper house , which was controlled by the opposition Democratic Party of Japan . 
The DPJ claimed that these candidates were too closely tied to the finance ministry , owing to long careers there , to act independently of it . 
But the real reason for their rejection was that the DPJ was intent on bringing down the LDP government , and thus was obstructing it whenever possible . 
Uncertainty reigned for a considerable time . 
But , in order for Japan to avoid being unrepresented by its central banker at a looming G-7 meeting of finance ministers , an agreement was reached at the last minute to appoint Shirakawa . 
Throughout his five-year tenure , Shirakawa has maintained a hawkish policy stance , insisting that monetary easing would have no possible benefit for Japan &apos;s long-stagnant economy . 
All that time , he faced consistent political pressure to determine a positive inflation target that would halt the country &apos;s deflationary spiral . 
But he resisted ever setting such a &quot; target . &quot; 
Only in January of this year , following the LDP &apos;s landslide election victory , did the BOJ set a target of 2 % price growth and issue a joint announcement with the government taking aim at deflation . 
This is the context in which the BOJ &apos;s next &quot; pope &quot; is being selected . 
But , instead of a debate about monetary policy , the only question being asked is whether Shirakawa &apos;s successor will come from the finance ministry , academia , or business . 
Abenomics &quot; goal is to escape two decades of deflation . 
Its purpose is not to encourage the depreciation of the yen , despite complaints about the yen &apos;s depreciation . 
With Europe &apos;s economy showing no sign of recovery and growing concern about a Chinese slowdown , Japan cannot afford to continue to tread water . 
As a responsible international stakeholder , Japan must stimulate its economy to provide an additional catalyst for global growth . 
Abe &apos;s government has now announced that Haruhiko Kuroda , the president of the Asian Development Bank and former Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs , will be its choice to succeed Shirakawa as BOJ Governor . 
Despite partisan bickering , the opposition will not resist the appointment of someone with both the vision and the administrative skills to act boldly . 
Japan , at long last , will not have to fight deflation with one hand tied behind its back .
