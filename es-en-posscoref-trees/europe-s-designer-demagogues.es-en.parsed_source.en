Europe \ u0027s Designer Demagogues 
The world needs a Europe committed to internationalism , generous to its former colonies , and willing to absorb its share of migrants and refugees . 
But in today &apos;s Europe , an successful electoral platform includes shutting out immigrants ( especially poor or black ones ) , abandoning multiculturalism in favor of &quot; cultural integration , &quot; limiting access to social welfare , halting or reversing the progress of European unification , and pouring police onto the streets . 
All of this looks like classic right-wing revanchism . 
But within , or alongside it , is a new kind of populism , unclassifiable in traditional terms . 
In France , Italy , Holland , Denmark , and Austria , rightist programs have re-shaped national elections and sometimes helped new parties into power . 
Through regional legislatures or influence on mainstream parties , the trend extends into Germany and Belgium . 
Even in Spain and Britain , where few electorally successful right-wing extremists exist , governments seek to pre-empt them by poaching their policies and their rhetoric . 
The old-style right , with its fascist ancestry , lingers on . 
Meanwhile , a new extremism - sleek , trendy , and cool - puts down roots . 
Its language is that of the Enlightenment , but made stylish , wired into the Zeitgeist . 
The old right can hardly compete ; but the establishment can hardly cope . 
The party founded by the flamboyant populist Pim Fortuyn is now the second largest in the Dutch legislature . 
Until his assassination , Fortuyn &apos;s rise was conspicuous because he flaunted his wealth in the land of &quot; the embarrassment of riches . &quot; 
He had a Bentley and butler , whereas most Dutch politicians make do with a housewife and a bicycle . 
He was showily louche and selectively libertarian , ostentatiously gay and indulgent on drugs . 
Branded as a racist , he replied , &quot; I like Moroccan boys : I sleep with them . &quot; 
But old right-wing planks formed much of his platform . 
Fortuyn proclaimed purity to be in danger : national culture ripe for a restorative purge . 
He demanded compulsory re-location of immigrant &quot; ghettos . &quot; 
Despite his homosexuality , he praised &quot; home values . &quot; 
He promised &quot; 20,000 fewer bureaucrats , 20,000 extra police . &quot; 
He offered outrage and hope to the traditional far-right constituency . 
And yet Fortuyn &apos;s demagogy was both different from and more insidious than the old fascism . 
His program spoke to genuine concerns of ordinary people - defending lifestyle-liberalism against religious orthodoxy , for instance ; advocating feminism and economic liberalism against benighted prejudices ; and strengthening security against terrorism . 
But behind it all lurked his misrepresentation of xenophobia as patriotism and his rejection of immigrants , not as black or brown , but as culturally backward . 
In Denmark , the Danish People &apos;s Party , which received 12 % of the vote in recent elections , similarly resists classification . 
Its program of slashing welfare benefits for immigrants is marketed as a &quot; defense of the welfare system &quot; against interlopers . 
Prime Minister Rasmussen praises a new ban on foreign spouses as a bulwark against forced marriages . 
What sets the new populism apart are these claims to liberal virtues . 
Old-fashioned fascists talked the language of order , so lovers of freedom rallied against them . 
The new right talks the language of liberty , and freedom lovers get suckered . 
Little will be genuinely free in a future crafted by these populists : &quot; liberalism &quot; behind barricades ; &quot; welfare &quot; that denies the most needy ; &quot; tolerance &quot; that allows some to be targets ; the un-liberating leader-cults of &quot; noisy little men , &quot; their nationalisms and their narrow-mindedness , their police priorities and procrustean plans for &quot; integrating &quot; minorities . 
Of course , a return to the Europe of the 1930s is not in the offing . 
The new right accepts capitalism and modernity , and it mostly avoids anti-Semitism . 
It is not revolutionary , nor does it preach violence . 
But modern does not mean moderate . 
The Danish People &apos;s Party leadership is frank about its hate-list : &quot; those who betray , who transfer power from Denmark to Brussels , who agree with having a multi-ethnic society . &quot; 
These new model nationalists need not win elections to recast Europe . 
They exploit electoral systems to enter government with a small share of the vote , or scare mainstream parties into adopting their policies . 
After the recent EU summit , JÃ¶rg Haider , leader of Austria &apos;s extreme-right Freedom Party , congratulated the Union on copying a stance for which he says he was &quot; labelled racist and fascist . &quot; 
An important law of politics is at work here : every integrative process provokes a fissile reaction . 
Europeanization stimulates nationalisms . 
So the EU can never be safe from a rising right . 
So now the mainstream is re-thinking its policies , aping or assimilating the extremists , hoping to emasculate them by embracing them in government , or luring their votes by imitating their agenda . 
Europe is in for a spell of designer demagogy that thrives in affluence or ennui . 
But it must be resisted , because domestic peace depends on mutual respect for cultural plurality , because Europe &apos;s changing demographic profile demands more open borders , not a gated continent , and because the new right &apos;s inherent chauvinism is irreconcilable with the EU &apos;s survival and success . 
The world should not only be worried ; it should be watching . 
We must choose between a new coziness that includes demagogic populists , or a candor that defies them .
