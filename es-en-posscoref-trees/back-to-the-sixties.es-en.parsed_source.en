Back to the Sixties 
BERKELEY - Complaints about the inflationary effects of American monetary policy are rampant , despite there being barely a hint of inflation in the United States . 
Rapidly growing catch-up economies are paddling furiously to avoid being dragged down by a torrent of capital inflows . 
Prominent policymakers , desperate for alternatives to America &apos;s malfunctioning monetary system , have gone so far as to allude to a return to the gold standard . 
I am not talking about 2011 , but about 1964 . 
We have been here before . 
In 1964 , it was the rapidly growing economies of Europe , still catching up to the US , that were howling about the Federal Reserve . 
As a result of a recklessly expansionary American policy , they argued , they were being flooded with imported finance . 
The US was &quot; exporting inflation . &quot; 
American officials countered that the financial inflows reflected Europe &apos;s underdeveloped capital markets . 
Europe &apos;s inflation problem was a byproduct of its central banks &quot; reluctance to tighten policy more aggressively , and European countries &quot; hesitancy to let their currencies rise , reflecting their long-standing commitment to export-led growth . 
Plus Ã§a change , as the French would say . 
What the French under General Charles de Gaulle actually did say was that fiat monies should be jettisoned in favor of the gold standard . 
But the French never explained exactly how restoration of the gold standard might be accomplished , or how it would translate into price and economic stability , given gold markets &quot; volatility and the disastrous consequences of the gold standard - not least in France - in the 1930 &quot; s . 
The debate , in other words , was as confused and confusing as it is today . 
Its one positive effect was to launch an effort to reform the international monetary system . 
So now that the French government - not them again ! - has committed to making international monetary reform the centerpiece of its G-20 presidency in 2011 , it is worth recalling the cautionary tale of the 1960 &quot; s . 
Back then , international monetary diplomacy focused on creating a new form of international reserves , what became the International Monetary Fund &apos;s Special Drawing Rights . 
The idea was that by issuing SDRs , the IMF would provide catch-up economies seeking to accumulate reserves with an alternative to piling up dollars . 
The US could no longer run balance-of-payments deficits &quot; without tears . &quot; 
American policy could be reined in without starving the global economy of liquidity . 
The effort failed completely . 
Special Drawing Rights never became an attractive alternative to the dollar , only modestly supplementing dollars and other national units in international use . 
Because they did not trust the IMF to assume the powers of a global central bank , the Fund &apos;s members established high hurdles to creating SDRs . 
Private markets in SDR-denominated instruments similarly failed to develop , in turn limiting their appeal to central banks . 
The other focus of negotiations in the 1960 &quot; s was an effort to enhance exchange-rate flexibility . 
Proposals to this effect - a response to the emergence of chronic surpluses in Germany and Italy , and chronic deficits in the US - attracted growing attention once the SDR negotiations sputtered to a close in 1968 . 
But , with other countries having enjoyed two decades of export-led growth as a result of pegging their currencies to the dollar , there was a reluctance to mess with success . 
While the IMF , in a high-profile report on exchange rates in mid-1970 , endorsed the principle of greater flexibility , it offered no new ideas for getting countries to move in this direction and proposed no new sanctions against countries that resisted . 
International imbalances continued to mount until the system came crashing down in 1971-1973 . 
The French government &apos;s recent hints about its reform agenda for 2011 suggest that , contrary to earlier speculation , an enhanced role for the SDR will not be at the center of its efforts . 
Rather , the Sarkozy administration will seek to develop mechanisms for managing the transition to an international currency system in which the dollar , the euro , and the renminbi all play consequential global roles . 
This is a step forward , one that reflects real learning from history . 
The absence of such sanctions was a critical weakness of the original Bretton Woods system , and it remains a central weakness of our own - not coincidentally referred to as Bretton Woods 2 . 
Without sanctions to police global imbalances , the French step forward will take us halfway across a yawning chasm . 
In mid-air , with neither firm ground below nor enough momentum to make it to the other side , is not where the global economy should be .
