Who &apos;s Afraid of Tapering ? 
TOKYO - The US Federal Reserve &apos;s gradual exit from so-called quantitative easing ( QE ) - open-ended purchases of long-term assets - has financial markets and policymakers worried , with warnings of capital flight from developing economies and collapsing asset prices dominating policy discussions worldwide . 
But , given that most major economies operate under a flexible exchange-rate regime , these concerns are largely unwarranted . 
The logic behind the fear of the Fed &apos;s &quot; tapering &quot; of QE is straightforward . 
Unconventional monetary policy in the United States - and in other advanced countries , particularly the United Kingdom and Japan - drove down domestic interest rates , while flooding international financial markets with liquidity . 
In search of higher yields , investors took that liquidity - largely in the form of short-term speculative capital ( &quot; hot &quot; money ) - to emerging markets , putting upward pressure on their exchange rates and fueling the risk of asset bubbles . 
Thus , the Fed &apos;s withdrawal from QE would be accompanied by a capital-flow reversal , increasing borrowing costs and hampering GDP growth . 
Of course , not all emerging markets , according to this logic , are equally exposed . 
Among the most vulnerable countries are Turkey , South Africa , Brazil , India , and Indonesia - the so-called &quot; Fragile Five &quot; - all of which are characterized by twin fiscal and current-account deficits , high inflation , in addition to faltering GDP growth . 
This logic would be correct if the world were operating under a fixed exchange-rate regime , with governments tying official exchange rates to another country &apos;s currency or the price of gold . 
Under these conditions , monetary contraction ( or slowing expansion ) would have a recessionary ( or a less stimulative ) impact on other economies . 
With flexible exchange rates , however , monetary-policy contraction in a major economy would stimulate other economies in the short run , while monetary expansion would damage their performance . 
( To be sure , in the medium or long run , monetary expansion can facilitate increased domestic production and trade , thereby generating positive spillover effects . ) 
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 , the rapid expansion of the money supply in the US and the UK triggered a sharp appreciation of the Japanese yen , as well as of some emerging-market currencies . 
In short , QE is what merits concern - not its termination . 
Of course , the Fed &apos;s policy reversal could hurt countries that maintain fixed - or , like China , &quot; managed floating &quot; - exchange rates . 
Likewise , weaker eurozone economies like Greece and Spain , which would prefer stronger monetary stimulus than their more competitive counterparts in Europe are willing to accept , may suffer . 
But , given that these economies have chosen to adhere to a fixed exchange rate , the Fed cannot really be blamed for the fallout . 
In fact , the Fed - and other advanced-country central banks - should not be blamed for the negative effects of monetary expansion , either . 
Japan &apos;s bold monetary easing , for example , was a critical element of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s strategy for lifting the Japanese economy out of more than a decade of recession - and it has led to a remarkable recovery . 
The problem is that the policy has also caused the yen to depreciate , leading nearby countries to accuse Japan of adopting &quot; beggar-thy-neighbor &quot; policies . 
Similarly , emerging-market officials warned that monetary expansion in the US and the UK would trigger a wave of competitive currency devaluations , with Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega going so far as to accuse the Fed and the Bank of England of waging a full-blown &quot; currency war . &quot; 
But , while it is true that such expansionary policies can have a recessionary impact on other economies , modern international-finance theory shows that the concept of a &quot; currency war &quot; is a myth . 
The reality is that , under a flexible exchange-rate regime , competitive devaluations do not produce undesirable imbalances . 
On the contrary , they can bolster recovery in participating economies . 
In fact , currency devaluations were critical to ending the Great Depression . 
The fact is that , with a flexible exchange rate , a country can offset the recessionary impact of a neighboring country &apos;s monetary easing using its own independent monetary policy , guided by carefully chosen inflation targets . 
If all countries adopt this approach , the entire global economy benefits . 
By working to revive the domestic economy , the Fed , like other advanced-country central banks , is simply fulfilling its mandate . 
Instead of complaining about its actions , emerging-country policymakers should be devising strategies for offsetting the spillover effects on their own economies . 
After all , they have the tools to do so .
