Who Owns Bolivia ? 
A few months ago , Evo Morales became Bolivia &apos;s first democratically elected indigenous head of state . 
Indigenous groups constitute 62 % of Bolivia &apos;s population , and those with mixed blood another 30 % , but for 500 years Bolivians had been ruled by colonial powers and their descendants . 
Well into the twentieth century , indigenous groups were effectively deprived of a vote and a voice . 
Aymara and Quechua , their languages , were not even recognized for conducting public business . 
So Morales &quot; election was historic , and the excitement in Bolivia is palpable . 
But Morales &quot; nationalization of Bolivia &apos;s oil and gas fields sent shock waves through the international community . 
During his campaign , Morales made clear his intention to increase state control over national gas and oil . 
But he had made it equally clear that he did not intend to expropriate the property of energy firms - he wanted foreign investors to stay . 
( Nationalization does not , of course , necessarily mean expropriation without appropriate compensation . ) 
Perhaps surprising for modern politicians , Morales took his words seriously . 
Genuinely concerned about raising the incomes of his desperately poor people , he recognized that Bolivia needs foreigners &quot; expertise to achieve growth , and that this entails paying fairly for their services . 
But are foreign owners getting more than a fair rate of return ? 
Morales &quot; actions are widely supported by Bolivians , who see the so-called privatizations ( or &quot; capitalizations &quot; ) under former President Gonzalo &quot; Goni &quot; Sanchez de Lozada as a rip-off : Bolivia received only 18 % of the proceeds ! 
Bolivians wonder why investments of some $ 3 billion should entitle foreign investors to 82 % of the country &apos;s vast gas reserves , now estimated to be worth $ 250 billion . 
While there has not yet been full disclosure of returns , or an audit of the true value of investments , it appears that investors would , at the old terms , have recouped all their money within just four years . 
Bolivians also ask why foreigners reap all the benefits of today &apos;s high prices for oil and gas ? 
It costs no more to extract oil or gas today than it did when prices were one-third of their current level . 
Yet , the foreign oil companies get 82 % of the increase - in the case of oil , this would amount to a windfall for them of $ 32 a barrel or more . 
No wonder that Bolivians thought they were being cheated and demanded a new deal . 
On May 2 , Morales simply reversed the percentages , pending renegotiation of the contracts : the companies operating in the two largest fields would get 18 % of the production for themselves . 
As part of this new deal , Bolivia should also get a larger share when prices increase . 
( Bolivia may , of course , not want to bear the risk of a fall in the price , so it may strike a deal to transfer some of the downside risk to foreign companies , giving them in exchange more of the upside potential . ) 
To most Bolivians , what is at stake is a matter of fairness : Should foreign oil and gas companies get a fair return on their capital , or a supernormal return ? 
Should Bolivia be paid a fair value for its resources ? 
And should Bolivia , or foreign companies , reap most of the windfall gains from increases in energy prices ? 
Moreover , many deals were apparently done in secret by previous governments - and apparently without the approval of Congress . 
Indeed , because Bolivia &apos;s Constitution requires the approval of Congress for such sales , it isn &apos;t clear that Morales is nationalizing anything : the assets were never properly sold . 
When a country is robbed of a national art treasure , we don &apos;t call its return &quot; re-nationalization , &quot; because it belonged to the country all along . 
As with many privatizations elsewhere , there are questions as to whether the foreign investors have kept their side of the bargain . 
Bolivia contributed to these joint enterprises not only with resources , but also with previous investments . 
The foreign companies &quot; contribution was supposed to be further investment . 
But did they fully live up to their commitments ? 
Are accounting gimmicks being used to overstate the true value of foreign capital contributions ? 
Bolivia &apos;s government has , so far , simply raised questions , and set in motion a process for ascertaining the answer . 
The problem in Bolivia is a lack of transparency , both when contracts are signed and afterwards . 
Without transparency , it is easy for citizens to feel that they are being cheated - and they often are . 
When foreign companies get a deal that is too good to be true , there is often something underhanded going on . 
Around the world , oil and gas companies have themselves to blame : too often , they have resisted calls for greater transparency . 
In the future , companies and countries should agree on a simple principle : there should be , to paraphrase President Woodrow Wilson &apos;s memorable words , &quot; open contracts , openly and transparently arrived at . &quot; 
If the Bolivians do not get fair value for their country &apos;s natural wealth , their prospects are bleak . 
Even if they do , they will need assistance , not only to extract their resources , but also to improve the health and education of all Bolivians - to ensure long-term economic growth and social welfare . 
For now , the world should celebrate the fact that Bolivia has a democratically elected leader attempting to represent the interests of the poor people of his country . 
It is a historic moment .
