Two Wrongs Don &apos;t Make a Right at the IMF and World Bank 
One has go back to the &quot; Year of Three Popes &quot; ( 1978 ) to find a succession drama as strange as what has been happening at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , the two pillars of the global financial system . 
Two months ago , Bank President Paul Wolfowitz resigned amidst an extraordinary staff mutiny and governance debacle . 
Now , his counterpart at the International Monetary Fund , the former Spanish Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato , has shocked major stakeholders by announcing that he , too , will leave in October . 
To lose one international lending institution head is misfortune , to lose two looks like carelessness ( my apologies to Oscar Wilde ) . 
Coming on the tenth year anniversary of the Asian financial crisis , the caldron in which today &apos;s ultra-liquid capital markets were forged , conspiracy theories abound . 
Frankly , sticking to the public record , the two resignations seem like night and day . 
When Wolfowitz was finally pushed out after a bruising battle , Bank staff were beside themselves with joy . 
By contrast , most IMF staff seem genuinely depressed by Rato &apos;s departure . 
Wolfowitz &apos;s pre-Bank claim to fame was his role as an architect of the Iraq war , arguably one of the greatest strategic debacles since Napoleon &apos;s invasion of Russia . 
Rato , by contrast , was Spain &apos;s finance minister during the country &apos;s best economic era since the sixteenth century . 
Under Wolfowitz , the World Bank failed to introduce any serious governance reforms to reflect the rising economic power of Asia . 
Under Rato , the IMF at least took some modest steps towards giving China and other rapidly emerging markets more say in running the place . 
At the same time as Rato pushed reluctant European nations to yield some of their power in the Fund , he introduced reforms that clarified and strengthened the Fund &apos;s role in managing exchange rates . 
Indeed , a week before Rato &apos;s resignation announcement , the Fund asserted that it had the right to censure countries whose intervention policies threaten to undermine global economic stability . 
The Fund &apos;s policy change drew the ire of Chinese officials , who have been intervening on a biblical scale to hold down the value of their currency , the Yuan . 
When the Fund gets the big boys to complain by saying perfectly sensible things , it must be doing something right . 
True , the Fund has been notably soft on the United States of late , downplaying the continuing vulnerabilities posed by the gaping US current account and trade deficits . 
One imagines this compelling theme will return soon enough . 
Although there are vast differences surrounding the departure of the IMF and Bank heads , there are some worrisome similarities . 
First , there is every sign that the Europeans will use Rato &apos;s sudden announcement as an excuse to avoid a serious debate about relinquishing their privilege of always appointing the Fund &apos;s head True the US was able to essentially blackmail the world into choosing yet another American to replace Wolfowitz , by balking at efforts to push him out peaceably . 
But the Europeans have no such leverage at the Fund , where Rato has elected to go out under his own steam . 
There is ample time between now and October for the IMF to install an open and fair selection process that will lead to the best person being chosen , regardless of nationality . 
Central banks around the world have been enormously successful by choosing technocrats and people with proven knowledge and experience to head their institutions , rather than accepting purely political appointments . 
On merit , some of the obvious candidates for the Fund job , such as Brazilian Arminio Fraga , and Egyptian-born Mohamed El-Erian , are not European . 
A second similarity is that both institutions face deep existential crises . 
In today &apos;s world of deep and liquid global financial markets , the main lending instruments of the IMF and and the Bank are largely unnecessary and redundant . 
Absent serious reform , both are on tract to go into deep hibernation as the Bank for International Settlements did for forty years prior to its recent resurgence . 
The BIS , founded in 1930 to help manage German reparation payments and to coordinate activities among central banks , served as little more than repository for gold reserves in the years following World War II . 
As central banks have gained status in recent years , and thanks to imaginative leadership , the BIS has reawakened and taken on a number of important roles , including setting international regulatory standards for global banking . 
While it is encouraging to know that a hibernating IMF and World Bank may some day reawaken , it would be far better to see them invigorated now . 
A more globalized world needs global financial institutions , but ones that focus on coordination , supervision and technical advice , not redundant lending mechanisms . 
Before any real change can place , both institutions require fundamental governance changes . 
The puzzling circumstances of the IMF head &apos;s sudden departure announcement do not justify a business as usual approach to his replacement . 
Nor does the closed-door succession process at the Bank , where the US continued its sixty year lock on the Presidency , justify continuing European monopolization of the Fund job . 
Two wrongs do not make a right .
