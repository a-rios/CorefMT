Recovering from Kosovo 
LONDON - Kosovo &apos;s recent unilateral declaration of independence brought back memories . 
I publicly opposed NATO &apos;s attack on Serbia - carried out in the name of protecting the Kosovars from Serb atrocities - in March 1999 . 
At that time , I was a member of the Opposition Front Bench - or Shadow Government - in Britain &apos;s House of Lords . 
The then Conservative leader , William Hague , immediately expelled me to the &quot; back benches . &quot; 
Thus ended my ( minor ) political career . 
Ever since , I have wondered whether I was right or wrong . 
I opposed military intervention for two reasons . 
First , I argued that while it might do local good , it would damage the rules of international relations as they were then understood . 
The UN charter was designed to prevent the use of force across national lines except for self-defense and enforcement measures ordered by the Security Council . 
Human rights , democracy , and self-determination are not acceptable legal grounds for waging war . 
Secondly , I argued that while there might be occasions when , regardless of international law , human rights abuses are so severe that one is morally obliged to act , Kosovo was not such a case . 
I considered the &quot; imminent humanitarian disaster &quot; that the intervention was ostensibly aimed at preventing , to be largely an invention . 
I further argued that non-military means to resolve the humanitarian issue in Kosovo were far from being exhausted , and that the failed Rambouillet negotiation with Serbia in February-March 1999 was , in Henry Kissinger &apos;s words , &quot; merely an excuse to start the bombing . &quot; 
This view was vindicated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe &apos;s Report on Human Rights Violations in Kosovo , published in December 1999 . 
The report showed that the level of violence fell markedly when OSCE monitors were placed in Kosovo following the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement of September 23 , 1998 ; and that it was only after the monitors were withdrawn on March 20 , 1999 , in preparation for the bombing that general and systematic violation of human rights began . 
Between March and June 1999 - the period of NATO bombing - the number of deaths and expulsions in Kosovo shot up . 
The &quot; humanitarian disaster &quot; was in fact precipitated by the war itself . 
Despite this , the term &quot; genocide , &quot; freely bandied about by Western interventionists , was grotesquely inappropriate at any time . 
Without doubt , NATO air strikes and the subsequent administration of Kosovo as a protectorate improved the political situation for Albanian Kosovars . 
Without NATO intervention , they probably would have remained second-class citizens within Serbia . 
Against this must be set large-scale deterioration in the economic situation of all Kosovars , Albanian and Serbian ( 44 % unemployment ) , widespread criminalization , and the fact that under NATO rule , Kosovo was ethnically cleansed of half its Serb minority . 
Kosovo remains in political limbo to this day . 
Two thousand European Union officials run the country , and 16,000 NATO troops guard its security . 
Its &quot; independence &quot; is rejected by Serbia , unrecognized by the Security Council , and opposed by Russia , China , and most multi-national states in Europe and Asia , which fear setting a precedent for their own dismemberment . 
Indeed , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to blame the disturbances in Tibet on Kosovo &apos;s declaration of independence . 
A Serbian insurgency and de facto partition of Kosovo remain possible , and we have yet to face the destabilizing effects of Kosovo &apos;s claim to independence on other divided Balkan states such as Bosnia and Macedonia But the balance sheet is even worse in terms of international relations . 
Kosovo was a stalking horse for Iraq , as the doctrine of humanitarian intervention morphed into President George W. Bush &apos;s doctrine of &quot; pre-emptive war , &quot; by which the US claimed the right to attack any state that it deemed a threat to its national security . 
As then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan rightly argued , this opened the door to the proliferation of unilateral , lawless use of force . 
Not the least damaging consequence of the Bush doctrine is that it dispenses with the need for public proof of aggressive intent . 
The Iraq invasion was justified by the same use of fraudulent evidence as was displayed in Kosovo . 
On balance , I believe that I was right to oppose the Kosovo war . 
It was a regressive answer to a genuine international problem : how to hold together multi-ethnic / religious states in a reasonably civilized way . 
Since 1999 , Kosovars have rejected Serbian offers of autonomy , because they were confident of American support for independence . 
Western countries must consider more seriously how far they should press their human rights agenda on states with both the power and the will to defend their territorial integrity . 
Under American leadership , it is the West that has emerged as the restless , disturbing force in international affairs . 
China should certainly grant Tibet more autonomy ; but is pumping up the Dalai Lama into a world leader or threatening to boycott the Beijing Olympics the best way to secure a better deal for Tibetans , or to obtain Chinese cooperation on matters that are far more important than Tibet &apos;s status ? 
Activists , impassioned by the justice of their cause , will not consider these questions . 
But world leaders should take them seriously .
