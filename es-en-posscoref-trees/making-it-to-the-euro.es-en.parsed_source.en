Making it to the Euro 
The upcoming enlargement of the European Union in May is a major focus not only for governments in the acceding countries , but also for their central banks . 
Upon entry , they will become members of the European Central Bank , which means that the new members are expected to take active steps towards fulfilling the necessary conditions for future admission into the eurozone . 
Even though actual enlargement of the eurozone remains in the relatively distant future - the earliest possible date being January 2007 - the accession countries must prepare their entry strategies well in advance . 
This is why in most accession countries last year , central banks and governments stepped up co-operation on defining joint positions on adopting the euro . 
Similarly , there were intense debates within the EU , culminating with the adoption of the ECB &apos;s Policy Position on Exchange Rate Issues Relating to the Acceding Countries . 
The Policy Position expressed the ECB Governing Council &apos;s stance on membership of the exchange rate mechanism ( ERM II ) , a key precondition for future eurozone entry . 
Debate was heated . 
The accession countries had to decide the optimal timing for eurozone enlargement - a difficult task , because economic theory gives no clear answers in this respect , and because several accession countries are wrestling with fiscal imbalances well above the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s ceiling of 3 % of GDP . 
The EU side , for its part , had to address the problem of how to balance fairness of treatment between old and new eurozone members with ensuring a smooth enlargement . 
There may be a certain trade-off between these two aspects , since the EU &apos;s accession criteria were defined at a time when the eurozone did not exist and when best practices in exchange rate and monetary policy regimes differed from current ones . 
Nevertheless , a broad consensus has emerged on a number of issues . 
First , most people have learned that no universal solution is optimal for all accession countries . 
There are many country-specific conditions , such as current economic performance , the monetary policy regime , and the fiscal stance . 
In this respect , the accession countries can be divided into two broad groups . 
On one side are small countries - for example , the Baltic states - which use devices such as currency boards to peg their exchange rates to the euro . 
These countries have proven that they can live without their own monetary policies without severe tensions . 
There is thus no reason to caution them against fast eurozone accession or to force them to change their exchange rate regimes before entry . 
So EU institutions are right to acknowledge currency boards as being consistent with the ERM II regime , even though they have at the same time reserved the discretion to assess each country on a case-by-case basis . 
On the other hand , it is clear that the roadmap to the eurozone might be completely different for the larger accession countries with floating exchange rates and inflation-targeting monetary policy regimes . 
A second area of consensus has emerged from frequent debates on the potential conflict between nominal and real economic convergence between the EU accession countries and the current member states . 
But most accession countries have already achieved substantial progress in lowering inflation and nominal interest rates . 
Moreover , many empirical analyses show that real convergence should not be a serious obstacle to enlargement . 
Thus the main emphasis has shifted to structural , financial , and cyclical convergence , in line with economic theory on so-called &quot; optimum currency areas . &quot; 
It is typically found that the degree of convergence is very high in terms of foreign trade , capital flows , and banking sector integration , while cyclical convergence and labor mobility have been low so far . 
Important differences exist , though , among the individual countries even in this respect . 
Third , although the Central European countries originally announced different target dates for eurozone accession , their plans have now moved closer together , usually ranging between 2008 and 2010 . 
The biggest practical constraint they face is their public budgets . 
Many countries - including the Czech Republic , Hungary , and Poland - run large budget deficits and need to implement medium-term reforms to make their pension systems sustainable and to overhaul overly generous social security systems . 
Given the political sensitivity of these issues , fiscal consolidation will be challenging . 
Fourth , it is vital that EU institutions have spoken more openly about the convergence criteria . 
Most critically , the ECB has de-emphasized in its Policy Position the former Â± 2.25 % fluctuation band in the ERM II as the criterion for assessing exchange rate stability . 
This corresponds to the view shared by many accession countries that such a narrow band would increase the risks in managing the run-up to adopting the euro . 
Instead , exchange rate stability will be assessed according to economic fundamentals and countries &apos; economic policy mix , rather than by rigidly applying mechanical rules . 
Finally , the ECB has proposed a reform of the voting mechanism in its Governing Council , introducing a cap on the number of voting members . 
Even though many , including myself , do not see it as an optimal final solution , it is an important compromise that will allow eurozone enlargement to start . 
The work done during 2003 brought eurozone enlargement much closer . 
Some countries may proceed faster , especially those with hard pegs against the euro , while for others the years 2008-2010 seem to be a more realistic target . 
But in most cases , entry strategies have been set , serving as important stabilizers for financial markets and economic agents .
