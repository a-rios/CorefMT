Remaking the Money Market 
CAMBRIDGE - Last month , at a US Federal Reserve Bank conference on the money market , officials lamented the market &apos;s enduring fragility . 
Indeed , six years after a run on the money market nearly brought the United States - indeed , global - financial system to its knees , critical risks that underpinned that crisis still have not been brought under control . 
At its core , the money market serves the need of a firm or nonprofit institution to store cash that it can access on a moment &apos;s notice . 
A university , for example , must set aside a portion of students &quot; tuition payments to cover unexpected expenses . 
But the sum is larger than $ 250,000 - the maximum that the government insures in a single account . 
Seeking more security for its cash , the university may turn to US Treasury bonds . 
The process is simple . 
The university deposits the money in a bank for a short period - often just one day - with the bank providing a US Treasury bond as collateral . 
If the bank does not return the cash the next day , the university can sell the bond , keep the cash it is owed , and return any excess to the bank . 
It is almost as safe as a government-insured bank deposit . 
If only universities engaged in such practices , the money market would not have grown large enough to damage the economy so deeply in 2008 and 2009 . 
But large businesses waiting to invest excess cash make the same types of cash deposits with banks - millions of dollars at a time - owing to the same unwillingness to rely solely on a bank &apos;s promise to safeguard anything over $ 250,000 . 
Moreover , ordinary savers use their cash to buy shares in money-market funds , which lend that cash to financial institutions , getting long-term US Treasury bonds as collateral and promises of next-day repayment . 
And hedge funds park the cash that they receive from investors in the money market while waiting for promising long-term investments to arise . 
In short , the money market is not just a few institutions managing a few billion dollars of cash . 
It is a massive multi-trillion-dollar market . 
Indeed , it was a $ 4 trillion market just before the financial crisis , with its reduction to less than $ 3 trillion during the crisis disrupting real economic activity . 
But the money market &apos;s size is not the only reason for its fragility . 
Another problem is that banks are not the only institutions managing it . 
The key to making money-market transactions work is the borrower &apos;s ownership of a Treasury bond that it can offer to the &quot; depositor &quot; as collateral . 
Given this , any sufficiently large institution with such bonds can imitate the bank &apos;s lending role - and many non-bank institutions do , often obscured from the watchful eye of regulators . 
The money market thus extends well beyond the regulated banking system into so-called &quot; shadow banking . &quot; 
The final problem is that such thinly capitalized non-banks do not just offer solid US Treasury obligations as collateral ; they also provide weaker securities , such as aggregations of mortgages . 
These securities are not US obligations , carry no government guarantee , and do not retain their intrinsic value in a crisis . 
When a crisis erupts and lenders cannot return the cash , &quot; depositors &quot; prepare to sell the collateral . 
But while prices for US government bonds can withstand a large-scale sell-off , those for mortgage bonds cannot - especially if , as during the recent financial crisis , the housing market is weakened . 
The prospect of that sell-off put the solvency of many financial institutions at risk , leading the US government to bail out the money market , the mortgage-bond market , and the infamous Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which backed many of the mortgage securities . 
There are three ways to make the money market safer . 
The first is to make the institutions providing the quasi-money safer by increasing their capital . 
The second is to limit the total size of unregulated transactions that any one institution can conduct . 
The third is to allow this kind of lending only against rock-solid collateral , such as Treasury bonds - not mortgage-backed securities , which can lose value quickly during a crisis , requiring a government bailout . 
The government should decide up front which types of collateral it will guarantee in a crisis , instead of being backed into a corner when markets , institutions , and collateral that it never pledged to support are on the brink of collapse . 
Money-market institutions cannot be counted on to take these systemic safety-oriented steps themselves . 
The transactions are too profitable in ordinary economic times , and they know that , if another crisis arises , the government will again be compelled to support the market and shore up weakened financial institutions . 
It is therefore up to policymakers to reduce the financial risk that the money market generates . 
But the prevalence of shadow banking institutions , which do not hold traditional bank charters and are not subject to bank regulation , complicates such efforts . 
A full solution would focus on preventing all institutions from offering weaker forms of collateral . 
As Ed Morrison , Christopher Sontchi , and I proposed at the end of last month &apos;s Fed conference , US regulators must change the rules to prohibit mortgage-backed and other weak securities from being used so extensively in the money market , unless the government decides up front to back them fully . 
The weaker collateral could be used elsewhere - just not for parking money overnight . 
For that , safer securities should be required . 
If US policymakers adopt this approach , the tone of the Fed &apos;s next money market conference could be much more optimistic .
