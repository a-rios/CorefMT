Solving Syria in the Security Council 
NEW YORK - The ongoing bloodletting in Syria is not only the world &apos;s greatest humanitarian disaster by far , but also one of its gravest geopolitical risks . 
The solution to the Syrian crisis , including the growing refugee crisis in Europe , must run through the United Nations Security Council . 
The roots of US strategy in Syria lie in a strange- and unsuccessful - union of two sources of American foreign policy . 
One comprises the US security establishment , including the military , the intelligence agencies , and their staunch supporters in Congress . 
The other source emerges from the human-rights community . 
Their peculiar merger has been evident in many recent US wars in the Middle East and Africa . 
Unfortunately , the results have been consistently devastating . 
The security establishment is driven by US policymakers &quot; long-standing reliance on military force and covert operations to topple regimes deemed to be harmful to American interests . 
From the 1953 toppling of Mohammad Mossadegh &apos;s democratically elected government in Iran and the &quot; other 9 / 11 &quot; ( the US-backed military coup in 1973 against Chile &apos;s democratically elected Salvador Allende ) to Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , and now Syria , regime change has long been the coin of the US security realm . 
At the same time , parts of the human-rights community have backed recent US military interventions on the grounds of the &quot; Responsibility to Protect , &quot; or R2P . 
This doctrine , adopted unanimously by the UN General Assembly in 2005 , holds that the international community is obliged to intervene to protect a civilian population under massive attack by its own government . 
In the face of the brutality of Saddam Hussein , Muammar el-Qaddafi , and Assad , some human-rights advocates made common cause with the US security establishment , while China , Russia , and others have argued that R2P has become a pretext for US-led regime change . 
The problem , as human-rights advocates should have learned long ago , is that the US security establishment &apos;s regime-change model does not work . 
What appears to be a &quot; quick fix &quot; to protect local populations and US interests often devolves into chaos , anarchy , civil war , and burgeoning humanitarian crises , as has happened in Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , and now Syria . 
The risks of failure multiply whenever the UN Security Council as a whole does not back the military part of the intervention . 
The US intervention in Syria can also be traced to decisions taken by the security establishment a quarter-century ago to overthrow Soviet-backed regimes in the Middle East . 
As then-Under Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz explained to General Wesley Clark in 1991 : &quot; We learned that we can intervene militarily in the region with impunity , and the Soviets won &apos;t do a thing to stop us ... &#91; We &apos;ve &#93; got about five to ten years to take out these old Soviet &quot; surrogate &quot; regimes - Iraq , Syria , and the rest - before the next superpower &#91; China &#93; comes along to challenge us in the region . &quot; 
When al-Qaeda struck the US on September 11 , 2001 , the attack was used as a pretext by the security establishment to launch its long-desired war to topple Saddam . 
When the Arab Spring protests erupted a decade later , the US security establishment viewed the sudden vulnerability of the Qaddafi and Assad regimes as a similar opportunity to install new regimes in Libya and Syria . 
Such was the theory , at any rate . 
In the case of Syria , America &apos;s regional allies also told President Barack Obama &apos;s administration to move on Assad . 
Saudi Arabia wanted Assad gone to weaken a client state of Iran , the kingdom &apos;s main rival for regional primacy . 
Israel wanted Assad gone to weaken Iran &apos;s supply lines to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon . 
The humanitarian community joined the regime-change chorus when Assad responded to Arab Spring protesters &quot; demand for political liberalization by unleashing the army and paramilitaries . 
From March to August 2011 , Assad &apos;s forces killed around 2,000 people . 
At that point , Obama declared that Assad must &quot; step aside . &quot; 
We don &apos;t know the full extent of US actions in Syria after that . 
On the diplomatic level , the US organized the &quot; Friends of Syria , &quot; mainly Western countries and Middle East allies committed to Assad &apos;s overthrow . 
The CIA began to work covertly with Turkey to channel arms , financing , and non-lethal support to the so-called &quot; Free Syrian Army &quot; and other insurgent groups operating to topple Assad . 
The results have been an unmitigated disaster . 
While roughly 500 people per month were killed from March to August 2011 , some 100,000 civilians - around 3,200 per month - died between September 2011 and April 2015 , with the total number of dead , including combatants , reaching perhaps 310,000 , or 10,000 per month . 
And , with the Islamic State and other brutal extremist groups capitalizing on the anarchy created by the civil war , the prospect of peace is more distant than ever . 
Military intervention led or backed by the US in Afghanistan , Iraq , and Libya has produced similar debacles . 
Toppling a regime is one thing ; replacing it with a stable and legitimate government is quite another . 
If the US wants better results , it should stop going it alone . 
The US cannot impose its will unilaterally , and trying to do so has merely arrayed other powerful countries , including China and Russia , against it . 
Like the US , Russia has a strong interest in stability in Syria and in defeating the Islamic State ; but it has no interest in allowing the US to install its choice of regimes in Syria or elsewhere in the region . 
That is why all efforts by the UN Security Council to forge a common position on Syria have so far foundered . 
But the UN route can and must be tried again . 
The nuclear pact between Iran and the Security Council &apos;s five permanent members ( the US , China , France , Russia , and the UK ) plus Germany , has just provided a powerful demonstration of the Council &apos;s capacity to lead . 
It can lead in Syria as well , if the US will set aside its unilateral demand for regime change and work with the rest of the Council , including China and Russia , on a common approach . 
In Syria , only multilateralism can succeed . 
The UN remains the world &apos;s best - indeed its only - hope to stop the Syrian bloodbath and halt the flood of refugees to Europe .
