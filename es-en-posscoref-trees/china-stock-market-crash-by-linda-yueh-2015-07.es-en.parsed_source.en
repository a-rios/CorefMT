China &apos;s Abnormal Stock Market 
LONDON - China &apos;s stock market has plunged yet again , this time by 8.5 % - the market &apos;s second-largest fall in a single day , and the largest since the global financial crisis . 
The roller-coaster ride is far from over . 
In fact , China &apos;s stock market is more like a casino than an amusement-park attraction . 
Retail investors account for 85 % of trades , in contrast to other major markets , where institutional investors - with their relative abundance of information - are the biggest traders . 
The result , no surprise , is an extremely volatile market , in which rumor and emotion play an outsize role in driving outcomes . 
And that volatility is the other reason why the casino metaphor applies : China &apos;s stock market can rise or fall by double digits without triggering a wider economic crash - at least so far . 
For example , China &apos;s GDP growth was unaffected ( in fact , the economy was growing at nearly 10 % ) when the stock market lost half of its value between 2001 and 2005 - or , for that matter , when the market then recovered ( only to fall dramatically again after the 2008 financial crisis ) . 
Since then , China &apos;s stock market has been a global laggard - that is , until the past year , when it became the best performing in the world , rising by more than 150 % . 
And yet the roller-coaster pattern continues : the 8.5 % plunge came when the market re-opened on a Monday that followed the largest two-day rise since 2008 . 
That rise had been preceded by a loss of nearly one-third of the market &apos;s value from mid-June to early July . 
This volatility highlights the challenges of ensuring a smooth process of financial liberalization in China . 
After extensive government intervention prohibited some selling of shares and froze trading for the bulk of the market , prices rebounded . 
The reason is that the Chinese stock market is not wholly liquid or globally integrated . 
Moreover , it is dominated by captive money from Chinese savers - the retail investors . 
Indeed , it was not until 2009 that most shares on China &apos;s stock exchanges were tradable . 
Until the reforms that began in 2005 , two-thirds of shares were non-tradable and held by state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) or legal persons , which are typically state-controlled entities . 
Indeed , private firms still comprise a minority of China &apos;s listed companies , though today fewer than 30 % of shares cannot be traded . 
To be sure , that has led to a huge infusion of liquidity over just the past few years . 
But China also imposes capital-account restrictions on portfolio-investment flows , which means that its stock markets remain relatively closed . 
Until the recent launch of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect corridor , which links the two markets , international investors could not directly buy A-shares on the mainland exchanges . 
Direct purchases remain subject to a quota , in the form of a limited number of so-called Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor licenses . 
By the same token , aside from the very wealthy , who benefit from personal connections and other devices , the hundreds of millions of ordinary Chinese savers who have achieved middle-class status do not have easy access to global markets . 
Moreover , returns on deposits are low ( and had been negative ) , and the state-dominated financial system offers few diversified products . 
As a result , housing and domestic equities are the main investments available to them . 
But then the housing market stalled , as fears of a property bubble spurred a government clampdown on credit , leaving the stock market the place for middle-class savers to put their money . 
The ensuing boom was a mirror image of the pattern between 1998 and 2001 , when the housing market was liberalized and the stock market fell . 
The big question now is whether the recent volatility will spill over into other asset markets and the real economy . 
The double-digit drop in the Shanghai Composite Index since June has not triggered an economic crisis largely because fewer than 10 % of Chinese households participate in the stock market , and equities comprise less than 15 % of household assets . 
But even a small fraction of Chinese households experiencing paper losses still amounts to tens of millions of people . 
That has caused enough concern for the government to act , including by relaxing collateral requirements to permit real-estate assets to be used to cover margin calls . 
It was , in fact , the authorities &quot; clampdown on margin borrowing , together with a loss in confidence as global markets declined , that is thought to have triggered the market meltdown . 
And that , too , is a feature of a market dominated by small traders : the &quot; herding &quot; behavior that fuels major booms and busts becomes more prevalent , because individuals assume that others have better information . 
The result , as we are now witnessing , is that a moderate sell-off can easily turn into a stampede . 
And government intervention to block the exits is inadequate . 
On the contrary , until China &apos;s stock market opens up and its institutional foundation becomes predictable , volatility will be its only guiding rule .
