China \ u0027s Virtual Revolution 
After eight years of explosive growth , there are now almost as many internet users in China as there are members of the 70-million-strong Communist Party . 
China &apos;s &quot; information elite , &quot; the largely urban , educated , professionals who are China &apos;s internet surfers , are becoming a force of equal size to the ruling political power base . 
What will this new center of power mean for the transformation of Chinese society ? 
Since the mid-1990s , China &apos;s government has promoted the rapid growth of the internet for its economic benefits . 
The government employs a host of new legal regulations , a shadowy internet police force , and a powerful hardware-based national information filtering system . 
Control also relies on the demography of internet users , most of whom belong to China &apos;s economic elite and are more likely to adopt the internet as part of a newfound consumer lifestyle than as a tool for political or social revolution . 
What is surprising is that the government &apos;s control mechanisms have been largely effective . 
After two and a half decades of market-oriented economic reform , Chinese citizens are increasingly aware of how to protect their economic and social interests by using the language of rights . 
When confronting abuses of power , people are increasingly using a new term , &quot; weiquan &quot; ( defending rights ) , to challenge the system . 
Another new term , &quot; zhi qing quan &quot; ( right to know ) , has also entered public discourse . 
The new terminology inspired by the information technology revolution was especially prevalent after the SARS outbreak last spring , when the government covered up the epidemic until after it had spread throughout China and beyond . 
The momentum of this rising demand in China for &quot; rights &quot; can also be seen in the coverage of other major events in the traditional media . 
For example , when covering a natural disaster , a major industrial accident , or an urgent public health issue , journalists in the traditional media are not allowed to investigate and report without official sanction . 
Journalists now learn how to evade government guidelines by distributing and collecting information online , making it more difficult for propaganda bosses to silence the spread of information considered &quot; sensitive . &quot; 
Ordinary internet users can also write about events they witness and broadcast their reports online , making the suppression of important breaking news almost impossible . 
Moreover , the authorities have a difficult time tracking down and punishing people who spread this kind of &quot; subversive &quot; information - a term frequently used by the government to suppress political dissent - online . 
Because Chinese internet users are now more likely to find out about a breaking story in real time and question why the official press hasn &apos;t covered it , China &apos;s conventional media now feel pressure from the public to cover events that they might otherwise dodge . 
Online discussion of current events , especially through internet bulletin boards , is another new phenomenon . 
One recent survey shows that the number of users registered with China &apos;s ten most popular bulletin boards , which focus on news and political affairs , range from 100,000 to 500,000 . 
Mainly through bulletin boards , email mailing list services and an emerging &quot; Web log &quot; community , the internet has begun to provide an alternative public sphere that did not exist in China a few years ago . 
Under the state censorship system , most discussions are limited to politically acceptable topics , such as legal reform and anti-corruption efforts . 
However , within these boundaries , internet-enabled activism , such as online petitions , have not only expanded the boundaries of traditional media reporting , but presaged some interesting new political consequences as well . 
When college student Sun Zhigang was beaten to death by the police in the southern city of Guangzhou this spring , for example , it inspired a storm of online calls for &quot; weiquan , &quot; and provoked debates over the &quot; custody and repatriation system . &quot; 
That form of &quot; administrative detention , &quot; used primarily against migrant workers , was the basis for Sun &apos;s detention . 
The online protest that ensued undoubtedly played a role in the government &apos;s decision to abolish the system and arrest the officials involved in the case . 
Despite government efforts to control the internet , a space to support the rising rights consciousness within Chinese society has been carved out . 
As the pervasiveness and flexibility of the new medium weakens traditional media censorship , internet-enabled social activism plays an increasingly influential role in China &apos;s legal reform and the development of its nascent civil society . 
China &apos;s 70 million &quot; netizens &quot; may now be in a prime position to guide the transformation of society and determine the country &apos;s future . 
Ultimately , what happens may tell us as much about the inherent nature of the internet in our evolving world as about a changing China .
