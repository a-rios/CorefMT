The Diaspora Goldmine 
CAMBRIDGE - Many countries have substantial diasporas , but not many are proud of it . 
After all , people tend not to leave a country when it is doing well , so the diaspora is often a reminder of a country &apos;s darker moments . 
El Salvador , Nicaragua , and Cuba , to cite three examples , had more than 10 % of their native population living abroad in 2010 . 
And this figure does not take into account their descendants . 
The bulk of this migration happened at a time of civil war or revolution . 
In other places , massive outmigration occurred in the context of political change , as in Europe when communism collapsed . 
The relationship between diasporas and their homelands often encompasses a broad palette of sentiments , including distrust , resentment , envy , and enmity . 
Colloquially , people describe a bout of emigration as a period in which a country &quot; lost &quot; a certain proportion of its population . 
But people who leave a country have not disappeared . 
They are alive and socially active . 
As a result , they may become an invaluable asset not only to their country of destination but also , and importantly , to their country of origin . 
One important connection is remittances , which add up to some $ 500 billion a year worldwide . 
The largest recipients are India , Mexico , and the Philippines . 
For countries such as Armenia , El Salvador , Haiti , Honduras , Jamaica , Kyrgyzstan , Lesotho , Moldova , Nepal , and Tajikistan , expatriates remit the equivalent of more than one-sixth of national income - an amount that often exceeds exports . 
And this money can do a lot of good , as the World Bank &apos;s Dilip Ratha has highlighted . 
But a diaspora &apos;s potential economic importance goes well beyond remittances . 
As the late historian Philip Curtin documented , from the beginning of urban life , millennia ago , trade typically involved networks of co-ethnic merchants living among aliens . 
Greeks , Phoenicians , trans-Saharan traders , the Hanseatic League , Jews , Armenians , overseas Chinese , and the Dutch and British East India Companies organized much of world trade through such networks . 
Although these alien traders were sometimes politically powerful in the host countries , they were often weak and faced discrimination . 
The economist Avner Greif argues that these co-ethnic networks &quot; durability and resilience throughout history reflects their ability to enforce contracts at long distances when the existing institutional framework could not do so reliably . 
They could establish trust between exporters and importers because they could punish opportunistic behaviors . 
For a tight-knit community , reputational costs and other forms of social punishment transcend geography : not paying for goods might mean not being able to marry your children well . 
Legal institutions have since evolved to facilitate impersonal trade . 
Exporters and importers no longer need to know one another , because they can write a contract that a court will enforce . 
And yet the impact of co-ethnic networks may well be as important as ever . 
As Hillel Rapoport of the Paris School of Economics and his co-authors have shown , controlling for other determinants of trade , countries trade more with , and invest more in , the diasporas &quot; home countries . 
In recent work with Dany Bahar , Rapoport has also shown that countries become good at making the products that their migrants &quot; home countries are good at making . 
I interpret these results as the consequence of tacit knowledge or knowhow . 
To do things , you need to know how , and this knowhow is mostly unconscious . 
After all , most of us know how to ride a bicycle , but we are not really aware of what our brain does to achieve that feat , or how it develops that ability through practice . 
This knowhow moves geographically in the brains of those who possess it and is transferred to others at work . 
That is why ethnic cuisines diffuse through diasporas , not cookbooks . 
And it may be why economies with more diverse sets of migrants perform better . 
Also , return migration is often an important source of new skills for a country . 
In ongoing work , Ljubica Nedelkoska of Harvard &apos;s Center for International Development has found that the wages of Albanians who never left tend to increase when migrants return home . 
Evidence of the importance of diasporas is everywhere , if you care to look . 
Franschhoek ( French corner in Afrikaans ) is a beautiful valley near Cape Town settled by Huguenots in the late seventeenth century . 
That is why , to this day , wines are made there . 
Likewise , Joinville is a southern Brazilian city settled in the late nineteenth century by relatively uneducated Germans . 
Because of the cultural links they and their descendants have maintained with the mother country for more than 120 years , the city excels at advanced manufacturing of products that had not been invented when the migrants came . 
Morocco is full of French-language call centers that get their contracts through a cousin in Paris . 
East Asian industrialization exploited the links created by the network of overseas Chinese . 
India &apos;s high-tech industries were to a large extent created by returning migrants and are deeply connected to the diaspora . 
Israel is an entire country created by its diaspora , and its thriving high-tech sector , too , has benefited from sustained ties . 
By contrast , many Latin American countries have substantial diasporas abroad , but few equivalent success stories . 
A country &apos;s diaspora , and the diasporas it hosts , can be a huge asset for its development . 
Diasporas are not gusanos or worms , as Fidel Castro refers to Cubans abroad . 
They are a channel through which not only money , but also much tacit knowledge , can flow , and they are a potential source of opportunities for trade , investment , innovation , and professional networks . 
But a diaspora can work its economic magic only if the host country tolerates it and the home country appreciates it . 
Governments should have a diaspora strategy that builds on natural feelings of identity and affection to cultivate this social network as a powerful source of economic progress .
