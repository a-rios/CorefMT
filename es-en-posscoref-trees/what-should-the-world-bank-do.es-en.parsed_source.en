What Should the World Bank Do ? 
NEW YORK - I have been honored by World Bank directors representing developing countries and Russia to be selected as one of two developing-country candidates to become the Bank &apos;s next president . 
So I want to make known to the global community the principles that will guide my actions if I am elected - principles based on lessons learned from development experience . 
That experience has taught me that successful development is always the result of a judicious mix of market , state , and society . 
Trying to suppress markets leads to gross inefficiencies and loss of dynamism . 
Trying to do without the state leads to unstable and / or inequitable outcomes . 
And trying to ignore social actors that play an essential role at the national and local levels precludes the popular legitimacy that successful policymaking requires . 
Indeed , the specific mix of markets , state , and society should be the subject of national decisions adopted by representative authorities . 
This means that it is not the role of any international institution to impose a particular model of development on any country - a mistake that the World Bank made in the past , and that it has been working to correct . 
Because no &quot; one-size-fits-all &quot; strategy exists , the Bank must include among its staff the global diversity of approaches to development issues . 
Development is a comprehensive process that involves economic , social , and environmental dimensions - the three pillars of sustainable development . 
And , frankly , I have concerns about some of the World Bank &apos;s views and priorities in recent decades . 
For example , while the Bank has made important contributions to the nurturing of deep financial sectors , it still has much to learn about financial inclusiveness and the role that well designed development banks have played in fostering sustainable and inclusive growth in countries around the world . 
We should never forget , in this regard , that the World Bank is itself a global public-sector development institution . 
The Bank contributed significantly in its early decades to the development of high-quality physical infrastructure , a critical area that , unfortunately , was later marginalized . 
The return of this issue to the center of the Bank &apos;s focus is a welcome development . 
Above all , I believe that economic development should be viewed as a process of persistent structural change , which , if successful , supports constant technological upgrading of production and trade . 
This approach was central to the World Bank &apos;s activities up to the 1970 &quot; s , and , while it has been partly revived , it is still far from being incorporated into the Bank &apos;s operations . 
The goal of development is greater and more equitable human welfare . 
Human development is about much more than the generation of human capital : it is essentially about expanding the scope of human freedom . 
And that can be achieved only with universal education , health care , and social protection . 
Targeting can be a useful instrument of universal policies , but it can never serve as a substitute for them . 
Likewise , social protection goes beyond the narrow concept of the &quot; social safety net &quot; that has dominated debate in recent decades . 
The concept of the &quot; social protection floor , &quot; recently proposed by the Bachelet Report ( produced by the International Labor Organization under the leadership of former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet ) provides better intellectual grounding . 
Equity and inclusiveness require placing the advancement of the poor and other marginalized groups at the center of development specialists &quot; concern . 
In particular , gender equality deserves special attention , an approach that the World Bank today rightly characterizes as smart economics . 
Guaranteeing these objectives is not just about compensating for market outcomes and social forces that generate or reproduce inequalities . 
It is also about incorporating these objectives into economic policymaking , by placing the creation of fulfilling jobs and well-developed welfare institutions at the center of the economic agenda , and by respecting the role of cultural diversity in economic development . 
This approach also applies to the environmental pillar of development : intervention to counter damage generated by the economy is not enough . 
Environmental concerns must be fully assimilated into economic policymaking - that is , into the incentive structure that drives decisions . 
Only then can economic development be made compatible with the contributions that developing countries must make to mitigating climate change and preserving our planet &apos;s remaining natural forests and biological diversity . 
The World Bank &apos;s capacity to contribute to achieving these goals depends on it remaining a true global institution with a special responsibility vis-Ã -vis the world &apos;s poorest countries and a commitment to helping middle-income countries face their own challenges . 
It must count on the vision and contributions of more advanced nations , as well as those of emerging powers . 
And it must do so as part of the system of global governance , strengthening its cooperation with other multilateral organizations , in particular those in the United Nations system and regional and subregional development banks . 
These are the development principles and priorities for which I stand . 
If elected to head the world &apos;s leading development institution , I will work with all of its members to fulfill them .
