Insecure Europe 
MADRID - For the last five years , Europe has been shaken by financial and economic convulsions that have wreaked havoc on many of its citizens &quot; livelihoods . 
The good news is that progress is finally being made in redeveloping the European Union &apos;s economic and monetary architecture , which should help to bring about a return to growth . 
But EU leaders &quot; focus on internal problems has caused them largely to neglect external policies , particularly in the area of security . 
As 2014 begins , economic insecurity is giving way to worries about the EU &apos;s strategic position . 
There were expectations that the European Council &apos;s December meeting would signal a return to a more outward-looking approach , especially on security matters . 
Unfortunately , these hopes were quickly dashed . 
The flawed nature of the current European Security Strategy - drafted in 2003 , with a token revision in 2008 - reflects the circumstances surrounding its conception . 
The ESS was developed in the aftermath of the Iraq war , amid heated debate over a proposed European constitution , in a hasty and reactive process hijacked by those who sought to position Europe as a counterweight - or even a rival power - to the United States . 
Making matters worse , the geopolitical environment has changed fundamentally in the decade since the ESS was ratified , owing to economic rebalancing toward Asia , the upheavals in the Arab world , the revival of Russian assertiveness , and the rise of isolationist tendencies in the US . 
As a result , the ESS does not capture the reality of today &apos;s world - a fact that is obvious from its opening declaration that &quot; Europe has never been so prosperous . &quot; 
To be sure , the ESS &apos;s three basic tenets - development assistance , soft power , and effective multilateralism - remain important . 
But Europe &apos;s leaders must reconceive these concepts in light of today &apos;s challenges . 
In terms of development , Europe must move away from the idea that aid should be used to bolster trade linkages and acknowledge the importance of foreign investment . 
In fact , net private capital flows to developing countries now outweigh official development assistance by nearly ten to one worldwide . 
As the world &apos;s second-largest source of foreign direct investment , the EU wields considerable influence , with European investors bringing credibility to projects and regions , thereby serving to attract further investment . 
For example , Morocco &apos;s Ouarzazate Solar Power Plant and its Drinking Water Efficiency Program were launched with € 37 million ( $ 50.6 million ) from the EU &apos;s Neighborhood Investment Facility ; these projects subsequently gained additional funding totaling more than € 600 million . 
The ESS &apos;s emphasis on soft power is also in urgent need of reassessment . 
The upsurge of protest across the Arab world raised expectations among Europeans that these countries would , to some extent , emulate Western institutions , values , and norms . 
But , while that did not occur , European principles certainly have not lost their allure , as recent protests in Ukraine , triggered by President Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s decision to shun closer ties with Europe , have shown . 
Nonetheless , the ESS &apos;s soft-power vision should not be allowed to obscure the security challenges that Europe faces . 
With the rise of non-traditional threats , Europeans are increasingly overlooking classical security risks like inter-state warfare , believing that they are no longer relevant - a notion that is reflected in the ESS . 
But , as China &apos;s increasingly assertive stance in the South and East China Seas starkly demonstrates , this idea is not only wrong ; it can be very dangerous . 
This brings us to the ESS &apos;s third tenet : advancing &quot; the development of a stronger international society , well-functioning international institutions , and a rule-based international order . &quot; 
In this case , the problem comes down to a lack of commitment , with the EU choosing the convenience of informal and ad hoc groupings over the challenge of reforming key institutions like the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund , and the World Bank , which are essential for effective multilateralism . 
Indeed , the EU is among the leading actors in the current &quot; G &quot; fad , which has culminated most recently in the G-20 . 
And , despite being an embodiment of international law , the EU indulges in soft-law approaches , whether at the recent COP-19 climate-change meeting in Warsaw , or by supporting the &quot; Geneva agreement &quot; on Iran &apos;s nuclear program , which , it is now clear , is nothing more than two aspirational declarations linked by a press release . 
In developing its new security strategy , Europe must consider America &apos;s role as an essential component of the geopolitical environment , viewing the US not as a foil , but as a nuanced partner . 
Beyond NATO , which remains important even at a low ebb , the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership offers a potent opportunity to shape a rule-based international order . 
The shine may have come off the EU , but the gripping scenes from Kyiv &apos;s Maidan Square are a powerful reminder of the enduring appeal of Europe &apos;s core values . 
What the EU needs now is an updated external strategy that capitalizes on this allure to bolster its influence , security , and prosperity , thereby halting its slide toward irrelevance .
