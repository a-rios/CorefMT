China &apos;s Credit Overdose 
SHANGHAI - The days of double-digit economic growth in China are over . 
Indeed , the annual growth rate , which has been lingering at about 7.5 % since 2012 , is predicted to fall to 7 % this year - and is likely to go lower . 
This is China &apos;s &quot; new normal , &quot; characterized , according to China &apos;s leaders , by &quot; medium-to-high-speed &quot; ( instead of high-speed ) growth . 
But perhaps even this is optimistic . 
In the last two years , credit grew almost twice as fast as GDP , and total social financing grew even faster . 
Yet GDP growth slowed considerably - from an annual average of 10.2 % in 2002-2011 - suggesting that China may be moving closer to a medium-to-low-speed growth path . 
One possible explanation for the divergence between credit and GDP growth is that potential growth has already dropped to 7 % . 
But such a sharp decline in potential growth typically implies a powerful brake , in the form of an external shock or major internal adjustments . 
Under normal circumstances , an economy &apos;s potential growth rate adjusts naturally and gradually , as structural change progresses . 
In fact , there is no definitive evidence that China &apos;s potential growth rate has plunged . 
China weathered the 2008 global economic crisis better than other emerging economies . 
And , though structural factors , including an aging population and shrinking labor force , can certainly undermine potential growth , their effects are not sudden . 
So what explains the sharp decline in China &apos;s economic output , in an environment of rapid credit expansion ? 
The answer is simple : the way the credit is being used . 
Before the crisis , credit expansion in China kept pace with GDP growth . 
Since the end of 2008 , however , credit amounting to 35 % of GDP has been issued annually , causing the credit-to-GDP ratio to soar from less than 150 % before the crisis to 250 % today . 
That means that credit has become much less efficient . 
The problem stems from the CN ¥ 4 trillion ( $ 660 billion ) stimulus plan that the government launched in 2008 , which fueled the creation of about CN ¥ 14 trillion worth of credit - and supported a rapid increase in fixed-asset investment , especially in infrastructure and real-estate development . 
When , in late 2009 , the investment-intensive economy began to show signs of overheating , the government imposed strict macroeconomic controls , forcing investors to halt ongoing projects . 
Growth fell immediately . 
Meanwhile , debt continued to rise - not least because of the continued accumulation of interest . 
Indeed , according to the political economist Victor Shih , the interest that accrued to all debts in China in 2010 amounted to 80 % of incremental nominal GDP . 
In 2012 , the two figures were nearly equivalent , with interest rising to 140 % of incremental nominal GDP in 2013 and , Shih expects , to 200 % for 2014 . 
Local governments , in particular , have struggled with a colossal volume of bad debt , which has undermined their capacity for capital expenditure and frozen out private demand for productive investment . 
Stringent controls on the real-estate market placed a heavy burden on the developers themselves , as well as related industries like steel . 
Yet China &apos;s government failed to acknowledge - much less address - the bad debts in a timely manner , instead allowing them to grow even larger . 
Given that the only way to enable borrowers to avoid default - at least temporarily - has been to provide an ever-increasing amount of liquidity , even banks facing liquidity constraints have remained willing to extend new loans . 
Though China &apos;s high national savings rate means that it does not have to borrow liquidity from abroad or print large amounts of money , the risks it faces should not be underestimated . 
With such a large share of the new liquidity being used to cover debt service , there is little left to finance new , growth-stimulating investment . 
Moreover , as debts grow ever larger , banks &quot; willingness to lend will decline , driving debtors to the unregulated shadow-banking sector , where interest rates are extremely high , for their liquidity needs . 
The rising cost of financing will further undermine fixed-asset investment ( and thus economic growth ) . 
China &apos;s &quot; new normal &quot; is actually not normal at all . 
While the growth curve and structural changes in the East Asian economy from the 1960s to the 1990s suggest that China could experience medium-to-high growth rates for another decade , the country must address its debt problem first . 
The first step is to cut interest rates immediately , thereby reducing the burden on debtors and bolstering GDP growth . 
The government must also pursue a more active fiscal policy , rather than focusing on monetary policy . 
Furthermore , given that local governments and state-owned enterprises are responsible for the majority of China &apos;s bad debts , write-offs , funded by central-government bonds , will probably be necessary - and soon . 
Though the &quot; debt swap &quot; scheme that the finance ministry just introduced - which allows highly leveraged local governments to swap CN ¥ 1 trillion of debt maturing this year for bonds with lower interest rates - is a step in the right direction , it is far from adequate . 
With the central government enjoying such favorable fiscal conditions - its debt-to-GDP ratio stands at only about 20 % - now is the ideal time to initiate a much larger debt-swap program . 
Of course , curbing future debt accumulation is also vital to China &apos;s long-term prosperity . 
That is why China must reduce local governments &quot; dependence on banks to meet their financing needs , by nurturing bond and equity markets . 
The debt-induced distortions in China &apos;s economy today are precisely that - distortions . 
They are not a fundamental feature of the economy , and they need not characterize China &apos;s new normal . 
With the right strategy , the authorities can eliminate these distortions and allow the economy to reach its medium-to-high-speed growth potential over the next decade .
