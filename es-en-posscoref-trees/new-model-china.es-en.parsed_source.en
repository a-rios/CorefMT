New Model China 
China &apos;s leaders are gathered for their annual retreat at the seaside resort of Beidaihe . 
They , and the world at large , are focusing on the succession to President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji . 
What sort of China will Jiang &apos;s successors inherit ? 
Kenichi Ohmae offers his analysis . 
Over the coming decades , China will become a thoroughly new form of political and economic entity . 
Brutally competitive in both politics and world markets , innovative and resilient , China will be more dominant than any nation save America . 
Such a shift in the global balance of power occurs only about once every century and is comparable to the emergence of the US as a world power a century ago . 
The magnitude of this change is due , in part , to a radical and rapid shift in China &apos;s governance . 
Because of its suddenness , it is tempting to write this shift off as a fluke . 
But China &apos;s restructuring is permanent and will affect every aspect of its national life , as well as its global standing . 
The People &apos;s Republic now embodies two systems : the centralized , autocratic Communist administration , dominated by an outdated ideology and military interests , and the decentralized free-market economic regime . 
Whether deliberately or not , China is reorganizing itself to balance central authority and common purpose with decentralized freedom , in the same way that nimble companies balance home-office and divisional control . 
The result is an entirely new geopolitical model - the country as corporation . 
Call the new China &quot; Chung-hua , Inc . &quot; 
( Chunghua translates as &quot; China &quot; and actually means &quot; the prosperous center of the universe . &quot; ) 
Like many corporations , China is moving most decisionmaking to the &quot; business unit &quot; level - semi-autonomous , self-governing economic region-states that compete fiercely against each other for capital , technology , and human resources ( just as America &apos;s states do ) . 
This new , decentralized free-market regime currently encompasses only a small part of China &apos;s vast territory , and many Chinese officials still refuse to acknowledge its existence . 
Indeed , only seven years ago , the word federation was banned from the Chinese language ; companies like Federal Transport or Federation Merchants were required to change their names . 
Today , China has the most federal governance structure of any large nation except the US . 
Two broad categories of region-states exist . 
The first are relatively small , composed of cities and their surrounding areas , generally with a population of 5-7 million people . 
Some of these - Shenzhen , Shanghai , Dalian , Tianjin , Shenyang , Xiamen , Qingdao , and Suzhou - are now growing economically at a rate of 15-20 % per year - faster than such Asian &quot; tigers &quot; as Malaysia , Taiwan , Thailand , and Korea ever did . 
These smaller region-states , in turn , are propelling the growth of larger mega-regions , with populations approaching 100 million each . 
The mega-regions , which tend to share common dialects , ethnic identities , and histories , are becoming economic powerhouses in their own right . 
If they were separate nations , five of them - the Yangtze Delta , the Northeastern Tristates area ( formerly known as Manchuria ) , the Pearl River Delta , the Beijing-Tianjin corridor , and Shandong - would rank among Asia &apos;s ten largest economies . 
Regional governments have also been toughened up by the Chung-hua , Inc. ethic . 
Most officials are appointed , not elected , but their posts are not sinecures . 
Not only are they held to targets of 7 % annual economic growth or better ( like many corporate executives ) , they must also improve environmental quality , build better infrastructure , and reduce local crime levels . 
In October 2001 , a half-dozen bureaucrats were expelled from one of China &apos;s major cities for not meeting their economic growth and security targets . 
Local officials are often considered heroes , not oppressors . 
In January 2001 , Bo Xhi Lai , then mayor of Dalian , was promoted to governor of Liaoning province . 
Thousands of women , many in tears , spontaneously came to a park to bid him farewell . 
During his nine-year tenure , Dalian evolved from a ramshackle port into one of the cleanest and most prosperous cities in Asia . 
It now has a street life more vibrant than Singapore , a layout reminiscent of Paris before the automobile , and a reputation among Japanese tourists for high-quality hotels , transportation , and restaurants . 
All of this is taking place in a nation where Communist ideology remains strong and that remains in many respects a military dictatorship which threatens to conquer Taiwan by force , as well as uses North Korea , Pakistan , and Libya as stalking horses for weapons development . 
Introduction of foreign companies , technologies , and unfettered mobility for corporations and people would all be viewed as a threat to the Communist system if it were publicly acknowledged . 
Instead , China &apos;s highest officials publicly insist that they run the most centrally controlled government in the world , with full authority to appoint or dismiss mayors , governments , and bureaucrats . 
Strictly speaking , they are right . 
So debates about China should not be cast as a simple matter of right or wrong , but of when and how . 
Politically , China is comparable to the US in 1800 : an emerging nation with high ideals but widespread poverty and many practices that others find intolerable . 
A decade or two of economic freedom and growth will give China &apos;s people an appetite for self-determination and participation that may surprise the rest of us . 
Already , some village leaders are elected ; this may slowly spread to regional officials , and then upward to the central government . 
Even top communists appear to acknowledge and embrace change . 
Recently , China &apos;s head of state , Jiang Zemin , said that the Communist Party &quot; represents &quot; every good aspect of China , including wealthy capitalists , not just the poor , the exploited , and the proletariat . 
We should not be surprised if soon - perhaps at the Party &apos;s 2002 General Assembly - China &apos;s leaders formally call for a new doctrine to match its new model .
