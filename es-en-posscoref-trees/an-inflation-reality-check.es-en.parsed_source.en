An Inflation Reality Check 
CAMBRIDGE - As inflation continues to soar everywhere , maybe the world &apos;s central bankers need a jolt to awaken them from complacency . 
How about holding one of their bi-monthly meetings in hyperinflationary Zimbabwe ? 
It might not be comfortable , but it would be educational . 
According to Zimbabwe &apos;s official statistical agency , inflation topped 66,000 % in 2007 , which looks more like Weimar Germany than modern-day Africa . 
While no one is quite certain how the government managed to estimate prices , given that there is virtually nothing for sale in the shops , most indicators suggest that Zimbabwe does have a good shot at breaking world records for inflation . 
Of course , curious as they might be , central bankers could decide that meeting in Harare would be too inconvenient and politically unpalatable . 
Fortunately , there are lots of other nice - albeit less spectacular - inflation destinations . 
Inflation in Russia , Vietnam , Argentina , and Venezuela is solidly in double digits , to name just a few possibilities . 
Indeed , except for deflation-ridden Japan , central bankers could meet just about anywhere and see high and rising inflation . 
Chinese authorities are so worried by their country &apos;s 7 % inflation they are copying India and imposing price controls on food . 
Even the United States had inflation at 4 % last year , though the Federal Reserve is somehow convinced that most people won &apos;t notice . 
Many central bankers and economists argue that today &apos;s rising global inflation is just a temporary aberration , driven by soaring prices for food , fuel , and other commodities . 
True , prices for many key commodities are up 25 % to 50 % since the start of the year . 
But if central bankers think that today &apos;s inflation is simply the product of short-term resource scarcities as opposed to lax monetary policy , they are mistaken . 
The fact is that around most of the world , inflation - and eventually inflation expectations - will keep climbing unless central banks start tightening their monetary policies . 
The US is now ground zero for global inflation . 
Faced with a vicious combination of collapsing housing prices and imploding credit markets , the Fed has been aggressively cutting interest rates to try to stave off a recession . 
But even if the Fed does not admit it in its forecasts , the price of this &quot; insurance policy &quot; will almost certainly be higher inflation down the road , and perhaps for several years . 
America &apos;s inflation would be contained but for the fact that so many countries , from the Middle East to Asia , effectively tie their currencies to the dollar . 
Others , such as Russia and Argentina , do not literally peg to the dollar but nevertheless try to smooth movements . 
As a result , whenever the Fed cuts interest rates , it puts pressure on the whole &quot; dollar bloc &quot; to follow suit , lest their currencies appreciate as investors seek higher yields . 
Looser US monetary policy has thus set the tempo for inflation in a significant chunk - perhaps as much as 60 % - of the global economy . 
But , with most economies in the Middle East and Asia in much stronger shape than the US and inflation already climbing sharply in most emerging-market countries , aggressive monetary stimulus is the last thing they need right now . 
The European Central Bank is staying calm for the moment , but it , too , is probably holding back on interest-rate hikes partly out of fear of driving the euro , already at record levels , even higher . 
And the ECB worries that if the US recession proves contagious , it may have to turn around and start slashing rates anyway . 
So what happens next ? 
If the US tips from mild recession into deep recession , the global deflationary implications will cancel out some of the inflationary pressures the world is facing . 
Global commodity prices will collapse , and prices for many goods and services will stop rising so quickly as unemployment and excess capacity grow . 
Of course , a US recession will also bring further Fed interest-rate cuts , which will exacerbate problems later . 
But inflation pressures will be even worse if the US recession remains mild and global growth remains solid . 
In that case , inflation could easily rise to 1980 &quot; s ( if not quite 1970 &quot; s ) levels throughout much of the world . 
Until now , most investors have thought that they would rather risk high inflation for a couple of years than accept even a short and shallow recession . 
But they too easily forget the costs of high inflation , and how difficult it is to squeeze it out of the system . 
Maybe they , too , should try holding a few conferences in Zimbabwe , and get a reality check of their own .
