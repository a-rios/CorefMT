Ambivalent Arabia 
A democratic tide seems to be sweeping across the Arab world . 
Even the traditional Arab monarchies and Emirates are changing in its wake . 
Kuwait now allows women to vote , Qatar has embraced an ambitious reform program , Bahrain has shown great tolerance of mass demonstrations , and the U.A.E. is allowing something like a free press . 
But Saudi Arabia continues to be deeply wary of any sort of change , and thus remains a huge and seemingly immovable obstacle to region-wide reform . 
Although the Saudi ruling family , the al-Saud , is under enormous pressure to follow the example of its neighbors , internal resistance to doing so remains very strong . 
So the al-Saud have become Janus-faced : looking in one direction , the royal family encourages democratic reformers to speak out ; looking in the opposite direction , it jails them when they do . 
On May 15 , in a closed trial without legal representation for the accused , three leading reformers - Ali Al Dumaini , a well-known journalist and poet , and university professors Abdullah Al Hamid and Matruk al Falih - were condemned and sentenced to prison terms ranging from six to nine years . 
Their crime was to call for a constitutional monarchy . 
The official verdict states that they threatened national unity , challenged those in authority , and incited public opinion against the state while using &quot; foreign , &quot; that is , Western , terminology . 
Not long after the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States , these liberal reformers joined with 160 other professionals to write and sign a petition to Crown Prince Abdullah asking for reforms . 
The petition called for the monarchy to work within constitutionally prescribed limits , and for an independent judiciary . 
The reformers believe that such reforms are the only way for Saudi Arabia to survive the threat of violence , instability , and national fragmentation that is looming on its horizon . 
Only a constitution , they argue , can restore much needed legitimacy to a political system that is widely perceived as deeply corrupt and inept . 
Crown Prince Abdullah , Saudi Arabia &apos;s de facto ruler in place of his incapacitated half-brother King Fahd , is keen to be seen as a champion of reform . 
He received these proposals with a warm welcome in January 2003 . 
But his half-brother and more powerful rival , Prince Naif , the Minister of Interior , ordered the arrests , trial , and imprisonment of 13 reformers in March 2004 . 
Crown Prince Abdullah offered not a peep of opposition , leaving the reform agenda that he initiated in a political netherworld . 
In order to maintain absolutist power and to minimize public anger , the Saudi princes , led by Prince Naif , asked the reformers to sign an agreement that they would never again ask for reform . 
Prince Naif bans the very word &quot; reform &quot; from public discourse , because it suggests that there is something wrong with the system ; his preferred term is &quot; development . &quot; 
Of the thirteen reformers who were arrested , ten submitted to this demand , but the other three refused and have paid the price . 
They remained in jail in Riyadh without legal representation until the final verdict . 
Those who submitted had their passports withdrawn , lost their jobs , and were forbidden to speak to the press . 
Under regional and international pressure , the Saudi ruling family has constructed a Potemkin village of reform while retaining absolute control over all political developments . 
Earlier this year , they staged partial , and tightly regulated municipal elections , with no independent opinion permitted to influence when and how the ballots were held . 
These entire female population was excluded , and only one-quarter of the male population was eligible to vote . 
Inevitably , Wahhabi Islamists did best . 
The al-Saud face two threats : one from violent Islamists , and the other from liberal reformers . 
There is every indication that they fear the reformers far more . 
Perhaps the princes believe that it is easier to kill &quot; terrorist &quot; criminals than to crush demands for social justice . 
Indeed , killing violent Islamists and al-Qaeda affiliates is applauded by the international community , especially the United States , as success in the &quot; war on terrorism . &quot; 
But as they hunt down and kill violent domestic extremists , they are quietly tightening the noose around all those who want moderate reform . 
This repression of liberal reformers passes unnoticed in the wider world , with America &apos;s silence particularly noticeable . 
This silence is vital to the princes , for what the al-Saud care about most is US support . 
As things stand in Saudi Arabia , the US administration has no credible ally for change outside of the existing regime . 
So , unlike in Ukraine , Georgia , Kyrgizstan , and Lebanon , it does nothing to encourage popular opposition . 
As long as the Saudi regime meets America &apos;s oil needs and fights Islamist radicals , it will continue to receive US support and silence - and hence its tacit consent . 
But turning a blind eye is shortsighted , for America and for the Saudis . 
Those who make peaceful revolutions impossible make violent revolutions inevitable . 
The liberal reformers who have been jailed could have paved the way for a peaceful transition to a reformed Saudi Arabia . 
By jailing them , the regime has made it clear that violence is the only avenue open to those seeking change .
