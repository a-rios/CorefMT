Khrushchev &apos;s Secret Speech and End of Communism 
In history , some events at first appear insignificant , or their significance is hidden , but they turn out to be earthshaking . 
Such a moment occurred 50 years ago , with Nikita Khrushchev &apos;s so-called &quot; Secret Speech &quot; to the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . 
It ranks , I believe , just below the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the start of Hitler &apos;s War in 1939 as the most critical moment of the twentieth century . 
At that moment , the communist movement appeared to be riding the tide of history , and not only for those in the Soviet Union . 
In the mid-1950 &quot; s , communism was on the offensive in Europe , as well as in the emerging Third World . 
Capitalism seemed to be dying . 
All of communism &apos;s imperfections were deemed temporary , just bumps on the way to the just society that was then being born . 
A third of humanity saw the Soviet Union as leading the world toward global socialism . 
The Twentieth Congress put an end to that . 
It was a moment of truth , a cleansing from within of the brutality of Stalinism . 
Khrushchev &apos;s speech to the Congress inspired doubt and second thoughts throughout the worldwide Communist movement . 
Khrushchev &apos;s motives as he took the podium on the morning of February 25 , 1956 , were , in his mind , moral ones . 
After his ouster from power , in the seclusion of his dacha , he wrote : &quot; My hands are covered with blood . 
I did everything that others did . 
But even today if I have to go to that podium to report on Stalin , I would do it again . 
One day all that had to be over . &quot; 
Khrushchev had , of course , been an intimate part of Stalin &apos;s repressions , but he also didn &apos;t know half of what was going on . 
The whole Stalinist system of government was built on absolute secrecy , in which only the General Secretary himself knew the whole story . 
It wasn &apos;t terror that was the basis of Stalin &apos;s power , but his complete monopoly on information . 
Khrushchev , for example , was stunned when he discovered that in the 1930 &quot; s and 1940 &quot; s , some 70 % of Party members were annihilated . 
Initially , Khrushchev didn &apos;t plan to keep his denunciation of Stalin a secret . 
Five days after the Congress , his speech was sent to all the leaders of the socialist countries and read at local party meetings across the Soviet Union . 
But people didn &apos;t know how to discuss it . 
And with good reason , for the problem with the de-Stalinization process was that , although the truth was partly revealed , no answer regarding what to do next was offered . 
After the Congress , it became clear that the communist gospel was false and murderously corrupt . 
But no other ideology was offered , and the crisis - the slow rot of the system that became clear during the era of stagnation under Leonid Brezhnev - that began with Khrushchev &apos;s speech lasted another 30 years , until Mikhail Gorbachev took up his mantle of change . 
The doubts inspired at the Congress may have been inchoate , but they nonetheless sowed genuine unrest . 
In the first of the protests that rocked the communist world in 1956 , huge crowds in Georgia demanded that Khrushchev be fired and Stalin &apos;s memory reinstated . 
An uprising in Poland and the far more tumultuous Hungarian Revolution argued for the opposite . 
The Poles demanded communism with a human face , and the Hungarians , after Imre Nagy sought to reform communism , ended up wanting no communism at all . 
All of these protests were brutally crushed , which resulted in many West European Communists leaving the Party in utter disillusion . 
Khrushchev &apos;s speech also ignited the feud between Mao &apos;s China and the USSR , for it allowed Mao to claim the crown of world revolutionary leadership . 
Worried by the protests , Khrushchev tried to cool off the anti-Stalin campaign . 
The release of the Gulag prisoners that followed his speech continued , but it was done in silence . 
Party membership was restored to purge survivors , and they received new jobs , but they were forbidden from discussing the horrors that they had endured . 
That silence lasted until 1961 , when Khrushchev permitted new revelations of Stalin-era crimes . 
These were publicly reported and discussed on TV and radio . 
Stalin &apos;s body was removed from Red Square , Stalin monuments were destroyed , and cities restored their original Soviet names . 
Stalingrad became Volgograd . 
The idea of the Gulag entered our literature with Alexander Solzhenitsyn &apos;s One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich . 
This second anti-Stalinist campaign lasted two years , which was not nearly enough to change the country &apos;s mentality . 
The Twentieth Congress shattered the world Communist movement , and it turned out to be impossible to cement the cracks . 
The Soviet Union and other socialist countries faced a crisis of faith , as the main threat to communism was not imperialism , or ideological dissidents , but the movement &apos;s own intellectual poverty and disillusion . 
So , although it is common today in Russia to blame Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin for the collapse of the USSR , it is both useless and unfair to do so . 
The system was dead already , and it is to Yeltsin &apos;s great credit that he was able to bring Russia out of the ruins in one piece . 
Although Russia &apos;s future is uncertain , its history is becoming clearer , in part because we now know that the Twentieth Party Congress started the process that brought about the end of Soviet despotism .
