China &apos;s Trilemma 
BEIJING - The Nobel laureate economist Robert Mundell showed that an economy can maintain two - but only two - of three key features : monetary-policy independence , a fixed exchange rate , and free cross-border capital flows . 
At first glance , this may not seem to be the case . 
Given that the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) has largely maintained its monetary-policy independence over the last three decades , and actively manages the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate , it is natural to conclude that China imposes strict controls on capital flows . 
In fact , China liberalized inward foreign direct investment more than 20 years ago , and eased controls for much of the capital account thereafter . 
China &apos;s efforts to regulate cross-border capital flows have never been very effective . 
During the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s , China had to implement draconian measures to prevent capital flight . 
In the early 2000s , short-term capital began to flow into China , with investors betting on the renminbi &apos;s appreciation and , from 2004-2006 , on rising asset prices . 
Since renminbi internationalization was launched in 2009 , exchange-rate arbitrage and the carry trade have surged . 
Certainly , China &apos;s capital controls , though porous , increase the transaction costs of moving short-term capital to and from China , thereby reducing upward pressure on the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate ; in extreme circumstances , this could play a decisive role in China &apos;s financial security . 
This raises an obvious question : How has China managed to defy the Mundell trilemma by maintaining all three policy objectives simultaneously ? 
The answer lies in China &apos;s sterilization policy . 
China has run a capital-account surplus for most of the last 30 years , and a trade surplus every year since 1993 . 
The PBOC keeps the exchange rate stable by intervening heavily in the foreign-exchange market , creating so much liquidity that the authorities must engage in massive sterilization to avoid overshooting the targeted increase in the monetary base . 
In China , unlike in advanced countries , monetary and sterilization policy are often one in the same . 
The degree to which monetary policy is expansionary depends on the degree to which the liquidity created by currency-market intervention has been sterilized . 
The most frequently used monetary instrument in sterilization is open-market operations . 
Given China &apos;s twin surpluses , the PBOC sold all of the government bonds that it had accumulated in 2003 , so it has been selling central-bank bills ever since , with CN Â¥ 5 trillion ( $ 812 billion ) in such bills currently held by banks . 
Another important instrument for sterilization is the reserve-requirement ratio , which , when raised , locks a large amount of liquidity in the banking system . 
The ratio , which the PBOC has changed 42 times since 1998 , currently stands at 20 % - double the ratio for large banks in the United States . 
Whatever the mechanism , the costs of sterilization are very high . 
For starters , by maintaining an undervalued real exchange rate , China has fallen into the so-called &quot; dollar trap , &quot; boosting the US dollar &apos;s international importance at China &apos;s own expense . 
As time passes , the senselessness of this policy will become increasingly apparent . 
Sterilization also leads to a serious misallocation of resources , most obviously by functioning as a subsidy to the export sector , at the expense of the rest of the economy . 
A less noticed form of resource misallocation stems from the fact that only sellers of foreign exchange gain liquidity , but the whole economy feels the effects . 
As a result , small and medium-size enterprises that produce non-tradable products are denied much-needed funds and suffer from sterilization &apos;s negative externalities . 
Furthermore , the high reserve ratio and forced purchase of central-bank bills squeezes commercial banks &quot; profits severely - a phenomenon that will be intensified by interest-rate liberalization . 
The quest for yield on available funds will drive banks to make riskier investments . 
There are also quasi-fiscal costs involved . 
Fortunately , despite the low returns on foreign assets , this is not yet a major problem for China , owing to the low costs of the corresponding PBOC liabilities . 
Nonetheless , though predictions that China would abandon its exchange-rate controls in order to uphold monetary autonomy have proved wrong over the last decade , this time may be different . 
With China &apos;s liberalization of interest rates and short-term capital flows making it increasingly difficult for the country to juggle Mundell &apos;s &quot; irreconcilable trinity , &quot; one hopes that Chinese leaders will finally allow the renminbi to float , while keeping in place existing capital controls .
