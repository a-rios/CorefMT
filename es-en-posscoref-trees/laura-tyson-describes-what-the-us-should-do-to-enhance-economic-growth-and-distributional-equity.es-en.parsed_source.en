Which Policies Reduce Income Inequality ? 
BERKELEY - US President Barack Obama recently declared that growing income inequality and the inequality of opportunity that it creates are the defining challenges now facing America . 
These problems have risen to the top of the political agenda in the United States , but they are not uniquely American problems . 
Income inequality began to widen in the US in the late 1970 &quot; s , and the trend spread to Europe by the late 1980 &quot; s , affecting even countries with long egalitarian traditions by the start of the new century . 
On the eve of the Great Recession of 2008-2009 , income inequality had reached all-time highs in the US and most developed countries . 
The recession and the painfully slow recovery have caused conditions everywhere to worsen , especially for children and young people entering the labor market . 
The fact that widening income inequality is a common feature of developed economies suggests common causes which are still not well understood . 
It is widely believed that America &apos;s income distribution is the most unequal among developed economies ; but reality is more complicated . 
Income can be measured in two ways : market income before taxes and transfer payments , and disposable income after taxes and transfer payments . 
Surprisingly , inequality of market income before taxes and transfer payments in the US is similar to that in many other developed countries , including those with egalitarian reputations like Sweden and Norway . 
Britain and even Germany have higher inequality of income before taxes and transfers than the US . 
Among developed countries , the US does have the most unequal distribution of disposable income after taxes and transfer payments . 
That is not because the US has the least progressive tax system ; indeed , its tax system is considerably more progressive than those of most European countries , Canada , and Australia , all of which rely on regressive value-added taxes as an important source of revenue . 
But , among developed countries , the US has the least generous and progressive transfer system . 
The US spends a much smaller share of GDP on family-assistance programs - including cash transfers , tax breaks , and direct government services - than its developed-country counterparts , where reliance on regressive consumption taxes to fund progressive transfer programs has kept income inequality significantly lower . 
Over the last 30 years , US economic policy aggravated rather than ameliorated income inequality . 
Both taxes and transfers became less progressive as market-income inequality widened . 
Indeed , according to a recent study , the decline in tax and transfer progressivity accounts for about 30 % of the growth in post-tax-and-transfer income inequality in the US during this period . 
The US needs a more progressive and redistributive tax and transfer system to combat rising inequality in market incomes . 
But this is unlikely , at least in the near term . 
Republicans are implacably opposed to increases in social-welfare programs and higher taxes on the wealthy to finance them . 
And there is bipartisan opposition to a value-added tax , with Democrats fearing its regressive consequences and Republicans dreading its revenue-generating effectiveness . 
To combat market-income inequality , the US also needs faster economic growth to boost the pace of job creation and reduce unemployment . 
The economy has been growing at less than half the rate that it did in previous recoveries , and the labor market has improved at an agonizingly slow pace . 
Indeed , the unemployment rate , at 7 % , remains elevated , despite a record-low labor-force participation rate . 
About four million workers have dropped out of the labor force since the Great Recession began . 
Roughly eight million are working part-time , because they cannot find a full-time position . 
Prolonged labor-market slack means falling real wages for most workers , with the negative effect growing as one moves down the wage distribution . 
The result is greater market-income inequality . 
From 2007 to 2012 , US real hourly wages fell for 70 % of the wage distribution , with larger losses for those holding lower-wage jobs . 
By contrast , real wages increased , albeit at a much slower pace than before the recession , for those in the top 30 % of the wage distribution . 
In his inequality speech , Obama reiterated several proposals to accelerate growth : increasing exports , reforming the corporate tax code , and investing more in infrastructure , R &amp; D , and education . 
These proposals are both growth-enhancing and equity-enhancing . 
Yet Congressional approval is unlikely , and overall fiscal policy remains strongly contractionary , reducing growth by about 1.5 percentage points this year . 
Obama also called for an increase in the minimum wage to combat income inequality . 
Here , prospects for Congressional approval look more promising , owing to strong voter support , with surveys showing that large majorities of Democratic , independent , and Republican voters support an increase . 
Adjusted for inflation , today &apos;s federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 per hour is 23 % lower than it was in 1968 . 
If it had kept up with inflation and with average productivity growth , it would be $ 25 per hour . 
At the current minimum wage , a worker employed full-time for a full year earns only $ 15,080 - 19 % below the poverty line for a family of three . 
According to the OECD , the US has the second-highest relative poverty rate ( the share of the population that earns less than half of the national median income ) among developed countries . 
Recent research suggests that an increase in the minimum wage would have a powerful positive effect , with a 10 % increase cutting the poverty rate by 2 % . 
Indeed , about 30 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour , as proposed by Congressional Democrats . 
Of these , 88 % would be at least 20 years old ( with an average age of 35 ) ; 55 % would be working full-time ; 56 % would be female , and more than 28 % would be parents . 
Putting more income into their hands would not only reduce poverty ; it would stimulate consumer spending at a time when inadequate demand continues to impede recovery and job creation . 
President Obama has made significant progress combating income inequality . 
Under his leadership , the federal income tax system has become more progressive , and Obamacare is the most progressive social-insurance program since Medicare and Medicaid began in 1965 . 
But there is far more to do . 
Raising the minimum wage is the right next step .
