Why Do Economies Stop Growing ? 
MILAN - Over the years , advanced and developing countries have experimented , sometimes deliberately and frequently inadvertently , with a variety of approaches to growth . 
Unfortunately , many of these strategies have turned out to have built-in limitations or decelerators - what one might call elements of unsustainability . 
And avoiding serious damage and difficult recoveries requires us to get a lot better at recognizing these self-limiting growth patterns early on . 
Here are some of the items in a growing library of decelerating growth models . 
In developing countries , import substitution as a way to jump-start economic diversification can work for a while ; but , over time , as productivity growth lags and comparative advantage is over-ridden , growth grinds to a halt . 
Small , open economies are naturally somewhat specialized , which leaves them vulnerable to shocks and volatility . 
But , in terms of growth and living standards , the cost of economic diversification , when implemented by protecting domestic industries from foreign competition , eventually outweighs the benefits . 
It is better to allow specialization , and build effective social safety nets and support systems to protect people and families during economic transitions . 
Such &quot; structural flexibility &quot; is better adapted to enabling the broad changes that rapidly evolving technological and global economic forces require . 
Mismanagement of natural-resource wealth underpins an especially potent self-limiting pattern of growth and development . 
If invested in infrastructure , education , and external financial assets , natural-resource revenues can accelerate growth . 
But , too often , such revenues distort economic incentives , which come to favor rent-seeking and interfere with the diversification that is essential for growth . 
More recently , many advanced countries have discovered a &quot; new &quot; set of growth models with built-in structural limitations : excessive private or public consumption , or both , usually accompanied and enabled by rising debt and inflated asset prices , and a corresponding decline in investment . 
This approach appears to work until domestic aggregate demand can no longer sustain growth and employment , at which point it ends in either gradual stagnation or a violent financial and economic crisis . 
( In fact , many developing countries have learned this the hard way , but the lessons seem not to have crossed over to advanced countries . ) 
But the opposite of the excessive-consumption model - excessive reliance on investment to generate aggregate demand - is also a self-limiting growth pattern . 
When the private and social returns of investment diminish too much , growth cannot be sustained indefinitely , even though rising investment rates can sustain aggregate demand for a while . 
Altering this growth pattern is a significant part of the challenge that China now faces . 
Rising inequality in either opportunity or outcomes ( and often both ) also poses threats to the sustainability of growth patterns . 
While people in a wide range of countries accept some degree of market-determined income variation , based on differential talents and personal preferences , there are limits . 
Perhaps the largest long-run sustainability issue concerns the adequacy of the global economy &apos;s natural-resource base : output will more than triple over the coming two or three decades , as high-growth developing economies &quot; four billion people converge toward advanced-country income levels and consumption patterns . 
Existing economic-development strategies will require significant adaption to accommodate this kind of growth . 
Some adaptation will occur naturally , as rising energy and other commodity prices generate incentives to economize or seek alternatives . 
But the un-priced environmental externalities - global warming and water depletion , for example - will require serious attention , not myopic , reactive mindsets and approaches . 
All of these self-limiting growth patterns tend to have three things in common . 
First , in one or several dimensions , some part of the economy &apos;s base of tangible , intangible , and natural-resource assets is being run down . 
I would include social cohesion as part of the asset base : it is the one that is depreciated by excessive inequality . 
Measurement issues play an important role here . 
It is easier to run down something that is partly invisible because it is not regularly or effectively measured . 
Expanded measurement of the dimensions of economic , social , and environmental performance is necessary to broaden awareness of sustainability issues . 
Second , unidentified self-limiting growth patterns produce very bad results . 
After all , past investment shortfalls have to be made up and future-oriented investments undertaken simultaneously - a double burden that must be borne by the current generation . 
An inability to resolve the distributional and fairness problem can produce gridlock , paralysis , and prolonged stagnation . 
Finally , many of these flawed growth patterns involve fiscal distress . 
Contrary to the prevailing wisdom nowadays , some degree of Keynesian demand management in the transition to a more sustainable growth pattern is not in conflict with restoring fiscal balance over a sensible time period . 
On the contrary , applied both individually and together , fiscal stimulus and consolidation are necessary parts of the adjustment process . 
But they are not sufficient . 
The crucial missing pieces are a shift in the structure of accessible aggregate demand and restoration of those parts of the economy &apos;s asset base that have been run down , implying the need for structural change and investment .
