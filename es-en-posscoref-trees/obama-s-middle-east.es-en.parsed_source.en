Obama &apos;s Middle East 
JERUSALEM - President-elect Barack Obama &apos;s plans for the Middle East , the region where his predecessor &apos;s policies shattered America &apos;s standing around the world as a benign superpower , represent a welcome departure from President Bush &apos;s grand design to redress the region &apos;s ills through &quot; constructive chaos . &quot; 
Unfortunately , Obama &apos;s all-encompassing promises might prove to be just as unrealistic . 
Obama &apos;s agenda is breathtaking . 
It includes extrication from the Iraqi morass and lifting its burden from America &apos;s foreign policy , resolving the festering Israeli-Palestinian conflict while confronting the &quot; hawkish &quot; Israel lobby , using dialogue to curb Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions and wean Syria from its radical agenda - thereby dissolving the region &apos;s &quot; axis of evil &quot; ( Iran-Syria-Hezbollah-Hamas ) - freeing Lebanon from Syria &apos;s grip , and pushing for an Israel-Syria peace . 
And you can add to this a reorientation of America &apos;s military effort to the war in Afghanistan . 
The magnitude of this agenda must be seen against the region &apos;s depressing legacy . 
This is the case in Lebanon with Hezbollah , in Palestine with Hamas , in Iraq with Moqtada al-Sadr &apos;s Mahdi Army and scores of other groups , with the Taliban and tribal warlords in Afghanistan , and with breakaway movements in Pakistan that have been emboldened by Pervez Musharaf &apos;s resignation . 
The looming end of President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s long rule in Egypt might lead to the emergence of a formidable bid by the Muslim Brotherhood for power in Cairo , possibly forcing Mubarak &apos;s successor either to reach a modus vivendi or to wage a fight to the death . 
Obama may soon learn that his timetable for withdrawal from Iraq is unrealistic . 
A rapid American disengagement might ultimately cause the country &apos;s disintegration into fragmented political entities , one of which would likely be an Iran-controlled Islamic republic . 
The resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan requires a more robust military response , but with the American army bogged down in Iraq and the Western allies reluctant to send additional troops , the country &apos;s dismemberment by local warlords is not a far-fetched scenario . 
And , with the allies &quot; military operations eroding President Hamid Karzai &apos;s domestic legitimacy , Obama might consider the advice of French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner , who warns that the answer in Afghanistan will have to be more political than military . 
As for Iran , Obama might have to fall back on a strategy of military pressure sooner than he would like . 
As the protracted dialogue conducted by the European Union &apos;s special representative , Javier Solana , on behalf of the Security Council &apos;s permanent members and Germany has proved , Iran has no intention of deviating from its drive to nuclear status . 
Unless Obama reaches an uneasy understanding with Russia - which would require revising post-Cold War strategic agreements - the chances of imposing a tight sanctions regime on Iran are slim . 
The specter of a Middle East nuclear arms race , with Iran &apos;s Sunni rivals in the region - Saudi Arabia , Egypt and others - redoubling their efforts to attain nuclear status , cannot be ruled out . 
In the Middle East , Obama faces an almost impossible task of redressing historical and political ills . 
Meanwhile , he inherits an America that is no longer an undisputed hegemony , and that , together with its allies , is immersed in the most severe economic crisis since 1929 . 
Struggling with a crisis that is shaking the foundations of capitalism and the American way of life , and laden with a $ 10 trillion national debt and a $ 1 trillion budget deficit , the United States is bound to opt for a realistic foreign policy , one that departs from the haughty disregard for history , tradition , and religion that characterized the Bush administration . 
Obama &apos;s ascension to the US presidency represents a revolutionary landmark in America &apos;s history that should not be allowed to fall victim to inflated expectations . 
His idealism needs to be tempered by the limits of American power . 
The challenge of his foreign policy is not to change the Middle East - this is the long-term task of the region &apos;s peoples - but to redress America &apos;s damaged reputation in the Muslim world . 
To achieve this objective requires resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict , particularly the Palestinian question . 
This is the real wound that infects America &apos;s entire foreign policy , particularly its standing in the Arab and Muslim world . 
During his visit to the region last July , Obama vowed to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict &quot; starting from the minute I &apos;m sworn into office . &quot; 
He cannot lose any time in fulfilling that pledge . 
Unlike the insoluble mess that he inherits in the broader Middle East , the road to a comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli dispute has already been paved , and no wheels would have to be reinvented . 
Leadership and commitment are what is required , and Obama &apos;s &quot; Yes , we can &quot; campaign has already shown that he has both .
