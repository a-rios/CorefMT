The Climate Imperative 
NEW DELHI - Today , international action on climate change is urgent and essential . 
Indeed , there can no longer be any debate about the need to act , because the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , of which I am chairman , has established climate change as an unequivocal reality beyond scientific doubt . 
For instance , changes are taking place in precipitation patterns , with a trend toward higher precipitation levels in the world &apos;s upper latitudes and lower precipitation in some sub-tropical and tropical regions , as well as in the Mediterranean area . 
The number of extreme precipitation events is also increasing - and are increasingly widespread . 
Moreover , the frequency and intensity of heat waves , floods , and droughts are on the rise . 
This change in the amount and pattern of rainfall has serious implications for many economic activities , as well as for countries &quot; preparedness to handle emergencies such as large-scale coastal flooding or heavy snowfall . 
Some parts of the world are more vulnerable than others to these changes . 
The Arctic region , in particular , has been warming at twice the rate of the rest of the globe . 
Coral reefs , mega-deltas ( which include cities like Shanghai , Kolkata , and Dhaka ) , and small island states are also extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels . 
Other negative effects of climate change include possible reductions in crop yields . 
Climate change would also lead to increased water stress , which by 2020 could affect 75-250 million people in Africa alone . 
Overall , temperature increases are projected to increase by the year 2100 within a range of 1.1 to 6.4 ˚ C. In order to focus on this set of outcomes , the IPCC has come up with a best estimate at the lower end of this range of 1.8 ˚ C , and 4 ˚ C at the upper end . 
Even at the lower estimate , the consequences of climate change could be severe in several parts of the world , including an increase in water stress , serious effects on ecosystems and food security , and threats to life and property as a result of coastal flooding . 
There also may be serious direct consequences for human health if climate change is not checked , particularly increased morbidity and mortality as a result of heat waves , floods , and droughts . 
Moreover , the distribution of some diseases would change , making human populations more vulnerable . 
Because the impact of climate change is global , it is essential that the world as a whole take specific measures to adapt . 
But it is already clear that the capacity of some communities to adapt will quickly be exceeded if climate change goes unmitigated . 
To help these most vulnerable communities , it is essential for the world to devise a plan of action to limit the emission of greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) . 
Several scenarios have been assessed by the IPCC , and one that would limit future temperature increase to between 2.0-2.4 ˚ C would require that emissions peak no later than 2015 , and decline thereafter . 
The rate of decline would then determine the extent to which the worst effects of climate change can be avoided . 
The IPCC also found that the cost of such a strict effort at mitigation would not exceed 3 % of global GDP in 2030 . 
Moreover , there are enormous co-benefits to mitigation : lower emissions of GHGs would be accompanied by lower air pollution and increased energy security , agricultural output , and employment . 
If these co-benefits were taken fully into account , that price tag of 3 % of GDP in 2030 would be substantially lower , perhaps even negative . 
The world could actually enhance economic output and welfare by pursuing a path of mitigation . 
The need for international action , therefore , stems from two important observations arising out of the IPCC &apos;s work . 
First , if we do not mitigate emissions of GHGs , the negative effects of climate change will be difficult to reverse , implying great hardship and possibly danger to mankind and other species . 
Second , the benefits of mitigating emissions of GHGs are so overwhelming that this , combined with the prospect of the harm resulting from inaction , makes it imperative for the world to devise an international response and a plan of action . 
Given the challenge facing us , the magnitude and nature of which were clearly brought out by the IPCC , the Copenhagen Conference later this year must produce a multi-lateral agreement that deals adequately with climate change .
