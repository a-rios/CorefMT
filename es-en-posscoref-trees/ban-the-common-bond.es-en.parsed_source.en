Ban the Common Bond 
FRANKFURT - With the deepening of the global financial crisis , spreads between the government bonds of different European Monetary Union ( EMU ) countries for a while widened dramatically . 
Relative to German bonds , the spreads in February of secondary-market yields of government bonds with maturities of close to ten years were 141 basis points for Italy , 257 for Greece , and 252 for Ireland , compared to just 32 , 84 , and 25 basis points , respectively , in 2000 . 
In EMU &apos;s early years , long-term interest rates in euro-zone countries more or less converged to the low levels seen in countries like France , Germany , and the Netherlands before the euro &apos;s introduction . 
Italy and Greece enjoyed huge declines in the cost of servicing their public debt in comparison to pre-EMU days . 
For many people , the introduction of the euro meant not only that currency risk - i.e. , the risk of devaluation - had disappeared , but also that all euro-zone members now belonged to an economic area of monetary stability and , thanks to the discipline of the Stability and Growth Pact , of fiscal stability . 
Moreover , before the crisis , differences in long-term interest rates among EMU members were around 25 basis points , despite unfavorable fiscal developments in some EMU countries . 
But today , countries with rising budget deficits , like Ireland , along with countries with high levels of public debt , like Greece and Italy , are at risk to pay substantially higher rates on their government bonds . 
Risk-averse investors may now demand higher risk premia for buying bonds from countries seen as weak debtors . 
On the other hand long-term interest rates in countries with stronger fiscal positions - France , Germany , and Finland - have enjoyed low rates as a consequence of a &quot; flight to quality . &quot; 
This rise in long-term interest rates has hit the countries with sharply deteriorating fiscal positions hardest . 
It is even suggested that some countries might abandon EMU if this process continues - a threat that , if carried out , would amount to economic suicide . 
It comes as no surprise , then , that the idea of a common European bond is becoming popular as a way to counter the risk of rising EMU interest-rate spreads . 
The main idea is to reduce the risk premia paid by debtors with lower fiscal credibility . 
But this can be achieved only by implicit or explicit guarantees from EMU countries with sound public finances . 
A &quot; true &quot; pan-European bond would have to entail a joint guarantee by all countries of the full bond issue , with the &quot; strongest &quot; guaranteeing the &quot; weakest , &quot; which supporters of a bond idea suggest constitutes true European solidarity . 
A common bond would eliminate the interest-rate spread between bonds issued by different euro-zone countries , so the question that must be addressed is what effect its issuance would have on the level of the interest rate , and more importantly on future fiscal policy and the euro itself . 
A common euro-zone bond certainly implies that countries like France and Germany would have to pay higher interest rates , ultimately resulting in higher tax burdens for their citizens . 
Moreover , once the markets expect substantial amounts of the common bond to be issued , interest rates on the huge stock of existing - purely national - bonds of solid countries would be likely to increase substantially . 
No one can possibly know in advance exactly how big this &quot; bill &quot; might be , though that question - important as that is - misses the crucial point : a common bond would be the first step down a slippery slope to bail-outs , and thus to the end of the euro area as a zone of stability . 
To see why , recall that the immediate trigger for rising interest-rate spreads was financial markets &quot; growing concerns about the solidity of some euro-zone countries , owing to dramatic deterioration in their current and expected fiscal positions . 
A common bond would be no cure for a lack of fiscal discipline ; on the contrary , it would be no more than a placebo for a &quot; weak &quot; country , but it would also be harmful because it would foster the illusion that it is possible to get out of fiscal difficulty without undertaking fundamental reform . 
Encouraging weak countries to prolong their reliance on budget deficits by holding out the hope of a de facto bail-out would be very costly for EMU &apos;s more solid countries , while undermining EMU &apos;s hard-won credibility as an area of stability and fiscal soundness . 
And this latter cost would have to be paid by all euro-zone countries . 
A pan-European bond would also have serious political repercussions . 
Any policy that forces countries that opted for fiscal solidity to pay for those with large deficits and high debt levels would strongly undermine public support for the euro zone . 
&quot; Solidarity &quot; in the true sense means that all euro-zone countries should comply with EMU &apos;s fundamental rules by adhering to the Stability and Growth Pact and the &quot; no bail-outs &quot; principle . 
Countries tempted to undermine these principles by failing to fulfill their solemn commitments only demonstrate their own lack of solidarity .
