The Diet Debacle 
SAN FRANCISCO - Two seemingly benign nutritional maxims are at the root of all dietary evil : A calorie is a calorie , and You are what you eat . Both ideas are now so entrenched in public consciousness that they have become virtually unassailable . 
As a result , the food industry , aided and abetted by ostensibly well-meaning scientists and politicians , has afflicted humankind with the plague of chronic metabolic disease , which threatens to bankrupt health care worldwide . 
The United States currently spends $ 147 billion on obesity-related health care annually . 
Previously , one could have argued that these were affluent countries &quot; diseases , but the United Nations announced last year that chronic metabolic disease ( including diabetes , heart disease , cancer , and dementia ) is a bigger threat to the developing world than is infectious disease , including HIV . 
These two nutritional maxims give credence to the food industry &apos;s self-serving corollaries : If a calorie is a calorie , then any food can be part of a balanced diet ; and , if we are what we eat , then everyone chooses what they eat . 
Again , both are misleading . 
If one &apos;s weight really is a matter of personal responsibility , how can we explain toddler obesity ? 
Indeed , the US has an obesity epidemic in six-month-olds . They don &apos;t diet or exercise . 
Something else is going on . 
Consider the following diets : Atkins ( all fat and no carbohydrates ) ; traditional Japanese ( all carbohydrates and little fat ) ; and Ornish ( even less fat and carbohydrates with lots of fiber ) . 
All three help to maintain , and in some cases even improve , metabolic health , because the liver has to deal with only one energy source at a time . 
That is how human bodies are designed to metabolize food . 
Our hunter ancestors ate fat , which was transported to the liver and broken down by the lipolytic pathway to deliver fatty acids to the mitochondria ( the subcellular structures that burn food to create energy ) . 
On the occasion of a big kill , any excess dietary fatty acids were packaged into low-density lipoproteins and transported out of the liver to be stored in peripheral fat tissue . 
As a result , our forebears &quot; livers stayed healthy . 
Meanwhile , our gatherer ancestors ate carbohydrates ( polymers of glucose ) , which was also transported to the liver , via the glycolytic pathway , and broken down for energy . 
Any excess glucose stimulated the pancreas to release insulin , which transported glucose into peripheral fat tissue , and which also caused the liver to store glucose as glycogen ( liver starch ) . 
So their livers also stayed healthy . 
And nature did its part by supplying all naturally occurring foodstuffs with either fat or carbohydrate as the energy source , not both . 
Even fatty fruits - coconut , olives , avocados - are low in carbohydrate . 
Our metabolisms started to malfunction when humans began consuming fat and carbohydrates at the same meal . 
The liver mitochondria could not keep up with the energy onslaught , and had no choice but to employ a little-used escape valve called &quot; de novo lipogenesis &quot; ( new fat-making ) to turn excess energy substrate into liver fat . 
Liver fat mucks up the workings of the liver . 
It is the root cause of the phenomenon known as &quot; insulin resistance &quot; and the primary process that drives chronic metabolic disease . 
In other words , neither fat nor carbohydrates are problematic - until they are combined . 
The food industry does precisely that , mixing more of both into the Western diet for palatability and shelf life , thereby intensifying insulin resistance and chronic metabolic disease . 
But there is one exception to this formulation : sugar . 
Sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup are comprised of one molecule of glucose ( not especially sweet ) and one molecule of fructose ( very sweet ) . 
While glucose is metabolized by the glycolytic pathway , fructose is metabolized by the lipolytic pathway , and is not insulin-regulated . 
Thus , when sugar is ingested in excess , the liver mitochondria are so overwhelmed that they have no choice but to build liver fat . 
Today , 33 % of Americans have a fatty liver , which causes chronic metabolic disease . 
Prior to 1900 , Americans consumed less than 30 grams of sugar per day , or about 6 % of total calories . 
In 1977 , it was 75 grams / day , and in 1994 , up to 110 grams / day . 
Currently , adolescents average 150 grams / day ( roughly 30 % of total calories ) - a five-fold increase in one century , and a two-fold increase in a generation . 
In the past 50 years , consumption of sugar has also doubled worldwide . 
Worse yet , other than the ephemeral pleasure that it provides , there is not a single biochemical process that requires dietary fructose ; it is a vestigial nutrient , left over from the evolutionary differentiation between plants and animals . 
It is therefore clear that a calorie is not a calorie . 
Fats , carbohydrates , fructose , and glucose are all metabolized differently in the body . 
Furthermore , you are what you do with what you eat.Combining fat and carbohydrate places high demands on the metabolic process . 
And adding sugar is particularly egregious . 
Indeed , while food companies would have you believe that sugar can be part of a balanced diet , the bottom line is that they have created an unbalanced one . 
Of the 600,000 food items available in the US , 80 % are laced with added sugar . 
People cannot be held responsible for what they put in their mouths when their choices have been co-opted . 
And this brings us back to those obese toddlers . 
The fructose content of a soft drink is 5.3 % . 
Of course , many parents might refuse to give soft drinks to their children , but the fructose content of soy formula is 5.1 % , and 6 % for juice . 
We have a long way to go to debunk dangerous nutritional dogmas . 
Until we do , we will make little headway in reversing an imminent medical and economic disaster .
