Who Will Help the Poor ? 
PARIS - With the deepening of the economic crisis and the prospect of another recession looming large on the horizon , growing social inequality has become an increasingly urgent issue . 
How does one reinforce a sense of solidarity and responsibility within a country ? 
Who will protect the weakest ? 
As I ponder this issue , I am reminded of a debate that I had more than ten years ago in Berlin with the German theologian Hans KÃ¼ng and American and Asian participants . 
The subject was &quot; Globalization and Ethics &quot; - specifically , a comparison of the ways that Europe , the United States and Asia protect the most fragile members of their respective societies . 
All of the participants agreed that in Europe the state traditionally filled the role played by private philantropy in the US and by the family in Asia . 
But we all hastened to add that no model was &quot; pure , &quot; i.e. , the family was no longer what it used to be in Asia , the state was playing a bigger role than expected in America , and it was often underperforming in Europe . 
Reality has become even more complicated since then : the family &apos;s role continues to decline in Asia ; philantropy , despite a few extraordinarily generous individuals , has more than met its limits in America ; and , with the possible exception of the Nordic countries , the state in Europe , overburdened by debt , no longer has the means or the will to shoulder new responsibilities . 
So who will take on the responsibility to protect the weakest if none of these three actors can do it properly ? 
Are we heading toward a world united by shared incompetence and inadequacy ? 
In the Western world , the poorest are the worst affected by economic stagnation . 
But , in rapidly growing emerging-market countries , the rich tend to close their eyes to the suffering of the poorest , except when they feel threatened by the risk of political upheaval , as in , say , Saudi Arabia . 
In fact , wealthy elites in emerging countries live in a state of denial towards their poor , literally ignoring them . 
Brazil and India are particularly striking in this regard . 
Economic growth is necessary , but not sufficient : a strong sense of social responsibility is needed as well . 
It would be absurd to condemn , as some do , globalization as the main and only culprit in the erosion of traditional sources of support for the poor . 
Globalization is above all a context , an environment , even if the consequences of the first major financial and economic crisis of the global age will further deepen the gap between the very rich and the very poor . 
But globalization makes the weakest among us more visible , and therefore makes the absence of social justice more unacceptable . 
A world of much greater transparency and interdependency creates new responsibilities for the rich . 
Or , more precisely , it makes the old responsibility to protect the weakest both more difficult and more urgent . 
In a world of increasing complexity , perhaps what is needed are simple solutions . 
One could follow , for example , Adam Smith &apos;s principle of comparative advantage : what Europe does best is the state , while Asia still relies on the family and the US continues to focus on individual initiative . 
The problem is that in a world of universal benchmarking , the legitimacy of solutions will stem more than ever from their cultural acceptability and their efficiency . 
In Western Europe , for example , the call for sacrifice from all citizens in order to resolve the debt crisis runs up against a lingering perception that not all will contribute equally , and that social inequality will be exacerbated by austerity . 
Restoring growth in the short term while addressing debt problems in the medium and long term may well be the only valid response to the crisis . 
But it will not work , in Europe or elsewhere , without a much greater emphasis on social justice . 
While some of the very rich complain , as Warren Buffett did recently , that they do not pay enough taxes , the enlightened generosity of these happy few - who want to save capitalism and liberalism - is unlikely to be emulated by the new rich in the emerging countries , much less by the rich elsewhere . 
Let &apos;s be realistic : people like Buffett and Bill Gates have very few followers even among the very rich in the US . 
And can Asian societies really revive an effective sense of family responsibility ? 
Globalization does appear to have weakened cultural differences noticeably in the past decade . 
But , when it comes to the protection of the weakest and the struggle against rising social injustice , perhaps &quot; global deculturation &quot; creates an opportunity to combine the best of what remains in particular traditions . 
Perhaps countries should seek to base their social-welfare systems on a new synthesis of the state , the family , and philanthropy .
