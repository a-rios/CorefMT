America &apos;s G-Zero Moment 
NEW YORK - The 2008 financial crisis marked the end of the global order as we knew it . 
In advance of the upcoming G-8 summit , it is impossible to overlook the fact that , for the first time in seven decades , the United States cannot drive the international agenda or provide global leadership on all of today &apos;s most pressing problems . 
Indeed , the US has trimmed its presence abroad by refusing to contribute to a eurozone bailout , intervene in Syria , or use force to contain Iran &apos;s nuclear breakout ( despite strong Israeli support ) . 
President Barack Obama officially ended the war in Iraq , and is withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan at a pace constrained only by the need to save face . 
America is handing off the leadership baton - even if no other country or group of countries is willing or able to grasp it . 
In short , US foreign policy may be as active as ever , but it is downsizing and becoming more exacting about its priorities . 
As a result , many global challenges - climate change , trade , resource scarcity , international security , cyber-warfare , and nuclear proliferation , to name a few - are bound to loom larger . 
Welcome to the G-Zero world , a more turbulent , uncertain environment in which coordination on global policy issues falls by the wayside . 
Paradoxically , this new environment , though daunting , is less troublesome for the US ; in fact , it provides fresh opportunities for the US to capitalize on its unique position . 
The G-Zero world is not all bad for the US - if it plays its cards right . 
Many residual strengths take on greater importance in such a world , and America remains the world &apos;s only true superpower and its largest economy - still more than twice the size of China &apos;s . 
Its defense expenditures represent nearly half the world total , and exceed those of the next 17 countries combined . 
The dollar remains the world &apos;s reserve currency , and investors &quot; scramble into US government debt at every peak in the crisis since 2008 has underscored America &apos;s safe-haven status ( even in crises that America caused ) . 
Likewise , the US continues to lead in entrepreneurship , research and development , higher education , and technological innovation . 
Moreover , it is now the world &apos;s largest natural-gas producer and calorie exporter , which has reduced its vulnerability to price shocks or food shortages . 
No country rivals America &apos;s promotion of the rule of law , liberal democracy , transparency , and free enterprise . 
While other countries certainly support these values , only the US has been willing , healthy , and big enough to ensure that they prevail . 
So , as America curtails its global leadership , it will find itself in more demand . 
Consider Asia , for example . As China &apos;s economic importance and regional influence grows , its neighbors are seeking to deepen ties with the US . 
Japan , Australia , Indonesia , and Taiwan have all recently closed trade and security-related deals with the US . 
Even Burma has gotten on board , resuming diplomatic engagement with the US while trying to work its way out of China &apos;s shadow . 
In other words , in a G-Zero world , an increasingly aggressive global environment makes the US all the more appealing to countries seeking to hedge their bets . As a result , the US has an opportunity to act more precisely in its own interests . 
Supplying less leadership allows the US to weigh opportunity costs before taking action , and to select the issues and circumstances that suit it the best . In this environment , military intervention in Libya does not necessitate the same in Syria . 
The extent to which the US will capitalize on these opportunities remains to be seen . 
In fact , America &apos;s short-term advantages pose the biggest obstacle to its long-term outlook . 
Call this the &quot; safe-haven curse &quot; : as long as the US remains the safest port in any storm , it faces no immediate pressure to address its weaknesses . 
For example , for all of the hand-wringing about America &apos;s national debt , investors will continue to loan the US money . 
Over the long term , however , US policymakers must make steady progress in restoring confidence in the nation &apos;s fiscal health by cutting politically sacred programs like social security , Medicare , and defense . 
Officials will have to put aside short-term motives and party orthodoxy to bolster America &apos;s aging infrastructure , reform its education and immigration systems , and pursue long-term fiscal consolidation . 
America &apos;s advantages in the G-Zero world afford it the chance to invest in the future . 
But , by cushioning against sufficiently calamitous risks , the same advantages allow the US to procrastinate . 
American politicians need to recognize the new G-Zero reality and rebuild America &apos;s domestic sources of strength , even if only incrementally . If they do , the US will have the vigor and flexibility to shape the next world order . 
America &apos;s political system usually works well in crises . But , thanks to its residual advantages in a leaderless world , the US need not rely on a crisis to precipitate action . 
It need only seize the G-Zero moment .
