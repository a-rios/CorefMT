The Arab World &apos;s Triple Crisis 
LONDON - Economic want and inequality , as much as political repression , incited the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions . 
It is , of course , to be hoped that new governments in these countries , and other Arab leaders , will better address ordinary people &apos;s grievances . 
But a mere change of government will not make these countries &quot; economic problems go away . 
Indeed , the converging effects of population growth , climate change , and energy depletion are setting the stage for a looming triple crisis . 
The region accounts for 6.3 % of the world &apos;s population but only 1.4 % of its renewable fresh water . 
Twelve of the world &apos;s 15 most water-scarce countries - Algeria , Libya , Tunisia , Jordan , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Yemen , Oman , the UAE , Kuwait , Bahrain , Israel , and Palestine - are in the region , and in eight , available fresh water amounts annually to less than 250 cubic meters per person . 
Three-quarters of the region &apos;s available fresh water is in just four countries : Iran , Iraq , Syria , and Turkey . 
Water consumption in the region is linked overwhelmingly to industrial agriculture . 
From 1965 to 1997 , Arab population growth drove demand for agricultural development , leading to a doubling of land under irrigation . 
Demographic expansion in these countries is set to dramatically worsen their predicament . 
Although birth rates are falling , one-third of the overall population is below 15 years old , and large numbers of young women are reaching reproductive age , or soon will be . 
The United Kingdom &apos;s Ministry of Defense has projected that by 2030 the population of the Middle East will increase by 132 % , and that of sub-Saharan Africa by 81 % , generating an unprecedented &quot; youth bulge . &quot; 
The World Bank &apos;s Water Sector Assessment Report on the Gulf countries , published in 2005 , predicts that these demographic pressures will likely cause the availability of fresh water to halve , exacerbating the danger of inter-state conflict . 
Competition to control water has already played a key role in regional geopolitical tensions , for instance , between Turkey and Syria ; 
Egypt , Sudan , and Ethiopia ; and between Saudi Arabia and its neighbors , Qatar , Bahrain , and Jordan . 
A halving of available water supplies could turn these tensions into open hostilities . 
Indeed , while economic growth , accompanied by greater urbanization and higher per capita incomes , has translated into greater demand for fresh water , the population movements that have resulted are now exacerbating local ethnic tensions . 
As early as 2015 , the average Arab will be forced to survive on less than 500 cubic meters of water per year , a level defined as severe scarcity . 
Shifts in rainfall patterns will certainly affect crops , particularly rice . 
A &quot; business-as-usual &quot; model for climate change suggests that global average temperatures could rise by 4 Â° Celsius by mid-century . 
This would devastate agriculture in the Middle East and North Africa , with crop yields falling by 15-35 % , depending on the strength of carbon fertilization . 
The worldwide cost of infrastructure capable of responding to the intensifying water crisis could amount to trillions of dollars , and its development would itself be energy-intensive . 
As a result , new infrastructure would only mitigate the impact of scarcity on richer countries . 
Hydrocarbon energy depletion is set to complicate matters even more . 
In its World Energy Outlook for 2010 , the International Energy Agency argued that conventional oil production worldwide probably peaked in 2006 , and is now declining . 
This conclusion fits the latest output data , which shows that world oil production has been undulating but gradually falling since around 2005 . 
Yet the IEA also argued that the shortfall will be made up from greater exploitation of unconventional oil and gas reserves , albeit at far higher prices , owing to the greater environmental and extraction costs . 
The bad news is that the IEA &apos;s optimism about unconventional sources could be misplaced . 
The six biggest Middle Eastern oil-producing countries officially hold around 740 billion barrels ( Gbs ) of proven oil reserves . 
But the British geologist Euan Mearns of Aberdeen University notes that published data put the most likely size of these reserves at only around 350 Gbs . 
And the UK government &apos;s former chief scientific adviser , David King , found in a study for Energy Policy that official world oil reserves had been overstated by up to one-third - implying that we are on the verge of a major &quot; tipping point &quot; in oil production . 
All of this means not only that the era of cheap oil is over , but also that , within the next decade or so , major oil-producing countries will struggle against costly geological constraints . 
If that proves to be true , then by 2020 - and perhaps as early as 2015 - the contribution of Middle East oil to world energy consumption could become negligible . 
That would mean a catastrophic loss of state revenues for today &apos;s major Arab oil-producing countries , rendering them highly vulnerable to the compounding consequences of existing water shortages , rapid demographic expansion , climate change , and declining crop yields . 
This worst-case scenario is not inevitable , but there is only a short window of opportunity for policies to address the situation . 
Reviving conservation , management , and distribution efforts could reduce water consumption and increase efficiency , but these measures need to be combined with radical reforms to speed the transition away from oil dependence to a zero-carbon renewable-energy infrastructure . 
Concerted investments in health , education , and citizens &apos; rights , especially for women , are the key tools for alleviating population growth in the region and diversifying its economies . 
It is now increasingly clear that Arab governments that fail to implement such measures urgently are unlikely to survive .
