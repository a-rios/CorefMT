In Finance We Distrust 
MILAN - Around the world , the debate about financial regulation is coming to a head . 
A host of arguments and proposals is in play , often competing with one another - and thus inciting public and political confusion . 
One approach to financial re-regulation - supported by arguments of varying persuasiveness - is to limit the size and scope of financial institutions . 
Some claim that smaller entities can fail without impairing the system , thus sparing taxpayers the cost of a bailout . 
But if systemic risk emerges in ways that are not yet fully understood , smaller banks may all fail or become distressed simultaneously , damaging the real economy . 
A second , hotly debated argument is that limiting banks &quot; size and scope has relatively low costs in terms of performance . 
This point is used to bolster a third argument : large institutions have undue political influence and thus &quot; capture &quot; their regulators . 
Put bluntly , large and profitable financial institutions will find a way to get the regulatory system they want - one that is compatible with a highly profitable trading super-structure that goes beyond the requirements of hedging and seeks to maximize short-term gains . 
A second approach , on which there is substantial agreement in principle , is to limit leverage . 
The main argument is that high leverage contributes powerfully to systemic risk - a condition in which asset prices move in a highly correlated way , and distress , when it occurs , spreads quickly . Leverage is also partially caused by misperceptions of risk and mispricing of liquidity . It is desirable to constrain leverage , but not to the point of increasing the cost of capital and investment . 
Moreover , few would disagree that , as the complexity of the system increases , gaps and asymmetries in terms of information , knowledge , and expertise are multiplying . 
Such asymmetries impair market performance in a variety of ways , and conflicts of interest are particularly dangerous in such an environment because they create an incentive to exploit precisely these advantages . 
Rigorous disclosure requirements that include conflicts of interest are one way to limit the potential damage . 
Or the conflicts can be limited by regulating the scope of financial institutions . 
For example , asset management , distribution , underwriting and securitization , and proprietary trading would be separated in various ways . 
This approach has the added advantage of preventing different risk profiles and their appropriate capital requirements from getting mixed up in the same entity and balance sheet . 
There are two other ways to address complexity and asymmetries . 
One , widely adopted in developing countries , is simply to impose restrictions on products ( for example , derivatives and hedge funds ) on the grounds that the upside in terms of risk avoidance far outweigh the costs - less access to capital and reduced risk spreading . 
The other way is to try to reduce the informational gaps or their impact by regulating the expertise and incentives surrounding the rating process ( the failure of which had serious consequences in the current crisis ) . 
At a somewhat deeper level , there are two conflicting threads running through the public debate surrounding the crisis . 
One is the &quot; perfect storm &quot; position : there were very many failures , misperceptions , informational asymmetries , and complexities , as well as much repugnant behavior , but it never occurred to market participants , regulators , or academics that the aggregate effect would be a near-collapse of the system . 
Critics of that argument maintain that sophisticated players understood the systemic risks , didn &apos;t care , and cynically played the game that they helped to create - in some cases for enormous profit . 
It now seems universally accepted ( often implicitly ) that government should establish the structure and rules for the financial system , with participants then pursuing their self-interest within that framework . 
If the framework is right , the system will perform well . 
The rules bear the burden of ensuring the collective social interest in the system &apos;s stability , efficiency , and fairness . 
But in a complex system in which expertise , insight , and real-time information are not concentrated in one place , and certainly not in government and regulatory circles , reliance on such a framework seems deficient and unwise . 
Moreover , it ignores the importance of trust . 
A better starting point , I believe , is the notion of shared responsibility for the stability of the system and its social benefits - shared , that is , by participants and regulators . 
It is striking that no senior executive of whom I am aware has laid out in any detail how his or her institution &apos;s expertise could be deployed in pursuit of the collective goal of stability . 
The suspicion that underlies much of today &apos;s public anger is that these institutions , having influenced the formulation of the legal and ethical rules , could do more to contribute to stability than just obey them . 
The finance industry , regulators , and political leaders need to create a shared sense of collective responsibility for the system as a whole and its impact on the rest of the economy . 
This set of values should be deeply embedded in the industry - and thus should transcend haggling over regulation . 
It should take precedence over narrow self-interest or the potential profit opportunities associated with exploiting an informational advantage . 
And it should be thought of as an addition to the guiding norms , rules , and ethics associated with &quot; normal &quot; times . 
Some will object that this idea won &apos;t work because it runs counter to greedy human nature . 
Yet such values shape other professions . 
In medicine , there is a huge and unbridgeable gap in expertise and information between doctors and patients . 
The potential for abuse is enormous . 
By itself , such a shift in values and the implicit model that defines roles certainly will not solve the challenge of systemic risk . 
Neither will fiddling with the rules . 
Taken seriously , however , it could help provide an ongoing reminder of the importance of the financial sector to the broader well-being of the economy . 
It might even help start rebuilding trust .
