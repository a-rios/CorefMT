Let Finance Skeptics Take Over 
CAMBRIDGE - The race is on to fill the most important economic policy position in the world . 
United States Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke &apos;s term ends in January , and President Barack Obama must decide before then : either re-appoint Bernanke or go with someone else - the names most often mentioned are Larry Summers and Janet Yellen - with more solid Democratic credentials . 
It is a decision of momentous consequence not just for the US , but also for the world economy . 
As guardians of the nation &apos;s money supply and setters of short-term interest rates , central bankers have always played a critical role . 
Lower the interest rate too much , and inflation and monetary instability result . 
Raise it too much , and the economy slides into recession and unemployment . 
Monetary policy is hardly a science , so a good central banker must be humble . 
He must appreciate the limits of his understanding and of the efficacy of the tools at his disposal . 
Yet he cannot afford to be perceived as indecisive , which would only invite destabilizing financial speculation . 
Indeed , as important as their functions are , in recent decades central banks have become even more significant as a consequence of the development of financial markets . 
Even when not formally designated as such , central banks have become the guardians of financial-market sanity . 
The dangers of failing at this task have been made painfully clear in the sub-prime mortgage debacle . 
Under Obama &apos;s proposed new rules , the Fed will have even larger responsibilities , and will be charged with averting financial crises and ensuring that banks are not taking on too much risk . 
This is a job at which former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan proved to be a spectacular failure . 
His blind spot on financial-market excesses - the little &quot; flaw &quot; in his thinking , as he later termed - left him oblivious to the dangers of Wall Street titans &quot; financial innovations . 
As a member of the Fed &apos;s Board of Governors under Greenspan during 2002-2005 , Bernanke can also be faulted for having played along . 
The Fed chairman exerts global influence not only through monetary policy , but also through his words . 
He sets the tone for policy discussions and helps shape the belief system within which policymakers around the world operate . 
What hampered Greenspan and Bernanke as financial regulators was that they were excessively in awe of Wall Street and what it does . 
They operated under the assumption that what is good for Wall Street is good for Main Street . 
This will no doubt change as a result of the crisis , even if Bernanke remains at the helm . 
But what the world needs is a Fed chairman who is instinctively skeptical of financial markets and their social value . 
Here are some of the lies that the finance industry tells itself and others , and which any new Fed chairman will need to resist . 
Prices set by financial markets are the right ones for allocating capital and other resources to their most productive uses . 
That is what textbooks and financiers tell you , but we have now many reasons to be wary . 
In the language of economists , there are far too many &quot; market failures &quot; in finance for these prices to be a good guide for resource allocation . 
There are &quot; agency problems &quot; that drive a wedge between the interests of the owners of capital and the interests of bank CEOs and other finance executives . 
Asymmetric information between sellers and buyers of financial products can easily leave buyers vulnerable to abuse , as we saw with mortgage-backed securities . 
Implicit or explicit bail-out guarantees , moreover , induce too much risk-taking . 
Large financial intermediaries endanger the entire financial system when they use the wrong risk model and make bad decisions . 
Regulation is at best a partial remedy for such problems . 
So the prices that financial markets generate are as likely to send the wrong signals as they are to send the right ones . 
Financial markets discipline governments . 
This is one of the most commonly stated benefits of financial markets , yet the claim is patently false . 
When markets are in a euphoric state , they are in no position to exert discipline on any borrower , let alone a government with a reasonable credit rating . 
If in doubt , ask scores of emerging-market governments that had no difficulty borrowing in international markets , typically in the run-up to an eventual payments crisis . 
In many of these cases - Turkey during the 1990 &quot; s is a good example - financial markets enabled irresponsible governments to embark on unsustainable borrowing sprees . 
When &quot; market discipline &quot; comes , it is usually too late , too severe , and applied indiscriminately . 
The spread of financial markets is an unmitigated good . 
Well , no . 
Financial globalization was supposed to have enabled poor , undercapitalized countries to gain access to the savings of rich countries . 
It was supposed to have promoted risk-sharing globally . 
In fact , neither expectation was fulfilled . 
In the years before the financial crash , capital moved from poor countries to rich countries , rather than vice versa . 
( This may not have been a bad thing , since it turns out that large ( net ) borrowers in international markets tend to grow less rapidly than others . ) 
And economic volatility has actually increased in emerging markets under financial globalization , owing in part to frequent financial crises spawned by mobile capital . 
Financial innovation is a great engine of productivity growth and economic well-being . Again , no . 
Imagine that we had asked five years ago for examples of really useful kinds of financial innovation . 
We would have heard about a long-list of mortgage-related instruments , which supposedly made financing available to home buyers who would not have been able to purchase homes otherwise . 
We now know where that led us . 
The truth lies closer to Paul Volcker &apos;s view that for most people the automated teller machine ( ATM ) has brought bigger benefits than any financially-engineered bond . 
The world economy has been run for too long by finance enthusiasts . 
It is time that finance skeptics began to take over .
