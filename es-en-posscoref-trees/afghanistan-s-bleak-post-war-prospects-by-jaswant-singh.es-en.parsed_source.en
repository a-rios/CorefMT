No Exit from Afghanistan 
NEW DELHI - Despite frequent turmoil and repeated invasions , Afghanistan has remained virtually unchanged for centuries . 
Nearly 120 years ago , Winston Churchill described the futility of warfare in the region : &quot; Financially it is ruinous . 
Morally it is wicked . 
Militarily it is an open question , and politically it is a blunder . &quot; 
Churchill &apos;s assessment undoubtedly rings true for many United States and NATO officials today , as they attempt to coordinate an exit from America &apos;s longest overseas combat commitment in history . 
While the war in Afghanistan may have resulted in fewer American deaths and injuries than previous US wars , the human cost remains substantial - especially after factoring in Afghan deaths and injuries . 
Moreover , trillions of dollars have been wasted , with the few positive effects of the US-led military intervention already beginning to fade , and its many adverse consequences continuing to destabilize the region . 
US President Barack Obama is now trying to negotiate a new &quot; status of forces &quot; agreement with the Afghan government in order to establish how many US troops will remain in Afghanistan and the terms of their deployment . 
But the reality is that the US is scuttling from a conflict that it has lost , just as it did in Vietnam almost 40 years ago , leaving the beleaguered population to its own devices . 
Rather than admit defeat , US officials are resorting to diversionary rhetoric . 
For example , speaking recently in New Delhi , Secretary of State John Kerry said that the key to stabilizing Afghanistan is to build a &quot; new silk road &quot; connecting it with central Asia - a cynical contrivance apparently aimed at cloaking America &apos;s failure in illusions of future commerce . 
Kerry &apos;s insistence that the US is not withdrawing , but &quot; drawing down , &quot; is a similarly transparent attempt at manipulation . 
To be sure , America &apos;s presence in Afghanistan has spawned important regional linkages ; unfortunately , they are not the kind that support economic renewal . 
The last decade of war and lawlessness has facilitated the Taliban &apos;s proliferation across Pakistan and Afghanistan , leading the Taliban to consider itself an indefatigable force - a belief that could lead its leaders to undercut any progress toward stability . 
In fact , the Taliban &apos;s confidence already drove them to disrupt plans for peace talks with the Afghan government . 
After agreeing to establish an office in Qatar exclusively to host the talks , in June the Taliban opened a quasi-embassy of the &quot; Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan . &quot; 
The Afghan government responded by suspending talks with the Taliban , as well as the status-of-forces negotiations with the US . 
Pakistan recommends seeking an alternate venue for the negotiations with the Taliban , rather than abandoning reconciliation efforts altogether . 
This bodes well for the resumption of talks , given that Pakistan played a leading role in facilitating the Taliban &apos;s emergence and is now home to the Afghan Taliban &apos;s ruling council , including its leader , Mullah Omar , along with the Pakistani Taliban . 
India &apos;s former ambassador to Afghanistan , Vivek Katju , is confident that Afghan President Hamid Karzai &apos;s anger at the Taliban &apos;s gambit in Qatar will not delay negotiations for long . 
( Indeed , Karzai has reportedly already met with Taliban representatives for secret talks aimed at restarting the stalled peace initiative . ) 
Katju attributes the talks &quot; inevitable resumption to America &apos;s &quot; strategic desperation , &quot; which is so acute that the US would be unlikely even to follow through on Kerry &apos;s pledge to call off the talks if any link to Al Qaeda were found . 
After all , the US has already accepted the Taliban &apos;s unrealistic assurances that it will not use Afghanistan as a base from which to &quot; foment trouble &quot; - that is , execute terrorist attacks - elsewhere . 
Fortunately for the US , the Taliban is no longer a homogeneous group . 
A decade of running and hiding from unrelenting surveillance and targeted drone attacks has caused the movement to splinter . 
Yet , as the security expert Sajjan M. Gohel has observed , &quot; the displaced and disillusioned Taliban youth of today &quot; have &quot; found solace and purpose in an extremely radical interpretation of Islam . &quot; 
The Taliban may no longer be a unified force , but they clearly remain a dangerous one . 
All of these developments have put India in a difficult position . 
In Afghanistan , America &apos;s military was so tactically dependent on Pakistan that , on several occasions , the US encouraged India to curtail development projects , such as rebuilding Afghanistan &apos;s infrastructure . 
Following America &apos;s military withdrawal , Afghanistan will most likely revert to pre-war conditions ; 
In order to make the best of a grim situation , India must be prepared to protect its own interests at all costs . 
After all , as the US extricates itself from its Afghan quagmire , its own national interests will continue to trump all other considerations . 
But China , Pakistan , and Iran also have their own important national-security interests in Afghanistan that each will now do their utmost to guarantee . 
So , while US troops may be leaving Afghanistan , an end to the violence spawned by America &apos;s war remains nothing more than a distant dream - especially for Afghanistan &apos;s South Asian neighbors .
