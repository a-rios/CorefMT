The Terror Next Door . 
NEW DELHI - The fallout from the terror attacks in Mumbai last week has already shaken India . 
Deep and sustained anger across the country - at its demonstrated vulnerability to terror and at the multiple institutional failures that allowed such loss of life - has prompted the resignations of the Home Minister in the national government and the Chief Minister and his Deputy in the state of Maharashtra , of which Mumbai is the capital . 
As evidence mounts that the attacks were planned and directed from Pakistani territory , calls for decisive action have intensified . 
But what can India do ? 
The terrorists hit multiple targets in Mumbai , both literally and figuratively . 
They caused death and destruction to Indians with near-impunity , searing India &apos;s psyche , showing up the limitations of its security apparatus and humiliating its government . 
They dented the worldwide image of India as an emerging economic giant , a success story of the era of globalization and an increasing magnet for investors and tourists . 
Instead the world was made to see an insecure and vulnerable India , a &quot; soft state &quot; bedevilled by enemies who can strike it at will . 
That was not all . 
By singling out Americans , British and Israelis for their malign attention , the terrorists extended the global Islamist war against &quot; Jews and crusaders &quot; to new territory . 
As they dominated the world &apos;s media for three gruesome days , the killers achieved a startling success for their cause , one that must have shaken anti-terrorist experts around the world , who now realize how easy it would be for ten men unafraid of death to hold any city in the world hostage . 
The interrogation of the one surviving terrorist , and evidence from satellite telephone intercepts and other intelligence , has led to an emerging international consensus that the attacks were masterminded by the Wahhabi-inspired Lashkar-e-Taiba , a terrorist group once patronized , protected and trained by Pakistan &apos;s Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) as a useful instrument in their country &apos;s proxy war against India in Kashmir . 
Though banned by General Pervez Musharraf under duress after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Lashkar ( which considers the United States , Israel and India &quot; existential enemies of Islam &quot; ) simply regrouped under a different name and is even more powerful than before . 
The Pakistani military finds militant outfits useful tools to bleed their adversaries in India and Afghanistan , and has shown little inclination to clamp down on them , despite years of assurances that action would be taken to curb their activities . 
In July this year , American intelligence sources publicly revealed that the suicide-bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul had been conducted at the behest of the ISI . 
This episode , along with two climbdowns by Pakistan &apos;s government after public attempts to curb the ISI had been spurned by the Army , confirmed that the civilian government in Islamabad is too weak to challenge the all-powerful military . 
So if the US and India demand , as they will , that Pakistan disband the Lashkar and similar terrorist outfits that have enjoyed military patronage in the past , dismantle their training facilities , freeze their bank accounts ( before they are simply transferred to another name ) and arrest their leaders , they will face a typically Pakistani conundrum : the military isn &apos;t willing , and the civilian government isn &apos;t able . 
India &apos;s government , which has reacted to previous terrorist outrages with calm and restraint , has no choice this time but to respond decisively . 
Anything that smacks of temporizing and appeasement will further inflame the public a few months before national elections are due . 
But India &apos;s government has few good options . 
An earlier assault on India &apos;s Parliament in December 2001 by the Pakistan-based militant organization Jaish-e-Muhammad , nearly triggered a full-scale war between the two countries . In the end India pulled back its deployment on the border . 
Though some hotheads in India now call for military action , including strikes on terrorist facilities in Pakistani territory , this would certainly lead to a war that neither side could win . 
If anything , such an Indian reaction would play into the hands of the terrorists , by strengthening anti-Indian nationalism in Pakistan and diverting forces away from the Afghan borderlands , where they are aiding NATO &apos;s fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda . 
For this reason , the US is likely to press India not to contemplate forceful retaliation that could undermine America &apos;s objectives in Afghanistan . 
And since both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons , the risk of military action spiralling out of control is too grave for any responsible government to contemplate . 
Yet inaction is not an option . 
So India is likely to ask the US to use its undoubted clout with Pakistan - the US is a huge donor of both military and economic assistance to its near-bankrupt ally - to demand tougher action against the militants on its territory . 
The governments of the victims of the Mumbai massacre are also likely to demand accountability from Islamabad . 
Pakistan is likely to face disagreeable diplomatic and economic consequences for inaction . 
But excessive pressure may only bring down the government of President Asif Ali Zardari , who is personally inclined towards rapprochement with India but who knows that every one of his civilian predecessors has been overthrown . 
Contemplating such options , the world may be forced to admit its impotence . 
That will have a chilling result : as long as a military-dominated Pakistan continues , willingly or helplessly , to harbour the perpetrators of Islamist terror , what happened in Mumbai could happen again  -  anywhere .
