Iraq and a Great Leap for Chinese Intellectuals 
Even before images of the first cruise missile strikes on Baghdad reached Chinese TV screens , the country &apos;s intellectuals were debating the US-led war against Iraq and the government &apos;s response . 
Commentaries in leading newspapers and on-line journals demonstrated a diversity of opinion seldom seen in the country &apos;s state-controlled media , and precipitated wider discussion in people &apos;s living rooms . 
Most debates addressed whether the war was justified . 
Opinions were voiced in newspapers and in on-line forums such as the home page of the media school of Qinghua University , widely known as &quot; China &apos;s MIT . &quot; 
It posted an anti-war petition with over 1,000 signatories , mostly academics . 
Although this grassroots response adhered to the government &apos;s anti-war stand , it remains surprising in a country that discourages unscripted political discourse . 
So it was even more surprising to see pro-war sentiments expressed publicly , such as the petition that appeared in the Guangzhou-based weekly newspaper 21st Century World Herald . 
That petition voiced a taboo viewpoint : that &quot; human rights are of greater value than national sovereignty . &quot; 
In a rare challenge to the government , Beijing-based writer Yu Jie , one of the petition &apos;s authors , wrote that China ought to support the war on Iraq . 
Only by embracing universal values and distancing itself from &quot; evil states , &quot; Yu argued , can China rise to the level of the world &apos;s mainstream democracies . 
Others , such as Han Deqiang of Beijing &apos;s aerospace university , who wrote an anti-war commentary that accompanied Yu &apos;s essay , scoffed at such an idea . 
Han called pro-war Chinese intellectuals hopelessly na ? ve and overly &quot; immersed in the American dream . &quot; 
But others supported Yu Jie &apos;s critique . 
The Beijing-based dissident writer Liu Xiaobo , an activist intellectual in the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations , questioned the government &apos;s motives for opposing the war . 
Since 1989 , Liu wrote , the Chinese government has nurtured a strident nationalism to boost its own legitimacy . 
Moreover , Liu argued , the government &apos;s marginalization of pro-war sentiment and promotion of anti-war views accords with its broader effort to ascribe almost every domestic and international disaster to American hegemony . 
Although the surface of this debate is about America and Iraq , the subtext , as always , concerns China . 
Indeed , the debate revealed political fault lines among Chinese intellectuals that could never be openly exposed on domestic policy . 
Ultimately , the two main camps of China &apos;s intelligentsia - the &quot; neo-leftists &quot; ( xin zuo ) and &quot; old liberals &quot; ( lao you )  - ask the question that has divided Chinese intellectuals for a century : what does it mean to be Chinese and also to be modern ? 
Does it mean following the West ( as liberals advocate ) or , as the neo-leftists suggest , is there some Third Way between Communism and western-style democratic capitalism ? 
Most fundamentally , can the scope of economic disaster witnessed following the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse be avoided ? 
Both groups comprise scholars from numerous fields , state intellectuals serving in government think tanks , journalists and even some dissidents . 
Liberals are known to favor more thorough economic and political reforms , such as democratization at the grassroots level and a free press . 
Conservatives insist on a more cautious approach that avoids the &quot; shock therapy &quot; and drastic overhauls experienced in postcommunist Eastern Europe . 
Unlike in Western countries , where intellectuals often engage in head-on public confrontations , most intellectuals in China speak obliquely . 
The invasion of Iraq presented them with a relatively safe topic with which to discuss issues that are normally off limits , such as human rights . 
Scholars used the Iraq debate to ask whether a state relinquishes its sovereignty when it loses popular support - a highly provocative topic in China . 
&quot; A modern sovereign state , first and foremost , bases itself on the recognition of individual rights and democracy , &quot; according to Wang Yi , a liberal scholar . 
&quot; That is to say , given the nature of the current Iraqi regime , it has no right to ask for treatment as a sovereign state . &quot; 
In the pro-war petition , Yu Jie and others made an explicit link between Iraq and China , likening Saddam Hussein , to his &quot; colleague and predecessor , &quot; Mao Zedong , who &quot; disguised the illegitimacy of his authoritarian regime in the name of the people . &quot; 
As the war progressed , pro-war voices increasingly fell silent . 
Some media critics ascribed this to a combination of official censorship and the effect of the scenes of Iraqi civilian deaths played ( and replayed ) on China &apos;s new 24-hour news channel , created especially to cover the war in Iraq . 
At the same time , celebrities like Zhang Ziyi , star of the film Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon joined the anti-war chorus . 
Zhang , who appeared in this year &apos;s Oscar-nominated film Hero , refused to attend the Academy Awards ceremony in Hollywood in protest . 
In any case , speaking out carries a price . 
The relatively independent Nanfang Daily Group , whose members include 21st Century World Herald and the Guangzhou-based liberal magazine Southern Breeze , was closed by the government for &quot; redesign . &quot; 
It may be allowed to publish again , but no one knows when . 
The Hong Kong newspaper The South China Morning Post reported that it would have been closed , permanently , if not for the personal intervention of Hu Jingtao , China &apos;s new president and communist party chairman . 
Despite these setbacks , the debate benefited China &apos;s intellectual climate . 
As ideas advanced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau , George Orwell , and VÃ¡clav Havel enter China &apos;s public discourse , interest grows in such Western thinkers and their political insights . 
This alone amounts to a great leap forward for intellectual freedom .
