Can Asia Free Itself from the IMF ? 
BERKELEY - There has never been a question about the ultimate purpose of the Chiang Mai Initiative ( CMI ) , the system of Asian financial supports created in 2000 in that Thai city . 
That purpose , of course , is to create an Asian Monetary Fund , i.e. , a regional alternative to the International Monetary Fund , whose tender ministrations during the 1997-98 financial crisis have not been forgotten or forgiven . 
So far , however , the CMI has been all horse and no saddle . 
Its credits and swaps have never been activated . 
The distress following the failure of Lehman Brothers would have been an obvious occasion . 
Yet , revealingly , the Bank of Korea , the central bank hit hardest , negotiated a $ 30 billion foreign-currency swap with the United States Federal Reserve , not with its ASEAN + 3 partners . 
Now , we are told , ASEAN + 3 has achieved another great breakthrough , the so-called Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization ( CMIM ) , aimed at turning its bilateral swaps and credits into a regional reserve pool . 
The goal was set in 2005 , and last month ASEAN + 3 finance ministers negotiated the details . 
They specified contributions to their $ 120 billion pool , set down borrowing entitlements , and allocated voting shares . 
The agreement on contributions is significant , it is said , because China and Japan will both contribute 32 % . 
In previous regional agreements , like capital subscriptions to the Asian Development Bank , China had always been treated as a second-rate power and asked to contribute less . 
Indeed , China had shunned Japan &apos;s 1997 proposal to create an Asian Monetary Fund precisely because it worried that it would play second fiddle . 
That China is now acknowledged as a co-equal means that it will not stand in the way of further cooperation . 
Also significant , we are told , is the agreement to make decisions by simple majority , with countries &quot; votes to be roughly in proportion to their contributions . 
This means that no single country can block action , in contrast to the IMF executive board , which makes decisions by consensus , giving large countries like the United States de facto veto power . 
But do these new rules really matter ? 
Disbursing more than 20 % of the credits available to a country still requires that it first reach an agreement with the IMF , and 20 % of a country &apos;s entitlement is actually less than it contributes to the pool . 
This would appear to nullify the very purpose of the arrangement , which is to free Asia from the IMF . 
While there is a plan to raise and then eliminate the 20 % threshold , this is left to some future , unspecified date . 
The reason for the contradiction is straightforward . 
Countries putting money on the barrelhead want assurances that their resources will not be used frivolously , and they want to know that they will be repaid . 
But regional neighbors find it hard to criticize one another &apos;s policies and demand course corrections . 
Political sensitivities run especially high in Asia . 
Even in Europe , with its long history of cooperation , surveillance and conditionality are outsourced to the IMF . 
Revealingly , the Fund , not the European Union , has taken the lead in negotiating emergency assistance packages for Hungary and Latvia . 
Delinking the CMIM from the IMF will require Asian countries to undertake hard-hitting reviews of one another &apos;s policies and to demand difficult policy adjustments . 
Here ASEAN + 3 talks the talk . 
Its May agreement included a commitment to establish a regional surveillance unit . 
But there is no agreement on where to situate it or how to staff it . 
It could be placed within ASEAN &apos;s Secretariat in Jakarta . 
It could be placed inside the Asian Development Bank in Manila . 
It could be given to the &quot; neutral &quot; Northeast Asian country , Korea . 
The outcome matters - which is why governments are fighting over it . 
Recall how the fateful decision to situate the IMF in Washington , DC enhanced the influence of the US Treasury just down the street . 
These dilemmas can be finessed by giving both surveillance responsibilities and the actual power to disburse funds to an independent board insulated from national politics . 
Its members , with statutory independence and long terms in office , could function like the monetary policy committee of a central bank . 
They could issue a Financial Stability Report that bluntly flags weak policies and financial vulnerabilities . 
And they could demand policy adjustments as a condition for disbursing funds . 
The IMF could then be shown the door . 
This scheme wouldn &apos;t solve all of Asia &apos;s problems . 
But it would at least head off one danger , namely the urge to accumulate even more reserves . 
Recent volatility reinforces this temptation . 
If Asian countries succumb , global imbalances and all their associated problems will return . 
Pooling regional reserves as a way of making them go further is a better alternative . 
But making this vision a reality requires further bold thinking .
