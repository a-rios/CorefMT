The Great War &apos;s End in Syria 
NEW DELHI - As the West begins to gear up for the centenary of the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , the Middle East is being convulsed as never before by the legacy of the Ottoman Empire &apos;s breakup . 
Look no farther than Syria , where one part of that legacy - the Sykes-Picot Agreement , which divided the Levant into British and French spheres of influence even while the Great War still raged - is coming to a brutally violent end . 
Likewise , the current turmoil in Turkey is , at least in part , a consequence of &quot; neo-Ottoman &quot; overreach by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s government . 
In seeking to establish the type of regional influence that Turks have not had since Kemal Atatürk founded the Republic of Turkey , Erdoğan has fallen prey to some of the Ottoman regime &apos;s hubris . 
The Levant has , of course , been the scene of countless conflicts through the centuries . 
Sir Archibald Wavell , one of Britain &apos;s greatest World War II generals and the penultimate Viceroy of India , wrote in his biography of the WWI Field-Marshal Edmund Allenby , who led the Allies in the Levant : &quot; The greatest exploit in the history of horsed cavalry , and possibly their last success on a large scale , had ended within a short distance of the battlefield of Issus , where Alexander the Great first showed how battles could be won . &quot; 
But peace still eludes the Levant . 
As Middle East analyst Murtaza Hussain recently observed : &quot; Syria and Iraq , formerly unified Arab states formed after the defeat of their former Ottoman rulers , exist today only in name . &quot; 
What will emerge could be a fragmented , easily manipulated region . 
This is why Syria &apos;s civil war is now a geopolitical battle for regional domination , with multiple fractures along sectarian lines . 
As is now clear , no country is really free of the charge of interfering in Syria . 
While Shia-majority Iraq has attempted to portray itself as neutral , it has permitted Iranian flights to use its airspace to carry weapons to President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime . 
Iran , too , has long used its alliance with Syria to pursue its interests in the Levant , which include support for Hezbollah in Lebanon . 
On the ground , Hezbollah , now openly fighting in Syria to keep Assad in power , asserts that &quot; war is coming to Aleppo , &quot; the ancient city that is the heart of the anti-Assad rebellion . 
Indeed , according to Lakhdar Brahimi , who serves as Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the Arab League for Syria , there are an estimated 148 groups , big and small , fighting in the country . 
Meanwhile , Saudi Arabia and Qatar - which Middle East commentator Saeed Naqvi has called the &quot; most vulnerable Sunni Kingdoms &quot; - attempt &quot; to divert popular discontent along sectarian , Shia-Sunni lines . &quot; 
This ancient fracture , papered over by Sir Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot 97 years ago in their secret agreement , has now swallowed Syria , with Assad portrayed as some sort of Alawite ogre . 
Many Western diplomats appear to be of the same superficial cast of mind as Sykes and Picot , believing that Assad &apos;s fall from power would remove Syria from the Iran-Hezbollah-Hamas axis . 
But will it ? 
And who or what will replace Assad ? 
Surely not the ragtag groups fighting Assad &apos;s regime , even if the United States now supplies some of them with arms , as President Barack Obama &apos;s administration recently announced . 
Recent history suggests just how malleable the elements in play in Syria really are . 
Consider Saudi Arabia &apos;s actions there . 
As Bruce Riedel , an ex-CIA analyst and former National Security Council member , recently noted , &quot; Ironically , &#91; Saudi intelligence chief Prince &#93; Bandar was crucial to the transition in Syria from Hafez Assad to Bashar back in 2000 , assuring key Alawite generals , then in the regime , that Bashar was up to the job and had Saudi support . &quot; 
Now the same Prince Bandar &quot; is trying to get arms to the Sunni rebels to oust Bashar . &quot; 
Such long-term unpredictability is why the former European Union foreign-policy high representative Javier Solana and former NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer assert that talks in Geneva are the only viable way out of the Syrian morass . 
An agreement last month between US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov to launch a new political process for Syria , Geneva II , marked a possible opportunity ; but hope is waning even before the talks begin . 
Indeed , one reason for this is that , on the opening day of the Russia-EU Summit in Yekaterinburg on June 4 , Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed that his country will honor its contract with Syria to deliver S-300 surface-to-air missiles . 
Putin stressed Russia &apos;s disappointment over the EU &apos;s failure to maintain the arms embargo against Syria , thus permitting each EU member state to arm the Syrian rebels . 
Now , with Obama &apos;s decision to send arms as well , his &quot; red line &quot; in Syria - the use of chemical weapons - could well create a legacy as damaging to the region as that of the Sykes-Picot &quot; line in the sand &quot; proved to be . 
To arm the rebel groups is , perhaps inevitably , also to arm their terrorist and mercenary allies . 
That is not a recipe for long-term stability .
