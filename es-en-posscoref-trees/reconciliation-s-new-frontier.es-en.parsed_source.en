Reconciliation &apos;s New Frontier 
In France , May 10 is a day to commemorate the abolition of slavery . 
January 27 is the day we remember the Holocaust , through the commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz . 
In a few days , there will be ceremonies to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the revision of Captain Alfred Dreyfus &apos;s conviction on charges of espionage in a trial that tore the country apart . 
France in particular , but also Europe in general , seems to be in a mood for remembering and repenting . 
It all looks as if the need to integrate communities within nations , to reconcile them with their past in order to unite them around a common identity and therefore a common project for the future , has replaced Europe &apos;s now-completed mission of reconciling old enemies like Germany and France . 
For decades , &quot; reconciliation &quot; and its most remarkable achievement - the Franco-German rapprochement - was the trademark of the project to create an ever closer union in Europe . 
Reconciliation may seem far off for , say , the peoples of Japan , China , and South Korea , but it is taken for granted by today &apos;s Europeans . 
Except for the Balkans , most European nations are at peace with each other . 
The genes of war now express themselves on the soccer field ; competition for land has been replaced by competition for medals and titles . 
The first Franco-German history book was released recently , and , according to its team of writers , it was not the past and the Nazi years that constitute a source of contention between French and German historians , but the present and in particular relations with the United States . 
So , if the mission of reconciliation has any life left , its focus has shifted . 
If European nation-states are reconciled with each other , they are not yet fully reconciled with themselves , with their dark or grey spots , and in particular their treatment of minorities . 
Historians of Europe will probably one day conclude that it is the Holocaust and Europe &apos;s relations with its Jews that paved the way for the opening of this process of repentance . 
In the words of the Polish historian and statesman Bronislaw Geremek , the liberation of Auschwitz on January 27 , 1945 , has to be seen as one of the founding moments of today &apos;s Europe . 
The silence that surrounded Holocaust survivors during the immediate postwar reconstruction of Europe has been replaced by gestures of contrition and reparation . 
Responsibility for passivity as well as active crimes has been recognized . 
Pious lies have been uncovered . 
In France half a century ago , as the Cold War loomed , Charles de Gaulle easily convinced the French that they were heroic during World War II because he was heroic . 
Francois Mitterrand , by contrast , managed to assure the French only that they were not so bad , because he , Mitterrand , had served in the collaborationist Vichy regime of Marshal PÃ©tain before joining the resistance . 
In the eyes of historians , President Jacques Chirac &apos;s redeeming value will most probably remain his courageous attempt to reconcile France &apos;s wounded minorities with their past and the French nation through a national process of repentance . 
It started with the Jews and acknowledgement that the Vichy regime did indeed incarnate the French state . 
Thus &quot; France &quot; itself was an accomplice to the crimes of the Nazi regime . 
Today , France &apos;s black minority is trying to organize itself along the lines of the Jewish minority . 
It has created a central authority serving as an umbrella for diverse organizations . 
And it has concluded that centuries of slavery amount to the equivalent of the Holocaust . 
European recognition of crimes against the Jews , they argue , must be followed by an admission of guilt towards the Continent &apos;s black minorities . 
It is likely that the violence that erupted in the fall of 2005 in many French cities and suburbs , in which young and unemployed black people played a large part , has accelerated the willingness of French officials to come to terms with this historical legacy . 
To face the challenge of integration , France must face its past . 
But it must also behave in a modern , rather than a neo-colonial , way in many places in its former African empire . 
If reconciliation with the past is vital to building a harmonious future , France has much to do concerning another minority for whom history seems to remain largely frozen . 
It is with the French of Algerian descent , not to mention Algeria itself , that reconciliation seems most difficult to achieve . 
It will take more than a few role models , such as Zinedine Zidane , France &apos;s greatest soccer star , to appease the frustrations and to curb the resentments . 
But is acknowledging past guilt only a way to facilitate the integration of minorities ? 
Or is it also part of a process of closing the doors of our European &quot; paradise &quot; to all those who still want to join us ? 
Reconciliation between nations is probably easier than reconciliation within nations . 
This is the challenge facing much of the democratic world today , not only in France and Europe at large , but also in the US .
