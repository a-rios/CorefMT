Bringing the Iran Deal Back Home 
WASHINGTON , DC - The United States government &apos;s initial statements on the &quot; first-step agreement on Iran &apos;s nuclear program &quot; have been focused , above all , on the great deal that the US and the West have gotten . 
Iran has agreed to halt enrichment of uranium above 5 % purity ; neutralize its stockpile of uranium enriched to near 20 % purity ; stop building its stockpile of 3.5 % enriched uranium ; forswear &quot; next generation centrifuges &quot; ; shut down its plutonium reactor ; and allow extensive new inspections of its nuclear facilities . 
In return , Iran will get &quot; limited , temporary , targeted , and reversible relief &quot; from international sanctions . 
The agreement covers only the next six months , during which both sides will try to reach a final comprehensive agreement . 
For now , as President Barack Obama put it , the burden remains , from the US point of view , &quot; on Iran to prove to the world that its nuclear program will be exclusively for peaceful purposes . &quot; 
Framing the issue this way reflects the need to sell even a limited , temporary deal to a skeptical US Congress . 
Israel &apos;s manifest displeasure with the entire negotiating process , which Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has emphasized to anyone who will listen over the past three months , reverberates loudly among Israel &apos;s many congressional friends . 
Indeed , Israel &apos;s stance bolsters the desire of Obama &apos;s Republican opponents to paint him as weak and na√Øve in negotiating with Iran , a country that still describes the US as &quot; the great Satan . &quot; 
Both Republicans and Democrats are threatening to pass a new round of tough sanctions against Iran in December . 
Thus , Obama must focus as much on pushing back against domestic hardliners as on taking a hard line with Iranian negotiators . 
This is hardly surprising . 
One hopes that the Iranian government &apos;s announcement to its own people reads roughly the same , in reverse , focusing on the important concessions that Iranian negotiators have won . 
That includes suspension of international sanctions on Iran &apos;s exports of oil , gold , and cars , which could yield $ 1.5 billion in revenue ; unfreezing $ 4.2 billion in revenue from oil sales ; and releasing tuition-assistance payments from the Iranian government to Iranian students enrolled abroad . 
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani needs to marshal support for the deal just as much as Obama does , above all by reducing inflation and getting his country &apos;s economy moving again . 
If domestic tensions , above all within Iran &apos;s restive middle class , ease as a result , the government will receive the credit , while the Iranian Republican Guard and other hardliners will be weakened . 
The West had better hope that the Iranian narrative proves true , because the political space for any meaningful diplomatic agreement - both the desire for a deal and the room to achieve it - is created at home . 
This is particularly true when a new government comes to power with promises of improving the economy . 
Rouhani can undercut hardliners who would seek to block any ultimate deal only if the Iranian population both experiences economic relief and attributes it to his administration . 
The true test of this interim agreement , therefore , is whether both sides can secure the domestic space to continue negotiating . 
The stakes have never been higher - and not only because of the very real and dangerous geopolitical consequences of an Iranian bomb . 
As Obama put it , &quot; If Iran seizes this opportunity , the Iranian people will benefit from rejoining the international community , and we can begin to chip away at the mistrust between our two nations . 
This would provide Iran with a dignified path to forge a new beginning with the wider world based on mutual respect . &quot; 
Let us imagine , just for a moment , what the Middle East and Central Asia could look like if the US and Iran could once again talk to each other . 
As we saw briefly after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the drug trade from Afghanistan could be sharply curtailed . 
Moreover , a regional agreement involving Iran , India , Pakistan , Russia , China , Turkey , the European Union , and the US would become much more likely , providing the framework for security and economic growth that diplomats from Henry Kissinger to the late Richard Holbrooke always claimed would be necessary for lasting peace in Afghanistan . 
Perhaps most important , a peace settlement in Syria would be much more likely - and more likely to endure - if the US could talk to Iran , which has far more leverage with President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime than Russia does . 
After all , it was fighters from Hezbollah , Iran &apos;s Lebanese proxy , who turned the tide of battle decisively against the opposition this past summer . 
Iran has long made clear that it wants to resume its historic position as a major regional - and indeed global - power , an ambition that can only grow stronger as it watches Turkey &apos;s geopolitical stature rise . 
Iran and Turkey , after all , are the 17th and 18th largest countries in the world by population , respectively , with sophisticated elites and illustrious and ancient pasts . 
The ultimate winner in the interim agreement with Iran is the cause of diplomacy itself . 
US Secretary of State John Kerry , EU High Representative Catherine Ashton , and the other parties to the talks - all supported by able teams of diplomats - hammered out the deal &apos;s details over months , staying at the table , compromising , holding firm , and managing the expectations of multiple players ( including the press ) . 
The Obama administration committed itself to global leadership through civilian rather than military power .
