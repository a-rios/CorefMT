What Threatens Russia ? 
It is fashionable in Russia to disparage our fundamental shift in foreign policy that followed the terrorist attacks on the US last year . 
According to this view , Russia sold its loyalty to the US-led anti-terror coalition too cheaply . 
In exchange for more bilateral and multilateral financing , Russia now faces growing US military bases on its southern flank in Central Asia and the Caucasus , while NATO is poised to expand right up to our Western border . 
But however justified criticism of growing US unilateralism may be - in the so-called war on terrorism and elsewhere - the gravest risks facing Russia lie elsewhere . 
The first concerns the most basic interest of any state : defense of its territorial integrity . 
Here the most immediate threat is not posed by America or NATO , but by the European Union , whose enlargement means that member states will soon surround Russia &apos;s Kaliningrad region on all sides . 
Russia &apos;s task is to ensure that this does not impede the free movement of people and goods between Kaliningrad and the rest of the country . 
This is a vital condition for keeping the region Russian , and special EU transit visas should therefore be granted to Kaliningrad &apos;s residents in order to ensure simplified travel through adjacent EU countries . 
The EU , however , does not want to give Kaliningrad &apos;s citizens such rights . 
A solution must be found , not least because the EU &apos;s attitude to the Kaliningrad problem will be a litmus test of its desire for broader rapprochement with Russia . 
Our mistake was to broach the subject of &quot; corridors &quot; linking Kaliningrad with the rest of Russia . 
Poland immediately associated the idea with the pre-war Danzig ( Gdansk ) Corridor and interpreted it as an ex-territorial encroachment on Polish sovereignty . 
But this is not so . 
We are talking about transport routes for people and goods , nothing more . 
Common sense should prevail . 
The second risk facing Russia is no less daunting . 
Owing to a steeply declining birth rate and falling life expectancy - largely the result of poor diet , widespread smoking , and alcohol abuse - Russia &apos;s population is contracting by nearly a million people per year . 
Little , if anything , is being done to stem the demographic crisis , and it cannot be resolved by a higher birth rate alone ( although this is obviously an important factor ) . 
Moreover , the crisis is aggravated by the uneven distribution of the population throughout Russia , with a near vacuum in the Far East and Siberia . 
A vacuum never survives for long . 
After all , the US gets a million new citizens annually from Latin America , mostly Mexico , and the Italian population grows annually by 90,000 Africans . 
The difference is literally one of degrees - educational degrees . 
When a well-educated , skilled foreigner emigrates to the US , he or she can hope to obtain citizenship relatively soon . 
Foreigners with less developed skills , on the other hand , must work diligently for several years to obtain permanent residency . 
In Russia , we lack any such gradation . 
So we need to formulate , jointly with neighboring countries , a legal framework for immigration . 
Our policy should be explicitly designed to foster a more developed economic and social infrastructure in Eastern Russia . 
Currently , those who want to settle in Russia emigrate overwhelmingly from the CIS countries , and 99 % of them settle in European Russia . 
Unless we equalize conditions throughout the country , the already profound regional disparities will worsen . 
This will require that we accept not only ex-Soviet citizens but also Chinese and Korean immigrants . 
The third challenge that Russia faces - one related to addressing its demographic crisis - is the need to diversify investment to ensure more even economic development , both geographically and by sector . 
Capital that has accumulated in the raw materials sector in recent years should be shifted to manufacturing and infrastructure . 
Currently , only oil production and export benefit from capital accumulation , whereas large sums are simply being sent out of the country . 
President Vladimir Putin recently hinted that Russians with cash in offshore accounts may find their funds frozen pending audits of money suspected of assisting terrorist groups . 
While Russia itself will not freeze accounts , President Putin &apos;s meaning was clear : it would be better for all sides if this money were brought home and invested in the national economy . 
To achieve this end , Russia must create a secure and attractive investment climate . 
Most importantly , if we are to reverse capital flight , the government must persuade individual savers that they can deposit money safely and withdraw it on demand . 
How can the government expect to mobilize domestic investment as long as ordinary Russians keep their savings -  $ 50 billion , according to most estimates - at home ? 
Russia &apos;s people need to be convinced of the country &apos;s political stability - that , for example , nobody will suggest nationalization , as happened repeatedly during the eight months that I was prime minister . 
The model of socialism that existed in the Soviet Union is dead ; even the Communist Party does not seriously question the need for market economic relations . 
But the manner in which the market is established and operates is another matter . 
Unfortunately , central planning was not the only way to deepen Russia &apos;s backwardness relative to the West .
