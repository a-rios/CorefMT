The Nigerian Kidnappers &quot; Ideology 
LONDON - The abduction of more than 240 Nigerian girls has shocked the world . 
Indeed , Nigeria &apos;s torment is shared by many other African countries , and the motivation behind the kidnapping derives from an ideology that is global . 
That ideology is based on a warped and false view of religion . 
It is taught in formal and informal school settings worldwide . 
Of course , the hideous and crazed words of the leader of Boko Haram , the group that kidnapped the girls , are representative only of the most extreme fringe of this ideology . 
Across Sub-Saharan Africa , this problem is now vast . 
Mali , Chad , Niger , the Central African Republic , Somalia , Kenya , and even Ethiopia have all suffered or face acute anxieties about the spread of extremism . 
Many other countries have now identified extremism as their single most important challenge . 
Governments are often confronting the challenge with courage and determination , and the use of African forces in many countries to try to keep peace is a tribute to that resolve . 
But the fact is that the problem is continuing to grow . 
This is not by accident . 
The destructive ideology represented by Boko Haram is not part of the country &apos;s traditions ; it has been imported . 
As the population grows , so will the problem . 
Nigeria has approximately 168 million people today , with some estimates putting the population at 300 million by 2030 , split roughly equally between Christian and Muslim . 
Without a climate of peaceful coexistence , the consequences for the country - and the world - will be enormous . 
Poverty and lack of development play a huge part in creating the circumstances in which extremism incubates . 
Who would invest in northern Nigeria under current conditions ? 
How can local economies thrive in such an atmosphere ? 
This challenge is not confined to Africa . 
The Middle East , as we know , is immersed in a process of revolution and upheaval that has been immensely complicated by Islamism and its extremist offshoots . 
In Pakistan , more than 50,000 people have lost their lives in the terror attacks of the last decade . 
Violence linked to the same ideology has taken innocent lives and destroyed communities in India , Russia , Central Asia , and the Far East as well . 
What is that ideology ? 
Here is the crux of the issue . 
Because misrepresentation follows any pronouncement on this question , let me state some things very clearly . 
This ideology does not represent Islam . 
The majority of Muslims do not agree with it . 
They are repulsed by it . 
But this ideology is a strain within Islam that represents an organized , substantial , powerful , and funded minority . 
What might loosely be called Islamism is based on a politicization of religion that is fundamentally incompatible with the modern world , for it assumes that there is one true religion , only one interpretation of that religion , and that this interpretation should prevail and dominate all countries &quot; politics , government institutions , and social life . 
Those who do not share this view must be overcome . 
This Islamist ideology is a spectrum . 
At one extreme are groups like Boko Haram . 
Other groups may not advocate violence ( though sometimes they do ) but still preach a view of the world that is dangerous and hostile to those who disagree . 
To see what I mean , read the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s statement in 2013 denouncing the UN women &apos;s declaration for , among other things , defending women &apos;s right to travel or work without their husbands &quot; permission . 
It is the ideology , not just the acts of extremism , that must be confronted . 
My foundation , which provides practical support to help prevent religious prejudice , conflict , and extremism , has been active in Nigeria for several years , bringing together Christian and Muslim clerics to foster mutual understanding . 
In more than 20 countries worldwide , we have schools programs that connect children of different faiths to learn about each other . 
Even in the most challenging places , the results are clear and powerful . 
In Sierra Leone , where we are part of the campaign against malaria , we mobilize churches and mosques to work in their local communities and help families use bed nets effectively to protect themselves against a disease that still kills 750,000 pregnant women and children each year in Africa . 
We have reached two million people in an act of compassion and care , with results that are as remarkable as the interfaith cooperation that produces them . 
So the battle is not lost . 
Every year , the West spends billions of dollars on defense relationships and on fighting terrorism . 
Yet the very thing we are fighting is given license to grow in the education systems of many of the countries with which we are engaged - even in our own . 
Education today is a security issue . 
The G-20 should agree that open-minded education that promotes religious tolerance should be a responsibility of all countries . 
We should insist upon it in our own school systems - and then insist upon it in others &quot; systems . 
Nigeria &apos;s kidnapped girls are victims not just of an act of violence but of a way of thinking . 
If we can defeat that ideology , we will begin to make progress toward a more secure world .
