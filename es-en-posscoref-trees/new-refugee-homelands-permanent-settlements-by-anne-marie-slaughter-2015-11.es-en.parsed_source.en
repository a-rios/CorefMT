New Refugee Homelands 
WASHINGTON , DC - Countries across Europe and states across the United States are debating the danger of admitting more refugees from Syria or , indeed , any majority Muslim country where Al Qaeda or Islamic State ( ISIS ) members or sympathizers could slip in with their families . 
This debate misses the point in two important ways . 
First , no evidence yet exists that any of the Paris attackers actually came from Syria as refugees . 
The Syrian passport found near the body of one attacker appears to have been stolen . 
They are radicalized citizens , not fleeing foreigners . 
Second , the world now has 60 million refugees . 
If they were to create their own country , it would be the size of France . 
In the face of such staggering numbers , commitments to take thousands or even tens of thousands of people will do almost nothing to alleviate the misery of millions . 
Rather than conflating the issues of refugees and terrorism , politicians and policymakers should be addressing each separately . 
On the question of refugees , Western countries should take in as many as their populations can assimilate , demonstrating a willingness to make good on the universal values they profess for both moral and political reasons . 
But the world also needs far bolder solutions than twentieth-century approaches like limited asylum quotas and &quot; temporary &quot; refugee camps . 
In particular , it is time to embrace the prospect not of camps but of cities - places where up to a million refugees of any particular nationality can live safely and learn how to build a better future . 
The National Democratic Institute has begun to reimagine refugee camps and camps for internally displaced persons as places where citizens can &quot; find their voice &quot; as voters and participants in democratic processes . 
Rather than remaining concentrations of desperate , dispossessed , and vulnerable people waiting for a day of return that may never come , refugee settlements should be fundamentally reconceived - as hubs of education , enterprise , and equal rights that can anchor networks of relatives and friends that extend back home and around the world . 
Individuals seeking refuge from a toxic and deadly environment could be welcomed not into camps , but rather proto-cities where the &quot; global community , &quot; represented by international institutions , NGOs , governments , and citizens , can encourage hope of a different , more secure life by nurturing positive seeds of knowledge , capital , and liberal self-government . 
Impossible ? 
The Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawaris is currently negotiating with the owners of two Greek islands a plan to resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees and put them to work building homes and infrastructure . 
If multi-millionaires already can buy an island as a vacation destination - through , for example , the website Private Islands Online - why not buy them as a destination for hundreds of thousands of displaced people who could then build the infrastructure necessary for a new life ? 
And why shouldn &apos;t international organizations do the same ? 
Alternatively , neighboring countries could take the opportunity , with enough international assistance , to build cities that would be valuable centers of commerce and education for their own people . 
After all , China is pursuing precisely this strategy , building cities for millions of people to create nodes of economic and social activity across the countryside . 
This approach would enable all countries to be better prepared for and resilient to the continuing flows of millions of miserable and ultimately angry people . 
Today &apos;s refugee camps are often breeding grounds for terrorism , revenge fantasies , and armed insurgency . 
By contrast , cities of stateless people under the protection of international organizations could provide their citizens with the tools for a better life . 
At the same time , we know far more about the radicalized Western citizens fighting for ISIS than most media reports suggest . 
New America , the think tank I head , has compiled a database on 466 individuals from 25 Western countries who have left their homes to go to Syria . 
Last week , researchers Peter Bergen , Courtney Schuster , and David Sterman released ISIS In The West : The New Faces of Extremism , in which a distinct profile of many of these individuals emerges . 
Perhaps most important , the majority are linked by family ties to other jihadists . 
Recent reports on Brussels &quot; Molenbeek municipality as a major incubator of ISIS and Al Qaeda supporters suggest that family and community ties are both important . 
&quot; Hotspot mosques &quot; have long been in the sights of counter-terrorist researchers and police task forces . 
Charting these families , mosques , and suburbs reveals networks that look just like disease maps , tracking the spread of a microbe as it travels along routes where it can infect others . 
Applying epidemiological techniques to finding , isolating , and disrupting the transmission of violence and the radical ideologies that breed it has already proved successful in the US context . 
For example , the organization Cure Violence works with urban gangs and treats violence &quot; like an epidemic , &quot; preventing it by &quot; stopping it at its source . &quot; 
The ideological source of jihadist terrorism may ultimately be in Syria , Iraq , Afghanistan , or Mali , but the source of foot soldiers in the West is communities containing radically alienated youth . 
Frightened populations can all too easily summon images of radical refugees slipping across borders intent on wreaking mayhem . 
Fortunately , taking the time to study the facts in both cases can yield promising new paths to longer-term solutions that balance security and humanity .
