Chávez at Home and Abroad 
Any observer who reads the world &apos;s great international newspapers will probably think that Venezuela is in deep crisis . 
With an oddball president who led a failed coup only to return to impose his brand of Cuban socialism cum Latin American tinhorn dictatorship cum political evangelism , poor Venezuela seems destined for a fall . 
A paradox , indeed , haunts Venezuela : if people abroad have such a poor view of our country , then perhaps we are going to the dogs , regardless of what we see around us . 
Of course , most foreign opinions about a country come from local sources . 
A disproportionate share reflects the narrow group of people who speak English , travel abroad , and belong in the top income group - hardly an unbiased sample . 
The power of the foreign press is worrisome for those with an interest in Venezuela &apos;s welfare , because perceptions affect realities , including foreign investment , risk premiums on debt , tourism and capital outflows . 
Few argue that things are all wonderful with President Chávez . 
Dogged by a small , disorganized , yet wily and persistent opposition that follows his every step and publicizes his frequent missteps , the President &apos;s popularity ratings have plummeted from above 80 % in 1999 to half that today . 
Any government expects its popularity to erode , especially in a society with as many intractable problems as Venezuela : unemployment , crime , high infant mortality and so on . 
President Fox in Mexico , Cardoso in Brazil , De La Rúa in Argentina and Toledo in Peru aren &apos;t doing better in terms of popularity , but they seem better citizens of this globalized world and so are not taking the public beating that President Chávez is absorbing . 
Chávez &apos;s popularity has fallen sharply since September 11 th , both because of his public comments and because of private sector shrieks following the publication of 49 laws issued under special executive powers and after limited consultation with parliament . 
Business exasperation with the President &apos;s highhandedness led to the announcement of a one-day strike on December 10 th , as well as serious doubts over an international strategy that seemed to favor Osama Bin Laden over George Bush . 
Venezuela &apos;s pro-American elites sprouted goose bumps when US Ambassador Hrinak was recalled to Washington for &quot; consultations &quot; about President Chávez &apos;s seeming Castro-style highjinks . 
Who else would have shown Afghanistan &apos;s dead children on prime-time TV , while denouncing the use of terrorism to counter terrorism ? 
If the world is either with or against America , Chávez seems to be on the wrong side . 
Intellectuals may be able to say the type of things he has said and get away with it , not chiefs of state . 
Hard facts appear to support the international press depictions of Venezuela . 
Poverty persists after three years of Chávez rule ; there is a frightening crime rate and homeless children sniff glue on the streets despite a naive president &apos;s oath to house them . 
But is Río any better ? 
The distinction lies in expectations and in Chávez &apos;s own silliness in thinking he could change things quickly with a big stick of good intentions and an army of inexperienced ( and often opportunistic ) followers invading an already pathetic state bureaucracy . 
But other facts speak out . 
Surveys show that only 25 % of Venezuelans rate the government as poor or very poor , even though an overwhelming majority rejects the President &apos;s penchant for monopolizing the airwaves once a week , displacing their favorite soap operas . 
They think he is overly aggressive , creating unwanted conflict , when what Venezuelans want is peace and calm . 
Still , they give him credit - 68 % of them - for having the power to resolve the country &apos;s principal problems . 
It is rarely reported that , after 20 years of inflation averaging 30-40 % per year and with income-crunching peaks set at over 80 % , prices have risen less under Chávez . 
Indeed , inflation was 13 % in 2001 . 
Venezuelans know that GDP has been growing modestly for two years , with private sector growth at over 5 % in 2001 . 
Automobile sales rose 50 % ; employment levels improved slightly , especially in the formal sector . 
After decades of exchange and price controls , the economy has enjoyed three years of open trade , free currency exchange and free prices . 
Stores are full of goods . 
Caracas is no Havana . 
For the first time in history , the government has saved excess oil earnings for the next rainy day . 
Foreign debt is among the lowest in Latin America compared to the size of the economy . 
The National Assembly is negotiating a social security law that may turn out to be reasonable ; a flap over the education law is giving way to agreements among warring parties . 
So why do international financial markets rate Venezuela as riskier than all its neighbors , save for bankrupt Argentina ? 
It is a puzzle here . 
Critics counter that the Chávez government &apos;s &quot; populism &quot; will cede to crisis when falling oil prices take their toll . 
Unsustainable capital outflows bode poorly for future stability , fueled by doubts about Chávez , democracy and the future of capitalism . 
Yet , with government spending at some 22 % of GDP , charges of socialism fall flat . 
These critics say that Chávez &apos;s insistence that the State hold the majority of shares in oil production will scare off investors , even though his Hydrocarbons Law is more liberal than the old one , especially where new gas projects and downstream activities are concerned . 
The Land Law , although it is not very different from the forgotten one on the books for 40 years , is still portrayed as creating conditions that will starve investment in agriculture and cattle farming and marks a direct assault on private property . 
What , then , is the truth about Venezuela ? 
The truth is that the country is facing difficult changes , zigzagging through complicated negotiations among competing and legitimate interests . 
Without a strong opposition , the Chávez government would certainly veer too far left ; without Chávez , it would have no keel at all . 
Equilibrium requires that outsiders not tip the balance of a ship of state already enduring a rough ride .
