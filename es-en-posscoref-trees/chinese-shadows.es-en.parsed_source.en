Chinese Shadows 
NEW YORK - These are interesting times in China . 
A senior Communist Party official , Bo Xilai , is brought down - accused of offenses that include wire-tapping other party bosses , including President Hu Jintao - while his wife is investigated for her alleged role in the possible murder of a British businessman . 
Meanwhile , a blind human-rights activist escapes from illegal house arrest , finds refuge in the United States &quot; embassy in Beijing , and leaves the compound only after claims that Chinese authorities in his hometown had threatened his family . 
Despite exhaustive press coverage of these events , it is remarkable how little we actually know . 
The British businessman &apos;s body was allegedly cremated before any autopsy was conducted . 
None of the lurid tales about Bo &apos;s wife have been proven . 
And the reasons for her husband &apos;s political disgrace remain murky , to say the least . 
Things always tend to get interesting in China before a National People &apos;s Congress , where the Party &apos;s next leaders are anointed . 
Leadership change in most democracies is a relatively transparent process ; it follows national elections . 
To be sure , even open democracies have their share of opaque jockeying and deal-making in what used to be called smoke-filled rooms . 
But , in China , everything takes place out of sight . 
Because leaders cannot be ousted through elections , other means must be found to resolve political conflicts . 
The disgrace of Bo , Chongqing &apos;s former Party leader , certainly falls into this category . 
A handsome , charismatic populist born into the Party elite , Bo was known as a tough official , whose methods in fighting organized crime - and others who got in his way - were often unrestrained by law . 
Bo &apos;s ex-police chief , who is said to have done the dirty work , embarrassed the Party by fleeing to the US consulate in Chengdu in February , after he fell out with his boss . 
Despite Bo &apos;s nostalgia for Maoist rhetoric , he is conspicuously wealthy . 
His son &apos;s expensive lifestyle as a student at Oxford and Harvard has been described in lavish detail in the press . 
In other words , Bo bore all the hallmarks of a gangster boss : corrupt , ruthless towards his enemies , contemptuous of the law , and yet moralistic in his self-presentation . 
But the same could be said of most Party bosses in China . 
They all have more money than can be explained by their official pay . 
Most have children studying at expensive British or American universities . 
All behave as though they are above the laws that constrain normal citizens . 
What was unusual about Bo was his open ambition . 
Chinese party bosses , like Japanese politicians - or , indeed , Mafia dons - are supposed to be discreet in their appetite for power . 
Bo behaved more like an American politician . 
He liked to throw his weight around in public . 
That was enough to annoy other party bosses . 
Since factional rivalry inside the Party cannot be handled discreetly , some of Bo &apos;s colleagues felt that he had to go . 
The way that party bosses , in China no less than in Japan , get rid of irksome rivals is to bring them down through public scandals , leaked to an obedient press , which then fans the flames . 
The appearance of a wicked wife in Chinese public scandals is a common phenomenon . 
When Mao Zedong purged his most senior Party boss , Liu Shaoqi , during the Cultural Revolution , Liu &apos;s wife was paraded through the streets wearing ping-pong balls around her neck as a symbol of wicked decadence and extravagance . 
After Mao himself died , his wife Jiang Qing was arrested and presented as a Chinese Lady Macbeth . 
It is possible that the murder accusations against Bo &apos;s wife , Gu Kailai , are part of such political theater . 
In fact , Bo &apos;s fall from grace involves not only his wife , but his entire family . 
The family must take responsibility for the crimes of one of its members . 
On the other hand , when he is riding high , they benefit , as was the case with many of Bo &apos;s relatives and his wife , whose businesses thrived while he was in power . 
There has been a great deal of speculation about the consequences of Bo &apos;s fall , and of the daring escape of the human-rights activist , Chen Guangcheng , after 18 months of house arrest . 
Will his flight to the US embassy harden the attitudes of China &apos;s leaders ? 
Will it force the US to get tougher on human rights in China ? 
If so , what will follow from that ? 
Since Bo presented himself as a populist critic of modern Chinese capitalism and an authoritarian promoter of Maoist ethics , his natural enemies inside the Party leadership would seem to be the more &quot; liberal &quot; bosses , who favor free-market capitalism and perhaps even some political reforms . 
The current premier , Wen Jiabao , would seem to be this faction &apos;s leader . 
Chen asked him to investigate abuses against him and his family . 
So , could the fall of Bo lead to a more open society , less hostile to dissident voices ? 
It is possible that Chinese Communists who favor more economic liberalism would also be more receptive to a more open society . 
But the opposite could also be true : the wider the disparities in wealth , and the more people protest against economic inequality , the more the regime will crack down on dissidents . 
Such repression is not meant to protect communism , let alone what little is left of Maoism . 
On the contrary , it is meant to protect the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s brand of capitalism . 
That may be why Bo had to be toppled , and certainly why dissidents like Chen , as well as his family , have to suffer so much that refuge in a foreign embassy is their final , desperate option .
