Malaysia &apos;s Opposition Reborn 
In Malaysia &apos;s recent elections , opposition parties managed their strongest showing since the country gained its independence from Britain in 1957 , cutting the ruling coalition &apos;s parliamentary majority to below two-thirds . 
Where the country &apos;s newly invigorated democracy goes from here rests with one man , Anwar Ibrahim , the deputy prime minister sacked by former premier Mahathir Mohamad and later jailed . 
Anwar can finally make the opposition a credible check on the National Front ruling coalition , but knows that he will never become prime minister this way . No one , after all , expects the opposition to win enough seats to form a government in the conceivable future . 
He can allow himself to be wooed back by his former party , the United Malays National Organization ( UMNO ) , the National Front &apos;s leading member . 
UMNO is widely believed to have held talks with Anwar before . 
Now , more than ever , it needs Anwar to reestablish its credibility . 
And , to become prime minister , Anwar needs UMNO . 
Arguably , being inside UMNO and the government would allow Anwar to better institute the reforms he has so ardently advocated . 
But , before all that , Anwar needs to get himself elected to parliament again . 
Because of his prison term , Anwar was not able to run in the latest election . 
Instead , he acted as the de facto leader of a loose alliance between the three leading opposition forces - the Democratic Action Party ( DAP ) , the Justice Party , and the Islamist PAS . 
Political restrictions on Anwar , however , end next month , and an MP from his Justice Party - probably his wife - is expected to step aside to allow him to run in a by-election . 
If Anwar were to marry his leadership and charisma to the opposition &apos;s newfound heft in the federal legislature - 82 MPs , compared with 20 in the last parliament - serious policy alternatives to the government &apos;s might be expected . 
Until now , the opposition has chiefly acted as an irritant , and voters viewed debates as entertainment , rather than as exchanges that informed policy . 
For the same reason , policy platforms have never been important for the opposition in elections . 
Many who voted for the DAP on Saturday , for example , are unlikely to have known or cared about what the party stood for . 
Traditionally , people voted for the DAP or the Justice Party to show their displeasure with the National Front . 
Indeed , if ideas were important , a leftist party like the DAP would have found it difficult to cooperate with the PAS . 
All this changes now that the National Front no longer has a two-thirds majority - which had allowed it to amend the constitution 40 times in 50 years . 
Parliament now will have to pay attention to any serious policy that the opposition proposes . 
But serious opposition will require serious leadership . 
Strong leadership also is needed to protect the interests of the five states in which the opposition has now won control for the first time . 
Because the federal government disburses fiscal allocations to Malaysia &apos;s 13 states , the government will be tempted to squeeze opposition-held states . 
Thus , they will need strong advocacy at the federal level to ensure they receive their fair due . 
What makes the National Front &apos;s loss particularly dramatic has been its defeat in the state legislatures of Penang , Selangor , Perak , and Kedah - large states with important industrial bases . 
( Kelantan state , however , was always expected to continue to be held by PAS . ) 
Urban and middle-class voters such as those in Penang - a predominantly Chinese state with strong opposition sentiment - had always voted to keep the state legislature under the National Front in order to ensure continued funding , while sending opposition candidates to parliament to &quot; pester &quot; the National Front there . 
This calculation has been abandoned , reflecting deep dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi &apos;s administration and impatience for change . 
Malaysia is now at a crossroads . 
For five decades , its democracy has not been premised on a daily test of ideas - whether between political parties or through grassroots engagement - that is then confirmed at the ballot box . 
There is still a newfound opportunity to improve governance , but only Anwar has the experience to provide that direction , because no one else in the opposition has worked in government at such a senior level as he has . 
That said , it is also likely that the UMNO , in its hour of crisis , will try to recruit Anwar . 
Arguably , the best legacy Anwar might eventually leave Malaysia would not be what he can achieve for the UMNO and the National Front , but what role he might play in entrenching a contest of ideas into Malaysian politics - a project he has shown himself keen to promote .
