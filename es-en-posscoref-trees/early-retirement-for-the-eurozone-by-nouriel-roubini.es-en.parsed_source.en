Early Retirement for the Eurozone ? 
NEW YORK - Whether the eurozone is viable or not remains an open question . 
If so , delaying the inevitable would merely make the endgame worse - much worse . 
Germany increasingly recognizes that if the adjustment needed to restore growth , competitiveness , and debt sustainability in the eurozone &apos;s periphery comes through austerity and internal devaluation rather than debt restructuring and exit ( leading to the reintroduction of sharply depreciated national currencies ) , the cost will most likely be trillions of euros . 
Indeed , sufficient official financing will be needed to allow cross-border and even domestic investors to exit . 
As investors reduce their exposure to the eurozone periphery &apos;s sovereigns , banks , and corporations , both flow and stock imbalances will need to be financed . 
The adjustment process will take many years , and , until policy credibility is fully restored , capital flight will continue , requiring massive amounts of official finance . 
Until recently , such official finance came from fiscal authorities ( the European Financial Stability Facility , soon to be the European Stability Mechanism ) and the International Monetary Fund . 
With political constraints in Germany and elsewhere preventing further strengthening of fiscally-based firewalls , the ECB now plans to provide another round of large-scale financing to Spain and Italy ( with more bond purchases ) . 
Thus , Germany and the eurozone core have increasingly outsourced official financing of the eurozone &apos;s distressed members to the ECB . 
If Italy and Spain are illiquid but solvent , and large-scale financing provides enough time for austerity and economic reforms to restore debt sustainability , competitiveness , and growth , the current strategy will work and the eurozone will survive . 
In the process , some form of fiscal and banking union may also emerge , together with some progress on political integration . 
This will require considerable patience from governments and publics in the core and periphery alike - in the former to maintain large-scale financing , and in the latter to avoid a social and political backlash against years of painful contraction and loss of welfare . 
Is this scenario plausible ? 
Just consider what must be overcome : economic divergence and deepening recessions ; irreversible balkanization of the banking system and financial markets ; unsustainable debt burdens for public and private agents ; daunting growth and balance-sheet costs in countries that pursue internal devaluation and deflation to restore competitiveness ; asymmetrical adjustment , with moral-hazard risks in the core and insufficient financing in the periphery fueling incompatible political dynamics ; fickle and impatient markets and investors ; austerity fatigue in the periphery and bailout fatigue in the core ; the absence of conditions for an optimal currency area ; and serious difficulties in achieving full fiscal , banking , economic , and political union . 
If a gradual process of disintegration eventually makes a eurozone breakup unavoidable , the path chosen by Germany and the ECB - large-scale financing for the eurozone periphery - would destroy the core central banks &quot; balance sheets . 
Worse still , massive losses resulting from the materialization of credit risk might jeopardize core eurozone economies &quot; debt sustainability , placing the survival of the European Union itself in question . 
In that case , surely an &quot; orderly divorce &quot; now is preferable to a messy split down the line . 
Of course , a breakup now would be very costly , requiring an international debt conference to restructure the periphery &apos;s debts and the core &apos;s claims . 
A futile attempt to avoid a breakup for a year or two - after wasting trillions of euros in additional official financing by the core - would mean a disorderly end , including the destruction of the single market , owing to the introduction of protectionist policies on a massive scale . 
So , if a breakup is unavoidable , delaying it implies much higher costs . 
But politics in the eurozone does not permit consideration of an early breakup . 
Germany and the ECB are relying on large-scale liquidity to buy time to allow the adjustments necessary to restore growth and debt sustainability . 
Only time will tell whether betting the house to save the garage was the right move .
