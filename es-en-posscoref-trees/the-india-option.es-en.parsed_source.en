The India Option 
French President Jacques Chirac &apos;s visit to India this month to complete the sale of 6 attack submarines to India will confirm once more India &apos;s emergence as an economic and diplomatic powerhouse . 
The &quot; strategic partnership &quot; that both America and the European Union have at times sought with China looks both more plausible and more desirable with democratic India . 
With a Muslim President , a Sikh Prime Minister , a Hindu Foreign Minister , and a foreign-born Christian President of its ruling Congress party , India is as remarkable a success story as the twenty-year boom that China &apos;s Communist Party has delivered . 
Indeed , since 1991 , when a balance-of-payments crisis loomed , India has been shedding its socialist legacies and posting 7.5 % average annual GDP growth - only marginally slower than China . 
India has opened up its economy to world trade and started to privatize many of its state-owned industries ( albeit often too slowly ) . 
High-tech businesses have helped enormously in this effort by showing that India has more to gain than lose from competing in the global marketplace . 
Perhaps for the first time since inventing the zero , India has a hot product to sell - and , this time , it can keep the profits for itself . 
Moreover , a global bidding war has broken out for Indian brains . 
The EU is keen to link into India &apos;s boom . 
The first EU Galileo satellite - intended as an alternative to America &apos;s GPS system - was launched in late December with India as a full partner . 
Also in December , India became the latest nation to join the EU in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) team , which aims to produce electricity using nuclear fusion , as happens in the sun . 
For obvious historical reasons , the United Kingdom has led the way in building EU links with India . 
Indian businesses naturally chose Britain over other locations in Europe for reasons of language and cultural ties , but even that is changing , as Indian investments spread across the Continent . 
In a sense , India &apos;s democracy sometimes hinders immediate growth . 
Unlike in China , India &apos;s government cannot simply ride roughshod over local interests by , say , leveling a village to build a roadway or a dam . 
But this is a sacrifice that India seems more than willing to make to safeguard its freedoms . 
That sacrifice is particularly visible in today &apos;s Congress-led Indian government , which relies on support from the Left Front Communist Party . 
India &apos;s communists ( unlike China &apos;s ) remain ideologically driven , and the Left Front is resisting privatization of state assets , lifting caps on foreign direct investment , and creating a more flexible labor market . 
Yet the essential reforms , which date back to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh &apos;s time as finance minister in 1991 and include liberalization of external trade and dismantling the &quot; license raj , &quot; remain on track . 
It is clearly in India &apos;s interests to join forces with the EU in negotiations within the World Trade Organization to lower protectionist barriers , particularly in services such as accounting , law , and finance , as this will free up trade and generate greater investment flows . 
India already is being treated with growing respect in global economic councils . 
When &quot; new economy &quot; issues such as e-commerce come up at the WTO , India , the EU and the United States often find themselves on the same side . 
On &quot; old economy &quot; issues , ideological clashes have given way to tough-minded bargaining , as has happened in the Doha round of trade talks . 
India supports a Millennium Round of trade talks , but rejects any linkage of trade to labor standards . 
The Indians want faster liberalization of the textile and clothing trades ; the EU wants better enforcement of intellectual- property protection . 
Indeed , India is keen to share intelligence with the EU in the fight against international terrorism . 
The main problem in pushing this strategic partnership ahead lies mostly within the EU , where there is a split between protectionists and advocates of free trade . 
In particular the EU must resist calls for higher tariffs from southern European textile manufacturers , as these businesses have failed to restructure , despite ample warnings over the last decade to do so . 
Indeed , the EU should regard growth in India not as a competitive threat but as a golden opportunity that will benefit everyone . 
The global economy is not a zero-sum game , and the challenge for European politicians will be to explain this to EU members , particularly countries like France that are resistant to globalization and keen on building a &quot; Fortress Europe . &quot; 
Chirac &apos;s visit provides a perfect moment for India to make it clear that strategic partnerships and protectionism ( as seems to be occurring in the French effort to block Mittal &apos;s bid for the Belgian-French steel group Arcelor . ) don &apos;t mix . 
The second point of convergence between Indian and Western interests is one that will probably get no public mention during Chirac &apos;s visit : India can perhaps serve as a counterweight to China . 
The world is beginning to notice that India has nearly the same number of people as China , plus a more benign system of government and no designs on its neighbors . 
China hawks in both India and the West dream that &quot; strategic partnership &quot; will link the world &apos;s great democracies . 
That will not happen soon . 
To be sure , India is as wary of China as some in Europe and America are . 
After all , China supplied much of Pakistan &apos;s nuclear-weapons technology and beat India in a 1962 war ; their borders remain disputed in places . 
Yet neither India nor the EU wants their friendship to be part of an anti-China axis . 
Indeed , India has mostly succeeded in ending the chill that set in after 1998 , when it declared China to be the main target of its nuclear weapons . 
Nonetheless , Europe , India , and America are all aware that today &apos;s friendship could become tomorrow &apos;s alliance if China turns hostile .
