Brigitte Bardot and the Wild Dogs of Bucharest 
BUCHAREST : Perhaps only our greatest playwright , Eugene Ionesco , could have gotten this story right . 
Ionesco &apos;s genius was to portray a world in which the absurd is triumphant . 
Imagine the scene : Bucharest , le petit Paris , a city of three million people with wide boulevards and grand bourgeois villas , stands now a city half in ruins . 
Poverty runs rampant , orphanages overflow with abandoned children , countless packs of wild dogs roam the streets . 
All of this excites little or no interest in the West . 
Romania &apos;s politicians appear to be equally indifferent ; they have wasted the last ten years in endless fights , while our postcommunist neighbors reinvented their societies and made themselves ready for membership in the EU . 
Then Bucharest &apos;s mayor , Traian Basescu , proposes a plan to control the dogs : the city government will put to sleep any dog without an owner . 
Suddenly , the West &apos;s interest is kindled . 
Not to help us , of course - at least not to help the city that contains armies of feral dogs , making it appear at times like a ghost town in a Sergio Leone cowboy movie . 
No , Brigitte Bardot - we still anticipate the arrival of Gerard Depardieu any day now - and other celebrities , people unable to shed a tear for our unwanted orphans or for the mass poverty left behind by Ceausecu , fly into Bucharest ( undoubtedly by first class ) to protect the wild dogs and denounce our mayor . 
Our reality , I suspect , would challenge even Ionesco &apos;s sense of the absurd . 
Middle-aged , greying , Bardot arrived in Bucharest not to remind men , high and low , of her charms but to prevent what she called a &quot; canine genocide . &quot; 
Yet , despite the harsh rhetoric , when Miss Bardot and Mayor Basescu met , they parted with a kiss . 
&quot; For 30 years I waited for this , &quot; the Mayor blushed . 
Unwilling to discriminate between parties , Miss Bardot later kissed our president , Ion Iliescu . 
Her celebrity recognized , the public &apos;s adoration bestowed , she then departed , leaving the wild dogs , and our broken society , to their fates . 
The feral dogs of Bucharest are a tawdry legacy of communism , like the many half-built and abandoned blocs of flats dotted across the city and throughout the country . 
Decades ago , Bucharest held many tiny houses , with courtyards and small gardens . 
People kept watchdogs to protect their properties . 
In the 1970s and 1980s , however , most of these homes were forcefully demolished by Ceausescu . 
The dictator wanted all socialist citizens to live in socialist flats . 
As tens of thousands of people were moved into tiny , standard issue apartments , many dogs were abandoned . 
Like Romania &apos;s people , they survived only by daily cunning . 
Since 1990 , successive mayors promised to tackle the problem of these hundreds of thousands of feral dogs . 
But even bigger problems - housing and street crime - also existed , so nothing was done about them . 
Besides , many people opposed killing the street dogs . 
Every now and then a few were caught , sterilised and released . 
But the packs multiplied and multiplied . 
Mayor Basescu wants to be the next leader of the Democratic Party ( now led by former Prime Minister , Petre Roman ) and is said to be preparing to run for president in 2004 . 
Success as Mayor of Bucharest will boost his chances , and what better way is there for a politician to promote himself than by &quot; cleaning up &quot; some seemingly intractable problem - particularly one that symbolizes ten years of incompetence and despair . 
So , all street dogs , the mayor promised , would be caught and quarantined . 
The old and sick would be killed by euthanasia ; the rest sterilised and vaccinated . 
Meanwhile , people would be asked to adopt as many dogs as possible . 
Those not adopted would share the fate of the sick and old . 
Even before the Bardot visit , demonstrators besieged City Hall in opposition to the plan . 
A human rights defender , Gabriel Andreescu , compared the looming fate of the street dogs with the Holocaust and Gulag . 
A leading journalist , Cristian Tudor Popescu , reproached animal rights defenders for their moral relativism and insensitivity to human suffering . 
Our politicians usually shout at each other , but Basescu cleverly disarmed his critics by talking to representatives from animal rights groups . 
He told them that he rejected cruelty to animals , but insisted that it was his duty to promote the interests of people before dogs . 
He asked them ( many of the representatives were well-to-do women ) to set a personal example by adopting a street dog . 
Ionesco was no moralist , but even he would not deny one moral to be drawn from this story : when societies avoid taking necessary measures , things only get worse . 
For just as the wild dogs of Bucharest multiplied over the years , so too did Romania &apos;s unsolved problems . 
Vast social problems demand an entire community &apos;s commitment , not just resolution from above . 
Of course , you cannot &quot; adopt &quot; abandoned factories or the unemployed masses in the way that dogs can be adopted . 
Nonetheless , a community must and should assume and share its burdens . 
One day , Romania might actually learn this lesson . 
I doubt , however , that celebrities like Miss Bardot will ever recognize the absurdity of their misplaced priorities - to come to a country where millions live in despair and dire conditions , and show concern for only the wild dogs .
