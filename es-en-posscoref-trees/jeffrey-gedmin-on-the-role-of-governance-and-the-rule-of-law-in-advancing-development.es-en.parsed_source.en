Development &apos;s Democratic Drivers 
LONDON - &quot; It &apos;s the economy , stupid &quot; has been a political mantra for more than two decades . 
Nowadays , the phrase is repeated ad nauseam in development discussions . 
There is a wealth of literature describing the various factors that determine prosperity . 
In their widely discussed 2012 book Why Nations Fail , the economist Daron Acemoglu and the political scientist James A. Robinson emphasize the importance of inclusive political and economic institutions . 
According to the economist Angus Deaton &apos;s new book The Great Escape , health is a key . 
The just-released Legatum Prosperity Index points to another fundamental condition for success : good governance and the rule of law . 
As Program Director Nathan Gamester puts it , &quot; It pays to be a democracy . &quot; 
Indeed , as it stands , 27 of the world &apos;s top 30 most prosperous countries are democracies . 
This is not true of the bottom 30 . 
Consider the development disparities in Africa . 
Countries like Botswana that have accountable governments , respect for the rule of law , established property rights , and independent judiciaries fare far better than their counterparts . 
Most of these countries suffer a significant &quot; democratic deficit . &quot; 
In Equatorial Guinea , for example , Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has been in power since 1979 , making him Africa &apos;s longest-serving ruler . 
In just over three decades , his regime has managed to turn a tiny , oil-rich country into a development disaster . 
The vast majority of Equatorial Guineans have severely limited access to clean water , education , and health care . 
Despite such examples - of which there are plenty - there is a school of thought that argues that the clumsy inclusiveness of the democratic process impedes economic development . 
Of course , it is true that democracy is not always efficient - just ask Americans , whose government was recently shut down for 16 days and nearly defaulted on its debt as a result of partisan policy disagreements . 
But democratic systems based on good governance and the rule of law are more conducive to prosperity than any of the alternatives . 
China &apos;s unprecedented economic rise , which has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the last three decades , was a result of economic decentralization and freer , more competitive markets - not clever government planning , as some like to claim . 
China &apos;s future will almost certainly be characterized by more democracy and a strengthening of the rule of law - the country &apos;s emerging middle class will see to that . 
This shift will prove vital to consolidating and building upon economic gains . 
Similarly , in Latin America , the consolidation of democratic government over the last three decades has progressed in lock-step with economic development . 
Chile , Costa Rica , and Uruguay all have positive stories to tell in this year &apos;s Prosperity Index . 
The fact is that when governance is effective and the rule of law is strong , good things start to happen in other areas , including the economy . 
Botswanans , for example , report high levels of confidence in their country &apos;s elections ( 83 % , compared to the Sub-Saharan regional average of just 47 % ) and judicial system ( 83 % , compared to 53 % ) . 
And , lo and behold , progress is being made in several crucial areas . 
Mobile-phone ownership in Botswana has nearly doubled in the last couple of years . 
( Can you imagine a thriving economy without modern communications ? ) 
And Botswana &apos;s success in reducing business start-up costs since 2010 has given entrepreneurs the confidence to borrow money , hire more employees , and take calculated risks on their way to success . 
While there is no one-size-fits-all recipe for prosperity , it is apparent that establishing well-managed systems guided by democratic principles is a particularly effective route to progress in crucial areas like education , health care , security , and regulation . 
By highlighting the factors that correlate with success , the Legatum Prosperity Index should spur policymakers and citizens to reconsider their priorities . 
If they glean only one insight from this year &apos;s index , it should be this : &quot; It &apos;s governance and the rule of law , stupid . &quot;
