Germany &apos;s Secret Credit Addiction 
LONDON - With recent data showing that German exports fell 5.8 % from July to August , and that industrial production shrank by 4 % , it has become clear that the country &apos;s unsustainable credit-fueled expansion is ending . 
After all , German household and company debt has fallen as a share of GDP for 15 years , and public debt , too , is now on a downward path . 
&quot; What credit-fueled expansion ? &quot; they might ask . 
The answer lies in the reality of our interconnected global economy , which for decades has depended on unsustainable credit growth and now faces a severe debt overhang . 
Before the 2008 financial crisis hit , the ratio of private credit to GDP grew rapidly in many advanced economies - including the United States , the United Kingdom , and Spain . 
Those countries also ran current-account deficits , providing the demand that allowed China and Germany to enjoy export-led expansion . 
The ratio of Irish and Spanish public debt to GDP , to cite two examples , fell significantly . 
But the overall advanced-economy debt / GDP ratio , including public and private debt , grew from 208 % in 2001 to 236 % by 2008 . 
Credit growth fueled asset-price increases and further credit growth , in a self-reinforcing cycle that persisted until the bubble burst and confidence collapsed . 
Faced with falling asset prices , households and companies then attempted to deleverage . 
The ratio of household debt to GDP in the US has indeed fallen - by 15 % since 2009 . 
Private deleveraging depressed the economy as households cut consumption and businesses cut investment . 
Tax revenues fell and social expenditures rose . 
Fiscal deficits therefore soared . 
As a result , for every percentage reduction in private debt , the ratio of public debt to GDP rose by a greater amount . 
This was a repeat of Japan &apos;s experience over the last 25 years . 
After the country &apos;s 1980s credit boom went bust , large fiscal deficits were essential to prevent a severe depression . 
Leverage shifted not only from private to public sectors , but also among countries . 
From 2002 to 2008 , China &apos;s total debt / GDP ratio was relatively stable and below 150 % . 
It is now around 250 % . 
This was the deliberately chosen policy response to deleveraging in advanced economies . 
Fearing that post-crisis recession in advanced economies would produce a socially dangerous decline in Chinese employment , the government instructed its banks to open the credit floodgates , triggering an infrastructure and housing-construction boom . 
Commodity and capital goods producers - such as Germany - benefited from credit-driven demand . 
Household and company debt grew rapidly in many other emerging markets as well . 
Overall emerging-market debt has grown from 114 % to 151 % of GDP , and total global leverage is 37 % higher than it was in 2008 . 
As the recent 16th Geneva Report on the Global Economy puts it , &quot; Deleveraging ? 
What deleveraging ? &quot; 
Today &apos;s total debt level seems both unsustainable and impossible to reduce without depressing the economy . 
Eurozone rules demand fiscal consolidation , but the result is slow growth , which makes deleveraging even more difficult . 
Likewise , Japan raised its consumption tax in April to cut the fiscal deficit , but the increase has tipped the economy into recession . 
China now faces the dilemma that arises in the late stage of any credit boom . 
Faced with falling property prices and credit growth , should it accept a hard landing as inevitable , or keep the boom going , which would undoubtedly lead to bigger problems later ? 
Whatever its choice , growth will slow significantly , and inflation already is well below the central bank &apos;s 4 % target . 
Slower growth in major markets in turn depresses Germany , until recently , the eurozone economy &apos;s only strong motor . 
With global growth anemic and inflationary expectations falling , further growth in debt looks unsustainable . 
This poses two questions to which orthodox economics and conventional policy have provided an inadequate response . 
First , how can we ensure that economies grow without rapid private credit growth , which leads to crisis and a debt overhang ? 
Second - and the crucial issue today - how can we escape the debt trap in which past credit growth has left us ? 
As the International Monetary Fund &apos;s latest Global Financial Stability Report warns , relying solely on ultra-easy monetary policy is dangerous . 
It encourages excessive financial risk-taking , increases inequality , and can work only by regenerating the rapid private credit growth that got us into this mess in the first place . 
Relying on competitive exchange rates , meanwhile , is collectively impossible . 
The Bank of Japan considers a weak yen crucial to its quantitative easing strategy . 
The European Central Bank hopes that negative interest rates will help drive the euro down . 
But the whole world cannot devalue against other planets . 
If all countries except the US devalue , the US economy will face the deflationary impact of their attempted deleveraging . 
We need to stimulate growth and increase inflation without generating higher private or public leverage . 
The only way to do that is to run increased fiscal deficits , permanently financed by central-bank money . 
Otherwise , the world will either become mired in deflation and slow growth , or will need to accept further increases in leverage - thereby simply postponing the problem and making it still more intractable . 
The end of Germany &apos;s credit-fueled expansion has now made that choice clear .
