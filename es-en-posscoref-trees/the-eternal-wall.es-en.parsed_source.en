The Eternal Wall 
PARIS - Walls designed to keep people in or out - whether they are in Berlin , Nicosia , Israel , or Korea - are always the product of fear : East German leaders &quot; fear of a mass exodus by their citizens seeking freedom and dignity ; 
To freeze a fragile status quo , to consolidate one &apos;s position , or to remain separate from others perceived as temptations or threats ( or both ) - such have always been the goals of politicians who build walls . 
Why is there such a difference between the fate of Berlin - now a capital city where the progress of the present is slowly covering the many scars of the past - and the fate of Nicosia , where time has been frozen , or that of Israel , whose &quot; security wall &quot; is expanding like a fresh scar , not to mention the North Korean regime &apos;s unlikely consolidation behind its walls of paranoia and oppression ? 
To understand these different situations , one must consider the will of people to destroy their walls in the case of East Germany , to expand them in the case of Israel , and to freeze them in the case of Cyprus and the government of North Korea . 
Of course , the qualities - or lack of them - of the respective leaders are also an important factor . 
The Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989 much more rapidly than most West Germans would have dreamed ( or dreaded ) . 
They had underestimated the strength of &quot; German national feeling &quot; in the East . 
Above all , Mikhail Gorbachev will remain the man who had the vision and the courage not to oppose the course of history . 
He may not have fully understood what was happening before his eyes and the forces that he had unleashed , but his restraint constitutes true greatness . 
The miracle of today &apos;s reunified Berlin is a challenge - even a provocation - to all walls . 
It is proof that in a globally interdependent world , walls are unnatural and artificial - and thus doomed . 
Yet the truth is far more complex , for walls are a multilayered reality , and it is always dangerous to rewrite history in a Manichean manner , while confusing the realities of the past with those of the present . 
Nicosia , the divided capital of Cyprus , is the perfect antithesis to Berlin , and as such the best illustration of what happens when history does freeze . 
There , empty windows filled with sandbags continue to face each other defiantly , symbols of a past that has not passed for decades . 
Of course , crossing the Green Line that separates the Greek and Turkish parts of the city is nothing like crossing Berlin &apos;s infamous Checkpoint Charlie . 
It is no longer a traumatic experience , just a bureaucratic hassle . 
East Germans wanted to unify the German state for the sake of the unity of their nation : &quot; We are one people &quot; was their motto . 
Are Greek Cypriots seriously interested in reunifying their island ? 
Do they wish to extend to the Turkish Northern Cyprus the evident benefits that they derive from membership in the European Union , which came in 2004 ? 
Most likely , they do not . 
As for Turkey &apos;s government , its official priority remains its own entry into the EU . 
It cannot say loud and clear that it is not seriously interested in the fate of Cyprus , but that is probably not far from the truth . 
In any case , the two sides have wasted so many opportunities in the past decades - owing in part to leaders characterized by what might best be described as &quot; competitive mediocrity &quot; - that it is difficult to see a miracle in the horizon . 
Israel is closer to Nicosia than to Berlin , not only in geographic but also in political terms , because successive Israeli and Palestinian leaders have likewise failed to demonstrate qualities of vision and imagination . 
A wall is a bad international symbol , especially at the time when the fall of the Berlin Wall is being commemorated . 
It is also a symbol of futility , because it does not constitute a viable long-term solution . 
But the situation is unfortunately more complex . 
As time goes by , Israelis and Palestinians increasingly want to divorce themselves from each other . 
Israel &apos;s wall constitutes a sad but probably inevitable component of its security . 
What must be discussed is the security wall &apos;s unnecessary and aggressive geography , accompanied by the provocation of further Israeli settlements on the West Bank , not the principle that stands behind it . 
After all , security alternatives that would prevent further bloodshed at the time of the Second Intifada did not exist . 
Ultimately , &quot; walls &quot; represent the realities that lay behind their construction - realities that , unfortunately , later generations may be unable or unwilling to change .
