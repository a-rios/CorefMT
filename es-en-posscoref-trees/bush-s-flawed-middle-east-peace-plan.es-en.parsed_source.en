Bush &apos;s Flawed Middle East Peace Plan 
That a summit in Damascus of the Middle East &apos;s &quot; axis of evil &quot; - Iran , Hezbollah , Syria , and Hamas - was convened immediately following President George W. Bush &apos;s call for a conference of &quot; moderates &quot; to promote an Israeli-Palestinian peace demonstrates once again how intertwined the region &apos;s problems are . 
The Damascus meeting reflects Iran &apos;s view of Israeli-Arab peace as a major strategic threat , because it would condemn it to isolation in a hostile Arab environment free of its conflict with Israel . 
The Iranians also sought the meeting to forge an alliance against a possible US attack on their country &apos;s nuclear installations . 
America has always known that the Middle East &apos;s problems are interconnected , but for years it got its priorities wrong , because it failed to see that if there was an Archimedean point to the Middle East problem , it was to be found in the Palestinian issue , not the &quot; War on Terror , &quot; Iraq , or the need for Arab democracy . 
It took Bush six years of wrongheaded policies to finally admit that &quot; Iraq is not the only pivotal matter in the Middle East . &quot; 
Bush &apos;s initiative is a last-ditch effort to salvage America &apos;s position in a region where it is on the defensive on all fronts . 
It is especially ironic that , in stark contrast to his own rhetoric , Bush &apos;s call for a Middle East peace conference is a call to wage war against the party , Hamas , that won a democratic election , and to make peace with the loser , Fatah . 
Nevertheless , Bush &apos;s initiative is not devoid of virtue . 
He has finally acknowledged the failure of the &quot; road map , &quot; and hence the need to skip interim stages and move directly to a final settlement between Israelis and Palestinians . 
Moreover , both he and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice were unusually blunt in warning Israel that its future does not lie in &quot; continued occupation of the West Bank . &quot; 
Bush also came as close as he could to endorsing former President Bill Clinton &apos;s peace plan by affirming that &quot; the borders of the past , the realities of the present , and agreed changes &quot; will define his two-state solution . 
But Bush &apos;s strategy suffers from serious inconsistencies . 
The conference ground rules exclude radical forces - Syria and Hamas - thus encouraging them to persist in their role as spoilers . 
It is a fantasy to believe that peace can be concluded without the radicals &quot; participation . 
As long as Hamas and Syria are left out of the United States-led peace process , they are condemned to Iran &apos;s orbit . 
The Saudis certainly have an interest in supporting this last ditch American attempt for an Israeli-Palestinian peace , especially now that , for the first time ever , Israel has refrained from opposing an arms deal between the US and Saudi Arabia . 
The common fear of Iran is a major consideration here . 
However , Saudi Arabia &apos;s willingness to participate in the conference might come with a price too high for Israel to pay : an endorsement of the Saudi peace initiative . 
This is the reason Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was cautious in her reaction to the Saudis &quot; ambiguous acceptance of their invitation to attend the conference . 
Bush was right to call on friendly Arab states to contribute to an Israeli-Palestinian peace . 
But how much leverage can he apply when they are so badly needed for his &quot; War on Terror &quot; and for containing Iran ? 
Though certainly a welcome new idea , Bush &apos;s call for Egypt and Jordan to replace Israel as the gateway for Palestinian exports is most likely to be resisted . 
For these &quot; moderate &quot; American allies , peace is about Israeli concessions , not about pulling Israel &apos;s chestnuts out of the fire , certainly as long as it refuses to endorse the Arab peace plan . 
The current American initiative sounds reasonable , but it is essentially unrealistic . 
Tony Blair , the new envoy of the Quartet ( the US , the European Union , the United Nations , and Russia ) , has called for a &quot; conference with substance . &quot; 
But Israel will be required to engage in peace talks only if the Palestinians crack down on terrorism - that is , risk another Fatah-Hamas civil war - and eliminate corruption . 
Such a sequence - and a conference whose harmless aim is &quot; to review progress toward building Palestinian institutions , look for ways to support further reforms , and support the effort going on between the parties &quot; - fits perfectly with the Israeli view . 
But Palestinian militias have shown time and again that they will not give up the armed struggle before they see a Palestinian state along the lines of the 1967 borders , with Arab Jerusalem as its capital . 
This is the fundamental pitfall of a strategy based on driving a wedge between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s &quot; moderates &quot; and Hamas &apos;s &quot; extremists . &quot; 
If Abbas is to prevail , it will not be through &quot; gestures &quot; or a process focusing on &quot; institution building , &quot; however important these may be . 
Nothing less than a full-fledged peace agreement that meets the fundamental aspirations of Palestinian nationalism is likely to give him the popular legitimacy needed to confront the radicals .
