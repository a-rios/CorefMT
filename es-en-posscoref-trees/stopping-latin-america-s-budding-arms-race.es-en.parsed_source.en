Stopping Latin America &apos;s Budding Arms Race 
In recent weeks , many observers of the Latin American military situation have detected what could be the beginning of a new arms race in the region . 
Brazilian President Luis Inacio &quot; Lula &quot; da Silva was photographed boarding the Tikuna , his country &apos;s first conventional , domestically built submarine . 
He used the opportunity to highlight his support for the Brazilian military . 
Similarly , Venezuela &apos;s President Hugo Chávez has broadcast his intention to purchase Russian Mig fighter jets and Brazilian low-flying surveillance aircraft , and to expand military expenditures . 
He is doing so , perhaps , because of recent problems with Colombia . 
Even Chile , after a lengthy process of weighing its options , is still pondering whether to acquire a dozen American-built jet fighters or a joint Swedish-Brazilian alternative . 
Is there a new arms race underway in Latin America ? 
If so , is there any conceivable way it could help address the hemisphere &apos;s economic and social dilemmas ? 
Regional wars and border conflicts have existed since time immemorial in Latin America . 
There was the Chaco war and the Chilean-Bolivian conflagration in the nineteenth century , the so called &quot; Soccer War &quot; between Honduras and El Salvador in the 1960 &quot; s , the clash between Ecuador and Peru in the 1980 &quot; s , and Antarctic border disputes between Chile and Argentina that were finally settled in the early 1990 &quot; s . 
But the main reason for heavy military spending in Latin America has always been chiefly domestic . 
Either the military ran various countries , and gorged itself with hardware and troop increases , or weak civilian governments , terrified of military coups or blackmail , placated their armed forces with all sorts of unnecessary martial goodies . 
By international standards , arms spending in Latina America is low relative to GDP ; but it is nonetheless excessive relative to the region &apos;s needs . 
Today the situation is more complex . 
In Venezuela , keeping his former comrades in arms happy is obviously a concern for Chávez . 
High oil prices allow Venezuela to go on this military spending spree , and there seems little that anybody can do about it . 
In Brazil , matters are somewhat different . 
Lula has been able to neatly dovetail his socialist roots with traditional Brazilian nationalism , which has always been strong in the country &apos;s armed forces . 
&quot; O Brasil , país grande &quot; is a universal slogan in South America &apos;s giant - a country that has borders with nine neighbors and fears that its distant jungle frontiers cannot easily be patrolled . 
Similar sentiments are apparent elsewhere in the region . 
Arias , the 1987 Nobel peace prize recipient , has a good reason for pushing this idea : his country has no standing army . 
Still , it is a bold initiative that should be revived in view of Latin America &apos;s incipient arms race . 
Indeed , it could be the cornerstone of a new program for the next Secretary General of the Organization of American States , who is to be elected in the coming weeks . 
Obviously , I am rooting for the Mexican candidate , Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez . 
Stopping Latin America &apos;s budding arms race is about as good an idea as there can be .
