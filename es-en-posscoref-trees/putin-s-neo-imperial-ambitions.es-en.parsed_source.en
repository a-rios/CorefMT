Putin \ u0027s Neo-Imperial Ambitions 
As Vladimir Putin &apos;s re-election approaches on March 14 , it is time to take stock of his presidency . 
The biggest thing to happen on his watch is that Russia stabilized itself . 
With stability , the face of 21st century Russia was revealed . 
What much of the world sees in Putin &apos;s Russia is a neo-authoritarian regime based on a state-directed capitalism interlinked with the ruling bureaucracy and flanked by an immature civil society . 
In terms of raw power , Russia is clearly inferior to the former Soviet Union . 
This Russia is neither capable , nor desirous of , full integration with the West . 
But weakened , as it no doubt is , Putin &apos;s Russia still regards itself as a great power . 
The ruling elite rejects transforming Russia into a junior partner of the US or an unimportant member of the West . 
As far as Russia &apos;s elite is concerned , Realpolitik in the 21st century is a fusion of geopolitics and geo-economics , with military might thrown in . 
Ideology and values play little role . 
Thus , Putin does not view closer relations with the West as an ideological imperative , but as a resource for Russia &apos;s economic modernization . 
In relations with the US and EU , Putin wants to boost Russia &apos;s status . 
This is what his modernization policy aims to achieve . 
Russian leaders no longer expect real assistance from the West . 
Self-help has replaced the discredited notion that foreign countries will come to Russia &apos;s rescue . 
Foreign investment is still viewed as desirable , but no one attaches primary importance to attracting it anymore . 
Russia , it is widely believed , can rely on domestic capital . 
The same sort of thinking holds true in military / strategic affairs . 
Because America only respects strong partners , Russia will modernize the components of its national power that make it comparable to the US , in particular its nuclear arsenal . 
Overly close contacts with NATO ( let alone membership ) would deprive Russia of strategic independence . 
Of course , confrontation with America must be avoided . 
Russia &apos;s leaders clearly recognize the country &apos;s true current condition , so they accept the need to concentrate on vital interests . 
They remain convinced that Russia is a great power , but one that for now must act primarily as a regional one . 
The major objective of this strategy in the near future will come down to restoring Russian influence in the states of the former Soviet Union . 
Call this strategy &quot; Operation CIS . &quot; 
The objective is not to revive the Soviet Union . 
All CIS countries - with the possible exception of Belarus - will retain their sovereignty . 
When President Alexander Lukashenko departs , Belarus may fold into Russia as East Germany was absorbed by West Germany in the early 1990 &apos;s . 
Russia &apos;s transformation into an economic magnet for the CIS will be the major force of renewed Russian strategic influence . 
In exchange for economic support , the Kremlin will demand political loyalty . 
The criteria for that loyalty will be fairly simple - participating in the security framework headed by Russia and eliminating the &quot; excessive &quot; influence of third parties ( the US , EU , China , or Turkey ) within CIS nations . 
Agreements with the CIS ruling elites will become the main instrument for implementing &quot; Operation CIS . &quot; 
This will require painstaking efforts to promote pro-Russian groups and gradually weaken and neutralize pro-Western circles . 
This task will be lengthy , but the similarities between the CIS political and economic systems with what exists in Russia will make it easier . 
Besides , in most cases , Western integration is impossible for these CIS states . 
Many elites in these countries , because they seized power and became rich rapidly , feel insecure . 
Russia &apos;s support on promising terms may attract them , particularly because the matter of forfeiting sovereignty will not be raised . 
But Russia will encounter problems in pursuing this strategy . 
Putin &apos;s attempt in 2003 to have President Bush recognize Russia &apos;s &quot; special interests &quot; in the former Soviet Union failed , just as Yeltsin &apos;s bid to gain that recognition failed a decade earlier . 
Unlike Yeltsin , however , Putin won &apos;t give up and expects that he can take advantage of the fact that America will be too busy fighting terrorism and WMD proliferation , rearranging the Middle East , and containing China to object too strongly . 
Russian activism in the CIS will also bring it into direct rivalry with the EU . 
If the Kremlin uses force to establish its regional hegemony , Europe may again see Russia as a security threat , which would bring about a renewal of the Cold War / NATO policy of containment . 
Likewise , China might oppose &quot; Operation CIS . &quot; 
Until recently , China feared that Russia &apos;s withdrawal from the region would create a vacuum that the US would fill . 
Viewing the region as its strategic backyard and a source of energy , China is now expanding its influence . 
Consolidation of Russian strategic power would limit the scope of China &apos;s sway . 
In pursuing these goals , Russia must remember that imperialism is expensive and will incite confrontation with the West . 
It must also remember that for the CIS countries , sovereignty primarily means independence from Russia . 
True leaders , after all , lead by example .
