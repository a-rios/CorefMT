Is Global Financial Reform Possible ? 
HONG KONG - Nowadays there is ample evidence that financial systems , whether in Asia in the 1990 &quot; s or a decade later in the United States and Europe , are vulnerable to breakdowns . 
The cost in interrupted growth and unemployment has been intolerably large . 
But , in the absence of international consensus on some key points , reform will be greatly weakened , if not aborted . 
The freedom of money , financial markets , and people to move - and thus to escape regulation and taxation - might be an acceptable , even constructive , brake on excessive official intervention , but not if a deregulatory race to the bottom prevents adoption of needed ethical and prudential standards . 
Perhaps most important is a coherent , consistent approach to dealing with the imminent failure of &quot; systemically important &quot; institutions . 
Taxpayers and governments alike are tired of bailing out creditors for fear of the destructive contagious effects of failure - even as bailouts encourage excessive risk taking . 
By law in the US , new approaches superseding established bankruptcy procedures dictate the demise rather than the rescue of failing firms , whether by sale , merger , or liquidation . 
But such efforts &quot; success will depend on complementary approaches elsewhere , most importantly in the United Kingdom and other key financial centers . 
Strict uniformity of regulatory practices may not be necessary . 
For example , the UK and the US may be adopting approaches that differ with respect to protecting commercial banks from more speculative , proprietary trading , but the policy concerns are broadly similar - and may not be so pressing elsewhere , where banking traditions are different and trading is more restrained . 
But other jurisdictions should not act to undercut the restrictions imposed by home authorities . 
Closely related to these reforms is reform of the international monetary system . 
Indeed , one might legitimately question whether we have a &quot; system &quot; at all , at least compared to the Bretton Woods arrangements and , before that , the seeming simplicity of the gold standard . 
No one today has been able to exert authority systematically and consistently , and there is no officially sanctified and controlled international currency . 
Arguably , the ideal of a well-defined and effective international monetary regime has become more difficult to realize as markets and capital flows have become vastly larger and more capricious . 
Indeed , the global economy , it is said , has grown - and emerging countries have flourished - without a more organized system . 
But what is too often overlooked is that international monetary disorder lay at the root of the successive financial crises of the 1990 &quot; s , and played an even more striking role in the crisis that erupted in 2008 . 
The sustained and , in a sense , complementary imbalances in the US and Asia stand out . 
From 2000 to 2007 , the US ran a cumulative current-account deficit of roughly $ 5.5 trillion , with nearly symmetrical offsetting increases in reserves in China and Japan . 
China found it useful to run a large trade surplus , using a very high rate of internal savings and inward foreign investment to support its industrialization and rapid growth . 
By contrast , the US , in the face of slow growth , was content to sustain exceptionally high levels of consumption at the expense of personal savings , inflating a massive housing bubble that burst with a very large and deeply disturbing bang . 
The practical and inescapable lesson is that when any country is left to its own policy devices , its preferences may lead to prolonged and ultimately unsustainable imbalances . 
Sooner or later , adjustment will be necessary - if not by considered domestic policy or a well-functioning international monetary system , then by financial crisis . 
Not so long ago , we were comforted by theorizing that floating exchange rates would mediate international adjustments in a timely and orderly way . 
But , in the real world , many countries , particularly but not limited to small , open economies , simply find it impractical or undesirable to permit their currency to float . 
We are left with the certainty , however awkward , that active participation in an open world economy requires some surrender of economic sovereignty . 
Or , to put the point more positively , it requires a willingness to coordinate policies more effectively . 
The possibilities include : 
路 
Stronger surveillance by the International Monetary Fund and a firmer commitment by countries to abide by &quot; best practices &quot; and agreed norms . 
路 
Direct and public recommendations by the IMF , the G-20 , or others , following mandatory consultation . 
路 
Qualification or disqualification with respect to the use of IMF or other credit facilities ( for example , central banks &quot; swap lines ) . 
路 
Interest or other financial penalties or incentives along the lines under consideration in Europe . 
But , if approaches that build on past failure do not seem sufficiently effective , perhaps a new approach toward currency fluctuations would be more promising . 
That would require some agreement about appropriate &quot; equilibrium &quot; exchange rates , with a fairly wide band that would allow for uncertainty and permit the market to exert its own discipline . 
But individual countries would orient intervention and economic policies toward defending the equilibrium rate , or , more radically , an international authority might authorize aggressive intervention by trading partners to promote consistency . 
An appropriate reserve currency and adequate international liquidity represent another central concern . 
For years , the pragmatic answer has been the dollar , and to some extent other national currencies , giving rise to complaints of an &quot; inordinate privilege &quot; for the US . 
But it is not in America &apos;s interest to accentuate and extend its payment deficits at the expense of an internationally competitive economy with strong industry and restrained consumption . 
And the rest of the world wants the flexibility afforded by the currency of the largest , strongest , and most stable economy . 
A useful reserve currency must be limited in supply , but have sufficient elasticity to satisfy the large , unpredictable needs that may arise in a turbulent financial world . 
Above all , confidence in its stability and availability must be maintained , which highlights the practicality of a national currency , or perhaps a variety of national currencies .
