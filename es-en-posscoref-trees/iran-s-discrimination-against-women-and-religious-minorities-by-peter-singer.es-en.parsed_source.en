God and Woman in Iran 
PRINCETON - My grandmother was one of the first women to study mathematics and physics at the University of Vienna . 
When she graduated , in 1905 , the university nominated her for its highest distinction , an award marked by the presentation of a ring engraved with the initials of the emperor . 
But no woman had previously been nominated for such an honor , and Emperor Franz Joseph refused to bestow the award upon one . 
More than a century later , one might have thought that by now we would have overcome the belief that women are not suited to the highest levels of education , in any area of study . 
So it is disturbing news that more than 30 Iranian universities have banned women from more than 70 courses , ranging from engineering , nuclear physics , and computer science to English literature , archaeology , and business . 
According to Shirin Ebadi , the Iranian lawyer , human-rights activist , and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , the restrictions are part of a government policy to limit women &apos;s opportunities outside the home . 
The bans are especially ironic , given that , according to UNESCO , Iran has the highest rate of female to male undergraduates in the world . 
Last year , women made up 60 % of all students passing university exams , and women have done well in traditionally male-dominated disciplines like engineering . 
It may well be female students &quot; very success - and the role of educated women in opposing Iran &apos;s theocracy - that led the government to seek to reverse the trend . 
Now , women like Noushin , a student from Esfahan who told the BBC that she wanted to be a mechanical engineer , are unable to achieve their ambitions , despite getting high scores on their entrance exams . 
Some claim that the ideal of sexual equality represents a particular cultural viewpoint , and that we Westerners should not seek to impose our values on other cultures . 
It is true that Islamic texts assert in various ways the superiority of men to women . 
But the same can be said of Jewish and Christian texts ; and the right to education , without discrimination , is guaranteed in several international declarations and covenants , such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to which almost all countries , including Iran , have agreed . 
Discrimination against women is part of a broader pattern of official bias in Iran , especially against those who are neither Muslim nor members of one of the three minority religions - Zoroastrianism , Judaism , and Christianity - recognized in the Iranian Constitution . 
To enroll in a university , for example , one must declare oneself to be a believer in one of the four recognized religions . 
Imagine how we would react if someone tried to excuse racial discrimination by arguing that it is wrong to impose one &apos;s culture on others . 
It was , after all , for many years the &quot; culture &quot; of some parts of the United States that people of African descent should sit at the back of the bus and go to separate schools , hospitals , and universities . 
It was the &quot; culture &quot; of apartheid South Africa that blacks should live apart from whites and have separate , and inferior , educational opportunities . 
Or , to put it more accurately , it was the culture of the whites who held power in these places at that time . 
The same is true in Iran . 
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei &apos;s call in 2009 for the &quot; Islamization &quot; of universities led to courses being changed and the replacement of some academic staff by more conservative figures . 
Two months ago , Khamenei said that Iranians should return to traditional values and have more children - which would have obvious implications for the role of women , quite apart from the environmental impact . 
The international sanctions against Iran that are currently in place seek to prevent the regime from building nuclear weapons , not to persuade it to end discrimination against women or on religious grounds . 
There are no widespread boycotts of Iran &apos;s universities , or of its other products , as there were against apartheid South Africa . 
It seems that we still take sexual and religious discrimination less seriously than we take racial and ethnic discrimination . 
Perhaps we are more ready to accept that the biological differences between men and women are relevant to the roles they play in society . 
So we should not leap to the conclusion that if most engineers are men , there must be discrimination against women . 
That , however , is a completely different question from whether women who do want to become engineers and are qualified to study engineering should be denied the opportunity to achieve their ambition . 
By explicitly preventing women from enrolling in courses open to men , Iran has taken a step that is as indefensible as racial discrimination , and that should be condemned just as forcefully .
