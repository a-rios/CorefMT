Bringing the UK to Europe &apos;s Core 
BRUSSELS - The European Union &apos;s core countries these days , besides the original six founders , are the 15 member states that make up the European Monetary Union . 
They have converging economies and coordinated monetary and fiscal policies . 
The big outsider is the United Kingdom . 
British EMU membership remains very desirable . 
If the EU is to progress beyond the limits of a common economic and monetary policy and develop a defense and security policy along with a common foreign policy , the UK must be on board . 
Exchange-rate fluctuations between sterling and the euro disturb market forces among member states , and at times even have a negative impact in London . 
In the long run , the UK risks serious isolation if the euro zone starts to exert even greater power . 
But other European countries must also understand British arguments in favor of the UK maintaining its own currency , given London &apos;s importance as an international financial center as well as its privileged relations with more than 50 Commonwealth countries . 
The euro zone should therefore offer the UK an honorable compromise in which Britain would be allowed to become a full member of the EMU and take a seat in all of its institutions like the European Central Bank and the ministerial Eurogroup , while also being able to keep the pound in its relations with third countries . 
The euro would , however , have to be accepted as legal tender in the UK , alongside the pound , and in the commonwealth countries , and this would demand close cooperation between the Bank of England and the ECB . 
Such a compromise would increase the EMU &apos;s weight both inside and outside Europe . 
A Europe built around such a core corresponds to what I call a &quot; Saturn model , &quot; with a huge planet in the middle , surrounded by rings , converging sooner or later in the center . 
The outer circles are the transition countries , while the rings around the center would be EU countries that still refuse to join the EMU , or do not yet fulfill all the conditions , like Romania and Bulgaria , or eventually the western Balkan countries and Turkey . 
The Saturn model puts the present fierce debate on enlargement and the borders of Europe into a totally different context , because the core countries would no longer find themselves being asked to accept a Europe divided into different classes of member states . 
The positioning of EU countries on the rings around the core would be transitory , with the aim being to facilitate overall convergence . 
Given the impact of globalization and the direct challenge to the EU implied by competition from countries like China and India , the European economy needs to become more innovative . 
Economic and social reform policies throughout Europe would be strengthened if the EU authorities were able to coordinate them , and EU enlargement , together with the further development of its internal market of almost half a billion consumers , could powerfully stimulate economic activity . 
The accession of Spain and Portugal was a vivid example of that in the 1980 &quot; s , and it is an argument that should be considered with respect to such a populous country as Turkey . 
Europe has been unifying gradually for 50 years now , and we can reasonably look forward to further inter-continental cooperation and integration , not least because of scientific and technological developments . 
At the same time , we can expect a growing Atlantic community as successive rounds of trade liberalization make it easier to develop a free-trade area between the EU and the United States . 
Europe &apos;s own experience has taught us that a customs union must be the first step , and that sooner or later the more intense economic cooperation that a customs union imposes will compel its members to establish an economic community that has all the characteristics of a unified internal market . 
But , of course , this can only function smoothly if exchange-rate fluctuations between its members &quot; currencies have been eliminated . 
Although an Atlantic Monetary Union ( between the US and the EU ) is a long-term prospect , it should be considered as a grand design for the future . 
Europe &apos;s leaders and their voting publics now have a choice between the Europe of the past and of the future . 
The Europe of the past began with the Schuman Plan , which sowed the seeds of today &apos;s EU , and concluded when the Cold War ended . 
It was an era of integration based on the heroic drive to reconcile post-war Germany and France and establish a Pax Europea , as well as the threatened expansion of the Soviet Union . 
But after the implosion of communism , the situation in Europe was more or less reversed : the defensive demarcation of borders has been replaced by the removal of frontiers across the Continent . 
However , while General de Gaulle once spoke of a Europe stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals , defining Europe in purely geographical terms omits other criteria - including the European social model and the scale of values on which it is based - of what it means to &quot; belong &quot; to Europe . 
Instead , the vocation of Europe in the course of the twenty-first century should be to become the lever of step-by-step inter-continental convergence and unification . 
Europe must be reinvented for this purpose , and broadening the EMU &apos;s reach is the right place to start .
