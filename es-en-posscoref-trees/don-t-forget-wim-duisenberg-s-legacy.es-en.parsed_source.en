Don &apos;t Forget Wim Duisenberg &apos;s Legacy 
The most surprising and controversial thing about last December &apos;s rate hike by the European Central Bank was that , after two and a half years of keeping interest rates at exceptionally low levels , the bank ventured an increase of only 25 basis points with no promise of more to come . 
Political pressure on Europe &apos;s central bank may be the reason for that timid move . 
Jean-Claude Trichet , the current ECB president , may be in the same job but not the same environment as his predecessor Wim Duisenberg , who famously remarked , &quot; I hear the politicians , but I don &apos;t listen . &quot; 
Political pressure on the ECB today is much greater than in Duisenberg &apos;s time . 
Some of this pressure may be seeping through and affecting ECB policy decisions . 
This is an extremely negative development Â­ - and one of the central bank &apos;s biggest challenges for 2006 . 
Not only will politicians &quot; influence be towards monetary excess , which of course is a serious enough matter for a bank whose primary mandate is price stability , but also the excess will constitute a serious barrier to structural reform , which is essential for European prosperity in a competitive global economy . 
Increasingly , Europe &apos;s politicians regard excess liquidity and economic reform as substitutes for one another . 
The more the bank gives on liquidity , the less the politicians will do on reform . 
Duisenberg recognized this linkage and held firm . 
The ECB &apos;s paltry rate hike in December , together with the supine promise of no plans for further monetary tightening , demonstrates that Trichet is no Duisenberg . 
Europe &apos;s finance ministers have played a clever game with the ECB . 
Even though they were already resigned to a 25-basis-point rate increase , the politicians made a big show of being opposed to it , aiming to prevent what they really feared and what was certainly more warranted : a 50-basis-point hike and a warning of more on the way . 
Their strategy worked . 
Luxembourg &apos;s finance minister , Jean-Claude Juncker , diplomatically declared after the December meeting that , &quot; The result could have been worse . &quot; 
Indeed , even the markets were fooled , giving the ECB a good grade for its unremarkable rate hike . 
Inflationary expectations , as measured by the rates on certain market instruments , actually fell after the hike , indicating increased confidence that the ECB will keep a lid on price pressures . 
Although the meager rate hike was presented as a consensus of the ECB &apos;s Governing Council , it soon became apparent that the decision had been controversial . 
Some Council members , unhappy with Trichet &apos;s dovish stance at the December press conference , made their displeasure known via the press soon after . 
In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , for example , Bundesbank president Axel Weber made it clear that future rate hikes were very much on the table . 
Others spoke out as well , and the futures markets quickly predicted another 25-basis-point rate hike in March . 
The consensus alleged at the December press conference simply did not exist . 
With political pressures encroaching on the bank &apos;s policy decisions and a faux consensus , it is not surprising that there is now nostalgia in Frankfurt for earlier times and for Wim Duisenberg , even among his former critics . 
Duisenberg &apos;s great skills - under-appreciated by the press and public alike - were genuine consensus-building in a potentially divisive body and , in Trichet &apos;s own words , &quot; an exceptional ability to keep his nerve in some highly demanding and extremely hostile environments . &quot; 
In particular , the stubborn Dutchman understood the extreme danger if Europe &apos;s top monetary authority became too cozy with Europe &apos;s politicians , especially at a time when many EU finance ministers view economic reform and excess liquidity as being essentially the same thing . 
Wim Duisenberg died last year , but his values , philosophy , and wisdom must not be allowed to die with him . 
The New Year provides a perfect opportunity for Jean-Claude Trichet to resolve that , despite the more trying circumstances in which he must operate , his own policies and procedures will more faithfully reflect Duisenberg and his legacy . 
Europe deserves no less .
