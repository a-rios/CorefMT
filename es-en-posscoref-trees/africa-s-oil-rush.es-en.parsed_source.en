Africa \ u0027s Oil Rush 
It takes a threat to oil supplies to get world leaders to pay attention to Africa . 
Usually neglected by globetrotting statesmen , the continent recently saw visits from US President George W. Bush , Chinese President Hu Jintao , Brazil &apos;s Lula Da Silva , German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and many other world leaders . 
Their public comments were typically devoted to development , ending Africa &apos;s many wars , and the fight against HIV / AIDS , but all of them had oil on their minds . 
An oil rush is underway in the continent , because all developed countries &apos; national security depends on a steady oil supply , and sub-Saharan Africa owns 8 % of the world &apos;s known reserves . 
In 2002 production was 2.1 million barrels a day in Nigeria , 900,000 in Angola , 283,000 in Congo Brazzaville , 265,000 in Equatorial Guinea , 247,000 in Gabon , 227,000 in Sudan , 75,000 in Cameroon , 28,000 in South Africa , 25,000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo , and 11,000 in Ivory Coast . 
The US alone imports 1.5 million barrels a day from West Africa , the same amount it imports from Saudi Arabia . 
According to the US Energy Department , within this decade American oil imports from Africa will reach 770 millions barrels annually , as exploration intensifies throughout the Gulf of Guinea , and as the US brokers peace in war-ravaged oil-producing countries , such as Sudan and Angola , and establishes strategic bases to safeguard output . 
As a result , West African oil producers will be earning an estimated $ 200 billion over the next decade , more than 10 times the sum Western countries allocate each year to the &quot; aid industry &quot; in the region . 
So why aren &apos;t Africans celebrating ? 
Because they are well aware of the &quot; curse of oil &quot; - corruption , conflict , ecological disaster , and anaesthetized entrepreneurial spirit . 
In Nigeria , an estimated $ 300 billion in oil revenues entered the government &apos;s coffers over the past 25 years , but per capita income remains less than one dollar a day for the simple reason that much of the money ends up in Swiss bank accounts , like the one owned by the late dictator Sani Abacha . 
In Angola , British Petroleum revealed that it had to pay a $ 111 million &quot; signature bonus &quot; to the government . 
As scandalous as it might be , these sums are mere peanuts compared to the $ 4.5 billions in oil revenues supposedly siphoned away from African government coffers over the last decade . 
But graft and theft are not the only problems . 
The celebrated pipeline between Chad and Cameroon caused water pollution , devastated pygmies &apos; hunting grounds , destroyed harvests , and spread AIDS - perhaps the inevitable result of ill-educated migrant workers toiling thousands of miles from home , with a horde of prostitutes following them . 
Projected annual revenues from this project for oil companies such as Chevron , Exxon , and Petronas , and lenders like the World Bank and the European Investment Bank , are estimated at $ 4.7 billion . 
Chad will see a mere $ 62 million , and Cameroon just $ 18.6 million . 
So petrodollars exacerbate poverty in sub-Saharan Africa , not cure it . 
Only openness and accountability can reverse this trend . 
This was the objective set by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative , which requested that the publication of multinational oil companies &apos; payments to governments be made mandatory . 
Unfortunately , because the companies and African politicians have every reason to avoid transparency , the EITI plans were rendered meaningless when they were not made compulsory . 
What lessons can be learned from this sorry state of affairs ? 
One relates to the defenders of those suffering such obvious exploitation . 
The people who rebelled against these injustices were not Africans , but well-wishers from western organizations such as EITI , the US aid agency Catholic Relief Services ( CRS ) , and Global Witness . 
African intellectuals , artists , and civil rights activists did not feel the need to express solidarity with fellow Africans and to defend the rights of the downtrodden . 
African civil society seems trapped in indifference and inertia . 
Another lesson concerns Africa &apos;s failed political leadership . 
It is customary to link Africa &apos;s failures to slavery and colonization , and no one can deny such claims . 
But this recognition does not exonerate Africa &apos;s &quot; kinglets , &quot; who handed their subjects over to the slave traders . 
Recently , a congregation of African church leaders convened in the Senegalese island of Gor√©e and urged their people to assess their share of responsibility for the slave trade . 
The call went unheeded . 
That is a shame , for here was a moment to expose the flaws of most African leaders throughout our tormented history . 
The constant ability of Africa &apos;s leaders to betray their people is the root cause of Africa &apos;s current misery . 
Their fecklessness and recklessness are what convince much of the world that Africans can do nothing but dance , slaughter each other , and beg . 
Easy access to oil wealth only allows their cynical frivolity to continue . 
If Africa &apos;s oil wealth is to be exploited - and it
