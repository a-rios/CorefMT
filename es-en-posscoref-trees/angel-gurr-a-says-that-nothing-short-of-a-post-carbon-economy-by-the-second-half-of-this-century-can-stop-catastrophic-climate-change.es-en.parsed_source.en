The Zero-Emissions Imperative 
DAVOS - Our planet is warming dangerously . 
And , as the 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes clear , our carbon-dioxide emissions over the past half-century are extremely likely to be to blame . 
A more robust approach to global warming is needed if we are to avoid catastrophe . 
Unlike the recent financial crisis , there is no bailout option for the earth &apos;s climate . 
Three years ago , at the United Nations COP 16 climate-change meeting in Cancún , countries agreed to reduce their emissions by 2020 to a point that would prevent the average global temperature from rising more than 2 ° C above pre-industrial levels . 
However , UN estimates show that current trends would bring the world only 25-50 % of the way to this target . 
This is why I am calling on all governments to be more ambitious - to aim for zero net emissions from fossil fuels by the second half of this century . 
Nothing short of a wholesale transformation of the energy economy will suffice . 
Just this week , the European Commission unveiled new energy and climate targets for 2030 - calling for a 40 % reduction in the bloc &apos;s greenhouse-gas emissions from 1990 levels , with 27 % of energy to come from renewable sources . 
This is an extremely important step , and more countries should follow suit . 
To be sure , we will encounter huge obstacles . 
Two-thirds of electricity generation , and nearly 95 % of the energy consumed by the world &apos;s transport systems , comes from fossil fuels . 
Our energy security is increasingly tied to the exploitation of unconventional fossil-fuel deposits like shale gas , especially in the United States . 
Carbon-intensive technologies remain more profitable than low-carbon alternatives in many cases . 
And cash-strapped governments continue to encourage oil and gas exploration , in part because the rents received by some account for a large part of their revenues . 
But change is possible . 
There is a yawning gap between what governments promise to do about climate change and their often-inconsistent ( if not incoherent ) policies . 
Even when appearing to support greener technologies , governments are prone to sudden policy changes , sometimes retroactively , leaving businesses reluctant to commit to significant investments , or even take official statements seriously at all . 
I believe we can make substantial and rapid progress by setting a clear direction on three issues : 
Put a price on carbon . 
By pricing the cost of carbon , we can manage its use ( or disuse ) . 
More than 40 countries have already implemented some form of carbon tax or emissions-trading scheme . 
Trading schemes are often politically more attractive , because they can be flexible ( although their design and implementation could be improved in many cases ) . 
But we can be bolder . 
Several governments have successfully introduced carbon taxes without adversely affecting growth , and we should encourage more countries to follow their example . 
Cut fossil-fuel subsidies . 
The OECD estimates that fossil-fuel subsidies in member countries amounted to $ 55-90 billion annually from 2005 to 2011 . 
And the International Energy Agency estimates that in 2012 fossil-fuel subsidies worldwide grew to $ 544 billion . 
Most of these subsidies should be scrapped ; the energy industry does not need more state aid to burn fossil fuels ( and , in developing and emerging economies , subsidies are a grossly inefficient and probably unnecessary way to help the poor ) . 
Clarify policies . 
Governments must address inconsistencies in their energy strategies , consider the links with broader economic policies , and stop sending mixed signals to consumers , producers , and investors . 
In particular , they must assess whether the right regulatory arrangements are in place to allow clean-energy investments to compete on a risk-return basis . 
This will be essential if investors are to redirect investment toward climate-friendly alternatives . 
The OECD will play its part . 
In order to understand and compare countries &quot; performances more accurately , OECD Economic Surveys will now include data and analysis of climate policies . 
By mid-2015 , we expect to have a clear picture of the progress being made and the challenges that remain in OECD countries and all major emerging economies - and to have advised these countries how they can realistically increase the ambition and cost-effectiveness of their policies . 
These steps will signal that the price of emissions must rise substantially if we are to reach our goal of zero net emissions . 
The transformation will not be costless , and governments must be frank with their electorates about its social and economic impact . 
But a low-carbon , climate-resilient world will also offer new economic opportunities . 
More important , the alternative - inaction , or too little action - would be far more expensive in the long run . 
Hurricane Sandy , for example , cost the US the equivalent of 0.5 % of its GDP . 
The annual bill for flood protection in coastal cities worldwide is likely to rise above $ 50 billion by 2050 . 
The consequences for developing countries are more dire : Typhoon Haiyan , which hit the Philippines in 2013 , was a stark reminder of how vulnerable poor countries can be to climate change . 
If the world is to avoid a collision with nature - one that humanity surely cannot win - we must act boldly on every front , particularly with respect to carbon pricing and the coherence of our economic and energy policies .
