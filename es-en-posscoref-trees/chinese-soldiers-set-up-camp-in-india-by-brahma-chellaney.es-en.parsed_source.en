China &apos;s India Land Grab 
NEW DELHI - Stoking tensions with Japan , Vietnam , and the Philippines over islands in the South and East China Seas has not prevented an increasingly assertive China from opening yet another front by staging a military incursion across the disputed , forbidding Himalayan frontier . 
On the night of April 15 , a People &apos;s Liberation Army ( PLA ) platoon stealthily intruded near the China-India-Pakistan tri-junction , established a camp 19 kilometers ( 12 miles ) inside Indian-controlled territory , and presented India &apos;s government with the potential loss of a strategically vital 750-square-kilometer high-altitude plateau . 
A stunned India , already reeling under a crippling domestic political crisis , has groped for an effective response to China &apos;s land-grab - the largest and most strategic real estate China has seized since it began pursuing a more muscular policy toward its neighbors . 
Whether China intends to stay put by building permanent structures for its troops on the plateau &apos;s icy heights , or plans to withdraw after having extracted humiliating military concessions from India , remains an open - and in some ways a moot - question . 
The fact is that , with its &quot; peaceful rise &quot; giving way to an increasingly sharp-elbowed approach to its neighbors , China has broadened its &quot; core interests &quot; - which brook no compromise - and territorial claims , while showing a growing readiness to take risks to achieve its goals . 
For example , China has not only escalated its challenge to Japan &apos;s decades-old control of the Senkaku ( Diaoyu ) Islands , but is also facing off against the Philippines since taking effective control of Scarborough Shoal last year . 
What makes the Himalayan incursion a powerful symbol of China &apos;s aggressive new stance in Asia is that its intruding troops have set up camp in an area that extends beyond the &quot; line of actual control &quot; ( LAC ) that China itself unilaterally drew when it defeated India in the 1962 Chinese-initiated border war . 
While China &apos;s navy and a part of its air force focus on supporting revanchist territorial and maritime claims in the South and East China Seas , its army has been active in the mountainous borderlands with India , trying to alter the LAC bit by bit . 
One of the novel methods that the PLA has employed is to bring ethnic Han pastoralists to the valleys along the LAC and give them cover to range across it , in the process driving Indian herdsmen from their traditional pasturelands . 
But the latest crisis was sparked by China &apos;s use of direct military means in a strategic border area close to the Karakoram Pass linking China to India . 
Because the LAC has not been mutually clarified - China reneged on a 2001 promise to exchange maps with India - China claims that PLA troops are merely camping on &quot; Chinese land . &quot; 
Yet , in a replay of its old strategy of furtively encroaching on disputed land and then presenting itself as the conciliator , China now counsels &quot; patience &quot; and &quot; negotiations &quot; to help resolve the latest &quot; issue . &quot; 
China is clearly seeking to exploit India &apos;s political disarray to alter the reality on the ground . 
A paralyzed and rudderless Indian government initially blacked out reporting on the incursion , lest it come under public pressure to mount a robust response . 
Its first public statement came only after China issued a bland denial of the intrusion in response to Indian media reports quoting army sources . 
To add to India &apos;s woes , Salman Khurshid , the country &apos;s bungling foreign minister , initially made light of the deepest Chinese incursion in more than a quarter-century . 
The garrulous minister called the intrusion just &quot; one little spot &quot; of acne on the otherwise &quot; beautiful face &quot; of the bilateral relationship - a mere blemish that could be treated with &quot; an ointment . &quot; 
Those inept comments fatally undercut the government &apos;s summoning of the Chinese ambassador to demand a return to the status quo ante . 
With Prime Minister Manmohan Singh &apos;s corruption-tainted government tottering on the brink of collapse , there has been no official explanation of how India was caught napping in a militarily critical area where , in the recent past , China had made repeated attempts to encroach on Indian land . 
In fact , the government inexplicably replaced regular army troops with border police in 2010 to patrol the mountain-ringed plateau into which the PLA has now intruded . 
Known as Depsang , the plateau lies astride an ancient silk route connecting Yarkand in Xinjiang to India &apos;s Ladakh region through the Karakoram Pass . 
India , with a military staging post and airstrip just south of the Karakoram Pass , has the capacity to cut off the highway linking China with its &quot; all-weather ally , &quot; Pakistan . 
The PLA intrusion , by threatening that Indian base , may have been intended to foreclose India &apos;s ability to choke off supplies to Chinese troops and workers in Pakistan &apos;s Gilgit-Baltistan region , where China has expanded its military footprint and strategic projects . 
To guard those projects , several thousand Chinese troops reportedly have been deployed in the rebellious , predominantly Shia region , which is closed to the outside world . 
For India , the Chinese incursion also threatens its access to the 6,300-meter-high Siachen Glacier , to the west of Depsang . 
Pakistan claims the Indian-controlled glacier , which , strategically wedged between the Pakistani- and Chinese-held parts of Kashmir , served as the world &apos;s highest and coldest battleground ( and one of the bloodiest ) from the mid-1980 &quot; s until a cease-fire took effect in 2003 . 
India &apos;s nonmilitary options to force a Chinese withdrawal from Depsang range from diplomatic ( suspension of all official visits or reconsideration of its recognition of Tibet as part of China ) to economic ( an informal boycott of Chinese goods , just as China has hurt Japan through a nonofficial boycott of Japanese-made products ) . 
A possible military response could involve the Indian army establishing a camp of its own on Chinese territory elsewhere that China &apos;s leaders regard as highly strategic . 
But , before it can exercise any option credibly , India needs a stable government . 
Until then , China will continue to press its claims by whatever means - fair or foul - it deems advantageous .
