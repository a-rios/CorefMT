The Quiet Financial Revolution Begins 
LAGUNA BEACH - Steadily and indisputably , the financial services industry - with which we all interact , whether as borrowers , savers , investors , or regulators - has embarked on a multiyear transformation . 
This process , slow at first , has been driven by the combined impact of two sets of durable forces . 
On one hand , top-down factors - regulatory change , unusual pricing , and what Nouriel Roubini has cleverly termed the &quot; liquidity paradox &quot; - are at work . 
Then there are disruptive influences that percolate up from below : changing customer preferences and , even more important , outside visionaries seeking to transform and modernize the industry . 
Beginning at the top , the regulatory pendulum is still swinging toward tighter supervision of traditional financial institutions , particularly large banks and insurance companies deemed &quot; systemically important . &quot; 
Moreover , re-designed regulatory frameworks , phased implementation , and stepped-up supervision will gradually extend to other segments , including asset management . 
This will contribute to further generalized de-risking within the regulated sectors , as part of a broader financial-sector movement toward a &quot; utilities model &quot; that emphasizes larger capital cushions , less leverage , greater disclosure , stricter operational guidelines , and a lot more oversight . 
The pricing environment compounds the impact of tighter regulation . 
Like utilities , established financial institutions are facing external constraints on their pricing power , though not of the traditional form . 
Rather than being subjected to explicit price regulations and guidelines , these institutions operate in a &quot; financial repression &quot; regime in which key benchmark interest rates have been held at levels below what would otherwise prevail . 
This erodes net interest margins , puts pressure on certain fee structures , and makes certain providers more cautious about entering into long-term financial relationships . 
As a result of these two factors , established institutions - particularly the large banks - will be inclined to do fewer things for fewer people , despite being flush with liquidity provided by central banks ( the &quot; liquidity paradox &quot; ) . 
And banks and broker-dealers can be expected to provide only limited liquidity to their clients if a large number of them suddenly seek to realign their financial positioning at the same time . 
But this is not just about them . 
The impact on the financial-services industry of these top-down factors will gradually amplify the importance of the bottom-up forces . 
Over time , this second set of factors will fuel more direct and efficient provision of services to a broader set of consumers , contributing to a reconfiguration of the industry as a whole . 
For starters , customer expectations will evolve as the millennial generation increasingly accounts for a larger portion of earning , spending , borrowing , saving , and investing . 
With many of these newer clients favoring &quot; self-directed &quot; lives , providers of financial services will be pressed to switch from a product-push mindset to offering more holistic solutions that allow for greater individual customization . 
Market-communication functions will also be forced to modernize as more clients expect more credible and substantive &quot; any place , any time , and any way &quot; interactions . 
Then there is the influence of outside disruptors . 
Jamie Dimon , the CEO of JPMorgan Chase , expressed it well in his 2015 shareholder letter , observing that &quot; Silicon Valley &quot; is coming . 
These new entrants want to apply more advanced technological solutions and insights from behavioral science to an industry that is profitable but has tended to under-serve its clients . 
Airbnb and Uber have demonstrated that disruption from another industry is particularly powerful , because it involves enabling efficiency-enhancing structural changes that draw on core competencies and strategies that the incumbent firms lack . 
Many other companies ( for example , Rent the Runway , which provides short-term rentals of higher-end fashion ) are in the process of doing the same thing . 
Be it peer-to-peer platforms or crowd-funding , outside disruptors already are having an impact at the margin of finance , particularly in serving those who were previously marginalized by traditional firms or had lost trust in them . 
The end result will be an industry that serves people via a larger menu of customizable solutions . 
Though traditional firms will seek to adjust to maintain their dominance , many will be challenged to &quot; self-disrupt &quot; their thinking and operational approach . 
And , while emerging firms will offer better services , they will not find it easy to overcome immediately and decisively the institutional and regulatory inertia that anchors traditional firms &quot; market position . 
As a result , a proliferation of financial providers is likely , with particularly bright prospects for institutional partnerships that combine the more agile existing platforms with exciting new content and approaches .
