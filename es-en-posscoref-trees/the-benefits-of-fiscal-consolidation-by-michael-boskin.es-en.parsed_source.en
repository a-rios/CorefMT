Why Consolidate ? 
STANFORD - Around the world , raging debates about whether , when , how , and how much to reduce large budget deficits and high levels of sovereign debt are dividing policymakers and publics . 
Diametrically opposed spending , tax , monetary , and regulatory policies and proposals are proliferating . 
To consolidate ( the budget ) , or not to consolidate , that is the question . 
The political left clamors for more spending , higher taxes on high-income earners , and delayed fiscal consolidation . 
For example , the economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman proposes waiting 10-15 years . 
( Many of the same people argued for analogous reasons against the Federal Reserve &apos;s successful disinflation policies in the early 1980 &quot; s . ) 
The political right calls for more rapid deficit reduction by cutting spending . 
In Europe , policymakers , including the European Central Bank , demand consolidation for high-debt countries , but are flexible in negotiations ; voters , however , reject it - most recently in Italy . 
In the United States , Republicans propose to balance the budget within ten years by reforming entitlement spending and taxes ( with fewer exemptions , deductions , and credits providing the revenue needed to reduce personal tax rates and a corporate rate that , at 35 % , is the highest in the OECD ) . 
America &apos;s Senate Democrats propose $ 1.5 trillion in higher taxes over ten years ( on top of the $ 600 billion agreed in early January ) , $ 100 billion ( twice that , for House Democrats ) in new stimulus spending , and modest longer-term expenditure cuts . 
Their version of tax reform would mean reducing deductions for the wealthy and corporations , with no rate reductions . 
What are the likely costs and benefits of stimulus versus consolidation ? 
And what is the best combination of spending cuts and tax hikes ? 
Economists agree that , at full employment , higher government spending crowds out private spending . 
Keynesian models claiming a quick boost from higher government spending below full employment show that the effect soon turns negative . 
So it needs to be repeated over and over , like a drug , to sustain the economic high . 
That strategy saddled Japan with the world &apos;s highest debt / GDP ratio , to little benefit . 
To be sure , recent research suggests that increased government spending can be effective in temporarily raising output and employment during deep , long-lasting recessions when the central bank has reduced its short-term policy interest rate to zero . 
But the same research suggests that the government spending multiplier is likely to be small or even negative in a variety of circumstances and , in any event , would quickly shrink . 
Such circumstances include , first , a high debt / GDP ratio , with rising interest rates impeding growth . 
Likewise , during expansions , higher government spending is more likely to crowd out private spending . 
Spending on transfer payments and / or nonmilitary purchases - which can become entrenched or be procured more cheaply from abroad ( for example , solar panels and wind turbines , respectively , in America &apos;s 2009 fiscal stimulus ) - is also likely to yield only a small multiplier . 
And , when the economy has flexible exchange rates , if government spending raises interest rates , the currency will strengthen , leading to a decrease in investment and net exports . 
Finally , the effects of additional government spending may be offset by people &apos;s expectations of higher taxes once the central bank exits the zero lower bound on interest rates ( causing them to spend less now ) . 
These considerations apply to the US and some European countries today . 
Together with poor design , they explain why America &apos;s 2009 stimulus cost several hundred thousand dollars per temporary job created . 
Recent research also reveals that in OECD countries since World War II , successful fiscal consolidation - defined as stabilizing the budget while avoiding recession - averaged $ 5- $ 6 of actual spending cuts per dollar of tax hikes . 
Cuts in spending , especially on entitlements and transfers , were far less likely to cause recessions than tax increases were . 
Unfortunately , tax hikes have predominated in many recent European consolidations , including last week &apos;s proposed Cyprus bailout . 
Of course , caution is appropriate in order to avoid claiming too much for the benefits of short-run consolidation . 
After all , the current American and European economies differ in important ways from the other post-war cases - size , simultaneous consolidation in many countries , already-low interest rates , and the dollar &apos;s status as the main global reserve currency . 
But , other than in deep recessions , the validity of the Keynesian claim that delaying spending cuts is necessary to avoid undermining the economy is at best unclear , and would leave a long boom as the only time to control spending . 
And large deficits and high debt levels decrease the prospects for a long boom . 
Moreover , credibly phasing in spending reductions as the economy recovers is no easy task , given the political economy of the budget and the inability of one legislature to bind the next . 
Worse yet , the cost of delay and increased deficits and debt is enormous . 
For example , without major reform in the US entitlement programs - which are exploding in size as a result of rising real benefits per beneficiary and an aging population - the next generation can expect a 20 % reduction in living standards . 
The most credible reforms are structural - for example , higher retirement ages and changes to benefit formulas - and difficult to alter once they are implemented . 
Merely setting a dollar ( or pound or euro ) target for budget cuts is far less effective , because the target can easily be revised - and cuts reversed - to avoid political pain . 
If there were some short-term stimulus that was timely and likely to raise output and employment at a reasonable long-term cost , I would be all for it . 
But the evidence is that highly effective fiscal policy , even at the zero lower bound on interest rates , remains at best a theoretical possibility , subject to severe political constraints . 
While consolidation may imply some short-term costs , especially in a recession , the long-term costs of delay are large . 
It would be best if a credible consolidation program could be phased in gradually ; but consolidation needs to proceed nonetheless - and primarily by controlling spending .
