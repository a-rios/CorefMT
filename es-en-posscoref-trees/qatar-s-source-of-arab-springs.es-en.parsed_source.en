Qatar &apos;s Source of Arab Springs 
CAMBRIDGE - There &apos;s a joke making the rounds in the Middle East these days : three of Egypt &apos;s former presidents , Gamal Abdel Nasser , Anwar el-Sadat , and Hosni Mubarak , meet in hell and ask each other how they fell . 
Nasser replies &quot; poison &quot; ; 
Sadat says &quot; assassination &quot; ; and Mubarak answers &quot; Al Jazeera . &quot; 
During the 15 years that it has broadcast from Qatar , Al Jazeera has served as far more than a traditional television station . 
With its fearless involvement in Arab politics , it has created a new venue for political freedom , which has culminated in its unreserved support for Arab revolutions . 
Al Jazeera has pushed the boundaries of information by providing live coverage of major developments in the Arab world and elsewhere . 
It is a platform for political and religious opposition groups in the Arab countries . 
It hosts Israeli spokespersons and embraces state-of-the-art broadcasting techniques . 
In short , it has become a global brand and a role model for other Arab media . 
Success breeds confidence , but it also attracts envy . 
Al Jazeera has no shortage of enemies , from the most radical Islamic fundamentalists to American and Israeli intelligence gatherers . 
Liberals who welcome it as a beacon of freedom and progress in the Arab world confront those who accuse it of Islamism and religious radicalization . 
Islamists who praise it as a platform for their own views must deal with the fact that it also offers a voice to Israelis . 
Al Jazeera journalists are household names ; they also suffer more harassment , imprisonment , and fatalities than their colleagues at other major news organizations . 
Al Jazeera is not a tool of the CIA , Israel , or Al Qaeda . 
Rather , it is the sophisticated mouthpiece of the state of Qatar and its ambitious Emir , Hamad Al Thani . 
Simply put , the Al Jazeera success story would not have been possible without Qatar &apos;s backing . 
For Al Thani , Al Jazeera is integral to the national &quot; branding &quot; of Qatar and its foreign-policy aspirations . 
The motivation for these aspirations is unclear , but a number of ideas are worth pondering . 
After deposing his father in a palace coup in 1995 , Al Thani was suddenly confronted with a hostile Saudi Arabia and Egypt , whose elites despised the ambitious young ruler and preferred his more timid father . 
Qatar was perceived as increasingly rebellious , routinely defecting from the collective and mundane line of Gulf countries &quot; politics - inviting further pressures from the &quot; big brothers . &quot; 
In response , under the young Emir &apos;s firm hand , Al Jazeera delivered a more assertive line of criticism against governments , such as those of Egypt and Saudi Arabia , that other Arab mainstream media would do their best to avoid alienating . 
Having received carte blanche from Qatar &apos;s political leadership to support the Arab revolutions , Al Jazeera became fully engaged in live coverage of events in Tunisia , and then in Egypt , by relying on social-media networks away from the eyes of local security officials . 
Its coverage was filled with Arab masses declaring their demands to the world . 
Banned from local media and mostly on the run , revolutionaries used Al Jazeera to reach - and mobilize - their own people . 
The channel canceled its regular programs , and was transformed into a round-the-clock workshop of live news and interviews , switching from one revolution to another . 
So , while the Arab Spring has been a genuine popular uprising against decades of corrupt and oppressive authoritarian regimes , its rapid spread , which caught almost everyone by surprise , was due in part to the influence of Al Jazeera , which became the voice of the voiceless throughout the Middle East . 
As for Qatar itself , Al Thani provided various forms of support to all of the Arab revolutions , except in Bahrain , where the Saudis and , more pointedly , the Americans , drew a very sharp red line . 
Al Thani &apos;s political audacity stems partly from Qatar &apos;s enormous gas resources , which have allowed him to develop vigorous policies in all areas , especially in foreign affairs . 
Protecting himself and Qatar by hosting the largest American military base outside the United States , his strategy has been to wrest control from regional third parties who might otherwise dominate the smaller Gulf states . 
At the same time , Qatar has created strong links with both Israel and many Islamist movements , including Hamas and Hezbollah . 
It has been an aggressive and risky foreign policy , but Al Thani clearly believes that he can fill a regional leadership vacuum . 
His support , via Al Jazeera , of the Arab Spring &apos;s revolutions - and of the new generation of leaders that they have spawned - has only strengthened Qatar &apos;s position . 
The falling regimes consistently maintained that Al Jazeera wasn &apos;t neutral .
