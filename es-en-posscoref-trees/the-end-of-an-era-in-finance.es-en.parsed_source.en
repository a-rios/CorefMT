The End of an Era in Finance 
CAMBRIDGE - In the world of economics and finance , revolutions occur rarely and are often detected only in hindsight . 
But what happened on February 19 can safely be called the end of an era in global finance . 
On that day , the International Monetary Fund published a policy note that reversed its long-held position on capital controls . 
Taxes and other restrictions on capital inflows , the IMF &apos;s economists wrote , can be helpful , and they constitute a &quot; legitimate part &quot; of policymakers &quot; toolkit . 
Rediscovering the common sense that had strangely eluded the Fund for two decades , the report noted : &quot; logic suggests that appropriately designed controls on capital inflows could usefully complement &quot; other policies . 
As late as November of last year , IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn had thrown cold water on Brazil &apos;s efforts to stem inflows of speculative &quot; hot money , &quot; and said that he would not recommend such controls &quot; as a standard prescription . &quot; 
So February &apos;s policy note is a stunning reversal - as close as an institution can come to recanting without saying , &quot; Sorry , we messed up . &quot; 
But it parallels a general shift in economists &quot; opinion . 
It is telling , for example , that Simon Johnson , the IMF &apos;s chief economist during 2007-2008 , has turned into one of the most ardent supporters of strict controls on domestic and international finance . 
The IMF &apos;s policy note makes clear that controls on cross-border financial flows can be not only desirable , but also effective . 
This is important , because the traditional argument of last resort against capital controls has been that they could not be made to stick . 
Financial markets would always outsmart the policymakers . 
Even if true , evading the controls requires incurring additional costs to move funds in and out of a country - which is precisely what the controls aim to achieve . 
Otherwise , why would investors and speculators cry bloody murder whenever capital controls are mentioned as a possibility ? 
If they really couldn &apos;t care less , then they shouldn &apos;t care at all . 
One justification for capital controls is to prevent inflows of hot money from boosting the value of the home currency excessively , thereby undermining competitiveness . 
Another is to reduce vulnerability to sudden changes in financial-market sentiment , which can wreak havoc with domestic growth and employment . 
To its credit , the IMF not only acknowledges this , but it also provides evidence that developing countries with capital controls were hit less badly by the fallout from the sub-prime mortgage meltdown . 
The IMF &apos;s change of heart is important , but it needs to be followed by further action . 
We currently don &apos;t know much about designing capital-control regimes . 
The taboo that has attached to capital controls has discouraged practical , policy-oriented work that would help governments to manage capital flows directly . 
There is some empirical research on the consequences of capital controls in countries such as Chile , Colombia , and Malaysia , but very little systematic research on the appropriate menu of options . 
The IMF can help to fill the gap . 
Emerging markets have resorted to a variety of instruments to limit private-sector borrowing abroad : taxes , unremunerated reserve requirements , quantitative restrictions , and verbal persuasion . 
In view of the sophisticated nature of financial markets , the devil is often in the details - and what works in one setting is unlikely to work well in others . 
For example , Taiwan &apos;s use of administrative measures that rely heavily on close monitoring of flows may be inappropriate in settings where bureaucratic capacity is more limited . 
Similarly , Chilean-style unremunerated reserve requirements may be easier to evade in countries with extensive trading in sophisticated derivatives . 
With the stigma on capital controls gone , the IMF should now get to work on developing guidelines on what kind of controls work best and under what circumstances . 
The IMF provides countries with technical assistance in a wide range of areas : monetary policy , bank regulation , and fiscal consolidation . 
It is time to add managing the capital account to this list . 
With this battle won , the next worthy goal is a global financial transaction tax . 
Set at a very low level - 0.05 % is a commonly mentioned rate - such a tax would raise hundreds of billions of dollars for global public goods while discouraging short-term speculative activities in financial markets . 
Support for a global financial-transaction tax is growing . 
A group of NGOs have rechristened it the &quot; Robin Hood tax , &quot; and have launched a global campaign to promote it , complete with a deliciously biting video clip featuring British actor Bill Nighy ( www.robinhoodtax.org ) . 
Significantly , the European Union has thrown its weight behind the tax and urged the IMF to pursue it . 
The only major holdout is the United States , where Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has made his distaste for the proposal clear . 
What made finance so lethal in the past was the combination of economists &quot; ideas with the political power of banks . 
The bad news is that big banks retain significant political power . 
The good news is that the intellectual climate has shifted decisively against them . 
Shorn of support from economists , the financial industry will have a much harder time preventing the fetish of free finance from being tossed into the dustbin of history .
