Ecb Is Now Europe &apos;s Anchor 
The European Central Bank is making its reputation at this time of turmoil and crisis . 
Barely a month after the rejection of the European Union Constitution in France and the Netherlands , the EU Summit in Brussels ended in a surprisingly acrimonious orgy of national egoisms and no deal . 
With all this trouble , the ECB is showing itself to be an &quot; anchor of stability &quot; by steadfastly sticking to its mandate of insuring price stability . 
Europe suffers from a profound crisis of confidence . 
Its economy , for example , cannot recover properly because consumers , lacking confidence in the ability of their political leaders to solve the economy &apos;s manifold economic problems ( budget deficits , pensions , etc . ) , are saving for a rainy day they feel is just around the corner - and businessmen are reluctant to invest , because they don &apos;t trust government to make the necessary economic reforms . 
The public &apos;s lack of confidence in the EU &apos;s political leadership is totally justified . 
Instead of actually doing something constructive about Europe &apos;s essential problem  - reforming expensive welfare states to ensure global competitiveness - Europe &apos;s political leaders are hiding behind straw man arguments about &quot; ultra liberal Anglo Saxon models , &quot; and pressuring the ECB to lower interest rates as if European economic weakness were Frankfurt &apos;s fault . 
Europe &apos;s finance ministers portray the ECB as closed to dialogue . 
When testifying before the EU Parliament &apos;s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , Luxembourg prime minister and Euro-group chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said there should be &quot; open and frank &quot; talks between the euro-group ministers and the ECB - and French finance minister Dominique de Villepin said the same thing . 
According to a knowledgeable ECB source , however , Europe &apos;s finance ministers regularly meet in secret with the ECB leadership for a mutual and frank exchange of views on monetary policy and other issues . 
The dialogue already exists though the public does not know it . 
Such disingenuousness does little to boost confidence in Europe &apos;s political leadership . 
The ECB has done all it can for growth by giving Europe a prolonged period of monetary stability at record low interest rates . 
Does anyone really believe consumers are holding back on spending - and businessmen postponing their investments - in anticipation of that next drop in interest rates ? 
To paraphrase Keynes , you can lead a horse to water but you can &apos;t make him drink . 
&quot; The last thing Europe needs now is an interest rate cut , &quot; says one influential member of the ECB Governing Council in a candid assessment of the current situation . Capitulating to outside political pressure is no one &apos;s definition of an &quot; anchor of stability . &quot; 
The euro would collapse , and the ECB finished as a creditable central bank . 
Moreover , ECB chief economist Otmar Issing predicts long- term interest rates would go up - not down - as inflationary expectations increased . 
So cutting interest rates would not only be stupid - it would be crazy . 
But the ECB is not going to cut rates even though , for public relations reasons of keeping the political wolves at bay , it deceptively hints it might . 
Don &apos;t be fooled by such feints . 
This is vital . 
History shows political turmoil often leads to inflation , which only fuels further turmoil . 
Europeans can bet their last euro the ECB will not let the fledgling common currency be ravaged by inflation because their political leaders , having failed to do their jobs , now fear they might lose them . 
Indeed , the courage currently demonstrated by the ECB in sticking to its guns should serve as a model for Europe &apos;s future politicians . 
Once they realize they can &apos;t bully the ECB into unwanted and self-destructive interest rate cuts , EU leaders actually might summon up the will to lead - which is , after all , what they have been elected to do .
