Reviving the West 
LONDON - In 2008 , at a time of financial peril , the world united to restructure the global banking system . 
In 2009 , as trade collapsed and unemployment rose dramatically , the world came together for the first time in the G-20 to prevent a great recession from spiraling into a great depression . 
Now , facing a low-growth austerity decade with no national exits from long-term unemployment and diminished living standards , the world needs to come together in the first half of 2011 to agree on a financial and economic strategy for prosperity far bolder than the Marshall Plan of the 1940 &quot; s . 
Time is running out on the West , because both Europe and America have yet to digest the fact that all the individual crises of the last few years - from the sub-prime crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers to Greek austerity and Ireland &apos;s near-bankruptcy - are symptoms of a deeper problem : a world undergoing a far-reaching , irreversible , and , indeed , unprecedented restructuring of economic power . 
Of course , we all know of Asia &apos;s rise , and that China exports more than America and will soon manufacture and invest more as well . 
But we have not fully come to terms with the sweep of history . 
Western economic dominance - 10 % of the world &apos;s population producing a majority of the world &apos;s exports and investment - is finished , never to return . 
After two centuries in which Europe and America monopolized global economic activity , the West is now being out-produced , out-manufactured , out-traded , and out-invested by the rest of the world . 
Otto von Bismarck once described the patterns of world history . 
Transformations do not happen with &quot; the even speed of a railway train , &quot; he said . 
Once in motion they occur &quot; with irresistible force . &quot; If the West fails to understand that the real issue today is responding to the rise of Asian economic power by renewing its own , then it faces the grim prospect of steady decline , punctuated by brief moments of recovery - until the next financial crisis . 
Throughout it all , millions will be without jobs . 
So why , despite this new reality , am I convinced that the twenty-first century can be one in which the United States , by reinventing the American dream for a new generation , remains a magnet for the greatest companies , and in which Europe can be home to a high-employment economy ? 
Because , fortunately for all of us , soon one billion and more new Asian producers will - first in their tens of millions , then in their hundreds of millions - become new middle-class consumers , too . 
The growth of an Asian consumer revolution offers America a road to new greatness . Today Chinese consumer spending is just 3 % of world economic activity , in contrast to Europe and America &apos;s 36 % share . 
Those two figures illustrate why the world economy is currently so unbalanced . 
By 2020 or so , Asia and the emerging-market countries will bring double America &apos;s consumer power to the world economy . 
Already , companies like GE , Intel , Proctor 
Gamble , and Dow Jones have announced that the majority of their growth will come from Asia . 
Already , many Korean , Indian , and Asian multinationals have majority foreign ( including US ) shareholdings . 
This new driver of world economic growth opens up an opportunity for America to exploit its great innovative and entrepreneurial energy to create new , high-skilled jobs for US workers . 
Asian consumer growth - and a rebalancing of the global economy - can be the exit strategy from our economic crisis . 
But the West will benefit only if it takes the right long-term decisions on the biggest economic questions - what to do about deficits , financial institutions , trade wars , and global cooperation ? 
First , deficit reduction must occur in a way that expands investment in science , technology , innovation , and education . 
Both public and private investment will be needed in order to deliver the best science and education in the world . 
Second , new markets cannot be tapped if the West succumbs to protectionism . 
Banning cross-border takeovers , restricting trade , and living with currency wars will hurt the US more than any other country . 
In the last century , America &apos;s own domestic market was so big and dominant that it need not worry much about trade rules . 
But , with Asia poised to be the biggest consumer market in history , US exporters - the greatest potential beneficiaries - will need open trade more than ever . 
America must become the champion of a new global trade deal . 
A commitment to public investment and open trade are , however , necessary but insufficient conditions for sustained prosperity . 
All the global opportunities of the new decade could fade if countries withdraw into their own national shells . 
In another age , Winston Churchill warned a world facing the gravest of challenges not to be resolved to be irresolute , adamant for drift , solid for fluidity , and all powerful for impotence . 
I believe that the world today does have leaders of Churchill &apos;s stature . 
If they work together , drift need not happen . 
America must now lead and ask the world to agree on a modern Marshall Plan that coordinates trade and macroeconomic policies to boost global growth . 
America should work with the new chair of the G-20 , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , to revive private lending by creating global certainty about the standards and rules expected of banks . 
Agreement is also needed that each country &apos;s multi-year deficit-reduction plan will be accompanied by acceleration of consumer spending in the East and of targeted investment in education and innovation in the West . 
Such a plan must encourage China and Asia to do what is in their and the world &apos;s interest : reducing poverty and expanding the middle class . 
And 
Through joint action , the G-20 economies can see not just a marginal change , but growth above 5 % by 2014 . 
Instead of a world deadlocked over currencies and trade and retreating into the illusory shelter of protectionism , we could see $ 3 trillion of growth converted into 25 million to 30 million new jobs , and 40 million or more people freed from poverty .
