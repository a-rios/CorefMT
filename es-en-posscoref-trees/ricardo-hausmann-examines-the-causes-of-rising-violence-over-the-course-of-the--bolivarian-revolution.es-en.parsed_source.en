Venezuela &apos;s Bad Angels 
CARACAS - Fish do not know they are in water . 
They would need to get out of water to understand how different things could be . 
Similarly , one way for people to see the uniqueness of what they consider normal is to contrast it with the past - or with an outlier , an example that bucks the current trend . 
A case in point is the dramatically low levels of violence that characterize the present , a fact uncovered by Steven Pinker in his 2011 book The Better Angels of Our Nature . 
The facts are imposing and incontrovertible . 
As Pinker convincingly shows , violence of all kinds has declined over the millennia , in recent centuries , and during the past decades . 
Humans , according to Pinker , have both good and bad angels ( or passions ) , and the good ones have become more dominant . 
Why ? 
For starters , Leviathan - that is , the state &apos;s monopoly on the legitimate use of force - has reduced conflict and increased personal security . 
Second , the state &apos;s administration of justice adopted and encouraged non-violent ways of resolving grievances , thus allowing cooperation and the expansion of commerce . 
This trend accelerated with the spread of Enlightenment humanist ideals based on fundamental human equality and the application of rationality to human affairs . 
In this respect , Venezuela is the proverbial fish out of water . 
During the 15 years of the &quot; Bolivarian Revolution &quot; initiated by the late Hugo Chávez , the country &apos;s homicide rate has quadrupled , from a high base of 19 per 100,000 in 1998 to 79 in 2013 , roughly 17 times the average in the United States , 26 times that in Chile , and more than 30 times the combined average of OECD countries . 
In a sample of 145 countries assembled by the World Bank , Venezuela &apos;s homicide numbers since 1995 have been exceeded only by Honduras and El Salvador , countries with less than one-third of Venezuela &apos;s per capita income . 
And Venezuela &apos;s murder boom came despite an 8-fold increase in oil prices in the intervening period , which massively increased the country &apos;s exports and fiscal revenues . 
Adopting Pinker &apos;s perspective , one key element underpinning the rise in violence in Venezuela is the voluntary weakening of Leviathan . 
While there are no armed opposition groups , the government has sponsored the creation of armed paramilitary groups , known locally as colectivos , charged with defending the &quot; revolution . &quot; 
Thus , they bear a striking similarity to the Nazi brown shirts , the Fascist black shirts , and the various &quot; people &apos;s militias &quot; that were established under communist regimes . 
Just recently , the colectivos made international headlines when , on February 18 , acting on the orders of a state governor , they attacked a peaceful demonstration , killing Genesis Carmona , a beauty queen . 
They openly control parts of Caracas and other cities . 
On February 24 , President Nicolás Maduro invited them to ride their motorcycles to the presidential palace . 
One reason why a ruling party or political movement might create armed support groups is to deter the regular armed forces from attempting a coup . 
In Venezuela , for example , the situation would become very messy , because the colectivos would wreak havoc . 
Such groups may also reflect an effort to impose social order through fear . 
But there is something else underlying their establishment : an anti-Enlightenment ideology of violence . 
While chavismo arrived in power via the ballot box , its leaders wished it had done so with bullets , like their hero Che Guevara . 
That is why the colectivos erected a bust of Tirofijo , the deceased leader of Colombia &apos;s FARC guerrilla group , and why they photograph their children with assault rifles , covered faces , and military garb . 
The ideology of violence is underpinned by the Marxian idea that the road to progress is class struggle . 
The way forward involves inculcating hatred among &quot; the people &quot; of their class enemies . 
In this framework , there is no collective sense of a communal &quot; we &quot; that has agreed to live together under rules that apply equally to all . 
Institutions designed for liberal democracies - such as an independent judiciary , a comptroller-general , and a free press - become assets to be seized and used in the class struggle . 
As a consequence , the law is used only against political opponents , the budgetary division between party and state disappears , and those delivering bad news are treated harshly , as many local media have long known , and as global news outlets like CNN have recently discovered . 
For many years , Venezuela &apos;s dismal dynamics generated little open revolt . 
But , since February 12 , things have changed radically . 
Previously , skyrocketing insecurity , massive shortages , high inflation , and police brutality were simply facts of life with which Venezuelans had to cope on their own . 
Now , however , they have fueled a collective sense of outrage that demands civil disobedience as the only possible moral stance . 
The fish know they are out of water . 
Venezuela will not be able to join the global trend of declining violence unless its government reestablishes Leviathan , which implies disarming the colectivos . 
The country will be unable to avoid tyranny unless it is willing to respect the minimal democratic guarantees provided by the constitution , such as a supreme court , an attorney general , a comptroller , and an electoral council appointed with two-thirds of the National Assembly &apos;s support . 
All of these institutions require political forces to negotiate with , rather than persecute , their opponents . 
Most important , Venezuela will also have to abandon the ideology of class warfare . 
Pinker aptly quotes Voltaire : &quot; Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities . &quot;
