How Military Should Japan Be ? 
Is it time for Japan to prime its weapons and sail out into the world in defense of peace ? 
The very idea still incites howls of protest in Asia - not least in Japan , where popular attachment to the country &apos;s postwar &quot; peace &quot; constitution remains powerful . 
Yet Japan &apos;s modestly named Self-Defense Forces are involved in many regional hot spots ( no combat duty , of course ) and seek to play a more active part in UN peacekeeping . 
If a shooting war ever breaks out in Asia , Japan is nowadays prepared to do a lot more than fill the petrol tanks . 
It is past time for these modest changes , because the Asia / Pacific region &apos;s many fault lines affect the interests of the world &apos;s great and emerging powers in fundamental ways . 
Northeast Asia contains the last remnants of the Cold War : the divided Korean Peninsula and hostile glares across the Taiwan Straits . 
Southeast Asia forms its own unique geo-political environment , with a wide variety of ethnic groups , cultures , and religions in tension - as the current Islamic unrest in Thailand attests . 
Beyond these conventional strategic concerns , the emergence of global terrorism and the Iraq War re-enforce Japan &apos;s sense that the strategic environment has changed profoundly . 
The roles and obligations of the Self-Defense Forces must gradually shift and diversify , and their zone of action broadened . 
Neat binary concepts like &quot; peacetime &quot; and &quot; wartime &quot; are no longer viable . 
The world must get used to a twilight security environment of sudden and peripheral emergencies . 
Japan &apos;s laws are primed for this change , because the obligations of the Self-Defense Forces are relatively clear in these circumstances . 
The &quot; Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law &quot; allows the Self-Defense Forces to participate in the fight against international terrorism , although the form of participation is limited to logistical support . 
Nor are the Self-Defense Forces &apos; operations and obligations any longer restricted to Japanese territory and the adjacent seas . 
Ever since Japan dispatched minesweepers to the Persian Gulf after the Gulf War in 1991 , the Self-Defense Forces have been expanding their activities beyond Japan and its immediate vicinity to include international peacekeeping missions , emergency relief operations , multilateral military exercises , and naval refueling support in the Indian Ocean . 
Self-Defense Force units have been dispatched to southern Iraq to provide humanitarian aid and support reconstruction efforts . 
Of course , the obligation of the Self-Defense Forces not to engage in offensive combat operations remains unchanged . 
With its expanded roles , however , the Self-Defense Forces are well prepared to engage in other military operations , such as shadowing and chasing spy ships , anti-terror activities , and missions to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles . 
Japan &apos;s warships can help with sanctions monitoring and minesweeping . 
Its ships and aircraft can rescue stranded nationals . 
But these incremental changes in Japan &apos;s military capacity and policies , though necessary and effective , can be sustained only with a clear national consensus on the country &apos;s defense interests . 
The international community &apos;s demand that Japan participate directly in resolving global tensions has helped , by changing the terms of domestic debate . 
The old deadlock on security issues is relaxing , and the Japanese public , recognizing the changed international environment , mostly embraces the Self-Defense Forces &apos; deployment in pursuit of international and regional responsibilities . 
Every Japanese citizen may have his or her own opinion , but a clear majority appear to agree that Japan must become a prominent nation in promoting international and regional security , as well as economic growth . 
To achieve these ends , Japan must be endowed with responsibilities equivalent to the country &apos;s national power , while securing the safety , comfort , and prosperity of Japan and preserving the people &apos;s identity as Japanese with pride and honor . 
Achieving these goals requires fulfilling several conditions . 
Japan &apos;s political leadership needs to be founded on a competitive but stable political structure . 
Only a truly popular political mandate can assure that the Japanese people are fully aware of their international responsibilities as an influential nation in the international community . 
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi seems to grasp much of this , and so is undertaking discussions on security and defense that aim to help revise the &quot; National Defense Program Outline . &quot; 
Those with bitter memories of Japanese behavior half a century ago should be reassured ; this debate is about how to defend peace , not about how to promote or wage war . 
Many of Japan &apos;s neighbors were understandably reassured by the Cold War arrangement whereby America promised to defend Japan , relieving the country of the need for a powerful military . 
The one-sided nature of this alliance rankled little when Japan was just one among many protected by America &apos;s global shield . 
As Japan prospered under America &apos;s protection , it prided itself on being a &quot; civilian &quot; power , using its trade and aid , rather than tanks and guns , to encourage stability . 
But America , in its global war on terror , has justifiably lost interest in bearing Asia &apos;s many military burdens alone . 
Hence , Japan must be seen to be doing more to support its inseparable ally , as well as international peacekeeping efforts in general . 
A rich and powerful Japan in a region as dangerous as East Asia cannot go on playing military bit parts forever . 
The question is whether Japan &apos;s Self-Defense Forces work alongside America and the world in defense of world peace now , or eventually do so alone in defense of Japan .
