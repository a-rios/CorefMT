Germany &apos;s Gold Delusion 
WASHINGTON , DC - Germany &apos;s gold is on the move . 
For the first time since official gold transactions became more transparent , the Bundesbank has given notice that a significant portion of its holdings will be transferred home from France and the United States . 
Ostensibly , this is just a matter of monetary housekeeping . 
But why now ? 
One possibility is that German policymakers believe that we are approaching an every-country-for-itself scenario - and only gold guarded by one &apos;s own police is worth anything . 
But this is more than far-fetched . 
The world in which financial trust breaks down completely between Germany and France or Germany and the US is one in which we have much bigger problems than where a country &apos;s gold is located . 
International trade would collapse , and major global companies would struggle to sell their products . 
Having more gold at home , rather than in the vaults of the New York Fed , would be neither here nor there in such a situation . 
Does Germany think that its gold will be subject to sanctions or some form of confiscation - as sometimes happens to rogue nations ? 
Again , this is hardly plausible . 
Countries like Iran and Venezuela work long and hard to become international pariahs . 
Germany , by contrast , is a mainstay of the democratic world . 
That is not going to change . 
Perhaps German central bankers sense a longer-term shift in international preferences away from the dollar and want to be ready in some fashion . 
This is plausible in terms of a future decline in the dollar &apos;s importance as a reserve asset and safe haven . 
Reserve holdings of dollar assets ( primarily by central banks ) were worth around 2 % of US GDP in 1948 and about the same in 1968 . 
Today , such holdings are at least 15 % of US GDP - with some estimates as high as 30 % . 
Much of this rise stems from growing prosperity and current-account surpluses in middle-income countries . 
When you sell more to the world than you buy , you accumulate claims on the rest of the world - and you need to decide the form in which you want to hold those claims . 
At present , the world holds a lot of US dollar assets , and greater diversification of portfolios in coming years would not be shocking . 
There is certainly much discussion of the renminbi &apos;s rising international role - an issue on which Arvind Subramanian , my colleague at the Peterson Institute for International Economics , continues to do the most interesting work . 
But moving Germany &apos;s gold is hardly helpful in this regard . 
What would help is to turn the euro around - in the sense of convincing investors that the common currency has a bright future , because it is underpinned by a stronger monetary , fiscal , financial , and political union . 
When seen in this light , the physical location of gold is purely a distraction . 
It is as if German political elites think that they are back in the era of the gold standard . 
But , even back then , what mattered was the amount of gold you owned - not where it was actually stored . 
The broader and more worrying trend is the politicization of central banking . 
Leading German political figures are becoming increasingly suspicious of the European Central Bank , while also worrying aloud about the US Federal Reserve &apos;s monetary policy . 
Their motivating fear is the prospect of inflation . 
But the real fear is not inflation itself - that is , that prices might rise at a surprisingly fast clip this year or next . 
Rather , the fear is that central banks will not see inflation coming until it is too late , and that this will cause a major upward shift in inflation expectations . 
Again , moving gold does nothing to keep inflation under control or change the behavior of central banks . 
The link between currencies and gold was irrevocably broken in 1971 , when US President Richard Nixon decided to suspend the convertibility of dollars into gold for central banks . 
We have lived in a purely fiat money system ever since - meaning that our money &apos;s value is not backed by gold or any other physical item . 
Such monetary systems can succeed only as long as the central bank can credibly commit to keeping inflation under control . 
German politicians would thus seem to be suffering from some serious delusions about the importance of gold and the effects of shifting its location . 
But they are right to worry about the ECB &apos;s policies : Providing unconditional credit to eurozone governments is unlikely to make these governments more careful . 
There is a real danger that so-called &quot; fiscal dominance &quot; will undermine monetary policy and make it much harder to control inflation . 
The German fascination with gold is a red herring . 
Its fear of wayward monetary policy is not .
