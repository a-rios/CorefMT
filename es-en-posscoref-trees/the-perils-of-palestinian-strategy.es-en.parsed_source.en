The Perils of Palestinian Strategy 
TEL AVIV - It should be clear to all by now that talks between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu cannot produce a peace agreement . 
Yet it would be wrong to dwell excessively on current leaders &quot; weaknesses , for to do so presupposes that with different leaders at the helm , an Israeli-Palestinian agreement could be reached through bilateral negotiations . 
Alas , as a recent leak of Palestinian official papers demonstrates , this is not the case . 
This typifies the dissonant historical rhythms of the Middle East . 
In the past , Israel &apos;s offers were rejected by the Palestinians ; now it seems that Israel spurned especially flexible Palestinian positions.Personalities are , of course , important in history , but the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has for decades been a hostage to the impersonal forces of history . 
Indeed , failure to reach a settlement in the past was not the result of bad faith , or inadequate negotiating skills . 
Rather , failure stemmed from the inherent incapacity of both parties to reconcile themselves to each other &apos;s fundamental requirements for a settlement . 
Left to our own devices , we have proven ourselves tragically incapable of breaking the genetic code of our dispute . 
Abbas is thus right to opt for a new peace paradigm , but his plan for a unilateral declaration of Palestinian independence might be the wrong choice . 
He expects that a unilateral yet internationally recognized declaration of a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders would put unbearable pressure on an Israel haunted by the specter of worldwide de-legitimization . 
The devastating effects of the new Palestinian strategy on Israel &apos;s international standing cannot be denied . 
The current wave of international recognition of Palestinian statehood is indeed a major blow to Israel &apos;s foreign relations . 
Particularly painful is that key Latin American countries , where Israel once enjoyed an almost mythological status , have joined that wave . 
Abbas assumes that from the moment his state is recognized by the United Nations Security Council , Israel will become the illegal occupier of a sovereign state ( and a full member of the UN ) . 
At that point , Israel would thus be subject to international sanctions that would destroy its economy and further undermine its image , condemning the country to the status of an international pariah . 
But , notwithstanding the damage that the Palestinian strategy is inflicting on Israel &apos;s increasingly fragile international standing , Abbas might be embarking on what could turn out to be a self-defeating diplomatic exercise . 
Already feeling the heat of a major diplomatic debacle , Israel might soon pre-empt the Palestinian diplomatic offensive with a &quot; peace plan &quot; of its own . 
Inevitably inadequate - one idea being toyed with is recognition of a Palestinian state in provisional borders that might encompass around 50 % of the West Bank - it will nonetheless occupy the attention of the international community , and perhaps even derail the new Palestinian strategy . 
Moreover , should Abbas fail to muster the support of the United States and Europe , Netanyahu might feel free to cancel existing agreements and engage in unilateral steps of his own . 
Nor would US and European support necessarily produce the results that Abbas expects . 
If pushed to the wall , Israel might try to extricate itself from an internationally untenable position by unilaterally disengaging from the West Bank up to its &quot; security fence . &quot; 
A hostile Palestinian state would then automatically emerge on the other side of what is in fact a massive wall - a state that might not necessarily be ruled by the PLO . 
A violent Israeli disengagement , and thus the end of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation on security matters , might unleash such instability that Hamas emerges as a serious contender for power in the West Bank . 
This , in turn , might draw Jordan into the affairs of the West Bank , just as Egypt is being drawn against its will into the affairs of Gaza . 
Another risk implied by a unilateral Palestinian move to statehood is that it might reduce the conflict with Israel to a banal border dispute between sovereign states . 
Any government that recognizes the Palestinian state would inevitably view that act as the end of the peace process , and neither Europe nor the US would include in the package any acknowledgement of the Palestinian right of return to areas lost to Israel in 1948 . 
Indeed , by unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state along the 1967 ceasefire line , Abbas would be putting into practice Israel &apos;s vision of &quot; two states for two peoples . &quot; 
Indeed , some on the Israeli side argue that , instead of fighting a Palestinian declaration of statehood , Israel should seize the opportunity to turn the conflict into a manageable state-to-state territorial dispute . 
It could then negotiate with the US the wording of the UN resolution in a way that would end up creating a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders , with mutually agreed territorial adjustments . 
Such a resolution would neutralize thorny &quot; narrative &quot; issues , such as the right of return , which have shattered every attempt to reach a settlement . 
Either way , we stand at the end of the peace process as we have known it to date . 
This Gordian knot cannot be untied ; it needs to be cut by robust third-party mediation . 
But a US peace plan aimed at bridging the gaps between the parties stands a chance only if it is built around a solid international alliance for an Israeli-Palestinian peace . 
Even then , such a plan would require especially laborious and complex diplomatic engineering . 
Yet , no matter how enamored of the &quot; international community &quot; they may be , the Palestinians might not be happy with a plan that comes from a US-led international alliance . 
A plan that almost certainly would have to satisfy Israel &apos;s security concerns and lean toward acknowledging its Jewishness - in a way that might entirely neutralize the Palestinian ethos of return - would be especially unpalatable to them .
