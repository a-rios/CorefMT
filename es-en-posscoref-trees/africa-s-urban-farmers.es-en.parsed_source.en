Africa &apos;s Urban Farmers 
NAIROBI - When I met Eunice Wangari at a Nairobi coffee shop recently , I was surprised to hear her on her mobile phone , insistently asking her mother about the progress of a corn field in her home village , hours away from the big city . 
A nurse , Wangari counts on income from farming to raise money to buy more land - for more farming . 
Even though Wangari lives in Kenya &apos;s capital , she is able to reap hundreds of dollars a year in profit from cash crops grown with the help of relatives . 
Her initial stake - drawn from her nursing wages of about $ 350 a month - has long since been recovered . 
Wangari is one of thousands of urban workers in Kenya - and one of hundreds of thousands , even millions , across Africa - who are increasing their incomes through absentee agriculture . 
With prices for basic foodstuffs at their highest levels in decades , many urbanites feel well rewarded by farming . 
Absentee agriculture also bolsters national pride - and pride in traditional diets - by specializing in vegetables specific to the region . 
Across Africa , political leaders , long dismissive of rural concerns , have awakened to the importance of agriculture and the role that educated people , even those living in major cities , can play in farming . 
In Nigeria , former President Olusegun Obasanjo has a huge diversified farm and has pushed for policies to help absentee farmers prosper . 
In Uganda , Vice President Gilbert Bukenya routinely travels the country , promoting higher-value farming , such as dairy production . 
Perhaps the most visible political support for absentee agriculture is in Liberia , a small West African country where civil war destroyed agriculture , rendering the population dependent on food imports , even today . 
President Johnson-Sirleaf , recognizing that educated people could contribute much to an agriculture revival , launched her &quot; Back to the Soil &quot; campaign in June 2008 in large part to encourage urban dwellers to farm . 
To be sure , absentee farming by elites and educated urban workers can &apos;t solve all of Africa &apos;s urgent food needs . 
Moreover , absentee farmers face unexpected problems . 
Because they don &apos;t visit their fields often , they rely heavily on relatives and friends . When I decided to farm wheat for the first time this spring on leased land in my childhood village , my mother agreed to supervise plowing , planting , and harvesting . 
Without her help , I might not have farmed at all . 
Even with mother &apos;s help , I have worries . 
Although I grew up around wheat fields , my knowledge of farming is thin . 
Fertilizer and spraying were both more expensive than I thought . 
While my wheat stalks are sprouting on schedule , I now fear that at harvest time - in November - prices will fall and I won &apos;t recoup my costs . 
One key tool is the mobile phone . 
My hopes for success are buoyed by my ability to call my mother inexpensively and discuss the farm . 
We even decided over the phone what kind of pesticide to use and which tractor company to hire . 
Because they know both the tastes of fellow city dwellers and rural conditions , many urban farmers are succeeding . 
In fact , some city dwellers don &apos;t even bother with acquiring land or gaining distant help . 
Certain crops can be grown in their own homes . 
James Memusi , an accountant , grows mushrooms in a spare bedroom , selling them to nearby hotels and supermarkets . 
Nevertheless , most people living in Africa &apos;s cities have access to land in the countryside , which is why Liberia &apos;s government rightly highlights the potential for farm expansion . 
In a new advertising campaign rolled out this summer , the authorities declared , &quot; The soil is a bank ; invest in it . &quot; 
In Liberia , the main push is to reduce imports of staples such as rice and tomatoes . 
In more prosperous countries , African elites are motivated by a complex interplay of national pride , dietary concerns , and the pursuit of profit . 
In Zambia , for example , Sylva Banda ignited a craze for authentic traditional meals two decades ago with a chain of popular restaurants . 
Now , ordinary Lusakans want to cook similar meals in their own homes , driving demand for farmers who produce such delicacies as dried pumpkin , &quot; black jack &quot; leaves , and fresh Okra . 
Similarly , in Nairobi , Miringo Kinyanjui , another woman entrepreneur , is supplying unrefined - and more nutritious - maize and wheat flour . 
In another move to distinguish her ingredients from Western versions , Kinyanjui also sells through grocery stores flour flavored with Amarathan , a green vegetable that grows around Kenya . 
The revival of traditional foods has attracted the attention of large multinational corporations . 
Last year , Unilever &apos;s Kenyan branch ran a &quot; taste our culture &quot; campaign in support of its line of traditional East African herbs and spices . 
Such campaigns go hand-in-hand with expanded farming , because sellers of these foods prefer nearby growers - even if these growers increasingly live in the city .
