Russia is Burning 
MOSCOW - For over a month , Moscow has been boiling in 40-degree ( 100 degrees Fahrenheit ) heat and heavy , sticky , eye-burning smog . 
Carbon monoxide levels have reached crisis levels , at six times the maximum allowable concentration . 
Other toxic substances in Moscow &apos;s air are at nine times the normal level . 
In early August , a journalist called the office of Moscow &apos;s mayor , seeking comments on the situation . 
&quot; The office is closed , &quot; a woman at the press office answered , adding that smog had gotten inside the mayoral building , which is located less than two miles from the Kremlin , so everyone was ordered to go home . 
This was a weekday , shortly after lunch . 
&quot; Is it at all possible to get a comment from Mayor Yuri Luzhkov ? &quot; the reporter asked . 
&quot; He is not in Moscow , &quot; the woman replied . 
Indeed , there are reports that the mayor &apos;s press secretary has been telling journalists that there is no reason for the mayor to return to Moscow . 
&quot; Why should he ? &quot; said the secretary . 
&quot; Is there a crisis in Moscow ? 
No , there is no crisis . &quot; 
At the same time , a doctor from a local hospital was writing on his blog : &quot; It is a disaster . 
There is no air conditioning in the hospital , no ventilators working , smog is penetrating everywhere , including the emergency room &apos;s operating theatre . 
Each day , 16-17 people die . 
The morgue is full , and there are not enough refrigerators for the dead - they just put bodies along the walls . &quot; 
Indeed , according to the Moscow City Health Department , the death rate has doubled over the past few weeks . 
And yet Moscow &apos;s mayor chose to remain on vacation outside the country . 
Thankfully , comments coming from Luzhkov &apos;s press office caused such a public outrage that the mayor cut short his holiday to return to the city . 
One wonders what would have happened if Luzhkov needed to face re-election ( his term expires in October 2011 ) . 
Would he have allowed himself such a vacation while his city was being ravaged by heat and toxic smog ? 
Of course not . 
But neither Luzhkov , nor whoever may replace him , must worry about voter approval , as the Kremlin appoints Moscow &apos;s mayor , rather than allowing for free and fair elections - a practice instituted a few years back by then-President Vladimir Putin for all such important positions across Russia . 
Another example of this is the Nizhniy Novgorod region , just 400 kilometers ( 250 miles ) east of Moscow , which has been hit hard by the heat wave and fire . 
At least 36 people , including 7 children , have lost their lives in this region ( in total 52 people have died in the European part of Russia due to fire ) , and more than 1,000 people have lost their homes and livelihoods . 
Rare candid footage of Prime Minister Putin , displayed on government channels , depicted him visiting one of the towns in the region . 
People who had lost their homes , clothing , and everything else were complaining to Putin that the regional and local government did not warn them that the fire was coming . 
There were practically no fire trucks . 
In many towns and villages , there was no electricity , so water pumps were not operable . 
&quot; No one even tried to save us , &quot; they wailed to Putin , who was accompanied by the regional governor , Valery Shantsev . 
A week later , an inauguration ceremony officially began Shantsev &apos;s second term in office . 
Like all other Russian governors , he was not elected by those who live in his region ( before becoming governor , he was Luzhkov &apos;s deputy ) . 
He was appointed by the president , and thus bears no accountability whatsoever to those he is supposed to serve . 
The fires in the European part of Russia have destroyed 190,000 hectares of forest . 
Forestry specialists blame a carelessly enacted 2007 law that cut 90 % of forest guards . 
The law was proposed by the government and quickly passed by the Duma , where Putin &apos;s party controls two-thirds of the votes . 
Shortly before the vote , the speaker of the Duma proclaimed that parliament is not a place for deliberation . 
Hence , the legislation was passed without any second thought or discussion - and Russians are now facing the consequences . 
Russia &apos;s burning summer of 2010 underscores something that political scientists everywhere acknowledge . 
Authoritarian regimes , owing to their lack of accountability , are dreadful at coping with anomalous situations . 
By controlling the mass media - television first and foremost - the leaders in such counties lack the ability to envisage and calculate possible risks . 
Unfortunately , ordinary Russians have yet to connect the dots : the tragic situation in which they find themselves stems directly from how they voted in the past . 
The political apathy that characterizes today &apos;s Russia presents a serious challenge to the country &apos;s survival . 
But it seems that this apathy is beginning to lift . 
The burning summer of 2010 may help Russians to understand that their very existence depends on whether the authorities can provide assistance in times of emergency . 
A regime that cannot respond to its citizens &quot; basic needs has no legitimacy at all .
