The &quot; Right &quot; Growth for Africa 
Africa has the highest level of poverty in the world and is one of the two regions where poverty has not declined in the past twenty years . 
As the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa &apos;s forthcoming Economic Report on Africa 2005 shows , the proportion of the poor - those living on less that one dollar a day - halved between 1980 and 2003 at the global level , from 40 % to 20 % . 
But in Africa , the share of the poor increased slightly , from 45 % to 46 % . 
Africa &apos;s poverty rate in 2003 exceeds that of the next poorest region , South Asia , by 17 percentage points . 
Recognizing the link between economic growth and poverty reduction , those who crafted the UN &apos;s Millennium Development Goals ( MDG &apos;s ) estimated that halving poverty by 2015 in Africa requires countries to achieve an average minimum growth rate of 7 % annually . 
Whether or not African countries will reach this goal is an open question . 
Since the mid-1990 &quot; s , African economies have been recording growth rates that are higher than world averages . 
According to the World Bank , the average growth rate for the period 1996-2002 in Africa was about 3.6 % , compared to the world average of 2.7 % . 
Growth in Africa in 2004 averaged 5.1 % , the fastest in eight years . 
Growth rates this year and in 2006 are projected at 4.7 % and 5.2 % , respectively . 
These average rates mask stark differences between countries . 
In 2004 , for example , Chad &apos;s 39.4 % annual growth rate contrasted sharply with Zimbabwe &apos;s -6.8 % economic contraction . 
Nevertheless , there is no doubt that African economies , taken together , have recovered from the dark years of the 1980 &quot; s . 
So the big question is why growth hasn &apos;t translated into poverty reduction . 
One reason is that Africa &apos;s recent growth rates , while high by international standards , remain too low to have a substantial impact on poverty . 
Initial conditions are so low that only high and sustained growth levels may have a noticeable impact on poverty reduction . 
In no year has Africa , as a continent , achieved the 7 % average growth rate required by the MDG &apos;s . 
Consider Ethiopia . 
With its per capita GDP of about $ 100 , a growth rate of 7 % means that a typical Ethiopian will increase his income by $ 7 a year ( if this additional income is evenly distributed ) . 
But if this rate of growth were sustained over a period of just ten years , per capita income would double , which underscores the need for sustained high growth rates . 
Very few countries in Africa have posted growth rates consistent with the MDG &apos;s threshold . 
In 2004 , only six countries - Chad , Equatorial Guinea , Liberia , Ethiopia , Angola and Mozambique - had annual growth rates higher than 7 % . 
And only four countries sustained a growth rate of 7 % or more over the past five years . 
Moreover , most of the observed growth was generated by capital rather than labor-intensive sectors . 
If the fruit of economic growth reaches the poor through employment creation , growth in capital-intensive sectors has a limited effect on poverty reduction . 
Indeed , recent growth in Africa appears to have been fueled by increases in oil exports and high oil prices . 
Eight of the top 10 performers in 2004 are either oil-exporting countries or post-conflict economies , with the latter &apos;s high annual growth rates explained mostly by the proverbial &quot; dead cat bounce &quot; - the low base period over which growth is measured . 
Economic growth reduces poverty only if it benefits the poor , and the effect of growth on poverty reduction is a function of the pattern of income distribution within a country . 
Africa as a continent has the world &apos;s second highest measure of income concentration . 
This suggests that the new wealth created over the last ten years has mostly benefited the rich . 
To help reduce its poverty , Africa must strive to increase even further its growth rates and sustain them over a long period . 
Moreover , there must be greater balance between capital-intensive and labor-intensive activities . 
But encouraging labor-intensive industries , which create jobs for the poor , must not be at the expense of capital-intensive industries . 
Finally , Africa &apos;s income distribution must become more equitable . 
This is difficult , given that a skewed income distribution is usually a legacy of a country &apos;s history . 
But it is not impossible , particularly for those African countries that succeed in modernizing their political institutions .
