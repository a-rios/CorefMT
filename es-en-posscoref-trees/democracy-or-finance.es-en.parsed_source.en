Democracy or Finance ? 
LONDON - &quot; Shorting &quot; is a tactic well known among the financial cognoscenti . 
It means betting against an asset with borrowed money in the expectation of making a profit when its value goes down . 
A speculator can &quot; short &quot; a government by borrowing its debt at its current price , in the hope of selling it later at a lower price and pocketing the difference . 
For example : on January 1 , 2010 , I think to myself that the game will soon be up for the Greeks . 
I borrow , at face value , € 10 million of the Greek government &apos;s 2016 bond , which is then trading at € 0.91 , from Goldman Sachs for six months . 
For this , I have to pay Goldman Sachs the yield that it would receive from the bond - around 5 % annually at that price , so about 2.5 % , or € 250,000 - during the six-month term . 
I immediately sell that bond in the market , for € 0.91 , so I get € 9.1 million ( € 0.91 x € 10 million at face value ) . 
Fortunately , my bearish view comes to fruition in May , when the full extent of the country &apos;s fiscal problems becomes clear . 
By June 30 , when I am due to return the € 10 million in face-value Greek 2016 bonds to Goldman Sachs , the bond is trading at only around € 0.72 . 
So I go into the market , buy € 10 million at face value for at € 0.72 , or € 7.2 million , and return the bond certificates to Goldman Sachs as per our agreement . 
My profit for correctly taking this bearish view is therefore € 1.65m - the € 9.1m I got by selling the bonds when I borrowed them on January 1 , minus the € 7.2m that I had to pay to repurchase them on June 30 , minus the € 250,000 in interest that I had to pay Goldman Sachs for the six-month loan . 
Voilà - a successful &quot; short &quot; trade . 
Of course , a single short seller cannot &quot; make &quot; the price of an asset ( unless he is George Soros , whose famous bet against the British pound in 1992 made him a billionaire and forced Britain out of the European exchange-rate mechanism ) . 
But if a bunch of speculators decide ( rightly or wrongly ) that a government &apos;s debt is overpriced , they can force down its price , thereby forcing up its yield ( the interest rate that the government must pay ) . 
If the attack persists , speculators can force a government to default on its debt , unless it can find a way to finance its borrowing more cheaply . 
The bailout fund created last year by the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank to enable Greece and other distressed sovereigns , like Ireland and now Portugal , does exactly that , but on the condition that they implement austerity programs to eliminate their deficits over a short period of time . 
&quot; Eliminating the deficit &quot; means , quite simply , eliminating a lot of jobs , in both the public and private sectors , whose existence depends on the deficit . 
The economic and human costs of deficit reduction in a weak economy are appalling , and the targets won &apos;t be met , either , because the spending cuts will erode the government &apos;s revenue as aggregate demand falls . 
So what is the role of elected politicians in the face of a speculative attack ? 
Is it simply to accept the market &apos;s will and impose the requisite pain on their people ? 
This would be a reasonable conclusion if financial markets always , or even usually , priced assets correctly . 
But they do no such thing . 
The financial collapse of 2007-2009 was the result of a massive mispricing of assets by private banks and ratings agencies . 
So why should we believe that the markets have been correctly pricing the risk of Greek , Irish , or Portuguese debt ? 
The truth is that these prices are &quot; made &quot; by herd behavior . 
John Maynard Keynes pointed out the reason many years ago : &quot; the extreme precariousness of the basis of knowledge on which our estimates of prospective yield have to be made . &quot; 
When you don &apos;t know what to do , you do what the next person does . 
This is not to deny that some governments have been living beyond their means , and that shorting their debt is how financial markets hold them accountable . 
But , in the last resort , it is voters , not markets , which hold governments to account . 
When these two accounting standards diverge , the popular standard must prevail if democracy is to survive . 
The tension between democracy and finance is at the root of today &apos;s rising discontent in Europe . 
Popular anger at budget cuts imposed at the behest of speculators and bankers has toppled leaders in Ireland and Portugal , and is forcing the Spanish prime minister into retirement . 
Of course , there are other targets : Muslim immigrants , ethnic minorities , bankers &quot; bonuses , the European Commission , the ECB . 
Nationalist parties are gaining ground . 
In Finland , the anti-European True Finns party has shot up from nowhere to the brink of power . 
So far , none of this has shaken democracy , but when enough people become vexed at several things simultaneously , one has the makings of a toxic political brew . 
Nationalism is the classic expression of thwarted democracy . 
For politicians , the important thing is not to avoid taking hard decisions , but to do so of their own volition and at their own pace . 
When an elected government is under assault from the bond markets , it is essential for the political class to remain united . 
It is natural for opposition politicians to want to exploit a government &apos;s difficulties to win power . 
But a fiscal crisis calls for political self-restraint . 
Opposition parties should refrain from shorting their government politically at a time when markets are doing so financially . 
Ideally , there should be a time-limited all-party agreement on a plan of action , which would represent the limit of what is politically feasible . 
Unfortunately , political disunity in the face of financial pressure always ends up being far more damaging to democracy and the economy than instinctive patriotism .
