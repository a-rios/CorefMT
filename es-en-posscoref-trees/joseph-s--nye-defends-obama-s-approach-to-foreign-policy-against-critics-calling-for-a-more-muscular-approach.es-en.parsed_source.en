Obama the Pragmatist 
CAMBRIDGE - Last month , in his address to the graduating cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point , President Barack Obama stated that some of America &apos;s most costly mistakes since World War II were the result not of restraint , but of a &quot; willingness to rush into military adventures without thinking through the consequences . &quot; 
Though Obama may be right , the speech did little to mollify critics who have accused him of passivity and weakness , particularly regarding Syria and Ukraine . 
This frustration can be blamed partly on the impossibly high expectations that Obama set in his early speeches , in which he inspired voters with promises of systemic transformation . 
Unlike most candidates , Obama maintained this transformational rhetoric even after it secured him his victory in the 2008 campaign . 
Indeed , a series of addresses in the first year of his presidency raised expectations even higher , by establishing the goal of a nuclear-weapons-free world , promising to revamp America &apos;s approach to the Middle East , and pledging to &quot; bend history in the direction of justice . &quot; 
It is often said that democratic politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose . 
But there is no reason to believe that Obama was being disingenuous about his objectives . 
His vision simply could not withstand the recalcitrant and difficult world that confronted him ; so he had to adjust . 
After just one year in office , the man who had promised transformational leadership became a &quot; transactional &quot; leader - pragmatic to a fault . 
And , despite what his critics say , this was a positive development . 
While vowing to use force when America &apos;s vital interests are at stake and rejecting pessimistic projections of national decline , Obama has - unlike his predecessor , George W. Bush - relied more heavily on diplomacy than force . 
For this , his critics have accused him of failing to promote American values and retreating into isolationism . 
But restraint is not isolationism . 
No one accused President Dwight Eisenhower of isolationism when he accepted a stalemate in the Korean War , refused to intervene at Dien Bien Phu , resisted recommendations from senior military officers regarding islands near Taiwan , watched the Red Army invade Hungary , or refused to back allies in the Suez Canal crisis . 
Nor did those who now disparage Obama &apos;s measured response to Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s recent annexation of Ukrainian territory call Bush an isolationist for his weak response to Putin &apos;s invasion of Georgia in 2008 . 
In fact , Obama &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s aggression in Ukraine reflects his long-term vision . 
Though Putin has gained possession of Crimea , he has lost access to some of the resources that he needs to achieve his goal of restoring Russia &apos;s former glory as a great power - and has reinvigorated NATO in the process . 
Effective foreign policymaking requires an understanding of not only international and transnational systems , but also the intricacies of domestic politics in multiple countries . 
It also demands recognition of just how little is known about &quot; building nations , &quot; particularly after revolutions - a process that should be viewed in terms of decades , not years . 
In 1789 , few observers in Paris would have predicted that a Corsican would lead French forces to the banks of the Nile within ten years . 
And foreign intervention in the French Revolution only fanned nationalist flames . 
In such a complex and uncertain context , prudence is critical , and bold action based on a grandiose vision can be extremely dangerous . 
This is what advocates of a more muscular approach to today &apos;s revolutions in the Middle East often forget . 
Of course , it makes sense for US leaders to nudge events at the margins in an effort to advance democratic values in the long term . 
But attempting to direct revolutions that they do not fully understand would be a mistake , with potentially serious negative consequences for all parties involved . 
In fact , in the twentieth century , US presidents who pursued transformational foreign policies were neither more effective nor more ethical . 
Woodrow Wilson &apos;s bet on the Versailles Treaty of 1919 contributed to the disastrous isolationism of the 1930 &quot; s . 
And the bets that John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson made in Vietnam had devastating consequences , some of which are still being felt today . 
More recently , George W. Bush - who famously declared that he did not play &quot; small ball &quot; - attempted to transform the Middle East with his &quot; freedom agenda . &quot; 
More than a decade later , the US is still struggling to withdraw from the conflicts that he initiated . 
Obama &apos;s foreign-policy mistakes , by contrast , have had only modest repercussions . 
To use Obama &apos;s own baseball metaphor , aiming for achievable singles and doubles is often a more effective strategy than swinging wildly in an effort to hit a home run , only to strike out . 
Of course , a game-winning home run is exciting . 
But a foreign-policy &quot; victory &quot; is not quite as straightforward - and the stakes are far higher . 
President George H. W. Bush understood this . 
A transactional leader , he famously stated that he did not do &quot; the vision thing . &quot; 
But , like Eisenhower , he steered the US through multiple crises , overseeing one of the more successful periods of US foreign policy in the last half-century . 
Of course , some of the criticism of Obama &apos;s speech was valid . 
But much of it was just partisan politics . 
To be constructive , the debate about Obama &apos;s foreign policy must account for twentieth-century US history . 
In foreign policy , as in medicine , leaders must &quot; first do no harm . &quot; 
Obama understands that . 
One hopes that the relentless uninformed criticism that his pragmatic policies have elicited does not drive his successor to revert to a risky transformational approach .
