The Contradictions of China &apos;s Communist Capitalism 
BERKELEY - The recent dizzying plunge in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges has posed a unique test for China &apos;s Communist rulers . 
So long as the markets were rising , the paradox of vigorous capitalist development overseen by the world &apos;s largest and strongest Communist party confounded only academics and old-school Marxists . 
As the Chinese Communist Party elite and their relatives , foreign financial institutions , and some Chinese small investors ( enabled by margin lending ) made money on stocks , no one bothered to comprehend the mutant creature they were milking . 
But now , as the realization sinks in that Chinese stock prices will not keep rising indefinitely , the CCP is taking desperate , if clumsy , measures to control the correction . 
All new initial public offerings have been halted , and much trading has been curtailed ; the central bank has been asked to help the China Securities Finance Corporation induce investors to buy shares and thus stabilize the market . 
Indeed , even the country &apos;s sovereign wealth fund has gotten into the act . 
But , unlike in other capitalist economies , money is not the only tool at the authorities &quot; disposal . 
If your brokers in China advise you to sell shares , they must be careful not to appear to be rumormongers , subject to official punishment . 
And there are reports that sales of large holdings may trigger investigations by the authorities . 
Causing public disorder or financial instability can be a serious offense in China , where conspiracy theories about foreigners &quot; efforts to undermine the economy abound . 
What Chinese officials desire is a capitalist stock market without the possibility of large losses that can shake confidence in the CCP &apos;s credibility and control . 
But that is a market that no one has yet invented . 
And now , their weight is perhaps becoming too heavy for the Party hierarchy to bear . 
Indeed , the composition of the CCP is itself a contradiction . 
The revolutionary party of peasants and workers is now dominated by businessmen , college students , and professionals . 
One-third of the people listed in the Hurun Report , the Shanghai-based monitor of China &apos;s wealthiest people , are Party members . 
The average wealth of the richest 70 members of the National People &apos;s Congress , China &apos;s parliament , far exceeds $ 1 billion . 
( The richest 70 members of India &apos;s parliament or even the US Congress , both now controlled by right-wing political parties , are substantially less wealthy . ) 
Of course , President Xi Jinping &apos;s recent drive against corruption high and low has made many Communist Party plutocrats jittery . 
Ordinary Chinese generally support the anti-corruption drive ; it is they who usually initiate protests and point fingers at dishonest officials . 
In 2008 , for example , following the Sichuan earthquake , thousands of children died when their shoddily built schools collapsed . 
For a while , tales of corruption in the schools &quot; construction dominated even the official news . 
In the end , however , it was the protesting parents and teachers of the dead children who were detained and harassed by the state . 
What the CCP refuses to recognize is that corruption cannot be rooted out as long as the Party maintains its monopoly on political power ; with no organized opposition or functioning civil-society institutions , officials will continue to use their positions of public authority as a vehicle to generate personal wealth . 
The Third Plenum of the 18th Party Congress gave primacy to the principle of market competition ; but , as a senior Chinese banker commented in a related context some years back : &quot; It &apos;s quite hard to compete when you &apos;re playing against the referee . &quot; 
That observation extends to the rule of law and constitutionalism . 
Under Xi , the CCP has repeatedly insisted that the rule of law is a &quot; core socialist value &quot; and has pledged to promote the authority of the constitution . 
Yet the rule of law in the Party &apos;s eyes is a law that it dictates , interprets , and enforces . 
Chinese citizens &quot; references to the constitution ( especially article 35 , which guarantees freedom of speech , press , assembly , and association ) and constitutionalism in general are routinely censored , and lawyers who cite the constitution in court are frequently detained . 
Mao famously speculated on the nature of contradictions in a 1937 essay : &quot; The law of contradiction in things , that is , the law of the unity of opposites , is the fundamental law of nature and of society . &quot; 
One wonders , though , if even he could have grasped , much less managed , the contradictions of communist capitalism .
