Mercosur Blues 
SANTIAGO - When the leaders of Mercosur met in Caracas this week , the usual bluster about standing up to imperialism filled the air . 
Mercosur is usually described as a trade grouping ; in fact , it has been a political creation from the start . 
Brazil , the regional powerhouse , always viewed it as a counterweight to the United States in hemispheric affairs . 
Peronist governments in Argentina used it to hype integration while doing little or nothing to remove actual barriers to trade . 
With the entrance of Hugo Chávez &apos;s Venezuela in 2006 , the lurch toward populism became unmistakable . 
As a Chilean government minister late last decade , I remember the frustration of attending Mercosur gatherings ( Chile is an associate member ) . 
At the 2006 summit in Córdoba , when Chávez and Fidel Castro dueled over who could deliver the longest and most rambling address , spirits were running high . 
Bolivia , also governed by a charismatic populist , was keen to develop closer ties . 
And a smattering of smaller countries in Central America and the Caribbean fell into political line in exchange for generous infusions of Venezuelan cash and oil . 
Back then , Mercosur leaders could claim to offer an &quot; alternative development model &quot; for the region . 
No more . 
This week in Caracas , the mood was funereal . 
The host , Chávez &apos;s successor Nicolás Maduro , confronts a collapsing economy and tensions within his own party . 
Despite relatively high oil prices , Venezuela has a large fiscal deficit and falling foreign-exchange reserves . 
The inflation rate is the region &apos;s highest , and the economy is stagnating . 
In the face of popular frustration with worsening living conditions , Maduro &apos;s government has relied on violent repression to put an end to street protests . 
Opposition leader Leopoldo López spent months in a military prison before recently being put on trial . 
Institutions like Human Rights Watch have repeatedly denounced the government &apos;s rights violations and restrictions on civil liberties . 
Argentina &apos;s president , Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , arrived in Caracas hoping to rouse support in her fight against the so-called vulture funds that bought her country &apos;s sovereign bonds on the cheap and have successfully sued for payment in full . 
But Fernández found that her colleagues &quot; polite words of encouragement mattered little . 
The US Supreme Court &apos;s decision last month to uphold a lower court &apos;s ruling against Argentina put her in an impossible situation . 
Paying the recalcitrant bondholders would mean losing face and possibly triggering a salvo of copycat lawsuits ; not paying would mean technical default and all of its attendant costs . 
She chose the latter option . 
Access to foreign capital matters for Fernández , because , like Maduro , she faces a stalled economy and a growing dollar shortage . 
Domestic stabilization measures earlier this year bought her some time , yet fear of a recession remains . 
In an effort to regain access to capital markets , her economic team patched up things with the Paris Club of sovereign creditors and Spain &apos;s Repsol ( the former owner of nationalized oil giant YPF ) ; but the fight with the vultures has set the country back . 
With a presidential election looming in October 2015 , most potential candidates ( even those from her own party ) are quickly distancing themselves from her authoritarian style and troubled economic legacy . 
In Bolivia , President Evo Morales has resorted to legal and constitutional shenanigans to guarantee himself yet another term in office . 
After two terms , Morales would in theory be prohibited from running again . 
But Bolivia &apos;s constitutional court has ruled that he can , because the adoption of a new constitution redefined the country as the Plurinational State of Bolivia ; 
Morales , therefore , served his first term as the head of a different state . 
In Ecuador , too , democratic institutions are under siege . 
An independent report has chronicled 12 separate episodes of government meddling with court rulings . 
A controversial gag law on the press that was enacted last year has already ended a major newspaper &apos;s print edition . 
According to Catalina Botero , the outgoing rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission , &quot; Ecuador is , along with Cuba , the country that most restricts freedom of expression . &quot; 
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff faces a situation that is both similar to and different from that of her Mercosur colleagues . 
Brazil is not the kind of country where a president can manipulate the constitution or close newspapers at will . 
But malaise is in the air in Brasilia ( leaving aside the World Cup thrashing delivered by Germany ) . 
Brazil &apos;s swift recovery from the 2008 financial crisis endeared it to international financial markets ; but weak growth since then has left yesterday &apos;s promise unfulfilled . 
Despite low unemployment , economic anxiety is on the rise - and is beginning to filter to the political realm . 
With Rousseff dropping in the polls and her opponents slowly gaining , the October presidential election - once thought to be a done deal - may be up for grabs . 
Absent from the Caracas summit was Chile &apos;s president , Michelle Bachelet , who blamed a cold and a busy domestic agenda for her inability to travel . 
Political complications linked to a possible meeting with the Venezuelan opposition , which Bachelet had chosen not to attend ( preferring to send her foreign minister ) , likely also played a part . 
Rousseff and Bachelet were natural candidates to lead the development of a moderate counterweight to the populism of Maduro , Fernández , Morales , and Correa . 
But Rousseff , like her predecessor , the popular Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , has chosen not to fill that role , instead cozying up to Venezuela . 
Chile is too small to go it alone , and Bachelet has her hands full with increasingly controversial tax , education , and constitutional reforms . 
Uruguay &apos;s president , José Mujica , offered the best summary of what happened in Caracas : &quot; We issued a statement . &quot; 
In other words , Mercosur remains an irrelevant talking shop - and the emergence of a modern center-left regional leadership in Latin America will have to wait .
