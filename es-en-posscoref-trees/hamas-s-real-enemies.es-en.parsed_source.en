Hamas &apos;s Real Enemies 
JERUSALEM - In Iran , elements from within the regime are reportedly offering a $ 1 million reward for the assassination of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak because of his opposition to Hamas in the Gaza Strip . 
In Lebanon , the leader of Hezbollah , backed by Iran and Syria , merely calls for the Egyptian government &apos;s overthrow . 
In response to this , Tariq Alhomayed , a Saudi who is editor-in-chief of the newspaper Al-Sharq al-Awsat , describes Hamas as Iran &apos;s tool , and argues that &quot; Iran is a real threat to Arab security . &quot; 
Egypt &apos;s foreign minister , Ahmed Aboul Gheit , agrees - and he is not alone . 
When Arab states met to discuss the Gaza crisis , Saudi Arabia vetoed any action . 
Even the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) blames Hamas for the fighting . 
Activists in Fatah , Hamas &apos;s nationalist rival which runs the PA , make no secret of their hope that Hamas loses the war . 
Welcome to the new Middle East , characterized no longer by the Arab-Israeli conflict , but by an Arab nationalist-Islamist conflict . 
Recognizing this reality , virtually all Arab states - other than Iran &apos;s ally , Syria - and the PA want to see Hamas defeated in the Gaza Strip . 
Given their strong self-interest in thwarting Islamist revolutionary groups , especially those aligned with Iran , they are not inclined to listen to the &quot; Arab street &quot; - which is far quieter than it was during previous conflicts , such as the 1991 war in Kuwait , the 2000-2004 Palestinian uprising , or the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war . 
Today &apos;s Middle East is very different from the old one in many significant ways . 
First , the internal politics of every Arab country revolves around a battle between Arab nationalist rulers and an Islamist opposition . 
In other words , Hamas &apos;s allies are the regimes &quot; enemies . 
An Islamist state in the Gaza Strip would encourage those who seek to create similar entities in Egypt , Jordan , and every other Arab country . 
Already , a tremendous price has been paid in lives and treasure for this conflict . 
The violence has included civil wars among Palestinians and Algerians ; the bloodshed in Iraq ; and terrorist campaigns in Egypt and Saudi Arabia . 
In the Palestinian case , after winning an election victory and making a deal with Fatah for a coalition government , Hamas turned on its nationalist rivals and drove them out of Gaza by force . 
In return , the PA has been repressing Hamas in the West Bank . 
In Lebanon , Hezbollah has been trying to bully its more moderate Sunni Muslim , Christian , and Druze rivals into submission . 
Second , because Arab states confront an Iran-Syria alliance that includes Hamas and Hezbollah , in addition to internal conflicts , there is a regional battle between these two blocs . 
An aspect of this is that the largely Sunni Muslim-led states face a largely Shia Muslim-led competitor for regional hegemony . 
These two problems pose far greater dangers to the existing states than does any ( largely fabricated ) Israeli threat , and the region &apos;s rulers know it . 
On the other side of the divide , Iran and its allies have put forward the banners of jihad and &quot; resistance . &quot; 
Their platform includes : Islamist revolution in every country ; 
This is a very ambitious program , probably impossible to achieve . 
Nevertheless , it is a prescription for endless terrorism and war : both pro- and anti-Iranian revolutionary Islamists believe that , because God is on their side and their enemies are cowardly , they will win , and they are quite prepared to spend the next half-century trying to prove it . 
While this seems to be a very pessimistic assessment of the regional situation , the radical Islamist side has many weaknesses . 
Launching losing wars may make Islamists feel good , but being defeated is a costly proposition , for their arrogance and belligerence antagonizes many who might otherwise be won over to their cause . 
In addition , the situation provides a good opportunity for Western policymakers . 
The emphasis should be on building coalitions among the relatively moderate states that are threatened by radical Islamist forces , and on working hard to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons - a goal that is in the interests of many in the region . 
The worst mistake would be to follow the opposite policy - an inevitably futile effort to appease the extremists or seek to moderate them . 
Such a campaign actually disheartens the relative moderates who , feeling sold out , will try to cut their own deal with Tehran . 
The current crisis in Gaza is only one aspect of the much wider battle shaking the region . 
Helping Hamas would empower radical Islamism and Iranian ambitions , while undercutting the PA and everyone else , not just Israel . 
Arab states don &apos;t want to help their worst enemy . 
Why should anyone else ?
