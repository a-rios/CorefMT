Oily Dirt 
EDMONTON - Calm discussion of the environment nowadays is about as plausible as reasoned dialogue on witchcraft in colonial Massachusetts . 
Consider the hyperbolic debate over the Keystone XL pipeline , which would funnel oil from Canada &apos;s Athabasca tar sands in northeastern Alberta to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast . 
The Alberta government - and the oil companies that influence it - would upgrade &quot; tar sands &quot; to &quot; oil sands , &quot; apparently thinking that a better name somehow silences environmental critics . 
Environmentalists opposing the pipeline refer , with equal deftness , to &quot; dirty oil . &quot; 
Bystanders understandably wonder which is worse - awkward rebranding or awkward puns . 
Neither gaucherie is entirely deceptive . 
The tar sands are hundreds of square kilometers of bitumen , a viscous and corrosive tarlike deposit . 
Bitumen permeates the dirt at the surface or , where thin layers of compost and sediment intervene , somewhat below basement levels . 
Grasping a handful of dirt from a riverbank does leave one &apos;s hand more oily than tarred , and the greasy dirt is somewhat sandy . 
This highlights the real deception by both sides . 
Awkwardly for oil companies , bitumen is not ordinary oil . 
Awkwardly for environmentalists , Nature put corrosive bitumen in the dirt . 
Had BP spilled hundreds of billions of barrels of bitumen across hundreds of square kilometers , environmentalists would rightly demand that no expense be spared to rid the dirt of every trace of oil . 
A double standard applies , because , whatever Nature does is , well , natural , and therefore good . 
Environmentalists &quot; awkwardness is , or ought to be , disconcerting . 
But oil companies &quot; awkwardness is more substantial . 
They remove bitumen from the dirt in two ways . 
An older technology features vast strip mines , huge diggers , and trucks carting oily dirt to industrial-scale pressure cookers that drain off the bitumen . 
A newer technology leaves the surface untouched by pumping steam into the subsoil . 
This heats the bitumen , making it runny enough to be pumped out . 
Both processes leave toxic residues and somewhat less oily dirt . 
They disparage hideous strip mines and toxic tailing ponds that even superstar marketers cannot &quot; greenwash . &quot; The scale is unusual , but open-pit mines and tailing ponds are normal mining operations everywhere . 
Moreover , the newer bitumen technology does without strip mines . 
Environmentalists correctly note that producing heat for either process uses more energy than does overcoming gravity to pump up ordinary oil . 
Burning natural gas to heat oily dirt releases large amounts of carbon dioxide , exacerbating global warming . 
Unfortunately , biodiesel from soy is little better on this count ; and California heavy oil and farm ethanol are both far worse . 
We are running a global experiment while living in a test tube . 
US President Barack Obama has a limited opportunity to preserve the bitumen companies &quot; integrity . 
They want to access the American market and use Gulf Coast ports to export more widely , but Keystone XL is not their only option . 
If Obama blocks the pipeline , they will build others , and other export facilities - if not on Canada &apos;s environmentally delicate Pacific coast , then at some already-industrialized Atlantic port . 
These developments will come anyway , and , once they do , the United States will become a mere bystander . 
By offering conditional approval of the Keystone XL , Obama could advance the pipeline &apos;s very genuine diplomatic and economic benefits , while reducing its environmental costs . 
The benefits are huge . 
Flooding global markets with Canadian oil would constrain global oil prices . 
More important , it would advance the cause of peace . 
Addiction to Middle East oil distorts foreign policies , causes wars , and ravages the environment . 
Recall how Iraqi soldiers retreating from Kuwait in 1991 set hundreds of wellheads ablaze . 
The infernos spewed CO2 into the air and flaming oil across delicate desert ecosystems for months . 
War is not green . 
America cannot realistically expect its allies - let alone countries like Iran and Venezuela , with which its relations are strained - to adopt principled foreign policies when Middle East Realpolitik distorts its own foreign policy . 
In the short term , Canadian oil would liberate the US from this hypocrisy . 
In the longer term , were shale gas and oil to satisfy US demand , Canadian oil could wean America &apos;s allies from their Middle East oil addiction , giving them new foreign-policy options , too . 
Obama &apos;s approval should be conditional on Canada enforcing serious environmental safeguards . 
Many bitumen companies claim that they already abide by such safeguards ; but environmentalists &quot; skepticism is justified . 
Only strong regulations , transparency , and severe penalties can create a level playing field . 
One obvious condition is mandatory CO2 &quot; sequestration &quot; ( removing CO2 from the air and storing it deep underground ) . 
Mandatory sequestration could make net CO2 emissions from bitumen extraction no worse than those from conventional oil wells , and perhaps even better . 
Another obvious condition is mandatory timetables for restoring strip mines and tailing ponds to their natural condition . 
The companies want the bitumen that Nature put in the oily dirt . 
Let them take it , but let &apos;s also ensure they leave no worse a mess than Nature intended .
