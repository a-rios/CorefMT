Nigeria &apos;s Resurgent Oil Diplomacy 
Russia is not alone in seeing oil as a means to transform its global standing . 
Nowadays , the mantra of President Umar Yar &apos;Adua , who took power in June 2007 , following controversial elections , is to transform the country into one of the world &apos;s 20 largest economies by 2020 . 
Yar &apos;Adua and his Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) are struggling to stamp their authority on an unwieldy and restive country of 140 million people , and the government views rapid growth as a means to achieving that aim . 
Nigerians can use a dose of hope . 
Olusegun Obasanjo , who became Nigeria &apos;s first elected president in 1999 after nearly two decades of military dictatorship , left vast swathes of the country trapped in poverty when he handed power to Yar &apos;Adua last year . 
With oil reaching $ 100 dollars per barrel , and energy-hungry giants like the United States and China beating a path to Nigeria &apos;s door , Africa &apos;s leading oil producer wants to use petrodollars to cure the country &apos;s economic ills and flex its muscles in the international arena . 
While riding the crest of the last oil boom in the late 1970 &quot; s , Nigeria &apos;s military leaders nationalized the assets of British Petroleum and became champions of pan-African co-operation , financing several African liberation movements . 
The interests of the West and Nigeria repeatedly clashed , but Nigeria always stood its ground . 
Inept government and economic decline in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s obliged Nigeria &apos;s leaders to focus on problems closer to home , like the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone . 
But old habits die hard . 
Nigeria has always sought a leadership role in Africa and its diaspora . 
Even in the turbulent 1990 &quot; s , when Nigeria was temporarily suspended from the British Commonwealth following the execution of minority rights campaigner Ken Saro-Wiwa by General Sani Abacha &apos;s regime , the governing elite sought to achieve Nigeria &apos;s &quot; rightful &quot; place in global affairs . 
There are now signs of a resurgent oil-driven foreign policy . 
Last October , Yar &apos;Adua joined South Africa and Libya in opposing US plans to deploy AFRICOM , its new African regional military command , on the continent . 
He then asked Nigeria &apos;s National Assembly to write off $ 13 million of Liberia &apos;s $ 43 million bilateral debt after Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf withdrew her offer to host the new command . 
Nigerian officials are careful to disavow any link between this financial gift and Johnson &apos;s turn away from AFRICOM . 
Nor do they voice their concern that AFRICOM could be part of an American effort to exert control on West Africa &apos;s oil-producing countries . 
But , in confidential briefings , Nigeria has strongly hinted that it will not tolerate any foreign incursions on a vital and strategic resource in its own backyard . 
Domestically , the renewed flexing of Nigeria &apos;s foreign policy muscles is being played out in the ongoing face-off between the new National Energy Council , which reports to the President , and Western oil companies , led by Shell &apos;s Nigerian subsidiary , over when to end production-related gas flaring . 
The government insists on a January 2008 deadline , but the companies complain that the government &apos;s reluctance to fund its share of operating costs fully and rising political violence in the Niger Delta make this deadline unrealistic , and want it extended three years . 
The Department of Petroleum Resources ( DPR ) , the regulatory agency for the oil industry , has dismissed these claims , vowing to impose hefty fines on companies that flout the deadline . 
In the early 1990 &quot; s , desperately short of hard currency , Nigeria negotiated contracts permitting the oil companies to develop new fields and recoup their investment before sharing profits . 
Now , following the companies &quot; discovery of massive reserves , technocrats appointed by Yar &apos;Adua to take charge of oil policy want Nigeria to get a larger slice of the pie . 
That also means ending government co-financing of operating costs and demanding that the oil companies tap capital markets to bridge the shortfall . 
Moreover , Tony Chukwueke , the DPR &apos;s head , has announced plans to create an African version of Petronas , Malaysia &apos;s state-run oil company , and transform the sclerotic Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation into a powerful oil-producing firm that can dominate the market in the Gulf of Guinea and other emerging regions . 
Intense Western pressure has been brought to bear on Yar &apos;Adua to re-consider the January deadline . 
His election is being challenged in court by other candidates , and Western backing could play a role in stabilizing his government . 
But his advisers , some of whom played a key role in shaping Nigeria &apos;s foreign policy in the 1970 &quot; s , are keen to use the gas-flaring issue to demonstrate Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s resolve and standing as a pan-African leader . 
But , as in the 1970 &quot; s , the success of Nigerian diplomacy will depend on the government &apos;s ability to win legitimacy at home . 
That will require repairing and improving damaged infrastructure , generating economic prosperity , running efficient social services , and taming the unrest in the delta region . 
It is not yet clear whether Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s government can meet these challenges .
