Rejecting the Power to Waste 
SINGAPORE - Our ancestors preached it . 
Our parents taught it to us . 
The West is adopting it . 
So why are we Asians abandoning it ? 
Switching off a TV that no one is watching . 
Growing up in India in the 1980 &quot; s , our lifestyle was very different from today &apos;s . 
There was hardly any waste generated in a typical household . 
Everything was used and reused until it fell apart . 
We traveled in trains . 
We were reprimanded for wasting food . 
When my parents visited the United States for the first time , I didn &apos;t hear the end of their shock at the excess they saw - from the wastage of paper napkins and plastic cutlery at fast-food restaurants to the average household &apos;s usage of cars and electricity . 
At the time , as a young Indian recently relocated to the West , I didn &apos;t want to be associated with stodgy parents who patiently folded used wrapping paper and stored it under their mattress . 
Losing touch with that wisdom was , perhaps , understandable . 
As India &apos;s economic boom has transformed it from a global laggard into one of the world &apos;s key emerging powers , the new generation of Indians finally arrived - in business , science , and politics . 
Indian diasporas in the United States , the United Kingdom , and Southeast Asia are among the richest communities in these countries . 
We don &apos;t want to reuse paper bags anymore . 
We don &apos;t even want to be seen conserving . 
We now have the power to waste , and we want to flaunt it . 
The same change in mindset can be seen in other emerging Asian economies . 
Conservation is regarded as a sign of weakness in this era of rising economic wealth . 
The desire to claim one &apos;s rightful place under the sun - to share the planet equally - is a driving force throughout the region , from Southeast Asia to Korea and China . 
Why should we conserve ? 
The West was responsible for all the pollution and waste in the first place . 
It is our turn now to ruin the planet , and no one should try to stop us . 
Unfortunately while we are queuing up for our BMWs , the rules of the game changed . 
The new lifestyle is no longer sustainable . 
It &apos;s the end of the road for gas-guzzling cars , glass apartments that need constant air conditioning , water-thirsty washing machines , and wasteful packaging . 
By 2050 , Earth &apos;s population will be more than nine billion , and more than two-thirds will live in urban areas . 
We cannot survive the lifestyle that we desire . 
There is an opportunity here for leadership . 
Infosys is redesigning every aspect of how it provides lighting , cooling , water , and transportation to their more than 100,000 employees , and aiming to reduce costs ten-fold in the process . 
The Indian army is using solar steam cooking in Ladakh to cook for the 500 jawans ( young army recruits ) stationed there , and so is the Shirdi Sai Baba temple in Maharashtra . 
Elsewhere , prisons in Rwanda are using their 30,000 inmates &quot; sewage to provide biogas for cooking and compost for growing vegetables . 
Sunlabob , a private company in Laos , is renting solar lanterns to poor villagers , who find them more affordable than candles . 
The UAE is spending a chunk of its oil money to develop Masdar , the world &apos;s first zero-carbon , zero-waste city . 
Singapore is using Newater , a treated form of wastewater that is potable . 
But some are falling behind in this thinking , namely well-to-do Asian households - and some Asian governments . 
Just five years from now , developing countries are projected to emit more greenhouse gases than all developed countries . 
We can either shrug our shoulders , or we can use the opportunity to revive our old values , rethink how we live , and change that projection . 
Whether it is through low-energy housing , planting trees , teaching children to respect the environment , boycotting incandescent lightbulbs , or wrapping gifts in old newspapers , we have the opportunity to lead by example . 
Governments , too , should collaborate with their developing-country counterparts to provide much-needed leadership in the climate-change debate . 
Asia must leapfrog the unsustainable stage of development . 
We already have a deep-rooted tradition of conservation . 
Reclaiming it would make Asians trendsetters , and make the Asian way of life an example for others to follow .
