The Banking Conundrum 
BARCELONA - Central bankers and regulators tend to worry that too much competition in the financial sector increases instability and the risk of systemic failure . 
Competition authorities , on the other hand , tend to believe that the more competition , the better . 
Both can &apos;t be right . 
There is a trade-off between competition and stability . 
Indeed , greater competitive pressure may increase the fragility of banks &quot; balance sheets and make investors more prone to panics . 
It may also erode the charter value of institutions . 
A bank with thin margins and limited liability does not have much to lose , and will tend to gamble - a tendency that is exacerbated by deposit insurance and too-big-to-fail policies . 
The result will be more incentives to assume risk . 
Indeed , for banks close to the failure point in liberalized systems , the evidence of perverse risk-taking incentives is overwhelming . 
That is why crises began to increase in number and severity after financial systems in the developed world started to liberalize in the 1970 &quot; s , beginning in the United States . 
This new vulnerability stands in stark contrast to the stability of the over-regulated post-World War II period . 
The crises in the US in the 1980 &quot; s ( caused by the savings-and-loan institutions known as &quot; thrifts &quot; ) , and in Japan and Scandinavia in the 1990 &quot; s , showed that financial liberalization without proper regulation induces instability . 
In an ideal world , the competition-stability trade-off could be regulated away with sophisticated risk-based insurance mechanisms , credible liquidation and resolution procedures , contingent convertibles , and capital requirements with charges for systemic institutions . 
The problem is that regulation is unlikely to eliminate completely market failures : the competition-stability trade-off can be ameliorated , but not eliminated . 
For example , the United Kingdom &apos;s Independent Commission on Banking ( ICB ) has proposed ring-fencing retail activities from investment-banking activities in separately capitalized divisions of a bank holding company . 
This is a compromise aimed at minimizing the incentive to gamble with public insurance while allowing some economies of scale for banking activities . 
But the devil is in the details , and , even in the most optimistic scenario , the trade-off between competition and stability will remain . 
One shortcoming of the measure consists in the fact that the crisis has hit both universal and specialized banks . 
Furthermore , the definition of the boundary between retail and investment-banking activities will leave an important grey area and generate perverse incentives . 
And the regulatory boundary problem persists : risky activities may migrate to areas where regulation is lax and reproduce the problems with the shadow banking system that we have witnessed during the crisis . 
As a result , investment-banking operations might need to be rescued if they pose a systemic threat . 
The massive regulatory failure exposed by the financial crisis that began in 2008 underscores the need to concentrate on reforms that provide the correct incentives to banks . 
But , if the past is any guide to the future , we should be aware of the limits of regulation . 
The UK &apos;s ICB has rightly stated that there is room to improve both competition and stability , given the current weak regulatory framework , but it would be imprudent to strive for the complete elimination of market power in banking . 
The design of optimal regulation has to take into account the intensity of competition in the different banking segments . 
For example , capital charges should account for the degree of friction and rivalry in the banking sector , with tighter requirements in more competitive contexts . 
It follows , then , that prudential regulation and competition policy in banking should be coordinated . 
This is all the more true in crisis situations , in which a protocol of collaboration should be implemented to delineate liquidity help from recapitalization , and to establish the conditions for restructuring in order to avoid competitive distortions . 
What implications does this have for market structure ? 
Concentration in well-defined deposit and loan markets is linked with competitive pressure . 
The crisis has affected both concentrated banking systems ( for example , the UK and the Netherlands ) and non-concentrated systems ( e.g. , the US and Germany ) . 
In both cases , it has brought consolidation , leaving fewer players with increased market power and too-big-to-fail status . 
Witness the takeover by Lloyds TSB of the troubled HBOS ( Halifax / Bank of Scotland ) in the UK , or post-crisis consolidation in the US . 
All this would not be so problematic if the increased market power of the merged institutions were a temporary reward for past prudent behavior . 
In that case , the benefits would wane in importance as new competitors entered the banking fray . 
But if banks &quot; market power increases due to barriers to entry , consumers and investors will suffer . 
An active competition policy will be needed . 
But the degree to which the authorities will be able to push for more competition in banking will depend crucially on the regulatory framework . 
Let us fix and strengthen that framework , while bearing in mind that a simple mandate to maximize competitive pressure in banking is no more possible , or desirable , than one that would aim at eliminating instability completely .
