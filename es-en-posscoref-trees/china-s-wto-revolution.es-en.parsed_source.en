China \ u0027s WTO Revolution 
China &apos;s accession to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) is the most important event in the country &apos;s history since the inception of its &quot; open door &quot; economic policy a quarter-century ago . 
Trade liberalization will benefit consumers , small entrepreneurs , and foreign investors . 
But for China &apos;s peasants , WTO membership appears to pose a direct and immediate threat to the tremendous gains made since Deng Xiaoping &apos;s agricultural reforms in the late 1970s . 
The fear felt by China &apos;s peasants is understandable because it is deeply rooted in China &apos;s history and politics . 
Since the founding of the People &apos;s Republic in 1949 , the peasantry has been the country &apos;s most under-represented and manipulated social group , bearing the brunt of the Communists &apos; promotion of heavy industry . 
But WTO membership does not come at the expense of agriculture , for it promises to erode rather than reinforce the peasantry &apos;s legacy of discrimination and powerlessness . 
It is a legacy built on deception . 
During China &apos;s civil war in the late 1940s , the promise of land reform attracted tens of millions of landless peasants to support the Communists . 
After the founding of the People &apos;s Republic , they did receive land , only to see it taken back when the new regime embarked on its massive agricultural collectivization drive . 
The harshness of the subsequent industrialization campaign culminated in the Great Leap Forward of 1958-60 , producing a famine that killed 30 million people , mostly in rural areas . 
By the time Mao Zedong died , in 1976 , the rural economy was a shambles . 
In desperation , village leaders in Anhui province initiated an experiment that returned land to peasants-a de facto privatization that violated official policy . 
The government , believing that the situation in the countryside could not get worse , did not stop them . 
These village experiments with private ownership were highly successful , boosting agricultural output significantly . 
Indeed , it was the peasantry that fired the first shot in the reform campaign that has transformed China in the decades since . 
Mindful of the bitter memory of famine ( and trade embargoes ) , China &apos;s government remains obsessed with ensuring self-sufficiency in food . 
But despite owning the means of production such as land and tools , Chinese peasants have not achieved the social and political status accorded industrial workers in state-owned sectors - people who , according to the constitution , remain the official &quot; vanguard &quot; class . 
The government erected trade barriers and adopted other measures to protect China &apos;s agriculture , but this reflects its concern for factory workers , not-as in the US and Europe-farmers &apos; political clout . 
Inefficient and loss-making state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) remain the primary beneficiaries of official economic policy , kept alive on a drip-feed of government subsidies and cheap loans from state-owned banks . 
Township and village enterprises ( TVEs ) -which are owned by and employ mostly former peasants-had to rely on themselves to become the most dynamic and productive sources of China &apos;s economic growth . 
WTO membership will expose China &apos;s agricultural sector to foreign competition . 
Rural labor will be displaced and the agricultural sector as a whole may experience net job losses . 
But the WTO-induced expansion of non-agricultural labor-intensive sectors , particularly the textile and clothing industries , could absorb these workers . 
Today , peasants move to seek new and better employment opportunities created by economic liberalization . 
Free internal migration has become a fait accompli , effectively shunting aside China &apos;s apartheid-like system of residency permits . 
WTO membership will also force the government to cease discriminating in favor of SOEs and against economic sectors with a high degree of private ownership , including agriculture . 
China &apos;s industrialization strategy in the pre-reform era rejected the notion of &quot; comparative advantage &quot; - the principle that an economy produces some goods more efficiently than others owing to factors such as natural resources , geography , and climate . 
Jamaica , say , does not produce frozen salmon or hockey players because investing in industries such as citrus fruit and tourism provides far more certain profits . 
The same WTO-induced sectoral adjustment underlies the decline of steel and textiles in advanced countries such as the US . 
In China , most SOEs survived because central planners emphasized economic autarky , regardless of cost . 
With trade liberalization , the cost of ignoring comparative advantage soars . 
China &apos;s increasing openness to global competition will eventually jeopardize the SOEs &apos; continued survival and undermine the sustainability of politically biased development schemes . 
With the entry of foreign competitors , China &apos;s state-owned banks will be forced to base lending policy on the ability of borrowers to service their debts . 
The bottom line will replace the Party line in determining how investment is allocated . 
With social stability the government &apos;s overwhelming priority , fundamental institutional changes are unlikely to come from within . 
So accession to the WTO may be just the external catalyst China needs , promising the emergence of a level economic playing field , with respect for and protection of property rights , transparent rules and regulations , free and fair competition , and equal participation . 
Although there will be pain , this should benefit many , if not most , social groups . 
It will , at long last , liberate the peasantry from the greatest historical burden it bears-the dead hand of a state that dotes on its inefficient industrial proletariat .
