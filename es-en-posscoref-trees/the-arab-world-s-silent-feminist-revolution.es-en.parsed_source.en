The Arab World &apos;s Silent Feminist Revolution 
MADRID - Arab societies often appear rigid and resistant to change to outsiders , because what they see is these countries &quot; ruling regimes , which mostly do resist development and change . 
But this image is nearly the opposite of reality in Arab societies , where enormous dynamism is opening doors to many types of change , albeit at different speeds and in complex , contradictory ways - particularly when change from below is held back from above . 
Consider Arab women . 
The predominant image is of a passive , exotic , and veiled victim-woman who reacts to events instead of actively participating in them . 
She is an impersonal object of communal stereotypes that sustain cultural prejudices . 
In fact , Arab societies are engaged in a process of immense and irreversible change in which women are playing a crucial role . 
During the last half-century , intense urbanization and feminization of the workforce in all Arab countries has propelled women into the public arena on a massive scale . 
During this period , differences in schooling levels between boys and girls have lessened everywhere - though at different speeds . 
Indeed , in many Arab countries , more girls than boys are now in secondary and higher education , which shows that parents consider their daughters &quot; education to be just as important as that of their sons . 
And all surveys show that young men and women want to study and have a job before they marry . 
( Moreover , they increasingly want to choose their own partner . ) 
At the same time , demographic shifts , along with social and economic factors affecting education and work , are forcing profound change on the traditional model of the Arab family . 
Higher ages for marriage and declining fertility - resulting directly from widening use of artificial contraception - are reducing family size to something much closer to the &quot; nuclear families &quot; of the West . 
The Maghreb region may lead in this regard , but the phenomenon is observable throughout the Arab world , even in the most rigidly conservative states . 
This new family model has gained so much force that it is imposing itself on rural society , too , where the decline of the agrarian economy is accompanied by a strong shift towards smaller families . 
This change is occurring at slightly different speeds across the Arab world , but often it is occurring simultaneously in town and country . 
Not surprisingly , these changes have led to a redistribution of power between old and young - and between men and women . 
We are now witnessing a progressive weakening of patriarchy , reinforced by the shift from traditional to more nuclear families . 
Of course , these changes do not mark a sharp break with the past . 
All change reflects local compromises with tradition and with patriarchal laws , and different rates of adjustment between old and new ways of life . 
The changes , however , are notably weaker and more complex in countries like Palestine and Iraq , owing to the grave conflicts they have been undergoing . 
The dynamics of change in Arab societies are rarely accompanied by change in the political system . 
Most states resist transferring the processes of social transformation into their legal framework . 
They fear , with reason , that extending freedoms and developing individual autonomy within the family - and so weakening patriarchal authority - could lead to a questioning in the public arena of the ideological basis of state power . 
The result is widespread invocation by governments of religious norms , and to a lesser extent references to tradition , in order to legitimize the continuation of patriarchal rule . 
&quot; State feminism &quot; is generally more a demonstration of rhetoric or political symbolism , concerned primarily with projecting a progressive image internationally , than it is a real motor for change . 
Undoubtedly , however , the region &apos;s political authorities , no less than families themselves , will be forced to accept the inconsistencies of the traditional model when it comes to the transformation of the condition of women . 
This change will affect many others , and it must be analyzed from an Arab perspective , as well as from outside that perspective . 
This is particularly necessary because the situation of women is one of the main benchmarks that the outside world , and particularly the West , uses to assess the Arab world . 
And , unfortunately , such assessments tend to focus on the supposed immobilism that derives from Islamic norms , which obscures knowledge of the real changes that are taking place . 
Indeed , the predominant view of Arab societies often stifles outsiders &quot; ability to break free of their belief that Islam confines all Arab women in the same way , when in reality they experience very different conditions . 
This prevents many from seeing , much less evaluating , the deep changes taking place in Arab societies - and how women are driving those changes forward . 
The West thus risks depriving itself of an important key to understanding the Arab world today , and as it will be tomorrow .
