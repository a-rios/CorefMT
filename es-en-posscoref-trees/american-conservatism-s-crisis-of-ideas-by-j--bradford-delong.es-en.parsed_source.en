American Conservatism &apos;s Crisis of Ideas 
BERKELEY - On the back left corner of my desk right now are three recent books : Arthur Brooks &quot; The Battle , Charles Murray &apos;s Coming Apart , and Nicholas Eberstadt &apos;s A Nation of Takers . 
Together , they constitute an important intellectual movement , which also happens to be a large part of the reason that American conservatism today has little that is constructive to say about managing the economy - and little purchase on the center of the American electorate . 
But let &apos;s back up historically , to the founding of what we might call modern conservatism in early nineteenth-century Britain and France . 
There were some - Frédéric Bastiat and Jean-Baptiste Say come to mind - who believed that government should put the unemployed to work building infrastructure when markets or production were temporarily disrupted . 
But they were balanced by those like Nassau Senior , who spoke out against even famine relief : Although a million people would die in the Irish Potato Famine , &quot; that would scarcely be enough . &quot; 
The main thrust of early conservatism was root-and-branch opposition to every form of social insurance : make the poor richer , and they would become more fertile . 
As a result , farm sizes would drop ( as land was divided among ever more children ) , labor productivity would fall , and the poor would become even poorer . 
Social insurance was not just pointless ; it was counterproductive . 
The proper economic policy was to teach people to venerate the throne ( so that they would respect property ) , the paternal hearth ( so that they would not marry imprudently young ) , and the religious altar ( so that they would fear pre-marital sex ) . 
Then , perhaps , with women chaste for half or more of their childbearing years , the surplus population would diminish and conditions for the poor would be as good as they could be . 
Fast-forward 150 years to post-World War II America , and to the original Chicago School critique of the New Deal version of social insurance - that it created &quot; notches &quot; that perverted economic incentives . 
The government , Milton Friedman and others argued , told the poor : make more money and we will take away your free housing , food stamps , and income support . 
People are rational , Friedman said , so they will not work for long if they get nothing or next to nothing for it . 
The big difference between the Malthusian conservative critics of social insurance in the early nineteenth century and the Chicago critics of the 1970 &quot; s is that the Chicago critics had a point : Providing public support to the &quot; worthy &quot; poor , and then removing it when they began to stand on their own feet , poisoned incentives and was unlikely to lead to good outcomes . 
And so , from 1970 to 2000 , a broad coalition of conservatives ( who wanted to see the government stop encouraging immorality ) , centrists ( who wanted government money spent effectively ) , and leftists ( who wanted poverty alleviated ) removed the &quot; notches &quot; from the social-insurance system . 
Presidents Jimmy Carter , Ronald Reagan , George H. W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and even George W. Bush and their supporters created the current system , in which tax rates and eligibility thresholds are not punitive disincentives to enterprise . 
So what is the problem that America &apos;s new generation of conservative critics of social insurance sees ? 
It is not that raising poor people &apos;s standard of living above bare subsistence produces Malthusian catastrophe , or that taxes and withdrawal of welfare benefits make people work , at the margin , for nothing . 
For Eberstadt , the problem is that dependence on government is emasculating , and that too many people are dependent on government . 
For Brooks , it is that knowing that public programs make one &apos;s life easier causes one to vote for non-Republican candidates . 
For Murray , it is that social insurance means that behaving badly does not lead to catastrophe - and we need bad behavior to lead to catastrophe in order to keep people from behaving badly . 
The crucial point is that America &apos;s conservative elites believe Brooks , Eberstadt , and Murray . 
To this day , Mitt Romney is convinced that he lost the presidency in 2012 because Barack Obama unfairly gave Latino-Americans subsidized health insurance ; gave women free reproductive health coverage ( excluding abortion ) ; and gave other groups similar &quot; gifts . &quot; 
He could &quot; never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives . &quot; 
In fact , it would be a tough sell for any candidate to convince Americans who receive government benefits that they are dependent rather than empowered ; that it is bad for people to vote for politicians who make their lives better ; and that good public policy seeks to create human catastrophe rather than to avert it . 
The problem for American conservatives is not their choice of candidates or the tone of their rhetoric . 
It is that their ideas are not politically sustainable .
