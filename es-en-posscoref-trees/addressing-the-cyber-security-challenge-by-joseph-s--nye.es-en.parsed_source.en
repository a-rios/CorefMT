The Mouse Click that Roared 
CAMBRIDGE - Until recently , cyber security has primarily interested computer geeks and cloak-and-dagger types . 
The Internet &apos;s creators , part of a small , enclosed community , were very comfortable with an open system in which security was not a primary concern . 
But , with some three billion or so users on the Web nowadays , that very openness has become a serious vulnerability ; indeed , it is endangering the vast economic opportunities that the Internet has opened for the world . 
A &quot; cyber attack &quot; can take any number of forms , including simple probes , defacement of Web sites , denial-of-service attacks , espionage , and destruction of data . 
And the term &quot; cyber war , &quot; though best defined as any hostile action in cyberspace that amplifies or is equivalent to major physical violence , remains equally protean , reflecting definitions of &quot; war &quot; that range from armed conflict to any concerted effort to solve a problem ( for example , &quot; war on poverty &quot; ) . 
Cyber war and cyber espionage are largely associated with states , while cyber crime and cyber terrorism are mostly associated with non-state actors . 
The highest costs currently stem from espionage and crime ; but , over the next decade or so , cyber war and cyber terrorism may become greater threats than they are today . 
Moreover , as alliances and tactics evolve , the categories may increasingly overlap . 
Terrorists might buy malware from criminals , and governments might find it useful to hide behind both . 
Some people argue that deterrence does not work in cyberspace , owing to the difficulties of attribution . 
But that is facile : inadequate attribution affects inter-state deterrence as well , yet it still operates . 
Even when the source of an attack can be successfully disguised under a &quot; false flag , &quot; governments may find themselves sufficiently enmeshed in symmetrically interdependent relationships such that a major attack would be counterproductive . 
China , for example , would lose from an attack that severely damaged the American economy , and vice versa . 
An unknown attacker may also be deterred by cyber-security measures . 
If firewalls are strong , or redundancy and resilience allow quick recovery , or the prospect of a self-enforcing response ( &quot; an electric fence &quot; ) seems possible , an attack becomes less attractive . 
While accurate attribution of the ultimate source of a cyber attack is sometimes difficult , the determination does not have to be airtight . 
To the extent that false flags are imperfect and rumors of the source of an attack are widely deemed credible ( though not legally probative ) , reputational damage to an attacker &apos;s soft power may contribute to deterrence . 
Finally , a reputation for offensive capability and a declared policy that keeps open the means of retaliation can help to reinforce deterrence . 
Of course , non-state actors are harder to deter , so improved defenses such as pre-emption and human intelligence become important in such cases . 
But , among states , even nuclear deterrence was more complex than it first looked , and that is doubly true of deterrence in the cyber domain . 
Given its global nature , the Internet requires a degree of international cooperation to be able to function . 
Some people call for the cyber equivalent of formal arms-control treaties . 
But differences in cultural norms and the difficulty of verification would make such treaties hard to negotiate or implement . 
At the same time , it is important to pursue international efforts to develop rules of the road that can limit conflict . 
The most promising areas for international cooperation today most likely concern problems posed for states by third parties such as criminals and terrorists . 
Russia and China have sought to establish a treaty establishing broad international oversight of the Internet and &quot; information security , &quot; which would prohibit deception and embedding malicious code or circuitry that could be activated in the event of war . 
But the US has argued that arms-control measures banning offensive capabilities could weaken defenses against attacks and would be impossible to verify or enforce . 
Likewise , in terms of political values , the US has resisted agreements that could legitimize authoritarian governments &quot; censorship of the Internet - for example , by the &quot; great firewall of China . &quot; 
Moreover , cultural differences impede any broad agreements on regulating online content . 
Nonetheless , it may be possible to identify behaviors like cyber crime that are illegal in many domestic jurisdictions . 
Trying to limit all intrusions would be impossible , but one could start with cyber crime and cyber terrorism involving non-state parties . 
Here , major states would have an interest in limiting damage by agreeing to cooperate on forensics and controls . 
The transnational cyber domain poses new questions about the meaning of national security . 
Some of the most important responses must be national and unilateral , focused on hygiene , redundancy , and resilience . 
It is likely , however , that major governments will soon discover that the insecurity created by non-state cyber actors will require closer cooperation among governments .
