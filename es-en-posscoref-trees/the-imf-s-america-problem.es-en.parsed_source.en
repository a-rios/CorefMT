The IMF &apos;s America Problem 
The IMF &apos;s meeting this spring was lauded as a breakthrough , with officials given a new mandate for &quot; surveillance &quot; of the trade imbalances that contribute significantly to global instability . 
The new mission is crucially important , both for the health of the global economy and the IMF &apos;s own legitimacy . 
But is the Fund up to the job ? 
There is obviously something peculiar about a global financial system in which the richest country in the world , the United States , borrows more than $ 2 billion a day from poorer countries - even as it lectures them on principles of good governance and fiscal responsibility . 
So the stakes for the IMF , which is charged with ensuring global financial stability , are high : if other countries eventually lose confidence in an increasingly indebted US , the potential disturbances in the world &apos;s financial markets would be massive . 
The task facing the IMF is formidable . 
It will , of course , be important for the Fund to focus on global imbalances , not bilateral imbalances . 
In a multilateral trading system , large bilateral trade deficits are often balanced by bilateral surpluses with other countries . 
China might want oil from the Middle East , but those in the Middle East - with so much wealth concentrated in so few hands - might be more interested in Gucci handbags than in China &apos;s mass-produced goods . 
So China can have a trade deficit with the Middle East and a trade surplus with the US , but these bilateral balances indicate nothing about China &apos;s overall contribution to global imbalances . 
The US is jubilant about its success in expanding the IMF &apos;s role , because it thought that doing so would ratchet up pressure on China . 
But America &apos;s glee is shortsighted . 
If one looks at multilateral trade imbalances , the US stands head and shoulders above all others . 
In 2005 , the US trade deficit was $ 805 billion , while the sum of the surpluses of Europe , Japan , and China was only $ 325 billion . 
Any focus on trade imbalances thus should center on the major global imbalance : that of the US . 
The task of assessing trade imbalances - whom to blame and what should be done - involves both economics and politics . 
Trade imbalances are the result , for instance , of household decisions about how much to save and how much - and what - to consume . 
They are also the result of government decisions : how much to tax and spend ( which determines the amount of government savings or deficits ) , investment regulations , exchange-rate policies , and so forth . 
All of these decisions are interdependent . 
For example , America &apos;s huge agriculture subsidies contribute to its fiscal deficit , which translates into a larger trade deficit . 
But agricultural subsidies have consequences for China and other developing countries . 
Were China to revalue its currency , its farmers would be worse off ; but in a world of free ( r ) trade , US farm subsidies translate into lower global agricultural prices , and thus lower prices for Chinese farmers . 
By extending its largesse to rich corporate farms , the US may not have intended to harm the world &apos;s poor , but that is the predictable result . 
This poses a dilemma for Chinese policymakers . 
Subsidizing their own farmers would divert money from education , health , and urgently needed development projects . 
Or China can try to maintain an exchange rate that is slightly lower than it would be otherwise . 
If the IMF is to be evenhanded , should it criticize America &apos;s farm policies or China &apos;s exchange-rate policies ? 
Ascertaining whether a country &apos;s trade imbalances are the result of misguided policies or a natural consequence of its circumstances is also no easy task . 
A country &apos;s trade deficit equals the difference between domestic investment and savings , and developing countries are normally encouraged to save as much as they can . 
Evidently , China &apos;s population has more than responded to such admonitions . 
Stronger safety net programs might reduce the need for precautionary savings in the future , but such reforms cannot be accomplished overnight . 
Investment is high , but further investment growth risks misallocating money , so reductions in China &apos;s trade imbalance may be hard to achieve . 
Moreover , a change in China &apos;s exchange rate would do little to alter the multilateral trade deficit in the US . 
Americans might simply switch from buying Chinese textiles to imports from Bangladesh . 
It is difficult to see how a change in China &apos;s exchange rate would have a significant effect on either savings or investments in the US - and thus how it would redress global imbalances . 
With the US trade deficit the major global imbalance , attention should focus on how to increase its national savings - a question that US governments have struggled with for decades , and one that was frequently debated when I was chair of President Clinton &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers . 
While it &apos;s true that tax preferences might yield slightly higher private savings , the loss of tax revenues would more than offset the gains , thereby actually reducing national savings . 
We found only one solution : reduce the fiscal deficit . 
In short , the US bears responsibility both for trade imbalances and the policies that might quickly be adopted to address them . 
The IMF &apos;s response to its new mission of assessing global imbalances will thus test its battered political legitimacy . 
At its spring meeting , the Fund failed to commit itself to choosing its head on the basis of merit , regardless of nationality , and it did not ensure that voting rights are allocated on a more limited legitimate basis . 
Many of the emerging-market countries , for example , are still underrepresented . 
If the IMF &apos;s analysis of global imbalances is not balanced , if it does not identify the US as the major culprit , and if it does not direct its attention on America &apos;s need to reduce its fiscal deficits - through higher taxes for America &apos;s richest and lower defense spending - the Fund &apos;s relevance in the twenty-first century will inevitably decline .
