Selling America 
A year ago , then United States National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice announced that , &quot; We are engaged primarily in a war of ideas , not of armies . &quot; 
She was right , but it is a war that the US is losing , because it is regularly out-flanked by Al-Qaeda . 
Rising anti-Americanism around the world threatens to deprive the US of the soft or attractive power that it needs to succeed in the struggle against terrorism . 
As Iraq has shown , hard military power alone cannot provide a solution . 
Poll after poll confirms that America &apos;s soft power has declined , particularly in the Islamic world . 
Even in supposedly friendly countries like Jordan and Pakistan , more people say they trust Osama Bin Laden than George Bush . 
Information is power , and today a much larger part of the world &apos;s population has access to it . 
Long gone are the days when US Foreign Service officers drove Jeeps to remote regions of the Third World to show reel-to-reel movies to isolated villagers . 
Technological advances have led to an information explosion , and publics have become more sensitized to propaganda . 
The world is awash in information , some of it accurate , some misleading . 
As a result , politics has become a contest about credibility . 
Whereas the world of traditional power politics is typically defined by whose military or economy wins , politics in an information age is about whose story wins . 
Governments compete with each other and with other organizations to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents . 
Unfortunately , the US government has not kept up . 
Even the Pentagon &apos;s Defense Science Board admits this , reporting that America &apos;s strategic communication &quot; lacks Presidential direction , effective interagency coordination , optimal private sector partnerships , and adequate resources . &quot; 
In the final years of the Clinton administration , Congress mistakenly abolished the US Information Agency and gave its tasks to a new Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy in the State Department . 
This office has subsequently been left vacant or , for two of the past four years , filled on only an interim basis . 
The entire budget for public diplomacy ( broadcasting , information , and exchange programs ) is $ 1.2 billion , about the same as France , or what McDonald &apos;s spends on advertising . 
The US government spends 450 times more on hard military power than on soft power . 
In 1963 , Edward R. Murrow , the famous journalist who directed the US Information Agency in the Kennedy Administration , defined public diplomacy as interactions not only with foreign governments , but primarily with non-governmental individuals and organizations , often presenting a variety of private views in addition to government views . 
Skeptics who treat &quot; public diplomacy &quot; as a euphemism for broadcasting government propaganda miss the point . 
Simple propaganda lacks credibility and thus is counterproductive . 
Public diplomacy , by contrast , involves building long-term relationships . 
Most important in the current situation will be the development of a long-term strategy of cultural and educational exchanges aimed at developing a richer and more open civil society in Middle Eastern countries . 
Given low official credibility , America &apos;s most effective spokesmen will often be non-governmental . 
Indeed , some analysts have even suggested that the US create a non-partisan corporation for public diplomacy that would receive government and private funds , but would stimulate independent cross-border communications . 
Corporations , foundations , universities , and other non-profit organizations can promote much of the work of developing an open civil society . 
Companies and foundations can offer technology to help modernize Arab educational systems and take them beyond rote learning . 
American universities can establish more exchange programs for students and faculty . 
Foundations can support the development of institutions of American studies in Muslim countries , or programs that enhance journalistic professionalism . 
They can support the teaching of English and finance student exchanges . 
In short , there are many strands to an effective long-term strategy for creating soft power resources and promoting conditions for the development of democracy . 
The response to the recent tsunami disaster in Asia is a case in point . 
President George W. Bush pledged - albeit belatedly - $ 350 million in relief to the victims , and sent high-level emissaries to the region . 
There has also been an impressive outpouring of private support by American charities and non-profit organizations . 
The images of US soldiers battling in Iraq have been supplemented by images of America &apos;s military delivering relief to disaster victims . 
But effective follow-up is essential . 
Bush &apos;s prior announcements of increased development assistance and stronger efforts to combat HIV / AIDS in Africa were not only moral imperatives , but also important investments in American soft power . 
Unfortunately , the funds needed to implement these initiatives have not flowed as rapidly as the rhetoric . 
Equally important , none of these efforts at relief or public diplomacy will be effective unless the style and substance of US policies are consistent with a larger democratic message . 
That means that Condoleezza Rice &apos;s chief task as Secretary of State will be to make American foreign policy more consultative in style as she seeks a political solution in Iraq and progress on Middle East peace . 
Only then will she be able to begin the job of repairing America &apos;s tattered reputation by shoring up its neglected public diplomacy .
