Financial Regulators &quot; Global Variety Show 
PARIS - In the early phases of the financial crisis , it was fashionable to argue that the United States &quot; system of regulation needed a fundamental structural overhaul . 
Differences of opinion between the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) had obstructed effective oversight of investment banks and derivatives trading ( only the US believes that it makes sense to regulate securities and derivatives separately ) . 
Indeed , the plethora of separate banking regulators had created opportunities for banks to arbitrage the system in search of a more indulgent approach to capital . 
Likewise , the lack of a federal insurance regulator had left AIG regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) and the New York State Insurance Department , which proved to be a wholly inadequate arrangement . 
Little has come of these arguments . 
The Dodd-Frank Act did succeed in putting the OTS out of its misery , but jealous congressional oversight committees have prevented a merger of the SEC and CFTC , and nothing has been done to rationalize banking supervision . 
So the American system looks remarkably similar to the one that turned a collective blind eye to the rise of fatal tensions in the early 2000 &quot; s . 
One factor that contributed to institutional stasis was the absence of a persuasive alternative . 
In the decade or so leading up to the meltdown of 2007-2008 , the global trend was toward regulatory integration . 
Almost 40 countries had introduced single regulators , merging all types of oversight into a single all-powerful entity . 
The movement began in Scandinavia in the early 1990 &quot; s , but the most dramatic change came in 1997 , when the United Kingdom introduced its Financial Services Authority ( I was its first chairman ) . 
Other countries adopted slightly different models . 
A fashionable approach was known as &quot; twin peaks , &quot; whereby one regulator handled prudential regulation - setting capital requirements - while another oversaw adherence to business rules . 
But twin peaks itself was further subdivided . 
The Dutch model brigaded the prudential regulators inside the central bank , while the Australian version was built on a separate institution . 
These integrated structures seemed to offer many advantages . 
There were economies of scale and scope , and financial firms typically like the idea of a one-stop ( or , at worst , a two-stop ) shop . 
A single regulator might also be expected to develop a more coherent view of trends in the financial sector as a whole . 
Unfortunately , these benefits did not materialize , or at least not everywhere . 
It is hard to argue that the British system performed any more effectively than the American , so the single-regulator movement has suffered reputational damage . 
And the continuing travails of the Dutch banking system - another bank was nationalized last month - suggest that it is easy to fall into the gap between twin peaks . 
The truth is that it is hard to identify any correlation between regulatory structure and success in heading off or responding to the financial crisis . 
Among the single-regulator countries , Singapore and the Scandinavians were successful in dodging most of the fatal bullets , while the UK evidently was not . 
Among the twin peak exponents , the Dutch system performed very poorly indeed , while Australian financial regulation may be considered a success . 
Does it matter whether the central bank is directly involved ? 
Many central bankers maintain that the central bank is uniquely placed to deal with systemic risks , and that it is essential to carry out monetary and financial policies in the same institution . 
Again , it is hard to find strong empirical support for that argument . 
The Dutch and American central banks , with direct oversight of their banking systems , were no more effective in identifying potentially dangerous systemic issues than were non-central bank regulators elsewhere . 
Canada is often cited as a country that steered its banks away from trouble , even though they sit uncomfortably close to US markets . 
But the Bank of Canada is not now , and has never been , a hands-on institutional supervisor . 
So perhaps the US Congress has been right to conclude that changing the structure of regulatory bodies is less important than getting the content of regulation right . 
Elsewhere , though , a lot of structural change is under way . 
In the UK , every financial disturbance leads to calls to revamp the system . 
There were major overhauls in 1986 , and again in 1997 , when the Bank of England lost its banking supervision responsibilities as a delayed response to the collapse of Barings . 
Next month , it gets them back - and more . 
For the first time , the Bank of England will supervise insurance companies as well . 
A similar change has been introduced in France , where a new Prudential Control Authority has been created . 
The British and French rarely agree on anything ; one is tempted to say that when they do , they are highly likely to be wrong . 
It is difficult now to discern a coherent pattern . 
Certainly , the trend toward full-service single regulators outside the central bank has slowed to a crawl ( though Indonesia is consolidating regulators at present ) . 
There is no consensus on the role of the central bank : in around a third of countries , it is the dominant player , in another third it has responsibilities for banks only , while in the remaining third it is a system overseer only . 
We could see this as a controlled experiment to try to identify a preferred model . 
After all , financial systems are not so different from one another , particularly in OECD countries . 
But there is no sign of a considered assessment being prepared , which might at least help countries to make better-informed choices , even if it did not conclude that one model was unambiguously best . 
The G-20 , under its current Russian presidency , is now in search of a role . 
Here is a useful practical task it might take on .
