A Rio Report Card 
NEW YORK - One of the world &apos;s pre-eminent scientific publications , Nature , has just issued a scathing report card in advance of next week &apos;s Rio + 20 summit on sustainable development . 
The grades for implementation of the three great treaties signed at the first Rio Earth Summit in 1992 were as follows : Climate Change - F ; 
Biological Diversity - F ; and Combating Desertification - F. Can humanity still avoid getting itself expelled ? 
We have known for at least a generation that the world needs a course correction . 
Instead of powering the world economy with fossil fuels , we need to mobilize much greater use of low-carbon alternatives such as wind , solar , and geothermal power . 
Instead of hunting , fishing , and clearing land without regard for the impact on other species , we need to pace our agricultural production , fishing , and logging in line with the environment &apos;s carrying capacity . 
Instead of leaving the world &apos;s most vulnerable people without access to family planning , education , and basic health care , we need to end extreme poverty and reduce the soaring fertility rates that persist in the poorest parts of the world . 
In short , we need to recognize that with seven billion people today , and nine billion by mid-century , all inter-connected in a high-tech , energy-intensive global economy , our collective capacity to destroy the planet &apos;s life-support systems is unprecedented . 
Yet the consequences of our individual actions are typically so far removed from our daily awareness that we can go right over the cliff without even knowing it . 
When we power our computers and lights , we are unaware of the carbon emissions that result . 
When we eat our meals , we are unaware of the deforestation that has resulted from unsustainable farming . 
And when billions of our actions combine to create famines and floods halfway around the world , afflicting the poorest people in drought-prone Mali and Kenya , few of us are even dimly aware of the dangerous snares of global interconnectedness . 
Twenty years ago , the world tried to address these realities through treaties and international law . 
The agreements that emerged in 1992 at the first Rio summit were good ones : thoughtful , far-sighted , public-spirited , and focused on global priorities . 
Yet they have not saved us . 
Those treaties lived in the shadow of our daily politics , imaginations , and media cycles . 
Diplomats trudged off to conferences year after year to implement them , but the main results were neglect , delay , and bickering over legalities . 
Twenty years on , we have only three failing grades to show for our efforts . 
Is there a different way ? 
The path through international law engages lawyers and diplomats , but not the engineers , scientists , and community leaders on the front lines of sustainable development . 
It is littered with technical arcana about monitoring , binding obligations , annex-I and non-annex-I countries , and thousands of other legalisms , but has failed to give humanity the language to discuss our own survival . 
We have thousands of documents but a failure to speak plainly to one other . 
Do we want to save ourselves and our children ? 
Why didn &apos;t we say so ? 
At Rio + 20 we will have to say so , clearly , decisively , and in a way that leads to problem-solving and action , not to bickering and defensiveness . 
Since politicians follow public opinion rather than lead it , it must be the public itself that demands its own survival , not elected officials who are somehow supposed to save us despite ourselves . 
There are few heroes in politics ; waiting for the politicians would be to wait too long . 
The most important outcome in Rio , therefore , will not be a new treaty , binding clause , or political commitment . 
It will be a global call to action . 
Around the world , the cry is rising to put sustainable development at the center of global thinking and action , especially to help young people to solve the triple-bottom-line challenge - economic well-being , environmental sustainability , and social inclusion - that will define their era . Rio + 20 can help them to do it . 
Rather than a new treaty , let us adopt at Rio + 20 a set of Sustainable Development Goals , or SDGs , that will inspire a generation to act . 
Just as the Millennium Development Goals opened our eyes to extreme poverty and promoted unprecedented global action to fight AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria , the SDGs can open the eyes of today &apos;s youth to climate change , biodiversity loss , and the disasters of desertification . 
We can still make good on the three Rio treaties , by putting people at the forefront of the effort . 
SDGs to end extreme poverty ; decarbonize the energy system ; slow population growth ; promote sustainable food supplies ; protect the oceans , forests , and drylands ; and redress the inequalities of our time can galvanize a generation &apos;s worth of problem-solving . 
Engineers and technology wizards from Silicon Valley to SÃ£o Paolo to Bangalore to Shanghai have world-saving ideas up their sleeves . 
Universities around the world are home to legions of students and faculty intent on solving practical problems in their communities and countries . 
Businesses , at least the good ones , know that they can &apos;t flourish and motivate their workers and consumers unless they are part of the solution . 
The world is poised to act . 
Rio + 20 can help to unleash a generation of action . 
There is still time , just barely , to turn the F &apos;s to A &apos;s , and to pass humanity &apos;s ultimate test .
