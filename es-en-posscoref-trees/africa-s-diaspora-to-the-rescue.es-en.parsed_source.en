Africa &apos;s Diaspora to the Rescue 
DAKAR - There is something dismally familiar about the tide of news reports concerning Africa &apos;s increased suffering - more poverty , malnutrition , civil strife , and death - in the face of the recent global financial crisis . 
Almost everywhere , the media translates academic conclusions into graphic illustrations of brutality and despair in places such as Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo . 
But there is another , woefully under-reported , side to the story . 
African countries that were locked out of international capital markets for most of the past five decades have largely been spared the twin woes of financial turmoil and economic downturn . 
The continent &apos;s economies experienced a slowdown , but not a recession . 
Indeed , according to McKinsey 
Company , Africa was the third-largest contributor to world economic growth in 2009 , after China and India . 
Moreover , several African countries have received ratings from credit agencies , which has opened up global financial centers to them . 
In some cases , these ratings have proved equivalent to or higher than those of countries such as Turkey or Argentina . 
Stock exchanges are being established across the continent . 
Furthermore , countries such as China , India , and Brazil has provided a platform for increased exports and the inception of a model of cooperation based on trade , investment , and technology transfer , rather than &quot; aid . &quot; 
China-Africa trade alone increased from $ 10 billion in 2000 to $ 107 billion in 2008 , and billions of dollars are being invested in oil production , mining , transportation , electricity generation and transmission , telecommunications , and other infrastructure . 
These developments have combined to improve African countries &quot; macroeconomic performance dramatically . 
Inflation has been halved since the 1990 &quot; s , and foreign-exchange reserves have increased 30 % . 
Public finances showed a 2.8 % -of-GDP surplus in 2008 , compared to a 1.4 % -of-GDP deficit in 2000-2005 . 
Savings rates are between 10 % and 20 % , and external debt has decreased from 110 % of GDP in 2005 to 21 % in 2008 . 
Since 2000 , sub-Saharan African countries have achieved economic growth of 5-7 % . 
Many factors have contributed to this upturn . 
Emerging-market demand has pushed up commodity prices . 
Urbanization has given rise to a dynamic informal sector . 
Improved governance , higher food production , increased inter-regional trade , debt cancellation , better use of official development assistance ( ODA ) , and thriving telecommunications and housing markets have helped as well . 
But transfers from the African diaspora stand out as the most significant contributing factor . 
A study commissioned by the Rome-based International Fund for Agricultural Development indicates that more than 30 million individuals living outside their countries of origin contribute more than $ 40 billion annually in remittances to their families and communities back home . 
For sub-Saharan African countries , remittances increased from $ 3.1 billion in 1995 to $ 18.5 billion in 2007 , according to the World Bank , representing between 9 % and 24 % of GDP and 80-750 % of ODA . 
Migrants &quot; remittance behavior is essentially dictated by the regulatory environment and the quality - in terms of speed , cost , security , and accessibility - of products and services offered by banks , money-transfer companies , micro-finance institutions , and informal operators . 
In this respect , there are three different strategies in place in Africa . 
The Anglophone strategy focuses on freeing up the remittance market by encouraging competition , relaxing regulatory constraints for non-bank operators , offering financial incentives , encouraging technical and financial innovation , and stimulating collaboration among market players . 
This approach , also adopted by Italy , contributes to reducing costs and increasing the overall volume of funds for beneficiaries . 
The Hispanic approach emphasizes migrants &quot; involvement in banking by offering a range of banking services in both the country of origin and the host country , products of specific interest to migrants , and low commissions on foreign transfers . 
This approach , widely developed by Morocco and the Portuguese-speaking world , is epitomized by the zero-commission policy initiated by the Spanish bank Santander and its Moroccan counterpart , Attijariwafa Bank . 
Finally , the Francophone approach relies on two types of monopoly . 
The first is enjoyed by Western Union , which controls up to 90 % of the total formal transfer volume within Africa &apos;s 16-member Franc Zone . 
Western Union charges fees as high as 25 % on transfers to these countries , compared to an average global benchmark of 5 % , and has required that Franc-Zone countries sign exclusivity agreements , thereby preventing foreign-exchange bureaux , post offices , and micro-finance institutions from carrying out money transfers . 
The second monopoly is exercised in the banking sector . 
France has a veto within the boards of directors of the Franc Zone &apos;s two central banks , while two French commercial banks , BNP-Paribas and Société Générale , exercise a quasi-monopoly on lending programs , mainly centered on short-term trade financing and the needs of governments , public and private companies , and the elite . 
All other local banks have adopted the same approach , severely restricting access to financial services for households and entrepreneurs . 
Despite the increasing importance of remittances from Italy , Spain , and the United States , the largest share in absolute terms still originates from France . 
There is thus a real need in the Franc Zone for a financing institution that would convert migrant remittances into productive investments , thereby generating jobs and wealth , and that would broaden access to banking services , mortgages , insurance products , pension plans , and technical assistance . 
Official statistics for 2009 are likely to show that migrants &quot; remittances fell sharply , as the global recession severely eroded job opportunities abroad .
