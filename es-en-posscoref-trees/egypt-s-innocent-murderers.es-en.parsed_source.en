Egypt &apos;s Innocent Murderers 
CAIRO - &quot; Bashar should abandon power and retire safely in Egypt . 
The general-prosecutor is murder-friendly , &quot; a friend , referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , told me as we watched former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s trial in the Police Academy &apos;s criminal court . 
Although Mubarak and his interior ( security ) minister , Habib al-Adly , were handed life sentences at the conclusion of their trials , the generals who ran Egypt &apos;s apparatus of repression as deputy interior ministers were acquitted . 
Hasan Abd al-Rahman , head of the notorious , Stasi-like State Security Investigations ( SSI ) ; 
Ahmad Ramzi , head of the Central Security Forces ( CSF ) ; 
Adly Fayyid , the head of Public Security ; 
Ismail al-Shaer , who led the Cairo Security Directorate ( CSD ) ; 
Osama Youssef , the head of the Giza Security Directorate ; and Omar Faramawy , who oversaw of the 6th of October Security Directorate , were all cleared of any wrongdoing . 
Lawyers for Mubarak and al-Adly will appeal their life-sentences , and many Egyptians believe that they will receive lighter sentences . 
The verdicts sent an unmistakable message , one with serious consequences for Egypt &apos;s political transition . 
A spontaneous cry was heard from the lawyers and the families of victims when they were announced : &quot; The people want to cleanse the judiciary . &quot; 
Indeed , many Egyptians - including senior judges - do not view the judiciary as an independent institution . 
&quot; This is a major professional mistake . 
Those generals should have been handed life-sentences like Mubarak , &quot; said Zakaria Abd al-Aziz , the former elected head of the Judges Club . 
&quot; The killing went on for days , and they did not order anyone to stop it . 
The Ministry of Interior ( MOI ) is not the only place that should be cleansed . 
The judiciary needs that &quot; as well . 
The verdicts certainly reinforce a culture of impunity within the security services . 
The SSI and its departments were responsible for many human-rights violations , including mass-torture and extra-judicial killings , throughout Mubarak &apos;s 30-year rule . 
When protestors stormed the SSI headquarters and other governorates in March 2011 , torture rooms and equipment were found in every building . 
Unlawful detentions , kidnappings , disappearances , systematic torture , rape , and inhuman prison conditions have all been documented since the 1980 &quot; s by human-rights organizations and a few Egyptian courts . 
Acquitting the heads of the SSI and the CSF ( the 300,000-strong institution that acted as the &quot; muscle &quot; of Mubarak &apos;s regime ) , after a revolution sparked by police brutality , led directly to renewed protests in Tahrir Square . 
&quot; We either get the rights of the martyrs , or die like them , &quot; chanted hundreds of thousands in Tahrir and other Egyptian squares . 
Sit-ins , reminiscent of the 18 days of January and February 2011 that ended Mubarak &apos;s rule , have already started . 
A third consequence of the verdicts concerns the empowerment of an anti-reform faction within the MOI . 
Based on my year-long research on Egyptian security-sector reform , this faction is already the most powerful . 
Following the revolution , factional struggle within the MOI became public . 
&quot; We have to save face , &quot; said General Abd al-Latif Badiny , a deputy interior minister who was fired under al-Adly . 
&quot; &#91; M &#93; any officers and commanders refused to torture detainees and were against corruption , but we need a revolutionary president to empower us and clean the ministry . &quot; 
Badiny was reappointed after the revolution , but then reprimanded in November 2011 , following clashes between demonstrators and police that left more than 40 protesters dead . 
&quot; He was advocating dialogue with protesters , whereas al-Adly &apos;s men wanted a harsh crackdown . 
They got their way in the end , &quot; says Major Ahmad Ragab , the spokesperson of the reformist General Coalition of Police Officers ( GCPO ) , which seeks to establish an official police syndicate and reform the security services along apolitical , professional lines . 
The verdicts will significantly affect two other processes : revolutionary forces &quot; capacity to mobilize , and thus to place pressure on the ruling Supreme Council of Armed Forces ( SCAF ) , and the presidential elections . 
The objectives of those protesting the verdicts in Tahrir and other squares include : a judicial purge ; a law that would ban Mubarak &apos;s senior officials from holding political posts for ten years ; new trials for al-Aldy &apos;s generals ; and removal of the general prosecutor ( who was appointed by Mubarak ) . 
There are also calls , still undeveloped , for greater unity ahead of the presidential run-off election on June 16-17 . 
Such appeals range from demanding an immediate transfer of power to a coalition of revolutionary presidential candidates ( although the mechanism is vague ) to the formation of a united presidential front in the runoff , with Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brothers ( MB ) as President and left-leaning Nasserist Hamadin Sabahi and liberal-leaning moderate-Islamist Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh as Vice-Presidents . 
MPs have already called on the three figures to come to the parliament and negotiate a coalition . 
The verdicts are likely to boost support in the runoff for Morsi , who split the Islamist vote with two other candidates in the election &apos;s first round . 
Moreover , a significant share of the non-Islamist revolutionary vote will go to Morsi , owing to the absence of other revolutionary alternatives . 
The common saying in Tahrir is : &quot; We &apos;ve got differences with Morsi , but we &apos;ve got blood with &#91; Ahmed &#93; Shafiq , &quot; Mubarak &apos;s last prime minister and Morsi &apos;s opponent in the runoff . 
Pro-revolution , non-Islamist , and non-MB candidates received almost 9.7 million votes in the first round of the presidential election . 
The majority of these voters will probably now support Morsi , as opposed to staying home ( the general drift before the verdicts ) . 
The MB must still decide for inclusiveness if it wants to attract the support of Aboul Fotouh and Sabahi voters in the runoff against Shafiq . 
The key challenge for Egyptian revolutionaries is to sustain that unity , establish a leadership coalition , translate their chants into concrete demands , and maintain the pressure during implementation . 
Egypt &apos;s revolution continues .
