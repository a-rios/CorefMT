The Soft Underbelly of Europe \ u0027s \ 
France and Germany used to see themselves as the European Union &apos;s &quot; hard core , &quot; surrounded by concentric circles of less committed partners . 
Only the other four founding members of what was the European Community - Italy , Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg - were admitted into the innermost circle of Europe &apos;s true believers . 
No doubt , the post-WWII reconciliation between France and Germany - who once perceived and fought each other as &quot; hereditary enemies &quot;  - has been the motor of European integration for half a century . 
Today , however , that Franco-German couple looks more like Europe &apos;s soft underbelly . 
The motor has turned into a brake . 
The traumatic experience of western disunity over Iraq in the UN Security Council - with the governments of Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder leading the resistance to the US / UK led invasion of Iraq - demonstrated that Franco-German bilateralism has destructive side effects . 
Their perceived claim to speak for Europe antagonized much of the Union . 
A European &quot; hard core &quot; is not an end in itself . 
Its raison d &apos;être is to overcome national selfishness and to set a good example . 
If guided by the spirit of multilateralism , the Franco-German pair pulls Europe together . 
But this is precisely what France and Germany now refrain from doing in many fields of European integration . 
In October last year , Chirac and Schröder struck a deal on the EU &apos;s Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) , ensuring that France will remain the biggest beneficiary of the farm budget after the EU takes in 10 new members in 2004 . 
The CAP consumes about half of the Union &apos;s budget - an unimpressive symbol for a community that aims to become a player in world politics . 
Now , the agreement underpinning Europe &apos;s single currency , the euro , has come under Franco-German attack . 
Once again , the two countries have forged a &quot; coalition of the unwilling &quot;  - this time against the sanctions mechanism of the European Stability and Growth Pact , which limits the size of euro members &apos; budget deficits to 3 % of GDP . 
The European Central Bank has indicated that the Pact &apos;s collapse could force up Euroland interest rates . 
In other words , countries complying with the Pact would now pay the bill for the lack of fiscal discipline in France and Germany . 
Germany &apos;s behavior is particularly galling , as it had been the strongest advocate of the Stability Pact . 
Under Chancellor Helmut Kohl , it gave up its beloved Deutsche Mark for the sake of deepening European integration , but also to sooth French fears that Germany was poised to establish monetary hegemony over the continent . 
France , in turn , had to swallow the Stability and Growth Pact to convince a reluctant German public that the euro would be as stable as the Deutsche Mark . 
Abiding by European rules should go without saying , even if that means adopting unpopular austerity measures at home . 
It is understandable that good Europeans like the Dutch and the Finns find it unacceptable that heavyweights like France and Germany now claim to be more equal than smaller countries . 
If the EU becomes used to that idea - beyond fair institutional arrangements that take into account demographic differences - the process of European unification will lose its legitimacy . 
What is at stake for Germany is not simply its reputation as a source of economic dynamism and an anchor of monetary stability within the EU . 
It may also be destroying the main pillar of its influence in international politics more broadly - that is , its ability to act as an &quot; honest broker , &quot; to use Bismarck &apos;s famous phrase . 
The postwar architecture of German foreign policy has been made up of several bridges - to the United States , to France , to Britain , to smaller EU member states , to Central and Eastern Europe , and to Russia . 
The German way of diplomacy consisted of avoiding hard choices between Paris and Washington , Moscow and Warsaw , the EU and NATO , big neighbors and small ones . 
If a choice had to be made , Germany gave America priority over France . 
Gaullism , or the vision of a French-led European counterweight to the US , has never been an option for Germany . 
Neither , to be sure , has the Euro-skeptic British version of Atlanticism . 
For all German Chancellors from Konrad Adenauer to Helmut Kohl , France was the favorite European partner , but they refused to accept French offers to create a &quot; Franco-German union &quot; that would destroy the mediating character of German foreign policy . 
Tragically , the bridges to the US as well as to Central and Eastern Europe have been damaged by German diplomacy during the Iraq crisis , and the bridge to the smaller EU member states is now in the process of being damaged by the Teutonic colossus &apos;s noncompliance with the Stability and Growth Pact . 
As for the euro , the Germans have to accept that if they want to remain good Europeans , they have to get their own fiscal house in order . 
For whatever they do or refrain from doing in terms of domestic reforms affects their partners . 
As for the future of Europe &apos;s &quot; hard core , &quot; such an idea only makes sense from a German perspective if it does not limit Germany &apos;s role as a moderator . 
The best solution for Europe would be an inner circle consisting of France , Germany , and Britain , at least . 
Together , these three countries represent the complete diversity of foreign policy traditions that one can find in the future 25-member EU . 
Trying to pool these traditions may look like trying to square a circle . 
But the alternative is a European Disunion that no one will take seriously as a player in world politics . 
That is an outcome that no true European believer in France and Germany should be prepared to countenance .
