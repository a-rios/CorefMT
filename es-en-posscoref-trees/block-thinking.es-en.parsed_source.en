Block Thinking 
&quot; Multiculturalism &quot; has become a suspect term almost everywhere in the world nowadays , and particularly in Europe . 
People say things like : &quot; I used to be for openness and toleration of difference , but now I see where it &apos;s leading . &quot; 
But where is it leading ? 
Almost every reason for toleration &apos;s apparent fall into disrepute concerns Islam . 
Even simple requests , like that of schoolgirls to wear headscarves in class , are suddenly freighted with immense political significance and treated as issues that must be resolved at the highest level of government . 
People - and their elected leaders as well  -  often have the feeling that such seemingly innocent proposals are in fact part of an ominous &quot; hidden agenda . &quot; 
That agenda is &quot; Islam , &quot; which many imagine to include all the terrible things that we can read about in the press every day : the stoning of adulterous women under Sharia law in northern Nigeria , the amputation of thieves &quot; hands in Saudi Arabia , honor killings of women who refuse arranged marriages in Pakistan ( or even northern English cities like Bradford and Manchester ) , the willingness to justify suicide bombings . 
If you reply that the girls who want to wear headscarves to school aren &apos;t living in Nigeria or Saudi Arabia , and almost certainly don &apos;t share the extreme Wahhabi views found in those countries , you will be met with a look of almost indulgent pity , a look of the type reserved for the terminally na√Øve . 
Or you will be told stories about how Saudi trained imams are twisting the girls &quot; arms , turning them into unwilling stalking-horses for &quot; Islam . &quot; 
Indeed , it is virtually impossible nowadays to talk about headscarves as an issue in its own right . 
All the sociological evidence about the girls &quot; motives , which are in fact very varied , is swept aside as irrelevant . 
All that matters is the threat posed by Islam . 
This is a classic example of what I call &quot; block thinking , &quot; which seems to have made huge strides in Europe in recent years . 
John Bowen &apos;s recent book Why the French Don &apos;t Like Headscarves documents this shift . 
Block thinking fuses a varied reality into one indissoluble unity , and in two ways . 
First , different manifestations of Islamic piety or culture are seen as alternative ways of expressing the same core meaning . 
Second , all Muslims are then seen as endorsing these core meanings . 
The possibility that a girl wearing a headscarf might in fact be rebelling against her parents and their kind of Islam , and that others might be deeply pious while being utterly revolted by gender discrimination or violence , is lost from view . 
Block thinking is an age-old phenomenon , and we all do it to some degree . 
But , while in another age we might have been indulgent about its consequences , today it has explosive potential , because people who think in this manner are prime recruits for seeing the world in terms of Samuel Huntington &apos;s theory of the &quot; clash of civilizations . &quot; 
What &apos;s worse , the way such people then act tends to edge us closer to Huntington &apos;s nightmare scenario . 
By treating all the varied segments of Islam as nothing more than parts of a unified threat to the West , they make it harder for Muslims to stand out and criticize their own block thinkers - people like Osama bin Laden , who are building their own unified enemy , composed of &quot; Christians and Jews . &quot; 
Block thinkers on each side give aid and comfort to block thinkers on the other side , and with each exchange they pull us closer toward an abyss . 
So how can we stop this madness ? 
Block thought persists in part because its critics on each side are unknown to those on the other side . 
Indeed , how many times does a critic of European block thought meet this kind of response : &quot; But where are the Muslims who are criticizing extremist Islam ? &quot; 
Of course , one isn &apos;t likely to meet them in the drawing rooms of Paris journalists or the wider European professional political class . 
But explaining that to block thinkers will never have the impact of a real connection to the multi-faceted discourse that is actually taking place on the other side . 
The real question , then , is this : Where are the crossover figures who can provide that urgently needed connection ?
