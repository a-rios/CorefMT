Who Needs the Social Sciences ? 
Why are the social sciences so much more at risk of having their budgets cut than the other two great bodies of academic knowledge , the humanities and the natural sciences ? 
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher notoriously proposed that the field simply does not exist : there is no such thing as society , she claimed . 
Others point to the restructuring of university social science departments . 
But the expansion of business schools arguably testifies to the continued vitality of the social sciences . 
Nor is it true that the social sciences belabor the obvious , as is sometimes said . 
On the contrary , today &apos;s commonplaces were yesterday &apos;s innovations . 
If you compare the concepts used to frame newspaper editorials today and ten or more years ago , you will find the deep - but unacknowledged - impact of the social sciences . 
The influence may be regretted , but at least it is registered . 
Still , where are the social sciences in the vast conversation over &quot; human nature &quot; that has been prompted by recent advances in cognitive neuroscience , behavioral genetics , and evolutionary psychology ? 
Check out the elaborate and informative website ( www.edge.org ) devoted to the promotion of a &quot; third culture &quot; that bridges the humanities and the natural sciences . 
Social scientists are conspicuous by their absence . 
But what difference would their presence make ? 
It is often assumed that everyone recoils at the prospect that there are genetic limits to our capacity for change . 
Actually , only those imbued with the optimistic spirit of social science recoil . 
Everyone else is relieved . 
In the &quot; third culture &quot; best seller The Blank Slate : The Modern Denial of Human Nature , Steven Pinker says that we may need to admit a natural scientific basis for what humanists have for centuries called &quot; fate . &quot; 
In other words , the configuration of our brains and genes may ultimately be out of our control , however deeply we come to understand them . 
Pinker &apos;s message will appeal to those eager to avoid political reforms that would compel a greater sense of collective responsibility . 
After all , the social sciences historically offered empirical support and spiritual hope for just such reforms , which are increasingly dismissed as &quot; utopian . &quot; 
By contrast , the humanities and the natural sciences share a sense of reality that transcends time and place ; hence their common interest in a fixed &quot; human nature . &quot; 
This is tied to a way of thinking and a sense of knowing that is largely contemplative and sometimes even disempowering , as reality comes to seem to be whatever resists our concerted efforts at change . 
These two great academic cultures also prefer to study humanity without having to mingle with flesh-and-blood human beings . 
Thus , evolutionary psychologists infer what makes us who we are from the remains of our Stone Age ancestors ( including their DNA ) , whereas humanists focus on artifacts of a more recent and literate age . 
In contrast , the social sciences adhere to the maxim that the best way to study humans is to interact with them , typically by getting them to do and say things that they might otherwise not . 
This profoundly simple idea , common to experiments and ethnographies , inspired the triumphs and disasters that punctuate modern politics . 
It requires an increasingly controversial assumption : all human beings - whatever their achievements , competences , status , or health - are equally significant members of society , whose strength ultimately lies in what they can do together . 
The social sciences &apos; egalitarianism runs counter to both the humanist fixation on elite &quot; classic &quot; texts and the natural scientific tendency to generalize across species . 
Thus , social scientists made the everyday lives of ordinary people respectable , while refusing to privilege certain animals over certain - typically disabled or unwanted - humans . 
&quot; Welfare &quot; occupies a pride of place in the social sciences that humanists and natural scientists replace with &quot; survival &quot; and maybe even &quot; fortune . &quot; 
To be sure , the checkered history of welfare in the 20 th century put the future of the social sciences in doubt . 
But a way forward can be found in T. H. Huxley , Darwin &apos;s fabled public defender . 
A late convert to evolution , he was a lifelong skeptic about the theory &apos;s political implications . 
For Huxley , civilized society rose above nature by its systematic resistance to natural selection . 
In his words , the human condition is not about &quot; survival of the fittest &quot; but &quot; the fitting of as many as can survive . &quot; 
Huxley identified humanity &apos;s achievements with legal conventions and medical technologies , artifices that extend human dominion by enabling people to be and do more than they could individually . 
The future of the social sciences may lie in rekindling this coalition of law and medicine and upgrading the artificial in a world that may have come to overvalue nature .
