The Third Way is A Rightwing Way 
CHICAGO : &quot; Only de Gaulle could free Algeria ; only Nixon could open up China . &quot; 
Behind these slogans rests an notable principle : self-interest often causes political parties to radically depart from , even to abandon , their traditional ideologies . 
This insight is particularly useful in Europe , and increasingly around the globe , when examining the actions of supposedly leftwing and socialist governments . 
In the late 1950s France came near to civil war over Algeria . 
Out of power since 1946 , Charles de Gaulle was summoned back to the Elys√©e to lead France out of this quagmire . 
Because of his patriotism , de Gaulle seemed the only man able to set Algeria free . 
Starting in the late 1960 &quot; s rapprochement between Mao &apos;s China and America became possible because China was involved in political and military conflicts with the Soviet Union . 
America &apos;s Democrats knew this as well as the Republicans , but President Johnson was afraid to approach China because his party was supposedly soft on communism . 
Only a dedicated anti-Communist like Nixon had sufficient political support from the right to visit China and urge cooperation between the US and China against their common enemy in the Kremlin . 
Economics is not immune from this dynamic . 
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher successfully promoted lower income taxes , privatization of government enterprises , weaker unions , and a generally smaller role for government . 
The popularity and success of their programs induced liberal , labor , and social democratic governments in many nations to also promote free market policies in direct conflict with their traditional ideologies . 
Often , only these parties have sufficient political support on the left to succeed in introducing needed reforms in labor and other markets . 
Market reforms initiated by the left started in 1984 with a New Zealand labor government which enacted legislation that transformed a small formerly isolated nation into one of the most &quot; liberal &quot; economies in the world . 
New Zealand &apos;s Laborites privatized the postal system and many other public enterprises , and changed the country &apos;s employment system from highly centralized collective bargaining to one that gave employers considerable discretion to hire and fire and to pay market-determined wages . 
The Democratic Party of the US has in the past strongly supported big government , but under President Bill Clinton it took heed of the popularity of the Republican Party &apos;s stance advocating less paternalism and smaller government . 
It was President Clinton , not Bush or Reagan , who declared that &quot; the era of big government was over &quot; as his administration radically reversed traditional Democratic positions on welfare , balanced budgets , public debt reduction , and the encouragement of business . 
A telling example of this trend is found in Mexico &apos;s economic policies of the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
The Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) that governed Mexico uninterrupted for seven decades ( until its recent loss of the presidency to Vincente Fox ) had been a strong advocate of government ownership of heavy industry , prohibitive duties on imports to protect domestic companies , and detailed regulation of labor and financial markets . 
Starting with President Miguel de la Madrid in the early 1980 &quot; s , however , the PRI responded to free market critics of Mexico &apos;s weak economic performance by selling many government-owned enterprises , partially privatizing the Mexican social security system , and becoming a strong advocate of a free trade agreement with its large &quot; enemy &quot; to the north , the US . 
So President Fox needs only to continue this revolution , not start his own . 
Argentina &apos;s Senate recently reacted to very high unemployment by passing a labor market reform bill that cuts union power and gives employers flexibility in hiring and firing . 
This reform is being promoted by the new center-left government of Fernando de la Rua after the failure of attempts to reform the labor market by the previous conservative government of Carlos Menem . 
But it is recent policy changes in Germany and France that provide , perhaps , the most impressive examples of the &quot; de Gaulle / Algeria &quot; and &quot; Nixon / China &quot; theory of political reform . 
Both nations suffered high unemployment and slow growth during the 1990 &quot; s , in good measure due to heavy-handed regulation of labor and other markets . 
Conservative governments in these nations accomplished little in the way of serious market reform , despite considerable rhetoric . 
The Jospin and Schroeder governments were elected on manifestos that promised to cut unemployment and raise growth by expanding government regulation . 
Each regime did in fact start out by introducing more government controls - including a law to implement a 35 hour week in France . 
Both governments , however , soon  -  and quite stealthily  -  reversed course . 
Gerhard Schroeder in Germany has now slashed corporate taxes , is encouraging startup companies , and promises to provide tax breaks for private pension plans . 
French Premier Jospin quietly liberalized the French labor market by allowing for more part-time work , increased privatization , and promoted a more globally competitive financial system with reduced governmental control . 
If Nixon could seek agreement with Communist China , and de Gaulle surrender Algeria , it is a relatively small step for Socialists to embrace the free market and support much lower taxes on business . 
In politics as in life , ideology is usually overwhelmed by self-interest .
