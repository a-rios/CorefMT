Syria &apos;s No-Solution Solution 
MADRID - Syria is a blood-soaked shambles . 
Four years of civil war have left more than 200,000 dead , one million wounded , and 6.7 million people internally displaced . 
Another 3.8 million are living as refugees outside the country , and 13 million ( out of a pre-war population of 20 million ) are in need of humanitarian assistance . 
Two illustrious United Nations special envoys - Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi - have resigned in the face of Syria &apos;s self-perpetuating spiral of violence . 
But , against this bleak background , there is reason for cautious optimism . 
Kurdish forces recently succeeded , after months of heavy fighting , in expelling the Islamic State from the border town of Kobane . 
Moreover , the new UN envoy , Staffan de Mistura , has initiated a pragmatic and determined &quot; Aleppo first &quot; strategy , which aims to freeze military operations in the shattered city and facilitate the entry of aid . 
Could this mark a turning point for Syria ? 
When the crisis in Syria erupted , nobody predicted how serious , protracted , and complex it would turn out to be . 
For starters , observers underestimated citizens &apos; ever-deepening sense of hopelessness , which has driven them to support jihadi groups or the Assad regime . 
The conflict is also unique in its asymmetry , stemming from the numerous and disparate actors involved . 
There are only two conventional armies : the Kurdish fighters and the forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad . 
The opposition comprises factions dependent on foreign sponsors . 
Indeed , the &quot; nationalist &quot; opposition is merely an assortment of factions responsible for protecting small territories , and the &quot; Free Syrian Army &quot; is little more than a fantasy . The stark reality is that the best-organized groups are the jihadists : the Islamic State , Jabhat al-Nusra , and the Islamic Front . 
De Mistura &apos;s plan aims to stabilize the situation by shifting the policy focus away from a relentless military campaign - an approach that is benefiting only the Islamic State . 
The plan &apos;s emphasis on Aleppo - which is not only a commercial hub and Syria &apos;s largest city , but also represents a sort of microcosm of the country - distinguishes it from the shaky cease-fires that have been implemented in Homs and elsewhere in the country . 
The strategy &apos;s main strength is that it is not , in itself , a peace project . 
Instead of requiring that any or all factions surrender or relinquish their weapons , it calls only for the cessation of heavy fighting , to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid and prevent Aleppo &apos;s total collapse . 
Such a freeze - guaranteed by an effective enforcement mechanism - would present an important opportunity to make progress in confidence-building . 
Recent talks in Cairo and Moscow produced small , but not negligible , steps in that direction . 
The objective should be to initiate a productive dialogue - and , ultimately , achieve consensus - among relevant actors . 
In this proxy war , no solution will be possible without the agreement of the factions &apos; main sources of support - Iran , Saudi Arabia , and Qatar . 
Likewise , Turkey must not only address the inflow of refugees , security concerns along its border with Syria , and its position as a transit country for jihadists ; it must also develop a coherent policy toward the Islamic State that is not subsumed in official anxiety over demands by the country &apos;s Kurdish minority . 
Other powers will also have a key role to play . 
Support by the United States for de Mistura &apos;s initiative symbolizes a quiet - and constructive - shift by President Barack Obama &apos;s administration from its demand that Assad step down immediately . 
The European Union &apos;s policy toward Syria , however , remains confused , with member states having managed to agree only to create a &quot; regional trust fund &quot; to address the crisis . 
Given the EU &apos;s strong interest in a more stable Syria , rooted in its geographical proximity , it is time for European leaders to take an unequivocal stance on Syria . 
But a lasting solution to the conflict ultimately comes down to the Syrians . 
In fact , the foundations for the kind of Syrian-led political solution that is needed were laid with the 2012 Geneva I Communiqu√© . 
At that time , successive rounds of negotiations failed , owing to an all-or-nothing mentality , based largely on the mistaken assumption that Assad , like Tunisia &apos;s Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and Egypt &apos;s Hosni Mubarak , would be ousted relatively quickly . 
But de Mistura has made it clear that he aims neither to build a lasting peace with Assad nor to establish Assad &apos;s departure from power as a precondition for peace . 
The solution lies between these two options , and the West - especially Europe - must accept that . 
Placing unrealistic demands on a Syrian peace process is a sure route to failure . 
The stability of the region and the lives ( and what is left of the livelihoods ) of the Syrian people depend on it .
