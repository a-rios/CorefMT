Europe at War 
NEW YORK - By invading Ukraine in 2014 , President Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia has posed a fundamental challenge to the values and principles on which the European Union was founded , and to the rules-based system that has kept the peace in Europe since 1945 . 
Neither Europe &apos;s leaders nor its citizens are fully aware of the scope of this challenge , much less how to deal with it . 
Putin &apos;s regime is based on rule by force , manifested in repression at home and aggression abroad . 
Violating its treaty obligations , Russia annexed Crimea and established separatist enclaves in eastern Ukraine &apos;s Donbas region . 
When it appeared last summer that the Ukrainian government might win the war in Donbas , Putin ordered an invasion by regular Russian armed forces . 
Preparations for a second wave of military action began in November , when Putin provided separatists with a new influx of armored columns and personnel . 
The West , sadly , has provided embattled Ukraine with only a façade of support . 
Equally disturbing has been the continuing reluctance of international leaders to provide new financial commitments to Ukraine , despite growing pressure on its foreign-currency reserves and the specter of a full-blown financial meltdown . 
As a result , the mere threat of military action may be sufficient to bring about Ukraine &apos;s economic collapse . 
Putin seems to be holding out the prospect of a grand bargain , with Russia helping in the fight against the Islamic State - for example , by not supplying S300 missiles to Syria ( thus preserving US air domination ) - in exchange for the US giving Russia control over its so-called &quot; near abroad . &quot; 
Should US President Barack Obama accept such a deal , the entire structure of international relations would be dangerously altered in favor of the use of force . 
That would be a tragic mistake , with far-reaching geopolitical consequences . 
The collapse of Ukraine would be a tremendous loss for NATO and indirectly for the EU and the US . 
Instead of supporting Ukraine , NATO would have to defend itself on its own soil , exposing both the EU and the US to the danger they have been so eager to avoid : direct military confrontation with Russia . 
The threat to the EU &apos;s political cohesion is even greater than the military risk . 
The euro crisis has transformed an ever-closer union of equal sovereign states , willingly sacrificing a share of their independence for the common good , into an association of creditor and debtor countries , with the debtors struggling to meet the creditors &quot; terms . 
This new EU is neither equal nor voluntary . 
In fact , for many young people in the debtor countries , the EU seems like a foreign oppressor . 
It is this internal weakness that has allowed Putin &apos;s Russia - which , on its own , is far from attractive - to emerge as a potent rival to the EU . 
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has gone so far as to cite Putin as his role model - and he is no anomaly . Neither Europe &apos;s leaders nor its citizens seem to recognize that Russia &apos;s attack on Ukraine is indirectly an assault on the EU and its principles of governance . 
It should be clear that it is inappropriate for a country , or association of countries , at war to pursue fiscal austerity , as the EU continues to do . 
All available resources should be put to work in the war effort , even if that requires running up budget deficits . 
Europe is fortunate that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has behaved as a true European with regard to the threat posed by Russia . 
The foremost advocate of sanctions , she has been more willing to defy German public opinion and business interests on the issue than on any other . 
But Germany has also been the main advocate of fiscal austerity , and Merkel needs to understand the contradiction between these positions . 
Sanctions against Russia are necessary , but they are not without repercussions . 
European economies , including Germany , are suffering , as the sanctions &quot; depressive impact aggravates the recessionary and deflationary forces that are already at work . 
By contrast , helping Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression would have a stimulative effect on Ukraine and Europe . 
The EU &apos;s members are at war - and they need to start acting like it . 
Ukraine needs an immediate cash injection of , say , $ 20 billion , with a promise of more when needed , in order to stave off a financial collapse . 
The International Monetary Fund could provide these funds , as it did previously , with the EU promising to match the IMF &apos;s contribution . 
Actual expenditures would remain under the IMF &apos;s control and subject to the implementation of far-reaching structural reforms . 
In Ukraine , there is one more factor working in the EU &apos;s favor : the country &apos;s new leadership is determined to correct previous governments &quot; corruption , mismanagement , and abuses . 
Indeed , it has already created a detailed strategy to cut household gas consumption by more than half , with the goal of dispersing the corrupt gas monopoly of Naftogaz and ending Ukraine &apos;s energy dependence on Russia . 
The &quot; new Ukraine &quot; is resolutely pro-European , and ready to defend Europe by defending itself . 
Supporting the new Ukraine in 2015 and beyond is the most cost-effective investment the EU could make . 
It could even help the EU recapture the spirit of unity and shared prosperity that led to its creation . 
In short , by saving Ukraine , the EU could also save itself .
