A Phantom Recovery ? 
NEW YORK - Where is the American and global economy headed ? 
Last year , there were two sides to the debate . 
One camp argued that the recession in the United States would be V-shaped - short and shallow . 
It would last only eight months , like the two previous recessions of 1990-1991 and 2001 , and the world would decouple from the US contraction . 
Others , including me , argued that , given the excesses of private-sector leverage ( in households , financial institutions , and corporate firms ) , this would be a U-shaped recession - long and deep . 
It would last about 24 months , and the world would not decouple from the US contraction . 
Today , 20 months into the US recession - a recession that became global in the summer of 2008 with a massive re-coupling - the V-shaped decoupling view is out the window . 
This is the worst US and global recession in 60 years . 
If the US recession were - as most likely - to be over at the end of the year , as is likely , it will have been three times as long and about fives times as deep - in term of the cumulative decline in output - as the previous two . 
Today &apos;s consensus among economists is that the recession is already over , that the US and global economy will rapidly return to growth , and that there is no risk of a relapse . 
Unfortunately , this new consensus could be as wrong now as the defenders of the V-shaped scenario were for the past three years . 
Data from the US - rising unemployment , falling household consumption , still declining industrial production , and a weak housing market - suggest that America &apos;s recession is not over yet . 
A similar analysis of many other advanced economies suggests that , as in the US , the bottom is quite close but it has not yet been reached . 
Most emerging economies may be returning to growth , but they are performing well below their potential . 
Moreover , for a number of reasons , growth in the advanced economies is likely to remain anemic and well below trend for at least a couple of years . 
The first reason is likely to create a long-term drag on growth : households need to deleverage and save more , which will constrain consumption for years . 
Second , the financial system - both banks and non-bank institutions - is severely damaged . 
Lack of robust credit growth will hamper private consumption and investment spending . 
Third , the corporate sector faces a glut of capacity , and a weak recovery of profitability is likely if growth is anemic and deflationary pressures still persist . 
As a result , businesses are not likely to increase capital spending . 
Fourth , the re-leveraging of the public sector through large fiscal deficits and debt accumulation risks crowding out a recovery in private-sector spending . 
The effects of the policy stimulus , moreover , will fizzle out by early next year , requiring greater private demand to support continued growth . 
Domestic private demand , especially consumption , is now weak or falling in over-spending countries ( the US , the United Kingdom , Spain , Ireland , Australia , New Zealand , etc . ) , while not increasing fast enough in over-saving countries ( China , Asia , Germany , Japan , etc . ) to compensate for the reduction in these countries &quot; net exports . 
Thus , there is a global slackening of aggregate demand relative to the glut of supply capacity , which will impede a robust global economic recovery . 
There are also now two reasons to fear a double-dip recession . 
First , the exit strategy from monetary and fiscal easing could be botched , because policymakers are damned if they do and damned if they don &apos;t . 
If they take their fiscal deficits ( and a potential monetization of these deficits ) seriously and raise taxes , reduce spending , and mop up excess liquidity , they could undermine the already weak recovery . 
But if they maintain large budget deficits and continue to monetize them , at some point - after the current deflationary forces become more subdued - bond markets will revolt . 
At this point , inflationary expectations will increase , long-term government bond yields will rise , and the recovery will be crowded out . 
A second reason to fear a double-dip recession concerns the fact that oil , energy , and food prices may be rising faster than economic fundamentals warrant , and could be driven higher by the wall of liquidity chasing assets , as well as by speculative demand . 
Last year , oil at $ 145 a barrel was a tipping point for the global economy , as it created a major income shock for the US , Europe , Japan , China , India , and other oil-importing economies . 
The global economy , barely rising from its knees , could not withstand the contractionary shock if similar speculative forces were to drive oil rapidly towards $ 100 a barrel . 
So the end of this severe global recession will be closer at the end of this year than it is now , the recovery will be anemic rather than robust in advanced economies , and there is a rising risk of a double-dip recession . 
The recent market rallies in stocks , commodities , and credit may have gotten ahead of the improvement in the real economy . 
If so , a correction cannot be too far behind .
