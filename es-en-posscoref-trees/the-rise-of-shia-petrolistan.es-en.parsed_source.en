The Rise of Shia Petrolistan 
Now that the dust of the Gulf War has settled over the Middle East , it is clear that some unexpected winners have emerged , blinking in the sunlight . Across the Gulf , Shia Muslims are waking up to their growing political power , their ability to organize themselves - and the gift that lies literally under their feet . 
After years of repression at the hands of Saddam Hussein , the Iraqi Shia are tasting freedom - and spurring their religious counterparts throughout the Gulf to become more assertive . 
They &apos;ve also woken up to the accident of geography that has placed the world &apos;s major oil supplies in areas where they form the majority - Iran , the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and southern Iraq . Welcome to the new commonwealth of &quot; Petrolistan . &quot; 
Their new-found power in this volatile region therefore represents a major challenge to both the old Sunni ruling establishments - outside Iran - and to the United States . 
The years of Shia subservience are over . 
Now they are about to make waves . 
So what are the Shia planning ? 
What is their inspiration ? If they want democracy - will anyone recognize it ? 
Will they be ruled by bearded men in turbans and veiled women - or will we see suits and high heels ? 
It wasn &apos;t until 1979 that the Shia first appeared on western radar screens , emerging in Iran , at the head of a violent revolution that murdered thousands and despatched the Shah into history . 
In Western eyes they became the hostile and militant face of Islam , intent on exporting violence . 
Their Sunni counterparts , even the most fundamentalist Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia , appeared by contrast nicely tame . But the terrorist attacks on America of September 11 , 2001 rewrote that idea for good . The hijackers were all Sunni . 
Their hosts - the Taliban were also Sunni , so are all the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay . 
In the space of a few months , therefore , Sunni Muslims took over from the Shia as threat number one . 
For their part , the Shia minorities claim to welcome democracy . 
But then minorities - especially with a history of subjugation - always do , because it allows them to express their cultural identity and religious freedom . 
In Saudi Arabia , the Shia are at the forefront of those welcoming democratic change and participation . 
Although they constitute only 20 % of the total Saudi population , they form a majority -75 % - of the population in the oil-rich region . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s Shia have suffered discrimination in the professions : in the military , in high government positions , the diplomatic corps , and most significantly , in the oil industry , where they have been excluded since the 1980 &quot; s . 
This systematic neutering of the Shia in Saudi Arabia is legitimised by the Wahhabi religious establishment and supported by numerous fatwas denouncing them as heretics . 
In Bahrain , the Shia who form 75 % of the population have been keen on the reforms initiated by King Hamad Al-Khalifah . 
They have opted for political power under the Sunni minority rather than associating with Iran &apos;s form of government . 
But the new generation of Bahraini Shia are more militant , and their views are increasingly echoed by their Shia counterparts in Saudi Arabia . 
It was the threat of Shia militancy , exported from Iran , that led the region &apos;s rulers to set up the Gulf Cooperation Council in 1981 and attempt to pool their strengths . 
That move was too little too late . 
There was a coup attempt in Bahrain that same year , which came hard on the heels of a Shia uprising in Saudi Arabia the year before . 
Today Iran no longer exports revolution . 
Its experiment with an Islamic form of democracy is now primarily an internal affair . 
In any case none of the Iraqi Ayatollahs who were once exiled in Iran , have any inclination to adopt the Iranian model . 
So far the Shia in Iraq have been relatively quiet , watching the de-Ba &apos;athification process and biding their time . 
But since the capture of Saddam Hussein , they have become increasingly assertive . 
It is on the insistence of the Shia that the United States has had to continually rewrite its blueprint for Iraq . 
From being the region &apos;s losers of the last few decades , the Shia now have the chance to redress the balance , settle old scores - and control the wealth of Petrolistan . 
But they won &apos;t succeed without a struggle - that may in turn be long and bloody .
