To Russia with Social Media 
MOSCOW - I recently was part of a US State Department / White House delegation to Russia . 
Our mission was to foster US-Russian cooperation , in fulfillment of the US &apos;s policies of &quot; 21st-century statecraft &quot; and citizen diplomacy . 
That sounds high-minded , for what the Russians were most interested in was how to build their own Silicon Valley . 
The Russians thought that the way forward was to give tech companies some money and put them near a great university . 
Presto : a new silicon valley . 
For their part , the American delegation assumed that you could pour in some social networking and create a civil society . 
As for me , I went in with my usual cynical notions , born of traveling to Russia every few months for the past 20 years . 
We were a motley crew of nine techies , including eBay CEO John Donahoe , Mozilla Foundation chair Mitchell Baker , and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey . 
And then there was the actor Ashton Kutcher , of whom I had barely heard . 
Despite his fame , he turned out to be a serious techy and an extremely good communicator . 
The lessons we learned on the trip are relevant for anyone who wants to create a Silicon Valley , or even just a &quot; Silicon Valley-style &quot; organization - that is , one that can innovate and implement the innovations , producing profits , happy workers , serial entrepreneurs , and a modern , vibrant economy . 
In fact , I started my discussion with Russia &apos;s government leaders by talking about my experiences as chair of NASA &apos;s Innovation and Technology advisory committee . 
The issue , I said , was not really about funding technology innovation ; it is how to create a culture that rewards thoughtful innovation and considers mistakes the price of learning . 
Another requirement is good customers - that is , customers who are willing to pay good money for good products and good services , who are willing to try out new things that show promise and to give feedback , and who are unwilling to take bribes . 
All this is harder than simply building a university and funding a few start-ups . 
You need to change a culture from the ground up - and then let businesses grow , without too much interference , but with protection from monopolists , bad customers , and bureaucrats . 
In the end , the delegation produced a lengthy document with 21 separate recommendations . 
But , as one Russian later wrote to me : &quot; Over the &#91; last &#93; 20 years , there have been literally hundreds of similar delegations .... Most of their recommendations rest ... on a shelf somewhere , unimplemented and forgotten . &quot; 
So I set my sights on a single project , a potential Russian version of a service recently implemented in the US as Text4Baby , which invites pregnant women to sign up by SMS to receive periodic messages and questions ( weight gain , whether the baby is kicking , whether the woman is drinking ) on their cell phones . 
The system monitors the answers and refers the woman to a clinic if the answers are outside normal range . 
Depending on the surrounding medical infrastructure , it can also send her to a clinic for a routine pre-natal checkup . 
In the US , the project was started by Voxiva Corp. 
Johnson ) and free SMS messages from all the major mobile carriers . 
In Russia , part of the challenge is to find local sponsors . 
But in any market , the biggest challenge is to find someone to take responsibility for the project ( and to find the sponsors ) . 
In Russia , that person is Elena Dmitrieva , head of the Healthy Russia Foundation , who is now engaging with local sponsors and the Russian government , which must supply or at least endorse the medical protocols that the system will implement , and also suggest by geography the clinics to which women should be referred . 
This all sounds like a lot to do , and it is . 
But , as John Donahoe of eBay kept reminding us : &quot; Projects don &apos;t happen unless you have a person responsible , a plan , and a deadline . &quot; 
That sentence , I believe , contains perhaps the single most important piece of wisdom we left behind . 
Beyond that , we fostered connections that happened all around us . 
Most of our meetings were set up traditionally : meet with educators , meet with entrepreneurs , meet with businessmen ( all men ) , high-school students , and so forth . 
But there were a few meetings where the groups mingled , and many occasions when we thought , &quot; Ah , this entrepreneur should meet with that NGO . &quot; 
We have already connected some of them by e-mail . 
Interestingly , it was not just the bureaucrats who seemed to be stuck in old times . 
So were many of the NGO leaders , who railed abstractly against the old Soviet state , while their young assistants sat silently in the background . 
The Russian government ( like the Soviet one before it ) undoubtedly regards civil society as a threat . 
Indeed , some NGOs are a threat . 
But our unspoken message was that civil society is something that should be allowed to flourish if the authorities want a Russian Silicon Valley - or even just a cohesive country . 
Civil society is not just politics : it is a restaurant giving unused food to the poor . 
It is a for-profit company such as Twitter providing its service free to rich and poor alike ( even though advertisers will focus on the rich ) . 
It is successful entrepreneurs mentoring start-up entrepreneurs , and NGOs engaging not just with the government , but also with commercial outfits to get support for activities that will address vexing social problems such as maternal and infant mortality . 
Yes , attentive readers will notice that Elena Dmitrieva does not yet have a deadline for launching Russian Text4Baby . 
We will figure that out when Elena and I meet again in New York City later this month .
