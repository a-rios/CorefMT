Merkel in the Land of Smiles 
BERLIN - Germany &apos;s elections are over . 
The winners and losers are clear , and the political landscape has changed profoundly . 
The real drama , however , occurred not among the country &apos;s main parties but on the boundaries of the political spectrum . 
Chancellor Angela Merkel is celebrating a landslide victory , with her Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) having fallen just short of an outright parliamentary majority . 
But the scale of her triumph is mainly due to the collapse of her liberal coalition partner , the Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) , which for the first time in the German Federal Republic &apos;s history will not be represented in the Bundestag . 
The liberals have always formed a key part of German postwar democracy ; now they are gone . 
Responsibility for that lies , first and foremost , with the FDP . 
No governing party can afford such woefully incompetent ministers and leadership ; 
Merkel had merely to stand back and watch the liberals &quot; public suicide over the last four years . 
The opposition parties , too , paid the price for their failure to come to grips with reality . 
The economy is humming , unemployment is low , and most Germans are better off than ever before . 
But , rather than focusing on the government &apos;s weaknesses - energy , Europe , education , and family policy - they bet their political fortunes on social justice . 
Merkel &apos;s Panglossian campaign was much more in tune with the sentiment of the German electorate than the opposing parties &quot; tristesse about working-class distress , which was rightly seen as a ploy for raising taxes . 
Governing majorities ( and therefore elections ) in Germany are always won in the center . 
Merkel &apos;s predecessor , the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) leader Gerhard Schröder , knew this well . 
But this time her opponents - the SPD , Die Linke ( The Left ) , and the Greens - cleared the center and cannibalized each other on the left . 
The leadership issue made matters worse - the SPD &apos;s Peer Steinbrück and the Greens &quot; Jürgen Trittin never had the slightest chance against Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble . 
The only new factor that could bring about a structural change in German politics is the rise of the new Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) . 
Though its share of the popular vote fell just below the 5 % threshold required to enter the Bundestag , the party performed surprisingly well . 
If its leadership can build on this success , the AfD will make news in next spring &apos;s European Parliament elections . 
Indeed , the AfD scored well in eastern Germany - where three state elections will be held in 2014 - by gaining many votes from The Left . 
This implies that the AfD could establish itself on the German political landscape permanently , which would make a comeback for the FDP all the more difficult . 
Still , despite the FDP &apos;s implosion and the opposition parties &quot; disastrous electoral strategy , Merkel needs a coalition partner . 
The Left is not an option , and any attempt at building a coalition with the Greens - a party that will be reeling from the shock of its poor performance for quite some time - would court instability . 
So Germany will be left with a grand coalition - just as the German electorate wanted . 
The SPD will recoil at the prospect , sit on the fence , and finally give in , because Merkel has a powerful disciplinary instrument : she could call a new election , in which the CDU would probably win an outright majority . 
A grand coalition is not the worst option . 
Nothing fades as quickly as the glow of an election victory , and the German idyll will soon be disturbed by harsh reality - the European Union &apos;s simmering crisis , Syria , Iran , and energy policy . 
The need for consensus is especially acute with respect to the difficult decisions concerning Europe that the German government now faces . 
Greece needs more debt relief . 
A European banking union with joint liability cannot be put off much longer . 
The same is true of many other issues . 
A winter of discontent awaits Merkel , followed by a European election campaign that is likely to bring the CDU back down to earth . 
But no one should expect a significant change in Merkel &apos;s EU policy or her approach to foreign affairs and security questions . 
Her positions on these issues have now been endorsed by a huge portion of the German electorate ; and , from a certain age , most people - including those in high office - do not change easily . 
Besides , in these matters , there is no longer much difference between the center-right CDU and the center-left SPD . 
A grand coalition could show greater flexibility in addressing the euro crisis , but less on questions of foreign and security policy . 
In this respect , however , Germany would gain much from the opportunity to craft a proper foreign policy in the framework of the EU and the Western alliance that in recent years has had a dangerous void where Germany used to be - though this is more a vague hope than a concrete expectation . 
It will also be interesting to see if and how Merkel tackles Germany &apos;s muddled Energiewende ( energy turnaround ) - the move to a low-carbon economy that is the most important domestic project of her tenure . 
Either she will succeed with it , or it will become a monumental disgrace for Germany and a disaster for the German economy . 
The decisive questions now are whether she musters the courage to concentrate all the necessary responsibilities for this mega-project in the energy ministry , and whom she entrusts with overseeing this Herculean task . 
The late editor of the weekly magazine Der Spiegel , Rudolf Augstein , who never liked former Chancellor Helmut Kohl , titled his commentary about German reunification &quot; Congratulations , Chancellor ! &quot; 
For Merkel , Sunday &apos;s election has opened a door , especially with respect to overcoming the euro crisis and to deepening European integration . 
But , until she walks through it , I will refrain from congratulating her .
