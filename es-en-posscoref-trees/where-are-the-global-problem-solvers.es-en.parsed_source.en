Where are the Global Problem Solvers ? 
NEW YORK - One odd and disturbing aspect of global politics today is the confusion between negotiations and problem-solving . 
According to a timetable agreed in December 2007 , we have six months to reach a global agreement on climate change in Copenhagen . 
Governments are engaged in a massive negotiation , but they are not engaged in a massive effort at problem-solving . 
Each country asks itself , &quot; How do I do the least and get the other countries to do the most ? , &quot; when they should be asking instead , &quot; How do we cooperate to achieve our shared goals at minimum cost and maximum benefit ? &quot; 
These might sound like the same thing , but they are not . 
Addressing the problem of climate change requires reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels , which in turn involves choices in technology , some of which already exists and much of which needs to be developed . 
For example , coal plants , if they are to remain a major part of the energy mix , will need to capture and store their CO2 , a process called &quot; carbon capture and sequestration , &quot; or CCS for short . 
Yet this technology remains unproved . 
Similarly , we will need renewed public confidence in a new generation of nuclear power , with plants that are safe and reliably monitored . 
We will need new technologies to mobilize large-scale solar power , wind power , and geothermal power . 
We might try to tap bio-fuels , but only in forms that do not compete with food supplies or with precious environmental assets . 
The list goes on . 
We will need improved energy efficiency , through &quot; green buildings &quot; and more efficient appliances . 
We will need to switch from cars with internal-combustion engines to hybrids , plug-in hybrids , battery-powered , and fuel-cell-powered vehicles . 
Achieving a new generation of electric vehicles will require a decade of public and private partnership to achieve basic technological development ( such as improved batteries ) , a more robust electric grid , new infrastructure for re-charging the automobiles , and much more . 
Similarly , it will take a decade of public and private investments to demonstrate the feasibility of coal-fired plants that capture their carbon dioxide . 
The switchover to new technologies is not mainly a matter of negotiation but of engineering , planning , financing , and incentives . 
How can the world most effectively develop , demonstrate , and then spread these new technologies ? 
Where the benefits are unlikely to accrue to private investors , who should pay for the early demonstration models , which will require billions of dollars ? 
How should we preserve private incentives for research and development while committing to transfer successful technologies to developing countries ? 
These are pressing , unsolved questions . 
Yet the global negotiations on climate change are focusing on a different set of questions . 
The negotiations are mainly about which groups of countries should cut their emissions , by how much , how fast , and relative to which baseline year . 
Countries are being pressed to cut emissions by 2020 by certain percentage targets , without much serious discussion about how the cuts can be achieved . 
The answers depend , of course , on which low-emission technologies will be available , and on how fast they can be deployed . 
Consider the United States . 
To cut emissions sharply , the US will need to switch over this decade to a new fleet of automobiles , powered increasingly by electricity . 
The US will also have to decide on the renewal and expansion of its nuclear power plants , and on the use of public lands to build new renewable energy plants , especially using solar power . 
Yet all of this requires a national plan , not simply a numerical target for emissions reduction . 
Similarly , China , like the US , can reduce CO2 emissions through increased energy efficiency and a new fleet of electric vehicles . 
China &apos;s future choices depend on whether &quot; clean coal &quot; can really work effectively and on a large scale . 
Thus , China &apos;s emissions path depends crucially on early testing of the CCS technologies . 
A true global brainstorming approach would first discuss the best technological and economic options available , and how to improve these options through targeted research and development and better economic incentives . 
The negotiations would discuss the range of options open to each country and region - from CCS to solar , wind , and nuclear power - and would sketch a timetable for a new generation of low-emission automobiles , recognizing that market competition as well as public financing will set the actual pace . 
Based on these building blocks , the world could agree on allocating the costs for speeding the development and spread of new low-emission technologies . 
This global framework would underpin national and global targets for emissions control and for monitoring the progress of the technological overhaul . 
As new technologies are proven , the targets would become more stringent . 
Of course , part of the strategy would be to create market incentives for new low-emission technologies , so that inventors could develop their own ideas with the prospect of large profits if those ideas are right . 
My plea to discuss plans and strategies alongside specific emissions targets might seem to risk impeding the negotiations . 
We need to think hard , and collaboratively , about the world &apos;s real technological options , and then pursue a common global framework that allows us to move into a new era , one based on feasible and sustainable technologies for energy , transport , industry , and buildings .
