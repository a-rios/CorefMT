Ukraine on the Edge 
VIENNA - Seven years ago , Ukraine &apos;s Orange Revolution inspired hope that the country was moving towards genuine democracy . 
Since then , democratic freedoms have been curtailed , the former prime minister and co-leader of the revolution , Yulia Tymoshenko , has been imprisoned , and President Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s regime has become internationally isolated . 
Ukraine is unraveling . 
Today , a small group of oligarchs clustered around Yanukovych have captured power . 
They manipulate elections , control the media , and are shaping the country &apos;s institutions to further their own business interests . 
Condemnation by the West has had no impact . 
So long as they control the country &apos;s industries and natural resources , they will maintain their grip on power - the approach perfected by their role model , former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . 
Whatever one thinks of Tymoshenko , she was not imprisoned for any ostensible crimes she committed while in power . 
She is in prison because she lost that power . 
This sets a dangerous precedent , for it creates a powerful incentive - winner takes all , loser goes to prison - for ruthlessness . 
It is difficult to predict how Tymoshenko &apos;s case will play out - whether Yanukovych will succumb to pressure from the European Union and the United States to release her , or to the forces that want to exclude her from politics forever . 
Until recently , Ukrainian leaders were accustomed to more efficient means than prison for dealing with inconvenient opponents . 
In 2000 , for example , the journalist Georgiy Gongadze was kidnapped and beheaded after publishing online reports about high-level government corruption . 
During the ensuing investigation , former Interior MinisterYuriy Kravchenko died of two gunshots to the head hours before he was to testify . 
Perhaps Tymoshenko herself did not understand how sharply her country had turned away from democratic norms when she mocked Yanukovych and her opponents during her trial . 
Indeed , her first brief imprisonment in 2001 furnished her with political capital and pushed her into the democratic opposition &apos;s front ranks . 
Perhaps Yanukovych himself did not foresee the consequences of Tymoshenko &apos;s arrest , trial , and imprisonment . 
Some Ukrainian conspiracy theorists - of whom there is no shortage - maintain that Yanukovych was tricked by skillfully prepared misinformation provided by the officials around him . 
If the EU refuses to sign an Association Agreement with Ukraine at the upcoming Ukraine-EU summit in Kyiv on December 19 because of Tymoshenko &apos;s imprisonment , the damage to the country will be vast and enduring . 
But , with every month that Tymoshenko spends in jail - more than three so far - her martyrdom grows , making it harder for Yanukovych to free her . 
Yanukovych has become hostage to a situation that he created - and thus has done nothing to extricate himself from it . 
Russia &apos;s then-president , Vladimir Putin , put himself in an analogous bind in 2003 with the arrest of the oil oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky . 
At the time , Khodorkovsky was the wealthiest man in Russia and an open critic of the Russian government , so his arrest triggered a storm of international protest . 
Like Yanukovych , Putin is under pressure from the West to release his opponent , but the political risk is too great . 
Yanukovych &apos;s goals are unclear . 
He does not respond to European pressure , even though Ukraine would gain political leverage from closer EU ties . 
Perhaps he simply dislikes the EU because it applauded his defeat in the Orange Revolution , and because he makes embarrassing gaffes whenever he goes there . 
Then again , perhaps he has learned from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that the EU has little influence over non-EU countries &quot; internal politics . 
At the first positive sign from Belarus , the EU forgives and forgets . 
Indeed , even without a positive signal from Ukraine , the European Parliament has recommended that negotiations on the Association Agreement begin . 
Generally , Yanukovych &apos;s foreign policy appears reactive . 
In 2010 , for example , he bowed to Putin &apos;s pressure to extend the Russian lease on naval facilities in Crimea to 2042 , whereas Tymoshenko and others pointed to the treaty &apos;s unconstitutionality . 
Yanukovych also undermined Ukraine &apos;s geopolitical strength vis-Ã -vis Russia by rejecting NATO &apos;s invitation to join in 2010 . 
Even if the Kremlin is not particularly happy with the planned EU-Ukraine Association Agreement , it has little reason to worry as long as Yanukovych remains a weak president in a divided country . 
Ukraine is thus becoming a dangerous mix of authoritarianism and corrupt capitalism . 
In Belarus , an impoverished Lukashenko increasingly resorts to brute force to maintain his rule - breaking up peaceful demonstrations , imprisoning political opponents , and terrorizing the intelligentsia . 
Compared to him , Berlusconi is a shining example of good government . 
But , as Yanukovych and his backers are well aware , Berlusconi is gone , and Lukashenko is not .
