Re-Booting DDT 
PALO ALTO - Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is fascinating . 
So is the 19-page annual letter that describes the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the world &apos;s largest philanthropy . 
But for someone as smart as Gates , who can afford to hire experts on any subject under the sun , some of his foundation &apos;s strategies are baffling . 
Consider his foundation &apos;s approach to malaria , which focuses on bed nets , a low-tech , only modestly effective intervention , and on the development of a vaccine , a high-tech solution that has eluded intensive efforts for decades . 
This approach dismisses an old , cheap , and safe way to control the vector - the Anopheles mosquito - that spreads the disease : the chemical DDT . 
Malaria is a scourge , particularly for inhabitants of poor tropical countries . 
Forty-one percent of the world &apos;s population live in areas where malaria is transmitted , with 350-500 million cases each year . 
The disease imposes substantial costs on individuals , families , and governments . 
Costs to individuals and their families include drugs , travel to and treatment at clinics , lost time at work and school , and expenses for preventive measures . 
Costs to governments include maintenance of health facilities , purchases of drugs and supplies , public-health interventions such as spraying insecticide or distributing insecticide-treated bed nets , and lost revenue from taxes and tourism . 
Such costs are a huge economic burden on malaria-prone countries and impede their development . 
It has been estimated that annual economic growth in countries with a high incidence of malaria is 1.3 percentage points lower than that of other countries . 
Drugs called artemisinins are safe and exhibit potent , rapid anti-malarial activity . 
In combination with other anti-malarials , they have been used effectively for several years to treat multiple-drug-resistant malaria . 
But resistance has arisen and will surely increase , so that in the absence of a vaccine , elimination of the mosquitoes that spread the disease is the key to preventing epidemics . 
Unfortunately , flawed public policy limits the available options . 
In 1972 , on the basis of data on toxicity to fish and migrating birds ( but not to humans ) , the United States Environmental Protection Agency banned virtually all uses of DDT , an inexpensive and effective pesticide once widely deployed to kill disease-carrying insects . 
DDT was subsequently banned for agricultural use worldwide under the 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants , which stigmatized the chemical and effectively constituted a prohibition . 
A basic principle of toxicology is that the dose makes the poison . 
Although DDT is a ( modestly ) toxic substance , there is a world of difference between applying large amounts of it in the environment - as farmers did before it was banned - and using it carefully and sparingly to fight mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects . 
( When it is used at all now , it is now sprayed indoors in small amounts to prevent mosquitoes from nesting . ) 
The regulators who banned DDT also failed to take into consideration the inadequacy of alternatives . 
Because it persists after spraying , DDT works far better than many pesticides now in use , some of which are toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms . 
With DDT unavailable , many mosquito-control authorities are depleting their budgets by repeated spraying with short-acting , marginally effective insecticides . 
Moreover , even if mosquitoes become resistant to the killing effects of DDT , they are still repelled by it . 
An occasional dusting of window frames and doorframes is extremely effective . 
Bill Gates &apos;s experts seem not to know that ; the foundation &apos;s annual letter contains the following single mention of DDT : &quot; The world hoped in the 1950s and 1960s that &#91; malaria &#93; could be eliminated by killing mosquitoes with DDT , but that tactic failed when the mosquitoes evolved to be resistant to the chemical . &quot; 
Since DDT was banned , insect-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue have been on the rise . 
In fact , the huge toll of diseases spread by mosquitoes has led some public-health officials to rethink DDT &apos;s use . 
In 2006 , after roughly 50 million preventable deaths , the United Nations &quot; World Health Organization reversed course and endorsed the use of DDT to kill and repel Anopheles mosquitoes . 
Arata Kochi , the WHO official in charge of malaria said , &quot; We must take a position based on the science and the data . 
One of the best tools we have against malaria is indoor residual spraying . 
Of the dozen or so insecticides WHO has approved as safe for house spraying , the most effective is DDT . &quot; 
But policies based on science and data have a short half-life at the UN . 
With a notable absence of fanfare , in May 2009 the WHO , together with the UN Environment Program , reverted to endorsing less effective methods for preventing malaria , announcing that their goal is &quot; to achieve a 30 % cut in the application of DDT worldwide by 2014 and its total phase-out by the early 2020s , if not sooner . &quot; 
In the absence of effective vaccines or new anti-malarial drugs - and the funding and infrastructure to deliver them - this decision is tantamount to mass murder , a triumph of radical environmental politics over public health . 
How can we drain the public-policy swamp ? 
First , governments should re-evaluate the voluminous data on DDT that have been compiled since the 1970 &quot; s , and they should make DDT available immediately for mosquito control indoors . 
Second , governments should oppose international restrictions on DDT and withhold all funding from UN agencies that oppose the use of the &quot; best available technology &quot; ( including DDT ) to control mosquito-borne diseases . 
Third , public-health officials should embark on a campaign to educate local authorities and citizens about the DDT . 
People now hear only the reflexively anti-pesticide drumbeat of the environmental movement , the lamentable legacy of the benighted Rachel Carson and her acolytes . 
And oh , yes , it would be helpful if the world &apos;s greatest philanthropist were to throw his weight behind removing the stigma on DDT .
