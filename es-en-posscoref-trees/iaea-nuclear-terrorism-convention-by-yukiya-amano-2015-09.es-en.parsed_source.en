Stopping a Dirty Bomb 
VIENNA - Nuclear terrorism is , in the words of US President Barack Obama , &quot; the gravest danger we face . &quot; 
But while few would dispute this characterization , the world has unfinished business in minimizing the threat . 
Ten years after world leaders agreed to amend the landmark 1987 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material ( CPPNM ) to make it harder for terrorists to obtain nuclear material , the new measures have yet to enter into force . 
The resulting vulnerability needs to be addressed urgently . 
In July 2005 , signatories to the CPPNM agreed to amend the Convention to address the risk of terrorism more effectively . 
The new measures that were introduced would make it more difficult for terrorists to cause a widespread release of radioactive material by attacking a nuclear power plant or detonating a radioactive dispersal device - commonly known as a dirty bomb . 
But before the amendment can enter into force , two-thirds of the 152 signatories to the original convention must ratify it . 
While significant progress has been made - in July , the US , Italy , and Turkey did so - at least 14 more countries are needed . 
The fact that there has never been a major terrorist attack involving nuclear or other radioactive material should not blind us to the severity of the threat . 
There is evidence that terrorist groups have tried to acquire the material needed to construct a crude nuclear explosive device , or a dirty bomb . 
In 2011 , for example , Moldovan police seized highly enriched uranium from a group of smugglers who were trying to sell it . 
The smugglers , exhibiting a worrying level of technical knowledge , had tried to evade detection by building a shielded container . 
In this case , the story ended happily . 
Thanks to efforts by Moldova , with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to boost its nuclear security capabilities , the material was identified and confiscated , and the smugglers were arrested . 
There is no way to know whether the smuggling effort uncovered in Moldova is an outlier or the tip of a very large iceberg . 
Since 1999 , the amount of such material being used for peaceful purposes has increased by 70 % - a trend that will continue as the use of nuclear power grows . 
It is essential that effective measures are in place to ensure that these materials are not misused or misplaced , whether accidentally or intentionally . 
Since 1995 , the IAEA &apos;s member states have reported nearly 2,800 incidents involving radioactive material escaping regulatory control . 
Although only a handful of these incidents involved material that could be used to make a nuclear explosive device , a relatively small amount of radioactive material could be combined with conventional explosives to create a dirty bomb . 
Much has been achieved in the secure management of nuclear material since the attacks on the United States in September 2001 prompted a renewed focus on the risks of terrorism . 
Many countries have instituted effective measures to prevent the theft , sabotage , or illegal transfer of nuclear or other radioactive material , and security at many nuclear facilities has been improved . 
But much more needs to be done . 
The original Convention focused only on the international transport of nuclear material , and did not cover the protection of nuclear facilities . 
The amendment adopted ten years ago would oblige countries to protect nuclear facilities and any nuclear material used , stored , or transported domestically . 
It would expand cooperation on locating and recovering stolen or smuggled nuclear material and coordinate the response to any attack on a nuclear facility . 
It would also make nuclear trafficking a criminal offense and require signatories to cooperate on improving national systems of physical protection and minimizing the consequences of sabotage . 
Protecting nuclear material is not just an issue for countries that use nuclear power . 
Terrorists and criminals will try to exploit any vulnerability in the global security system . 
Any country , in any part of the world , could find itself used as a transit point - just as any country could become the target of an attack . 
Effective international cooperation is critically important . 
The consequences of a major security failure could be a catastrophe that transcends borders . 
All countries must take the threat of nuclear terrorism seriously . 
The single most effective way to do so would be to ensure that the amendment to the CPPNM enters into force as soon as possible .
