The UN Takes Charge 
NEW YORK - While discussions about economic &quot; green shoots &quot; continue unabated in the United States , in many countries , and especially in the developing world , matters are getting worse . 
The downturn in the US began with a failure in the financial system , which quickly was translated into a slowdown in the real economy . 
But , in the developing world , it is just the opposite : a decline in exports , reduced remittances , lower foreign direct investment , and precipitous falls in capital flows have led to economic weakening . 
As a result , even countries with good regulatory systems are now confronting problems in their financial sectors . 
On June 23 , a United Nations conference focusing on the global economic crisis and its impact on developing countries reached a consensus both about the causes of the downturn and why it was affecting developing countries so badly . 
It outlined some of the measures that should be considered and established a working group to explore the way forward , possibly under the guidance of a newly established expert group . 
The agreement was remarkable : in providing what in many ways was a clearer articulation of the crisis and what needs to be done than that offered by the G-20 , the UN showed that decision-making needn &apos;t be restricted to a self-selected club , lacking political legitimacy , and largely dominated by those who had considerable responsibility for the crisis in the first place . 
Indeed , the agreement showed the value of a more inclusive approach - for example , by asking key questions that might be too politically sensitive for some of the larger countries to raise , or by pointing out concerns that resonate with the poorest , even if they are less important for the richest . 
One might have thought that the United States would have taken a leadership role , since the crisis was made there . 
Indeed , the US Treasury ( including some officials who are currently members of President Barack Obama &apos;s economic team ) pushed capital- and financial-market liberalization , which resulted in the rapid contagion of America &apos;s problems around the world . 
While there was less American leadership than one would have hoped , indeed expected under the circumstances , many participants were simply relieved that America did not put up obstacles to reaching a global consensus , as would have been the case if George W. Bush were still president . 
One might have hoped that America would be the first to offer large amounts of money to help the many innocent victims of the policies it had championed . 
But it did not , and Obama had to fight hard to extract even limited amounts for the International Monetary Fund from a reluctant Congress . 
But many developing countries have just emerged from being overburdened with debt ; they do not want to go through that again . 
The implication is that they need grants , not loans . 
The G-20 , which turned to the IMF to provide most of the money that the developing countries need to cope with the crisis , did not take sufficient note of this ; the UN conference did . 
The most sensitive issue touched upon by the UN conference - too sensitive to be discussed at the G-20 - was reform of the global reserve system . 
The build-up of reserves contributes to global imbalances and insufficient global aggregate demand , as countries put aside hundreds of billions of dollars as a precaution against global volatility . 
Not surprisingly , America , which benefits by getting trillions of dollars of loans from developing countries - now at almost no interest - was not enthusiastic about the discussion . 
But , whether the US likes it or not , the dollar reserve system is fraying ; the question is only whether we move from the current system to an alternative in a haphazard way , or in a more careful and structured way . 
Those with large amounts of reserves know that holding dollars is a bad deal : no or low return and a high risk of inflation or currency depreciation , either of which would diminish their holdings &quot; real value . 
On the last day of the conference , as America was expressing its reservations about even discussing at the UN this issue which affects all countries &quot; well being , China was once again reiterating that the time had come to begin working on a global reserve currency . 
Since a country &apos;s currency can be a reserve currency only if others are willing to accept it as such , time may be running out for the dollar . 
Emblematic of the difference between the UN and the G-20 conferences was the discussion of bank secrecy : whereas the G-20 focused on tax evasion , the UN Conference addressed corruption , too , which some experts contend gives rise to outflows from some of the poorest countries that are greater than the foreign assistance they receive . 
The US and other advanced industrial countries pushed globalization . 
If globalization is to work for everyone , decisions about how to manage it must be made in a democratic and inclusive manner - with the participation of both the perpetrators and the victims of the mistakes . 
The UN , notwithstanding all of its flaws , is the one inclusive international institution . 
This UN conference , like an earlier one on financing for developing countries , demonstrated the key role that the UN must play in any global discussion about reforming the global financial and economic system .
