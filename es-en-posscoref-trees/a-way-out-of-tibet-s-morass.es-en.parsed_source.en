A Way out of Tibet &apos;s Morass 
NEW YORK - China has survived the 50th anniversary of the failed uprising by Tibetans against Chinese rule in 1959 without major protests . 
But , to keep Tibetans off the streets , China &apos;s government had to saturate the entire Tibetan plateau with troops and secretly detain in unmarked jails hundreds of people for &quot; legal education . &quot; 
Those moves suggest that Tibet has become an increasingly serious concern for China &apos;s rulers , one that they have not yet found ways to handle without damaging their standing in Tibet and around the world . 
A year ago , Chinese and Western intellectuals competed in dismissing popular interest in Tibet as a childlike confusion with the imaginary Shangri-la of the 1937 film Lost Horizon . 
But after more than 150 protests in Tibet against Chinese rule over the past 12 months , concerns about the area seem anything but fanciful . 
Indeed , Tibet could soon replace Taiwan as a factor in regional stability and an important issue in international relations . 
The areas populated by Tibetans cover a quarter of China ; to have such a large part of the country &apos;s territory under military control and cut off from the outside world weakens the Communist Party &apos;s claims to legitimacy and world power status . 
Last year &apos;s protests were the largest and most widespread in Tibet for decades . 
Participants included nomads , farmers , and students , who in theory should have been the most grateful to China for modernizing Tibet &apos;s economy . 
Many carried the forbidden Tibetan national flag , suggesting that they think of Tibet as a separate country in the past , and in about 20 incidents government offices were burned down . 
In one case , there were even attacks on Chinese migrants , leading to 18 deaths . 
It is hard not to see these events as a challenge to China &apos;s rule . 
The government &apos;s reaction was to blame the problem on outside instigation . 
It sent in more troops , hid details of protestors &quot; deaths , gave a life sentence to an AIDS educator who had copied illegal CDs from India , and for months banned foreigners and journalists from the Tibetan plateau . 
In November , Chinese officials , live on national TV , ridiculed Tibetan exiles &quot; proposals for negotiation . 
They canceled a European summit because of a meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the Dalai Lama , and regularly imply that Tibetans are terrorists . 
On March 28 , Tibetans in Lhasa had to celebrate &quot; Serf Emancipation Day &quot; to endorse China &apos;s explanation for its take-over 50 years ago . 
But such class-struggle terminology reminds people of the Cultural Revolution and , since such language would be unimaginable in inland China today , only makes Tibet seem more separate . 
Although both sides claim to be ready for dialogue , they are talking at cross-purposes : the exiles say that talks must be based on their autonomy proposals , while China says that it will discuss only the Dalai Lama &apos;s &quot; personal status &quot; - where he would live in Beijing should he return to China . 
Visceral sparring matches are continuing , with the Dalai Lama recently describing Tibetans &quot; lives under China as a &quot; hell on earth . &quot; 
He was almost certainly referring to life during the Maoist years rather than the present , but his remarks enabled China to issue more media attacks and raise the political temperature further . 
Western governments have been accused of interference , but it is unlikely that any want to derail their relations with China , especially during an economic crisis . 
Last October , British Foreign Minister David Miliband was so anxious to maintain Chinese good will that he came close to denouncing his predecessors &quot; recognition of Tibet &apos;s autonomy 100 years ago . 
But foreign concerns about the status of China &apos;s mandate in Tibet are understandable : Tibet is the strategic high ground between the two most important nuclear powers in Asia . 
Good governance on the plateau is good for everyone . 
China could help to lessen growing tensions by recognizing these concerns as reasonable . 
The Dalai Lama could cut down on foreign meetings and acknowledge that , despite China &apos;s general emasculation of intellectual and religious life in Tibet , some aspects of Tibetan culture ( like modern art , film and literature ) are relatively healthy . 
Western observers could accept the exiles &quot; assurances that their proposals on autonomy are negotiable and not bottom-line demands , rather than damning them before talks start . 
All sides would gain by paying attention to two Tibetan officials in China who dared to speak out last month . 
A retired prefectural governor from Kardze told the Singapore paper 
The Party has so far been following a more conventional strategy : last week it sent a delegation of officials to the US ( the first ever sent , it said , to have been composed solely of Tibetans - a fact that one might expect them to have been embarrassed to admit ) and had its leader , Shingtsa Tenzin Choedak , tell journalists that Tibetans enjoy freedom of religion . 
As anyone who has worked in Tibet recently knows well , this was an inexactitude : since at least 1996 , all Tibetans who work for the government and all Tibetan students in Tibet have been forbidden any Buddhist practice , even though it is illegal under Chinese law to stop people from practicing an official religion . 
China &apos;s government could improve the situation overnight by sacking the officials responsible for such illegal policies , and by apologizing to Tibetans for having overlooked such abuses for 15 years . 
And it could start reassessing its Tibetan policies instead of increasing controls and allegations . 
Until then , China &apos;s quest for international respect is set to remain elusive and Tibet is likely to stay on the world &apos;s agenda .
