Pakistan on the Precipice 
ISLAMABAD - Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari abruptly returned to Karachi on the morning of December 19 , following a 13-day absence for medical treatment in Dubai , where he lived while in exile . 
The government issued no a formal statement about Zadari &apos;s health , but his supporters disclosed that he had suffered a mild stroke , which left him unconscious for several minutes . 
Zardari &apos;s sudden return fueled speculation about his future , but , more importantly , about the future of civilian rule in Pakistan . 
His decision followed a three-hour meeting between Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani and General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani , the Pakistani army &apos;s chief of the army . 
His choice of destination - Karachi , Pakistan &apos;s largest city and his political base , rather than Islamabad , the county &apos;s capital - suggests the depth of the crisis now bubbling below the surface . 
Zardari has held power since 2008 , having been elected eight months after the assassination of his wife , Benazir Bhutto . 
Even after a constitutional amendment in 2010 made the prime minister the country &apos;s chief executive , Zardari has continued to be the main decision-maker . 
His political rise is thus in keeping with South Asia &apos;s tradition of quasi-democratic dynastic politics : he assumed leadership of Bhutto &apos;s Pakistan People &apos;s Party ( PPP ) - founded in 1967 by her father , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto - and appointed his son Bilawal as the party &apos;s co-chairperson , basing his decision on a handwritten will left by his wife . 
To underscore the link , the son was renamed Bilawal Bhutto Zardari . 
But , having deftly out-maneuvered his opponents for three years , Zardari seems to have misread the current political environment , for Pakistan is not the same country in which his wife and father-in-law wielded power . 
By trying to play by the old rules , he committed several mistakes that may ultimately cost him his job and the Bhutto family its hold on power . 
As many other Pakistani leaders have done before before him , Zardari has relied on American support to stay where he is . 
This worked for some time , but an alleged attempt to involve the United States more openly in Pakistani politics weakened , rather than strengthened , his hold on power . 
Indeed , while the Arab Spring ended the old corrupt bargain that kept so many autocratic rulers in power across the Muslim world , Zardari and his associates appear not to have received the message . 
It was widely believed that Husain Haqqani , Pakistan &apos;s ambassador to the US , had attempted to enlist America &apos;s help in preventing yet another military coup . 
An unsigned memorandum , believed to have been written at Haqqani &apos;s suggestion , was sent to Admiral Mike Mullen , then Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , seeking American help in exchange for fighting extremists in Pakistan &apos;s tribal areas who were complicating America &apos;s efforts to extract itself from Afghanistan . 
What the lively Pakistani media dubbed &quot; memogate &quot; forced Haqqani to resign and enabled the Supreme Court to assert its authority by deciding to investigate the matter . 
The court was already casting an eye at Zadari by examining the deal between former President Pervez Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto . 
In exchange for the withdrawal of corruption cases against her , Zardari , and several of their friends and associates , Bhutto agreed to support Musharraf after the elections scheduled for December 2007 . 
The Bush administration , eager to have a democratically elected government in Pakistan to continue the fight against terrorism , was believed to have brokered the agreement . 
That arrangement has now been struck down by the Supreme Court , which ordered the government to reopen corruption cases , including one in Switzerland , where Zardari is alleged to have parked tens of millions of dollars . 
The government balked , and now the Court is working to ensure that the executive branch carries out its orders . 
But Zardari &apos;s decision to begin grooming his 23-year old son for power may have been his gravest mistake . 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto anointed his wife and daughter to be the PPP &apos;s co-chairpersons in case he was executed by the military regime that had overthrown him . 
Benazir Bhutto , in turn , placed control of the party in the hands of her husband and son . 
But , this time , an awakened citizenry was not inclined to readily accept that political leadership could be passed on so easily from father to daughter , from wife to husband , from father to son . 
Political change in Pakistan is assured , but it will come about in a way that cannot be foreseen . 
The Arab Spring , America &apos;s declining influence in the Muslim world , and citizens &quot; determination to be heard have combined to create an environment in which the unprecedented and the unpredictable are the only certainties .
