The Greater Depression 
BERKELEY - First it was the 2007 financial crisis . 
Then it became the 2008 financial crisis . 
Next it was the downturn of 2008-2009 . 
Finally , in mid-2009 , it was dubbed the &quot; Great Recession . &quot; 
And , with the business cycle &apos;s shift onto an upward trajectory in late 2009 , the world breathed a collective a sigh of relief . 
We would not , it was believed , have to move on to the next label , which would inevitably contain the dreaded D-word . 
But the sense of relief was premature . 
Contrary to the claims of politicians and their senior aides that the &quot; summer of recovery &quot; had arrived , the United States did not experience a V-shaped pattern of economic revival , as it did after the recessions of the late 1970s and early 1980s . 
And the US economy remained far below its previous growth trend . 
Indeed , from 2005 to 2007 , America &apos;s real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP grew at just over 3 % annually . 
During the 2009 trough , the figure was 11 % lower - and it has since dropped by an additional 5 % . 
The situation is even worse in Europe . 
Instead of a weak recovery , the eurozone experienced a second-wave contraction beginning in 2010 . 
At the trough , the eurozone &apos;s real GDP amounted to 8 % less than the 1995-2007 trend ; today , it is 15 % lower . 
Cumulative output losses relative to the 1995-2007 trends now stand at 78 % of annual GDP for the US , and at 60 % for the eurozone . 
That is an extraordinarily large amount of foregone prosperity - and a far worse outcome than was expected . 
In 2007 , nobody foresaw the decline in growth rates and potential output that statistical and policymaking agencies are now baking into their estimates . 
By 2011 , it was clear - at least to me - that the Great Recession was no longer an accurate moniker . 
It was time to begin calling this episode &quot; the Lesser Depression . &quot; 
But the story does not end there . 
Today , the North Atlantic economy faces two additional downward shocks . 
The first , as Lorcan Roche Kelly of Agenda Research noted , was discussed by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi while extemporizing during a recent speech . 
Draghi began by acknowledging that , in Europe , inflation has declined from around 2.5 % in mid-2012 to 0.4 % today . 
He then argued that we can no longer assume that the drivers of this trend - such as a drop in food and energy prices , high unemployment , and the crisis in Ukraine - are temporary in nature . 
In fact , inflation has been declining for so long that it is now threatening price stability - and inflation expectations continue to fall . 
The five-year swap rate - an indicator of medium-term inflation expectations - has fallen by 15 basis points since mid-2012 , to less than 2 % . 
Moreover , as Draghi noted , real short- and medium-term rates have increased ; long-term rates have not , owing to a decline in long-term nominal rates that extends far beyond the eurozone . 
Draghi &apos;s subsequent declaration that the ECB Governing Council will use &quot; all the available unconventional instruments &quot; to safeguard price stability and anchor inflation expectations over the medium-to-long term is telling . 
The pretense that the eurozone is on a path toward recovery has collapsed ; the only realistic way to read the financial markets is to anticipate a triple-dip recession . 
Meanwhile , in the US , the Federal Reserve under Janet Yellen is no longer wondering whether it is appropriate to stop purchasing long-term assets and raise interest rates until there is a significant upturn in employment . 
Instead , despite the absence of a significant increase in employment or a substantial increase in inflation , the Fed already is cutting its asset purchases and considering when , not whether , to raise interest rates . 
A year and a half ago , those who expected a return by 2017 to the path of potential output - whatever that would be - estimated that the Great Recession would ultimately cost the North Atlantic economy about 80 % of one year &apos;s GDP , or $ 13 trillion , in lost production . 
If such a five-year recovery began now - a highly optimistic scenario - it would mean losses of about $ 20 trillion . 
If , as seems more likely , the economy performs over the next five years as it has for the last two , then takes another five years to recover , a massive $ 35 trillion worth of wealth would be lost . 
When do we admit that it is time to call what is happening by its true name ?
