Democracy Begins At Home 
The Bush administration has put expansion of democracy at the center of its foreign policy . 
This is a far nobler calling than simply expanding American hegemony . 
The Bush administration praised Saudi Arabia &apos;s municipal elections , but what about the rights of women - including their voting rights ? 
It welcomed ( if it did not actively participate in ) the toppling of Venezuela &apos;s democratically elected leader , but it continues to support Pakistan &apos;s military dictator . 
It criticizes Russian President Vladimir Putin , but only after he goes against business interests . 
And it may raise concerns about media concentration in Russia , but remains silent about media concentration in Italy . 
There is a taint of hypocrisy in a more fundamental sense . 
The Bush administration is right to emphasize the importance of elections , without which democracy is inconceivable . 
But democracy entails more than periodic elections , and the legitimacy of elections depends on the public &apos;s confidence in the electoral process itself . 
In this respect , the last two American presidential elections have hardly been models for the world . 
Former President Jimmy Carter , whose Atlanta center monitors elections around the globe , has raised questions about whether America &apos;s recent election lives up to the standards the United States should uphold . 
Where former President Bill Clinton sought to ensure that all Americans who are entitled to vote are registered to vote , the Republicans have tried to reverse these advances , putting obstacles in the way both of registration and voting . 
Modern technology makes it easy to have a paper trail for voting machines , at little cost ; yet several states chose not to provide this minimal safeguard . 
Beyond elections , citizens can provide an effective check on government only if they are well informed . 
That is why right-to-know laws are so important . 
Of course , politicians prefer to work in secrecy , without oversight . 
No one can imagine hiring a worker , but allowing him not to inform his employer about what he is doing on the job . 
Politicians work for the citizenry , which has the right to know what their employees are doing . 
Citizens have the right to know how their money is being spent and who is being consulted to form policy . 
They have the right to know whether Enron and the oil companies are shaping energy policy . 
They have the right to know why America , and the world , was misled by false claims about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq . 
My research has focused on the consequences of asymmetries in information for the functioning of the economy . 
But a lack of accurate information has equally , if not more , severe consequences for political processes . 
The decision to go to war in Iraq is the most dramatic example of this , but there have been many others in America under Bush . 
Providing drug benefits under Medicare , America &apos;s health-care program for the aged , may have been the right decision . 
But restricting government &apos;s ability to bargain with the drug companies was a pure give-away , and nothing justifies providing grossly distorted information about the costs - now estimated to be in excess of 1.1 trillion over the next decade . 
This is three times the amount original projected by the Bush administration . 
Today , the Bush administration is engaged in a disinformation campaign about an impending social security crisis . 
While something should be done , the magnitude of the problem hardly foreshadows a crisis . 
On the contrary , the system could almost surely be put on a solid footing for the next 75 years with a fraction of what was spent on the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts . 
Good information requires not just the right to know , but also the right to tell - a diversified media . 
There are , as we noted , justified complaints about the lack of diversity in television broadcasting in Russia , yet Bush has not opposed efforts by America &apos;s Federal Communications Commission to weaken laws on media concentration . 
Democracy also requires recognizing the rights of individuals . 
Undermining any individual &apos;s rights jeopardizes everyone &apos;s rights . 
Yet under Bush , the US has undermined basic civil rights , such as habeas corpus , which guarantees individuals recourse to judicial review when the state detains them . 
The extended detention of dozens of individuals in Guantanamo - without charge and without trial - is a basic abrogation of this right . 
Fortunately , even if Bush does not understand such basic principles , America &apos;s courts do , and they are now , albeit belatedly , forcing his administration to abide by them . 
Finally , of what value is the right to vote without recognition of the right to a certain minimal standard of living , as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ? 
In countries where much of the population lives below subsistence level , buying votes is all too easy . 
But the only economic rights the Bush administration recognizes are intellectual property rights , putting the interests of drug companies ahead of those with life threatening diseases , and the free mobility of capital , which has had such devastating effects on many countries . 
America &apos;s democracy remains the envy of much of the world , and it is good that the Bush administration now champions the expansion of democracy forcefully . 
But the administration would be far more credible , and have far more success , if it took a closer look at home , if it examined its own practices more honestly , and if it engaged in a broader discussion of what democracy really means .
