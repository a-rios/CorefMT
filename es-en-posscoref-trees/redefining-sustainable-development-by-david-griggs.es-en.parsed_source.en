Redefining Sustainable Development 
MELBOURNE - Albert Einstein once said that if he had just one hour to find a solution on which his life depended , he would spend the first 55 minutes defining the problem . 
Once he knew the right question to ask , he could solve the problem in less than five minutes . 
Today , humanity faces such a life-threatening problem : How are we to provide adequate nutrition and a decent quality of life to a global population that is set to surpass nine billion by 2050 , without irreparably damaging our planetary life-support system ? 
To find a solution , we must start by clarifying the problem . 
Humans have fundamentally altered Earth &apos;s ecosystems . 
By interfering with the carbon , nitrogen , water , and phosphorus cycles , human activity changes the atmosphere , oceans , waterways , forests , and ice sheets , and diminishes biodiversity . 
Indeed , the effects of human behavior on the planet &apos;s ecosystems have become so significant in the last few centuries that many scientists now believe that the planet has entered a new geological epoch , dubbed the Anthropocene . 
As the environmental consequences of human activity become increasingly apparent , so does humanity &apos;s responsibility to mitigate them . 
Last year , at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , world leaders agreed to create a set of universal Sustainable Development Goals , which would change the playing field for future economic policy to safeguard our life-support system . 
That &apos;s easy to say . 
But where does one start ? 
For almost three decades , sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present , without compromising future generations &quot; ability to meet their needs . 
Related policies have reflected the view that sustainable development rests on three equal pillars : the economy , society , and the environment . 
But this view is no longer tenable . 
As the United States Global Change Research Program &apos;s recently released draft report on climate change points out , some kinds of weather events have become more common , and more intense , in recent years . 
In 2012 alone , Arctic sea-ice dipped to a new low , as an area larger than the US melted ; unprecedented heat waves struck Australia , and other areas ; record floods hit China and Japan ; and the United Kingdom had its wettest year on record . 
But global responses remain inadequate . 
A new approach is needed . 
Rather than separate pillars of sustainable development , the economy must be seen as servicing society , which in turn thrives within a secure natural environment . 
Viewed this way , sustainable development should be redefined as &quot; development that meets the needs of the present while safeguarding the Earth &apos;s life-support system , on which the welfare of current and future generations depends . &quot; 
After all , a healthy , thriving planet is a prerequisite for healthy , prosperous lives . 
The process of identifying the Sustainable Development Goals , which are intended to enter into force in 2015 , has begun in earnest . 
Last week , representatives from 69 countries met at the UN in New York , and an expert group meets this week . 
The goals must have measurable , achievable objectives that extend beyond national policy ; they must inspire regional and local administrations , businesses , civil society , and individuals everywhere to change their behavior . 
They should create goals for humanity that are grounded in shared values - and in relevant science . 
This week , my colleagues and I published a report called Sustainable Development Goals for People and Planet , which outlines what is required . 
We identified six universal goals for sustainable development : lives and livelihoods , food security , water sustainability , clean energy , healthy ecosystems , and good governance . 
The next step is to define measurable targets , such as better lives for slum dwellers or reduced deforestation . 
Genuine progress in any of the six target areas will require a comprehensive approach , with policies that span the economic , social , and environmental domains . 
For example , eradicating poverty entails the provision of food , water , energy , and access to gainful employment . 
But providing energy to all will require governments to discontinue subsidies for fossil fuels and unsustainable agriculture . 
And achieving food security is impossible without agricultural systems and practices that not only support farmers and produce enough food to meet people &apos;s nutritional needs , but that also preserve natural resources by , for example , preventing soil erosion and relying on more efficient nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers . 
The Millennium Development Goals , due to expire in 2015 , succeeded because they marshaled international resources and funding to address a focused set of poverty-related issues . 
The Sustainable Development Goals must go a step further . 
Like Einstein &apos;s thought experiment , many lives depend on it .
