Towards a Wider Europe 
According to the European security document adopted in 2003 , &quot; It is in the interest of the European Union to promote a ring of well-governed countries on its borders with whom it can enjoy close and cooperative relations . &quot; 
The European Commission is now elaborating this principle in the form of a &quot; Wider Europe Initiative . &quot; 
But the initiative cannot fulfill its great promise as long as it stays within the Brussels bureaucracy . 
It needs to become a political initiative . 
The EU needs to reach out to its less developed neighbors . 
This is of vital interest to Europe but it cannot succeed without adequate political and financial support . 
The most powerful tool that the EU has for influencing political and economic developments in neighboring countries is the prospect of membership . 
Unfortunately , the problems created by the current enlargement make it unrealistic to hold out membership to additional countries beyond the ones now under consideration - Bulgaria , Romania , Turkey , and possibly the Balkan countries . 
In the past , the road to membership was paved with Association Agreements . 
The defining characteristic of the countries on the Eastern and Southern borders of Europe is that they lack many attributes needed for membership . 
The Wider Europe Initiative is meant to help develop those attributes . 
Association Agreements , although desirable , may not be adequate , as the EU &apos;s Balkan experiences indicate . 
The EU began with the right idea in the Balkans : to bring those countries closer to each other by bringing them closer to the Union . 
Foreign ministries translated that idea into the Stability Pact , but finance ministers refused to finance it , so the pact remained an empty shell . 
Then the European Commission took the idea and translated it into bilateral Stability and Association Agreements , so the original idea - regional reconciliation - got lost . 
As a consequence , developments in the Balkans are unsatisfactory , as the recent riots in Kosovo and Serbia demonstrate . 
The Wider Europe Initiative also starts with a good idea : recognition that relations between the EU and its neighborhood are inherently asymmetric . 
The EU must promote democratic development in neighboring countries without expecting or demanding reciprocal concessions . 
It should , however , expect and demand progress and tailor its assistance to the performance of the countries concerned . 
Conditionality may not be the right word to describe the relationship , because it implies that certain conditions must be met before the Union bestows benefits . 
Today , however , the EU must take the initiative and offer incentives ; concessions could then be withdrawn if expectations are not fulfilled . 
This means that EU policy must be tailor-made for individual countries . 
It would be desirable to set up joint working groups with the countries concerned to establish , monitor , and adjust individual action plans . 
The European Commission is already engaged in preparing such plans . 
They need to be given greater substance . 
There is a fundamental difference between the EU &apos;s Eastern and Southern flanks . 
I am personally involved in the neighboring countries to the East , so I shall confine my remarks to that region . 
Wider Europe in the East happens to coincide with Russia &apos;s &quot; near abroad . &quot; 
While the EU cannot hold out the prospect of membership , Russia is happy to offer membership in a reconstituted empire . 
The EU must therefore offer inducements that outweigh pressure from Russia . 
Such inducements are not hard to find : greater access to Europe &apos;s common market , more favorable visa regimes , job and immigration opportunities , access to capital , cultural contacts , and technical assistance . 
Admittedly , the Union &apos;s budget does not have space for the Wider Europe Initiative before 2007 , but where there is a will there is a way . 
Giving substance to the initiative would offer an attractive alternative to the Bush administration &apos;s policy of spreading democracy by military means . 
I established Open Society Foundations in all the countries of the former Soviet Union . 
They do on a small scale what the Wider European Initiative ought to do on a large scale : promote democratic development by supporting civil society while working with governments when possible . 
The less receptive the government the more important supporting civil society becomes . 
The same principle ought to guide the EU . 
A civil society component must be included in every action plan . 
Individual action plans are urgently needed even before the general Wider Europe Initiative emerges . 
Elections are pending in Ukraine and Moldova , and abuses normally accompanying elections are on the increase . 
It ought to be possible to persuade governments in those countries to curb such behavior by holding out the prospect of substantial rewards . 
Georgia &apos;s peaceful revolution is not replicable elsewhere , but it has made neighboring regimes nervous . 
They ought to be persuaded - through a judicious mixture of carrots and sticks - that strengthening the rule of law and democratic institutions would work to their advantage . 
Georgia itself needs all the help it can get , which requires an emergency action plan different from the others . 
Belarus seems beyond redemption , but appearances are deceptive . 
Because President Alexander Lukashenka &apos;s behavior is so outrageous , a change of regime becomes possible . 
EU member states reacted strongly when Lukashenka tried to sack the rector of the prestigious European Humanities University , and this , along with other developments , weakened his position . 
Unfortunately , political conditions in Russia are moving the wrong way . 
After a chaotic period , Russia is shedding the few attributes of an open society it had acquired . 
Having failed to provide effective assistance , the West is no position to exert much political influence . 
The best way to encourage openness is by strengthening commercial and economic ties while ceasing to treat Russia as a nascent democracy . 
It is all the more important for the EU to take a more proactive role in the neighboring countries whose political orientation is not yet set in stone .
