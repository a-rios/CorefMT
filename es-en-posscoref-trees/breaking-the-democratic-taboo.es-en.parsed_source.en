Breaking the Democratic Taboo 
I am often invited by religious authorities in the Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia to attend meetings that are held to urge people to follow Islamic faith and law , while avoiding any debate connected to politics or political rights . 
Political rights , my hosts insist , are maintained by the ruling regimes themselves , and these follow the teachings of the Koran . 
But recently an invitation came from the Faisal Center for Islamic Research and Studies , which actually wanted me to talk about democracy , or &quot; good governance , &quot; as the participants called it . 
Until recently , this topic was taboo in Saudi Arabia , where the regime doesn &apos;t allow any margin for political debate , and commands people to listen , obey , and leave matters of government to their rulers . 
It was obvious that the conference organizers &quot; goal was to revive religious and political speech in order to find a middle ground between Islamic faith and democracy . 
I argued that , as many Islamic scholars have recognized , Islamic jurisprudence is compatible with democratic values . 
Every country that has chosen democracy has come closer to achieving Islam &apos;s goals of equality and social justice . 
Democracy suffers in the Islamic world due to skepticism about everything that comes from the West , especially the US . 
Thus , some leaders view democratization efforts as a new form of colonialism or imperialism in disguise . 
But the region &apos;s hesitancy to embrace democracy goes beyond mere fear of Western hegemony . 
There is a deep philosophical dispute about the nature of democracy . 
Some Islamic thinkers point to an inevitable contradiction between Islamic and democratic values . 
They argue that Islam requires submission to the will of God , while democracy implies submission to the will of people . 
This notion was clear in the writings of Said Kotb , who saw parliaments as preventing people from submitting to the rule of God . 
Yet Kotb &apos;s understanding contradicts with the established practices of the Prophet Mohammad , who created the first real state in the Arabian peninsula by declaring the constitution of Medina , which stated : &quot; Mohammad and the Jews of Bani-Aof &#91; who were citizens of Medina at that time &#93; are one nation . &quot; 
Thus , social relations were to be based on equality and justice , not religious beliefs . 
Indeed , the Prophet Mohammad &apos;s most important political truce , the Hodibiah Agreement between his rising nation and the leaders of Quraish ( the dominant tribe in Mecca at that time ) , stated clearly that &quot; everybody is free to join the league of Mohammad or the league of Quraish . &quot; 
Many non-Muslim tribes , like the Christians of Nagran , the Jews of Fadk , and the pagans of Khoza &apos;a , joined Mohammad &apos;s league and became part of the Islamic state . 
All Muslim and non-Muslim tribes had equal rights and freedoms , and enjoyed the protection of the state . 
Most importantly , Mecca was later opened to protect the pagan people of Khoza &apos;a against the attacks of Quraish . 
So it was not Mohammad &apos;s intent to build a theocratic or religious state under the rule of mullahs . 
He was establishing a democratic civil state where people were equal in rights and obligations . 
Reconciling the true understanding of Islam and democracy will , I believe , lead to a full realization of the richness of the Islamic experiment . 
It could also add great vitality to the democratic experiment by bringing it closer to the Muslim street . 
But the Islamic mainstream must first realize the importance of democratic reform , which is possible only by clearly understanding the Prophet &apos;s message , which promises genuine solutions for every time and place . 
Although the creation of study centers to debate the concept of Islamic democracy reflect the natural evolution of Islamic thinking , it will not go unopposed . 
Indeed , during one of the sessions I attended , Sheik Ahmad Rageh of Al-Imam University responded angrily to the Tunisian researcher Salah Edeen Al-Jorashi : &quot; How do you expect us to accept the freedom of faith in Islam ? 
It is something that exists only in your illusions . 
We believe in a religion that doesn &apos;t bargain with right , or hesitate in creed . 
We believe in a religion that orders us to kill the converts . 
There is no place in our nation for a malevolent or a renegade . &quot; 
I find it hard to understand how Sheik Rageh can miss ( or ignore ) the clear verses in the Koran , which order us to do the very opposite : 
&quot; Let there be no compulsion in religion &quot; ; 
&quot; Thou art not one to manage their affairs &quot; ; 
&quot; We have not sent thee to be disposer of their affairs for them &quot; ; and 
&quot; Say , &quot; The truth is from your Lord , &quot; let him who will , believe , and let him who will , reject . &quot; 
There are many other verses in the Koran that bear a message of tolerance and freedom . 
The mine of Islamic jurisprudence is very rich , but the problem is in the way its treasures are used . 
As the ancient Arabs used to say : &quot; A man &apos;s choice is a piece of his mind . &quot; 
The struggle in the Islamic world nowadays is a struggle for a piece of the Muslim mind .
