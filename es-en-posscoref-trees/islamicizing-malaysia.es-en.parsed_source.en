Islamicizing Malaysia 
Malaysian society is now gripped by a fundamental question : is the country , which is more than half Muslim , an Islamic state ? 
In practice , various religious and ethnic groups give Malaysia a distinctly multi-cultural character . 
But the Malaysian constitution provides room for arguments on both sides of the question , and the relatively secular status quo is facing a serious challenge . 
Drafted by a group of experts in 1957 , under the auspices of the country &apos;s former British rulers , the constitution includes two seemingly contradictory clauses . 
On the one hand , Article 3 states that Islam is the religion of the federation , and that only Islam can be preached to Muslims . 
On the other hand , Article 11 guarantees freedom of religion for all . 
As a result , Malaysia has developed both a general civil code , which is applied universally , and Islamic law , which is applied only to Muslims in personal and family matters . 
Recently , however , some Muslim groups have pressed the government to proclaim Malaysia an Islamic state , on the basis of Article 3 and the Muslims &quot; population majority . 
Ultimately , they would like Malaysia to be governed by Islamic law . 
For years , there was little need to resolve this constitutional issue . 
For example , if a Muslim decided to renounce his faith , the matter would be handled outside the legal system , or conversion records would be sealed . 
Today , however , every Malaysian must declare a religious affiliation , which is registered with the government - a requirement that has made it difficult for a Muslim to leave Islam without formalizing the change of status through the legal process . 
The country is now riveted on the fate of ordinary citizens like sales assistant Lina Joy and former religious teacher Kamariah Ali , who are trying to change their religious affiliation through the legal system . 
Muslim professional organizations and the Islamic opposition political party hold the view that renunciation of Islam is punishable by death . 
Likewise , the defense by Malaysian civil reform movements of individuals &quot; freedom of conscience has been denounced by some religious leaders as an attack on Islam . 
Currently , Malaysia has no law that would impose the death penalty on apostates . 
Yet public movements have been formed to highlight this Islamic tenet . 
If it is not applied , the argument goes , there will be a massive exodus of Muslims to other faiths . 
The immediate goal is to keep the courts from allowing Lina Joy or Kamariah Ali to convert . 
Attempts by other democratic civil society groups to debate this issue in peaceful public forums have been thwarted by threats of violence from a coalition of Muslim non-governmental organizations calling themselves BADAI ( the Malay acronym for Coalition against the Inter-Faith Commission ) . 
Concerned about sparking an ethnic clash , Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has proclaimed a ban on open discussion of these issues , threatening to arrest Internet news providers and activists if they continue to fan such debates . 
Badawi is right to be worried . 
Since independence , national politics in Malaysia has reinforced group identity , especially among ethnic Malays , an exclusively Muslim community . 
Identity politics allowed ethnic Malays to assert their claims to control over land , language , and religion . 
All attempts to reduce Malay influence serve to mobilize this community - in both ethnic and religious terms . 
Malay politicians have learned how to play this card very effectively . 
Ethnic Malays &quot; special status has long been codified in affirmative action policies giving them special economic benefits . 
However , as Malaysia engages with the global economy , these privileges may eventually be removed in order to heighten the country &apos;s competitiveness . 
As a result , many Malay-Muslims increasingly worry about the loss of familiar economic and political safeguards . 
In particular , tensions have grown between the Malay majority and the country &apos;s large Chinese minority , which has been quicker to benefit from Malaysia &apos;s economic opening to the world . 
Moreover , efforts to Islamicize the state comes at a time when conflict in the Middle East has further politicized Muslim movements in Malaysia . 
They view themselves as counter-forces to cultural domination by the West , asserting their religious identity in the face of what they regard as imperializing ideas like secularism and human rights . 
Small disputes are magnified by this underlying conflict . 
Disagreements are increasingly depicted as being rooted in an East-West divide , as a struggle between believers and apostates . 
Many Muslims are wary of this brand of identity politics . 
They recognize that the intolerance of Islamist groups can easily be turned against moderate Muslims . 
But all Malaysians must learn how to manage pressures that seem to be pushing their country &apos;s constituent communities away from one another . 
Defending a multi-cultural national identity in the face of religious intolerance is thus the great challenge facing Malaysia &apos;s state and society .
