Ten Reasons Why China is Different 
NEW HAVEN - The China doubters are back in force . 
They seem to come in waves - every few years , or so . 
Yet , year in and year out , China has defied the naysayers and stayed the course , perpetuating the most spectacular development miracle of modern times . 
That seems likely to continue . 
Today &apos;s feverish hand-wringing reflects a confluence of worries - especially concerns about inflation , excess investment , soaring wages , and bad bank loans . 
Prominent academics warn that China could fall victim to the dreaded &quot; middle-income trap , &quot; which has derailed many a developing nation . 
There is a kernel of truth to many of the concerns cited above , especially with respect to the current inflation problem . 
Here are ten reasons why it doesn &apos;t pay to diagnose the Chinese economy by drawing inferences from the experiences of others : 
Strategy . 
Since 1953 , China has framed its macro objectives in the context of five-year plans , with clearly defined targets and policy initiatives designed to hit those targets . 
The recently enacted 12th Five-Year Plan could well be a strategic turning point - ushering in a shift from the highly successful producer model of the past 30 years to a flourishing consumer society . 
Commitment . 
Seared by memories of turmoil , reinforced by the Cultural Revolution of the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s , China &apos;s leadership places the highest priority on stability . 
Such a commitment served China extremely well in avoiding collateral damage from the crisis of 2008-2009 . 
It stands to play an equally important role in driving the fight against inflation , asset bubbles , and deteriorating loan quality . 
Wherewithal to deliver . 
China &apos;s commitment to stability has teeth . 
More than 30 years of reform have unlocked its economic dynamism . 
Enterprise and financial-market reforms have been key , and many more reforms are coming . 
Moreover , China has shown itself to be a good learner from past crises , and shifts course when necessary . 
Saving . 
A domestic saving rate in excess of 50 % has served China well . 
It funded the investment imperatives of economic development and boosted the cushion of foreign-exchange reserves that has shielded China from external shocks . 
China now stands ready to absorb some of that surplus saving to promote a shift toward internal demand . 
Rural-urban migration . 
Over the past 30 years , the urban share of the Chinese population has risen from 20 % to 46 % . 
According to OECD estimates , another 316 million people should move from the countryside to China &apos;s cities over the next 20 years . 
Such an unprecedented wave of urbanization provides solid support for infrastructure investment and commercial and residential construction activity . 
Fears of excess investment and &quot; ghost cities &quot; fixate on the supply side , without giving due weight to burgeoning demand . 
Low-hanging fruit - Consumption . 
Private consumption accounts for only about 37 % of China &apos;s GDP - the smallest share of any major economy . 
By focusing on job creation , wage increases , and the social safety net , the 12th Five-Year Plan could spark a major increase in discretionary consumer purchasing power . 
Low-hanging fruit - Services . 
Services account for just 43 % of Chinese GDP - well below global norms . 
Services are an important piece of China &apos;s pro-consumption strategy - especially large-scale transactions-based industries such as distribution ( wholesale and retail ) , domestic transportation , supply-chain logistics , and hospitality and leisure . 
Over the next five years , the services share of Chinese GDP could rise above the currently targeted four-percentage-point increase . 
This is a labor-intensive , resource-efficient , environmentally-friendly growth recipe - precisely what China needs in the next phase of its development . 
Foreign direct investment . 
Modern China has long been a magnet for global multinational corporations seeking both efficiency and a toehold in the world &apos;s most populous market . 
Such investments provide China with access to modern technologies and management systems - a catalyst to economic development . 
China &apos;s upcoming pro-consumption rebalancing implies a potential shift in FDI - away from manufacturing toward services - that could propel growth further . 
Education . 
China has taken enormous strides in building human capital . 
The adult literacy rate is now almost 95 % , and secondary school enrollment rates are up to 80 % . 
Shanghai &apos;s 15-year-old students were recently ranked first globally in math and reading as per the standardized PISA metric . 
Chinese universities now graduate more than 1.5 million engineers and scientists annually . 
The country is well on its way to a knowledge-based economy . 
Innovation . 
In 2009 , about 280,000 domestic patent applications were filed in China , placing it third globally , behind Japan and the United States . 
China is fourth and rising in terms of international patent applications . 
At the same time , China is targeting a research-and-development share of GDP of 2.2 % by 2015 - double the ratio in 2002 . 
Currently , these seven industries account for 3 % of Chinese GDP ; the government is targeting a 15 % share by 2020 , a significant move up the value chain . 
Yale historian Jonathan Spence has long cautioned that the West tends to view China through the same lens as it sees itself . 
Today &apos;s cottage industry of China doubters is a case in point . 
Yes , by our standards , China &apos;s imbalances are unstable and unsustainable . 
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has , in fact , gone public with a similar critique . 
But that &apos;s why China is so different . 
It actually takes these concerns seriously . 
Unlike the West , where the very concept of strategy has become an oxymoron , China has embraced a transitional framework aimed at resolving its sustainability constraints . 
Moreover , unlike the West , which is trapped in a dysfunctional political quagmire , China has both the commitment and the wherewithal to deliver on that strategy . 
This is not a time to bet against China .
