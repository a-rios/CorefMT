Sharing the Burden of Hard Times 
PRINCETON - The economic gloom that shrouded the world in 2008 has led many to ask whether the apparent prosperity that preceded it was real . 
We know that in countries as diverse as China , India , Russia , and the United States , the number of billionaires soared . 
More generally , the top 1 % of the population prospered . 
No wonder that many are now skeptical about taxpayer-funded schemes to bail out banks , insurance companies , and even automakers . 
Is this just another case of politicians making sure that , even in hard times , the wealthy elite that supports them will once again do better than everyone else ? 
But , in assessing the benefits achieved by economic growth , it is a mistake to focus on whether the income gap between rich and poor widened or narrowed . 
If a person &apos;s annual income increased from $ 300 to $ 500 that may be enough to lift him out of extreme poverty , and will make a huge difference to his welfare and that of his family . 
If , at the same time , the income of a person earning a million dollars increased by $ 100,000 , the income gap will have widened . 
I believe that we shouldn &apos;t really be focusing on inequality anyway . 
We should give priority to reducing unnecessary suffering . 
If we take a worldwide perspective , it clearly did . 
In 1981 , about four in every ten people on the planet was living in the degrading condition that the World Bank terms extreme poverty . 
Now , it is less than one in four . 
Even in absolute terms , despite population growth , the number of extremely poor people fell during that period , from 1.9 billion to 1.4 billion . 
There have been especially dramatic reductions in poverty in countries like China and India . 
Does it matter so much that a few Chinese and Indians have become billionaires , if in the process hundreds of millions escaped extreme poverty ? 
But the prospects for a continuing reduction in world poverty in 2009 are not good . 
If the recession cuts deep in the developed nations , many workers will lose their jobs . 
Families that can no longer keep up with their mortgage payments will lose their homes . 
All of this causes real suffering . 
People become accustomed to a level of comfort , and hope to move up to something even better . 
When those expectations are disappointed , it is hard to accept having less than one had in the past . 
There may be a sense of shame , and a loss of self-esteem , at being poor , even in hard times . 
Nevertheless , the poor in industrialized nations will remain , in most cases , poor only by comparison with those who are better off . 
In the US , 97 % of those classified by the Census Bureau as poor own a color TV and a car . 
When Americans lose their jobs , even if they have no assets , they still have some access to health care and food stamps.ampnbsp ; 
The situation of the 1.4 billion people living in extreme poverty is different . 
They are poor by an absolute standard based on the most basic human needs . 
If the recession reduces demand for imports from developing nations , many people living in those countries will lose their jobs . 
They will have no social security to fall back on . 
They will struggle to feed their families . 
When a poor family &apos;s income drops , one of the few expenses on which it can cut back is the cost of sending the children to school . 
The most basic health care services will usually be beyond their means . 
This will be where the recession hits hardest . 
Some will see globalization as the cause of this hardship , for if the poor were not linked to the rich through trade , they would not be affected by the recession . 
True , but they would also have missed out on the growth that helped so many of them to escape poverty . 
It &apos;s difficult to see self-sufficiency providing an adequate standard of living for the world &apos;s growing population . 
In this dire situation , what will the rich countries do ? 
They have , on several occasions , pledged to increase their aid to the poor , and some European countries have started to meet their higher targets . 
US President-elect Barack Obama said , prior to his election , that he would double America &apos;s foreign aid , and make it more effective in helping the poor . 
It is understandable why , in the midst of an election campaign , a candidate would say that , for , even in the best of times , increasing foreign aid wins few votes in America . 
Doubling US foreign aid would , however , still leave it below $ 50 billion a year - a modest sum compared to the $ 685 billion that the US spent on defense in 2008 . 
I doubt that any $ 50 billion in the Pentagon &apos;s budget could do more to make the world safer than doubling aid to the world &apos;s poorest people . 
It is not a step that should await the return of prosperity .
