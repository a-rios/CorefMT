Shifting the Afghan &quot; Great Game &quot; 
Tel Aviv - So President Barack Obama has decided to &quot; stay the course . &quot; 
The obstinate battle cry of the Bush administration in Iraq has now won out in Obama &apos;s planned surge of an additional 30,000 troops in Afghanistan . 
A Taliban victory there , the advocates of the surge had warned , would radicalize the entire region and create a domino effect , with Islamic insurgencies unleashed across Central Asia . 
Al Qaeda , inextricably entwined with the Taliban , would also claim victory if America had signaled a retreat . 
But victory for the forces of jihad is not the only possible scenario . 
Al Qaeda , for example , has now become a franchised global concern whose capabilities no longer depend on its Afghan base . 
In fact , disconnected from the heroin trade , which has turned the Taliban into a colossal economic concern , Al Qaeda is in clear financial decline . 
Nor is it clear that NATO &apos;s withdrawal would inevitably usher in a Taliban takeover . 
A fragmentation of the country along ethnic lines is a more probable scenario . 
In reality , the question of what to do in Afghanistan concerns the old vocation of the &quot; white man &apos;s burden , &quot; which never seems to die , however costly and duplicitous it might be . 
None of these countries is considering a military solution to the Afghan crisis . 
Pakistan &apos;s macabre association with the Taliban stems mostly from its constant effort to pressure its mortal enemy , India . 
A stable and secular Afghanistan is therefore a vital strategic necessity for India . 
Indeed , India was alone in the non-aligned movement in supporting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980 &quot; s , and it also desperately supported the secular Northern Alliance after the Taliban victory of the 1990 &quot; s . 
Nor can China &apos;s interest in the stability of both Afghanistan and Pakistan be underestimated . 
Afghanistan , along with Pakistan and Iran , is part of a vital western security zone for China . 
It is a corridor through which it can secure its interests in Pakistan , a traditional ally , and ensure its access to vital natural resources in the region . 
Moreover , China &apos;s Muslim-majority province of Xinjiang , bordering on Afghanistan , can be dangerously affected by a Taliban takeover in Kabul or by the dismemberment of the country . 
Russia , of course , has no appetite to repeat the Soviet Union &apos;s calamitous military adventure in Afghanistan . 
The Russians are especially concerned by the regularly involvement of jihadis from Chechnya , Dagestan , and Central Asia with Taliban fighters . 
So , while the US gets to play the &quot; Ugly American &quot; once again , the regional powers promote their interests in that war-torn country with a smiling face and away from the battlefield . 
America &apos;s difficulties in Afghanistan - and the serious problems it faces in harnessing Pakistan &apos;s government to a more robust fight against the Taliban both at home and in Afghanistan - provide an opportunity for these powers to attempt to shift the dynamics of the &quot; Great Game &quot; to their benefit . 
Soft power is their means . 
Afghanistan is the recipient of the largest assistance program that India has for any country in the world . 
That program focuses on the Afghanization of the development process , as well as on allowing the security forces to operate autonomously . 
As in Africa , where it is consistently replacing Western influence with its massive financial firepower , China &apos;s strategy in Afghanistan is mostly focused on business development - with a stabilizing effect on the country that should not be underestimated . 
China &apos;s development of the Ainak Copper Mine is the largest single foreign direct investment in Afghanistan &apos;s history . 
China is also engaged in constructing a $ 500 million electric plant and railway link between Tajikistan and Pakistan . 
Russia &apos;s economic influence in Afghanistan is far less robust , but it is growing . 
While the West is busy fighting the Taliban , the Russians , like the other regional powers , are building roads and electricity stations , and conceiving regional diplomatic solutions to what has become a Vietnam-like quagmire for the West . 
If both war and diplomacy fail , these regional powers believe they will be better positioned than the West to shift the Afghan Great Game in their favor . 
China &apos;s diplomatic recipe for Afghanistan and Pakistan is the right one , and the US should focus on it . 
A settlement over Kashmir is the key to stability in Afghanistan , which would then no longer be a strategic playground for India and Pakistan . 
Instead of persisting in a counterproductive war effort , the US should use its leverage on India and Pakistan to bring them back to peace negotiations . 
Beyond the additional troops , President Obama must strive for an inclusive settlement in Afghanistan . 
This means engaging Afghanistan &apos;s neighboring states to promote a settlement of national reconciliation that includes all the major stakeholders  -  the government , the Taliban and the warlords  -  in the country .
