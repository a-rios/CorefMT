China \ u0027s Anti-Secession Law Boomerangs 
The passage of any law by China &apos;s rubber-stamp National People &apos;s Congress is always a mere formality . 
It raised the stakes for the island &apos;s pro-independence camp and increased the risk of a cross-Strait military conflict . 
The anti-secession law &apos;s vague language and attempt at softened wording - perhaps geared toward mollifying foreign critics - paradoxically increases rather than decreases the likelihood that China and the United States could be unwittingly and unwillingly drawn into an avoidable military conflict . 
By failing to clearly delineate presumed or potential &quot; red lines &quot; for Taiwan , the law leaves open the possibility of substantial miscalculation or misinterpretation . 
Despite several weeks of intense US pressure to soften - or even retract - the proposed law , China &apos;s leaders did little more than attempt to reinforce their position that &quot; non-peaceful &quot; ( i.e. , military ) measures would serve strictly as a last resort - which had already been assumed anyway . 
The Bush administration &apos;s reaction was uncharacteristically blunt , with its call for &quot; Beijing to reconsider the passage of the law &apos; &quot; - a rather directly worded intrusion into what China considers to be an internal matter . 
Taiwan &apos;s December 2004 legislative elections had delivered an unexpected defeat for Chen and his ruling Democratic Progressive Party , or DPP , and the pro-independence camp &apos;s failure to secure a legislative majority was seen as a positive development for relations with the mainland . 
Indeed , the start of 2005 saw some movement on improved ties , with the introduction of a hugely successful lunar new year charter-flights program . 
Now , in the aftermath of the anti-secession law , the future of the charter-flights scheme looks bleak . 
Opinion polls in Taiwan reflect public dismay over the Chinese legislation , and this negative sentiment will raise the pressure on President Chen , who recently antagonized some of his more ardent pro-independence supporters by reaching out to the pro-unification opposition People First Party . 
A survey by Taiwan &apos;s China Times found that 56 % of those polled resented the anti-secession law , with 47 % saying that Taiwan should retaliate by either holding a public referendum on the issue or introducing counter-legislation of its own . 
There are now serious concerns that the so-called dark greens - the harder-line faction in Taiwan &apos;s pro-independence pan-green political camp - will seize this issue as a stick with which to beat President Chen . 
As DPP legislator Hsiao Bi-khim recently said , the anti-secession law &quot; will make it very hard for us to be moderates . &quot; 
One of the more frustrating elements of the anti-secession law is the fact that it is an entirely unnecessary provocation . 
The absence of laws mandating force to block separatist activity has never stopped Chinese authorities from brutally persecuting individuals and groups who have called for an independent Tibet or Xinjiang . 
There is thus little reason to believe that a more explicitly assertive stance is necessary for dealing with the &quot; splittist &quot; government in Taipei . 
Missile tests , PLA military exercises and threatening rhetoric have been sufficient deterrents until now . 
Mainland officials justify the law in terms of clarifying their policy and establishing a legal premise for invading the island . 
In practice , however , the construction of legal foundations could weaken the Chinese government &apos;s operational flexibility when responding to a Taiwanese move toward independence . 
The law of unintended consequences dictates that this effort to deny ambiguity to Taiwanese activists could backfire , and instead leave mainland leaders without room to maneuver if Taiwan does attempt to revise the status quo . 
This means that the Hu Jintao administration could well have its hands tied , and find itself unable to pursue some kind of compromise solution to a situation that is already fraught with nuance and complexity , and which shows no sign of getting easier to manage with the passage of time . 
While outright military conflict is still considered unlikely , the combination of China &apos;s vague &quot; red lines &quot; and non-specific threats will certainly raise the likelihood of miscalculation and misinterpretation on both sides . 
More broadly , the fact that the anti-secession law was introduced at all comes as a major disappointment to those who had been impressed by the apparent sophistication and skillfulness of recent Chinese diplomacy . 
Coming in the same week as China &apos;s poorly handled removal of Tung Chee-hwa as Hong Kong &apos;s Chief Executive , the anti-secession law episode illustrates that the mainland &apos;s PR savvy has its limits and that Taiwan will remain an emotional and divisive thorn in the side of Sino-US relations .
