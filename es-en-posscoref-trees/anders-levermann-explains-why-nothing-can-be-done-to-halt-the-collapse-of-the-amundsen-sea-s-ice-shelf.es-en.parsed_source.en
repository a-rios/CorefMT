Antarctica &apos;s Point of No Return 
POTSDAM - Recent satellite observations have confirmed the accuracy of two independent computer simulations that show that the West Antarctic ice sheet has now entered a state of unstoppable collapse . 
The planet has entered a new era of irreversible consequences from climate change . 
The only question now is whether we will do enough to prevent similar developments elsewhere . 
What the latest findings demonstrate is that crucial parts of the world &apos;s climate system , though massive in size , are so fragile that they can be irremediably disrupted by human activity . 
It is inevitable that the warmer the world gets , the greater the risk that other parts of the Antarctic will reach a similar tipping point ; in fact , we now know that the Wilkes Basin in East Antarctica , as big or even bigger than the ice sheet in the West , could be similarly vulnerable . 
There are not many human activities whose impact can reasonably be predicted decades , centuries , or even millennia in advance . 
The fallout from nuclear waste is one ; humans &quot; contribution to global warming through greenhouse-gas emissions from burning fossil fuels , and its impact on rising sea levels , is another . 
Indeed , the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report stated , in uncharacteristically strong terms , that the sea level is &quot; virtually certain &quot; to continue to rise in the coming centuries or millennia . 
Moreover , the greater our emissions , the higher the seas will rise . 
But the recent revelations about Antarctica are different . 
Rather than reacting to global warming with gradual and predictable patterns of change , the West Antarctic ice sheet has suddenly &quot; tipped &quot; into a new state . 
A relatively small amount of melting beneath the Amundsen Sea &apos;s ice shelf has pushed its grounding line to the top of a sub-glacial hill , from which it is now &quot; rolling down . &quot; 
Simply put , one thermal kick was enough to initiate an internal dynamic that will now continue under its own momentum , regardless of any action that humans might take to prevent it . 
It is not completely clear whether humans have caused this tipping - though nothing like it has ever occurred during the 11,500-year Holocene period before humans started interfering with the planet &apos;s energy balance . 
What is important is that we recognize the existence of gigantic parts of the earth &apos;s climate system - such as West Antarctica &apos;s three-quadrillion-ton ice sheet - that can be tipped when a fractional temperature rise occurs in key locations . 
This risk is no longer merely theoretical . 
For the first time , findings based on observations and computer simulations all point to the same conclusion : the huge Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica has begun an irreversible ice discharge , and nothing can now halt the subsequent drainage of the entire basin . 
It has passed the point of no return . 
If an &quot; ice plug &quot; near the coast of Wilkes Basin melts or breaks off into icebergs , the basin &apos;s huge quantities of water will drain into the ocean . 
Although no one knows precisely what might destabilize the Wilkes Basin , we can be fairly certain that further global warming , caused by greenhouse-gas emissions , will increase the risk . 
The fact that sea levels will continue to rise is now clear . 
Climate change is caused by mankind , so the good news is that mankind can stop it by cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Although West Antarctica &apos;s fate is sealed , we may still be able to prevent the collapse of East Antarctica &apos;s marine ice sheet . 
The current path risks further destabilization in Antarctica ; choosing the alternative path of a new energy system for the planet is our last best hope .
