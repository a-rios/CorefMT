Whither the Egyptian Revolution ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - Egypt &apos;s revolution toppled a dictator in February , but the country &apos;s future as a stable , functioning democracy remains uncertain . 
The West is , of course , limited in its ability to shape the transition process . 
Nonetheless , the potential for constructive influence remains considerable , and it should be responsive to those in Egypt who favor liberal ideas , democratic institutions , and broad distribution of the benefits of economic development . 
The upcoming parliamentary elections are but an early stage in a long ( perhaps decades-long ) struggle to define the new Egypt . 
Will Egypt gravitate toward Islamic theocracy or adopt a secular government that respects minority rights ? 
Which economic policies - statist , liberal , or some combination of the two - will best ensure social justice and broad distribution of prosperity ? 
Can civilian control of the military be established ? 
Will the regional security structure formed around the United States , Egypt , and Israel survive ? 
The November elections will not resolve these fundamental questions , and whether a workable constitutional framework will develop is uncertain . 
A parliamentary system of government will likely emerge , including a prime minister and a cabinet , with the strong possibility that the presidency will be politically overshadowed , particularly if the presidential election is delayed . 
The central unknown is the composition of the ruling coalition . 
It appears unlikely that a single party will emerge from the election with enough parliamentary seats to govern on its own . 
So a coalition government will be necessary . 
The political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood ( the Freedom and Justice Party ) currently is the best-organized party , and may be in the strongest position to form a majority coalition , including Salafist elements . 
By contrast , secular liberal parties have yet to develop effective organizations or project compelling visions for the future . 
Although sentiment favoring a secular state is considerable , a coalition that can serve as an alternative or counterweight to the Muslim Brotherhood will be difficult to assemble . 
In the near term , the most likely counterweight could be a liberal coalition with a heavy component of former members of deposed President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s National Democratic Party ( NDP ) - that is , those who have not been discredited by their association with Mubarak . 
Election rules favor those who were organized before the revolution . 
Approximately one-third of the new parliament will comprise &quot; non-party list &quot; candidates . 
Established networks based on family , local loyalties , and tribal affiliations will be key determinants in voting . These circumstances may favor &quot; non-party list &quot; candidates associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and the former NDP , particularly in rural Egypt . 
Post-election shifts in the composition of coalitions could complicate the situation , making governance even more difficult . 
Power-sharing among coalition partners will be an intricate affair , including behind-the-scenes deals with the military , which will insist on measures to safeguard its interests . 
The political atmosphere in Egypt remains volatile . 
Expectations of economic improvement are extremely high . 
The initial elected government may pay an early political price for failure . 
The starting point for the West in trying to assist Egypt &apos;s transition must be recognition that patient , long-term engagement will be required . 
The effectiveness of this engagement will depend primarily on the persuasiveness of the West &apos;s policy prescriptions , rather than on the volume of financial assistance . 
G-8 countries have already pledged support to post-Mubarak Egypt , including economic aid , debt relief , and loan guarantees . 
These steps are important , though delivery will be prolonged and the likely impact modest , at least in the near-term . 
Egypt has already declined support from the International Monetary Fund . 
But , apart from an IMF-backed reform program , if the Egyptian government &apos;s policy framework is right , resources will flow from the private sector , including foreign investment supportive of job creation and economic development . 
This is the message that Egypt needs to grasp and embrace . 
G-8 governments should urgently and repeatedly undertake quiet , structured , and consistent communications with Egyptian counterparts about the economic reforms needed to bring about prosperity . 
It is far too early to judge the strength of internal forces promoting liberal economic policies . 
The need for economic growth could intrinsically push policymakers toward market-oriented economic policies ( sensitive to considerations of &quot; social justice &quot; ) and an open investment environment . 
Powerful forces within the Egyptian business community are silent at the moment , but in time will reassert themselves . 
Many business interests with job-creating capacity want the continuation of market-oriented reforms begun a decade ago ( which produced impressive growth rates ) , but support broadening prosperity and rooting out corruption . 
Moreover , an independent media might tend to reinforce pro-market and democratic sentiment . 
Indeed , Western governments should continue to use their channels to the Egyptian military and future civil leadership to encourage them to uphold the rule of law , to act with restraint , and to respect free expression . 
Finally , countries supportive of a democratic Egypt should focus on encouraging the institutional and social underpinnings of democratic process and market reform . 
Winning broad public support will take time . 
Private non-profit organizations and private enterprise , rather than governments directly , are best equipped to provide this type of training and expertise for leadership development and capacity building . 
The job of democratic governments is to provide the resources that can make delivery of this aid possible .
