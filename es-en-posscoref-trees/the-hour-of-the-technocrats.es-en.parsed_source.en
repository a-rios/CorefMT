The Hour of the Technocrats 
CAMBRIDGE - Greece and Italy , desperate after their gridlocked political systems left them mired in debt and crisis , have both chosen technocratic economists - Lucas Papademos and Mario Monti , respectively - rather than politicians to lead new governments . 
Both can be described as professors : Monti has been president of Milan &apos;s Bocconi University as well as a European Commissioner , and Papademos has been my colleague at Harvard &apos;s Kennedy School of Government in the year since he finished his term as Deputy Governor of the European Central Bank . 
Not long from now , both men will most likely provoke headlines such as the following : &quot; Professors Earn &quot; A &quot; in Economics , but Flunk Politics . &quot; 
That will be unfair . 
It is not a lack of political ability which will stymie them , but rather a lack of political power . 
Monti , despite strong popular support for his technocratic government , does not have a parliamentary majority upon which he can rely . 
Meanwhile , former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has made it clear that he will not set aside his personal political interests for the good of the country . 
Papademos has been dealt an even weaker hand . 
Despite his best efforts to insist on a term longer than three months and the ability to appoint some members of his cabinet as conditions for accepting the premiership , in the end he won neither demand . 
The elevation of these two outstanding civil servants comes after a period when other professors have been squeezed out by the political process . 
In June , several well-qualified economists from emerging-market countries were passed over in the selection of a successor to Dominique Strauss-Kahn as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund . 
In Germany , Axel Weber resigned as President of the Bundesbank and member of the Governing Council of the ECB last January , reportedly because his statements opposing the Banks &quot; purchases of troubled eurozone countries &quot; bonds reflected his political naivety . 
The press could not imagine that a technocrat might voluntarily relinquish a sure shot at a position of great power - successor to Jean-Claude Trichet as ECB President - on a matter of principle . 
But that is precisely what Weber did . 
The willingness to give up power if necessary is one of the advantages that professors bring to such positions . 
( The ECB presidency then went to another economist and technocrat , Mario Draghi , who is , in fact , the perfect man for the job . ) 
It is a mistake to conflate technocratic elites ( those with PhDs or other advanced economics degrees ) with other kinds of elites ( those with money or power , especially if they inherited one or the other ) . 
Most economists understood the downside risks of European monetary union . 
It was the politicians who underestimated the technical difficulties when they opted for monetary integration . 
It goes without saying that academic or technical expertise is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure government officials &quot; success . 
Indeed , many of my Harvard colleagues would make terrible policymakers , owing to a lack of leadership , managerial , or other interpersonal skills . 
And many excellent political leaders - for example , George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower , among US presidents - have not been intellectuals . 
Technocrats can play a useful role as honest brokers when traditional politicians have become discredited or parties are deadlocked . 
Moreover , they have the credibility that comes with a lack of desire to be re-elected , either because their term in office has been limited in advance or because they are known to prefer a quiet academic life . 
Their most obvious advantage is apparent when a country faces problems - for example , proposing economic reforms or negotiating loan terms - that are largely technical . 
A good precedent in Italy is Carlo Ciampi , who took the reins of government in 1993 , after Italy was forced to drop out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism , and managed to repeal the scala mobile ( the wage-indexation system ) , beat down inflation , and re-board the train of European monetary integration . 
Among some technocrats &quot; obvious disadvantages are lack of managerial experience , lack of perceived legitimacy , and lack of a domestic power base . 
Monti and Papademos both have managerial experience and , for now , legitimacy . 
They will be limited , however , by their inability to command the stable support of a political bloc . 
Several current heads of state could be considered technocrats : President Felipe Calder칩nof Mexico , President Sebasti치n Pi침era of Chile , and President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia , among others . 
Nobody could accuse them of having led sheltered lives , or of being unaccustomed to making difficult decisions . 
At the same time , all three received academic training at Harvard . 
( Calder칩ntook three courses from me ; unfortunately , dealing with violent drug lords was not on my syllabus . ) 
Having good international credentials is not always an advantage . 
When Sirleaf received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 , there was speculation that her good image abroad could hurt her campaign for re-election at home . 
Analogously , both Papademos and Monti are certified European Union and eurozone elites , which will help them to obtain support for their countries abroad , but will leave them vulnerable to domestic charges that they are lackeys of foreign powers . 
It is fitting that Rome and Athens , the two seats of classical Western civilization , have turned to these two urbane , erudite men for leadership . 
But neither Papademos nor Monti can work any technocratic magic if they are not given the political tools to get the right policies enacted .
