The Reconstruction of European Politics 
PRINCETON - Many Europeans tremble at the likely outcome of the upcoming European Parliament election : a strong showing for anti-European protest parties , which will almost certainly try to present themselves as the real winners . 
But hand-wringing will not resolve the European Union &apos;s political crisis . 
And the crisis runs deep . 
Nowadays , anti-EU parties - Marine Le Pen &apos;s National Front in France , Geert Wilders &quot; Party for Freedom in the Netherlands , and Nigel Farage &apos;s United Kingdom Independence Party - have been the most effective at organizing themselves into a single political &quot; family . &quot; 
Meanwhile , the established families - social democrats , liberals , and the European People &apos;s Party ( EPP ) bloc - have been discredited in many Europeans &quot; eyes . 
The problem is that the old European parties &quot; intellectual and moral foundations have rapidly eroded in recent years , owing partly to their failure - or inability - to adapt to EU-level systems . 
If they do not act fast to re-establish themselves as credible and effective representatives of voters &quot; interests , they risk fading into the political background , allowing irresponsible populists gradually to take center stage . 
Consider the social democrats , whose mission has historically been to facilitate the redistribution of resources . 
Given that such redistribution in Europe occurs fundamentally at the level of individual countries - which have the needed fiscal authority - it is difficult to view it as a suitable project for Europe as a whole . 
Indeed , it may be impossible to Europeanize social democracy under current conditions . 
The more deeply integrated Europe becomes , the less capacity national governments have for redistribution , because individuals , companies , and jobs can simply leave countries with higher tax rates , as has already happened in countries like France . 
And an EU-level social-welfare state funded through taxes on corporate or personal income would require large transfers among countries , exacerbating already-high tensions among EU member states . 
Economic liberals &quot; capacity to appeal to a broad electorate has also suffered . 
In the wake of the global economic crisis , voters have demanded government intervention , suggesting that many have lost confidence in the lightly regulated systems of the past . 
Finally , there are the EPP &apos;s center-right Christian Democratic forces , which emerged in the immediate post-World War II period with a religion-based emphasis on social solidarity that provided an alternative to the inhumane collectivism of fascism and communism . 
Since then , however , Western Europe has secularized considerably , and the notion of basing political decisions on Catholic social teaching now strikes voters as quaint . 
As a result , the center-right parties appear intellectually thin - do-nothing parties that resist change and offer no new ideas . 
As it stands , the anti-EU parties &quot; enthusiastic embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin , with his profoundly anti-liberal economic and social policies , may well be the only thing working in the established political families &quot; favor . 
But it does not have to remain this way . 
With a new political vision shaped by current trends and imperatives , Europe can create an effective political system fit for the twenty-first century . 
Such a vision , like all of Europe &apos;s most effective conceptions , would be a blend of French and German ideas . 
France is currently gripped by the massive success of economist Thomas Piketty &apos;s book Capital in the Twenty-First Century , which analyzes how inequality rises in the absence of exceptional levels of economic growth . 
The book &apos;s message - a call to address rising inequality and a plea for stronger economic growth - has strong policy implications . 
But Pikettism does not require income taxes , so much as wealth taxes . 
The idea of using a wealth tax to overcome Europe &apos;s debt crisis also has considerable support on the eastern side of the Rhine River , but for different reasons . 
Germans remain worried that they will be called upon to bail out the over-indebted governments of southern Europe . 
Such a transfer of public debt would be unfair , Germany contends - not least because high levels of public debt are often accompanied by higher levels of household wealth than in northern Europe . 
This argument , made by the Bundesbank , seems to support a wealth tax . 
In fact , a wealth tax could spark economic activity and growth . 
Empty houses and uncultivated fields - a common feature of southern Europe - represent a relatively secure investment that does not cost much , owing to low property taxes . 
A higher tax rate would spur owners to sell , leading to the restoration and improvement of land and buildings - effectively acting as a large stimulus package . 
Given that a wealth tax would be used primarily to pay down high levels of existing public debt , it would be applied in the context of the individual member states . 
Its basis in real estate means that it would not depend on a precarious attempt to tax a mobile factor of production . 
And presenting the tax as a one-off levy to address the legacy of bad policy in the twentieth century would ensure that it did not deter future economic activity . 
The upcoming European Parliament election could be the wake-up call that pro-EU parties so desperately need . 
Fortunately for them , there is a compelling way to combine the fundamentally French concern about the dangers of inequality with the fundamentally German concern about excessive public debt . 
That is why property and wealth taxes are likely to become the foundation of a new political alignment in Europe .
