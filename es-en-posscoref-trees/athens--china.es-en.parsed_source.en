BEIJING - While parts of the world are dealing with the aftermath of the financial crisis or an emerging sovereign-debt crisis , China is coping with the risk of overheating and / or an asset bubble . 
Many factors may be pushing China &apos;s economy in this direction . 
One of the most worrying is the same which fueled the current crisis in the eurozone : mushrooming public debt . 
In the eurozone , the problem is member countries &quot; sovereign debt ; in China , the problem is borrowing linked to local governments . 
In the eurozone , a bloated social-welfare system , particularly for the rapidly growing population of retirees , and the economic slowdown caused by the financial crisis are key components of the structural debt problem . 
In China , local officials increased borrowing in order to ensure that their regions &quot; economic growth rates remain at double-digit levels . 
There are , no surprise , commonalities between China and the eurozone . 
Obviously , debt accumulates wherever people want to spend more than they have saved . 
Because these funds are not issued or controlled by any member country or local government , eurozone members and Chinese local governments cannot relieve their debt problems through devaluation . 
So , in both cases , when a debt is defaulted upon or loans become non-performing , the negative consequences are felt by the entire financial and monetary &quot; zone &quot; - the entire EU and all of China . 
To avoid such an internal &quot; sovereign debt crisis , &quot; China &apos;s Budget Law , adopted in 1994 , forbade local governments from borrowing autonomously , either by issuing bonds to the public or by getting credits from banks . 
In theory , this means that local governments cannot finance their deficits by increasing their debt levels , because they can borrow only from the central government or other central authorities . 
But the Budget Law did not end the problem . 
While local governments have been unable to borrow , locally controlled state-investment companies can . 
So it is no surprise that a huge volume of bank loans has passed through the local branches of state-owned banks to finance local public-investment projects . 
These borrowings caused a surge in non-performing bank loans in the early and mid-1990 &quot; s , when total non-performing loans hit 40 % of GDP . 
Due to privatization of state-owned enterprises and improved financial regulation , including bank supervision and risk control , since 2000 both central and local budgets have basically been in good order . 
The ratio of total public debt to GDP was less than 22 % in 2007-2008 , before the global financial crisis . 
There was still some borrowing by local governments , of course , but on a limited scale ( totaling 3-4 % of GDP ) , owing to institutionalized surveillance of lending . 
Then came the financial crisis , with the central government adopting fiscal stimulus and relaxing monetary policy . 
Local governments were encouraged to increase their spending on public infrastructure projects in order to maintain growth . 
As a result , the volume of bank credits financing local investments increased six-fold in 2009 alone . 
Indeed , total borrowing by local government now amounts to roughly $ 900 billion , up from $ 150 billion year on year and the equivalent of almost 20 % of GDP . 
This level of borrowing poses a new type of financial risk for China . 
I believe that it remains manageable . 
Some local borrowing can be justified by the central budgetary allocation to local projects . 
Moreover , some local spending took place in regions that will continue to enjoy high growth in tax revenues for the foreseeable future , thus ensuring that the debts will be serviced . 
Perhaps only one-third of the total volume of loans is problematic ; the rest may or will continue to perform . 
The most important change that may keep the problem manageable is that China &apos;s monetary authorities have been putting the brake on the growth of these debts since late last year . 
In general , local borrowing windows are closed , and inspections are underway to gain an accurate picture of the situation . 
With economic growth continuing , the potential risk posed by this debt will diminish . 
Chinese officials are drawing lessons from this heavy debt burden , as they fear the prospect of local governments creating an internal &quot; Greek crisis &quot; for the rest of China . 
The authorities recognize the need for strict fiscal discipline and financial regulation . 
The leverage of any public entity must be monitored , supervised , and restricted . 
Of course , Chinese local governments have never had total financial or fiscal autonomy . 
Indeed , ever since the Qin Dynasty united the country and established a centralized regime some 2,000 years ago , accountability for debt has been treated as a central government problem . 
Those who advocate fiscal decentralization and deregulation in China should think about establishing real local fiscal accountability first . 
China &apos;s current legal framework contributed to fiscal balance and financial stability in the past , and it continues to play a positive role . 
Otherwise , China might already have experienced its own localized &quot; sovereign debt &quot; crisis and , perhaps , hyper-inflation . 
For example , they try to squeeze as much as possible out of land sales , thereby pushing up housing prices and helping to inflate asset bubbles . 
Given the negative consequences of this approach , it might be wise for the central government to consider establishing , for the short-run , quotas or ceilings for total local government borrowing .
