The Three Faces of Putin 
MOSCOW : Being president of Russia is often caricatured as being like a tsar , but the powers of President Vladimir Putin are more constrained than the Kremlin &apos;s former autocrats and Politburo chieftains . 
An obvious sign of this is the amount of time Putin spends on foreign trips with little diplomatic justification . 
Diplomacy , however , allows a president opportunity to enhance his authority for future domestic battles . 
The constraints Putin faces are not constitutional but are formed by the three factions that make up his government . 
One is a group of FSB ( the successor agency to the KGB ) men from St. Petersburg , headed by Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov . 
The second consists of liberal economists and lawyers from Putin &apos;s home town of St. Petersburg , with Minister of Finance Alexei Kudrin and Minister of Economy German Gref the leading lights . 
The third faction is an &quot; oligarchic &quot; business-oriented group led by Putin &apos;s chief of staff Alexander Voloshin , Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and the secretive oil and aluminum tycoon Roman Abramovich , perhaps Russia &apos;s richest man at age 33 . 
Because of these three very visible fault lines , some Russians describe their country as having distinct security , economic , and political / business governments . 
The FSB people naturally focus on security , law , and order . 
But , as under Yeltsin , it is the oligarchic faction that dominates , for it controls the Presidential Administration , the Council of Ministers , two centrist parliamentary factions , and much of Russia &apos;s oil , aluminum , railways and nuclear industries . 
So far , Putin has compromised with the oligarchic force , which has reduced his personal imprint on policies . 
It is too powerful and skillful to be challenged head-on . 
Kremlin policymaking is largely an interplay between these three factions . 
The institutional checks and balances built into Russia &apos;s constitution have been neutralized . 
Rampant corruption has discredited regional governors as a counterweight . 
Indeed , the financial crash of August 1998 was provoked in large measure by governors issuing big subsidies to friendly local enterprises and demanding kick-backs in return . 
By slashing subsidies from regional budgets , federal revenues increased from 9 % of GDP in 1998 to 17 % of GDP this year . 
Not a surprise , then , that the governors cannot mobilize popular support as federal authorities impose accountability standards on them . 
The State Duma has also faded . 
Under Yeltsin , deputies &quot; votes were routinely purchased ; now the Kremlin &apos;s FSB faction pressures deputies by reminding them of their past bribe-taking . 
Parliamentarians complain about &quot; KGB threats , &quot; but honesty doesn &apos;t seem a lot to ask of Duma members . 
The real problem in policymaking is forging agreement between Putin &apos;s three factions . 
Take the example of the Kursk disaster . 
The politics of the sunken submarine were handled by Sergei Ivanov . 
The other factions thought that he deserved the hostile criticism that followed in the wake of the Kremlin &apos;s bumbles , and the liberals hoped that this debacle would reinforce independent media . 
As no faction embraces the military , an expected rise in defense expenditures has been insignificant ; indeed , Putin is slashing 600,000 men from Russia &apos;s military . 
All three factions applaud the downfalls of media oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky , but for different reasons . 
The FSB favors keeping the media under the Kremlin &apos;s thumb . 
Abramovich , brought to the fore by Berezovsky , is eliminating his competitors . 
Liberals see Berezovsky and Gusinsky as the main practitioners of corruption and responsible for the demise of market reform in 1997 . 
Thus , the outstanding issue is media freedom , with the FSB faction and the liberals opposing one another . 
Neither the FSB people nor the oligarchs focus on economic policy beyond their immediate interests , abandoning that field to the liberals , who radically reformed taxes , cleaned up the state budget , and monetized the economy by curbing barter . 
Pension reform with private savings accounts and land reform leading to private ownership of land seem within reach . 
Prospects for economic reform have never been brighter than in 2000 . 
The main problem is producing well-designed reforms backed by key officials . 
Here a big problem arises from the fact that industrial ministers continue to interfere because they represent business interests or are even in business themselves . 
Last September , Minister of Communications Leonid Reiman , a key member of the St. Petersburg FSB group , deprived two leading Russian mobile phone companies of their frequencies so as to benefit a company favored by him . 
Fortunately , his decision was reversed by the government after public uproar . 
In the coming year , Putin &apos;s big test will be over control of gas monopoly Gazprom , now co-owned by its managers and the state . 
Its long-time CEO Rem Vyakhirev departs next May . 
Incredibly , Russia &apos;s largest company - with one third of the world &apos;s gas reserves - is unprofitable because of poor management and theft . 
Billions of dollars are siphoned off each year through companies allegedly controlled by Gazprom managers . 
Clearly , Putin wants to end this robbery of state assets , and minority shareholders are up in arms , but the insatiable Abramovich wants Gazprom , and Voloshin yearns to become its next CEO . 
Will Putin stand against them ? 
A smaller drama concerns Russia &apos;s railways . 
Railway Minister Nikolai Aksenenko , who belongs to the oligarchic family , wants to turn the rail system into a monopoly akin to Gazprom , while the St. Petersburg liberals want to divide the rail network into competing private companies . 
The outcome remains unclear . 
Beside Gazprom , the banking system is Russia &apos;s economic black hole . 
No sensible person keeps money in a Russian bank . 
Here , the stumbling block is the old-style apparatchik Viktor Gerashchenko , Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia , who thrives on the mess . 
Because he is not involved in the power struggle , and since banking reform is a huge task , nobody seems prepared to take him on . 
Daily , each of Putin &apos;s three faces can be seen . 
The future of his presidency will depend on which two ever will join into a unified faction .
