Israel &apos;s European Peace ? 
MADRID - As the dramatic events unfolding across the Middle East capture global attention , the numerous challenges facing Israel are being largely overlooked . 
In fact , Israel is confronting one of the most dangerous periods in its existence . 
Not only do long-standing concerns like the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran remain unresolved ; all of Israel &apos;s neighbors are now either beset by or hurtling toward upheaval . 
And , though US-brokered peace talks with Palestine have resumed , they are likely to end in failure . 
But there is one promising development : the European Union , in an uncharacteristic show of backbone , has issued written guidelines prohibiting cooperation with Israeli companies operating in the West Bank and East Jerusalem . 
This bold move could presage a game-changing role for the EU in bringing about a long-awaited resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict . 
Such an outcome could not arrive soon enough , especially given the unprecedented chaos on Israel &apos;s borders . 
In Egypt , the tense , polarized environment following the military &apos;s overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi has created the real possibility of civil conflict . 
Although Israel was initially apprehensive about an Islamist government across its Sinai border , the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s value - its ability to influence Hamas , the dominant political force in Gaza - quickly became apparent . 
The nature and posture of the new military-led regime remains to be seen . 
Meanwhile , Syria &apos;s civil war has begun to spill over into Israel &apos;s Golan Heights . 
The introduction of chemical weapons and the possibility of Western military intervention threaten to draw Israel directly into the conflict . 
The spillover effects of the Syrian crisis have also unsettled Lebanon , exemplified in the recent spate of sectarian violence , and threaten to destabilize Jordan , which is struggling under the burden of more than 500,000 Syrian refugees . 
It is in this highly uncertain context that US Secretary of State John Kerry sought to restart Israel-Palestine peace negotiations . 
Three potential approaches were discussed : talks without preconditions , talks following a settlement freeze , and talks following the release of Palestinian prisoners . 
Unexpectedly , a modified version of the third option - whereby 104 Palestinian prisoners will be released in phases over the course of the negotiations - ultimately facilitated the resumption of talks . 
Despite its apparent success , however , the bargain dealt a serious blow to the legitimacy of the peace process . 
The first tranche of 26 prisoners - all of them tried and convicted by Israeli courts for their involvement in the killing of Israelis - were released from custody in July , ahead of the second round of talks . 
The problem is that many of their victims were civilians , not military personnel or government officials , causing outrage among the Israeli public . 
Yet the Palestinian Authority demanded their release , Israel &apos;s government obliged , and the US supported the transaction . 
By endorsing a false peace-justice tradeoff , instead of insisting on the more politically difficult option of a settlement freeze , or on the removal of preconditions , the US has jettisoned legality from the peace process . 
Furthermore , this approach undercuts the credibility of the rule of law in Israel . 
As Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu put it , the agreement &quot; collides with the incomparably important value of justice . &quot; 
That collision is all the more jarring , given that the prisoners are not being released in support of a final agreement ; they are merely facilitating the initiation of a negotiation process that appears to lack commitment from either side . 
Just days before the second round of talks began , Israel announced plans to proceed with the construction of 1,200 homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem . 
This suggests that , while the prisoner release may lead to a short-term agreement , it is not backed by a genuine effort to develop the kind of trust-based arrangements that are needed for lasting peace . 
Against this background , the EU &apos;s unexpected stand is notable , not only for its technical features , but also for its practical and symbolic implications . 
In all future agreements with the EU or any of its member states , Israel &apos;s government will have to acknowledge explicitly that territories beyond the pre-1967 borders are not part of Israel . 
While the guidelines simply formalized existing EU policy , they drew immediate criticism , with Netanyahu declaring that they &quot; undermined peace &quot; and &quot; hardened Palestinian positions &quot; during negotiations . 
This strong reaction reflects the profound importance of the EU &apos;s ties with Israel , undercutting the long-held assumption that the US is the only outside actor that can influence Israeli policy . 
Given the EU &apos;s robust relationship with Israel - underpinned by its role as Israel &apos;s largest trade partner , accounting for roughly 26 % of total Israeli exports and 34 % of its imports - it can develop powerful incentives that could provide the impetus that the peace process needs to succeed . 
The easiest option would be conditional liberalization of trade in services within the existing framework of the EU-Israel Association Agreement . 
But the challenging strategic environment and legacy of failed negotiations call for a more daring approach : The EU should take the initiative in persuading its partners in the European Economic Area to offer Israel membership , conditional on the completion of a peace agreement . 
Beyond deepening the EU &apos;s internal market , such a move would serve as a powerful symbol of the value and potential of the EU-Israel relationship , opening the way to further integration in the future . 
Europe has an historic opportunity to help resolve one of the world &apos;s longest-running and seemingly most intractable conflicts . 
It is thus simultaneously an opportunity for the EU to assert itself , at long last , as an effective force in world affairs .
