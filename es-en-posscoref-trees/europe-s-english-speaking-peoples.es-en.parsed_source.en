Europe &apos;s English-Speaking Peoples 
The European Union has a single currency , but what about a single language ? 
Since its inception , the EU has made each member state &apos;s language one of its official tongues . 
Recently , even Irish , spoken at home by only a tiny minority , was granted full official status . 
Treating all EU languages on the same footing is a direct consequence of the formal equality of member states under the founding treaties . 
It is also a matter of democratic principle that laws are written in the language of every land where they apply . 
But the EU &apos;s posture as a protector of linguistic diversity cannot hide the stampede toward English that is underway . 
The more languages , it seems , the more English . 
Yet , the European Commission still encourages young Europeans to learn as many different languages as possible . 
It would be politically lethal to acknowledge the real state of affairs , even if the official policy merely increases the chances that Europeans , after all their efforts , still may not understand each other . 
Such an outcome is unlikely , but only because Europe &apos;s language problem is well on its way to solving itself . 
Throughout the EU , as in much of the world , from the Indian subcontinent to large parts of Africa , English increasingly functions as the language of international communication . 
To be sure , in EU institutions &quot; public and ceremonial meetings , interpretation and translation must be equally available , at least in principle , from every language into every other . 
Each day , hundreds of interpreters literally pay lip service to this lofty precept , and millions of pages are translated annually so that citizens may consult EU law in their own language . 
The EU initially invested heavily in the development of machine translation , but has essentially abandoned the project . 
As a result , translation and interpretation increasingly proceed in two steps , from a lesser-used language to half a dozen &quot; relay &quot; languages , and from those into other , smaller languages . 
This saves resources , but it also implies a considerable loss of meaning . 
Moreover , fewer languages are used in the EU &apos;s smokeless backrooms when meetings are less formal and the participants not all that prestigious . 
When EU officials meet together or draft internal documents , they use only the &quot; working languages &quot; : French and , more often , English . 
German , the EU &apos;s most widely spoken native language , hardly makes a dent . 
Representatives may demand interpretation into their home language , but a proposal to limit each country &apos;s translation budget is likely to be accepted soon . 
The predominance of English is even more pronounced in communications among the EU &apos;s citizens , where it is the first foreign language in all countries of the &quot; old &quot; Europe . 
Among the EU &apos;s new members , English is rapidly replacing Russian as the most widely used foreign language . 
Indeed , nine out of ten schoolchildren in the EU now learn English . 
Roughly half as many learn French , a quarter German and an eighth Spanish , and these numbers are falling , despite the Commission &apos;s efforts , because people tend to choose the foreign language that they believe is spoken and studied the most by others . 
The process resembles the selection of a standard in , say , consumer electronics . 
People tend to opt for the standard ( VHS , Windows , DVD ) that they believe will come out on top , and thus contribute to that victory . 
English now seems to have reached the point of no return in its accelerating global expansion , competing with national languages in such diverse fields as popular music , transport , the Internet , banking , cinema and television , science , and sports . 
But , while the presence and pressure of English has a striking impact on the vocabulary of the home language , it leaves the syntax , grammar , and pronunciation almost entirely unaffected . 
Unlike the indigenous languages that were pushed aside by the languages of the European colonizers , the official languages of the EU are &quot; robust &quot; : they are equipped with grammars , dictionaries , archives , libraries , and linguistics faculties . 
They have a centuries-old printed literature , and , above all , they are closely guarded by strong states . 
As a result , English will not so easily marginalize European languages , even after a large majority of the population has learned it . 
But English and national languages can co-exist only if the state protects the indigenous language and citizens do not allow English to take over all prestigious domains . 
The diversity of Europe is indeed innate , but its unity is yet to be achieved . 
The commitment to European integration requires a common vernacular , and that is English . 
The challenge for Europe is to use English as such an instrument , while avoiding submersion in American and British culture .
