The Secret World of Female Circumcision 
NAIROBI - As a child in rural Kenya , I was a secret admirer of female genital mutilation . 
I was swayed by talk of friends and elders about how once a girl undergoes &quot; the cut , &quot; she gains respect and grown men consider her suitable for marriage . 
Perhaps these were the reasons why , as a girl of 13 , I longed to be &quot; circumcised &quot; and become a &quot; real woman . &quot; 
My mother opposed the practice , however , because she was ( and remains ) a Christian and wanted me to become educated and to escape the fate of many girls in my community who are married off to older men and then lose their autonomy . 
I tried to persuade my mother to permit my circumcision , but she refused . 
My mother &apos;s decision angered me . 
In frustration , I spoke with a few other schoolgirls . 
Each of them gave a different version of the process , but they held a common view : circumcision is intensely painful , and I must be prepared for much bleeding . 
And yet the friends to whom I spoke encouraged me to get circumcised . 
So one August , during my school holidays , I decided to learn more about female genital circumcision . 
I decided to witness a girl undergoing the practice , and perhaps see her cry and bleed . 
If possible , I would talk to her later in order to gain a clearer picture of her experience . 
I went ahead with my plan and witnessed a girl being circumcised . 
The experience changed my life , but not in the way I expected . 
Before the operation , traditional heroic songs were sung , while a few older women sharpened their knives , preparing for the task ahead . 
They also prepared special herbs for use as disinfectants . 
I paid little attention to their preparations , actually . 
My eyes were fixed on Lillian , a girlfriend who was waiting to be cut . 
When the women began their work , Lillian &apos;s expression turned from giddy anticipation to fear and then panic . 
I thought she might change her mind and run for her life . 
I was mistaken . 
She sat on a traditional stool and spread her legs wide apart . 
An old woman bent over her , knife in hand . 
I looked away and heard a sharp scream . 
The scream was swallowed by cheers from scores of women watching Lillian with me . 
They celebrated Lillian &apos;s mutilation , while I mourned her loss . 
In my mind , Lillian was experiencing the worst moment of her life . 
In an instant , my view of female circumcision changed forever . 
While the women around me kept cheering , I resolved that from then on I would resist the practice with all my might . 
Because of my mother &apos;s support , and my own determination , I succeeded in keeping my body intact . 
I went on to finish high school and then study journalism in a big city far from home . 
Today , living and working in cosmopolitan Nairobi , I look back with a mixture of horror and bemusement on my girlhood fascination with female circumcision . 
I escaped mutilation , but other girls from my rural Kenyan community continue to receive &quot; the cut &quot; to this day . 
Only last month , in Narok , the town nearest my childhood village , a 13-year-old girl died after undergoing circumcision as a preparation for her marriage to a man who already had five wives . 
When the girl died , her father and fianc√© conspired to have her body secretly buried in the bush . 
Kenya &apos;s police learned of the girl &apos;s death and legal action is being prepared against the men . 
But punishment for the perpetrators of female circumcision remains rare . 
The practice persists , despite legal bans . 
As a child-welfare officer in Narok told me , &quot; Unless attitudes are changed , efforts to stamp out the practice will be futile . &quot; 
Parents &quot; attitudes are changing , but slowly . 
Government can do more , of course . 
One new initiative calls for local leaders to be dismissed whenever high numbers of girls drop out of school . 
The logic is compelling : if girls remain in school , they can avoid &quot; the cut &quot; and early marriage . 
Once educated , these girls may decide for themselves - as I did - to resist mistreatment at the hands of their family and neighbors . 
At the same time , much more needs to be done to combat the practice , in Kenya and everywhere in Africa where it continues . 
International opposition helps . 
For decades , activists in the United States and Europe have brought attention to the problem and urged African governments to prosecute perpetrators . 
Nevertheless , because female genital mutilation is tied to a wider set of traditional practices involving the control of girls &quot; bodies and minds , and because these traditions have a powerful hold on some Africans , ultimately the practice can be halted only through concerted efforts by Africans themselves . 
Only if we change the views of our friends and neighbors can more girls escape &quot; the cut &quot; - and never long for it .
