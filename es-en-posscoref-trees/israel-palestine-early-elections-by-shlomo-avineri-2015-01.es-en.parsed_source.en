The Fall of Netanyahu ? 
JERUSALEM - The dissolution of Israel &apos;s parliament , the Knesset , just a day after Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu sacked two senior cabinet ministers , marks a surprising turnabout . 
Indeed , when Israelis vote again in March , more than two years ahead of schedule , Netanyahu could be voted out of office , with important implications not only for Israel , but also for the wider Middle East . 
Until last summer , Netanyahu appeared politically unassailable . 
Not even 10 % of Israelis would have preferred the opposition leader , the Labor Party &apos;s Yitzhak Herzog , as Prime Minister . 
Things began to unravel when two cabinet ministers abruptly resigned , citing family commitments or policy disagreements . 
Then came the inconclusive war in Gaza , which , given Netanyahu &apos;s unfulfilled pledge to &quot; crush Hamas , &quot; undermined his credibility , especially when ministers like Naftali Bennett , the leader of the nationalist-religious Jewish Home party , openly challenged his policies . 
When some European parliaments voted in 2014 to recognize Palestine as an independent state , many Israelis , who had long blamed the Palestinians for the continued failure of peace talks , began to worry . 
More significant , Netanyahu &apos;s public clashes with US President Barack Obama fueled concerns among Israelis - including supporters of Netanyahu &apos;s Likud party - that their government &apos;s policies were deepening Israel &apos;s isolation and thus undermining its security . 
The domestic situation is not much better . 
Netanyahu has failed to fulfill his promises since the massive demonstrations of 2011 to address prohibitively high living costs , especially for young couples . 
On the contrary , housing prices have continued to rise . 
When Yair Lapid - the ambitious but inept finance minister , who leads the centrist Yesh Atid party - proposed waiving the value-added tax on first apartment purchases by young couples , Netanyahu failed to respond decisively , giving the impression that he lacked control over his own cabinet . 
But it was Netanyahu &apos;s support for draft legislation seeking to constitutionalize Israel &apos;s identity as the Jewish people &apos;s nation-state - to the detriment of Israel &apos;s Muslim , Christian , and Druze citizens - that brought the situation to a head . 
The bill , which emphasizes Israel &apos;s Jewish identity above its democratic principles , has caused deep divisions not only among the electorate , but also within the government coalition . 
Netanyahu , with his weak and vacillating leadership exposed , sacked his opponents , Lapid and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni ( who also denounced Netanyahu &apos;s settlement-construction plans ) , and called for new elections . 
But the real game changer was the declaration by Herzog and Livni , who leads the small centrist Hatnuah party , that their parties would run jointly in the elections . 
If they win , they will rotate in the prime minister &apos;s post . 
This changed Israeli political discourse almost overnight . 
Yesh Atid voters , who have been disappointed by Lapid &apos;s failure to deliver the &quot; new politics &quot; of efficiency and transparency that he promised , may supply the Herzog-Livni alliance with the necessary votes . 
Some of the moderate orthodox parties , which have been undergoing their own internal splits , have also signaled their willingness to work with a center-left bloc that might enable Israel to make real progress . 
Even Minister of Foreign Affairs Avigdor Lieberman , head of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party , is now criticizing Netanyahu for alienating the US and has suggested that he would not rule out joining a centrist government . 
All of this bodes well for the Herzog-Livni alliance . 
But three months is a long time in politics . 
Netanyahu may be a dismal prime minister ; but he is also a formidable campaigner . 
And if the centrist alliance finishes first in the election , it will still need coalition partners to form a majority in the Knesset . 
Gaining fewer than 30 of its 120 seats might drive it to seek potential partners among the orthodox - an approach that could alienate moderate secular voters . 
Moreover , once in power , the Herzog-Livni alliance would be met with serious challenges - beginning with reaching an agreement with the Palestinians . 
Given that the Palestinians &quot; political leadership is divided between the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority , which controls the West Bank , and Hamas , which has established an Islamic fundamentalist regime in Gaza , a deal between Israel and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas would mean little . 
Nonetheless , a Herzog-Livni government would bring significant change , particularly in terms of relations with Europe and the US . 
Netanyahu &apos;s provocative policies and statements , which have undermined support for Israel among even its closest allies , would be supplanted by a willingness to negotiate in earnest and make genuine concessions . 
Such a shift would reinvigorate hope among Israelis - and not a moment too soon . 
There is a growing realization in Israel that it is time to chart a new path . 
Netanyahu , always eager to impress upon the Israeli public the impossibility of making peace with the Palestinians , failed to address the question of what kind of country Israel will become if it continues to rule millions of people against their will . 
This is what has turned so many people in the West against Israel , leading some to question its very legitimacy . 
If Zionism means eternal dominion over the Palestinians , is it really worthy of support ? 
The Herzog-Livni alliance has tentatively named itself the &quot; Zionist Camp . &quot; 
It may not be catchy ( and it is likely to be changed ) , but it expresses an essential truth : Zionism is about the right of the Jewish people to self-determination , not about the permanent domination of another people . 
One hopes that Israeli voters recognize this in March .
