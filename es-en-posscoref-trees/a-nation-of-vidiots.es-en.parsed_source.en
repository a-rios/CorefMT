A Nation of Vidiots 
NEW YORK - The past half-century has been the age of electronic mass media . 
Television has reshaped society in every corner of the world . 
Now an explosion of new media devices is joining the TV set : DVDs , computers , game boxes , smart phones , and more . 
A growing body of evidence suggests that this media proliferation has countless ill effects . 
The United States led the world into the television age , and the implications can be seen most directly in America &apos;s long love affair with what Harlan Ellison memorably called &quot; the glass teat . &quot; 
In 1950 , fewer than 8 % of American households owned a TV ; by 1960 , 90 % had one . 
That level of penetration took decades longer to achieve elsewhere , and the poorest countries are still not there . 
True to form , Americans became the greatest TV watchers , which is probably still true today , even though the data are somewhat sketchy and incomplete . 
The best evidence suggests that Americans watch more than five hours per day of television on average - a staggering amount , given that several hours more are spent in front of other video-streaming devices . 
Other countries log far fewer viewing hours . 
In Scandinavia , for example , time spent watching TV is roughly half the US average . 
The consequences for American society are profound , troubling , and a warning to the world - though it probably comes far too late to be heeded . 
First , heavy TV viewing brings little pleasure . 
Many surveys show that it is almost like an addiction , with a short-term benefit leading to long-term unhappiness and remorse . 
Such viewers say that they would prefer to watch less than they do . 
Moreover , heavy TV viewing has contributed to social fragmentation . 
Time that used to be spent together in the community is now spent alone in front of the screen . 
Robert Putnam , the leading scholar of America &apos;s declining sense of community , has found that TV viewing is the central explanation of the decline of &quot; social capital , &quot; the trust that binds communities together . 
Americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago . 
Certainly , heavy TV viewing is bad for one &apos;s physical and mental health . 
Americans lead the world in obesity , with roughly two-thirds of the US population now overweight . 
Again , many factors underlie this , including a diet of cheap , unhealthy fried foods , but the sedentary time spent in front of the TV is an important influence as well . 
At the same time , what happens mentally is as important as what happens physically . 
Television and related media have been the greatest purveyors and conveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society . 
America &apos;s TV ownership is almost entirely in private hands , and owners make much of their money through relentless advertising . 
Effective advertising campaigns , appealing to unconscious urges - typically related to food , sex , and status - create cravings for products and purchases that have little real value for consumers or society . 
The same , of course , has happened to politics . 
American politicians are now brand names , packaged like breakfast cereal . 
Anybody - and any idea - can be sold with a bright ribbon and a catchy jingle . 
All roads to power in America lead through TV , and all access to TV depends on big money . 
This simple logic has put American politics in the hands of the rich as never before . 
Even war can be rolled out as a new product . 
The Bush administration promoted the premises of the Iraq war - Saddam Hussein &apos;s non-existent weapons of mass destruction -in the familiar colorful , fast-paced , and graphics-heavy style of television advertising . 
Then the war itself began with the so-called &quot; shock and awe &quot; bombing of Baghdad - a made-for-TV live spectacle aimed at ensuring high ratings for the US-led invasion . 
Many neuroscientists believe that the mental-health effects of TV viewing might run even deeper than addiction , consumerism , loss of social trust , and political propaganda . 
Perhaps TV is rewiring heavy viewers &quot; brains and impairing their cognitive capacities . 
The American Academy of Pediatrics recently warned that TV viewing by young children is dangerous for their brain development , and called on parents to keep children under two away from the TV and similar media . 
A recent survey in the US by the organization Common Sense Media reveals a paradox , but one that is perfectly understandable . 
Children in poor American households today not only watch more TV than children in wealthy households , but are also more likely to have a television in their room . 
When a commodity &apos;s consumption falls as income rises , economists call it an &quot; inferior &quot; good . 
To be sure , the mass media can be useful as a provider of information , education , entertainment , and even political awareness . 
But too much of it is confronting us with dangers that we need to avoid . 
At the very least , we can minimize those dangers . 
Successful approaches around the world include limits on TV advertising , especially to young children ; non-commercial , publicly-owned TV networks like the BBC ; and free ( but limited ) TV time for political campaigns . 
Of course , the best defense is our own self-control . 
We can all leave the TV off more hours per day and spend that time reading , talking with each other , and rebuilding the bases of personal health and social trust .
