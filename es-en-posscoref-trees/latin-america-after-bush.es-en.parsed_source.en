Latin America After Bush 
Once again , America &apos;s president has come up short in Latin America . 
Granted , President George W. Bush was well received by all his hosts in the five countries he visited , with traditional Latin American hospitality and cordiality . 
There were no major , unfortunate incidents ; the constant protests were strident but not especially violent or well-attended ; no significant slights or mishaps took place ; and President Bush achieved what he probably was most interested in : sending a message back to the United States that he actually is interested in more than Iraq . 
He also accomplished , in a somewhat round-about way , another goal : showing the flag , so to speak , in the face of the mounting challenge from Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez , who , thanks to virtually unlimited supplies of oil dollars and Cuban doctors and foot-soldiers , is riding high across Latin America . 
Chávez baited Bush at almost every stop along the way , but the US leader evaded the provocations , and indeed , probably bested Chávez in the sense that an unpopular US president managed to dominate the agenda and take the battle of ideas directly to Latin American audiences , with whom the Venezuelans and the Cubans are in contact every day . 
Bush was also able to partly change the tone of the US message in the hemisphere : from free trade and fighting terrorism , to combating poverty and strengthening democracy and human rights . 
If Bush had made this trip several years ago , things would be different today . 
But everyone would also be in better shape today if Bush had been able to actually deliver on the main issues his interlocutors took up with him . 
Here , despite the photo-ops and the hugs and the local cuisine , the American president was simply not ready , willing or able , to give satisfaction to his colleagues , from capital to capital . 
In Brasil , President Luiz Ignacio da Silva Lula &apos;s main issue , demand and hope was for a reduction or elimination in the US tariff on ethanol imports . 
Bush said no , since the tariff is congressionally mandated , and thus greatly diluted the importance of the bio-fuel cooperation agreement the two governments signed . 
In Uruguay , President Tabaré Vázquez went out on a limb simply by hosting Bush , given that his problems with his Chávez-friendly neighbor in Argentina , Nestor Kirchner , can only worsen as a result of these &quot; dangerous &quot; acquaintances . 
Vázquez needed some cover on the status of Urugayan immigrants in the US , and mainly , increases in quotas for its exports to the American market . 
Again , Bush left him hanging . 
Alvaro Uribe of Colombia was happy just to have a US Chief of State visit Bogotá ; the last one to do so was Ronald Reagan in 1982 . 
In fact , Bush &apos;s was a brave gesture : despite Uribe &apos;s success in combating drugs , paramilitaries and guerrillas , his capital is not an especially safe place . 
Bush also gave him his backing on human rights concerns , which , coming from the gentleman responsible - in the eyes of most of the world  -  for Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib , is perhaps damning with faint praise . 
But most disappointingly for Uribe , though understandably , the US President was unable to bring with him guaranteed congressional support either for Colombia &apos;s Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) with the US , nor funding renewal for the so-called Plan Colombia . 
In Guatemala , once again , President Oscar Berger was obviously proud to receive Bush , but failed to obtain a commitment from him to stop the inhuman , hateful Homeland Security raids by US law enforcement officers against undocumented immigrants , exemplified by the detention and attempt at deportation , on the eve of Bush &apos;s visit , of nearly 300 Guatemalans working at a Massachussetts , military vest factory . 
Where Bush fared best , perhaps , was in Mérida , Mexico , where Felipe Calderón not only received him as the gracious host Mexican presidents always are - though he rightly slammed his guest on the fence the US is building here and there along the two countries &quot; border -  but got in return what he needed , and wanted most . 
The American made a firm , explicit and apparently sincere commitment to lobby as strongly as possibly for what he calls &quot; comprehensive immigration reform &quot; and what in Mexico is commonly known as &quot; the whole enchilada . &quot; 
Whether Bush can deliver the goods is obviously open to question , but since Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid traveled to Mexico City two days later to make the same commitment , it seems that Mexico &apos;s six years of vain efforts might finally prove fruitful . 
Needless to say , Calderón was thrilled , particularly because he had begun backing away from the emphasis his predecessor , Vicente Fox , placed on the immigration issue . 
Conversely , if Bush cannot come up with enough Republican moderates in the US Senate - they are actually already there , probably  -  and in the US House of Representatives , the letdown and resentment in Mexico ( as well as everywhere in Central America , the Caribbean , Peru , Ecuador and Colombia ) will be immense . 
So where do the US and Latin America go from here ? 
Several crucial decisions lay ahead . 
The first is for the US and the rest of the region to wholeheartedly support , and if possible reinforce , the democracy and human rights protection instruments developed over the years , given the precarious nature of democracy and respect for human rights in nations like Ecuador , Venezuela , Bolivia and others . 
Second , the White House must not only get the pending free trade agreements ratified by Congress , but should improve them , learning from the NAFTA experience , make them more poverty-sensitive , more environmentally- and labor-oriented , and provide more support for infrastructure and training . 
Third , and perhaps most importantly , Bush has to finally achieve the immigration reform he has promised for so long . 
Stop building fences - even if they do make good neighbors  -  and cease the harassment of undocumented people in the US . 
It &apos;s hateful , needless , and futile : as Bush said himself , the US will never , could never , and should never deport twelve million people , illegal or not .
