The Nemesis of Turkish Power 
PARIS - A few days ago , Turkey &apos;s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told Al Jazeera , the pan-Arab television network , that he would use his warships to prevent Israeli commandos from again boarding Gaza-bound ships , as they did last year . 
So , will a &quot; Turkish Summer &quot; be the first , if not the main , strategic result of the &quot; Arab Spring &quot; ? 
Is the Middle East faced with a neo-Ottoman Turkey &apos;s irresistible rise to regional power ? 
And could the world be witnessing the &quot; Orientalization &quot; of Turkey ? 
The Arab revolutions , following on the European Union &apos;s resounding &quot; No , Yes , But &quot; to Turkey &apos;s membership bid , have reinforced among Turks the attraction of the Orient while liberating their mix of nationalistic and religious impulses . 
Indeed , Erdoğan makes more references to God in his public statements nowadays than he ever did in the past . 
Over the last few years , the Western world has been asking itself , with a mixture of guilt and apprehension , &quot; Who lost Turkey &quot; ? 
Turkey &apos;s government was no better at anticipating the changes in the Arab world than were local regimes and Western powers . 
At the end of 2010 , Erdoğan was the ( last ) recipient of a human-rights prize granted by Libya &apos;s Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi . 
Turkey has also tried , desperately at times , to maintain good relations with Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime in Syria , despite the Syrian government &apos;s abominable behavior . 
Turkey &apos;s position was , to say the least , perceived badly by the &quot; Arab street . &quot; 
A major reason for Turkey &apos;s tougher position towards Israel , one suspects , is Erdoğan &apos;s attempt to rebalance the country &apos;s regional image . 
Despite its difficulty in grasping the reality and depth of the Arab revolutionary process , Turkey is nonetheless more than ever a key player in the region . 
It may not be a model in the strict sense of the term , but it is at least a source of inspiration throughout the region , even though much of its record is ambiguous in both essence and performance . 
In seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe , the &quot; exoticism &quot; of the Ottoman Empire was used as a mirror to project Europeans &quot; own shortcomings and insecurities . 
In France , one spoke of &quot; Turqueries , &quot; such as in Moliere &apos;s play &quot; The Bourgeois Gentilhomme . &quot; 
Today , it is the Arab world that tends to use Turkey the way that Europe did in the past . 
This time , however , it is modernity , not exoticism , that is the source of fascination . 
It is a mirror in which the Arab world projects its fears , as well as its hopes . 
At a strategic level , Turkey is correct in thinking that the Arab revolutionary process has weakened its direct rivals . 
Iran , for example , is on the verge of losing the faithful junior partner that it had in Syria . 
Will it have to get the bomb , too ? 
The &quot; Middle Empire &quot; of the Middle East will no longer remain a sleeping giant . 
Of course , Turkey is less destabilized than its Arab rivals and partners by a revolutionary process that does not directly challenge it . 
After all , Turkey is already a functioning democracy . 
Turkey is also much less worried about its future than Israel is . 
Compared with the small Jewish state , Turkey has an expanding population and a deep awareness of its historical , religious , and cultural affinities with its neighbors . 
These important assets make Turkey an &quot; indispensable nation &quot; in the region . 
So , what threatens Turkey today is Turkey itself . 
Turkey is not &quot; Asian &quot; only in terms of economic energy and rapid growth : it is also Asian in a more political sense , with the rising temptation of a form of &quot; Oriental despotism . &quot; 
Indeed , for many years , domestic critics of Erdoğan &apos;s government have been denouncing what they describe as the &quot; Putinization &quot; of the regime . 
Turkey , not the European Union , is currently making its presence felt in the world . 
In reality , Turkey needs Europe as much as Europe needs Turkey . 
Europe is for Turkey &quot; a principle of moderation &quot; and an enticement to remain democratic . 
Turkey is for Europe , beyond its demography , &quot; a principle of energy &quot; and a cure for pessimism - even if , as Erdoğan is showing , self-confidence can easily turn into hubris .
