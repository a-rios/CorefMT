Making Old Age Less Safe 
It is almost an optical illusion : looming on Japan &apos;s horizon , and on Europe &apos;s and on America &apos;s , is a pensions crisis . 
The problem is real , though exaggerated . 
The illusion is in some of the plans being devised to deal with it . 
The main question is whether privatizing pension systems , as President George W. Bush has proposed for Social Security in the United States , would solve the problem or merely make matters worse . 
With many countries pondering whether to adopt variants of the Bush plan , the question requires careful examination . 
By itself , privatization is clearly not the solution . 
America &apos;s troubled private pension system - now several hundred billion dollars in debt - already appears headed for a government bailout . 
There was a time when privatization - allowing individuals to set up individual savings accounts - seemed better than Social Security , which invests in lower-yielding Treasury bills . 
Advocates of privatization argued that funds would do much better if invested in stocks , predicting a return of 9 % . 
But the stock market does not guarantee returns ; it does not even guarantee that the stock values will keep up with inflation - and there have been periods in which they have not . 
America &apos;s Social Security system insulates individuals against the vagaries of the market and inflation , providing a form of insurance that the private market does not offer . 
It does so with remarkable efficiency . 
The costs of managing the Social Security system are far smaller than those likely to be associated with privatized accounts . 
This is understandable : private investment firms spend an enormous amount on marketing and salaries . 
It is possible that to reduce these transactions costs , Bush will propose restricting choice , which was the main argument for privatization in the first place . 
But these limited kinds of choices - for example , a T-bill fund with 90 % in T-bills and 10 % in an indexed stock fund - could easily be introduced into the public social security system . 
Bush says that reform is urgently needed , because the system will be insolvent in about a quarter-century . 
But the problem depends on America &apos;s growth rate : if the growth rates of the late 1990 &quot; s return , there is no problem . 
Even if there is a problem , it can easily be fixed ; spending a fraction of the money that went into Bush &apos;s two tax cuts would have fixed Social Security for 75 years ; slight benefit cuts , adjusting the age of retirement , or minor adjustments in the level of contributions could fix the system permanently . 
Moreover , Bush &apos;s proposals won &apos;t fix social security - unless they are accompanied by drastic benefit cuts . 
For how could they ? 
He proposes diverting almost a third of the Social Security tax to private accounts . 
That means less money coming in . 
If benefits are not reduced , the gap between receipts and expenditures will increase . 
One doesn &apos;t need a Nobel Prize to figure that out . 
So privatization would not protect retirees against the Social Security system &apos;s insolvency ; it would merely add enormously to today &apos;s fiscal deficit , because partial privatization entails diverting money to private funds that would have been used to close the gap between government expenditures and revenue . 
The anticipated increase in the fiscal deficit is striking : the central plan discussed by Bush &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers would - according to the Council &apos;s own estimates - increase America &apos;s fiscal deficit by $ 2 trillion over the next decade . 
Advocates of privatization claim to believe in markets , but they are proposing budget gimmickry that would move those losses off the books , as if markets could be easily fooled . 
America and the world should remember : Argentina &apos;s privatization of its pension system was at the center of its recent fiscal woes . 
Had Argentina not privatized , its budget would have been roughly in balance . 
The US is starting on its privatization venture with a fiscal deficit of 4 % of GDP . 
Privatization advocates insist , however , that investments in stocks would yield sufficiently higher returns to provide individuals the same retirement income as before , with the surplus used to fill the gap . 
But if markets are working well , then returns will be higher only because risk is higher . 
There is still no free lunch in economics . 
With higher risk , there is a chance that , 40 years from now , many individuals will find themselves with less than they need to retire . 
But if one really thinks that free lunches exist , there is still no reason to privatize : government could get the additional returns by investing in the stock market itself . 
Indeed , President Clinton proposed doing just that . 
With increased transaction costs , worsening solvency for the system , increased budget deficits , and decreasing benefits and security for retirees , why the drive for privatization ? 
One reason is the interest financial markets have in grabbing a piece of all those transactions costs . 
A second is the Bush administration &apos;s ideological hostility to the modest amount of wealth redistribution implied by the public system . 
America &apos;s Social Security program has been so successful in reducing poverty because the poor get back a little more than they contribute , and the rich get back a little less . 
Even with Social Security &apos;s mildly redistributive effect , poverty and inequality in America are increasing . 
Privatization will only make matters worse . 
Bush has tried to scare America about the magnitude of the problem , and he has tried to fool America about how privatization would solve it . 
The Social Security deficit pales by comparison with the deficits created by Bush &apos;s huge tax cuts for upper-income Americans or in comparison with the deficit in Medicare , which provides health care for the aged . 
Why has he ignored these problems ? 
Is there another agenda ?
