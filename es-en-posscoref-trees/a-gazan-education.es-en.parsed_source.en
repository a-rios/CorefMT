A Gazan Education 
GAZA - This was supposed to be my first year of medical school . 
Instead , I am stuck here in Gaza , in my father &apos;s house inside the Jabalia refugee camp , with few options and no way out . 
After I finished high school last year , I decided to become a doctor . 
Gaza cries out for bone specialists , but the training I need is available only abroad . 
When I won a place at a medical college in Germany , my parents were proud . 
I was excited to follow my older brother , who is already studying there . 
In February , the German authorities granted me an entrance visa . 
I wasted no time in asking the Israeli authorities for permission to travel to Europe . 
Hundreds of other young people trapped in the Gaza Strip have won admission to study abroad . 
For many of us , this is our only opportunity to continue our education . 
Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth , and one of the poorest - 1.5 million of us live on a patch of land about 41 kilometers long and 6-12 kilometers wide . 
The local hospitals lack the equipment needed to perform many important procedures , like radiation treatments for cancer patients and heart surgery . 
Universities in Gaza are overcrowded and starved for supplies . 
Many subjects are not even taught , and there are few post-graduate programs . 
Instructors from abroad cannot enter Gaza . 
Without the ability to go overseas , we cannot learn . 
In June , after the United States pressured Israel to allow Fulbright scholarship winners to leave the Gaza Strip , the Israeli military announced that it would grant exit permits for a few more students with &quot; recognized &quot; scholarships - but not &quot; hundreds . &quot; 
So hundreds of us are still waiting , most without prestigious scholarships to draw the world &apos;s attention . 
I am sure to be one of the many who will not be allowed to leave . 
Life in Gaza has bled away my optimism . 
My father is a teacher and owns a children &apos;s clothing shop . 
I have six brothers and three sisters . 
We returned to Palestine in 1996 from Saudi Arabia , where my father had been working as a teacher . 
That was at the height of the peace process . 
My parents put their hope in the Oslo Accords signed in 1993 , and decided that they could give us a better life here . 
But when I was ten , the second 
With the backing of the US , Canada , and the European Union , Israel has maintained its blockade in an attempt to defeat Hamas , which won the elections here in 2006 . 
Hamas and other armed groups , I know , have launched rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip that have killed civilians in Israeli towns and villages . 
But I also have witnessed how Israel has retaliated with air strikes and armed incursions into the Gaza Strip , including Jabalia . 
Israel &apos;s blockade amounts to collective punishment . 
It is hurting all of us , whether we support Hamas or not . 
It is also destroying my dream to write &quot; Specialist in Bone Medicine &quot; after my name . 
Sometimes , I am sorry that I am from Gaza . 
Sometimes , when there is electricity , I watch television and see how people live in other places . 
I ask myself why they have the opportunity to travel , to study , to take vacations , when I cannot go abroad even to learn medicine . 
We are students , not soldiers . 
We are not fighters in this conflict . 
Why doesn &apos;t Israel let us go study ? 
Why do Europe and America support a blockade of young minds ? 
Soon , my fellow classmates at the medical college will be starting classes . 
When they do , I will probably still be here in my father &apos;s house , waiting for the blockade to end .
