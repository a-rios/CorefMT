Will the Sun Still Rise ? 
TOKYO - The scale of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March was far greater than even the authorities &quot; worst scenarios foresaw . 
Nearly six months later , the total damage remains difficult to estimate . 
Social unrest and confusion , as well as radiation leaks from the Fukushima nuclear power plant , continue . 
And now the country has absorbed another huge blow : another downgrade of its bond ratings . 
Both Moody &apos;s and Standard 
Poor &apos;s now rate Japanese bonds at only their fourth-highest level . 
So what policies should be implemented in response to these economic blows ? 
Last year , Japan &apos;s economy grew at a relatively healthy 3 % annual rate , higher than in the United States or the European Union , owing mainly to the fiscal expansion undertaken after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 . 
But growth in 2011 had been predicted to slow even before the earthquake . 
Indeed , the economy shrank by 3.5 % year on year in the first quarter . 
Now , with so much fixed capital and infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami , the economy &apos;s productive capacity has fallen by an estimated 2 % of GDP . 
But that may not be a bad thing : Prior to the earthquake , Japan had a demand-supply gap of approximately 5 % of GDP . 
While reducing this gap to 3 % of GDP has led to higher prices , this is exactly what Japan needs after years of persistent deflation . 
Meanwhile , higher public spending on capital investment and other special procurements will boost domestic demand . 
The Hanshin earthquake in 1995 destroyed capital stock worth 2 % of GDP . 
This time , the loss is estimated at 3.4 % of GDP , implying a larger increase in domestic demand if the right public policies are pursued . 
On the downside , confidence among consumers and investors alike has taken a hit , mainly owing to fears about radiation leakages and power shortages . 
According to the Japan Center for Economic Research , power-supply disruptions could negatively affect the Japanese economy for the next three years . 
If the Tokyo metropolitan area &apos;s power supply were to decrease by 10 % this year , for example , Japan &apos;s GDP would fall by 2 % . 
Soon after the disaster , the government announced that reconstruction demand and higher prices would bring about relatively rapid economic recovery . 
I think this view is too optimistic , because I suspect that the government wants to finance its new expenditure with a tax hike . 
Moreover , the extremely sharp contraction in first-quarter GDP may indicate that the disaster &apos;s negative impact on the economy was more significant than expected . 
Indeed , the economy is expected to have shrunk by another 2.6 % year on year in the second quarter , with growth set to resume only in July-September . 
And , contrary to the government &apos;s outlook , the start of economic recovery could be delayed until the end of this year , with medium-term annual growth reaching 1.5- 2 % . 
A key question has been the disaster &apos;s impact on global supply chains . 
According to Japan &apos;s Ministry of Economy , Trade , and Industry , which surveyed firms roughly a month after the earthquake , more than 60 % of production sites in affected areas had already recovered as of April 15 . 
Almost 30 % expected to recover by the summer , and the remaining 10 % foresaw normal operations after the autumn . 
But the impact of even a small number of disruptions to supply chains can be highly significant , particularly for the Asia-Pacific region . 
Consider Renesas Electronics , a medium-size company , with ¥ 150 billion ( $ 1.9 billion ) in annual sales , which accounts for more than half of worldwide production of essential micro-computing components for automobiles . 
Partly as a result of the damage at Renesas , Toyota &apos;s capacity-utilization rate dropped to 50 % at the beginning of May . 
Likewise , the chemical manufacturer Kureha ( ¥ 130 billion in annual sales ) has a 70 % share of the global market for adhesive materials for lithium-ion batteries - a small but essential component of cell phones . 
Nokia in Finland , for example , imports 12 % of its cell-phone components from Japan , and thus could be indirectly affected by the disaster . 
As a result , more companies are likely to create and implement business continuity plans . 
Indeed , &quot; BCP &quot; is set to become a key term in the region &apos;s economic discourse . 
Using BCPs to determine alternative producers means that regional economies will be integrated in a new form , with companies establishing cooperative relationships even with their competitors . 
Unfortunately , Japan &apos;s public officials appear incapable of similar flexibility . 
The disaster confirmed the traditional view of Japan as a country that combines a dynamic private sector with an anemic public sector and central administration . 
The government &apos;s mistakes in so-called &quot; risk communication &quot; regarding the Fukushima nuclear plant , and its slowness in getting necessary aid to people displaced by the disaster , have once again put the stereotype on full display . 
In terms of international relations , however , the disaster could improve Japan &apos;s bilateral ties with influential countries . 
For example , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak met with outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan in Fukushima , near the damaged plant - helping to ease neighboring countries &quot; concerns about radiation leakage . 
Moreover , Japan &apos;s relations with the US , which had suffered since the Democratic Party of Japan came to power two years ago , appear to have emerged from the disaster stronger than ever . 
Japan &apos;s Self-Defense Forces played an important role in rescue and restoration activities , with about half of its 200,000 personnel dispatched to the damaged area . 
While this severely weakened Japan &apos;s defenses , the US ensured East Asia &apos;s security by deploying an aircraft carrier and cruisers , and American forces also searched for missing victims together with the JSDF . 
But Japan &apos;s neighbors expect rapid reconstruction and normalization , and for that , stronger political leadership is needed . 
The earthquake and tsunami have confronted Japan with a profound crisis - but also with a rare opportunity to undertake the comprehensive reforms that the country has postponed for far too long .
