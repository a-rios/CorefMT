Embracing Science 
Long-term economic progress comes mainly from the invention and spread of improved technologies . 
The scientific revolution was made possible by the printing press , the industrial revolution by the steam engine , and India &apos;s escape from famine by increased farm yields - the so-called &quot; Green Revolution . &quot; 
Today &apos;s era of globalization emerged with the spread of computers and the Internet . 
Thus , when we seek solutions to some of the world &apos;s toughest problems , they , too , are likely to be found , at least in part , in new technologies that can resolve old and seemingly intractable problems . 
Consider poverty in Africa . 
Every conceivable explanation has been given , usually focusing on what Africans do wrong . 
But a visit to Africa &apos;s villages makes clear that the problems have more to do with the struggle for survival under difficult physical conditions than with any special problems that are unique to African societies . 
Africa &apos;s farmers produce roughly one-third or less food per hectare of farmland than their counterparts around the world , resulting in massive hunger , which is exacerbated by a heavy disease burden . 
Malaria poses a unique challenge , owing in large part to Africa &apos;s mosquito species , which are especially adept at transmitting the disease . 
Other tropical parasitic diseases imply similarly extraordinary burdens in Africa . 
Add the practical difficulties of broken-down roads and few cars and trucks , and economic isolation follows . 
So the challenges of survival are enormous . 
Yet practical solutions are at hand , because simple and low-cost technologies can address specific problems . 
Low farm yields can be addressed through improved seed varieties specially adapted for African conditions , combined with technologies for replenishing soil and managing water . 
Malaria can be controlled through newly designed long-lasting mosquito nets and a new generation of effective medicines . 
Other tropical diseases also can be controlled , and practical technologies for safe drinking water can dramatically reduce diarrheal diseases . 
Mobile phones , local wireless Internet , and more paved roads could do much to break the economic isolation of Africa &apos;s villages . 
Donor countries incessantly ask Africans to change their trade policies , government institutions , public administration , and more . 
Some of these changes are important , but the role of the rich countries has been lopsided , focusing on everything except how to finance and introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems . 
The rich countries &quot; mistakes wouldn &apos;t matter if African countries had enough money to adopt the needed technologies on their own , but Africa is so poor that it must get financial help to escape poverty . 
The development challenges in Africa are just one example of how tough societal problems can be addressed by the design and spread of improved technologies . 
The same will be true of how the world best addresses manmade climate change - another of those seemingly intractable global problems . 
Right now , rich countries are changing the world &apos;s climate by emitting billions of tons of carbon dioxide each year from the use of coal , oil , and natural gas . 
In future years , China and India also will make massive contributions to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . 
Yet no country , rich or poor , is keen to cut its energy use , owing to concern that to do so would threaten jobs , incomes , and economic growth . 
New technologies will provide a key part of the solution . 
Already , &quot; hybrid &quot; automobiles , which combine gasoline and battery power , can roughly double fuel efficiency , cutting carbon dioxide emissions by half . 
Similarly , engineers have developed ways to capture the carbon dioxide that results from burning coal in power plants and store it safely underground . 
This new technology , called &quot; carbon capture and sequestration , &quot; can cut by 80 % the carbon dioxide emitted during the production of electricity . 
The costs appear relatively small . 
Consider also the depletion of ocean fisheries through over-fishing . 
Global demand for fish consumption is growing , and so , too , is the global capacity to catch fish , driving some species to the point of extinction . 
Improved aquaculture , in which fish are grown at manmade fishponds and reservoirs is still far from being a perfect technology , mainly for environmental reasons , yet it is enormously promising . 
On a recent visit to Africa , a senior agricultural scientist said that in today &apos;s world , the scientist is closer than ever before to the farmer , but farther away than ever from the policymakers . 
Politicians don &apos;t understand science , and rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers in addressing major issues . 
Everything is viewed as politics and votes , not as technical problems requiring technological expertise , which is why Africa &apos;s poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than to ecological challenges . 
It is easy to dismiss the suggestion that technology can save the day . 
After all , technological advance also requires good governance , market forces , effective universities , and more . 
Politics will still play its role . 
Nevertheless , it &apos;s time to recognize that governments are ill-equipped to understand the sophisticated technological challenges and opportunities facing the world , and that new ways are needed to ensure that science and technology are given the prominence needed to address a wide range of increasingly urgent global problems . 
Now is the time for every major international agency and national government to assume responsibility for gaining the scientific and technological expertise that they will need in the twenty-first century .
