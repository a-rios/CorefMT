South Korea &apos;s Feminine Future 
SEOUL - Over the last half-century , South Korea has made considerable economic progress , with per capita income increasing from a mere $ 80 dollars in 1960 to more than $ 22,000 last year . 
But its potential for sustained growth is faltering , owing to the imminent decline of its working-age population - projected to fall by 25 % by 2050 - and rising competition from China and other emerging economies . 
In order to improve its prospects , South Korea must pursue economic reform and restructuring , with an emphasis on maximizing its human-capital resources - especially women . 
South Korea &apos;s success over the last five decades owes much to the rapid growth of its well-educated labor force . 
From 1960 to 2010 , the share of adults with a secondary education soared from 20 % to an impressive 87 % . 
By boosting productivity , increasing returns on investment , and facilitating technological adaption and innovation , South Korea &apos;s abundance of well-educated workers has served as the foundation for its export-oriented development strategy . 
But women remain underutilized , to the detriment of the entire economy . 
Indeed , any effective South Korean growth strategy must create more and better economic opportunities for women , in part by establishing more accommodating working environments and instituting a more diverse and flexible education system . 
To its credit , South Korea has built a relatively gender-equal society . 
The gender gap in enrollment in both secondary and higher education is very small ; and women &apos;s access to elite positions in law , medicine , and the civil service has increased considerably in recent years . 
The country elected its first female president , Park Geun-hye , in 2012 . 
But a significant gender gap remains in terms of the return on human capital . 
According to OECD data , only 55 % of South Korean women aged 15-64 are in the labor force , compared to an average of 65 % in the advanced economies . 
South Korea &apos;s male labor-force participation rate , by contrast , stands at about 77 % - close to the OECD average of 79 % . 
Women who have completed secondary or tertiary education are more likely to enter and remain in the labor market than their less educated counterparts . 
The labor-participation rate for women with post-secondary education is 64 % , far exceeding the 35 % rate for those with only a primary or middle-school education . 
But , even for South Korea &apos;s most highly educated and capable female workers , child rearing is a major career obstacle . 
In fact , South Korean women participate in the labor force at roughly the average rate for the OECD while they are in their late twenties . 
The problem is that the rate drops sharply from 71 % to 57 % among women in their 30 &quot; s , as inflexible working environments and a lack of affordable childcare undermine their ability to continue investing in their careers . 
The good news is that Park &apos;s government is working to change this . 
Indeed , its three-year plan for economic innovation , announced in February , aims to raise the female employment rate to 62 % by 2017 , through the provision of affordable , high-quality childcare facilities and expanded paid parental leave , among other measures . 
But it is less clear how the government will create additional jobs for women . 
It could , for example , split full-time jobs into multiple part-time positions , and offer incentives for workers to reduce their hours . 
But , given that South Korea &apos;s workforce already includes a substantial share of non-regular workers , increasing temporary employment may not contribute to economic growth . 
A better approach would entail creating high-quality jobs in modern service industries . 
As it stands , while the services sector accounts for more than 70 % of employment in South Korea , its productivity-growth rate remains much lower than that of the manufacturing sector . 
Too many people are working in traditional , low-productivity service industries , such as wholesale , retail trade , and restaurants , leaving modern , high-productivity services like communications , health , financial intermediation , and business services underdeveloped . 
It is also important to narrow the mismatch between women &apos;s abilities and their career paths . 
The current system tends to reinforce gender roles , encouraging children to follow culturally framed paths , instead of nurturing their individual interests and potential . 
For example , female university students are much more likely to study humanities than the so-called &quot; STEM &quot; subjects ( science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ) - key drivers of productivity gains , innovation , and economic growth . 
Efforts by primary and secondary schools could help to foster more diverse interests among female students , giving talented young women the tools they need to make important contributions to key economic sectors . 
Of course , the potential of educated , empowered women to drive sustained economic growth is not limited to South Korea . 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , too , has identified increased female labor-force participation as critical to efforts to revive his country &apos;s long-dormant economy . 
In South Korea , Japan , and elsewhere , developing and maximizing women &apos;s potential will require comprehensive education and labor-market reforms , as well as structural change , particularly on the services side of the economy . 
The question is whether political leaders are ready to back their lofty pronouncements with decisive action .
