Is Academic Freedom Worth Its Price ? 
WARWICK , UK - Is academic freedom affordable in a time of economic crisis ? 
That was the topic for discussion at the annual signing of the Magna Charta Universitatum at the mother of universities , the University of Bologna , earlier this year . 
The Magna Charta is the world &apos;s most visible statement of principles for the promotion and protection of university autonomy . 
Over the past two decades , nearly 700 institutions of higher education on every continent have signed it . 
Nevertheless , there remains a nagging sense that universities are luxuries now that ordinary people are struggling to make ends meet . 
There has always been reason for concern . 
In the past , universities have been created in times of plenty , typically to encourage people to think beyond their immediate need for survival to more edifying spiritual or national goals . 
Nearly 50 years ago , a statistically minded historian of science , Derek de Solla Price , observed that the best indicator of academic research production is a nation &apos;s energy consumption per capita : both grow together . 
This is hardly surprising . 
From a strictly economic standpoint , academic freedom requires relative immunity to costs , whether stemming from trial-and-error experimentation or from more radical challenges to the status quo . 
But should universities now reduce their demands in order to meet the needs of the larger society , not least in terms of their carbon footprint ? 
If universities are to remain universities in the sense originally laid down by the Bolognese lawyers , the answer is no . 
Moreover , this is not an affront to economics . 
The efficiency savings of academia occur downstream from the activities of the universities themselves . 
Indeed , universities may be the most consistently performing products of long-term capital investment , especially if one is inclined to think about social and economic &quot; investment &quot; in exactly the same terms . 
After all , the university &apos;s unique institutional mission is to manufacture knowledge as a public good . 
The new knowledge produced by original research is an instance of social capital formation . 
It results from academics and funders collaborating on projects that aim to increase the competitive advantage of each in their respective domains . 
Left at this stage , knowledge is simply intellectual property , access to which is restricted to paying customers . 
But universities also have an institutional mandate to teach . 
Joseph Schumpeter &apos;s phrase &quot; creative destruction , &quot; his definition of entrepreneurship , aptly describes this process . 
Once teaching reduces , if not eliminates , the original competitive advantage associated with a piece of research , academics and their funders are forced to seek new sources of advantage by producing new knowledge . 
In the process , the larger public - those not involved in the original production of new knowledge - benefit through classroom instruction . 
In this sense , the heart of the university is located in its curriculum committee , as the mechanism by which research is regularly translated into teaching , generating new cycles of creative destruction . 
Efficiency-minded knowledge managers nowadays say that the very idea of the university as a place where the same people produce and distribute knowledge is a throwback to the Middle Ages . 
Today , teaching is thus said to be more efficiently delivered on-line , and research best delivered through dedicated &quot; science parks . &quot; 
But , while the sense of &quot; efficiency &quot; that attracted the mendicant Christian orders , the Dominicans and Franciscans , to staff the original universities was rather different , it is no less relevant today . 
The Dominicans and Franciscans literally lived by begging - that is , by depending on diverse sources of income , whose return to any particular investor was always unclear . 
The autonomy of these orders rested on a proven long-term ability to do more than expected with what they were given . 
The Latin word for this ability was povertas , or &quot; poverty &quot; in English . 
While the word does not retain its original virtuous connotations , we still warm to the virtuosity of &quot; doing more with less . &quot; 
In the case of the university , this means allowing access to knowledge to students who lack the intellectual , political , or financial resources that might have enabled them to produce it for themselves . 
Universities perform their natural economic function when academics speak and write plainly , demystify jargon , present their ideas in alternative media and stress applications to domains that do not concern the academics themselves . 
In these ways , academics enable knowledge to do maximum work at minimal cost to its recipients . 
In short , universities prove their worth if students find it easier to appropriate academic knowledge than the academics themselves originally did .
