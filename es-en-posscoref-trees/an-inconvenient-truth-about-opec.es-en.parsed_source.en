An Inconvenient Truth about OPEC 
DALLAS - The three major organizations that forecast long-term oil demand and supply - the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , and the United States Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) - along with oil companies and consulting firms , believe that OPEC will reconcile predicted global demand and non-OPEC supply . 
But they are wrong : OPEC output will not meet such projections , because they are based on flawed and outdated forecasting models . 
In forecasts that carry forward to the 2030 &quot; s , the three organizations share the view that world energy demand will increase , that developing countries will account for most of the increase , and that fossil fuel will remain dominant . 
They also agree that dependence on oil from OPEC members will increase as non-OPEC oil resources dwindle and become more expensive to extract . 
But a major flaw in modeling world oil markets makes these forecasts as unrealistic as a projection that humans will land on Mars tomorrow . 
Current forecasting models project world oil demand based on variables such as economic growth ( or income ) , oil prices , the price of oil substitutes , and past demand . 
They also project non-OPEC output using variables such as oil prices , production costs , and past supply . 
But , after forecasting world demand and non-OPEC supply , these models simply assume that OPEC will supply the rest - without taking into account OPEC behavior or considering that OPEC members might not be willing or able to meet the &quot; residual &quot; demand . 
For this reason , these models estimate what is known as the &quot; call on OPEC , &quot; the difference between estimated world demand and estimated non-OPEC supply . 
The idea to model the &quot; call on OPEC &quot; gained ground after the October oil embargo of 1973 , a time when few economists were familiar with the oil market . 
The magnitude of the energy crisis attracted economists from a wide array of specialties . 
To diagnose the problem , they opened their tool kit and used what was available : if the supply-and-demand model did not work , then the monopoly model would . 
Economists , politicians , and the media thus found the term &quot; cartel &quot; to be highly convenient . 
According to the monopoly model , the cartel would always supply the difference between total demand and the output supplied by non-cartel members . 
Although the situation has changed drastically since the early 1970 &quot; s , and the cartel model has been proved wrong and harmful , it is still used today . 
According to the model &apos;s main assumption - , OPEC will always produce the difference between world demand and non-OPEC production . But OPEC ran out of spare capacity between 2005 and early 2008 and was not able to increase production as demand increased . Prices skyrocketed and exceeded all earlier forecasts 
It is nearly impossible for OPEC members to produce the difference between estimated world demand and non-OPEC supply . 
For example , in its recent forecast , the EIA &apos;s base-case scenario is that , by 2035 , OPEC will add about 11 million barrels of oil a day ( mb / d ) to its 2010 output . 
Is this possible when production is declining at a rate of at least 3 % ? 
Let &apos;s check the math : at a 3 % rate of decline , OPEC needs to add an additional 17 mb / d by 2035 just to maintain 2010 production . 
If the EIA forecasts OPEC production to increase by about 11 mb / d , OPEC needs to add about 28 mb / d in the next 25 years , a feat that it has never accomplished - indeed , current production capacity is similar to that of the mid-1970 &quot; s . 
The situation gets worse if non-OPEC production declines below forecasts ; oil prices must increase substantially in order to ration demand and reconcile it with lower supply . 
Five factors prevent the projected &quot; call on OPEC &quot; from being met : 
· A shift in investment from oil to natural gas in oil-producing countries ; 
· Rising domestic oil consumption - and thus lower oil exports - by OPEC countries ; 
· The reaction of oil-producing countries to the rhetoric of energy independence in consuming countries , which has led to their developing energy-intensive industries that reduce oil and gas exports . 
Producing countries believe that if they cannot export oil to consuming nations , they can at least export the oil embedded in energy intensive products such as petrochemicals ; 
· Lack of &quot; investment absorptive capacity &quot; at high oil prices ( the local economy &apos;s ability to absorb investment ) , which makes OPEC members unwilling to produce more oil . 
If OPEC nations cannot invest the additional oil revenues , then they might prefer to keep oil in the ground ; 
· Most importantly , demand for new production to compensate for 3 % rates of decline in OPEC &apos;s oil fields is so huge that it cannot be met in less than 20-25 years ; 
· The inability to meet the expected &quot; call on OPEC &quot; and the higher prices resulting from shortages will create excellent opportunities for international oil companies , independent producers , and private-equity investors . 
It will also create an opportunity for other energy sources to fill the gap that OPEC members were expected to fill but did not . 
Indeed , given the expected growth in energy demand in the next two decades , and the possible - even likely - shortfall in OPEC supply relative to the projected &quot; call on OPEC , &quot; the term &quot; alternative energy &quot; will lose its meaning . 
The only &quot; alternative &quot; to harnessing all feasible energy sources will be a slow-growth world of permanent shortages and increasing misery .
