An External Stability Pact for Europe 
BERLIN - The current economic crisis has exposed two fundamental problems in the design of the European Monetary Union . 
The first concerns the sustainability of public finances in a number of euro-zone member states . 
Second , inadequate macroeconomic policy coordination has resulted in divergences in the international competitiveness of euro-zone members , threatening the very existence of the euro . 
Countries whose public finances seemed fundamentally sound as late as last year have come under severe fiscal pressure . 
Ireland &apos;s government debt is expected to rise to almost 80 % of GDP by 2010 , whereas just a year ago the European Commission projected that Ireland &apos;s government debt would be below 30 % of GDP . 
Likewise , whereas Spain was expected to decrease its debt ratio , its debt-to-GDP ratio is now likely to double between 2007 and 2010 , to more than 60 % . 
The EU &apos;s fiscal surveillance mechanisms failed to predict these developments because they neglect a crucial variable : the dynamics of private-sector debt . 
Given the high economic costs of a banking crisis , governments are likely to take on the liabilities of their financial sector when a crisis hits - as recently occurred in the United Kingdom and Ireland , and in financial crises in Latin America and Asia in the 1990 &quot; s . 
The same is probably true when key business sectors near insolvency . 
A country with sound public finances can thus become a fiscal basket case practically overnight . 
Given the increasingly close financial and economic linkages between euro-zone members , rising government debt in even one EMU country can have serious consequences for all members , because no member state will allow another to default . 
Thus , EMU members indirectly share the liability for fellow countries &quot; private-sector debt , which for this reason should be monitored within the EMU &apos;s surveillance framework . 
Another apparent problem is that EMU member states - at least until now - do not coordinate their economic policies effectively . 
Even before the crisis , this resulted in divergences in competitiveness and in the business cycle . 
The persistent loss in competitiveness over the past decade is one reason why the crisis is hitting some southern European EMU countries such as Spain and Italy so hard . 
The inefficiency of fiscal-policy control and the lack of economic convergence are a matter of increasing concern to both the European Central Bank and euro-zone finance ministers . 
While no initiative for coping with these problems has been tabled so far , the issue is certain to become a matter of debate within the EMU . 
One way to tackle the problems associated with government debt , as well as to improve economic policy coordination , is through a simple extension of existing rules : an &quot; External Stability Pact &quot; could be introduced to complement current EMU regulations . 
This pact would monitor current-account imbalances and penalize excessive deficits or surpluses in the external account . 
Monitoring external balances can be an effective tool to measure future default risks , since sustained current-account deficits lead to a growth in net foreign debt . 
Moreover , there is a direct relationship between the EMU countries &quot; private-sector debt dynamics and their current-account imbalances within the euro zone . 
So long as a national government is not running more than a modest deficit , a current-account deficit reflects the private sector &apos;s borrowing from abroad ( or the sale of previously accumulated foreign assets ) . 
If the current-account balance is assessed together with the fiscal position , it becomes possible to draw conclusions about risky debt trends within the private sector . 
The mathematics of debt dynamics suggest that no euro-zone country should have a current-account imbalance , whether a deficit or a surplus , of more than 3 % of GDP . 
Exceptions could be granted for countries with large inflows of foreign direct investment in greenfield projects . 
The rule should apply both to debtor and creditor countries . 
After all , payment imbalances always have two sides , and the burden of adjustment should not be borne only by deficit countries . 
Such a pact would oblige governments to use fiscal and wage policies as well as overall economic policy to achieve external balance . 
It would also lead to broader economic-policy coordination , particularly with respect to wage-setting , because governments would be compelled to use national legislation and public-sector wage settlements to influence wage policy in such a way that imbalances among euro-zone countries are reduced . 
Furthermore , an External Stability Pact would oblige governments to take into account the consequences for other member states when designing national economic reforms . 
If a &quot; surplus country &quot; such as Germany wanted to lower non-wage labor costs and increase value-added tax in order to boost its competitiveness , it would simultaneously have to adopt an expansive fiscal policy to compensate for the negative effects on its partners &quot; foreign trade . 
Within the framework of these rules , individual countries would retain the authority to design their policies . 
The Spanish government , for example , could have met Spain &apos;s building boom and foreign-trade deficit with tax increases or by urging domestic wage restraint . 
Alternatively , it could have intervened by instituting planning regulations or imposing limits on mortgage loans . 
An External Stability Pact would not only detect risks to fiscal stability early on ; it would also help make a reality of a fundamental principle of EU law , namely that member states finally treat economic policy as a &quot; common interest . &quot;
