Health Care &apos;s Voyage 
One of the most important efforts in health care research over the next decade will be to integrate advances in biology , material sciences , and chemical and bioengineering to create a revolutionary new generation of medical devices and drug delivery systems . 
Indeed , the main challenge facing researchers in these diverse fields may not be a lack of scientific progress , but rather a shortage of adequate interdisciplinary training . 
A key area for research will involve tissue engineering , which generally involves combining the cells of mammals ( including stem cells ) with polymer-materials to create new tissues or organs . 
It is now estimated that nearly half a nation &apos;s health care costs can be attributed to tissue loss or organ failure . 
The ability to create new livers , spinal cords , hearts , kidneys , and many other tissues or organ-based systems could radically decrease hospitalization time , relieve suffering , and prolong life . 
The challenges here are , of course , huge . 
In particular , an appropriate source must be found for producing a large enough supply of differentiated cells quickly enough . 
Stem cells represent a potentially important potential source , but problems in controlling their differentiation and growth must first be overcome , as must rejection by the human immune system . 
Another path to be pursued involves the development of micro-electrical mechanical systems ( MEMS ) that can be used in drug delivery . 
These microdevices would be made of silicon or other materials that can be loaded with drugs ( or sensors ) and covered with caps made of gold or other substances . 
An electrical signal to the implant would dissolve the gold cover to release the drug . 
Such systems have the potential to deliver new kinds of drugs in complex regimens which might be useful for cancer chemotherapy , for example . 
They could also provide new means of localized drug delivery that might be useful in several areas , including delivery of multiple drugs . 
Finally , such systems might also create new opportunities for bio-sensing devices that could be placed on a computer chip . 
New kinds of biomaterials for medical devices are also on the horizon . 
Currently , most biomaterials are off-the-shelf materials that were originally used in consumer applications . 
For example , the material in the artificial heart was originally used to make girdles for women . 
Some breast implant materials were originally used in mattress stuffing . 
A potentially important area here is the development of materials that have a &quot; shape memory . &quot; 
For example , a surgeon might place something like a string 
Another potential use for such materials might be self-tying sutures that could be employed in minimally invasive surgery . 
New materials will also be necessary to overcome one of the main obstacles to successful gene therapy : the absence of appropriate delivery systems . 
While viruses are a highly efficient means , they pose safety risks . 
Likewise , the non-invasive delivery of complex molecules such as peptides or proteins remains a major challenge . 
Currently such molecules are given by injection . 
New advances in engineering medicine may help in targeting drugs at specific cells , particularly cancer cells , which has been extremely difficult to do for several reasons . 
One challenge is to design micro or nano particles that can travel throughout the bloodstream without being absorbed by other cells along the way . 
If that can be accomplished , &quot; magic bullets &quot; to fight cancer , heart disease , and other disorders might someday be possible . 
All of these looming changes will likely have an enormous impact on drug development and diagnostics . 
However , developing and exploiting the full array of potential new disease-fighting weapons will require outstanding scientists and engineers , including those with interdisciplinary training .
