The Case for the TPP 
STANFORD - Following the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership by 12 Pacific Rim countries , debates about the costs and benefits of trade liberalization are intensifying . 
The early leaders in the United States &quot; presidential campaign , both the Republican Donald Trump and the Democrat Hillary Clinton , have expressed opposition to the TPP , though as Secretary of State , Clinton called it the &quot; the gold standard of trade deals . &quot; 
The right level of trade openness is not a new debate . 
Historically , trade systems have ranged from rather open to severely restricted by rules , tariffs , or non-tariff barriers , driven by shifts in the relative strength of liberalizing or protectionist economic and political forces . 
But even in closed systems , however severe the penalties they impose on trade , black markets usually develop , owing to the &quot; gains from trade &quot; generated by natural economic forces . 
The desire to trade arises whenever the domestic benefits of importing a good ( whether a finished product or component ) exceed the price paid - for example , if the imported good cannot be produced domestically , or only at a higher cost . 
As the British economist David Ricardo demonstrated two centuries ago , it can even be better for a country to import goods that it can produce more cheaply , if doing so enables the production of other goods that are still cheaper to produce . 
Additional gains from trade include increased variety and the economies of scale implied by producing for global markets . 
Of course , there are potential downsides to trade . 
Alexander Hamilton , the first US treasury secretary , argued that allowing lower-cost imports would impede the development of domestic &quot; infant &quot; industry , which needed time to scale up enough to reduce costs to a competitive level . 
In recent decades , the anti-trade argument has focused largely on &quot; unfair &quot; competition and economic dislocation . 
But the reality is that , if two sides willingly trade , it can be assumed that both are better off ; otherwise , one of them would refuse to trade . 
So , while trade liberalization may entail some ( smaller ) losses for certain groups , these can - and should - be addressed through domestic relocation and assistance schemes , such as America &apos;s Trade Adjustment Assistance program , and transition rules for affected industries , firms , and workers . 
Past experience reinforces the view that , ultimately , voluntary trade is a good thing . 
Extreme protectionism in the early 1930s , following an era of relatively free international trade , had devastating consequences , ultimately setting the stage for World War II . 
As the MIT economist Charles Kindleberger showed , America &apos;s Smoot-Hawley Tariff , in particular , helped to turn a deep recession into a global depression . 
Even before the war was over , major powers convened in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire , to establish a new international trade and finance regime , including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . 
Through a succession of lengthy and difficult global negotiations - the so-called &quot; GATT rounds &quot; - tariffs were steadily lowered for an increasing variety of goods . 
As a result , global trade grew faster than world GDP for most of the post-war period . 
Virtually all economists agree that this shift toward freer trade greatly benefited the world &apos;s citizens and enhanced global growth . 
The economists Jeffrey Frankel and David Romer estimate that , in general , trade has a sizeable positive effect on growth . 
At a time when growth is failing to meet expectations almost everywhere , the TPP thus seems like a good move . 
To be sure , because tariffs in the TPP member countries are already low ( with some exceptions , such as Canada &apos;s tariffs on dairy products and Japan &apos;s on beef ) , the net benefit of eliminating them would be modest ( except for a few items that are very sensitive to small price changes ) . 
But the TPP is also expected to reduce non-tariff barriers ( such as red tape and protection of state enterprises ) ; harmonize policies and procedures ; and include dispute-settlement mechanisms . 
Though the TPP &apos;s precise provisions have not been made public , political leaders in the member countries predict that the deal , once ratified and implemented , will add hundreds of billions of dollars to their economies and bolster employment . 
Smaller and developing economies will probably gain the most , relative to size , but everyone will benefit overall . 
Other important outcomes are not included in these calculations . 
The alternative to liberalizing trade is not the status quo ; it is a consistent move away from openness . 
This can occur in a number of ways , such as the erection of non-tariff barriers that favor domestic incumbents at the expense of lower-priced potential imports that would benefit consumers . 
Moreover , it is much easier to build mutually beneficial trade relationships than it is to resolve military and geopolitical issues , such as combating the Islamic State or resolving tensions in the South China Sea . 
But strong trade relationships have the potential to encourage cooperation - or , at least , discourage escalation of conflict - in other , more contentious areas . 
Still , there are some legitimate concerns about the TPP . 
Some worry that it could divert trade from non-member countries or undermine the moribund Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations ( though 20 years ago , the North American Free Trade Agreement had the opposite effect , kick-starting the Uruguay round ) . 
Given all of this - not to mention renewed attention to national borders , owing to contentious immigration issues , such as the influx of Middle Eastern refugees in Europe - the TPP &apos;s ratification is far from certain , especially in the US . 
The concentrated interests that oppose the agreement may turn out to be more influential than the diffuse interests of all consumers . 
That would be a major loss . 
Allowing existing protectionist trade barriers to remain in place - or worsen - would not only deprive citizens in TPP countries of higher incomes ; it would also deal a damaging blow to international cooperation .
