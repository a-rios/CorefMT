America &apos;s Bond-Market Blues 
BEIJING - The market for United States Treasury securities is one of the world &apos;s largest and most active debt markets , providing investors with a secure stock of value and a reliable income stream , while helping to lower the US government &apos;s debt-servicing costs . 
This dumping of US government debt by foreign investors heralds the end of an era of cheap financing for the US . 
As it stands , the US government holds roughly 40 % of its debt through the Federal Reserve and government agencies like the Social Security Trust Fund , while American and foreign investors hold 30 % each . 
Emerging economies - many of which use large trade surpluses to drive GDP growth and supplement their foreign-exchange reserves with the resulting capital inflows - are leading buyers of US debt . 
Over the last decade , these countries &quot; foreign-exchange reserves have swelled from $ 750 billion to $ 6.3 trillion - more than 50 % of the global total - providing a major source of financing that has effectively suppressed long-term US borrowing costs . 
But the ongoing depreciation of the US dollar - which has fallen by almost half since the Bretton Woods system collapsed in 1971 - together with the rising volume of US government debt , undermines the purchasing power of investors in US government securities . 
Nowhere is this more problematic than in China , which , despite the recent sell-off , remains by far America &apos;s largest foreign creditor , accounting for more than 22 % of America &apos;s foreign-held debt . 
Chinese demand for Treasuries has enabled the US to increase its government debt almost threefold over the last decade , from roughly $ 6 trillion to $ 16.7 trillion . 
This , in turn , has fueled a roughly 28 % annual expansion in China &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves . 
China &apos;s purchases of American debt effectively transferred the official reserves gained via China &apos;s trade surplus back to the US market . 
In early 2000 , China held only $ 71.4 billion of US debt and accounted for 8 % of total foreign investment in the US . 
But China &apos;s reserves have long suffered as a result , yielding only 2 % on US ten-year bonds , when they should be yielding 3-5 % . 
Meanwhile , outward foreign direct investment yields 20 % annually , on average . 
So , whereas China &apos;s $ 3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves will yield only about $ 100 billion annually , its $ 1.53 trillion in foreign direct investment could bring in annual returns totaling around $ 300 billion . 
Despite such low returns , China has continued to invest its reserves in the US , largely owing to the inability of its own under-developed financial market to generate a sufficient supply of safe assets . 
In the first four months of this year , China added $ 44.3 billion of US Treasury securities to its reserves , meaning that such debt now accounts for 38 % of China &apos;s total foreign-exchange reserves . 
But the growing risk associated with US Treasury bonds should prompt China to reduce its holdings of US debt . 
The US Federal Reserve &apos;s announcement in May that it may wind down its quantitative easing ( QE ) program - that is , large-scale purchases of long-term financial assets - by the end of this year has sparked fears of a 1994-style bond-market collapse . 
Concerns that a sharp rise in interest rates will cause the value of bond portfolios to plummet have contributed to the recent wave of foreign investors dumping US debt - a trend that is likely to continue to the extent that the Fed follows through on its exit from QE . 
Yields on ten-year US bonds are now 2.94 % , a 58 % increase since the first quarter of this year , causing the interest-rate gap between two- and ten-year bonds to widen to 248 basis points . 
According to the Congressional Budget Office , the yield rate on ten-year bonds will continue to rise , reaching 5 % by 2019 and remaining at or above that level for the next five years . 
While it is unlikely that this will lead to a 1994-style disaster , especially given that the current yield rate remains very low by historical standards , it will destabilize the US debt market . 
For China , the benefits of holding large quantities of US dollars no longer outweigh the risks , so it must begin to reduce the share of US securities in its foreign-exchange reserves . 
Given that China will reduce the overall size of its reserves as its population ages and its economic-growth model shifts toward domestic consumption , a substantial sell-off of US debt is inevitable - and , with it , a large and permanent increase in America &apos;s financing costs .
