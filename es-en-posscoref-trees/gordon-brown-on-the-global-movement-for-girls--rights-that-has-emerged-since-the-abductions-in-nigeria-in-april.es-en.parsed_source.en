One Hundred Days of Servitude 
LONDON - Demonstrations around the world were held this week to mark the 100th day of captivity for more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls by the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram . 
Since their abduction in April , global outrage has not waned ; on the contrary , it has spurred a worldwide movement to uphold all girls &quot; basic rights . 
Campaigners from groups fighting child marriage , child trafficking , and child labor , and from groups demanding children &apos;s right to attend school , free of intimidation , have united in the past few days to show the strength of global opinion in favor of universal education and a world free of child slavery . 
But what is of greater long-term significance is that girls themselves are demanding that their rights be taken seriously . 
Girls have mobilized in Bangladesh , where the movement to establish child-marriage-free zones is growing ; in India , where the Global March Against Child Labor started ; and in Africa , where child protection clubs are being formed in almost every country . 
The first demand is that the Nigerian girls be returned safely to their homes and that schools in Nigeria are made safer and more secure from threats by Boko Haram ( whose name means &quot; Western education is a sin &quot; ) . 
France , the United Kingdom , the United States , China , and Israel have stepped up military and technical support , including the recent provision of helicopters and night-vision equipment for jungle warfare to fight the group , whose campaign of terror has cost 5,000 deaths in the past five years . 
In Nigeria alone , six million girls do not attend school ; around the world , ten million girls each year become child brides , and seven million school-age girls are full-time workers . 
We can no longer assume steady , if rocky , progress toward vindication of girls &quot; rights . 
Iraqi legislators are considering reducing the age for child marriage to nine . 
Pakistan &apos;s Council of Islamic Ideology is calling for all age limits on marriage to be abolished . 
And India has passed up another chance to outlaw child labor . 
The rising tide of adolescent rage at child marriage and child labor has yet to trend on Twitter and Facebook . 
And Bangladesh &apos;s child-marriage-free zone in the Nilphamari region , Indonesia &apos;s child-empowerment groups in the districts of Dompu and Grobogan , Uganda &apos;s child-rights clubs , and India &apos;s Bachpan Bachao Andolan , which combats child slavery , may not be household names . 
But the yawning gap between what girls are demanding and the opportunities on offer to them is fueling a liberation struggle led by girls themselves . 
Last month , on the &quot; Day of the African Child , &quot; thousands of young people marched on the streets of Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , and took over 20 African and Asian parliaments to demand universal education for girls . 
On July 23 , girls took to the streets in Pakistan , led by Baela Raza Jamil of Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi , which is campaigning for what the Nigerian schoolgirls have lost : the right to an education . 
In India , vigils making common cause with the Chibok girls were led by Bachpan Bachao Andolan , which every day rescues children from trafficking and slave labor . 
Girls Not Brides mobilized in 45 countries , reminding its 145 sister organizations around the world that many of the Chibok girls will meet the same fate as the girls they seek to protect . 
Increasingly , young people around the world see the connection between the abductions in Nigeria , the rape and murder of young girls in India , so-called &quot; honor killings &quot; of Pakistani girls who marry against their families &quot; wishes , genital mutilation of girls across Africa , and child-trafficking for full-time work , often in slave-labor conditions . 
Seven decades after the adoption by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , girls &quot; rights are still not taken seriously ; so girls are taking action to make themselves heard . 
And , slowly but surely , local embryonic civil-rights movements are linking up with global leaders - Girls Not Brides , Walk Free , and A World at School - as part of an emergency coalition to eliminate child labor , child marriage , and educational discrimination against girls . 
The timetable for doing so will be set out at the UN General Assembly in September in the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . 
Girls should be able to study in a classroom , free of fear and without the need to demonstrate on the streets . 
This is a basic right ; ensuring that it is respected cannot come soon enough .
