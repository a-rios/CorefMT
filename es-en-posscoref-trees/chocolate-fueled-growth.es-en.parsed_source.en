Chocolate-Fueled Growth 
VIENNA - As an African , my dream for the next decade is to see the continent producing and selling chocolate to 300 million Chinese , instead of exporting raw commodities like cocoa . 
Several weeks ago , at the China-Africa Symposium in Xiamen , China , I tested this vision on the audience , and the 2,000-plus delegates joined in resounding applause . 
Business and government leaders are evidently ready to see Africa introduce structural change aimed at creating manufacturing-based national economies . 
While many have touted Africa &apos;s success in maintaining a 5-6 % average GDP growth rate during the past decade , this masks the reality that by 2005 , sub-Saharan Africa was little better off than it was a quarter-century earlier : it was still the world &apos;s poorest region , with just over half of its population living on less than $ 1.25 a day in purchasing parity terms . 
The region &apos;s countries are on a poverty treadmill , running fast just to remain in the same position . 
This needs to change . 
The orthodox agriculture-led growth strategy of the 1960 &quot; s , the favored antidote to five decades of a &quot; happy peasant &quot; aid doctrine , must be replaced with an agribusiness development strategy whereby policymakers , donors , and entrepreneurs target the entire value chain to support a shift from bulk products to value-added , agro-industrial manufactured products . 
Several years ago , James Wolfensohn , the late World Bank president , describing a new international order , described a &quot; four-speed world &quot; : the affluent , the converging , the struggling , and the poor . 
Converging countries are closing the gap with the affluent OECD countries ; struggling countries have failed to progress from middle-income status ; and poor countries - most of them in Africa - are mired in extreme poverty . 
The good news is that since the 1990 &quot; s , the number of poor countries in Africa has fallen from 35 to 21 , and the number of converging economies has increased from two to 17 . 
But 13 of the latter are either dependent on oil exports ( Angola , Chad , Equatorial Guinea , Nigeria , and Sudan ) , or mineral exports ( Botswana , Ghana , Mozambique , Namibia , Sierra Leone , South Africa , and Tanzania ) . 
Moreover , the new realities of the unfolding global economic crisis that started in 2008 suggest that the North-South flow of capital , aid , and finance of the past 50 years will not continue . 
But it is also clear that by 2030 , today &apos;s emerging markets will account for 60 % of global GDP and 40 % of the world &apos;s consumer spending . 
Justin Lin , Vice-President and Chief Economist of the World Bank , speaking recently in Mozambique , encouraged African countries to take advantage of the &quot; emergence of large middle-income countries such as China , India , and Brazil . &quot; 
They should position themselves to capture from China &quot; 100 million labor-intensive manufacturing jobs ; enough to more than quadruple manufacturing employment in low-income countries . &quot; 
Can Africa position itself in the global economy to produce and sell finished goods , especially processed foods and agricultural products ? 
Can the continent break the North-South commodity-based pattern of trade , and inaugurate a pattern of South-North-South triangular trade based on higher-value products ? 
Working with leading experts like Tony Hawkins of the University Of Zimbabwe Graduate School Of Business , the United Nations Industrial Development Organization has formulated a roadmap to accelerate Africa &apos;s agribusiness revolution . 
It calls for enhancing agricultural productivity ; upgrading value chains ; exploiting local , regional , and international demand ; strengthening technological effort and innovation capabilities ; promoting effective and innovative financing ; stimulating private participation ; and improving infrastructure and energy access . 
An agribusiness development strategy focused on higher-value output and stronger productivity growth throughout the value chain represents one of the best opportunities for rapid and broad-based economic growth and wealth creation in Africa . 
It also may be one of the few local pathways out of poverty for small farmers . 
Africa still has limited agro-processing activity and capacity in rural areas . 
As a result , sub-Saharan countries experience up to 40 % post-harvest losses , especially for perishable commodities such as fruit and vegetables . 
In other words , almost half of what is produced on Africa &apos;s farms rots there , while the vast majority of the population goes to bed hungry . 
I have seen this happen in Plateau and Benue States ( supposedly the breadbasket of Nigeria ) , and in villages and towns in my home country , Sierra Leone . 
The average chemical fertilizer use in sub-Saharan Africa is 12.5 kilograms per hectare of arable land , compared to the world average of 102 kg / hectare . 
Similarly the agriculture sector is under-capitalized , with extremely low levels of mechanization : an average of 13 tractors per 100 square kilometers compared to 129 per square kilometer in South Asia . 
Only 10 % of Africa &apos;s hydropower potential is exploited , compared to 70-80 % in OECD countries . 
By 2030 , more than 50 % of Africa &apos;s 1.4 billion inhabitants are expected to live in cities . 
Urbanization brings with it opportunity , as consumer demand will most likely shift towards higher-value processed foods , including fruit , vegetables , vegetable oils , fish , and dairy products . 
Thanks to skillful marketing , an Indonesian company convinced millions of Nigerians in just five years to consume an instant-noodle product , known as Indomie , instead of the popular cassava product called Garri . 
There is no immovable reason why Africa countries - and companies - cannot do the same thing . 
But that requires adopting a new mantra for eradicating poverty , eliminating hunger , and creating wealth : from cocoa to chocolate , from cotton to garments , and from bauxite to aluminum .
