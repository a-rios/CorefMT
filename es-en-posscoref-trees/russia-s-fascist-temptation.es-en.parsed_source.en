Russia &apos;s Fascist Temptation 
Today &apos;s Kremlin thinks that democracy was being built too quickly in Russia . 
The government does not say that it is against democracy , only that it is untimely and needs to be delayed - a logic that manifests itself in most official decisions . 
Thus , at the beginning of the current decade , the democratic system of political checks and balances that had been created in the 1990 &quot; s began to be dismantled . 
Before 2000 , there was an influential , independent press and a parliament loyal to the president , but still independent . 
The Federation Council ( the upper chamber of the Duma ) , too , was generally loyal to the president , as were regional governors , while remaining independent . 
There were also influential entrepreneurs and business organizations that were actively involved in the decision-making process . 
As a result of the disappearance of these checks and balances , the quality of the government &apos;s decisions has fallen sharply . 
The notorious law on monetization of social benefits , which transforms in-kind benefits into cash , is a typical example . 
Despite the fundamental soundness of the step , it was poorly prepared and implemented , and the government seriously miscalculated its effects on the national budget . 
Moreover , it generated mass social protests , which the government evidently had not envisaged . 
Never would the law in its current form have passed through the old State Duma . 
MP &apos;s would have read and analyzed it attentively , asked ministers many questions , and , if necessary , insisted on re-writing various tables presented in the draft . 
They would have understood that the calculations provided were at complete odds with reality , and they would have considered what to do about it . 
If there is no independent press able to caution against mistakes and a parliament that can do the same , then the mistakes will eventually manifest themselves on the streets . 
Democracy was not invented by fools . 
Experience tells us that if you don &apos;t let the steam out of a pot , the pot will explode . 
I would say that this is worse than a crime . 
It &apos;s a mistake . 
As someone with some background in politics , I understand the strategy of today &apos;s government : create an extreme threat , first and foremost through shadowy associations with fascist organizations , and then say to citizens , &quot; You can &apos;t deal with this threat on your own , so you should trust us to figure out what to do with it . &quot; 
The message is then constantly reinforced by the view of the world formed by the media . 
I understand the reality of the fascist threat , but I also understand what the government wants us to take from it . 
I firmly believe that we should not allow ourselves to participate in these games , nor that we should believe that Russia &apos;s fascist organizations don &apos;t have anything to do with the government . 
I think that when the authorities conceive such strategies , they assume that the outcome will be manageable . 
In reality , this is not always the case . 
When you open a Pandora &apos;s box , nobody can predict what will happen . 
It is very risky to create a dangerous situation for political ends , because , more often than not , it is likely that the situation will become uncontrollable . 
Indeed , the threat of fascism is real . 
The most important question of the day is not the government &apos;s perspective , that is , its desire to instill fear and eliminate checks and balances on its power . 
What matters are the actions of those who don &apos;t want fascism in Russia and instead simply want Russia to be free . 
There are many such people , tens of millions , but they are not always politically engaged and united . 
The good news , then , is that there are far fewer people who seriously want to see a fascist regime in Russia than the government claims . 
We should not lose heart , but we do need to be politically active and united . 
After all , the Soviet Union was a totalitarian state that could rely on a powerful and ubiquitous secret police .
