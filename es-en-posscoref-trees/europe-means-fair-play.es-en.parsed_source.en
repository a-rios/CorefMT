Europe Means Fair Play 
As Ukraine &apos;s agonizing struggle for democracy continues , Europeans wonder if the politics of principle can ever eclipse the politics of power . 
Is it naive to believe that the world amounts to more than zero-sum thinking ? 
Can Europe promote fair play in international affairs , or must it accept a new game of great power rivalry as inevitable and throw itself into the fray ? 
Many Europeans see themselves as champions of global fair play . 
One example is Russia , which is skeptical about the EU &apos;s intentions , most recently over Ukraine . 
That should not surprise us . 
The EU has expanded from six members to 25 , with Bulgaria , Romania , Croatia , and Turkey waiting in the wings . 
Russia wants to know where the Union will stop . 
Does it plan to swallow Ukraine , Belarus , and the Caucasus ? 
Most EU members view these as open questions , unlikely to be resolved soon . 
The Kremlin , however , seems to see in such vagueness a smokescreen hiding the Union &apos;s true intentions , though the recent EU-Russia summit provided an opportunity to clear the air . 
In a sense , critics of the EU are right : the Union may be on a quest to reshape the world in its image . 
Nowadays , when the EU concludes agreements with non-EU countries , it includes all sorts of stiff requirements in areas like human rights , non-proliferation , readmission of migrants , and terrorism . 
To countries on the receiving end , these conditions can seem like a subtle form of power politics , with Europe trying to impose its values on the world . 
Indeed , for the EU some issues are non-negotiable , because they are pillars of the European model that we seek to share with the world . 
These issues include democracy and the rule of law , respect for human rights and the environment , non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , and the campaign against terrorism . 
Countries cannot expect economic and other benefits from the Union unless they meet its political standards . 
But are those standards really an imposition ? 
It looks as if the principles of fair play are increasingly embraced outside of Europe . 
Consider Africa , where the African Union is taking a leading role in resolving conflicts on the continent and is increasingly determined to intervene to halt aggression and assure fair play for African minorities . 
Even if the results on the ground in Africa don &apos;t yet look spectacular to outsiders , the change in attitude is real . 
Instead of playing the &quot; Great Power Game &quot; in Africa , the EU can support Africans &quot; own efforts and allow them to benefit from the Union &apos;s experience . 
Europe &apos;s belief in fair play for all reflects its self-interest , at least in some ways , because the world &apos;s balance of power is changing . 
Consider the rise of China and India . 
The investment bank Goldman Sachs predicts that the dollar size of the Chinese economy will overtake that of Britain and Germany by 2007 . 
India will pull ahead of France by 2020 and surpass Germany by 2023 . 
As Asia &apos;s economies race forward , so do its political ambitions . 
Asians want to assume greater responsibility in the world , and it is in Europe &apos;s interest that they do , as long as they , too , respect the rules of fair play . 
A sense of fair play also matters within the Union . 
The larger the EU gets , the greater its need for coordinated and coherent policies , and the harder it becomes to rally all members around a common position . 
Call this the &quot; paradox of enlargement . &quot; 
The three largest member states - Britain , France , and Germany - have tended to respond to this paradox by pursuing closer trilateral cooperation . 
Of course , there &apos;s nothing wrong with vanguard groups of members forging ahead - the recent diplomatic initiative concerning Iran &apos;s nuclear program is a case in point . 
Indeed , every member state can be expected to cling to its right to pursue an independent foreign policy for the foreseeable future . 
However , to ensure that the European whole is greater than the sum of its parts , and to guarantee fairness to all Union members , all EU states must work within the parameters of EU policy , as they have in the case of Ukraine . 
When they do , their efforts strengthen the legitimacy and authority of both the member states and the Union . 
In a world of fair play , the flip side of rule making is compliance , and compliance may require enforcement , through economic sanctions and other non-military measures . 
As a last resort , the EU must even be prepared to rise to the military defense of the values and principles it believes are worth protecting . 
If Europe is not prepared to take up arms when it must , then its appeals for fair play will sound to the rest of the world like mere posturing . 
But if fair play is to be made global , European initiatives should be part of broader international efforts , involving both like-minded partners such as the United States and multilateral institutions . 
A divisive transatlantic rivalry offers no ethical or political basis for an enlightened European approach . 
On the contrary , fair play requires American power to back it up .
