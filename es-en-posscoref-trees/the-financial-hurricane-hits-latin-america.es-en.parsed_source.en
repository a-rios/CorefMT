The Financial Hurricane Hits Latin America 
LOS ANGELES - A few weeks ago , the world was on the edge of disaster . 
Fortunately , the decisive actions taken by the advanced countries &quot; monetary authorities - including provision of unprecedented amounts of liquidity - prevented a complete financial meltdown . 
The world has avoided the &quot; Argentinization &quot; of the international financial system . 
What has not been avoided is a recession that will be deep , long , and global . 
In the coming months , nearly every region in the world will experience economic deceleration , with exports declining and unemployment increasing . 
Recent events have disproved the notion that emerging nations had &quot; decoupled &quot; themselves from the advanced economies . 
The facts have shown the opposite to be true . 
Most emerging economies are still fragile and affected by what goes on in the advanced countries . 
The effects of this recession will be particularly severe in Latin America . 
Brazil and Mexico have been the hardest hit so far , to the point that the value of their firms has fallen by approximately 50 % . 
The situation in these countries is so serious that a few days ago the United States granted them credit for up to $ 60 billion . 
But Brazil and Mexico are not the only ones hit by financial volatility : Chile &apos;s currency has lost a third of its value , in Peru the cost of external financing has soared , and in Argentina the government has had to resort to extreme measures - such as the nationalization of the pension system - in order to avert an imminent fiscal calamity . 
Indeed , with the recession possibly lasting 18 months or more - which would make it the longest since World War II - Argentina will be one of the hardest hit . 
Its external financing needs are enormous , and its exports will fall sharply . 
But politics will also play a role in Argentina &apos;s economic distress . 
The administration of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner generates a great deal of distrust among local and foreign investors , who fear arbitrary measures . 
The recent decision of Standard and Poor &apos;s to lower Argentina &apos;s rating is fully justified and reflects many analysts &quot; fear that Argentina will again default on its public debt . 
Mexico and Central America will also suffer from the long recession . 
For many years , their economic fate has been closely tied to that of the US . 
These ties increased with the signing of bilateral free-trade treaties with the US , so there is a good chance that they could experience negative growth in 2009 and , perhaps , in the first half of 2010 , as the US goes into recession . 
Less affected by the financial crisis and the US recession will be those that have developed with an eye toward Asia nations - particularly Chile , Colombia , and Peru - , and have accumulated resources to meet unexpected financial storms . 
They will be quicker to recover their levels of employment . 
But the most important question is what will happen in Brazil , Latin America &apos;s giant . 
Over the past few years , analysts and investors around the world began to see Brazil as an economic power in the making . 
There was mention of a miracle , and many argued that Brazil would grow spectacularly like China and India , and no longer be the eternal country of &quot; the future . &quot; 
Unfortunately , everything suggests that this was an illusion based on wishful thinking . 
Brazil &apos;s boom of the past few years stood on an incredibly weak foundation . 
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva did indeed decide to avoid the rampant populism of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela , and successfully tackled inflation . 
But it takes more than that to become a great economic power . 
What Lula did was simply to decide that Brazil would be a &quot; normal &quot; country . 
But more than controlled inflation is needed to create a robust economy with a high and sustainable growth rate . 
Agility , dynamism , productivity , and economic policies that promote efficiency and enterprise are required . 
As many studies have shown , Brazil has not been able - or has not wanted - to adopt the modernizing reforms needed to promote a productivity boom . 
Brazil is still an enormously bureaucratic country , with an educational system in crisis , very high taxes , mediocre infrastructure , impediments to the creation of businesses , and a high level of corruption . 
It is sad but true : in recent years Brazil did not opt for modernization and efficiency and will have to pay the consequences during the difficult years ahead .
