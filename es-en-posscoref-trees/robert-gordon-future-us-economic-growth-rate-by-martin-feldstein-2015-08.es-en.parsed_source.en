Will Americans Become Poorer ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Robert Gordon of Northwestern University has launched a lively and important debate about the future rate of economic growth in the United States . 
Although his book The Rise and Fall of American Growth will not be published until January 2016 , his thesis has already garnered coverage in the Economist and Foreign Affairs . 
Clearly , Gordon &apos;s gloomy assessment of America &apos;s growth prospects deserves to be taken seriously . 
But is it right ? 
Gordon argues that the major technological changes that raised the standard of living in the past are much more important than anything that can happen in the future . 
He points to examples such as indoor plumbing , automobiles , electricity , telephones , and central heating , and argues that all of them were much more important for living standards than recent innovations like the internet and mobile phones . 
I agree with Gordon that I would rather give up my mobile phone and even the Internet than go without indoor plumbing and electricity . 
But that just means that we are lucky to be living now rather than a century ago ( and even luckier to be living now than two centuries ago or in the middle ages ) . 
The fact that these major innovations happened in the past is not a reason to be pessimistic about the future . 
Gordon also points to the recent slowdown in real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP growth . 
According to official US statistics , real GDP per worker grew at an average annual rate of 2.3 % from 1891 to 1972 , but by only 1.5 % since then . 
But the official statistics on GDP growth fail to capture most of the gains in our standard of living that come from new and improved goods and services . 
That means that the official growth rate does not reflect the rise in real incomes that came with air conditioning , anti-cancer drugs , new surgical procedures , and the many more mundane innovations . 
Moreover , because the US government does not count anything in GDP unless it is sold in the market , the vast expansion of television entertainment and the introduction of services like Google and Facebook have been completely excluded from the national account . 
This means that the true rise in real incomes was actually faster than the official statistics imply - possibly much faster . 
That is true of the data for the first half of the twentieth century , and it continues to be true today . 
It is not clear whether the measurement problem was bigger in the more distant past than it has been recently ; but it is irrelevant when we think about the future . 
Whether growth in per capita income that is officially estimated at 1.5 % is in reality more like 3 % , we are enjoying the higher level of real incomes inherited from the past . 
So will future generations . 
Indeed , there is simply no reason for the view , often expressed in surveys and appearing in Gordon &apos;s book , that the children of today &apos;s generation will not enjoy a standard of living as high as their parents . &quot; 
That may be true for some people , especially those with relatively high incomes , but it is definitely not true for most people . Think about a 30-year-old new parent at the middle of the income distribution . 
If real incomes grow at just 1.5 % a year , the median income 30 years from now will be nearly 60 % higher than the income of today &apos;s median-income individual . 
Even if the child earns 30 % less than the median at that time , her income would still be higher than today &apos;s median income . 
And if product innovations and improvements imply that per capita real incomes grow at 3 % a year , the median income of someone 30 years from now would be more than twice today &apos;s median income . 
So Americans are lucky that they have inherited the innovations of the past , and that real incomes will continue to grow in the future . 
But that is not a reason for complacency . 
The US can increase its future growth rate by improving its education system , raising its rates of saving and investment to where they were in the past , and fixing the features of its tax and transfer systems that reduce employment and earnings . 
Gordon focuses on the effect of technological innovation on Americans &quot; real incomes . 
But an important limitation of his argument is that it gives short shrift to policy innovation . 
America &apos;s economy - and those of many other countries - could grow faster in the future if policymakers adopt the appropriate reforms .
