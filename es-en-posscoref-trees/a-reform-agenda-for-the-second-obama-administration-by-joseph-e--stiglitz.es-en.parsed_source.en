America &apos;s Hope Against Hope 
NEW YORK - After a hard-fought election campaign , costing well in excess of $ 2 billion , it seems to many observers that not much has changed in American politics : Barack Obama is still President , the Republicans still control the House of Representatives , and the Democrats still have a majority in the Senate . 
With America facing a &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; - automatic tax increases and spending cuts at the start of 2013 that will most likely drive the economy into recession unless bipartisan agreement on an alternative fiscal path is reached - could there be anything worse than continued political gridlock ? 
In fact , the election had several salutary effects - beyond showing that unbridled corporate spending could not buy an election , and that demographic changes in the United States may doom Republican extremism . 
The Republicans &quot; explicit campaign of disenfranchisement in some states - like Pennsylvania , where they tried to make it more difficult for African-Americans and Latinos to register to vote - backfired : those whose rights were threatened were motivated to turn out and exercise them . 
In Massachusetts , Elizabeth Warren , a Harvard law professor and tireless warrior for reforms to protect ordinary citizens from banks &quot; abusive practices , won a seat in the Senate . 
Some of Mitt Romney &apos;s advisers seemed taken aback by Obama &apos;s victory : Wasn &apos;t the election supposed to be about economics ? 
They were confident that Americans would forget how the Republicans &quot; deregulatory zeal had brought the economy to the brink of ruin , and that voters had not noticed how their intransigence in Congress had prevented more effective policies from being pursued in the wake of the 2008 crisis . 
Voters , they assumed , would focus only on the current economic malaise . 
The Republicans should not have been caught off-guard by Americans &quot; interest in issues like disenfranchisement and gender equality . 
While these issues strike at the core of a country &apos;s values - of what we mean by democracy and limits on government intrusion into individuals &quot; lives - they are also economic issues . 
As I explain in my book The Price of Inequality , much of the rise in US economic inequality is attributable to a government in which the rich have disproportionate influence - and use that influence to entrench themselves . 
Obviously , issues like reproductive rights and gay marriage have large economic consequences as well . 
In terms of economic policy for the next four years , the main cause for post-election celebration is that the US has avoided measures that would have pushed it closer to recession , increased inequality , imposed further hardship on the elderly , and impeded access to health care for millions of Americans . 
Beyond that , here is what Americans should hope for : a strong &quot; jobs &quot; bill - based on investments in education , health care , technology , and infrastructure - that would stimulate the economy , restore growth , reduce unemployment , and generate tax revenues far in excess of its costs , thus improving the country &apos;s fiscal position . 
They might also hope for a housing program that finally addresses America &apos;s foreclosure crisis . 
A comprehensive program to increase economic opportunity and reduce inequality is also needed - its goal being to remove , within the next decade , America &apos;s distinction as the advanced country with the highest inequality and the least social mobility . 
This implies , among other things , a fair tax system that is more progressive and eliminates the distortions and loopholes that allow speculators to pay taxes at a lower effective rate than those who work for a living , and that enable the rich to use the Cayman Islands to avoid paying their fair share . 
America - and the world - would also benefit from a US energy policy that reduces reliance on imports not just by increasing domestic production , but also by cutting consumption , and that recognizes the risks posed by global warming . 
Moreover , America &apos;s science and technology policy must reflect an understanding that long-term increases in living standards depend upon productivity growth , which reflects technological progress that assumes a solid foundation of basic research . 
Finally , the US needs a financial system that serves all of society , rather than operating as if it were an end in itself . 
That means that the system &apos;s focus must shift from speculative and proprietary trading to lending and job creation , which implies reforms of financial-sector regulation , and of anti-trust and corporate-governance laws , together with adequate enforcement to ensure that markets do not become rigged casinos . 
Globalization has made all countries more interdependent , in turn requiring greater global cooperation . 
We might hopethat America will show more leadership in reforming the global financial system by advocating for stronger international regulation , a global reserve system , and better ways to restructure sovereign debt ; in addressing global warming ; in democratizing the international economic institutions ; and in providing assistance to poorer countries . 
Americans should hope for all of this , though I am not sanguine that they will get much of it . 
More likely , America will muddle through - here another little program for struggling students and homeowners , there the end of the Bush tax cuts for millionaires , but no wholesale tax reform , serious cutbacks in defense spending , or significant progress on global warming . 
With the euro crisis likely to continue unabated , America &apos;s continuing malaise does not bode well for global growth . 
Even worse , in the absence of strong American leadership , longstanding global problems - from climate change to urgently needed reforms of the international monetary system - will continue to fester . 
Nonetheless , we should be grateful : it is better to be standing still than it is to be heading in the wrong direction .
