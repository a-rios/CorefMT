Does Capitalism Cause Poverty ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Capitalism gets blamed for many things nowadays : poverty , inequality , unemployment , even global warming . 
As Pope Francis said in a recent speech in Bolivia : &quot; This system is by now intolerable : farm workers find it intolerable , laborers find it intolerable , communities find it intolerable , peoples find it intolerable . 
The earth itself - our sister , Mother Earth , as Saint Francis would say - also finds it intolerable . &quot; 
But are the problems that upset Francis the consequence of what he called &quot; unbridled capitalism &quot; ? 
Or are they instead caused by capitalism &apos;s surprising failure to do what was expected of it ? 
Should an agenda to advance social justice be based on bridling capitalism or on eliminating the barriers that thwart its expansion ? 
The answer in Latin America , Africa , the Middle East , and Asia is obviously the latter . 
To see this , it is useful to recall how Karl Marx imagined the future . 
For Marx , the historic role of capitalism was to reorganize production . 
Gone would be the family farms , artisan yards , and the &quot; nation of shopkeepers , &quot; as Napoleon is alleged to have scornfully referred to Britain . 
All these petty bourgeois activities would be plowed over by the equivalent of today &apos;s Zara , Toyota , Airbus , or Walmart . 
As a result , the means of production would no longer be owned by those doing the work , as on the family farm or in the craftsman &apos;s workshop , but by &quot; capital . &quot; 
Workers would possess only their own labor , which they would be forced to exchange for a miserable wage . 
Nonetheless , they would be more fortunate than the &quot; reserve army of the unemployed &quot; - a pool of idle labor large enough to make others fear losing their job , but small enough not to waste the surplus value that could be extracted by making them work . 
With all previous social classes transformed into the working class , and all means of production in the hands of an ever-dwindling group of owners of &quot; capital , &quot; a proletarian revolution would lead humanity to a world of perfect justice : &quot; From each according to his ability , to each according to his needs , &quot; as Marx famously put it . 
Clearly , the poet and philosopher Paul Valéry was right : &quot; The future , like everything else , is no longer what it used to be . &quot; 
But we should not make fun of Marx &apos;s well-known prediction error . 
After all , as the physicist Niels Bohr wryly noted , &quot; Prediction is difficult , especially about the future . &quot; 
We now know that as the ink was drying on the Communist Manifesto , wages in Europe and the United States were beginning a 160-year-long rise , making workers part of the middle class , with cars , mortgages , pensions , and petty bourgeois concerns . 
Politicians today promise to create jobs - or more opportunities to be exploited by capital - not to take over the means of production . 
Capitalism could achieve this transformation because the reorganization of production allowed for an unprecedented increase in productivity . 
The division of labor within and across firms , which Adam Smith had already envisioned in 1776 as the engine of growth , allowed for a division of knowhow among individuals that permitted the whole to know more than the parts and form ever-growing networks of exchange and collaboration . 
A modern corporation has experts in production , design , marketing , sales , finance , accounting , human resource management , logistics , taxes , contracts , and so on . 
Instead , it is a coordinated network of people that possess different types of Das Human-Kapital . 
In the developed world , capitalism did transform almost everyone into a wage laborer , but it also lifted them out of poverty and made them more prosperous than Marx could have imagined . 
That was not the only thing Marx got wrong . 
More surprisingly , the capitalist reorganization of production petered out in the developing world , leaving the vast majority of the labor force outside its control . 
The numbers are astounding . 
While only one in nine people in the United States are self-employed , the proportion in India is 19 out of 20 . 
Fewer than one-fifth of workers in Peru are employed by the kind of private businesses that Marx had in mind . 
In Mexico , about one in three are . 
Even within countries , measures of wellbeing are strongly related to the proportion of the labor force employed in capitalist production . 
In Mexico &apos;s state of Nuevo León , two-thirds of workers are employed by private incorporated businesses , while in Chiapas only one in seven is . 
No wonder , then , that per capita income is more than nine times higher in Nuevo León than in Chiapas . 
In Colombia , per capita income in Bogota is four times higher than in Maicao . 
Unsurprisingly , the share of capitalist employment is six times higher in Bogota . 
In poverty-stricken Bolivia , Francis criticized &quot; the mentality of profit at any price , with no concern for social exclusion or the destruction of nature , &quot; along with &quot; a crude and naive trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system . &quot; 
But this explanation of capitalism &apos;s failure is wide of the mark . 
The world &apos;s most profitable companies are not exploiting Bolivia . 
The developing world &apos;s fundamental problem is that capitalism has not reorganized production and employment in the poorest countries and regions , leaving the bulk of the labor force outside its scope of operation . 
As Rafael Di Tella and Robert MacCulloch have shown , the world &apos;s poorest countries are not characterized by naive trust in capitalism , but by utter distrust , which leads to heavy government intervention and regulation of business . 
Under such conditions , capitalism does not thrive and economies remain poor . 
Francis is right to focus attention on the plight of the world &apos;s poorest . 
Their misery , however , is not the consequence of unbridled capitalism , but of a capitalism that has been bridled in just the wrong way .
