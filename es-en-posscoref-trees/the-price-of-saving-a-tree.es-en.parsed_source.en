The Price of Saving a Tree 
Latin America is blessed with more than its fair share of wildlife and lush forests . 
A third of the world &apos;s mammal species and more than a quarter of all known reptiles and bird species can be found there . 
But this abundance is under threat . 
Felling seven million hectares of trees each year , South America clears more forests than any other continent . 
As a result , more than 10,000 species are threatened with extinction - two-thirds of all endangered species on the planet . 
In a sense , the solution to this challenge is as plain as day . 
Landowners cut down trees because it is the most economically beneficial thing for them to do . 
If we can unlock the hidden potential in Latin America &apos;s forests - without destroying them - then we could provide a solution to the problem of habitat destruction . 
We can easily tally the costs of individual conservation efforts like saving the northern spotted owl . 
Calculating how much it would cost to stop landowners felling their trees is harder . 
Economists &quot; estimates range from $ 1.23 billion a year ( to save trees in Latin America &apos;s biodiversity &quot; hot spots &quot; ) to $ 5.8 billion a year ( to save 2 % of the continent &apos;s land area ) to $ 500 billion ( making a one-off payment to save all of Latin America &apos;s forests ) . 
While the economic benefits we get from biodiversity might seem intangible , they are real and quantifiable . 
One common argument is that governments should protect biodiversity because of its untapped potential for the pharmaceutical industry . 
A fern deep in the forest could , for example , one day prove helpful in the fight against HIV / AIDS . 
This idea became very popular in the 1990 &quot; s . 
A famous project saw Merck Pharmaceutical provide $ 1 million to Costa Rica in exchange for 1,000 plants collected from its forest . 
Although the Merck project successfully raised money for Costa Rican biodiversity research , few if any drugs have been developed , and the model has not been transferred elsewhere . 
The merits of &quot; bio-prospecting &quot; have been examined carefully , and the returns are in fact very modest , ranging from just $ 0.20 per hectare in parts of California to $ 20 in Western Ecuador . 
Thus , the potential for pharmaceutical development will not provide strong encouragement to private landowners or companies to protect their land . 
Another approach for policymakers is to quantify the economic benefits of &quot; ecosystem services &quot; - the miraculous yet mundane things that nature provides like erosion control , water management , and purification . 
The benefits from ecosystem services in Latin America amount to $ 11 trillion , according to one prominent economist &apos;s methodology . 
But , while this implies that the benefits of conservation outstrip the costs by an extraordinary margin , the calculations have been widely criticized . 
The real hope lies in the idea of protecting forests for their value in the fight against climate change . 
Forests contain huge amounts of carbon . 
With the advent of concern about global warming and the role that carbon and carbon dioxide play , it is possible to estimate the value of a forest for sequestrating carbon . 
Simply put , by controlling deforestation we can significantly affect the carbon emissions that cause climate change . 
Recent market transactions on the European Climate Exchange place the value of carbon somewhere between $ 10 and $ 100 per ton . 
Even if we use what looks like a fairly conservative price of $ 20 , that means Latin America &apos;s trees are worth a whopping $ 2 trillion . 
If we count the 70 billion tons of carbon in the dead wood , litter , and soils on the forest floor , the additional value is $ 1.4 trillion . 
Sorting out the benefits is one thing . 
Next we need to work out how much we &apos;re willing to pay to keep these trees standing . 
For a landowner , the value of cleared land works out to $ 300 per hectare on average . 
So let &apos;s assume that governments will need to pay at least $ 500 per hectare to stop them from felling their trees . 
That adds up to $ 500 billion across all of Latin America . 
Thus , the benefits are between four and 6.8 times greater than the cost . 
But the cost will still seem prohibitive to many policy makers . 
They may , therefore , like to consider another option : discouraging tree-felling only in those areas that have high recent rates of deforestation . 
This takes into account the fact that many forest owners have no intention of cutting down trees , so won &apos;t require compensation . 
Using a more realistic approach , and including monitoring and administration costs , the outlay for governments will still be less than half of the economic benefits . 
A lot more research needs to be done to establish the true costs and benefits of protecting forest ecosystems and biodiversity . 
But growing concern about the peril of climate change could help save some of this continent &apos;s lush forests .
