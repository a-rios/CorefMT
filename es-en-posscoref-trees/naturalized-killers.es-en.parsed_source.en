Naturalized Killers 
The arrest of 17 people in Canada on terrorist charges underscores , across the West , a growing sense of dread and inevitability that is rooted in the homegrown nature of the threat . 
But what do we really know about these killers among us ? 
We know , of course , the broad outline of their all-encompassing fundamentalism , and we have some vague ideas about Al Qaeda as a decentralized network of cells in many countries that seeks to acquire chemical , biological , and perhaps even nuclear weapons . 
We also know their leaders &quot; long-term goals : seize power in Muslim countries and attack the Western states that support secular regimes in the Islamic world . 
Finally , we also know that the leaders of this fanatical tide are few , but now have the sympathy of millions of ordinary Muslims . 
There have always been fanatical individuals ready to die and kill in the name of their beliefs . 
After all , as the London and Madrid bombings demonstrated , a cell phone is all that is needed to time an explosion - or a series of explosions - with deadly efficiency . 
Our freedoms and social fluidity also contribute to the threat . 
People move about the globe cheaply and with relative ease . 
Immigrants can establish themselves in new societies , and in democratic states they can live completely free of supervision . 
Our freedoms are their tools . 
So how do we fight such an amorphous enemy ? 
President George W. Bush has demonstrated one way not to do it : his invasion and occupation of Iraq show that directly attacking Muslim states only fuels fanaticism . 
Of course , civilized countries should not give up the fight against extremist Islam because of the bloodshed in Iraq ; but we must recognize that war , occupation , and forced submission to military power have merely caused mass humiliation and resentment among many ordinary Muslims - emotions that are then channeled into terrorist networks . 
Prime Minister Tony Blair can loudly proclaim that the London bombings of July last year are unrelated to Britain &apos;s participation in the Iraq war , but the terrorists themselves , once arrested , said exactly the opposite . 
Indeed , here is how one of the Madrid bombers described the psychological preparation to which he had been submitted : his leader &quot; made us watch DVDs showing pictures of war in Iraq , mostly pictures of women and children killed by American and British soldiers . &quot; 
There is also no shortage of images of abused prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison or the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , which have likewise done more to recruit new adherents to Islamic fanaticism than any sermon in a radical mosque . 
Simply put , bombs dropped from several thousands meters do not kill less indiscriminately than explosive charges placed in train cars . 
Acknowledging this is not to excuse terrorism , but it is a first step toward understanding terrorism &apos;s underlying causes , and thus toward their elimination . 
Above all , it is to acknowledge that democratic societies must use both political and police tactics in confronting fanatical terrorists . 
Politics is necessary for the simple reason that occupying armies and police cannot force hundreds of millions of Muslims to shed their hostility . 
Political action implies actually leaving Iraq quickly and finding a fair solution to the Palestinian conflict , which in turn requires ending the occupation of all Palestinian territories . 
Of course , extinguishing these hot spots will not erode the fanaticism of diehard and suicidal activists ; nor will it rid us of the avidity and hatred that is so evident among the leaders of Islamic rage . 
Policing is the second part of any effective strategy . 
Greater efforts at infiltrating terror networks are needed , as is a deeper knowledge of the social structures created by the terrorists , in order to block their financial support . 
This may mean eliminating shadowy &quot; tax havens , &quot; tapping phone lines , and identifying individuals considered highly dangerous . 
Police actions must be merciless , even if this means more controls and surveillance . 
It is precisely to prevent the development of a collective security fear that we need to alter the equilibrium between security and freedom . 
While the European Union lags behind the US in terms of conventional weapons , its capacity to fight terrorism is probably higher . 
For historical reasons , Europe benefits from a political maturity that has allowed it to avoid Bush &apos;s Manichean worldview , which has merely reinforced , rather than undermined , the enemy &apos;s fanaticism . 
Moreover , for geographical reasons , Europe also benefits from a better knowledge of Arab and Muslim countries and extensive familiarity with their populations . 
The West can and must prevail in this fight and in the defense of the values that it cherishes . 
It might even find , along the way , a new and urgently needed motivation to reinforce its fraying unity .
