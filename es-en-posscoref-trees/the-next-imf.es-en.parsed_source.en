The Next IMF 
The international monetary and financial system has witnessed tremendous change over the recent decades . 
Rapid expansion in cross-border capital flows , continued financial innovation , and deepening financial markets pose increasing challenges not only for national policy makers , but also for international financial institutions . 
This has been particularly true of the IMF as it seeks to serve its global membership , and it has triggered a critically important discussion of the Fund &apos;s strategic direction . 
The IMF &apos;s current strategic review does not start from scratch . 
The reform process was launched at the end of the 1990 &quot; s and was continued by former Managing Director Horst KÃ¶hler with important initiatives . 
For example , the introduction of standards and codes , reports on their observation ( ROSC &apos;s ) , Financial Sector Assessment Programs ( FSAP &apos;s ) , and the resulting increase in the Fund &apos;s transparency might contribute to an improvement of bilateral , regional , and multilateral surveillance . 
The exceptional access policy , which seeks to both enhance the predictability of the Fund &apos;s lending policy and to safeguard its financial position , is still waiting for its first real test . 
But the world needs to look beyond even these issues . 
The IMF &apos;s management shares many strategic considerations repeatedly raised by the Bundesbank , which has argued that the Fund should limit its activities to its core mandate : promoting monetary and financial stability . 
Thus , the IMF &apos;s role in the international monetary system should not go beyond applying its key instruments for promoting macroeconomic stability : surveillance and economic policy advice . 
In fact , these two instruments should go hand in hand as the IMF &apos;s internal reforms continue . 
Increasing analytical focus and improving transparency by providing comprehensive advice and timely information would serve to strengthen surveillance further . 
By contrast , an IMF that attempted to act , say , as an international umpire of national exchange-rate policies would face insurmountable implementation and acceptance problems . 
Similarly , positioning the IMF as a general risk insurer by introducing precautionary credit lines above normal access limits would be compatible neither with its mission to provide financial assistance on deliberately non-risk-adjusted terms nor with the current system of refinancing short-term Fund credit through risk-free official reserves . 
Only in true balance-of-payments crises should the IMF stand ready to provide limited temporary financial assistance to member countries , thereby encouraging their own policy adjustments and signaling this commitment to the markets . 
Nor is becoming a development institution consistent with the Fund &apos;s mission . 
Development financing should be left to the World Bank . 
By concentrating on their specific comparative advantages in line with clearly defined mandates , both institutions will fulfill their tasks more efficiently . 
Indeed , the implementation of the Multilateral Debt Relief initiated by the G-8 already provides an unprecedented opportunity to complete the process of debt relief for a large number of low-income countries . 
This also opens the way for the IMF to dispose of its current diffusion of activity in low-income countries and intensify its agenda in the areas of its core expertise . 
Finally , adequate representation and the right of each member to have a say in the Fund is a prerequisite of the legitimacy that the IMF needs to fulfill its global role . 
The quota distribution should be guided by members &quot; economic weight and degree of integration into the global economy , and any quota adjustments must be undertaken in a coherent manner that applies the same standard for all countries . 
But , in order to maintain the creditor countries &quot; willingness to contribute to the Fund &apos;s finances , a strong link must be maintained between quotas , on the one hand , and voting rights , access to IMF resources , and financial contributions on the other hand . 
The issue of representation is an important component of the IMF &apos;s strategic review . 
However , that review , and the reforms that follow from it , must be much more comprehensive in order to benefit the Fund and all of its members .
