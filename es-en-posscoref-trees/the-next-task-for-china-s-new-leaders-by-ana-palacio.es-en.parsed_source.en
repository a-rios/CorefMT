The Next Task for China &apos;s New Leaders 
BEIJING - On a recent fact-finding trip to China , organized by the European Council on Foreign Relations , I began with the assumption that the country &apos;s biggest challenge revolved around the need to promote domestic consumption in order to maintain rapid economic growth . 
By the end of the trip , what had emerged was a complex picture of Chinese assertiveness and uncertainty , poise and anxiety . 
Although impending , the 18th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) is shrouded in mystery . 
While the congress is presumably set for October , the exact dates remain unknown , as does much about the internal process and preparatory discussions . 
For much of this year , there seemed to be one certainty in the coming leadership transition : the CCP &apos;s new general secretary would be Xi Jinping , a man whose political vision could be elaborated in well under 30 seconds . 
But Xi &apos;s mysterious vanishing act , in which he dropped from public view for almost two weeks in September - after abruptly canceling meetings with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the prime minister of Singapore ( rare occurrences for the protocol-fixated Chinese leadership ) - has stirred more speculation . 
It has also fueled concerns about whether so secretive a leadership can effectively govern the world &apos;s second-largest economy . 
Despite its outward appearance of monolithic resolve , China is in a state of flux , flaunting its confidence while bulging with internal sources of insecurity . 
Its undeniable economic success - albeit closely tied to that of the global economy - stands in stark contrast to the heightened sense of crisis and insecurity that hovers in the background . 
Two distinct quandaries confront China &apos;s leaders : the first centers on the growing demands and dissatisfactions of Chinese society - from peasants and students to white-collar workers and pensioners ; the second consists in the country &apos;s conduct of foreign policy . 
Will the next CCP administration address these critical issues ? 
Internally , as China has moved from mass poverty to widening prosperity , economic growth - though a vital source of the CCP &apos;s legitimacy - is no longer enough . 
Restlessness is pervasive : while statistics vary , depending on how government agencies define the term , it is estimated that there were roughly 180,000 &quot; mass incidents &quot; in China in 2011 alone . 
China &apos;s rising urban middle class and its surprisingly well-organized rural communities are increasingly demanding less corrupt and more accountable government , cleaner air and water , safer food and drug supplies , and an independent , well-functioning judicial system . 
Popular dissatisfaction partly reflects a phenomenon that invariably arose in numerous conversations with academics , intellectuals , and top officials : the murky frontier of legality currently reigning in China . 
The blurriness of the law creates a no-man &apos;s land of ambiguity in which the authorities thrive : legal predictability is aspirational , while daily life for ordinary people requires navigating the shallow , shifting waters of what the powerful will tolerate . 
At the same time , the rule of law plays a prominent role in Chinese political discourse . 
But , while nominally acknowledging its importance , officials creatively turn the concept on its head . 
And yet , formal pronouncements aside , if China &apos;s leadership is to meet growing popular demands and quell rising discontent , it will have to commit itself to the rule of law in fact . 
China &apos;s recent emergence as a key international player ( albeit a reluctant one ) has exposed its leaders &quot; uncertainty about the country &apos;s future global role , as well as raising questions about their readiness to bear the responsibilities that its stature implies . 
China still falters when it comes to building &quot; soft power &quot; or assuring interlocutors , near and far , that its &quot; peaceful rise &quot; will remain peaceful . 
Indeed , China today is increasingly perceived to be undermining the international order , while promoting novel interpretations of concepts such as democracy , pluralism , and representation . 
For many , its behavior toward Syria - aligning itself with Russia to block international action - and in maritime territorial disputes with its neighbors exemplifies this tendency . 
It is , therefore , little surprise that China &apos;s policies are widely regarded as a reflection of former Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping &apos;s call for a strategy of &quot; hiding our light and nurturing our strength . &quot; 
But China &apos;s ability to persuade others that its international behavior stems from its search for balance will depend on its leaders &quot; ability to embrace the rule of law - in substance rather than just in rhetoric - as a fundamental basis for the harmony that they publicly espouse . 
So far , the survival of China &apos;s political system has rested on the identification and deft handling of the most pressing issues of the day . 
Every Chinese leader since Mao Zedong &apos;s death in 1976 has left an indelible mark . 
And the outgoing Hu Jintao &apos;s objective was development , particularly in the country &apos;s vast interior , unleashed through large-scale privatization .
