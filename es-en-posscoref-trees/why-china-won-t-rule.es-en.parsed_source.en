Why China Won &apos;t Rule 
LONDON - Is China poised to become the world &apos;s next superpower ? 
This question is increasingly asked as China &apos;s economic growth surges ahead at more than 8 % a year , while the developed world remains mired in recession or near-recession . 
China is already the world &apos;s second largest economy , and will be the largest in 2017 . 
And its military spending is racing ahead of its GDP growth . 
The question is reasonable enough if we don &apos;t give it an American twist . 
To the American mind , there can be only one superpower , so China &apos;s rise will automatically be at the expense of the United States . 
Indeed , for many in the US , China represents an existential challenge . 
This is way over the top . 
In fact , the existence of a single superpower is highly abnormal , and was brought about only by the unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . 
The normal situation is one of coexistence , sometimes peaceful sometimes warlike , between several great powers . 
For example , Great Britain , whose place the US is often said to have taken , was never a &quot; superpower &quot; in the American sense . 
Despite its far-flung empire and naval supremacy , nineteenth-century Britain could never have won a war against France , Germany , or Russia without allies . 
Britain was , rather , a world power - one of many historical empires distinguished from lesser powers by the geographic scope of their influence and interests . 
The sensible question , then , is not whether China will replace the US , but whether it will start to acquire some of the attributes of a world power , particularly a sense of responsibility for global order . 
Even posed in this more modest way , the question does not admit of a clear answer . 
The first problem is China &apos;s economy , so dynamic on the surface , but so rickety underneath . 
The analyst Chi Lo lucidly presents a picture of macro success alongside micro failure . 
The huge stimulus of RMB4 trillion ( $ 586 billion ) in November 2008 , mostly poured into loss-making state-owned enterprises via directed bank lending , sustained China &apos;s growth in the face of global recession . 
But the price was an increasingly serious misallocation of capital , resulting in growing portfolios of bad loans , while excessive Chinese household savings have inflated real-estate bubbles . 
Moreover , Chi argues that the crisis of 2008 shattered China &apos;s export-led growth model , owing to prolonged impairment of demand in the advanced countries . 
China now urgently needs to rebalance its economy by shifting from public investment and exports towards public and private consumption . 
In the short run , some of its savings need to be invested in real assets abroad , and not just parked in US Treasuries . 
But , in the longer term , Chinese households &quot; excessive propensity to save must be reduced by developing a social safety net and consumer credit instruments . 
Moreover , to be a world economic power , China requires a currency in which foreigners want to invest . 
That means introducing full convertibility and creating a deep and liquid financial system , a stock market for raising capital , and a market rate of interest for loans . 
And , while China has talked of &quot; internationalizing &quot; the renminbi , it has done little so far . 
&quot; Meanwhile , &quot; writes Chi , &quot; the dollar is still supported by the strong US political relations with most of the world &apos;s largest foreign-reserve-holding countries . &quot; 
Japan , South Korea , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar , and the United Arab Emirates all shelter under the US military umbrella . 
The second problem is one of political values . 
China &apos;s further &quot; ascent &quot; will depend on dismantling such classic communist policy icons as public-asset ownership , population control , and financial repression . 
The question remains how far these reforms will be allowed to go before they challenge the Communist Party &apos;s political monopoly , guaranteed by the 1978 constitution . 
Two important cultural values underpin China &apos;s political system . 
The first is the hierarchical and familial character of Chinese political thought . 
Chinese philosophers acknowledge the value of spontaneity , but within a strictly ordered world in which people know their place . 
As the Analects of Confucius puts it : &quot; Let the ruler be a ruler , the subject a subject , a father a father , and a son a son . &quot; 
There is also very little belief in the sanctity of human life : Buddhism holds that there is no difference between humans and animals and plants . 
A pledge to protect human rights was written into the Chinese constitution in 2004 ; but , as the recent case of the blind dissident Chen Guangcheng illustrates , this is mostly a dead letter . 
Similarly , private property ranks below collective property . 
Then there is the Confucian doctrine of the &quot; mandate of heaven , &quot; by which political rule is legitimized . 
Today , the mandate of Marxism has taken its place , but neither has any room for a mandate of the people . 
Ambivalence about the source of legitimate government is not only a major obstacle to democratization , but is also a potential source of political instability . 
These historical legacies limit the extent to which China will be able to share in global leadership , which requires some degree of compatibility between Chinese and Western values . 
The West claims that its values are universal , and the US and Europe will not cease pressing those values on China . 
It is hard to see this process going into reverse , with China starting to export its own values . 
China has a choice : it can either accept Western values , or it can try to carve out an East Asian sphere to insulate itself from them . 
The latter course would provoke conflict not only with the US , but also with other Asian powers , particularly Japan and India . 
China &apos;s best possible future thus probably lies in accepting Western norms while trying to flavor them with &quot; Chinese characteristics . &quot; 
But neither choice is a scenario for China &quot; replacing &quot; the US . 
Nor , I think , is this what China wants . 
Its goal is respect , not dominance .
