Answering Iran 
NEW YORK - We know quite a bit about Iran &apos;s nuclear program , and what we know is not encouraging . 
Iran is reported to be enriching uranium at two sites - some of it to levels of 20 % , far beyond what is required for civilian purposes . 
The International Atomic Energy Agency also reports that Iran is carrying out research to develop designs for nuclear warheads . 
In short , Iranian officials &quot; claims that their nuclear program is aimed solely at power generation or medical research lacks all plausibility . 
Yet there is still much that the world does not know . 
For example , we do not know whether Iran is conducting secret activities at undisclosed sites , or when Iran could develop a crude nuclear weapon , with estimates ranging from several months to several years . 
We also do not know whether Iran &apos;s divided leadership has decided to develop nuclear weapons , or to stop just short , calculating that the country could derive many of the benefits of possessing nuclear weapons without running the risks or incurring the costs of actually doing so . 
Either way , Iran &apos;s activities confront the world with difficult choices . 
None is costless or risk-free . 
Moreover , neither the costs nor the risks are possible to calculate with precision . 
One option would be to accept and live with a nuclear or near-nuclear Iran . 
This assumes that Iran could be deterred from using its weapons , much as the Soviet Union was during the Cold War . 
Missile defenses could be expanded ; the United States could extend security guarantees so that Iran would understand that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be met with a decisive American response . 
But there are significant drawbacks to acquiescing to a nuclear-armed Iran . 
Given its use of subversion and terrorism against its adversaries , a nuclear-armed Iran might be even more assertive . 
It might also transfer nuclear-related material , technology , or weapons to allies ( Hugo Ch√°vez &apos;s Venezuela , for example ) or radical organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas . 
And , rather than promoting caution and stability in the region , Iran or Israel could be tempted to strike first in a crisis . 
Nor can it be assumed that Iran &apos;s divided and radical leadership would always act rationally , or that proliferation would stop with the Islamic Republic . 
If Iran develops its nuclear weapons , countries such as Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and Egypt would be tempted to purchase or develop nuclear weapons of their own . 
A Middle East with multiple fingers on multiple triggers is as good a definition of a nightmare as there is . 
At the opposite end of the spectrum of policy choices is a preventive attack : a military strike ( most likely by Israel , the US , or both ) against sites in Iran associated with its nuclear program . 
The core objective would be to interrupt the emergence of a threat that is still gathering . 
Here , again , there are considerable drawbacks . 
Even a successful preventive attack would at most set back Iran &apos;s nuclear program a few years . 
It would almost certainly be rebuilt , presumably in underground , fortified sites that would make future attacks far more difficult to carry out . 
Moreover , Iran could well retaliate immediately against targets that could include Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Afghanistan , and other US interests worldwide - as well as sites on American territory . 
Hezbollah could attack Israel . 
If all of this happened , the price of oil would skyrocket owing to shortages and fears , possibly driving much of the world economy , already in a precarious position , into recession . 
An armed attack could also cause the Iranian public to rally around the government , reducing the chances that a more responsible leadership might emerge . 
It thus comes as little surprise that the US and much of the world have explored alternatives , including regime change in Iran . 
But , however desirable that might be , no policy can assuredly bring it about . 
As a result , the principal policy toward Iran centers on the imposition of increasingly painful economic sanctions . 
The rationale underlying this policy is that Iran &apos;s leaders , fearful of losing political control as popular discontent increases over the sanctions &quot; effects , will recalculate the costs and benefits of their nuclear activities and become receptive to negotiated constraints in exchange for removal of sanctions . 
That could happen . 
International support for sanctions is considerable and increasing . 
It is becoming more difficult for Iran ( whose economy depends to a large extent on oil exports of more than two million barrels a day ) to find customers - and especially customers willing to pay full price . 
Meanwhile , Iran &apos;s currency is weakening , pricing imported goods out of many Iranians &quot; reach . 
Additional elements of current policy that seem to be having an effect are clandestine efforts aimed at impeding Iran &apos;s ability to import sensitive technologies . 
Viruses have infiltrated computers in Iran , reducing the efficiency of the centrifuges central to enriching uranium . 
It is also possible that the assassination of selected individuals has slowed the advance of Iranian nuclear efforts . 
But slowing Iran &apos;s efforts is not the same as stopping them . 
So one question is whether existing sanctions can be extended and tightened ; here , China and Russia must determine their priorities . 
Another question is whether any sanctions will be enough to persuade Iran &apos;s leaders to accept verifiable limits on their nuclear program . 
And a third unsettled issue is how long Israel or the US will tolerate Iranian efforts before striking militarily . 
Indeed , the only certainty may be that Iran &apos;s nuclear program will be a major international issue in 2012 - quite possibly the most important one .
