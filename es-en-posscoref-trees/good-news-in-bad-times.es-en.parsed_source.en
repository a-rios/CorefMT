Good News in Bad Times 
NEW YORK - At a time when the headlines are filled with financial crises and violence , it is especially important to recognize the creativity of many governments in fighting poverty , disease , and hunger . 
The point is not merely to make ourselves feel a little better , but rather to confront one of the world &apos;s gravest threats : the widespread pessimism that today &apos;s problems are too big to be solved . 
Studying the successes gives us the knowledge and confidence to step up our shared efforts to solve today &apos;s great global challenges . 
Hats off , first , to Mexico for pioneering the idea of &quot; conditional cash transfers &quot; to poor households . 
These transfers enable and encourage those households to invest in their children &apos;s health , nutrition , and schooling . 
Mexico &apos;s &quot; Opportunities Program , &quot; led by President Felipe Calderón is now being widely emulated around Latin America . 
Recently , at the behest of the singers Shakira and Alejandro Sanz , and a social movement that they lead , all of Latin America &apos;s leaders committed to step up the region &apos;s programs for early childhood development , based on the successes that have been proven to date . 
Norway , under the leadership of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg , is maintaining its tradition of creative social and environmental leadership . 
The government has put together a global alliance to prevent maternal death in childbirth , investing in both safe delivery and survival of newborns . 
At the same time , Norway launched an innovative $ 1 billion program with Brazil to induce poor communities in the Amazon to end rampant deforestation . 
Cleverly , Norway pays out the funds to Brazil only upon proven success in avoiding deforestation ( compared with an agreed baseline ) . 
Spain , under the leadership of Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , has given a major stimulus to helping the poorest countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) . 
Spain created a new MDG Fund at the United Nations to promote the cooperation needed within the UN to address the various challenges of the MDGs . 
The Spanish Government rightly proposed that true solutions to poverty require simultaneous investments in health , education , agriculture , and infrastructure , and then the Spanish put up the funds to help make that integrated vision a practical reality . 
Spain will host a meeting in January 2009 to launch a new fight against global hunger . 
Once again , Spain is proposing practical and innovative means to move from talk to action , specifically to help impoverished peasant farmers to get the tools , seeds , and fertilizer that they need to increase their farm productivity , incomes , and food security . 
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has similarly surged to the forefront of global problem solving , putting forward a bold action plan on climate change and proposing new and practical means to address the MDGs . 
Australia put real money on the table for increased food production , along the lines that Spain is proposing . 
It also champions an increased program of action for the poor and environmentally threatened island economies of the Pacific region . 
These efforts have been matched by actions in the poorest countries . 
The landlocked and impoverished country of Malawi , under the leadership of President Bingu wa Mutharika , has doubled its annual food production since 2005 through a pioneering effort to help its poorest farmers . 
The program has been so successful that it is being emulated across Africa . 
Mali &apos;s government , under President Amadou Toumani Touré , has recently put forward a bold challenge to the world community . 
Mali is eager to scale up investments in agriculture , health , education , and infrastructure in its 166 poorest communities . 
The plans are detailed , thoughtful , credible , and based on proven successes that the government has already achieved . 
The rich world has promised to help Mali , and now Mali has led the way with its creativity . 
There are countless more cases that can be mentioned . 
The European Union has launched a € 1 billion effort to help peasant farmers . 
The Gates Foundation , UNICEF , Rotary International , and many governments have succeeded in bringing down polio deaths to one-thousandth of the rate a generation ago , bringing the disease to the verge of eradication . 
Similar efforts are underway on many other fronts - the control of worm infections and leprosy , and now a major global effort to bring malaria deaths nearly to zero by 2015 . 
All of these successes , and many more , share a similar pattern . 
They address a well-defined and serious challenge , for example low food production or a specific disease , and are based on a well-defined set of solutions , such as agricultural equipment and inputs needed by peasant farmers , or immunizations . 
Small-scale demonstration projects prove how success can be achieved ; the challenge then becomes taking the solutions &quot; to scale &quot; in nationwide or even worldwide programs . 
Leadership is needed , within the countries in need as well as among the rich nations that can help to launch and finance the solutions . 
Finally , modest amounts of money , directed at practical problem solving , can make an historic difference . 
Bad news can crowd out good news , especially in times of serious financial crisis and political unrest . 
Yet the good news shows that we will lose the battle against poverty and misery only if we give up , and fail to heed the intelligence and goodwill that can be mobilized today . 
And perhaps next year , the United States will rejoin the global effort with a new and remarkable force , led by a young president who has rightly told Americans and the world that &quot; Yes , we can . &quot;
