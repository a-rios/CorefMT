Stagnation by Design 
NEW YORK - Soon after the global financial crisis erupted in 2008 , I warned that unless the right policies were adopted , Japanese-style malaise - slow growth and near-stagnant incomes for years to come - could set in . 
While leaders on both sides of the Atlantic claimed that they had learned the lessons of Japan , they promptly proceeded to repeat some of the same mistakes . 
Now , even a key former United States official , the economist Larry Summers , is warning of secular stagnation . 
The basic point that I raised a half-decade ago was that , in a fundamental sense , the US economy was sick even before the crisis : it was only an asset-price bubble , created through lax regulation and low interest rates , that had made the economy seem robust . 
Beneath the surface , numerous problems were festering : growing inequality ; an unmet need for structural reform ( moving from a manufacturing-based economy to services and adapting to changing global comparative advantages ) ; persistent global imbalances ; and a financial system more attuned to speculating than to making investments that would create jobs , increase productivity , and redeploy surpluses to maximize social returns . 
Policymakers &quot; response to the crisis failed to address these issues ; worse , it exacerbated some of them and created new ones - and not just in the US . 
Moreover , underinvestment in both the public and private sector has created a generation of young people who have spent years idle and increasingly alienated at a point in their lives when they should have been honing their skills and increasing their productivity . 
On both sides of the Atlantic , GDP is likely to grow considerably faster this year than in 2013 . 
But , before leaders who embraced austerity policies open the champagne and toast themselves , they should examine where we are and consider the near-irreparable damage that these policies have caused . 
Every downturn eventually comes to an end . 
The mark of a good policy is that it succeeds in making the downturn shallower and shorter than it otherwise would have been . 
The mark of the austerity policies that many governments embraced is that they made the downturn far deeper and longer than was necessary , with long-lasting consequences . 
Real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP per capita is lower in most of the North Atlantic than it was in 2007 ; in Greece , the economy has shrunk by an estimated 23 % . 
Germany , the top-performing European country , has recorded miserly 0.7 % average annual growth over the last six years . 
The US economy is still roughly 15 % smaller than it would have been had growth continued even on the moderate pre-crisis trajectory . 
But even these numbers do not tell the full story of how bad things are , because GDP is not a good measure of success . 
Far more relevant is what is happening to household incomes . 
Median real income in the US is below its level in 1989 , a quarter-century ago ; median income for full-time male workers is lower now than it was more than 40 years ago . 
Some , like the economist Robert Gordon , have suggested that we should adjust to a new reality in which long-term productivity growth will be significantly below what it has been over the past century . 
Given economists &quot; miserable record - reflected in the run-up to the crisis - for even three-year predictions , no one should have much confidence in a crystal ball that forecasts decades into the future . 
But this much seems clear : unless government policies change , we are in for a long period of disappointment . 
Markets are not self-correcting . 
The underlying fundamental problems that I outlined earlier could get worse - and many are . 
Inequality leads to weak demand ; widening inequality weakens demand even more ; and , in most countries , including the US , the crisis has only worsened inequality . 
The trade surpluses of northern Europe have increased , even as China &apos;s have moderated . 
Most important , markets have never been very good at achieving structural transformations quickly on their own ; the transition from agriculture to manufacturing , for example , was anything but smooth ; on the contrary , it was accompanied by significant social dislocation and the Great Depression . 
This time is no different , but in some ways it could be worse : the sectors that should be growing , reflecting the needs and desires of citizens , are services like education and health , which traditionally have been publicly financed , and for good reason . 
But , rather than government facilitating the transition , austerity is inhibiting it . 
Malaise is better than a recession , and a recession is better than a depression . 
But the difficulties that we are facing now are not the result of the inexorable laws of economics , to which we simply must adjust , as we would to a natural disaster , like an earthquake or tsunami . 
They are not even a kind of penance that we have to pay for past sins - though , to be sure , the neoliberal policies that have prevailed for the past three decades have much to do with our current predicament . 
Instead , our current difficulties are the result of flawed policies . 
There are alternatives . 
But we will not find them in the self-satisfied complacency of the elites , whose incomes and stock portfolios are once again soaring . 
Only some people , it seems , must adjust to a permanently lower standard of living . 
Unfortunately , those people happen to be most people .
