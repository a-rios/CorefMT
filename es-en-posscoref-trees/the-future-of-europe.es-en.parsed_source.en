The Future of Europe 
CAMBRIDGE - In the first half of the last century , Europe tore itself apart in two wars and destroyed its central role in world politics . 
In the second half of the century , farsighted leaders looked beyond revenge and gradually constructed the institutions of European integration . 
The thought of France and Germany fighting each other again seems impossible , and the development of the European Union has greatly enhanced Europe &apos;s attractiveness and soft power in the world . 
Unfortunately , that historic achievement is now being called into question . 
In May 2010 , financial markets lost confidence in the ability of Greece to manage its budget deficit and to repay its debt . 
Fears of default began to affect other countries , such as Portugal and Spain , among the 16 members of the eurozone . 
In response , European governments , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund arranged a â‚¬ 700 billion emergency eurozone rescue program to calm the financial storms . 
While that intervention provided a temporary respite , uncertainty persists in financial markets . 
Last month , German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that , if the euro fails , &quot; then not only the currency fails .... Europe will fail , and with it the idea of European unity . &quot; 
European unity already faces significant constraints . 
Fiscal integration is limited . 
National identities remain stronger than a common European identity , despite six decades of integration , and national interests , while subdued in comparison to the past , still matter . 
The enlargement of the EU to include 27 states ( with more to come ) means that European institutions are likely to remain sui generis , and unlikely to produce a strong federal Europe or a single state . 
Legal integration is increasing , and European Court verdicts have compelled member countries to change policies . 
Over the decades , Europe has alternated between excessive optimism and bouts of &quot; Euro-pessimism &quot; such as the current period . 
As the journalist Marcus Walker recently put it , Europe &quot; was supposed to come of age as an actor on the world stage , bolstered by the Lisbon Treaty . 
Instead , Europe is starting to look like the loser in a new geopolitical order dominated by the US and emerging powers led by China . &quot; 
A &quot; seminal image , &quot; according to Walker , was the meeting on December 18 , 2009 , that brokered the modest Copenhagen Accord - a meeting led by the US and the Chinese , who invited the leaders of India , Brazil , and South Africa , but no Europeans . 
And now the recent financial crisis has exposed the limits of fiscal integration in the eurozone and raised questions about the role and future of the euro . 
What is the future of Europe ? 
As The Economist has noted , &quot; talk of Europe &apos;s relative decline seems to be everywhere just now .... You may hear glum figures about Europe &apos;s future weight and with some reason . 
In 1900 , Europe accounted for a quarter of the world &apos;s population . 
By 2060 , it may account for just 6 % - and almost a third of these will be more than 65 years old . &quot; 
Europe does face severe demographic problems , but size of population is not highly correlated with power , and predictions of Europe &apos;s downfall have a long history of failing to materialize . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , analysts spoke of Euro-sclerosis and a crippling malaise , but in the ensuing decades Europe showed impressive growth and institutional development . 
The EU &apos;s approach to sharing power , hammering out agreements , and resolving conflict by multiple committees can be frustrating and lacks drama , but it is increasingly relevant for many issues in a networked and interdependent world . 
As Mark Leonard , Director of the European Council on Foreign Relations , has put it , &quot; The conventional wisdom is that Europe &apos;s hour has come and gone . 
Its lack of vision , divisions , obsession with legal frameworks , unwillingness to project military power , and sclerotic economy are contrasted with a United States more dominant even than Rome ... But the problem is not Europe - it is our outdated understanding of power . &quot; 
The American political scientist Andrew Moravcsik makes the similar argument that European nations , singly and collectively , are the only states other than the US that are able to &quot; exert global influence across the full spectrum from &quot; hard &quot; to &quot; soft &quot; power . 
Insofar as the term retains any meaning , the world is bipolar , and is likely to remain so over the foreseeable future . &quot; 
Moravcsik argues that the pessimistic prognosis is based on a nineteenth-century realist view in which &quot; power is linked to the relative share of aggregate global resources and countries are engaged in constant zero-sum rivalry . &quot; 
Moreover , as he points out , Europe is the world &apos;s second military power , with 21 % of the world &apos;s military spending , compared to 5 % for China , 3 % for Russia , 2 % for India , and 1.5 % for Brazil . 
Tens of thousands of troops from the EU &apos;s member states have been deployed outside of their home countries in Sierra Leone , Congo , Ivory Coast , Chad , Lebanon , and Afghanistan . 
In terms of economic power , Europe has the world &apos;s largest market , and represents 17 % of world trade , compared to 12 % for the US . 
But all this potential strength may be to no avail if Europeans do not solve the immediate problems stemming from financial markets &quot; loss of confidence in the euro . 
All who admire the European experiment must hope that they succeed .
