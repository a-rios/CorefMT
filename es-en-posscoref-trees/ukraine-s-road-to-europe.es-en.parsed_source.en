Ukraine \ u0027s Road to Europe 
&quot; East is East , and West is West , and never the twain shall meet , &quot; Rudyard Kipling famously said . 
Ukraine may undoubtedly be of the East , but it is the East of Europe . 
So when Ukraine regained its independence ten years ago , integration with Europe became the goal for many of us . 
That road to Europe , however , wasn &apos;t paved with good intentions ; it often wasn &apos;t paved at all . 
Yet , as the results of the parliamentary elections held on March 31 demonstrate , Ukrainians remain determined to travel that road . 
I am a social democrat who was never a Communist party member , though I achieved success as a lawyer in Soviet times . 
I recognize that our Soviet &quot; heritage &quot; accounts for much of the hardship Ukraine faced in seeking its European vocation . 
After the USSR collapsed , Ukraine possessed an inefficient and militarised industrial base and a blundering bureaucracy . 
Its vast agricultural holdings were hamstrung by worn-out equipment and the inertia of Soviet state farming . 
Rural people became mired in squalor . 
Nowadays , low salaries make many lives here miserable , pensions are a joke , and the shadow economy is vast . 
But our Soviet heritage does not excuse everything . 
We muddled reform on our own . 
Despite this nostalgic policymaking , enactment by the Supreme Rada ( Ukraine &apos;s Parliament ) of civil , criminal , land , family and economic legal codes over the years was something of a near revolution . 
Indeed , although painful , acceptance of Western values by a society excluded for centuries from European history has gained momentum despite the fact that we often see ourselves as different from Western nations . 
We think ourselves more open , sentimental , cordial , and family oriented , but also more disorganized and blase , at times irresponsible and lazy . 
Still , we are Europeans . 
You can see that on the streets and squares of Kiev . 
Drivers now allow pedestrians to cross the street , as in Geneva or Munich ( while in Moscow people must still dash aside from onrushing cars impervious to pedestrian safety ) . 
Kiev now possesses a lively cafe life , and bright public places where people can relax and enjoy life . 
Young people learn English , German , French ; they study computers and suft the web in internet cafes . 
But this is a lyrical digression of a lover of Kiev . 
Lyrical observations aside , as a professional politician , I see deeper changes . 
Over the last decade we moved from complete aversion to the idea of reform to a policy of mutant reforms pursued for corrupt motives , to the gradual adaptation of legitimate Western practices . 
Administrative reform illustrates this well . 
At first , reform of the state incited hostility among both bureaucrats and ordinary citizens . 
A sharp and ill-considered reduction of the civil service began . 
Here was reform &quot; by the numbers &quot; : shrink the state , it was assumed , and government would run more smoothly . 
No one took into account the fact that countries like France and Switzerland somehow manage to thrive with large states . 
The critical factor is not the size of the state , but rather its organization and sense of purpose . 
By recognizing that taking a chain saw to state bureaus does not automatically improve governance , we reached the second stage of our reform process . 
Slowly , the state began to be reformed in a more thoughtful way . 
New departments and state secretaries with clearly designed purposes were introduced . 
This helped stabilize the work of government ministries . 
In the beginning , the authority given to these new posts was somewhat overstated in order to make their powers effective . 
Now their functioning has become more or less normal . 
Ukrainians may at times resent these impersonal modern mechanisms , but they increasingly ( if grudgingly ) recognize them as necessary . 
Sober-minded politician also accept this . 
Only radicals and populists  -  of which we retain too many  -  can afford a devil-may-care attitude toward making the state function more efficiently . 
Taming our radicals , and the radical impulse , has not been easy . 
Why ? 
For too long Ukraine was a province of the USSR and Tsarist empire ; the most important one , of course , but still a province . 
This affected our mentality , for radicalism is a by-product of the provincials &apos; inferiority complexes . 
An overwhelming sense of inferiority , and our efforts to deny it , inspired the most scandalous aspects of Ukrainian political life . 
The provincial cannot admit his inferiority and refuses to learn from others . 
As we shrug off our provincial defensiveness , we become more willing to accept the best that others have to offer . 
A century ago , the Ottoman Empire was derided as the &quot; sick man of Europe . &quot; 
Since 1991 , Ukrainians have sensed that many Europeans see Ukraine as having inherited this sorry title . 
Over the course of a decade we did , perhaps , make ourselves more ill through our own actions , but now we are recovering . 
The recently concluded elections , which pushed the Communists out of their dominant position in the Rada and sharply curtailed the power of the &quot; parties of power &quot; that surround President Kuchma , pushed our provincial radicals to the fringes of our politics . 
The parties of reform and of Europe triumphed . 
Feeling ourselves outcasts or at least on the margins of Europe , we seek to build a society without outsiders or outcasts . 
As a great ( and already American at that time ) writer Vladimir Nabokov wrote in the 1970s : &quot; From all the decrees of nature the most remarkable one is , possibly , the survival of the weakest . &quot; 
Walking that long , winding road to Europe has helped a weak new nation to strengthen and survive .
