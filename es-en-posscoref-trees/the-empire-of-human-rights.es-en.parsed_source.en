The Empire of Human Rights 
NEW YORK - Why are French , British , and American warships , but not Chinese or Malaysian warships , sitting near the Burmese coast loaded with food and other necessities for the victims of Cyclone Nargis ? 
Why has the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) been so slow and weak in its response to a natural calamity that ravaged one of its own members ? 
The French junior Human Rights Minister , Rama Yade , declared that the United Nations &quot; principle of the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; should be applied to Burma , forcibly if necessary . 
And the Malaysian opposition leader Lim Kit Siang has said that Asian countries &quot; inaction &quot; reflects dismally on all ASEAN leaders and governments . 
They can definitely do more . &quot; 
So , are Europeans and Americans simply more compassionate than Asians ? 
Given the West &apos;s record of horrendous warfare and often brutal imperialism , this seems unlikely . 
Moreover , the way ordinary Chinese rallied to help victims of the earthquake in Sichuan has been quite remarkable , as have been the spontaneous efforts of people in Burma to assist their fellow citizens , even as the military did very little . 
Buddhism stresses compassion and mercy as much as Christianity does . 
Indeed , none of the Asian members disagreed when the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 . 
The declaration held that &quot; recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom , justice , and peace in the world . &quot; 
Nevertheless , there may be cultural differences in understanding how compassion should be applied . The ideal of universal equality and rights does owe something to the history of Western civilization , from Socrates &quot; &quot; natural justice &quot; to Christianity and France &apos;s Declaration of the Rights of Man . 
Western peoples have not always lived up to their universalist ideals , but they have in modern times built institutions designed to implement them , in Europe and beyond . 
There is , so far , no Asia-wide institution to protect the human rights of Asians , let alone mankind . 
In fact , Chinese and other Asians frequently criticize the West for using human rights as an excuse to impose &quot; Western values &quot; on former colonial subjects . 
To be sure , such accusations are especially common in autocracies whose rulers , and their apologists , view the idea of universal human rights as a threat to their monopoly on power . 
But distrust of universalism in Asia is not confined to autocrats . 
In many Asian countries , favors invariably create obligations , which is perhaps why people are sometimes disinclined to interfere in the problems of others . 
You are obliged to take care of your family , your friends , or even your fellow countrymen . 
But the idea of universal charity is too abstract , and smacks of the kind of unwelcome interference that Western imperialists - and the Christian missionaries who followed them - practiced in the East for too long . 
The notion of &quot; Asian values , &quot; promoted mostly by Singaporean official scribes , was partly a critique of universalist Western claims . 
Asians , according to this theory , have their own values , which include thrift , deference to authority , the sacrifice of individual to collective interests , and the belief that countries should not stick their noses into others &quot; affairs . 
Hence , the hesitant response of Southeast Asian governments - and public opinion - to the Burmese disaster . 
One possible line of criticism of this kind of thinking is simply to claim the superiority of Western values . 
Amartya Sen , the Nobel Prize-winning economist , has pointed out that great Indian rulers , such as Ashoka ( third century BC ) and Akbar ( sixteenth century ) , advocated pluralism , tolerance , and reason long before the European Enlightenment . 
He has also observed that famines don &apos;t occur in democracies , because freedom of information helps to prevent them . 
Sen , not surprisingly , is a trenchant critic of the &quot; Asian values &quot; school . 
It has , nonetheless , become a commonly held opinion that democracy , like universal human rights , is a typically Western idea , and that Asian autocracy , as practiced in China , for example , is not only more suited to Asians , but also more efficient . 
Democratic governments are hampered by lobby groups , special interests , public opinion , party politics , and so forth , while Asian autocrats can make unpopular but necessary decisions . 
The two recent natural disasters in Burma and China have put this idea to a severe test . 
China has not fared too badly , largely because its government was forced by the Burmese example , bad publicity surrounding the Tibetan demonstrations , and the impending Olympic Games to allow far more freedom of information than it normally does . 
One can only hope that this crack of freedom will widen in time . 
Burma failed miserably , and , despite belated efforts to make the best of terrible circumstances , so has ASEAN . 
In the end , of course , it doesn &apos;t matter much whether or not we ascribe the failures of autocracy and non-intervention to anything specifically &quot; Asian . &quot; 
Whatever the cause , the consequences remain deplorable .
