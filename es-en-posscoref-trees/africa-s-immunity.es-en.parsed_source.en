Africa &apos;s Immunity 
ACCRA - The United States suffers rising job losses . 
Britain nationalizes its banks . 
Once high-flying small economies like Ireland , Hungary , and Iceland break down . 
Even robust China and India are experiencing slower growth , curtailed ambitions , and broken dreams . 
Yet , in sub-Saharan Africa , there are few hints of the global financial crisis that is consuming the capitalist world . 
In fashionable African cities , residential home prices remain stratospheric . 
A typical Western-style house in Kampala or Accra , for example , now costs an astonishing two to three times the price of a comparable home in , say , Cleveland or other cities in the American heartland . 
While home prices are crashing from Madrid to Dublin and Miami to Los Angeles , African prices remain near or at record-high levels . 
African banks , meanwhile , are rock-solid compared to their debt-heavy counterparts in the US and Europe . 
While international bankers went bust by making legions of bad loans , African bankers stuck to earning profits the old-fashioned way : paying very little to depositors , and earning a big &quot; spread &quot; by buying guaranteed government debt , which yielded healthy returns . 
Even government deficit spending - long the bane of Africa - seems positively puny compared to the massive debts that the US and some European countries face . 
The new Obama administration is proposing spending plans that would create a record US deficit of more than one trillion dollars - and this coming on top of the outgoing Bush administration &apos;s record deficit . 
And yet there are good reasons to believe that it is just a matter of time before Africa and its peoples experience the ill effects of the global crisis . 
From Ghana to Kenya , governments are having increased difficulty in raising money for infrastructure projects and selling official debt . 
Foreign investment in sub-Saharan Africa , which reached record levels in recent years , is retreating , which is evidence of investor caution , not any underlying lack of optimism about the region . 
And exports of raw materials to China , India , Europe , and the US - a key factor in Africa &apos;s recent growth surge - may suffer simply because the global slowdown means less consumption everywhere . 
All of these factors suggest that an African financial bust is possible . 
Popular equity investments , such as shares in Safaricom , are already trading at unexpectedly low levels . 
If real estate prices were to fall dramatically , a chain reaction could occur , taking down big and small investors alike , and over time causing wide suffering to ordinary Africans . 
Even assuming stability in real estate prices , the global crisis surely will cause a fall in remittances by Africans working good jobs in Europe , the US , Canada , Australia , and the Middle East . 
Remittances are already believed to be falling , which makes sense : immigrants in rich countries are and will be disproportionately hurt by slowing economic activity . 
Immigration itself may even slow dramatically , depending on the length and depth of the economic slowdown . 
Fewer Africans working in rich countries will automatically translate into less money circulating in African countries . 
The decline in remittances , however , cuts both ways . 
Remittances have long spurred inflation in many parts of Africa . 
A Ugandan doctor working in Norway , for instance , cares little about the cost of a beer in Kampala . 
He is also willing - and able - to pay more than a local doctor for services and , of course , a home in Uganda . 
Fewer remittances flowing into Uganda could mean less economic activity - or simply lower prices . 
The financial meltdown in the US , which incubated the global crisis , is either coming under control or threatening to mutate into a new , more virulent form that could destroy not only America &apos;s paper economy of trading and brokering , but also its real economy of goods and services . 
President Barack Obama , acting as if the latter scenario remains likely , is betting on large-scale government spending to prop up the real economy . 
If his administration succeeds , the chances that Africa will remain relatively unscathed will grow . 
Even if Obama fails , however , Africans should escape the worst of the global crisis , for both good reasons and bad . 
The good reasons have to do with African self-reliance and a growing awareness among scholars and policymakers that trade within the region - especially between urban and rural Africa - will ultimately deliver enormous benefits . 
Another factor working in Africa &apos;s favor is its private companies &quot; and consumers &quot; low dependence on borrowed money . 
People tend to pay cash for goods and services , however costly . 
In the US , loans for cars and homes - loans that now aren &apos;t being paid back - are the major factor behind the financial crisis . 
In Africa , very few people borrow money for such purchases . 
Africa &apos;s cash-based economy has in the past constrained development . 
After all , by allowing people to spend more than they have , borrowed money can fuel growth . 
But today , Africa &apos;s pay-as-you-go practices are a powerful defense against financial contagion . 
Another way of looking at Africa &apos;s paradoxical economic position is to admit that the region &apos;s historical marginalization within the international financial system - so costly in times of global plenty - is proving to be an unexpected benefit when the wealthiest of the world are sick unto death .
