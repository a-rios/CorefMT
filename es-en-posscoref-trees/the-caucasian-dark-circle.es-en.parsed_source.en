The Caucasian Dark Circle 
MOSCOW - The Russian authorities have recently begun showing off the massive security measures being implemented ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Black Sea resort of Sochi . 
They have good reason to be worried - and not only for the safety of athletes and spectators . 
The violence in the North Caucasus is becoming less a serious regional conflict and more an existential threat to the entire Russian Federation - an evolution that reflects almost all of the mistakes , failures , and crimes of the post-Soviet leadership . 
Two horrific wars with local separatists , from 1994-1996 and from 1999- 2006 , have been fought over Chechnya , presumably to secure Russia &apos;s territorial integrity . 
We Russians fought these wars in order to demonstrate to the Chechens that they , too , were citizens of Russia . 
We did so by destroying their cities and villages with artillery shells and aerial bombardment , and we abducted and killed civilians , their bodies often bearing evidence of torture . 
It should surprise no one that the Chechens , and other peoples of the Caucasus , do not feel very Russian . 
In reality , Russia has lost the war against the Chechen separatists . 
The winner was Ramzan Kadyrov , one of the field commanders in the fighting . 
Ostensibly , he is an appointee of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , but in reality he is virtually independent of the Kremlin , which pays him substantial financial support , not only for his formal declaration of loyalty , but also for his public embrace of Putin . 
The war against separatism in the North Caucasus has now evolved into the war against Islamic fundamentalism . 
Ignited by the violence of the Chechen wars , Islamic-sponsored terrorism has spread widely in the region , as Russian policies , similar to those during the Chechen war , increase the number of Islamists . 
President Dmitri Medvedev , for example , regularly calls for extremists to be &quot; burned to ashes , &quot; and for terrifyingly broad punishment , including of those &quot; washing linen and preparing soup for terrorists . &quot; 
Given the morality of federal forces ( or the lack thereof ) , Medvedev should have understood that such rhetoric could result only in a significant increase in brutality and extrajudicial killings all over the North Caucasus . 
The resulting mayhem has served only to spawn new suicide bombers willing to bring fresh terror to Russia &apos;s heartland . 
Indeed , the paradox today is that Islamists seem to be losing influence in the Arab world while strengthening their position in the North Caucasus , where the Kremlin has fought a twelve-year war without understanding the scope of the tragedy taking place - a civil and ethnic war for which the Kremlin itself bears significant responsibility . 
After all , the tribute that the Kremlin pays Kadyrov and the corrupted elites of the other Caucasian republics has purchased palaces and gold pistols for men who are driving the region &apos;s young , unemployed , and disadvantaged down the path of Islamic revolution . 
Across the Caucasus , a generation has grown up absolutely lost to Russia - and increasingly susceptible to recruitment into the ranks of Allah &apos;s warriors . 
A nearly unbridgeable mental gap now separates Russians and Caucasian young people . 
Young Muscovites march carrying banners that read &quot; Fuck the Caucasus ! &quot; 
Young Caucasians , perceiving themselves as a winning side in the Northern Caucasus , behave in increasingly provocative and aggressive ways on the streets of Russian cities . 
In the hearts and minds of people on both sides , Russians and Caucasians are becoming increasingly alienated from each other . 
But neither the Kremlin nor its North Caucasian allies are ready for formal separation . 
The former remains wedded to its phantom imperial illusions about a &quot; zone of privileged interests &quot; extending far beyond Russia &apos;s borders , while the latter , starting with Kadyrov , rule as independent autocrats happy to accept handouts from the Russian state budget . 
The irony is that , like the Kremlin and its allies , the Islamists do not want to separate . 
They dream about a Caliphate that would include much more of the Russian Federation than the North Caucasus . 
Recently , Medvedev convened a large public meeting in Vladikavkaz . 
He accused anonymous enemies ( his anonymous &quot; they &quot; presumably included Western governments ) of pursuing an agenda to destroy Russia , and he encouraged his security officials to push back . 
In Medvedev &apos;s mental universe , savage reprisals today will somehow turn the North Caucasus into a zone of international ski tourism tomorrow . 
That is not likely to happen . 
The day after Medvedev &apos;s departure from Vladikavkaz , terrorists blew up the ski lifts at the resort in Nalchik , not far from Sochi , where , for Russia , much more than winning medals will be at stake in 2014 .
