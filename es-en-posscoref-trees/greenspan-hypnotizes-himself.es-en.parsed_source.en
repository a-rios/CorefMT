Greenspan Hypnotizes Himself 
On the eve of the last G-7 meeting in London , US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan did a startling about-face by soft-pedaling America &apos;s trade deficit . 
&quot; Market pressures ... appear poised to stabilize and over the longer run possibly to decrease the US current-account deficit and its attendant financing requirements , &quot; he said . 
What is going on here ? 
To be sure , the US trade figures have improved somewhat . 
The expected December trade deficit is $ 57 billion - an improvement on the record $ 60.3 billion gap in November . 
And the November figure will be adjusted downward because of a recently discovered statistical error by Canadian authorities . 
But politics , not economics , explains why the Fed chairman changed his tune about America &apos;s weak external position . 
Mr. Greenspan &apos;s statement in Frankfurt in November alarmed senior European Central Bank ( ECB ) officials , who considered it a &quot; provocation &quot; - one that promptly sent the dollar into an unwanted tailspin . 
The last thing the Fed Maestro needed was a repeat performance on the eve of the G-7 - a meeting that is supposed to exemplify international co-operation . 
So Mr. Greenspan decided to extend a peace offering to the Europeans . 
Politics also explains Mr. Greenspan &apos;s pre-G-7 comment that &quot; the voice of fiscal restraint , barely audible a year ago , has at least partially regained volume . &quot; 
The Fed chairman is &quot; hearing voices &quot; because he is a team player who wants to encourage US budget cutting . 
How would it look if he had openly expressed misgivings about Bush &apos;s plan to cut the budget deficit in half by 2009 just days before it was made public ? 
What Mr. Greenspan chose to overlook , however , is that most experts are extremely - and rightly - skeptical of the Bush plan , which leaves out big-ticket items such as the cost of the Iraq War , and uses an unrealistic benchmark from which to measure the alleged 50 % cutback . 
Timing the budget &apos;s release for just after the G-7 made for a harmonious London meeting in which both Americans and Europeans could claim that the US was taking care of business - that is , its twin fiscal and current-account deficits . 
The Europeans gladly went along with this charade because they now fear dollar depreciation more than global imbalance . 
So far , Europe &apos;s fragile economic recovery has been based largely on exports . 
The euro &apos;s rapid appreciation against the dollar threatens to undermine this foundation . 
But internal European Union studies indicate that European exports are more closely linked to changes in external demand than the euro-dollar exchange rate . 
So long as external demand holds up - and recent growth numbers from China and the US are positive in this regard - Europe &apos;s exports should continue to perform well . 
In any case , protecting exports by resisting euro appreciation - or , more precisely , dollar depreciation - is a poor way to promote economic growth . 
A strong currency keeps both inflation and ECB interest hikes at bay . 
Moreover , because crude oil is priced in US dollars , a rise in the euro means a fall in energy costs . 
This , too , helps European growth . 
Dollar depreciation improves Europe &apos;s terms of trade and real income . 
America &apos;s fiscal and external deficits will not disappear just because the chief magician at the Federal Reserve waves his wand and says abracadabra . 
On the contrary , the longer Greenspan plays down America &apos;s dangerous macroeconomic imbalances with happy talk , the more damage they will ultimately inflict on the global economy . 
What the world needs now is the realist Greenspan of Frankfurt , not the cheerleader Greenspan of London . 
Simply put , there must be dollar depreciation to keep global imbalances in check . 
Instead of catering to European fears and prejudices about exchange rates , the Fed chairman should put politics aside and stick to sound economics .
