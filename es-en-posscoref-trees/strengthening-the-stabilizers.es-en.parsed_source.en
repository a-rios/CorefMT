Strengthening the Stabilizers 
PARIS - The G-20 summit in Cannes in early November is a major opportunity to address the mandate , governance , and institutional capacity of the Financial Stability Board , the international body that monitors , and makes recommendations about enhancing , the international financial system . 
The meeting is particularly timely , because the FSB will soon be under new leadership , as its current chairman , Mario Draghi , takes over in November as President of the European Central Bank . 
In the midst of the financial meltdown in 2008-2009 , the G-20 established the FSB , building on its predecessor , the Financial Stability Forum , and charged it with coordinating urgent international regulatory-reform efforts to ensure greater financial stability and global consistency of rules . 
Even as the G-20 wrestles with the challenges of the global economic slowdown and the euro crisis , the mandate to the FSB remains central to a substantial financial-reform agenda - and to avoiding national and regional divergence in areas critical to the global financial system &apos;s stability . 
The FSB has been criticized for lacking enforcement capability . 
But , in today &apos;s world of sovereign states , treaties creating new international institutions with supranational powers are not realistic alternatives . 
Moreover , the FSB &apos;s achievements are significant . 
Its agenda is rapidly expanding , and it is becoming an influential and permanent component of the international economic and financial architecture , even as challenging questions surround its future . 
Pragmatic steps to clarify the FSB &apos;s mandate and enhance its operational effectiveness can and should be taken . 
Today , the FSB is without legal standing ( it is only the product of a political statement ) . 
Institutionally , it is simply an extension of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel . 
Its internal governance processes are underdeveloped and lack transparency . 
As the only entity that integrates central banks , supervisors , treasuries of major economies , and international standard-setting bodies , the FSB is uniquely positioned to set priorities on financial regulation , provide regulatory coherence across the financial sector , oversee consistent implementation , and , in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund , to assess systemic vulnerabilities . 
But , while it should identify regulatory gaps and encourage more proactive work by the various standard-setting bodies , it should not take on daily operational responsibilities . 
It should , however , foster a culture of consultation with industry as a necessary dimension of legitimacy , which implies more transparent approaches to considering the market impact of proposed standards . 
Effective execution of such an ambitious mandate is particularly important in view of two emerging G-20 priorities for the FSB : regulatory initiatives with respect to the functioning of markets , including so-called &quot; shadow banking &quot; ( the less regulated forms of private financing ) , and new mechanisms to foster consistent implementation of standards . 
Expectations of a greater FSB focus on shadow banking stem not only from non-bank financial institutions &quot; role in fueling the 2008-2009 crisis , but also from the concern that stiffer capital and liquidity requirements for banks might shift risk away from the financial sector &apos;s regulated core . 
This will require carefully balancing the need to mitigate risks in the unregulated sector with the benefits that its efficiency and innovation provide to the financial system . 
The FSB , along with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , has been quietly considering new mechanisms for monitoring implementation of standards , particularly in the context of Basel III rules . 
FSB membership should imply accountability in implementation of standards . 
In the absence of formal enforcement powers , the pragmatic alternative is to develop mechanisms for monitoring implementation of standards on an ongoing basis , and to incorporate systematic , impartial peer reviews . 
The Cannes Summit should articulate a renewed commitment to consistent implementation of agreed regulatory reforms , and to minimizing divergence in national regulation that could create systemic risks or significant competitive advantage . 
The G-20 should provide the political support to develop a framework that relies on monitoring , consultation , mutual oversight , reporting , and publication . 
It is in the financial industry &apos;s interest to support the development of these mechanisms as a means to address the competitive implications of divergent national regulation . 
Finally , the G-20 should provide the FSB with adequate institutional capacity to address its tasks , but without creating a bureaucracy . 
The first order of business is to endorse a capable and dedicated new FSB chairman . 
Beyond that , the FSB should be given legal capacity through proper incorporation - an institutionally intermediate point between its purely political status now and the extreme of a treaty organization . 
This would enable to FSB to hire the best possible talent , receive funding from governments , and enter into more formal arrangements with other international bodies in order to carry out its responsibilities more effectively .
