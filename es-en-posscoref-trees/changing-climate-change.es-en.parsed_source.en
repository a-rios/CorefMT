Changing Climate Change 
The 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1990 , and 2005 is likely to be the warmest ever . 
This year , we &apos;ve gotten a taste of the many kinds of dangers that lie ahead : more extreme hurricanes , massive droughts , forest fires , spreading infectious diseases , and floods . 
The climate is changing , and more is yet to come . 
The world &apos;s governments will meet in Montreal at the end of November to plot the next steps , including specific measures that the world could adopt if the Bush administration abandoned its willful neglect of this critical issue . 
Climate change is equated with &quot; global warming , &quot; but much more than warming is involved . 
The rising concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is leading to more extreme storms , higher-intensity hurricanes , rising ocean levels , melting glaciers and ice sheets , droughts , floods and other climate changes . 
Even the chemistry of the land and ocean is changing , with the ocean becoming more acidic - thus threatening coral reefs - as a result of higher carbon dioxide . 
The specific patterns of change are not known precisely , but the risks of continuing on our current global course are widely appreciated . 
Yet the United States has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol , which does little to change the long-term course of events on the planet , since it calls for only small steps up to the year 2012 . 
Under the terms of the UN treaty on climate change , the signatories - virtually the whole world - are to gather each year to discuss the treaty &apos;s implementation . 
The conference in Montreal - the 11th such meeting - should look beyond 2012 , so that the world gets onto a safe and sustainable long-term climate path . 
The actions that are needed are difficult to introduce , because they go to the heart of the world &apos;s use of energy , particularly its use of fossil fuels ( coal , oil , and gas ) , which , when burned , release carbon dioxide - the key source of rising greenhouse gases - into the atmosphere . 
Yet the world economy depends on fossil fuels , and developing countries will need to use more , not less , of them as their economies grow . 
Even if the world runs out of oil and gas in the coming years , coal will prove to be plentiful , and solid coal can be converted at relatively low cost to liquid fuels for automobiles and other uses . 
Unfortunately , clean , renewable energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide , such as wind power and geothermal power , are not yet sufficient . 
Solar power can be produced on the required scale but is too expensive under current technologies . 
Nuclear power is relatively cheap , and could be plentiful , but poses huge dangers for increased proliferation of nuclear-weapons materials . 
So : fossil fuels are plentiful , but harmful ; renewable sources like wind are good for the climate but not plentiful . 
Solar power is plentiful but not cheap . 
Nuclear power is plentiful but not safe . 
Improved technologies can offer a way out of this bind , but only if we think and act ahead . 
There are two main kinds of technologies that look most promising . 
The first is energy conservation through more fuel-efficient vehicles . 
New hybrid automobiles , pioneered by Toyota , use both gasoline and electric power to boost gasoline efficiency by approximately two-fold . 
A massive changeover to more fuel-efficient vehicles would make a big difference , especially as the numbers of vehicles on the road soars in China , India , and other developing countries . 
The second big technology that could make a major difference is called &quot; carbon capture and storage . &quot; 
The idea is to &quot; capture &quot; the carbon dioxide that is emitted in power plants and other big factories when fossil fuels are burned , thereby preventing it from entering the atmosphere . 
The captured carbon is then pumped into underground storage sites such as empty oil fields and other suitable locations . 
All of the key aspects of the technology - capturing the carbon dioxide , putting it into pipelines for shipment , and then depositing it underground - have already been demonstrated , but they have not yet been tried , and proven , on a large scale . 
There is strong evidence , however , that it would not cost the world huge amounts to undertake large-scale carbon capture and storage . 
The problem is timing . 
The changeover of the world &apos;s vehicles to hybrid and other efficient technologies will take decades , not years . 
If we procrastinate , the dangers posed by climate change will confront us as we talk , debate , and plan . 
The world needs to start acting soon - very soon - if it is to head off the major threats . 
All major regions of the world will need to be involved . 
Today &apos;s developing countries are not yet major emitters of carbon dioxide , but with economic growth they will become so . 
Therefore , all countries , both developed and developing , need to do their part , with rich countries helping poor countries cover the financial costs of adjustment . 
Plenty of carbon dioxide will be emitted into the atmosphere as the world &apos;s climate negotiators fly to and from the Montreal meeting . 
Let &apos;s press our governments to make real progress when they meet ; otherwise they will merely be adding to the problem .
