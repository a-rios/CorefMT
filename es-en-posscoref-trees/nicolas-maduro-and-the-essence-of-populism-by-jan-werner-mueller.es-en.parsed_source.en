Populism Without the People 
PRINCETON - Nicol치s Maduro &apos;s narrow victory in Venezuela &apos;s presidential election raises an important question ( quite apart from the opposition &apos;s question as to whether Maduro really won ) : Can populism thrive without a genuinely popular , charismatic leader , or are movements like Ch치vismo doomed to fade into insignificance once they have lost their quasi-deities ? 
For many observers , populism is unthinkable without a strong , direct bond between an anti-establishment leader and citizens who feel neglected by mainstream political parties . 
Yet the role of leadership in populism is vastly overestimated . 
Indeed , given populism &apos;s importance as a political phenomenon , that view , along with two others - that populism is somehow a call for direct democracy , and that populists can only protest , but never govern - needs to be challenged . 
Populism , unlike , say , liberalism or Marxism , is not a coherent body of distinct political ideas . 
While populists might be particularly prone to advocating facile solutions , they hardly have a monopoly on that tactic . 
Moreover , impugning populists &quot; intelligence and seriousness only plays into their hands : See how the arrogant , entrenched elites , they will counter , dismiss the common sense of the people . 
Populism cannot be understood at the level of policies ; rather , it is a particular way of imagining politics . 
It pits the innocent , always hard-working people against both a corrupt elite ( who do not really work , other than to further their own interests ) and those on the very bottom of society ( who also do not work and live off others ) . 
In the populist imagination , both the very top and the very bottom of society are not really a part of it : they are directly or indirectly supported by outside powers ( think of pro-European liberal elites in Central and Eastern Europe ) ; more obviously , they are immigrants or minorities , like the Roma . 
Typically , in the populist political imagination , elites disproportionately care for those who , like themselves , do not really belong . 
Europe &apos;s elites are regularly accused of lavishing benefits on ethnic minorities in the name of protecting their rights . 
America &apos;s Tea Party populists often imagine an unholy alliance of left-liberal , bi-coastal elites and the African-American underclass ( an alliance that in their eyes is embodied in President Barack Obama ) . 
A leader who can represent this purely moral - as opposed to political - image helps to provide a focus for voters . 
It mattered that Ch치vez reassured the masses that &quot; I am a little of all of you . &quot; 
Yet it could be someone else , or a group ; or it could be no one in particular ( who really leads the Tea Party ? ) . 
Voters who support populist movements do so because they believe that current elites fail truly to represent them . 
They are not against representative democracy as such : they just want different representatives - people whom they consider morally pure . 
Thus , calls for more popular participation are not essential to populism ; rather , they are a symptom of perceived exclusion ( which might well be a reality , especially in Latin America ) . 
Where direct democracy is very much a part of normal politics - in Switzerland , for example - populist parties have been doing better , not worse , than elsewhere . 
It is similarly misguided to think that populist politicians , once in power , will not be able to govern effectively , because they have emerged from protest parties whose agendas are defined entirely by what they oppose . 
Rather , what is distinctive about populists in power is that they attend only to their clientele ( the rest of the population is utterly undeserving ) and ride roughshod over checks and balances . 
From a populist perspective , this makes perfect sense : Why should they accept checks on their power if they represent the authentic will of the people ? 
Populists can live with representative democracy ; what they cannot accept is political pluralism and the notion of legitimate opposition . 
It was this tendency to demonize opponents , not particular policies favoring the poor , that made Ch치vez a populist . 
In Finland , to take another example , it is the claim of uniquely authentic representation , not criticism of the European Union , that makes the revealingly named True Finns a populist party . 
Likewise , the Italian populist Beppe Grillo &apos;s attempt to empower ordinary citizens is not a cause for concern ; but his claim that his Five Star Movement deserves nothing less than 100 % of seats in parliament , because all other contenders are corrupt and immoral , certainly is . 
It is this feature of populism - the idea that the people want only one thing , and that only true representatives can give it to them - that explains a symmetry ( often evoked , but seldom spelled out ) between populism and technocratic government . 
Just as technocrats assume that there is only one right solution to every policy challenge - hence political debate is not necessary - so , for populists , the people have one , and only one , uncorrupted will . 
Liberal democracy assumes just the opposite : space for different perspectives - and for political alternatives .
