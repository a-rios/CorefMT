Melting on Top of the World 
POTSDAM - In 1845 , Captain Sir John Franklin of the British Royal Navy led 128 men on two iron-plated steam ships , Erebus and Terror , into the Arctic , where they eventually disappeared . 
The voyage was the culmination of four centuries of failed attempts to navigate the Northwest Passage - a direct route from Europe to Asia across the Arctic Ocean - and remains one of the greatest tragedies in the history of polar exploration . 
Today , a far greater Arctic tragedy is unfolding : the Arctic sea-ice cap is melting . 
Last month , an unprecedented new low was reached after decades of decline . 
Indeed , the ice cap &apos;s area has decreased by half since the 1980 &quot; s , when summer sea-ice still extended over roughly seven million square kilometers , as opposed to less than four million today . 
It is now likely smaller than it has been for at least a millennium and a half . 
In 2007 , the Northwest Passage was ice-free for the first time in living memory . 
Boats of all sizes - including cruise ships - have sailed through easily in summers since then . 
Walt Meier of the United States &quot; National Snow and Ice Data Center describes today &apos;s ice cap as &quot; crushed ice . &quot; 
And it is getting thinner . 
In the last three decades , its volume has shrunk by roughly three-quarters . 
As the University of Laval &apos;s Louis Fortier puts it , &quot; we are three-quarters of the way to ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean . &quot; 
In addition to the sea-ice loss , satellite data show that Greenland &apos;s three-kilometer-thick continental ice sheet is also melting at a record rate . 
In July , 97 % of the sheet &apos;s surface was affected . 
The meltwater runoff in western Greenland was so strong that it swept away an important road bridge across the Watson River . 
This ice loss , caused largely by human-induced global warming , has far-reaching environmental , geopolitical , and economic consequences . 
For starters , Greenland &apos;s meltwater is flowing into the ocean , raising global sea levels . 
As temperatures have increased , the sea level &apos;s rise has accelerated from one centimeter per decade in the early twentieth century to more than three centimeters in each of the last two decades - an overall increase of nearly 20 centimeters since 1900 . 
While the numbers may seem small , the rise significantly increases the likelihood of severe flooding along vulnerable coasts worldwide . 
Greenland &apos;s meltwater accounts for one-fifth of the global sea-level rise over the last decade . 
If its ice sheet melted completely , sea levels would rise by seven meters - meaning that we cannot afford to lose even a small fraction of the ice sheet . 
Meanwhile , satellite data show that Antarctica &apos;s ice sheet , which is ten times larger than Greenland &apos;s , is losing ice as well . 
The vanishing Arctic sea ice also affects the atmosphere . 
Less ice reflects less sunlight , and more open ocean absorbs more heat , which is then released into the atmosphere , affecting wind and pressure patterns throughout the northern hemisphere . 
In a recent study , Jennifer Francis and Stephen Vavrus showed that the northern hemisphere polar jet stream , an air current that flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America , Europe , and Asia , has begun to show larger and more persistent meanders . 
This increases the likelihood of extreme weather events , like Russia &apos;s heat wave and Pakistan &apos;s floods in 2010 , which affected millions of people . 
Further exacerbating the problem , the disappearance of Arctic sea-ice has triggered a rush to secure newly accessible resources , particularly fossil fuels , which are a primary cause of global warming . 
( It has even revived efforts to find the wreckage of Franklin &apos;s lost ships . ) 
The recent Global Energy Assessment , released by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis , shows that combating global warming while providing affordable energy worldwide is technologically and economically feasible . 
But the energy transformation must begin now . 
The longer powerful interests deny humanity &apos;s contribution to global warming , the more difficult it will be to arrest and reverse its effects . 
One hopes that the satellite footage of the Arctic meltdown will help to inspire serious action .
