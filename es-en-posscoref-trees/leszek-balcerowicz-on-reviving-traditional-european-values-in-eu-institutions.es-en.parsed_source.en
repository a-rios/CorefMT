Europe &apos;s Non-Rhetorical Values 
WARSAW - The debate about Europe &apos;s future is burdened by misleading and emotionally charged rhetoric , with vague talk of &quot; more Europe &quot; hampering productive discussion about European countries &quot; real problems . 
Indeed , beyond the loaded language lie fundamental questions that have yet to be answered convincingly . 
What exactly would &quot; a federal Europe &quot; entail ? 
Is &quot; European solidarity &quot; a euphemism for the transfer union that Germany opposes , or for massive bailouts by the European Central Bank ? 
Such rhetoric usually displays a centralist bias , with the pursuit of &quot; more Europe &quot; depicted as the only way that the European Union can compete economically with politically centralized countries like the United States and China . 
But this confuses economic competitiveness with military power . 
In order to reap the benefits of European integration , it must be achieved through individual interactions , economic and otherwise , facilitated by the removal of regulatory barriers . 
The centralist approach disregards the vast discrepancies in economic performance among EU countries - and ignores the fact that one finds more economic success stories among Europe &apos;s smaller countries than among its large ones . 
Within the eurozone , cumulative GDP growth since 2008 has ranged from -23.6 % in Greece to 5.2 % in Slovakia ; outside the eurozone , it has ranged from -4.1 % in the United Kingdom to 12.5 % in Poland . 
The economies of Poland , Slovakia , the Baltic states , Bulgaria , Sweden , and Germany have all grown faster than that of the US , while Hungary , Denmark , and most eurozone countries have registered negative growth . 
These variations are rooted in differences in national policies , which highlights the fundamental flaw in the idea that solutions to European countries &quot; problems lie mainly at the EU level . 
In the US , the federal government does not take responsibility for solving states &quot; individual problems ; indeed , the states that have been hardest hit by the crisis have undertaken their own reforms . 
Likewise , there are no &quot; European &quot; solutions to , say , Italy &apos;s problems . 
Italy needs Italian solutions , just as Greece needs Greek solutions , Portugal needs Portuguese solutions , and so on . 
European arrangements must not weaken countries &quot; incentives to address the challenges facing them - and that means exercising extreme caution when it comes to bailing out eurozone economies . 
Current discussions also tend to ignore - and even distort - the values that European institutional arrangements are supposed to serve . 
&quot; More Europe &quot; is not a goal in itself . 
For any believer in traditional European values , individual liberties - including economic freedom - and their associated responsibilities constitute the ultimate criteria for developing and assessing institutions , from the local to the European level . 
At the heart of the European project lies a commitment to the single market , the subsidiarity principle , and the &quot; four freedoms , &quot; as well as other traditional liberties such as freedom of speech and religion . 
These values are universal ; there is nothing specifically &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; or &quot; German &quot; about them . 
Moreover , embedding these values in European institutional arrangements demands no sacrifices in terms of long-term GDP growth and employment . 
On the contrary , experience has demonstrated that economic liberalization and de-politicization ( including reducing the share of public expenditure ) is vital to lasting recovery . 
But there is no way to predict whether Europe &apos;s leaders will adopt this strategy . 
After all , the EU &apos;s future depends on its members &quot; policies , which , in turn , depend on their diverse and variable political situations . 
What is certain is that delaying much-needed reforms would be more than risky ; it would spell disaster for the eurozone . 
Indeed , given Europe &apos;s accumulated public debt and its rapidly aging population , maintaining the status quo would serve only to intensify economic crisis , threatening the euro &apos;s very existence . 
Even if European institutions like the ECB continued to extend rescue operations , they could not compensate for a lack of reform . 
They would , however , aggravate social and political turmoil in the eurozone , with Europeans increasingly challenging such operations &quot; legitimacy . 
It is against this background that the risks inherent in different kinds of reform should be assessed . 
Despite the chorus of voices condemning austerity , labor-market flexibility , and so on , there is a reasonable chance that these are the reforms that will be pursued . 
The problem countries in the EU have been moving in this direction , and their reforms &quot; success is largely proportionate to the speed with which they have been introduced . 
The examples of Poland , Estonia , Sweden , and Germany , among others , demonstrate that early reforms can yield huge social payoffs . 
Europe &apos;s future will ultimately be decided by the balance of competing political pressures , particularly at the national level . 
As it stands , there is no shortage of resistance to freedom-oriented reform and pressure to pursue statist policies . 
If believers in traditional European values fail to ensure that their voices , too , are heard , hazy rhetoric will continue to overshadow constructive debate of the EU &apos;s problems - and misguided policies will continue to undermine Europe &apos;s prospects .
