A Global Green New Deal 
NAIROBI - With unemployment soaring , bankruptcies climbing , and stock markets in free-fall , it may at first glance seem sensible to ditch the fight against climate change and put environmental investments on hold . 
But this would be a devastating mistake of immediate , as well as inter-generational , proportions . 
Far from burdening an already over-stressed , over-stretched global economy , environmental investments are exactly what is needed to get people back to work , get order books flowing , and assist in powering economies back to health . 
In the past , concern for the environment was viewed as a luxury ; today , it is a necessity - a point grasped by some , but by no means all , economic architects yet . 
A big slice of President Barack Obama &apos;s $ 825 billion stimulus package for the United States includes a boost to renewable energy , &quot; weatherizing &quot; a million homes , and upgrading the country &apos;s inefficient electricity grid . 
Such investments could generate an estimated five million &quot; green-collar &quot; jobs , provide a shot in the arm for the construction and engineering industries , and get America back into the equally serious business of combating climate change and achieving energy security . 
The Republic of Korea , which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years , has also spotted the green lining to grim economic times . 
President Lee Myung-Bak &apos;s government plans to invest $ 38 billion employing people to clean up four major rivers and reduce disaster risks by building embankments and water-treatment facilities . 
Other elements of Lee &apos;s plan include construction of eco-friendly transportation networks , such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks , and generating energy using waste methane from landfills . 
The package also counts on investments in hybrid vehicle technologies . 
Similar pro-employment &quot; Green New Deal &quot; packages have been lined up in China , Japan , and the United Kingdom . 
They are equally relevant to developing economies in terms of jobs , fighting poverty , and creating new opportunities at a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports . 
In South Africa , the government-backed 
This work is set to expand as more than 40 million tons of invasive alien plants are harvested for power-station fuel . 
As a result , an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity , equal to 2 % of the country &apos;s electricity needs , will be generated , along with more than 5,000 jobs . 
So it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure , energy systems , and ecosystems as among the best bets for recovery . 
Others may be unsure about the potential returns from investing in ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage or in renewable energy for the 80 % of Africans who have no access to electricity . 
Still others may simply be unaware of how to precisely follow suit . 
In early February , the United Nations Environment Program will convene some of the world &apos;s leading economists at the UN &apos;s headquarters in New York . 
A strategy for a Global Green New Deal , tailored to different national challenges , will be fleshed out in order to assist world leaders and ministers craft stimulus packages that work on multiple fronts . 
The Global Green New Deal , which UNEP launched as a concept in October 2008 , responds to the current economic malaise . 
Spent wisely , however , these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformational trends , setting the stage for a more sustainable , urgently needed Green Economy for the twenty-first century . 
The trillions of dollars that have been mobilized to address current woes , together with the trillions of investors &quot; dollars waiting in the wings , represent an opportunity that was unthinkable only 12 months ago : the chance to steer a more resource-efficient and intelligent course that can address problems ranging from climate change and natural-resource scarcity to water shortages and biodiversity loss . 
Blindly pumping the current bail-out billions into old industries and exhausted economic models will be throwing good money after bad while mortgaging our children &apos;s future . 
Instead , political leaders must use these windfalls to invest in innovation , promote sustainable businesses , and encourage new patterns of decent , long-lasting employment .
