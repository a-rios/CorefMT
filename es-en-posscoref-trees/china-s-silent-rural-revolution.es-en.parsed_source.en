China \ u0027s Silent Rural Revolution 
When China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress ( NPC ) concluded its annual meeting recently , it voted to enshrine protection of human rights and private property in the constitution . 
But other major changes in China &apos;s development strategies that appear to be taking place have attracted far less notice . 
China &apos;s current leadership , one year after coming to power , has criticized &quot; the single-minded pursuit of GDP growth &quot; over the past decade and unveiled a new approach to modernization characterized as &quot; balanced , human-centered , and environmentally friendly . &quot; 
The change in priorities - and outsiders &apos; tendency to overlook it - is not difficult to understand . 
The world is fascinated by China &apos;s economic miracle , but it is much less interested in the costs associated with the country &apos;s 8-9 % annual growth rate in the past 25 years . 
For instance , the energy consumption of every unit of Chinese industrial output is close to three times the global average . 
In may places , the environment has been devastated almost beyond recovery . 
Similarly , a recent Chinese bestseller , A Survey of Chinese Peasants , reveals the tremendous human costs of China &apos;s modernization drive . 
The book caught the attention of both the elites and the mass public with its heart-breaking stories of the suffering endured by 900 million farmers and its bold criticism of the government &apos;s rural policies . 
Beyond the glamorous skyscrapers of Beijing , Shanghai , and other urban centers , the majority of Chinese who live in the countryside have gained little from the material progress of the past two decades . 
On the contrary , the initial benefits that peasants gained from the rural reforms of the late 1970 &apos;s and early 1980 &apos;s have disappeared ; real income among farmers has dropped in recent years as their production costs rise and agricultural prices decline . 
In most parts of China , farming can no longer sustain a respectable standard of living . 
Most worrying is the ever-growing tax burden placed on the rural population . 
While average agricultural income grew by 90 % in the 1994-97 period , the rural tax burden jumped by 800 % . 
More than 300 taxes and fees have been imposed on peasants by all levels of government . 
For example , some townships demand 14 kinds of fees to register a marriage . 
Today , a farmer &apos;s annual income is only one-sixth that of an urban dweller &apos;s , but he has to pay three times more in taxes . 
This comes in addition to many other financial burdens exacted at the local level . 
Indeed , 25 years of reforms have changed nothing of China &apos;s &quot; one country with two systems &quot; - a model that segregates China &apos;s urban centers from its agricultural areas , with development of the former realized at the expense of the latter . 
If we use what is called the &quot; Gini coefficient &quot; to measure this income gap , with &quot; 0 &quot; indicating perfect equality of income distribution and &quot; 1 &quot; meaning perfect inequality , the number for China is 0.454 in 2002 . 
This is an internationally recognized level of &quot; absolute disparity . &quot; 
India , long known for gross disparities between rich and poor , has a Gini coefficient that has hovered around 0.30 to 0.32 over the past five decades . 
So today &apos;s China is a much less equitable society than India . 
A recent study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences concluded that China &apos;s urban-rural income gap is the worst on earth , maybe only slightly better than Zimbabwe . 
The irony here is that China is widely hailed as a success story , while Zimbabwe is generally viewed as a failed state . 
Such an unfair distribution of wealth based on economic exploitation , social injustice and political exclusion has caused silent but persistent resistance by Chinese peasants . 
They protest , they petition , and they participate in local riots when all other means are exhausted . 
Yet little changes . 
As a result , the &quot; peasant question &quot; is now threatening social stability and is potentially explosive in a way reminiscent of when Mao organized his revolution around peasant disaffection with the rural policies of the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek . 
In response , Premier Wen Jiabao announced a series of measures during the NPC , ranging from phasing out agricultural taxes over the next five years to measures aimed at increasing farmers &apos; income . 
But while official attention to rural poverty is music to the ears of the poor , experience shows that such promises are usually inadequate . 
Wen &apos;s predecessor , Zhu Ronji , also said that his &quot; biggest headache &quot; was how to reduce the rural tax burden and increase peasant income . 
Yet the situation only worsened . 
China &apos;s government must acknowledge that deep income inequality and rural poverty is no longer exclusively an economic problem , but threatens social peace and political stability . 
Comprehensive reform is the only way out . 
Unless China commits to greater political openness , allowing the poor and disadvantaged to voice their concerns , represent themselves , and monitor policy implementation , it will continue to be jeopardized by a false and perilous prosperity .
