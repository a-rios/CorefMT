Forging Syria &apos;s Opposition 
TEL AVIV - Syria &apos;s crisis is now a year old , with close to 10,000 people , mostly civilians , dead and no end in sight . 
The country is at a stalemate : the opposition is unable to topple President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , and Assad &apos;s forces are unable to quash the resistance . 
Both sides are adamant : the opposition is determined to bring down a regime that it views as illegitimate , sectarian , corrupt , tyrannical , and stained with blood , while the regime &apos;s hard-line core believes that by persevering it will ultimately silence the opposition , whereas any concession would jeopardize its very existence . 
Its downfall , they believe , would mean dispossession and death for the regime &apos;s leadership and for a large part of the minority Alawite community from which it is drawn . 
Assad and his cohorts are encouraged by the world &apos;s failure to respond effectively to their brutal suppression of the revolt in Homs , and have proceeded to inflict vicious punishment on its survivors as a warning to opponents elsewhere . 
This may cow some of Syria &apos;s civilian population in the short term , but it will serve only to exacerbate popular rage , and thus to increase the prospect of a bloody reckoning with Assad and his cronies down the line . 
Today &apos;s brutal stalemate is likely to continue for some time . 
Diplomatic and humanitarian missions led by former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Valerie Amos seem as ineffective as earlier efforts by the international community and the Arab League to mitigate the conflict or to facilitate a political solution . 
To be sure , the authorities have suffered some defections , with the most significant coming soon after the violence in Homs reached its peak , when the deputy energy minister resigned and joined the opposition . 
But , while defections have occurred among the officer corps as well , the regime has maintained its basic cohesiveness . 
The army , the security apparatus , and the Alawite community are still solidly supportive . 
A large part of the Syrian population - the middle class in Damascus and Aleppo , the Christians , and other minorities - are passive or sitting on the fence , worried that the alternative to the status quo is chaos , civil war , and possibly a radical Islamist takeover . 
And Russia and China continue to provide diplomatic cover , with Iran sending material support . 
Life in Damascus , despite increasing shortages , seems almost normal . 
The regime &apos;s foes , on the other hand , seem undeterred by the killings , continuing to stage protests across Syria . 
Armed opposition is spreading , albeit slowly . 
The Western countries , Turkey , and most of the Arab world are incensed by the brutal killing and destruction , and pressure to intervene and stiffen international sanctions is building . 
But regional and international pressure on Assad has been ineffective . 
While the Arab League seemed to act decisively last November when it suspended Syria &apos;s membership , the military-observer mission that it sent to Syria was a farce . 
Turkey &apos;s initiatives have lost steam , and the United States and its European allies are merely going through the diplomatic motions ; in practice , their efforts imply little serious impact on the regime . 
America and the West claim that they cannot act significantly without a UN mandate , which Russia and China are denying them by vetoing anti-Syrian resolutions in the Security Council . 
But the truth is that governments in Washington , London , Paris , and elsewhere could do much more without a Security Council resolution . 
Perhaps most strikingly , while some governments have closed their embassies in Damascus ( citing safety considerations ) , there has been no systematic severing of diplomatic relations with Syria . 
Indeed , there has been no stoppage of flights to and from the country , or any other measures that could tilt the population of Damascus and Aleppo against the regime and bring the crisis to an end . 
This ambivalence can largely be explained by Western and Arab concern with the weakness and opacity of the Syrian opposition &apos;s political leadership . 
There is a dramatic discrepancy between the courage and tenacity of the demonstrators and fighters in Homs , Idlib , and Deraa , and the Syrian National Front , whose people and factions have failed to formulate a coherent political program , build an identity , and obtain name and face recognition . 
Western policymakers and those in the Gulf ask themselves what Syria would look like the day after Assad is toppled . 
The regime has been effective in exploiting that uncertainty by spreading the fear of an Egyptian scenario , in which the weakness of secular activists leads to a takeover by the Muslim Brothers and jihadis . 
In fact , it is difficult to separate cause from effect . 
Recognizing the opposition as the legitimate government of Syria , as was done in Libya , would give Assad &apos;s foes a boost , but , so far , they lack the gravitas that such a bold measure would require . 
The opposition must build itself as a credible and attractive alternative to the Assad regime , and the regime &apos;s international and regional critics must assist in that process . 
Assad &apos;s regime is doomed . 
It has no legitimacy , and it is bound to fall . 
The alternative is an effective opposition that enjoys unambiguous support by the key regional and international actors .
