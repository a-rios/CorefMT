Resilient India 
NEW DELHI - With the world &apos;s most developed economies reeling under the incubus of what is already being called the Great Recession , India at the beginning of the year took stock and issued a revised estimate for GDP growth in the 2008-2009 fiscal year . 
Its projection came out at a healthy 7.1 % . 
It is striking that even amid all the doom and gloom assailing world markets , there is no fear of a recession in India . 
Even the pessimists are speaking only of lower positive growth . 
This is quite a turnabout for an economy that for years had crept along at what was derisively called the &quot; Hindu rate of growth &quot; - around 3 % - while much of the rest of Asia shot ahead . 
For more than four decades after Independence in 1947 , India suffered from the economics of nationalism , which equated political independence with economic self-sufficiency and so relegated the country to bureaucratic protectionism and stagnation . 
But , since 1991 , India has liberalized its economy and profited from globalization . 
Its tech-savvy information-technology pioneers , software engineers , and call-center operators have made the country an economic success story . 
India has multiplied its per capita income levels many times over since 1950 , and has done so far faster in recent years than Britain or the United States did during and after the industrial revolution . 
In the last 15 years , India has pulled more people out of poverty than in the previous 45 - 10 million people a year on average in the last decade . 
The country has visibly prospered , and , despite population growth , per capita income has grown faster than ever before . 
The current financial crisis is unlikely to change the basic success story . 
India &apos;s financial system suffers from few of the creative and risky derivative instruments that caused such problems in the West . 
A tradition of conservative banking regulation and a tough-minded Governor of the Reserve Bank ( India &apos;s central bank ) ensured that Indian banks did not acquire the toxic debts flowing from sub-prime loans , credit-default swaps , and over-inflated housing prices that assailed Western banks . 
The negative effect of the US financial setbacks on Indian stock markets , therefore , made little sense , since they bore no relation to the real value of Indian companies . 
Instead , the decline in Indian stocks reflected foreign investors &quot; liquidity problems : they withdrew from holdings in India because they needed their money back home , not because it wasn &apos;t growing for them . 
Of course , economies that depend on foreign investment are bound to be hurt nowadays , because those investors have less capital to invest . 
But there are two reasons to be confident that India will weather the storm . 
First , India has considerable resources of its own to put towards growth , and has proven itself skilled at the art of channelling domestic savings into productive investments . 
Second , once things have begun to stabilize in the West , investors looking for a place to put their money will look anew at India , owing to the opportunities for growth and the sheer size of the market . 
That said , India has relied much less on foreign direct investment than China , and has even exported FDI to OECD countries . 
Despite being seen as a poster child for the benefits of globalization , India is not unduly dependent on global flows of trade and capital . 
India relies on external trade for less than 20 % of its GDP ; its large and robust internal market accounts for the rest . 
India &apos;s private sector is efficient and entrepreneurial , and its capital and management skills have proven able to control and manage assets in the sophisticated financial markets of the developed West . 
India clearly has the basic systems it needs to operate a twenty-first-century economy in an open and globalizing world . 
Obviously , the terrorist attacks of late November complicate this story . 
The terrorists attacked India &apos;s financial nerve-center and commercial capital , a city emblematic of the country &apos;s energetic thrust into the twenty-first century . 
They struck at symbols of the prosperity that have made the Indian model so attractive to the globalizing world , a magnet for investors and tourists alike . 
Indeed , by striking hotels favored by foreign businessmen and visitors , they undermined the confidence of those whom India needs to sustain its success story . 
Terror may add to the time India will need to recover from the economic crisis . 
But India is already bouncing back . 
The hotels assaulted and burned in November reopened their doors a month later . 
Investors are returning , and FDI inflows this fiscal year are set to exceed the $ 25 billion received in 2007-08 . 
At the end of February , Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh assured Parliament that &quot; India would emerge the least affected among the countries of the world from the current economic crisis . &quot; 
So , for those looking for signs of recovery from the global economic downturn , India remains the place to watch . 
According to the World Bank &apos;s annual assessment of Global Economic Prospects , India &apos;s economy could even triple in size in the next 15 to 20 years . 
A few more slumdogs may become millionaires by then .
