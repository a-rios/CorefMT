The Tacit-Knowledge Economy 
CAMBRIDGE - Almost all rich countries are rich because they exploit technological progress . 
They have moved the bulk of their labor force out of agriculture and into cities , where knowhow can be shared more easily . 
Their families have fewer children and educate them more intensively , thereby facilitating further technological progress . 
Poor countries need to go through a similar change in order to become rich : reduce farm employment , become more urban , have fewer children , and keep those children that they have in school longer . 
If they do , the doors to prosperity will open . 
And isn &apos;t that already happening ? 
Let us compare , for example , Brazil in 2010 with the United Kingdom in 1960 . 
Brazil in 2010 was 84.3 % urban ; its fertility rate was 1.8 births per woman ; its labor force had an average of 7.2 years of schooling ; and its university graduates accounted for 5.2 % of potential workers . 
These are better social indicators than the United Kingdom had in 1960 . 
At that time , the UK was 78.4 % urban ; its fertility rate was 2.7 ; its labor force had six years of schooling on average , and its university graduates accounted for less than 2 % of potential workers . 
Brazil is not a unique case : Colombia , Tunisia , Turkey , and Indonesia in 2010 compare favorably to Japan , France , the Netherlands , and Italy , respectively , in 1960 . 
Not only did these countries achieve better social indicators in these dimensions ; they also could benefit from the technological innovations of the past half-century : computers , cellphones , the Internet , Teflon , and so on . 
This should allow higher productivity than was feasible in 1960 . 
So today &apos;s emerging-market economies should be richer than today &apos;s advanced economies were back then , right ? 
Wrong - and by a substantial margin . 
Per capita GDP at constant prices was 140 % higher in Britain in 1960 than in Brazil in 2010 . 
It was 80 % higher in Japan back then than in Colombia today , 42 % higher in old France than in current Tunisia , 250 % higher in the old Netherlands than in current Turkey , and 470 % higher in old Italy than in current Indonesia . 
Why is it that today &apos;s smaller and more educated urbanized families in emerging-market economies are so much less productive than their counterparts were a half-century ago in today &apos;s rich countries ? 
Why can &apos;t today &apos;s emerging markets replicate levels of productivity that were achieved in countries with worse social indicators and much older technologies ? 
The key to this puzzle is tacit knowledge . 
To make stuff , you need to know how to make it , and this knowledge is , to a large extent , latent - not available in books , but stored in the brains of those who need to use it . 
Getting it there is really tough . 
Tacit knowledge is acquired mostly through learning by doing . 
That is how we train musicians , barbers , doctors , and scientists . 
Consider how long it takes an adult to learn to speak a language or a musician to master the violin . 
Moreover , tacit knowledge is vast and growing , so that only a miniscule fraction of it fits in anybody &apos;s head . 
But most products require much more knowledge than fits in anybody &apos;s head , so that making them requires teams of people with different pieces of knowledge , not unlike a symphonic orchestra . 
Getting more tacit knowledge is easier said than done , because economies can offer experience only on the basis of current jobs . 
How do people learn to do jobs that do not yet exist ? 
How do they create and mobilize coherent teams of people in new economic activities if the requisite tacit knowledge is missing ? 
Recent research at Harvard University &apos;s Center for International Development ( CID ) suggests that tacit knowledge flows through amazingly slow and narrow channels . 
The productivity of Nuevo Le√≥n , Mexico , is higher than in South Korea , but that of Guerrero , another Mexican state , resembles levels in Honduras . 
Moving knowledge across Mexican states has been difficult and slow . 
It is easier to move brains than it is to move tacit knowledge into brains , and not only in Mexico . 
For example , as the CID &apos;s Frank Neffke has shown , when new industries are launched in German and Swedish cities , it is mostly because entrepreneurs and firms from other cities move in , bringing with them skilled workers with relevant industry experience . 
They seldom hire locals . 
The recently deceased economist Steven Klepper argued that industries tend to cluster in particular cities simply because new firms are formed mainly by workers who leave other successful firms , taking the relevant tacit knowledge with them . 
Indeed , a large literature on knowledge spillovers points to their remarkably narrow geographic range . 
The exceptions often confirm the rule . 
The US would not have been able to build the first atomic bomb in just four years had Hitler not encouraged so many key scientists to leave Europe . 
The bottom line is that urbanization , schooling , and Internet access are woefully insufficient to transmit effectively the tacit knowledge required to be productive . 
That is why today &apos;s emerging markets are so much less productive than rich countries were in 1960 , even though the latter were less urban , had higher birth rates and less formal schooling , and used much older technologies . 
The policy implications are clear . 
Knowhow resides in brains , and emerging and developing countries should focus on attracting them , instead of erecting barriers to skilled immigration . 
They should tap into their diasporas , attract foreign direct investment in new areas , and acquire foreign firms if possible . 
Knowledge moves when people do .
