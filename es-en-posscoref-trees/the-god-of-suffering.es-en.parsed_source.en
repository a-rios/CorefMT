The God of Suffering ? 
PRINCETON - Do we live in a world that was created by a god who is all-powerful , all-knowing , and all good ? 
Christians think we do . 
Yet a powerful reason for doubting this confronts us every day : the world contains a vast amount of pain and suffering . 
If God is all-knowing , he knows how much suffering there is . 
If he is all-powerful , he could have created a world without so much of it - and he would have done so if he were all good . 
Christians usually respond that God bestowed on us the gift of free will , and hence is not responsible for the evil we do . 
But this reply fails to deal with the suffering of those who drown in floods , are burned alive in forest fires caused by lightning , or die of hunger or thirst during a drought . 
Christians sometimes attempt to explain this suffering by saying that all humans are sinners , and so deserve their fate , even if it is a horrible one . 
But infants and small children are just as likely to suffer and die in natural disasters as adults , and it seems impossible that they could deserve to suffer and die . 
Once again , some Christians say that we have all inherited the original sin committed by Eve , who defied God &apos;s decree against eating from the tree of knowledge . 
This is a triply repellant idea , for it implies that knowledge is bad , disobeying God &apos;s will is the greatest sin of all , and children inherit the sins of their ancestors , and may justly be punished for them . 
Even if we were to accept all this , the problem remains unresolved . 
For animals also suffer from floods , fires , and droughts , and , since they are not descended from Adam and Eve , they cannot have inherited original sin . 
In earlier times , when original sin was taken more seriously than it generally is today , the suffering of animals posed a particularly difficult problem for thoughtful Christians . 
The seventeenth-century French philosopher Ren√© Descartes solved it by the drastic expedient of denying that animals can suffer . 
Animals , he maintained , are merely ingenious mechanisms , and we should not take their cries and struggles as a sign of pain , any more than we take the sound of an alarm clock as a sign that it has consciousness . 
People who live with a dog or a cat are not likely to find that persuasive . 
Last month , at Biola University , a Christian college in southern California , I debated the existence of God with the conservative commentator Dinesh D &apos;Souza . 
In recent months , D &apos;Souza has made a point of debating prominent atheists , but he , too , struggled to find a convincing answer to the problem I outlined above . 
He first said that , because humans can live forever in heaven , the suffering of this world is less important than it would be if our life in this world were the only life we had . 
That still fails to explain why an all-powerful and all-good god would permit it . 
Relatively insignificant as this suffering may be from the perspective of eternity , the world would be better without it , or at least without most of it . 
( Some say that we need to have some suffering to appreciate what it is like to be happy . 
Maybe , but we surely don &apos;t need as much as we have . ) 
Next , D &apos;Souza argued that since God gave us life , we are not in a position to complain if our life is not perfect . 
He used the example of a child born with one limb missing . 
If life itself is a gift , he said , we are not wronged by being given less than we might want . 
In response I pointed out that we condemn mothers who cause harm to their babies by using alcohol or cocaine when pregnant . 
Yet since they have given life to their children , it seems that , on D &apos;Souza &apos;s view , there is nothing wrong with what they have done . 
Finally , D &apos;Souza fell back , as many Christians do when pressed , on the claim that we should not expect to understand God &apos;s reasons for creating the world as it is . 
It is as if an ant should try to understand our decisions , so puny is our intelligence in comparison with the infinite wisdom of God . 
( This is the answer given , in more poetic form , in The Book of Job . ) 
But once we abdicate our powers of reason in this way , we may as well believe anything at all . 
Moreover , the assertion that our intelligence is puny in comparison with God &apos;s presupposes just the point that is under debate - that there is a god who is all-knowing , all-powerful , and all good . 
The evidence of our own eyes makes it more plausible to believe that the world was not created by any god at all . 
If , however , we insist on believing in divine creation , we are forced to admit that the god who made the world cannot be all-powerful and all good . 
He must be either evil or a bungler .
