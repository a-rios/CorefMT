The Bush Black Hole 
In 2001 , President George W. Bush misled the American people . 
He said that a tax cut that was not designed to stimulate the economy would stimulate it , and the American people believed him . 
But it did not . 
He told Americans that the large surpluses that were among President Bill Clinton &apos;s legacies meant that the US could afford to cut taxes massively . 
Wrong again . 
He did not warn Americans how dubious such estimates can be . 
In 2003 President Bush misled the American people about the economy once more . 
Weeks after persuading Congress to pass another tax cut - in some ways even more inequitable than the first - his administration revealed how bad the fiscal position had become . 
The $ 230 billion surplus inherited from Clinton had turned into a $ 450 billion deficit . 
Now , after handing billions to rich Americans through tax cuts that almost exclusively benefit them , the Bush administration is passing the hat around , asking for contributions from other countries to help pay for the cost of the Iraq war . 
Even setting aside the other dubious aspects of Bush &apos;s Iraq policy , the conjunction of misguided giveaways to America &apos;s richest people with an international US begging bowl is hardly likely to evoke an outpouring of sympathy . 
Meanwhile , as all of this happens , the US trade deficit mounts . 
America , the world &apos;s richest country , evidently can &apos;t live within its means , borrowing more than a billion dollars a day . 
As the US thrashes around for someone to blame , it was inevitable that it would focus on China , with its large trade surplus , just as the twin fiscal and trade deficits of the Reagan era led to a focus on Japan two decades ago . 
But this is blame shifting , nothing more . 
America &apos;s fiscal and trade deficits are intimately linked . 
If a country saves less than it invests , it must borrow the difference from abroad , and foreign borrowing and trade deficits are two sides of the same coin . 
National saving has two components - private and public . 
With Reagan &apos;s irresponsible tax cuts , combined with America &apos;s paltry savings , the US had no choice but to borrow abroad . 
Now , under &quot; Bush II , &quot; America is repeating that folly . 
Matters may get even worse once investment is rekindled , unless private savings increase in a way America has not seen before . 
Some people abroad now tend to gloat at America &apos;s problems . 
For many , it is another reason to question America &apos;s ability to provide effective leadership . 
It took America a dozen years to work its way out of Reagan &apos;s fiscal mess . 
It may take just as long to clean up the mess Bush has created . 
But non-Americans &apos; Schadenfreude is misguided . 
Globalization means that mistakes in one country - especially in the world &apos;s largest economy - have powerful repercussions elsewhere . 
Three things are worth noting here . 
First , America &apos;s deficits are certain to sop up vast amounts of the world &apos;s pool of savings . 
But the world will recover eventually from its current slowdown , and that shortage of savings will become important . 
It will mean higher real interest rates , lower investment , and lower growth , all of which will be especially costly for developing countries . 
Second , America &apos;s huge trade deficit may be a major source of global instability . 
Will the world continue to finance this deficit willingly , to put its money into a country with such a demonstrated lack of competence in macroeconomic management ( to say nothing of the corporate , banking , and accounting scandals ) ? 
What returns will they demand ? 
What happens if global investors decide that they should change their portfolio mix , shifting slightly away from American assets ? 
A weak Europe and skittishness about emerging markets has been one of America &apos;s great strengths , but how long can the US rely on the weakness of others ? 
Finally , in searching for others to blame , America may once again enter an era of protectionism , as it did under Reagan . 
Bush may trumpet free markets , just as Reagan did . 
By one reckoning , close to a quarter of American imports were covered by some form of trade restrictions at the peak of Reagan protectionism ( including so called voluntary export restraints ) . 
Expect no less from Bush . 
Last year , Bush showed little reluctance in imposing steel tariffs - in clear violation of WTO rules . 
The good news is that , the world is beginning to see a rule of law in trade - a legal framework that , although not totally fair to developing countries , and in which economic power still counts for a great deal , may circumscribe America &apos;s ability to revert to the protectionism of the past . 
Europe has committed itself to fiscal responsibility - with almost too much zeal , failing to recognize that a well designed deficit in times of recession may yield high returns . 
The Bush administration has pushed forward tax cuts that lead to deficits while providing only a modest amount of stimulus . 
Equally worrying - both for America and the world - is the path on which it has embarked : deficits as far as the eye can see . 
The Bush administration &apos;s policies bode ill for America in the long run - and hence for the world .
