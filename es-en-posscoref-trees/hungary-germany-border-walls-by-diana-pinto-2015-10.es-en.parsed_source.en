A Clash of Western Civilizations 
PARIS - Images from the refugee crisis in Europe have juxtaposed smiling crowds in Vienna and Munich with grim , unwelcoming faces in Budapest . 
The result has been a surge of commentary about the &quot; two Europes &quot; - one welcoming , one forbidding . 
The truth is that disagreements over whether countries should take in refugees are hardly unique to Europe . 
The contrast on display is symptomatic of a deep rift within the Western world . 
The divide cuts across the United States , the European Union , and Israel - and , equally important , across Jewish and Christian communities . 
On one side are politicians like German Chancellor Angela Merkel , European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker , US President Barack Obama , former Israeli Welfare and Social Services Minister Isaac Herzog , and religious figures like Pope Francis . 
On the other are Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán , French nationalist politician Marine Le Pen , US Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump , Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu , the Cardinal of Hungary , Péter Erdő , and legions of other Eastern European clergy . 
Each of the camps shares a fundamental outlook on the role refugees play in society . 
The first group consists of those who consider democratic values to be more important than ethnic or national identities . 
In their view , anyone who abides by a country &apos;s laws can become a full-fledged citizen and contribute to the vitality of his or her adopted country . 
According to this view , inclusion of &quot; the other &quot; - people from different countries and cultures - does not destroy national identity ; it enriches it with new ideas and behaviors . 
Proponents of such cross-fertilization point to outsiders or their descendants who have attained high positions in their adopted countries : a Latino member of the US Supreme Court , German constitutional lawyers of Turkish origin , French prefects whose parents and grandparents arrived from North Africa , British lords and baronesses with roots in Africa and the Caribbean , and Italian writers of Indian descent . 
Accordingly , advocates of this worldview regard fences and walls as insults to humanity , proof that those who build and maintain them have no trust in their countries &quot; vibrancy and strength . 
Above all , they adhere to a universal discourse based on international law and ethical , moral , and religious principles . 
Christians and Jews in this camp stress that welcoming strangers and people in need lies at the very heart of their respective faiths . 
Taking in the needy is an ethical imperative , not a politically conditioned choice . 
Despite the fact that most refugees come from Arab lands known for their anti-Semitism and anti-Israel stance , Jewish intellectuals in this camp have been unanimous in welcoming them with open arms . 
Meanwhile , Pope Francis has been clear that Christian values include caring for refugees . 
On the other side of the divide are those who fear the other as a threat to national identity . 
Their gut-level response is to build fences and walls , as long and as tall as possible , whether on the border between Mexico and the US , on Israel &apos;s border with Egypt , or on Hungary &apos;s border with Serbia ( or even with fellow EU member Croatia ) . 
It is no coincidence that Hungarian and Bulgarian policymakers have turned to Israeli companies to seek technical advice on how to build their fences . 
Members of this camp do not believe that dynamic civil societies can integrate people of different origins within open democratic settings , or that their countries can benefit from welcoming them . 
The risk of a few bad apples ( Mexican drug dealers , Islamic terrorists , economic migrants , or those wishing to cash in on welfare systems ) outweighs any benefits that the vast majority of young and determined newcomers could bring . 
Nor does this camp believe in international conventions on the rights of asylum-seekers or the duty of signatory countries to take them in . 
Any appeal to human rights is derided as dangerous naiveté , as are references to moral or religious imperatives . 
Instead , the emphasis is on protecting the &quot; nation &quot; against foreign viruses . 
These views are promoted not only by politicians , but also by leading religious authorities , including the evangelical right in the US , Catholic prelates in Eastern Europe , and Israel &apos;s nationalist rabbis . 
This clash of Western civilizations could not be more important . 
Those who shut doors and build walls do not belong to the same family as those who welcome the needy in the name of higher values . 
The foundational principles of our democratic traditions are at stake - principles that are being weakened by the clash itself .
