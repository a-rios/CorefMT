Treaties Are A Friend \ u0027s Best Friend 
It is a cliche to say that September 11th changed the world , yet in some ways such talk is true . 
Russian / American relations have changed fundamentally , as Russia &apos;s quiet disappointment at America &apos;s decision to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ( ABM ) shows . 
The surprise is that it took Osama bin Laden &apos;s terrorists to reveal that no fundamental differences of ideology , economics , or politics now exist between the two countries . 
Russia experienced international terrorism long before others and thus sought joint international efforts against it long ago . 
Indeed , America did not lure Russia into the current war in Afghanistan ; instead , Russia is using the US to rout bin Laden &apos;s terrorists and the Taliban , who caused instability across Central Asia , Chechnya , and other Russian regions . 
So the new Russia / US relationship is not one of unilateral Russian concessions , as so many people here claim . 
It benefits both sides . 
With Al Qaeda and the Taliban routed , Russia &apos;s southern borders will be safer . 
Moreover , it is no exaggeration to say that Russian assistance - political , military , technical and intelligence - is equal in importance to the US as the support provided by its NATO allies altogether ( excluding Britain ) . 
None of this excites euphoria here . 
Many Russian analysts argue that once America &apos;s war against the Taliban is over , it will return to its unilateralist ways when help is no longer needed . 
This is a possibility . 
So , for today &apos;s altered Russia / US relations to flourish , two things are needed : 
$ an agreed , negotiated framework mapping the common interests of the two countries ; 
$ a mechanism for joint decision-making to protect these interests . 
A first practical step to be taken here is to establish a common definition of international terrorism . 
For example , are Basayev and Khattab , the Chechen rebel leaders , terrorists ? 
What about the Kosovo Liberation Army ? 
Agreement on this may be hard to find , but must be sought . 
We must pursue common efforts that do not demand an enemy to unite us . 
Joint efforts against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - offer an opportunity here . 
Greater economic cooperation , particularly over development of Russia and Central Asian oil , offer another . 
Regrettably , this still seems a dream because of differing interests over oil exploration and oil prices , as well as Russian debt repayment . 
The latter problem is vital . 
Debts burden Russia &apos;s economy mightily , which will become heavier as oil export revenues fall . 
Russia &apos;s foreign debts should be restructured and part of them - say , the Soviet-era debts - should be written off . 
A positive sign here is the recent decision by the foreign relations committee of the US Senate to write off a large part of Russia &apos;s American debts . 
Some within Russia view this decision as a reward for Russian calm after America unilaterally withdrew from the 1972 ABM Treaty . 
The truth is that the Senate committee reached this decision even before America announced its withdrawal . 
In any case , no legislation on this matter has been written and it remains unclear what conditions will be imposed . 
Nor is it clear that the US will convince Europe to follow suit . 
This matters because Russia &apos;s debts to Europe are greater than those owed to America . 
Much of the pre-September 11 agenda also remains unaddressed : arms control , NATO enlargement , and Russia &apos;s integration into the global market . 
America &apos;s unilateral withdrawal from the ABM Treaty will likely make finding agreement on all these issues harder . 
For example , the START II Treaty of 1993 requires both countries to cut their strategic nuclear arsenals in half from the 6,000 warheads permitted under the START I agreement . 
This is important because land-based nuclear missiles form the core of Russia &apos;s strategic forces . 
With START II in effect , Moscow would need to deploy large numbers of Topol-M missiles or build nuclear submarines equipped with ballistic missiles to match America . 
This need not happen if President Bush , as promised , cuts America &apos;s arsenal by two-thirds - to between 1,700 and 2,200 warheads - to match President Putin &apos;s planned cuts . 
But President Bush doesn &apos;t want to write this promise into a formal treaty - indeed , America &apos;s president seems allergic to formal treaties , whether they tackle pollution or nuclear weapons . 
But without a formal treaty , a new nuclear buildup may occur through carelessness , not superpower rivalry . 
Although President Putin won &apos;t make any sudden moves to destabilize Russia &apos;s newfound friendship with America , he must still defend his country &apos;s security . 
What he might choose to do is to follow America &apos;s example , so that , without officially renouncing the START treaties , Putin may quietly decide that he no longer considers himself bound by some of their provisions . 
Despite the ABM Treaty setback , the new Russia / US and Russia / NATO relationships must be institutionalized within treaties and new collaborative mechanisms . 
But America and its European allies sign formal treaties all the time and still remain friends . 
Thus American unwillingness to reach formal agreements raises suspicions here that it wants to use today &apos;s cooperation as camouflage for renewed unilateralism . 
In particular , it is feared that the Bush administration wants to escalate the anti-terrorist war by spreading hostilities to states America denounces as &quot; rogues . &quot; 
To do so would not only destroy the anti-terrorist coalition , but harden anti-American sentiments everywhere , including within Russia .
