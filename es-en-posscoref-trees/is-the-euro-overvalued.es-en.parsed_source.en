Is the Euro Overvalued ? 
CAMBRIDGE - An American traveler in Paris or Berlin is continually struck by how high prices are relative to those in the United States . 
A hotel room , a simple lunch , or a man &apos;s shirt all cost more at today &apos;s exchange rate than they would in New York or Chicago . 
To bring the cost of those goods and services down to the level in the US would require the euro to fall relative to the dollar by about 15 % , to around $ 1.10 . 
It is easy to jump from this arithmetic to the conclusion that the euro is overvalued , and that it is likely to continue the decline that began last December . 
But that conclusion would be wrong . 
Looking ahead , the euro is more likely to climb back to the $ 1.60 level that it reached in 2008 . 
There are three reasons why the traveler &apos;s impression that the euro is overvalued is mistaken . 
First , the prices that the traveler sees are generally increased by value-added tax ( VAT ) , which is universal in Europe but unknown in the US . Remove the VAT , which is typically 15 % or more , and the prices in Europe are similar to those in the US . 
Second , the goods and services that the traveler buys are just a small part of the array of goods and services that are traded internationally . 
The goods that Europe exports include machinery , chemicals , and a variety of other products that consumers do not buy directly . 
To judge whether their prices are &quot; too high &quot; at the existing exchange rate we have to look at the trade balance . 
Germany , Europe &apos;s largest exporter , has a very large trade surplus with the rest of the world . 
Because German exports are attractive to foreign buyers at the existing exchange rate , Germany in 2009 was the world &apos;s second largest exporter ( after China ) . 
Germany &apos;s exports exceeded its imports by nearly $ 200 billion in the past twelve months , a surplus equivalent to nearly 6 % of GDP . 
It is clear that Germany &apos;s net exports would remain high even if the euro appreciated substantially from its current level . 
The other eurozone countries are not as competitive as Germany at today &apos;s exchange rate . 
But the euro area as a whole nonetheless had a trade surplus of more than $ 30 billion over the past 12 months . 
And , with the euro down significantly relative to many other currencies over the past year , Europe &apos;s trade balance can increase further in the months ahead . 
To limit that increase , the euro must rise . 
This brings me to the third , and most fundamental , factor that is likely to cause the euro to strengthen substantially from its current level : global economic conditions require the eurozone to have a substantial trade and current-account deficit so that it becomes a large net importer of funds from the rest of the world . 
There are two reasons for this . 
First , the oil-producing countries and China will continue to export substantially more than they import . 
Their net foreign earnings must be invested in foreign countries &quot; stocks and bonds . 
While much of that investment will flow to the US , the surplus countries want to diversify their investment of these new net export earnings . 
The eurozone provides the only large capital market other than the US for such investments . 
But the eurozone can increase its inflow of foreign capital only if it has a current-account deficit , i.e. , if it increases its imports relative to its exports . 
And that will require a less competitive euro - higher relative to the dollar and other currencies . 
The flow of net export earnings from the oil producers and others into euros will push up the value of the euro and enable the transfer of funds to occur . 
Second , countries with large accumulations of dollar reserves will be shifting substantial fractions of those reserves into euros . 
Central banks in Asia and the Middle East have traditionally held their reserves in dollars . 
That made sense when they needed those reserves to be very liquid so that they could bridge temporary trade deficits . 
But those foreign-exchange balances have grown far beyond the level needed as emergency reserves . 
South Korea and Taiwan , for example , have foreign-exchange holdings of more than $ 250 billion each , and China &apos;s holdings total more than $ 2 trillion . 
These and other countries with very large foreign-exchange balances are beginning to diversify their holdings from dollars to euros , a process that will continue and that will inevitably cause the euro to rise relative to the dollar . 
So , while I will continue to complain about the prices that I face when I travel in Europe , I understand that the prices that matter for trade are more competitive than those that I see when I pay for my lunch . 
And I also know that the complementary pressures on Europe to import funds , and on surplus countries to diversify their currency holdings , will make European travel increasingly expensive in dollar terms .
