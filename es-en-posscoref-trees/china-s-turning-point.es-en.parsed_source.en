China &apos;s Turning Point 
NEW HAVEN - In early March , China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress will approve its 12th Five-Year Plan . 
In essence , it will change the character of China &apos;s economic model - moving from the export- and investment-led structure of the past 30 years toward a pattern of growth that is driven increasingly by Chinese consumers . 
This shift will have profound implications for China , the rest of Asia , and the broader global economy . 
Like the Fifth Five-Year Plan , which set the stage for the &quot; reforms and opening up &quot; of the late 1970 &quot; s , and the Ninth Five-Year Plan , which triggered the marketization of state-owned enterprises in the mid-1990 &quot; s , the upcoming Plan will force China to rethink the core value propositions of its economy . 
Premier Wen Jiabao laid the groundwork four years ago , when he first articulated the paradox of the &quot; Four &quot; Uns &quot; &quot; - an economy whose strength on the surface masked a structure that was increasingly &quot; unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and ultimately unsustainable . &quot; 
The Great Recession of 2008-2009 suggests that China can no longer afford to treat the Four Uns as theoretical conjecture . 
The post-crisis era is likely to be characterized by lasting aftershocks in the developed world - undermining the external demand upon which China has long relied . 
That leaves China &apos;s government with little choice other than to turn to internal demand and tackle the Four Uns head on . 
The 12th Five-Year Plan will do precisely that , focusing on three major pro-consumption initiatives . 
First , China will begin to wean itself from the manufacturing model that has underpinned export- and investment-led growth . 
While the manufacturing approach served China well for 30 years , its dependence on capital-intensive , labor-saving productivity enhancement makes it incapable of absorbing the country &apos;s massive labor surplus . 
Instead , under the new Plan , China will adopt a more labor-intensive services model . 
It will , one hopes , provide a detailed blueprint for the development of large-scale transactions-intensive industries such as wholesale and retail trade , domestic transport and supply-chain logistics , health care , and leisure and hospitality . 
Such a transition would provide China with much greater job-creating potential . 
With the employment content of a unit of Chinese output more than 35 % higher in services than in manufacturing and construction , China could actually hit its employment target with slower GDP growth . 
Moreover , services are far less resource-intensive than manufacturing - offering China the added benefits of a lighter , cleaner , and greener growth model . 
The new Plan &apos;s second pro-consumption initiative will seek to boost wages . 
The main focus will be the lagging wages of rural workers , whose per capita incomes are currently only 30 % of those in urban areas - precisely the opposite of China &apos;s aspirations for a more &quot; harmonious society . &quot; 
Among the reforms will be tax policies aimed at boosting rural purchasing power , measures to broaden rural land ownership , and technology-led programs to raise agricultural productivity . 
But the greatest leverage will undoubtedly come from policies that foster ongoing and rapid migration from the countryside to the cities . 
Since 2000 , annual rural-to-urban migration has been running consistently at 15-20 million people . 
For migration to continue at this pace , China will have to relax the long-entrenched strictures of its hukou , or household registration system , which limits labor-market flexibility by tethering workers and their benefits to their birthplace . 
Boosting employment via services , and lifting wages through enhanced support for rural workers , will go a long way toward raising Chinese personal income , now running at just 42 % of GDP - half that of the United States . 
But more than higher growth in income from labor will be needed to boost Chinese private consumption . 
Major efforts to shift from saving toward spending are also required . 
Specifically , that means social security , private pensions , and medical and unemployment insurance - plans that exist on paper but are woefully underfunded . 
For example , in 2009 , China &apos;s retirement-system assets - national social security , local government retirement benefit plans , and private sector pensions - totaled just RMB2.4 trillion ( $ 364 billion ) . 
Little wonder that families save out of fear of the future . 
China &apos;s new Plan must rectify this shortfall immediately . 
There will be far more to the 12th Five-Year Plan than these three pillars of pro-consumption policy . 
The Plan &apos;s focus on accelerated development of several strategic emerging industries - from biotech and alternative energy to new materials and next-generation information technology - is also noteworthy . 
But the emphasis on the Chinese consumer is likely to be the new Plan &apos;s defining feature - sufficient , in my opinion , to boost private consumption as a share of Chinese GDP from its current rock-bottom reading of around 36 % to somewhere in the 42-45 % range by 2015 . 
While still low by international standards , such an increase would nonetheless represent a critical step for China on the road to rebalancing . 
It would also be a huge boost for China &apos;s major trading partners - not just those in East Asia , but also growth-constrained European and US economies . 
Indeed , the 12th Five-Year Plan is likely to spark the greatest consumption story in modern history . 
Today &apos;s post-crisis world could hardly ask for more . 
But there is a catch : in shifting to a more consumption-led dynamic , China will reduce its surplus saving and have less left over to fund the ongoing saving deficits of countries like the US . 
The possibility of such an asymmetrical global rebalancing - with China taking the lead and the developed world dragging its feet - could be the key unintended consequence of China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan .
