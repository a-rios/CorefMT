The Return of Geopolitics to Europe 
BERLIN - With Russia &apos;s military invasion and annexation of Crimea , and the subsequent war in eastern Ukraine , President Vladimir Putin has made it abundantly clear that he has no intention of respecting the inviolability of borders and the primacy of international legal norms . 
It is time for Europeans to end their wishful thinking of a continental order determined by the rule of law . 
The world , unfortunately , isn &apos;t like that . 
It is much harder , and power rules . 
Russia &apos;s military intervention in Syria and Europe &apos;s refugee crisis underscore this point . 
Europe must recognize that if it doesn &apos;t take care of its geopolitical interests , sooner or later crises in its neighboring regions will arrive on its doorstep . 
Unlike the United States , Europe is not a continental island insulated by oceans . 
It is the western end of the giant Eurasian land mass . 
Eastern Europe , the Middle East , and North Africa are its direct neighbors , and this unstable neighborhood poses the greatest security risks to Europe in the twenty-first century . 
How should Europe deal with a Russia that is again pursuing great-power politics and making almost the same mistakes as the Soviet Union , which similarly relied on authoritarianism to try to reconcile the ambitions of a military superpower with the reality of a moderately developed and scarcely modernized economy ? 
Russia is Europe &apos;s neighbor , which means a modus vivendi is essential . 
At the same time , Russia &apos;s geopolitical ambitions makes it a continual threat to Europe &apos;s security . 
For that reason , a strong transatlantic relationship remains indispensable for Europe , as is the revival of its own deterrence capabilities . 
In the short term , the relationship with Russia will probably be dominated by efforts to end the war in eastern Ukraine , safeguard NATO territory in the east , and prevent the crisis from expanding toward the southwest and the Balkans . 
Beyond the current crisis , however , a much more fundamental strategic challenge is emerging . 
Europe is currently pursuing a policy vis-à-vis China - the emerging world power of the twenty-first century - that is based on an unrealistic and inconsistent mix of concern for human rights and for corporate profits . 
Here , too , Europe must demonstrate much greater awareness of the geopolitical risks and its own best interests . 
China , located at the eastern end of Eurasia , is planning to reopen the continental Silk Road through Central Asia and Russia in the direction of Europe . 
The pragmatic explanation for this gigantic strategic project ( with an investment volume of about $ 3 trillion ) is the need to develop western China , which has so far benefited little from the coastal regions &quot; economic success . 
In reality , however , the project is of paramount importance mostly in geopolitical terms : China , a land power , wants to challenge the potential economic and political influence of the US , a naval power , in Eurasia . 
In practical terms , China &apos;s Silk Road project will create a strategic alternative to Western transatlantic structures , with Russia either accepting a role as a permanent junior partner or risking serious conflict with China in Central Asia . 
But the choice of an Eastern or Western orientation is not in Europe &apos;s interest . 
On the contrary , such a choice would tear Europe apart both politically and economically . 
Europe , which is most closely tied to America in normative and economic terms , needs the transatlantic security guarantee . 
That is why , in dealing with Russia , the European Union should pursue a course of steadfast adherence to its principles and to NATO . 
Yet it simultaneously needs good relations with China and cannot block the Silk Road project . 
So , in dealing with China , Europe must be clear about its interests , which will require a high degree of unity . 
Meanwhile , the refugee crisis highlights the paramount importance for Europe of the Balkan Peninsula ( including Greece ) , which is the land bridge to the Near and Middle East . 
Turkey is even more important for European interests in this regard . 
European leaders gravely miscalculated at the start of Turkey &apos;s EU accession talks , believing that close ties would make the Middle East &apos;s conflicts Europe &apos;s problem . 
As current experience shows , in the absence of firm ties with Turkey , Europe &apos;s influence in the region and beyond - from the Black Sea to Central Asia - is practically zero . 
Domestic developments in Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the renewed militarization of the Kurdish question make a political approach anything but easy . 
But Europe has no alternatives ( and not only because of the refugees ) . 
This is all the more true given that Russia &apos;s emergence in Syria and the Kremlin &apos;s de facto alliance with Iran are once again pushing Turkey toward Europe and the West , which means that there is a real chance for a new start . 
Nonetheless , the potential for European influence in the Middle East remains low , and the region will remain dangerous in the long term . 
Indeed , Europe should avoid taking sides in the conflict between Shia and Sunnis or between Iran and Saudi Arabia . 
Instead , Europe &apos;s interests would be best served by pursuing a course of strategic ambiguity . 
That is not true , however , in the eastern Mediterranean . 
Indeed , the entire Mediterranean region , including the strategically located North African coast , plays a crucial role in Europe &apos;s security calculations . 
The choice is between a mare nostrum or a region of instability and insecurity . 
In the same vein , the EU &apos;s Africa policy must finally abandon post-colonial thought patterns in favor of the pursuit of Europe &apos;s own interests . 
The priorities must be the stabilization of North Africa , humanitarian aid , and long-term support for political , economic , and social progress . 
And closer ties should include opportunities for legal migration to Europe . 
The return of geopolitics means that the fundamental choice facing Europe in the twenty-first century will be between self-determination and external domination . 
How Europe addresses this question will determine not only its own fate , but also that of the West .
