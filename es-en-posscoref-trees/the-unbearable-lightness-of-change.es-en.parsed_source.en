The Unbearable Lightness of Change 
MADRID - Barack Obama &apos;s first year in office has been a sobering exercise in the limits of presidential power . 
It also carries lessons about how the resilient and impersonal forces of history can constrain any leader &apos;s drive for change . 
Obama &apos;s current &quot; winter of discontent &quot; genuinely reflects the mixed record of his first year . 
The Massachusetts electoral debacle only highlighted the growing rift between the president &apos;s agenda and popular sensibilities . 
Admittedly , Obama inherited a collapsing financial system , a declining world order , and the ever-present threat of global terrorism . 
In his titanic efforts to stem decline and reform America , Obama has shown vision and talent , but he also learned the hard way that , as Henry Kissinger put it in his memoirs , the pledges of new administrations are almost invariably like &quot; leaves on a turbulent sea . &quot; 
The impossible deadlines , the always ambiguous information the president is fed , and the complex choices that he must make are too frequently bound to clash with political constraints and the resistance to change of both allies and foes . 
The president &apos;s domestic agenda is bold and revolutionary , but it clashes frontally with the most fundamental tenets of America &apos;s liberal and individualistic ethos . 
His health-care reform plan , as the Massachusetts vote demonstrated , is perceived as a personal obsession and an entirely unnecessary distraction from much more urgent and vital concerns , such as the financial crisis and unemployment . 
Obama &apos;s priorities in foreign policy are definitely sound . 
But creating a structure of international relations that will make a more stable and enduring world order is not a task to be completed within one year . 
Nor is it at all certain that the sacrifices required of a country already stretched beyond the limits of its financial capabilities , together with the resistance of world powers , will allow this to be accomplished even in a single presidential term . 
Iraq is showing some positive signs of political and institutional recovery , but the omens for the future remain , in Obama &apos;s own words , &quot; messy . &quot; 
The disintegration of an already fragmented country , the return of civil war , and the shadow of Iran &apos;s power being cast over the Iraqi state are all plausible scenarios . 
A man of peace , Obama has become no less a war president than his predecessor . 
Having seen the harsh realities of the world as it really is , he has become the champion of the &quot; just war . &quot; 
In Afghanistan , he opted for a substantial military surge , but the notion of victory that would allow for a withdrawal of troops remains as foggy and uncertain as it was in the case of Iraq . 
The solution is ultimately political , not military . 
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was right to recognize that the Taliban are &quot; part of the political fabric &quot; of Afghanistan and thus &quot; need to participate in the country &apos;s government . &quot; 
But this might not be achieved without involving the major regional stakeholders , including Pakistan , China , and possibly Iran . 
The Obama administration &apos;s failure in re-launching the India-Pakistan peace talks over Kashmir is one of the gravest weaknesses of its &quot; AfPak &quot; strategy . 
If these two countries &quot; mutual hostility is not reined in , and a fundamentalist Afghanistan continues to provide the strategic depth through which Pakistan threatens its sworn Indian enemies , the current disaster might still breed defeat . 
Obama is right to boast of his success in enlisting China to join serious sanctions on North Korea , but he might be wrong to draw conclusions from this about Iran , a vital strategic partner for the Chinese . 
Likewise , America &apos;s &quot; reset button &quot; policy with Russia has certainly improved relations with the Kremlin , but it remains highly improbable that the Russians would endanger their privileged relations with Iran by joining an economic siege . 
Israel &quot; s fear that the failure of sanctions might bring the United States to accept coexistence with a nuclear-armed Iran in the way it did with the Soviet Union during the Cold War is not entirely unfounded . 
Obama &apos;s administration will not start a war with a third Muslim country while the two others continue to burn . 
Iran might eventually turn into the graveyard of Obama &apos;s dream of a world without nuclear weapons . 
George Bernard Shaw once observed that &quot; in the arts of peace Man is a bungler . &quot; 
Obama has just admitted that in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , a president can also be one . 
&quot; This is as intractable a problem as you get , &quot; he admitted after a wasted year of more error than trial . 
He naively ignored the harsh lessons of 20 years of abortive peacemaking , and insisted on sticking to the worn-out paradigm of direct negotiations between parties that , when left to their own devices , are bound to come to a deadlock . 
He was commendably humble to admit that he was wrong &quot; to have raised expectations so high . &quot; 
With no breakthrough in the Arab-Israeli conflict , Obama is left with the epicenter of the Middle East &apos;s maladies seriously undermining his entire strategy in the region . 
Yet he continues to be the greatest promise for a better world that this political generation can offer . 
And he still has time to vindicate Woodrow Wilson &apos;s belief that a &quot; president can be just as big a man as he chooses to be . &quot;
