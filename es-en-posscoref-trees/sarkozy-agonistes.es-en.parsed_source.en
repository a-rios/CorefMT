Sarkozy Agonistes 
&quot; Why do they hate us ? &quot; asked the Americans of the Islamic fundamentalists after 9 / 11 . 
&quot; Why do they not like me ? &quot; could be the question asked by Nicolas Sarkozy to the French after more than one year in power . 
Sarkozy is omnipresent both domestically and internationally . 
On July 13 , the leaders of more than 40 countries attended the first gathering of the &quot; Union for the Mediterranean &quot; in Paris . 
France is back in the world and in Europe . 
Domestically , an ambitious and difficult program of long-awaited reforms , which a majority of French citizens recognize are inevitable , has begun , with some early results in the field of labor law and education . 
Sarkozy &apos;s energy , willpower , and activism are nothing short of spectacular . 
And yet he is the least popular of the Fifth Republic &apos;s presidents , the one whose &quot; fall from grace &quot; with the French has been the most spectacular , rapid , and durable , to the point where political experts , and his friends and foes alike , wonder whether he can rebound . 
What went wrong ? 
&quot; I don &apos;t want a good General , I want a lucky one &quot; the French Emperor Napoleon I used to quip . 
By that standard , he would not have wanted Sarkozy . 
Having campaigned on a promise to restore and improve the French people &apos;s purchasing power , Sarkozy came to power , in May 2007 , just a few weeks before the sub-prime mortgage crisis erupted , and a few months before commodity prices exploded . 
He then assumed the European Union presidency just days after the resounding Irish &quot; No &quot; to the Lisbon Treaty reduced his role to an exercise in damage control at best . 
And , to make matters worse , the French soccer team , whose World Cup victory in 1998 gave his predecessor Jacques Chirac a short respite and a passing popularity boom , was humiliated in June &apos;s Euro championship . 
Yet the international context , with its unforeseen events , does not suffice to explain Sarkozy &apos;s unpopularity with the French . 
His problem stems from the combination of his essence and style , which adds up to a brutal lack of coherence . 
As economic crisis engulfs France and most of the world , the French are not reassured by their young and energetic president . 
Of course , there is an element of deeply unfair subjectivity in this perception . 
The president &apos;s physical appearance and his body language - if he was a Shakespeare character , he would probably be the traitor Iago in Othello - are part of the problem . 
His nervousness , his impulsiveness verging on vulgarity , is disconcerting even for the majority of French who voted for him . 
At home for example , the badly needed reform of the army has been accompanied by unnecessary malignity , as if a former interior minister imbued with a &quot; police culture &quot; was utterly incapable of understanding the &quot; army culture &quot; and its sense of honor . 
And his undeniable success in implementing his labor laws , exemplified by sparse street demonstrations , has been undermined by his irrepressible will to provocation , reflected in his gratuitous remark that &quot; today when there is a strike in France , no one notices it ! &quot; 
In his foreign policy , too , Sarkozy seems to combine the right intuitions with the wrong tactics - that is , when his entire strategy is not marred by the pursuit of contradictory objectives . 
France &apos;s policy toward China and the issue of the French and EU president &apos;s attendance at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics has represented a spectacular illustration of this lack of consistency . 
Sarkozy misjudged the balance of power between France and China , and France came out of that diplomatic episode badly bruised , with its president swallowing his human rights claims and bending to the diktat of realpolitik . 
In the same vein , there is a mismatch in Sarkozy &apos;s approach to Europe between the message and the messenger , between careful diplomacy needed to create a new consensus within the European Commission and with countries like Ireland , and president &apos;s rather authoritarian style . 
While Sarkozy &apos;s popularity remains low , a majority of the French want him to succeed , for he has four more years to go , and there is no alternative around the corner . 
The left remains in disarray , caught between its internal feuds and the rise of anti-capitalist extremism at its margins . 
For a president bent on implementing reforms , &quot; less can be more &quot; - less aggressiveness and less ego . 
But can a man act against his deepest nature ? 
The answer is probably no .
