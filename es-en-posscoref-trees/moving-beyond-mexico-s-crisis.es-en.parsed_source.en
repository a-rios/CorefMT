Moving Beyond Mexico &apos;s Crisis 
As the crisis over Mexico &apos;s disputed presidential election continues , questions are being raised not only about the conduct of the seemingly defeated candidate , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , but also about Mexico &apos;s presidential system . 
Is &quot; presidentialism &quot; as practiced in Mexico part of the problem ? 
Felipe Calderón of the center-right ruling party , the National Action Party ( PAN ) , is currently leading in the vote count , which must be confirmed by September . 
The next scheduled presidential election is not until 2012 , as are elections to the Senate , whose assent is needed for most legislation . 
Thus , Calderón and his party allies , with 41 % of the Senate seats , can never have a majority during his six-year term , and will also have a minority in the lower chamber , where the PAN holds only 43 % of the seats , until at least 2009 . 
If the street protests and legal challenges being mounted by López Obrador succeed , he will be in an even weaker position . 
López Obrador &apos;s center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) , together with allied small parties , holds 31 % of the Senate , and slightly less than one-third of the lower chamber . 
This means that for the first three years of a presidency brought to power amidst great popular demands , López Obrador would be able to enact little reform legislation . 
Moreover , he would not even be able to veto hostile legislation , because he would be the first president in Mexico &apos;s modern history not to have the one-third of seats in at least one chamber of the legislature necessary to sustain a presidential veto . 
So , whoever wins the election will have a partial minority in the legislature for his entire six-year term , and his legitimacy will be questioned by large segments of the electorate . 
In fact , since 1985 , fifteen Latin American presidents - most without legislative majorities - have not finished their term . 
No one would want Mexico to add to that total , or to witness the emergence of serious anti-democratic tendencies . 
Could the current standoff lead to such an outcome ? 
Mexico &apos;s transition to democracy between 1977-2000 was aided by a series of constitutional reforms that contributed to the emergence of the widely credible Federal Election Institute ( IFE ) . 
To date , neither the IFE nor any major international monitor , has alleged widespread electoral fraud . 
Moreover , each of the seven judges on Mexico &apos;s Federal Election Tribunal was individually approved by two-thirds majorities in the Senate , which included the PAN and the PRD . 
The Election Tribunal &apos;s decision to recount only 9 % of the ballot boxes cannot be reversed without more evidence of wrongdoing . 
If more evidence emerges , democratic prudence councils a complete recount . 
In the United States , the Supreme Court opted against a recount in Florida in 2000 , fueling widespread doubts about the legitimacy of the result . 
The stakes could be even higher in Mexico . 
Whatever the result of a recount , the winner would command enhanced legitimacy . 
In other words , the current crisis reflects a deeper , constitutional flaw . 
There are three classic models of democratic executives : pure parliamentarism , as in Britain ; semi-presidentialism , as in Charles De Gaulle &apos;s French Fifth Republic ; and pure presidentialism , as in the US . 
Interestingly , whereas Britain , France , and the US have not altered their models , many other successful democracies have introduced major changes in order to prevent dangerous problems with how the &quot; pure &quot; variant functions in the local context . 
In interwar Europe , parliamentarism in many countries was plagued by frequent votes of no confidence , bringing down governments and leaving states rudderless for long periods . 
After World War II , many countries with parliamentary systems reduced the likelihood of such instability by adopting the so-called &quot; constructive vote of no confidence . &quot; 
Before a no confidence vote can be held , agreement must be reached on a new government majority to take its place . 
These majorities are often constituted by complex coalitions of three or more parties that concur on a minimum program . 
Since the new government could also fall unless it retains a legislative majority , parliamentary systems have important &quot; coalition requiring &quot; and &quot; coalition sustaining &quot; incentives . 
The semi-presidential model has also produced variants . 
The most perilous outcome under this model is when neither the president nor the prime minister has a majority , which has never occurred in France , but has occurred in postcommunist countries such as Russia and Ukraine . 
In such circumstances , presidents have abused their powers and created &quot; super-presidential semi-presidential &quot; authoritarian regimes . 
To prevent this , Portugal , Poland , Lithuania , Slovenia , and recently Croatia and Ukraine reduced the constitutional powers of the directly elected president and increased the parliament &apos;s powers . 
Mexico &apos;s crisis is the ideal time to consider new variants of presidentialism . 
One alternative , called &quot; parliamentarized presidentialism , &quot; retains direct presidential elections , which many societies still demand . 
If a candidate emerges with at least 50.1 % of the popular vote , he or she is declared president . 
In these circumstances , the model functions as classic presidentialism ( even if it does not produce legislative majorities ) . 
If , however , no candidate receives 50.1 % of the popular vote , the elected legislature chooses the president , who thus would begin his term with a legislative majority . 
Unlike a directly elected president in classic presidentialism , such a legislatively produced president could be voted out by a &quot; constructive vote of no confidence , &quot; leaving incumbents subject to &quot; coalition requiring &quot; and &quot; coalition sustaining &quot; incentives . 
Of course , there is no guarantee that such a system would bring greater democratic stability to countries like Mexico , but it would provide many more mechanisms to resolve crises than are currently available . 
There is much more thinking to be done .
