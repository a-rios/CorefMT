Asia &apos;s Stifled Services 
MANILA - The eurozone crisis has dominated discussion among policymakers over the last few years , but the economic slowdown in Asia &apos;s two giants - the People &apos;s Republic of China ( PRC ) and India - has become a source of growing public concern as well . 
How worried should we be about an additional drag on the global economy ? 
After years of double-digit GDP growth , the PRC &apos;s economy is decelerating . 
At the Asian Development Bank , we predict that its growth will slow to 7.7 % this year , from 9.3 % in 2011 . 
The PRC &apos;s population is aging , real wages are rising , and growth is moderating toward more sustainable rates . 
India , too , has massive potential to grow fast and reap a demographic dividend , but it has been struggling with structural reform . 
We expect that India &apos;s expansion will slow to 5.6 % in 2012 , from 6.5 % last year . 
Weak external demand is partly responsible for the falloff in growth , but internal factors - namely , slowing investment and stagnating consumption - are also holding back economic expansion . 
Maintaining growth in the face of a global slowdown is a daunting task , and it requires rethinking the future of &quot; factory Asia . &quot; 
Asia &apos;s boom was driven largely by intraregional manufacturing linkages : intermediate goods and parts were sourced from within Asia for assembly into final goods exported to advanced economies . 
Where , then , should Asia look for another source of growth ? 
Upgrading the service sector - for example , business processing , tourism , and health care - could play a critical role in the region &apos;s future growth . 
Asia &apos;s service sector is already large , contributing significantly to growth and employment . 
Services accounted for nearly half of developing Asia &apos;s GDP in 2010 , two-thirds of India &apos;s growth from 2000 to 2010 , and 43 % of growth in the manufacturing-oriented PRC in the same period . 
In addition , service workers comprise more than one-third of total employment in developing Asia . 
If these countries follow the same path traveled by the advanced economies , agriculture &apos;s dominance will give way to industry , which in turn will be supplanted by services , further broadening their role . 
There is certainly room to grow : the share of industry in developing Asia &apos;s output surpassed the OECD average in 2010 ( 41 % vs. 24 % ) , but the share of services still lags by a wide margin ( 48 % vs. 75 % ) . 
Making Asia &apos;s service sector more dynamic is essential to future growth . 
Modern services - such as Internet connectivity technology , or financial , legal , and other professional business services - account for less than 10 % of Asia &apos;s service economy , well below the 20-25 % in advanced economies . 
While traditional service industries are able to provide jobs , they do not generate much income . 
Labor productivity is also quite low : For most economies in the region , service-sector productivity is less than 20 % of the OECD average . 
Even in South Korea , labor productivity in industry is 118 % of the OECD figure , but only 43 % of the average for services . 
A vibrant service sector could have broad economic benefits . 
Synergies between services and industry could improve overall productivity . 
For example , industrial design , marketing , and legal services could facilitate investment and development of new manufactured products . 
The service sector also tends to be more effective in job creation , particularly for women , thus supporting inclusive growth . 
Developing the service sector could also diversify the production base , thereby enhancing economic resilience and boosting growth momentum . 
Modern services are becoming increasingly tradable , providing new export opportunities . 
India and the Philippines , for example , have established themselves as world leaders in the export of outsourced business processes . 
Skills gaps and a lack of infrastructure are frequently cited as factors that hinder service-sector dynamism in Asia . 
Excessive regulation that protects incumbent firms and other vested interests undermines market competitiveness and limits prospects for improved productivity and efficiency . 
For example , legal markets are dominated by rich lawyers , schools are controlled by teachers &quot; unions , and the medical sector is influenced by powerful doctors , resulting in high business costs that also hamper industrial development . 
Many service firms in Asia are owned by the public sector , so governments have less incentive to deregulate services . 
Why , then , are they maintaining policies that protect the special-interest groups that dominate the service sector ? 
Many argue that regulations protect small domestic firms against undue competition from large foreign firms . 
In India , for example , there is fear that small mom-and-pop retailers will be crushed when Wal-Mart enters the market in the next few months . 
The government can , say , impose zoning regulations , help small retailers find specialized niches in the market , or provide skills training to displaced workers . 
The survival of artisanal retailers should not be used as an excuse to introduce or uphold business regulations that ultimately protect the incumbent rich . 
Asian policymakers must remember how they successfully developed their manufacturing sector - through competition . 
The same logic should be applied to services . 
Upgrading the service sector is low-hanging fruit for Asia , because tremendous investments are not required .
