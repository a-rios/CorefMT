Exorcising the Last Balkan Ghosts 
The next few weeks will see the resolution , one way or another , of the last territorial issues remaining in the Balkans , where the wars of the 1990 &quot; s ended with NATO interventions in Bosnia ( 1995 ) and Kosovo ( 1999 ) . 
Even with peace , major problems were left unresolved . 
Bosnia was divided between a Muslim-Croat federation and a Serb republic , with little authority vested in the central government and a large international military - and eventually civilian - presence needed to hold it together . 
Kosovo was left as a United Nations protectorate whose &quot; final status &quot; was uncertain . 
These unresolved issues are now returning : prompted by Serbia &apos;s government , Bosnia &apos;s Serb leadership is contemplating secession , even as its Muslim leadership tries to increase central control . 
And Kosovo &apos;s Albanian population is clamoring for independence , while Serbia tries to postpone a decision by blocking action in the Security Council . 
There is a real risk of renewed violence , though perhaps not on the scale of the 1990 &quot; s . 
If the current negotiations on Kosovo &apos;s status fail , Albanian extremists will seek to expel the more than 100,000 Serbs who live there . 
Similarly , any move by Bosnia &apos;s Serb Republic to secede could incite instability there . 
Serbia , which traded violent nationalism for nonviolent nationalism when Slobodan Milosevic was overthrown eight years ago , has done all it can to impede resolution of these issues , with strong support from Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia . 
Serbia wants as much independence as possible for the Serb Republic , while asserting its own sovereignty over Kosovo . 
Serbs governed only by Serbs on their own territory is still Serbia &apos;s goal . 
The United States and the European Union are committed to a different vision : democratic transition and integration of all of the Balkans into NATO and eventually the EU . 
But they have been reluctant to impose conditions on Serbia , for fear of bringing even more radical nationalists to power . 
The US allowed Serbia into NATO &apos;s Partnership for Peace , despite Serbia &apos;s refusal to extradite General Ratko Mladic , the Bosnian Serbs &quot; military leader in the 1990 &quot; s , to The Hague to face war crimes charges . 
The EU has negotiated and initialed ( but not yet signed ) a Stabilization and Association Agreement with Serbia , despite its recalcitrance in the Kosovo negotiations and meddling in Bosnia . 
But appeasement has failed . 
The US and the EU must use the strong hand that they still hold to ensure that their vision prevails , bringing lasting peace to a region that has repeatedly dragged great powers into conflict . 
This requires , above all , a stiff warning to Serbia that it can no longer prevent Bosnia and Kosovo from moving towards Europe . 
If for now a democratic Serbia prefers radical nationalism and alignment with Russia to membership in the EU and NATO , so be it . 
No vital US interests are at stake , and Serbia will soon recognize its mistake . 
The EU should be relieved not to admit such a Serbia . 
At the same time , the US and the EU , acting together , must get serious in Bosnia and Kosovo . 
In Bosnia , any further moves to undermine the essential compromise reached in the 1995 Dayton agreement should be met with the full powers of Bosnia &apos;s &quot; high representative , &quot; who has recently negotiated an agreement that will strengthen the country &apos;s fragile governing structure . 
Bosnia &apos;s leading Serb and Muslim politicians are playing with fire because they know the fire department is standing by . 
It is time to take away their matches . 
In Kosovo , now that a last-ditch round of negotiations has concluded with a report to the UN Secretary General , the US and the EU should agree to recognize Kosovo &apos;s independence , provided the Kosovars agree to implement the plan submitted by Finnish mediator Marti Ahtisaari . 
The Ahtisaari plan provides ample protection for Serbs and an international presence in Kosovo - which the US and the EU will need to deploy even without a new Security Council resolution - to ensure implementation . 
Ironically , Serbia &apos;s resistance to the Ahtisaari plan undermines protection for Kosovo &apos;s Serbs and increases the risk that they will be mistreated . 
American officials are fond of pointing out that the US has repeatedly intervened to protect Muslims from war and dictatorship . 
But this claim will be devalued if the so far successful international interventions in Bosnia or Kosovo end in tragedy . 
A satisfactory outcome in both places is within reach . 
To achieve it , the US and the EU must ensure that Serbia is blocked from making trouble , Kosovo becomes independent , and Bosnia stays united .
