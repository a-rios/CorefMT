Brazil &apos;s Institutional Limbo 
SÃO PAULO - International investors are watching closely as Brazilians prepare to vote in the second round of the presidential election on October 26 . 
Their vote will not only decide who will be the country &apos;s next president ; it may also determine the future of the Central Bank of Brazil ( BCB ) , and therefore the country &apos;s macroeconomic trajectory . 
While the incumbent president , Dilma Rousseff , supports the BCB &apos;s existing institutional framework , her opponents contend that monetary policy is plagued by political interference , which would best be addressed by giving the BCB greater autonomy . 
If Brazil is to sustain strong and stable economic growth , the central bank will need an overhaul . 
Monetary policy has long played an important role in Brazilian politics . 
During the democratization process of the 1980s and 1990s , successive governments tried to tame hyperinflation , which reached 2,477 % in 1993 . 
The introduction of the &quot; Real plan , &quot; launched in 1994 , managed to suppress annual price growth to an &quot; acceptable &quot; 22 % by the following year . 
Riding on the plan &apos;s success , its architect , Fernando Henrique Cardoso , a former economy minister , was twice elected President ( in 1994 and 1998 ) , underscoring voter concern about price stability . 
Today , as central bankers in developed countries fret about the threat of deflation , Brazilian politicians are once again forced to respond to widespread fears about slowing growth and a return to high inflation . 
Unfortunately , the presidential candidates &quot; plans for the BCB fall short of what is required . 
Historically , Rousseff &apos;s Workers &quot; Party ( PT ) has resisted giving the bank formal autonomy , and she has played a distinctly populist card during the campaign , arguing that BCB autonomy would hand too much control to private bankers . 
Marina Silva , the Socialist Party &apos;s candidate , demanded formal bank independence - an argument subsequently adopted by the Social Democratic Party ( PSDB ) candidate , Aécio Neves , who now faces Rousseff in the election run-off . 
Like Cardoso , Neves is committed to inflation targeting , creating a primary surplus , and maintaining a floating exchange rate . 
While such policies may promote price stability , his proposal neglects the two most important issues for the BCB : legal autonomy and institutional reforms that ensure accountability to citizens . 
A legal commitment to BCB autonomy would contribute to currency confidence in a way that informal autonomy cannot . 
Legal structures have a direct impact on inflation expectations , because law can provide institutional protection to public goods , such as price and financial stability . 
Properly designed and executed , institutional reform could also increase BCB accountability to society at large while guarding against undue political influence and lobbying by the big banks . 
The BCB is ripe for reform . 
It is a 50-year-old technocratic bureaucracy established under a military dictatorship , with few legal instruments for political and social accountability . 
Institutional reform must therefore move beyond the BCB &apos;s inadequate price-stability target , which is set according to a narrow inflation index that fails to reflect the experiences of ordinary Brazilian consumers . 
For example , the reported 2013 inflation rate was 5.9 % ( compared to a 4.5 % target ) ; but prices for food , a major share of most households &quot; budgets , rose by 8.4 % , hitting the poor especially hard . 
The Rousseff administration has kept the reported inflation rate artificially low by suppressing prices for state-run services . 
Price stability should be accompanied by other targets , especially financial stability , but also , possibly , employment . 
Rousseff thwarted Congress &apos;s attempts to introduce such targets in 2011 , and they would , of course , need to be carefully designed to avoid past mistakes . 
There is also scope for institutional reform to promote greater financial stability . 
The 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath highlighted the consequences of the BCB &apos;s outdated institutional design . 
The Bank had insufficient legal backing for action needed to stabilize the financial system . 
Lula claimed that this ad hoc approach gave Brazil a degree of flexibility lacking in other countries ; but it was not cost-free , as he claimed , and the results did not endure . 
Rapid expansion of private debt raises other , larger concerns . 
Other central banks have recognized the need for new instruments to ensure financial stability ; so must the BCB . 
Institutional clarity on the BCB &apos;s mandate for financial stability and the instruments at its disposal could help Brazil avoid future crises - or at least weather them more effectively . 
Brazil &apos;s presidential election appears to offer two unsatisfying choices : a continuation of the status quo , with the BCB subject to political influence , under Rousseff ; or an informally autonomous BCB with an outdated institutional apparatus , under Neves . 
Only Silva &apos;s initial proposal included calls for institutional reform of monetary policy and financial regulation ; and it is far from certain that her endorsement of Neves in the run-off will sway his view should he win .
