The Past is Never Past 
PARIS - A nation &apos;s relationship with its past is crucial to its present and its future , to its ability to &quot; move on &quot; with its life , or to learn from its past errors , not to repeat them . 
There is the past that &quot; isn &apos;t dead and buried . In fact , it is not even past , &quot; in William Faulkner &apos;s famous phrase . Such a past obsessively blocks any possible evolution towards a necessary reconciliation with oneself and a former or current foe . 
Such a past is painfully visible today , for example , in the Balkans , a world largely paralyzed by a painful fixation on the conflicts that tore the region apart in the 1990 &quot; s . 
An absolute inability to consider the point of view of the other and to go beyond a sense of collective martyrdom still lingers , unequally to be fair , over the entire region . 
What the Balkans needs nowadays are not historians or political scientists , but psychoanalysts who can help them transcend their past for the sake of the present and the future . 
It is to be hoped that the promised entrance into the European Union will constitute the best &quot; psychoanalytical cure . &quot; 
In contrast to this paranoid version of the past is a past that is buried under silence and propaganda ; a past that is simply not dealt with and remains like a secret wound that can become reopened at any moment . 
Of course , non-treatment of the past is not the exclusive privilege of non-democratic regimes . 
More than thirty years after the disappearance of the long dictatorship of Francisco Franco , Spain finds itself confronted by the shadows of a past it has deliberately chosen not to confront . 
That supposedly buried past was always there , poised to erupt with a vengeance once the economic miracle slowed or stopped . 
China , which has just been celebrating with a martial pomp the sixtieth anniversary of Mao &apos;s founding of the &quot; People &apos;s Republic &quot; constitutes one of the most interesting cases of a nation evincing &quot; short sightedness &quot; towards its past . 
China has a lot to show for in its recent history . 
Just consider the massive access to education of its huge rural population in contrast with its &quot; democratic rival &quot; India . So China &apos;s pride nowadays is legitimate . 
In sixty years a weak and divided country , one torn apart by wars internal and external , is about to become the second most powerful economy in the world . 
China &apos;s insolent prosperity , even if it is far from being distributed equally , China &apos;s relative political stability , even if the regime &apos;s opening remains strictly limited , are undeniable and deserving of respect . 
But the success of a country that has so mobilized its energies as to transform past humiliations into massive national pride is not accompanied amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; and this is an understatement amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; by a responsible opening into its past . 
From 1957 to 1976 , from the beginning of Mao &apos;s &quot; Great Leap Forward &quot; which led to a mass famine that killed tens of millions of people , to the end of the &quot; Cultural Revolution &quot; which left Chinese society divided and traumatized due to its wanton cruelty and the destruction of cultural goods , China endured two hideous decades . 
But how can China become capable of implementing the &quot; rule of law &quot; which it so badly needs , let us not even speak of democracy , if it continues to systematically lie to its people about the recent past ? 
To refuse to deal with a painful past is to risk reproducing it . 
Such a choice can encourage the most dangerous nationalist tendencies within a society that does not know , especially young people , what hides behind the silence and official lies . 
My Chinese students when I taught at Harvard University last year ignored almost completely their recent history . 
They reacted with a somewhat &quot; defiant nationalism &quot; to critical observations . 
They were going &quot; to check &quot; the &quot; accuracy &quot; of historical remarks that did not fit with the history they had been taught at school . 
How could I be so critical of Mao ? 
It demonstrated my western bias against a rising Asian giant . 
Between the two extreme of the Balkans and China , the relationship between &quot; Memory &quot; and &quot; History &quot; knows so many shades of grey . 
It took France nearly fifty years to openly confront its Vichy past and to recognize that the French state had been guilty of collaboration with the Nazis . 
The country &apos;s colonial past still remains a painful issue that is yet far from being confronted in a dispassionate , objective manner . 
It is as if truth and justice are seen as potential obstacles to peace , stability and progress . 
But there is a major difference between the search for historical truth , which is an absolute must for a society at large and the search for the settling of scores and the punishment of those found and declared guilty . 
One must know the past , not to risk repeating it , but also in order to transcend it . 
But between a history that paralyzes a nation &apos;s ability to &quot; move on &quot; collectively and an absolute unwillingness to face the past , which can lead to criticism of the present , there is ample room for maneuver . Healthy nations use that room to bury the pain of the past , if not the past itself .
