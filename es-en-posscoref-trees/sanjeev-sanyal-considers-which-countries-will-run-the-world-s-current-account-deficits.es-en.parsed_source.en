Who Will Run the World &apos;s Deficits ? 
SINGAPORE - These days everyone seems to want to run a current-account surplus . 
China has long run large surpluses . 
The eurozone is now running even larger ones , with swings in southern Europe augmenting Germany &apos;s longstanding surpluses . 
Indeed , countries from Singapore to Russia are running large surpluses . 
Meanwhile , America &apos;s external deficit - which for decades has helped to sustain surpluses elsewhere - is now smaller than it was before 2008 , with many economists arguing that it should never revert to its previous levels ( they argue that the shale-gas boom makes this unlikely , anyway ) . 
Financial markets have also made clear that the ability of other major deficit countries , like Brazil and India , to absorb capital flows is reaching its limit . 
Since the world is a closed system , this raises the question : Who will run the world &apos;s deficits ? 
Mainstream economists believe that the global economy should function as a balanced mechanical arrangement in which external surpluses and deficits are smoothed out over time . 
One part of the world runs large deficits for a prolonged period , creating demand ; another part of the world runs surpluses , financing its counterparts &quot; deficits . 
This was true of Roman-Indian trade in the first and second centuries , and of the age of European exploration in the sixteenth century . 
It was also true of the two Bretton Woods arrangements , in which the US ran the necessary deficits . 
Admittedly , imbalanced systems create distortions . 
The Romans had to debase their coins , owing to the continuous loss of gold to India . 
The Spanish empire flooded the world with silver coins as it paid for its many wars . 
Bretton Woods I collapsed in 1971 , when the dollar &apos;s peg to gold became untenable , and Bretton Woods II ended in 2008 , owing to the misallocation of capital . 
The only significant period of &quot; balanced &quot; economic expansion was in the early nineteenth century . 
The British East India Company deliberately imposed a triangular trade arrangement whereby Britain sold manufactured goods to India in order to buy opium , which it subsequently sold in China to finance the purchase of tea and other products . 
In other words , balanced global economic growth required war , colonization , and large-scale drug trafficking . 
So , what symbiotic imbalance will underpin the next round of global economic growth ? 
Given that the current account is the difference between a country &apos;s saving and investment rates , both of which are heavily influenced by demographics , we need to consider rapid changes in population dynamics . 
China currently saves and invests half of its GDP , but , as its workforce shrinks in the coming years , its investment rate is likely to fall sharply . 
However , aging will keep the saving rate from falling at the same pace . 
This differential will generate large external surpluses that will transform China from the &quot; world &apos;s factory &quot; into the &quot; world &apos;s investor . &quot; 
It would be convenient if global demographics were distributed in such a way that aging countries could run surpluses just when younger countries needed the capital . 
In reality , many major economies will be trying to save for retirement at the same time . 
Moreover , the younger countries are typically emerging markets , which have neither the scale nor the capacity to absorb the world &apos;s excess savings efficiently . 
The US is the main exception : it has both the required scale and the youngest population of any major developed country . 
Given this , it will once again fall to the US to run the world &apos;s largest external deficit , in what could be dubbed Bretton Woods III . 
It may seem appalling to expect such a highly indebted country to continue to run deficits ; but the world is willing to finance the US at negative real interest rates . 
Indeed , the main international concern has been US policymakers &quot; reluctance to raise the government &apos;s debt ceiling ! 
If the US is unable or unwilling to run the required deficits , the global economy will flounder in a savings glut of low demand and cheap capital until another alternative emerges . 
Or perhaps the low cost of international capital will entice the US to absorb some of the world &apos;s excess savings , triggering a new period of global expansion . 
While a Bretton Woods III arrangement would inevitably generate its own distortions , it could last for years if the capital is invested sensibly . 
The prospect of its eventual demise is not a good reason to wait for some theoretical ideal of global balance to materialize . 
If history is any indication , we will be waiting for a long time .
