Europe needs to make up its mind 
The celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome this month come at an opportune moment . 
For now is the time for the European Union to call an end to its self-imposed &quot; reflection period &quot; following the rejection of the European Constitution by the French and the Dutch , and make up its mind about the future . 
The reflection period has been mostly devoid of actual reflection , and Europe &apos;s leaders have failed to offer Europe &apos;s citizens any new , fundamental vision . 
So how should a &quot; refounding &quot; ( Neubegr√ºndung ) of Europe - as called for by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in her first parliamentary statement on European policy - be accomplished ? 
In theory , there are three competing , fundamentally different visions of the EU &apos;s future . 
Some still take the form of a &quot; state of nation states . &quot; 
These thinkers - often imprecisely called &quot; Federalists &quot; - refer to the Constitution as a necessary step towards a European federation . 
Such a federal state can be justified by claiming that the moral substance of traditional nation states has been deeply compromised by past belligerence , or as a practical preventive measure to keep the potential of new nationalist passions in check . 
Moreover , the British political scientist Glyn Morgan has argued that a robust concept of pan-European security also requires a pan-European state , and that it is irresponsible on the part of Europe &apos;s elites to maintain a permanent position of strategic dependency on the United States . 
Related to this is the idea that only a strong EU can save the &quot; European social model . &quot; 
But the last few years have made clear the absence of majority support for a European federation by the states that make up Europe , a point underscored by the debate surrounding the failed Constitutional Treaty . 
In fact , many of the &quot; federalist &quot; arguments look dubious : in particular , there is no single European social model . 
The differences for instance between the Scandinavian countries , the Mediterranean countries , and the &quot; liberal Atlantic countries &quot; like Ireland and the UK are sometimes more pronounced than those between Europe as a whole and the US . 
In recent years , an alternative view of the EU that can be described as &quot; supra-national multiculturalism &quot; has taken root . 
This view entails a Union whose main function is to allow - and to maintain - diversity and difference . 
Instead of traditional homogeneous states , this Europe seeks to be a &quot; Community of Difference , &quot; a kind of &quot; People of Others , &quot; to borrow a phrase from the jurist Joseph Weiler . 
Tolerance becomes the cardinal European virtue in this vision , and the EU &apos;s character as an entity with federal law but without federal statehood is viewed as a strength , not a weakness . 
The prophets of supra-national multiculturalism thus reject a federal democracy . 
What is feasible is , they believe , at best a so-called &quot; demoi-cracy &quot;  -  that is , the rule not of one people or &quot; demos , &quot; but of many peoples or &quot; demoi &quot; who deliberately assure and seek to maintain their diversity . 
Elements of this vision sound attractive . 
It is questionable , though , how credible European heads of government are who promote such pan-European multiculturalism and at the same time emphatically denounce alleged &quot; multiculturalist &quot; illusions at home - as has by now become standard political rhetoric in almost all countries . 
The third vision is essentially no vision at all , but a justification of the Brussels bureaucracy as it currently exists . 
From this technocratic perspective , Brussels today maintains functions that even within nation states are often delegated to institutions that are not democratically elected . 
Central banks are the classic example . 
Those policy areas that citizens consider the most significant - in particular welfare and education - remain under the direction of member states . 
Consequently Brussels is no government to be , but a regulatory authority - and this often to the benefit of European consumers . 
This authority , the technocrats claim , in turn is part of a system of national and supra-national checks and balances which , while not resembling a national democracy , would reliably prevent despotism from taking root in Brussels . 
None of these three visions entirely misses the EU &apos;s current reality or its future possibilities . 
The federation has become a distant prospect , but still receives homage in politicians &quot; speeches , as if a different end result was inconceivable . 
The demoi-crats win support because their vision tends to reinforce the status quo and leaves nearly all options open . 
The technocrats in turn see their position confirmed with every passing day that the alleged crisis of legitimacy fails to appear . 
But is there any kind of pan-European consensus on where Europe should go next , whether federal state , demoi-cracy or status quo ? 
If the answer is no , adhering to a pragmatic approach to the Union as a kind of continuously expanding &quot; Commonwealth &quot; is the most honest alternative to any high-minded visions . 
The classic argument that the EU , like a bicycle , must always keep moving forward to avoid falling over , is simply not true : the reflection period may be frustrating for federalists , but it also proves that , even at a standstill , the EU continues . 
The Brussels elites are not likely to admit this fact without further ado : their rhetoric still oscillates between doom-and-gloom pessimism and a kind of pro-European PR that is concerned only with how best to &quot; sell &quot; the Union to Europe &apos;s citizens . 
But PR won &apos;t work unless there is a vision that ultimately sells itself .
