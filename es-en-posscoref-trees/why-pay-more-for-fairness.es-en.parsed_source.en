Why Pay More for Fairness ? 
Marks &amp; Spencer , a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout Britain , recently announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea , totaling 38 lines , to Fairtrade , a marketing symbol of &quot; ethical production . &quot; 
The chain already sells only Fairtrade tea and coffee in its 200 Caf√© Revive coffee shops . 
It is also boosting its purchases of shirts and other goods made with Fairtrade cotton . 
The announcement came during &quot; Fairtrade Fortnight , &quot; a two-week promotion of Fairtrade products that included speaking tours by farmers from developing countries , telling Britons how Fairtrade has assisted their communities . 
The movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the United States as well , as consumers increasingly turn to organic , locally produced foods , and eggs from hens not kept in cages . 
In the UK , a survey has found that half of those shown the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for Third World farmers . 
There is no comparable US research , but related data , and discussions with my own students , suggests that the figure would be much lower . 
Traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage . 
For example , the minimum price for coffee is $ 1.26 per pound , no matter how low the market price may fall . 
If the market price rises above that figure , the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher . 
Small farmers , for their part , are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation . 
Plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages , comply with health , safety , and environmental standards , allow unions or other forms of workers &quot; associations , provide good housing if workers are not living at home , and do not use child labor or forced labor . 
Not every one approves of Fairtrade . 
Brink Lindsey , director of the pro-market Cato Institute &apos;s Center for Trade Policy Studies , believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a &quot; well-meaning dead end . &quot; 
With some justification , he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profiteering of multinationals , but big increases in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam , combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply . 
In Lindsey &apos;s view , if we want to assist coffee growers , we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops - and here he rightly points to rich nations &quot; trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled - or to move into higher-value products , like specialty coffees , that bring higher prices . 
What is curious about Lindsey &apos;s argument , however , is that the Fairtrade coffee campaign can be seen as doing just what he recommends - encouraging coffee farmers to produce a specialty coffee that brings a higher price . 
Pro-market economists don &apos;t object to corporations that blatantly use snob appeal to promote their products . 
If people want to pay $ 48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee because that &apos;s what James Bond prefers , economists don &apos;t object that the market is being distorted . 
So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $ 12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals , under shade trees that help birds to survive , by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children ? 
Economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children , you can pay $ 10 for a pound of non-Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $ 2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children . 
That &apos;s a possible strategy , but there are advantages to Fairtrade . 
The growers know that they have to provide a product that consumers like , both for its taste and for the way it is grown . 
If their product sells well , they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world . 
From the growers &quot; perspective , receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce . 
Paying more for a Fairtrade label is no more &quot; anti-market &quot; than paying more for a Gucci label , and it reflects better ethical priorities . 
Fairtrade is not a government subsidy . 
Its success depends on market demand , not political lobbying . 
Fortunately , in Europe , that market demand is growing rapidly . 
One hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world , and wherever people can make choices about their discretionary spending .
