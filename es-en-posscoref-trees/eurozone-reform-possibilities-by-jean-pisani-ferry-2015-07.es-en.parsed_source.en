Can the Euro Be Repaired ? 
PARIS - When Wolfgang Schäuble , Germany &apos;s finance minister , recently tabled the option of a Greek exit from the euro , he wanted to signal that no member could abstain from the monetary union &apos;s strict disciplines . 
In fact , his initiative triggered a much broader discussion of the principles underpinning the euro , its governance , and the very rationale for its existence . 
Only a fortnight before Schäuble &apos;s proposal , Europe &apos;s leaders had barely paid attention to a report on the euro &apos;s future prepared by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his colleagues from the other European Union institutions . 
Meanwhile , citizens wonder why they share this currency , whether it makes sense , and if agreement can be reached on its future . 
For currencies , as for countries , founding myths matter . 
The conventional wisdom is that the euro was the political price Germany paid for French acquiescence to its reunification . 
In fact , German reunification only provided the final impetus for a project conceived in the 1980s to resolve a longstanding dilemma . 
European governments were both strongly averse to floating exchange rates , which they assumed would be incompatible with a single market , and unwilling to perpetuate a Bundesbank-dominated monetary regime . 
A truly European currency built on German principles appeared to be the best way forward . 
In retrospect , German reunification was more a curse than a blessing . 
When exchange rates were locked in 1999 , Germany &apos;s was overvalued , and its economy was struggling ; 
During the ensuing decade , imbalances slowly grew between a resurgent Germany and countries where low interest rates had triggered credit booms . 
No one can say how Europe would have evolved without the euro . 
Would the fixed-exchange-rate system have endured or collapsed ? 
Would the Deutschemark have been overvalued ? 
Would states have reintroduced trade barriers , ending the single market ? 
Would a real-estate bubble have developed in Spain ? 
Would governments have reformed more or less ? 
Establishing a counterfactual baseline against which the euro &apos;s impact could be assessed is impossible . 
Over the last 15 years , the eurozone &apos;s economic performance has been disappointing , and its policy system must answer for this . 
What really matters is whether a common European currency still makes sense for the future . 
This question is often evaded , because the cost of exiting is deemed too high to consider it ( and could be higher still if the break-up takes place in a crisis and sharpens reciprocal acrimony among participating countries ) . 
Moreover , pulling the plug on the euro could unleash the dark forces of nationalism and protectionism . 
It is the logical equivalent of advising a couple to remain married because divorce is too expensive . 
So does the euro still make sense ? 
It was expected to deliver three economic benefits . 
Monetary union , it was assumed , would foster economic integration , bolstering Europe &apos;s long-term growth . 
Instead , intra-eurozone trade and investment have increased only modestly , and growth potential has actually weakened . 
This is partly because national governments , rather than building on currency unification to turn the eurozone into an economic powerhouse , tried to hang onto their remaining power . 
This was perhaps logical politically , but it made no economic sense : Europe &apos;s huge domestic market is one of its main assets , and opportunities to strengthen it should not be squandered . 
Second , it was hoped that the euro would become a major international currency ( particularly given how few countries are equipped with the necessary legal , market , and policy institutions ) . 
With international use of the euro behind only the US dollar , this achievement can help Europe to continue shaping the global economic order , rather than sliding into irrelevance . 
Third , it was ( somewhat naively ) believed that the institutions underpinning the euro would improve the overall quality of economic policy , as though Europe-wide policies would automatically be better than national ones . 
The acid test came in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis : because it overestimated the fiscal dimension of the crisis and underestimated its financial dimension , the eurozone performed worse than the United States and the United Kingdom . 
If the euro is to create prosperity , further reforms of the policy system are therefore needed . But an agenda can be designed and implemented only if there is a broad consensus on the nature of the problem . 
Richard Cooper of Harvard University once observed that in the early days of international public health cooperation , the fight against global diseases was hampered by countries &quot; adherence to different models of contagion . 
They all favored joint action , but they could not agree on a plan , because they disagreed on how epidemics crossed borders . 
That is the problem the eurozone faces today . 
Fortunately , it is not unsolvable , as significant reforms like the creation of the European Stability Mechanism and the launch of banking union show . 
Disagreements also did not prevent the ECB from acting boldly , which illustrates that the governance of institutions does matter . 
Europe cannot afford to procrastinate and pretend . 
Either the eurozone &apos;s members find agreement on an agenda of governance and political reforms that will turn the currency union into an engine of prosperity , or they will stumble repeatedly from dispute to crisis , until citizens lose patience or markets lose trust . 
Clarity is a prerequisite of serious discussion and ambitious reform . 
Each of the major participants now has an obligation to define what it regards as indispensable , what it considers unacceptable , and what it is ready to give in exchange for what it wants .
