The ECB Picks Up The Pace 
Buoyant US economic growth , so far , has provided the European Central Bank with the necessary global backdrop to raise interest rates from very low levels at a slow and steady pace that limits political friction with euro-zone political leaders but that gets the job done . 
That is about to change . 
The latest anecdotal evidence from the US indicates that the economy is taking a sharp downward turn , which should become manifest in the coming months . 
Unless the ECB picks up the pace of interest-rate increases now , the goal of interest-rate neutrality may not be politically feasible , jeopardizing achievement of the bank &apos;s price stability goals . 
The ECB should act with greater alacrity not because there are increased prospects for future growth , but for the opposite reason : the fear that European growth will slow , thus limiting the possibility for future rate hikes . 
Indeed , even before the sudden downturn in the US economy , a growing number of members of the ECB &apos;s Governing Council already had come to the conclusion that accelerating the pace of interest-rate increases was needed if its goal of monetary neutrality was to be achieved . 
The key reason is that several recent &quot; reforms &quot; announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel - raising the value-added tax , increasing user charges for healthcare , and taxing interest payments as a part of so-called corporate tax reform - promise to reduce German economic growth , perhaps significantly , in 2007 . 
When Germany sneezes , Europe catches a cold . 
As a result , Merkel &apos;s reforms have increased the angst of euro-zone central bankers that the &quot; window of opportunity &quot; for future rate hikes might be closing . 
The latest ZEW survey of euro-zone business confidence buttresses these fears . 
It shows that current conditions are good , but that expectations about future conditions have dropped off significantly . 
The message for the ECB is clear : make haste while the sun shines . 
That is exactly what the ECB is doing . 
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet indicated at his July press conference that the bank plans to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on August 3 , not August 31 , as expected . 
This implies an interval of two months between interest-rate moves instead of the three-month interval that has become standard ECB practice in the current interest-rate cycle . 
The next rate hike in the normalization process is expected in October , two months after the expected August move . 
Ironically , the October meeting of the ECB &apos;s Governing Council will take place in Paris this year . 
French politicians have been the most aggressive in putting political pressure on the ECB to relax its interest-rate normalization policy . 
French Finance Minister Thierry Breton recently warned the ECB about &quot; nasty surprises . &quot; 
Prospective French presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy wants the ECB to promote economic growth , not just price stability . 
The Paris meeting affords the ECB an opportunity to make a political statement - its &quot; Declaration of Independence , &quot; so to speak - by raising interest rates on French soil . 
Trichet already has cleared the way for this to happen . 
In June , the ECB jettisoned its long-standing practice of not changing rates outside of Frankfurt , increasing them by 25 basis points in Madrid . 
Trichet is a clever and resourceful person . 
But even he might find it daunting to reconcile the conflicting demands of the ECB to accelerate the interest-rate normalization process and those of the French political establishment to maintain the status quo . 
But the recent good economic numbers coming out of France should make an October rate hike easier for French politicians to accept . 
The ECB is accelerating the pace of normalization at precisely the right moment . 
The danger is that it will be blamed if European growth falters . 
However , with the German and US economies slowing precipitously , the ECB would have a perfect cover for its interest-rate moves . 
The ECB could convincingly argue that Merkel &apos;s reforms and the US , not its interest-rate hikes , are responsible for the European slowdown , should one occur . 
Politically , the path is clear for the ECB to act .
