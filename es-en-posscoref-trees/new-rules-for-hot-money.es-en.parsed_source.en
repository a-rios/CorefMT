New Rules for Hot Money 
NEW YORK - Capital flows to emerging-market economies have been on a boom-bust merry-go-round for decades . 
In the past year , the world has seen another boom , with a tsunami of capital , portfolio equity , and fixed-income investments surging into emerging-market countries perceived as having strong macroeconomic , policy , and financial fundamentals . 
Such inflows are driven in part by short-term cyclical factors ( interest-rate differentials and a wall of liquidity chasing higher-yielding assets as zero policy rates and more quantitative easing reduce opportunities in the sluggish advanced economies ) . 
But longer-term secular factors also play a role . 
These include emerging markets &quot; long-term growth differentials relative to advanced economies ; investors &quot; greater willingness to diversify beyond their home markets ; and the expectation of long-term nominal and real appreciation of emerging-market currencies . 
Given all this , the most critical policy question in emerging markets today is how to respond to inflows that will inevitably drive up their exchange rates and threaten export-led growth . 
The first option is to do nothing and allow the currency to appreciate . 
This may be the right response if the inflows and upward pressure on the exchange rate are driven by fundamental factors ( a current-account surplus , an undervalued currency , a large and persistent growth differential ) . 
But , in many cases , inflows are driven by short-term factors , fads , and irrational exuberance , which can lead to an overvalued currency , the crowding out of non-traditional export sectors or import-competing sectors , a loss of competitiveness , and eventually a large current-account deficit and thus tighter external constraints on growth . 
This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the world &apos;s biggest exporter , China , is aggressively intervening to minimize any appreciation of the renminbi . 
If China doesn &apos;t allow the renminbi to strengthen , other emerging markets will remain wary of letting their currencies appreciate too much and lose competitiveness . 
If allowing a currency to appreciate freely is costly , the second option is unsterilized foreign-exchange intervention . 
This is effective in stemming upward exchange-rate pressure , but it feeds the beast : it exacerbates overheating in already fast-growing emerging markets , causing inflation and leading to excessive credit growth , which can fuel dangerous asset bubbles . 
The third option is sterilized intervention . 
This prevents monetary and credit growth , but , by keeping interest-rate differentials high , sterilized intervention feeds carry-trade inflows , thus contributing to the problem that it was supposed to solve . 
The fourth option is to impose capital controls on inflows ( or liberalize controls on outflows ) . Leaving aside the issue of whether or not such controls are &quot; leaky , &quot; evidence suggests that controls on inflows of short-term &quot; hot money &quot; do not affect the overall amount of capital inflows . 
Thus , such controls are ineffective in reducing short-term cyclical pressure on the currency to appreciate . 
The fifth option is to tighten fiscal policy and reduce budget deficits with the aim of lowering the high interest rates that drive the inflows . 
But sounder fiscal policy might lead to even higher inflows as the country &apos;s external balance and sovereign-risk outlook improve . 
A sixth option - especially where a country has carried out partially sterilized intervention to prevent excessive currency appreciation - is to reduce the risk of credit and asset bubbles by imposing prudential supervision of the financial system . 
This should be aimed at restraining excessive credit growth , which the monetary growth that follows currency intervention would otherwise cause . 
However , direct controls on credit growth , while necessary , are often leaky and not very binding in practice . 
The final option is massive , large-scale , and permanent sterilized intervention - or , equivalently , the use of sovereign wealth funds or other fiscal-stabilization mechanisms - to accumulate the foreign assets needed to compensate for the effects on the currency &apos;s value brought about by long-term inflows . 
The argument for this option is that long-term secular factors are important drivers of capital inflows , as advanced-economy investors discover that they are underweight in emerging-market assets and reduce their portfolios &quot; &quot; home bias . &quot; 
Sterilized intervention usually doesn &apos;t work : if assets in advanced economies and emerging markets remain perfectly substitutable , inflows will continue as long as interest-rate differentials persist . 
But the demand for emerging-market assets is neither infinite nor perfectly substitutable for the assets of advanced economies - even for given interest-rate differentials - because these assets have very different liquidity and credit risks . 
This means that at some point large-scale , persistent sterilized foreign-exchange intervention - amounting to several percentage points of GDP - would satisfy the additional demand for emerging-market assets and stop the inflows , even if interest-rate differentials remain . 
As sterilization induces issuance of domestic assets , global investors &quot; desire for diversification would be met without causing excessive currency appreciation , with all its collateral damage , in emerging markets . 
Of course , currency appreciation should not be prevented altogether . 
When justified by economic fundamentals , the exchange rate should be allowed to rise gradually . 
But when a currency &apos;s appreciation is triggered by capital inflows that represent the asset-diversification preferences of advanced-economy investors , it can and should be resisted .
