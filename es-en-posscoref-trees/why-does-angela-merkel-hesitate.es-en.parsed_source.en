Why Does Angela Merkel Hesitate ? 
MUNICH - &quot; Where is Angela ? &quot; is the question The Economist asked when Nicolas Sarkozy , Gordon Brown , and José Manuel Barroso met to prepare a European economic stimulus plan without Chancellor Merkel being present . 
Indeed , Germany is currently the spoiler in the competition to provide billions to prevent a breakdown of the world economy . 
Why is Germany so hesitant when it comes to economic stimulus programs ? 
One popular theory is that , given the supply-side orientation of German economists , there is little sympathy for Keynesian , demand-oriented prescriptions . 
Whereas Keynesian theory has largely disappeared from economic textbooks in the United States , it continues to be taught everywhere in Germany . 
German economists , in contrast to their American colleagues , never abandoned Keynesian policies as a means to combat demand deficits . 
Moreover , German politicians rarely heed the advice of German economists . 
A second hypothesis is closer to the truth : the decline of economic activity in Germany thus far has not been as strong as in other countries . 
Germany did not have a real-estate bubble that threatened to burst , as did Great Britain , Ireland , Spain , and France . 
Germany has only been indirectly affected - by the decline in worldwide demand for German products - which explains an important timing difference in the business cycle . 
Whereas unemployment in the US has been rising for one and a half years , Germany currently is enjoying its lowest unemployment rate in 16 years . 
The German construction industry and retailing are still stable , as the latest survey of the Ifo Institute shows , and the whole world is profiting from this stability , as Germany is the second largest importer of goods and services after the US . 
While US imports are declining sharply , German imports are holding up -without any economic stimulus plan . 
This is why many Germans wonder whether the foreign criticism is fair . 
To be sure , the world recession will hit Germany with full force . 
The Ifo Institute has forecast that GDP will contract by 2.2 % in 2009 . 
These are areas where there is not much that the state can do to help . 
It can cut taxes to stimulate consumption and it can invest in construction , but these sectors currently need little help , except perhaps for the automobile industry . 
This could , of course , quickly change . 
When the second-round effects hit the domestic sector in the course of 2009 , a stimulus program will be needed . 
From the German perspective , the best timing for such a program would be the autumn of next year . 
If the money is spent now , the economy in some sectors could overheat , helping no one . 
Paul Krugman , who has aimed massive criticism at Germany &apos;s government , should keep this in mind . 
Krugman is an excellent economist . 
He is right in principle in demanding a major economic stimulus package from the German government that goes beyond the € 35 billion already planned . 
Germany should prepare its economic stimulus program now and implement it when the time comes . 
A third hypothesis to explain Germany &apos;s hesitancy is suspicion of the European Union &apos;s redistribution machinery . 
When Sarkozy and other EU leaders demand Germany &apos;s participation in an economic stimulus and rescue package , one reason is that they expect Germany to again bear the lion &apos;s share of the costs . 
For example , of the € 5 billion extension of the Cohesion Funds approved by the European Parliament in December 2007 , Germany received nothing , but it bears 20 % of the costs . 
Germans have always been enthusiastic proponents of the EU , not least because they hoped that a European identity would help compensate for their damaged national identity . 
So , whenever it came to restructuring the EU , they always accepted a level of influence that was small relative to their country &apos;s size . 
Although Germany &apos;s share of the EU population is 17 % , it receives 13 % of the voting rights in the EU Parliament . 
Its share in the more important Council of Ministers is only 8 % , the same as that of the French , whose population share is 13 % . 
Former French President Jacques Chirac did not hesitate to justify this imbalance with a reference to World War II , which the Germans accepted . 
After all , aside from political under-representation , Germany &apos;s annual contribution to the EU budget ( most recently € 7.4 billion ) makes the country by far the largest net contributor . 
Germany finances 20 % of the EU budget but receives only 12 % of EU spending . 
Willingness could be exhausted if the EU budget is further expanded without reducing Germany &apos;s net contribution and narrowing the gap between its financing and voting rights . 
For these reasons , German reservations also extend to the European economic government that Sarkozy advocates , and that , again , would be financed more than proportionately with German money . 
Sarkozy regards an EU economic government as a way to preserve his leadership in the EU beyond France &apos;s Council presidency , which is now ending . 
Although the Czech Republic will assume the EU presidency in January , this has not prevented the French President from convening a new EU summit under Sarkozy &apos;s leadership in the first half of 2009 . 
This affront will put not only Czech tolerance to the test , but also that of Merkel . 
In the end , she will probably give in to Sarkozy &apos;s wishes in order to avoid endangering her chances of re-election in September because of a conflict with the French .
