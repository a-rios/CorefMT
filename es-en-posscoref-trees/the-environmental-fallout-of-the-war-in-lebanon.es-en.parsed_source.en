The Environmental Fallout of the War in Lebanon 
In any war , the primary focus is on dead , wounded and displaced people . 
The number of people killed as a result of Israel &apos;s offensive in Lebanon at the time of this writing is reported to be roughly 800 Lebanese and 120 Israelis - not an atypical ratio for Arab-Israeli conflicts . 
The UN estimates the number of displaced persons to be more than a million , about 800,000 of them Lebanese . 
Damage to infrastructure and the environment will also continue to be felt once hostilities cease . 
Of course , infrastructure can be rebuilt much more quickly than the environment can be restored or recover on its own . 
In the case of Lebanon , however , the two are closely linked , as much of the environmental damage comes from destroyed infrastructure . 
As in most modern wars , oil spills are one of the most visible - and therefore most reported - forms of environmental damage . 
Until the war started , Lebanon &apos;s beaches were among the cleanest in the Mediterranean . 
They are now to a large extent covered with oil . 
For a rare species of sea turtle this is bad news , as the eggs laid in the sand on those very beaches in the annual spawning season are due to hatch at precisely this time of the year . 
The total amount of oil released into the sea is now well over 100,000 tons . 
Naturally , oil cisterns are not the only targets , and coastal locations are not the only regions hit . 
It is far too early to assess the damage done by releases of other , less visible , chemicals , but it is safe to assume that ground water will be contaminated for a long time . 
The drier the environment , the worse the problem . 
Moreover , bombs and grenades not only ignite buildings , but also grass , bushes , and trees . 
The number of forest and brush fires that start is thus much higher than during a normal summer . 
Worse still , there is little capacity to fight them , as existing fire-fighting resources are used to try to save human lives . 
Consequently , bushes and forests burn , reducing the stands of cedar trees - a symbol of Lebanon as much as the bald eagle is of the United States - by the day towards extinction . 
A unique ecosystem is being lost . 
There have also been reports , more often on the Internet than in the press , about despairing Lebanese doctors , who , not recognizing the wounds patients have sustained after Israeli air strikes , have described what they see and asked colleagues around the world for help . 
One such type of wound reportedly resembles second-degree burns over large parts of bodies , but with the hairs intact - not a typical reaction to fire and heat . 
There have been suggestions that agents containing some acid or alkali were possibly stored in buildings destroyed in the bombing . 
According to this theory , such agents were dispersed after a missile or bomb hit , rather than being delivered with incoming warheads . 
The last word probably has not been heard . 
One has only to recall &quot; Gulf War Syndrome , &quot; which emerged after the 1991 conflict , and the controversy surrounding the issue of what , if anything , affected US soldiers , to understand how difficult it can be to answer such questions until well after the fact . 
The worst environmental effect on health is probably the one most directly associated with the destruction of infrastructure : the release of asbestos . 
As in many parts of the world with hot climates , apartment and office buildings in Lebanon use asbestos for heat insulation . 
This has been standard practice for decades , and most buildings that have been erected or restored since Israel &apos;s last bombings in 1982 have plenty of it . 
When pulverized by bombs and missiles , asbestos fibers are freed and can be inhaled with the rest of the dust . 
The protective suits that specially-trained people are legally required to wear in the European Union or the US when demolishing , rebuilding , or repairing any building containing asbestos underscore the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer for Lebanese who inhale dust from bombed-out houses and offices . 
Indeed , US companies have been forced to pay tens of billions of dollars to ex-employees who worked with asbestos . 
Lebanon cannot afford to pay anything close to such a sum . 
But this is just one of many environmental debts that will somehow have to be paid in long after the fighting has stopped - by the victims , if by nobody else .
