A Tricky Trade Treaty 
When is a free-trade agreement bad ? 
When the treaty &apos;s underlying purpose is neither about trade nor freedom . 
Such a pact - calling for a &quot; united economic space &quot; - is now being entered into by Russia , Ukraine , Kazakhstan , and Belarus . 
On the surface , a &quot; united economic space &quot; sounds like something to applaud . 
But , sadly , the treaty will only entrench postcommunism &apos;s corrupt and criminal business practices , not increase trade or prosperity . 
A huge benefit for the accession countries in preparing themselves to join the EU was that they were forced to conform to European business , political , and legal norms . 
The proposed &quot; united economic space &quot; will also have its own norms - the ways of the oligarch , the corrupt bureaucrat , the crony capitalist , and the politically motivated prosecutor . 
Does anyone doubt that the jailing of Mikhail Khodorkovsky , chairman of Yukos oil , is politically motivated ? 
I myself have endured numerous politically inspired investigations and prosecutions of my former business as a means to drive me out of politics . 
Can anyone imagine such a prosecution occurring in the EU ? 
That Mr. Khodorkovsky is spending months in jail before he is formally charged tells us much about the nature of business , politics , and law in the nations of the former Soviet Union . 
In the countries of the &quot; united economic space , &quot; the rule of law typically means , &quot; I rule , and I am the law . &quot; 
So , instead of promoting growth , the &quot; united economic space &quot; will retard it by discouraging competition and investment . 
Instead of enhancing European stability , it will undermine it by dividing Europe into the EU &apos;s single market and an economic trading area ruled by arbitrary fiat and decree . 
But , as a matter of economic principle , practical diplomacy , and visionary politics , aren &apos;t regional free-trade areas at least a step in the right direction ? 
After all , countries that scrap tariffs among themselves trade more and often raise their economic grow rates as a result . 
Moreover , free-trade agreements are typically seen as politically valuable : countries tied by commerce are supposedly less likely to shoot at each other . 
Unfortunately , the &quot; united economic space &quot; promises no such benefits . 
By definition , it discriminates against countries outside the club , with which trade will not be liberalized . 
Members will specialize in industries in which they lack comparative advantage , undercutting the main reason to support free trade in the first place . 
Worse yet , markets will be carved up for political , not commercial , reasons , locking in inefficiencies . 
The &quot; political &quot; argument - that regional trade bodies promote peaceful foreign relations - is simply wrongheaded in the post-Soviet case . 
After all , Ukraine managed to eliminate its nuclear weapons and reach accommodation over the Black Sea fleet without joining a private economic bloc with Russia . 
On the other hand , not long after the &quot; united economic space &quot; was announced , Russia began to cast covetous eyes on the Ukrainian Black Sea island of Tuszla . 
Economic borders cannot and will not disappear until Russia and Ukraine agree on their territorial borders . 
Because the proposed members of this new &quot; united economic space &quot; share Russian as a 
But the &quot; united economic space &quot; is also a perversion because the presence of Belarus and Kazakstan will ensure that democracy remains low on the agenda . 
Another perversion of democracy is the fact that the supra-national body that is to administer the &quot; united economic space &quot; grants Ukraine and its 49 million people only 9.9 % of votes , while it gives Russia and its 140 million people 83 % . 
That gross imbalance in representation is a shameful betrayal of Ukraine &apos;s sovereignty . 
It is a deal that can only have been agreed to as the price of Russian support for Ukraine &apos;s President Leonid Kuchma as he desperately seeks to extend his presidency beyond the two-term limit that he faces this year . 
My opposition to the &quot; united economic space &quot; is not opposition to Russia . 
The more Ukraine trades abroad , the better ; if more of that open trade goes Russia &apos;s way , so be it . 
But that trade should reflect Ukraine &apos;s competing with the world , unconstrained by a private deal that excludes outsiders and their demands for a stable and predictable legal environment and the best business practices . 
I am not one of those people who think Russia is so naturally collectivist that free trade and an open economy cannot work there . 
Nor do I believe that Russia is so inherently autocratic that democracy must invariably fail . 
But I do believe that , for these canards to be discarded , Russia and Ukraine must open themselves to global competition , not isolate themselves with each other . 
Dmitri Likhachev , one of Russia &apos;s most respected intellectuals in the communist era , said that there is no such thing as the Russian soul ; &quot; we can create whatever future we want . &quot; 
Ukraine and Russia , too , can create the future they want , but not by closing themselves off in a &quot; united economic space &quot; that , in reality , is nothing more than another dark corner .
