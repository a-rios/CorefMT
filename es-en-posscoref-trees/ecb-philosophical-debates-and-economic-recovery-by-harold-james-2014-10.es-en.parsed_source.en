The New Philosophers 
PRINCETON - At the recent meeting of G-20 finance ministers in Australia , US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew noted &quot; philosophical differences with some of our friends in Europe , &quot; before urging Europeans to do more to boost their anemic growth rate . 
The terminology is striking , and underscores the difficulty of Europe &apos;s search for a way out of its current malaise . 
Canada &apos;s finance minister , Joe Oliver , joined the call for fiscal expansion in Europe - a position for which there seems to be some support within the European Central Bank . 
Indeed , ECB President Mario Draghi has advocated higher spending by more fiscally strong countries like Germany . 
And ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure , together with his former colleague JÃ¶rg Asmussen , currently Germany &apos;s deputy labor minister , recently suggested that Germany should &quot; use its available room for maneuver to promote investments and reduce the tax burden of workers . &quot; 
In fact , most of the world believes that Germany should adopt a more expansive fiscal policy . 
According to this view , austerity is counter-productive , because it induces slowdowns and recessions that make long-term fiscal consolidation more difficult . 
But Germans - as well as some other Northern Europeans , and perhaps some Chinese economists - remain reticent . 
They believe that responding to calls for stimulus would simply lead to more such calls , creating a log-rolling , pork-barrel dynamic in which any hope for fiscal consolidation is ruled out . 
The stimulus-versus-austerity debate is an old one . 
In the 1970s and 1980s , the United States regularly called on Germany and Japan to act as locomotives for the global economy . 
Americans wanted additional demand for their goods and higher prices , while the Germans and Japanese defended their export industries . 
The problem today , as Lew &apos;s recent statement highlighted , stems from deeply entrenched differences between the opposing sides &quot; belief systems , with ideological questions about fairness and responsibility trumping pragmatic discussion of the best way forward for everyone . 
As the historian Robert Kagan argued in 2002 , Americans and Europeans do not only have different worldviews ; they occupy entirely different worlds . 
Philosophical differences are extremely difficult to reconcile . 
Just as Platonists and Aristotelians struggled against one another for millennia , Kantians and utilitarians have been at one another &apos;s throats for centuries . 
Such deep theoretical conflicts have real-world consequences , as they impede constructive debate and cooperative action in crisis situations . 
Fundamental ideological divisions over the 2003 Iraq war have strained global politics for more than a decade . 
Modern political processes and structures are simply not well suited for conducting - much less settling - philosophical disputes . 
Democratic institutions are designed for making deals between competing interests , with parliaments specializing in finding the right combination of concessions to enable agreement on a generally accepted solution . 
Likewise , international forums like the G-20 exist precisely to persuade a large number of vastly different countries to set aside philosophical questions for the sake of their shared economic , political , or security interests . 
Philosophies do not just give a little here and there , blurring over the difficult bits in the hope that everything will work out in the end . 
Imagine asking a Kantian to add just a bit of utilitarian calculation to the categorical imperative . 
Of course , resolving a philosophical debate is not impossible . 
It was standard pre-modern practice to overcome such differences with a formal disputation . 
In the early sixteenth century , the German princes attempted to settle the philosophical challenge presented by Protestant reformers by engaging Martin Luther to debate a prominent orthodox Catholic theologian , Johannes Eck . 
There are not that many modern varieties of this sort of practice , but the 1944 United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods comes close . 
By systemically engaging with the economic issues involved in building a viable international system , experts created a new global economic and political order . 
In a sense , central banks have begun to resemble medieval philosophical faculties , with discussions addressing the issues underlying policy decisions , rather than just the policies themselves . 
In the ECB , for example , a debate is underway to determine under which conditions deviation from fiscal orthodoxy might be stabilizing in the long term . 
How that debate is resolved could lead to a new kind of international cooperation . 
At a time when political processes are stalled on both sides of the Atlantic , the US Federal Reserve and the ECB have been engaging in a series of policy innovations , feeling their way toward a solution that could promote and sustain economic recovery . 
On this basis , the ECB is recasting itself as the incubator of a new intellectual and philosophical synthesis . 
But central banks &quot; new role as supreme arbiters of policy truth is fraught with hazard . 
Given that the solutions that emerge from their disputations and analyses will be the product of technocratic - not democratic - processes , they are likely to trigger populist backlashes . 
Moreover , the policy approaches that central banks produce may be too complex and interlinked to function efficiently . 
In particular , the attempt to make expansionary policies conditional on the implementation of a host of microeconomic reforms is problematic . 
If only some parts of a complex package linking fiscal leeway with structural reform are realized , the outcome is likely to disappoint - or even prove counterproductive . 
When it does , the old philosophical divisions are likely to resurface .
