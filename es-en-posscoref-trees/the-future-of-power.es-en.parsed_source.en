The Future of Power 
CAMBRIDGE - Global government is unlikely in the twenty-first century , but various degrees of global governance already exist . 
The world has hundreds of treaties , institutions , and regimes for governing interstate behavior involving telecommunications , civil aviation , ocean dumping , trade , and even the proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
They still require the leadership of great powers . 
As the power of China and India increases , how will their behavior change ? 
Ironically , for those who foresee a tri-polar world of the US , China , and India at mid-century , all three of these states - the world &apos;s most populous - are among the most protective of their sovereignty . 
Some argue that our current global institutions are sufficiently open and adaptable for China to find it in its own interests to become what Robert Zoellick , president of the World Bank , once called a &quot; responsible stakeholder . &quot; 
Others believe that China will wish to impose its own mark and create its own international institutional system as its power increases . 
The countries of the European Union have been more willing to experiment with limiting state sovereignty , and they may push for more institutional innovation . 
But it is unlikely that , barring a disaster like World War II , the world will witness &quot; a constitutional moment &quot; such as it experienced with the creation of the United Nations system of institutions after 1945 . 
Today , as a universal institution , the UN plays a crucial role in legitimization , crisis diplomacy , peacekeeping , and humanitarian missions , but its very size has proven to be a disadvantage for many other functions . 
As the 2009 UN climate-change summit in Copenhagen demonstrated , meetings of 192 states are often unwieldy and subject to bloc politics and tactical moves by largely extraneous players that otherwise lack the resources to solve functional problems . 
As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it recently , &quot; the UN remains the single most important global institution ... but we are constantly reminded of its limitations .... The UN was never intended to tackle every challenge ; nor should it . &quot; 
Indeed , the main dilemma that the international community faces is how to include everyone and still be able to act . 
The answer is likely to lie in what Europeans have dubbed &quot; variable geometry . &quot; 
There will be many multilateralisms and &quot; mini-lateralisms , &quot; which will vary by issue with the distribution of power resources . 
For example , on monetary affairs , the Bretton Woods conference created the International Monetary Fund in 1944 , and it has since expanded to include 186 countries . 
But the dollar &apos;s global pre-eminence was the crucial feature of monetary cooperation until the 1970 &quot; s . 
After the weakening of the dollar and President Richard M. Nixon &apos;s decision to end its convertibility into gold , in 1975 France convened leaders of five countries in the library of the Chateau de Rambouillet to discuss monetary affairs . 
The group soon grew to seven , and later broadened in scope and membership - including Russia and a vast bureaucratic and press apparatus - to become the G-8 . 
Subsequently , the G-8 began the practice of inviting five guests from the emerging economies . 
In the financial crisis of 2008 , this framework evolved into the G-20 , which boasts a more inclusive membership . 
At the same time , the G-7 continued to meet on a narrower monetary agenda ; new institutions , such as the Financial Stability Board , were created , while bilateral discussions between the US and China played an increasingly important role . 
As one experienced diplomat put it , &quot; if you &apos;re trying to negotiate an exchange-rate deal with 20 countries or a bailout of Mexico , as in the early Clinton days , with 20 countries , that &apos;s not easy . 
If you get above 10 , it just makes it too darn hard to get things done . &quot; 
He &apos;s right , of course . 
After all , with three countries , there are three bilateral relationships ; with ten , there are 45 ; and with 100 players , there are nearly 5,000 . 
That is why , on issues like climate change , the UN will continue to play a role , but more intensive negotiations are likely to occur in smaller groups such as the Major Economies Forum , where fewer than a dozen countries account for 80 % of greenhouse gas emissions . 
Much of the work of global governance will rely on formal and informal networks . 
Network organizations ( such as the G-20 ) are used for setting agendas , building consensus , coordinating policy , exchanging knowledge , and establishing norms . 
As Anne-Marie Slaughter , Director of Policy Planning in the US State Department , argues , &quot; the power that flows from this type of connectivity is not the power to impose outcomes . 
Networks are not directed and controlled as much as they are managed and orchestrated . 
Multiple players are integrated into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts . &quot; 
In other words , the network provides power to achieve preferred outcomes with other players rather than over them . To cope with the transnational challenges that characterize a global information age , the international community will have to continue to develop a series of complementary networks and institutions that supplement the global framework of the UN . 
But if major countries are divided , it is unlikely that even network organizations like the G-20 can set the agenda for the UN and the Bretton Woods financial institutions to act upon . 
In the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis , the G-20 seemed to help governments to coordinate their actions and avoid rampant protectionism . 
The world waits anxiously to see how it will perform when it meets again in Seoul this November .
