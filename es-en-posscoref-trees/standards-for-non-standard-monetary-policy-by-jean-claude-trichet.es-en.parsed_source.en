Standards for Non-Standard Monetary Policy 
PARIS - The widespread introduction of unconventional monetary-policy measures by major central banks has been a defining characteristic of the global financial crisis . 
We have seen enhanced credit support , credit easing , quantitative easing , interventions in currency and securities markets , and the provision of liquidity in foreign currency - to name but a few of the measures taken . 
Some view these measures as a continuation of standard policy by other means . 
Once nominal interest rates cannot be lowered further , central banks use other tools to determine the monetary-policy stance . 
They have reached the end of the road , so they shift into four-wheel drive : they expand their balance sheets and inject liquidity to influence the structure of yields and returns and thereby stimulate aggregate demand . 
Say that key interest rates are to be set at levels considered appropriate to maintain price stability , drawing on regular , comprehensive assessment of economic and monetary conditions . 
Following standard practice , interest rates can be more or less significantly positive , very close to zero , or at zero . 
But , whatever the level of nominal interest rates , the monetary-policy stance established in this way has often been poorly transmitted to the economy , particularly in times of acute crisis . 
During the financial crisis , market functioning was impaired , at times very profoundly . 
Non-standard measures helped to clear standard measures &quot; transmission path . 
By this logic , if the transmission of standard measures is impeded in a significant way , non-standard measures can offer support . 
Policymakers are not obliged to unwind non-standard measures before considering interest-rate increases , or to push interest rates to the zero lower bound before considering unconventional measures . 
Standard measures depend on the medium- and long-term outlook for price stability , whereas non-standard measures depend on the degree of dysfunction of the monetary-policy transmission mechanism . 
This second view has characterized the European Central Bank &apos;s approach to monetary policy since the start of the financial crisis . 
The ECB &apos;s first non-standard measure - unlimited supply of liquidity at fixed rates against appropriate collateral - was introduced in August 2007 , when the minimum bid rate of its main refinancing operation was 4.25 % - nowhere near the zero bound . 
Non-standard measures were required to ensure that the monetary-policy stance would be more effectively transmitted to the broader economy , notwithstanding the dislocations observed in some financial markets . 
Obvious , unconventional measures , if not carefully monitored , might have the unintended consequence of creating an abnormally benign financial environment for markets , commercial banks , and sovereigns . 
As a result , non-standard measures must satisfy five conditions . 
First , they must be as commensurate as possible with the degree of market dislocation and disruption of market that they aim to counter , which is always a matter of judgment . 
In most cases , the measures must be tailored to avoid the total disruption of markets . 
The ECB has never hesitated to increase or decrease the scope of its non-standard tools - in particular , the duration of the non-standard supply of liquidity - depending on the abnormality in the functioning of the financial system . 
Second , the measures must be accompanied by forceful messages to commercial banks to address their medium-term recapitalization and balance-sheet-repair issues . 
To the extent that banks are , by far , the ECB &apos;s main instrument for &quot; non-standard &quot; refinancing , this message is particularly important in Europe . 
Third , the measures must be accompanied by equally forceful messages , when and where needed , to the governments concerned . 
When non-standard measures are required because of loss of confidence in sovereign debt , such messages must seek to avoid the measures &quot; failure by highlighting the risk of major additional difficulties in the future . 
Fourth , in the case of Europe , the European Union institutions , as well as the member states , must be urged to strengthen economic governance , including through close monitoring of individual countries &quot; economic and budgetary policies . 
The ECB &apos;s governing council has been highly vocal on this issue since the start of the crisis . 
Finally , to the extent that the combined non-standard measures of the advanced economies &quot; central banks are creating a very substantial structural change in the global economy &apos;s monetary and financial environment , it seems necessary to call for the appropriate reinforcement of global governance . 
As long as these central banks consider non-standard measures necessary , they are entitled to be vocal advocates of the necessary reforms of global finance ; the necessary adjustment of global imbalances within the framework of the G-20 ; and the decisive contribution of multilateral lenders . 
The ECB &apos;s decision in December 2011 to launch its long-term refinancing operation , which supplies low-cost three-year financing to commercial banks , meets these five conditions . 
The LTRO &apos;s duration , in particular , is appropriate , given the growing threat of major dysfunction in the European banking sector in October , November , and at the beginning of December last year . 
Moreover , ECB President Mario Draghi , my successor , made loud and clear the importance of reinforcing banks &quot; balance sheets , adjusting individual countries &quot; strategies , and improving governance in the eurozone and the EU as a whole . 
In all of these domains , as well as at the global level , where reform is equally urgent , there is no longer any room for complacency .
