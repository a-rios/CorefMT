The Changing Map of Middle East Power 
BERLIN - The eruption of the Arab revolts in late 2010 and early 2011 put power relations among Middle Eastern countries in a state of flux , and both winners and losers have emerged . 
But , given that the strengths and weaknesses of most of the actors are highly contingent , the regional balance of power remains highly fluid . 
As that balance currently stands , Egypt continues to be one of the region &apos;s most influential actors , with the success or failure of its political and economic transition affecting how other Arab countries develop . 
But Egypt is weighed down by domestic concerns , including a plummeting economy and a security situation in which the military is used for police tasks . 
The expansion of Egypt &apos;s soft power will depend on the ability of its first democratically elected government , led by President Mohamed Morsi , to take difficult decisions and forge domestic consensus . 
Success in establishing effective governance would establish a model that many of Egypt &apos;s neighbors would seek to emulate , at least partly . 
In this respect , Turkey is a good example . 
Turkey &apos;s power rests primarily on its vibrant economy . 
Its impressive military strength is of limited use as an instrument of power , and its political clout has been overestimated , particularly in Syria . 
A rapprochement with Israel and , more important , a lasting peace with its Kurdish population , would boost Turkey &apos;s regional influence . 
Israel also remains an overall winner , despite the changing strategic environment and its virtual lack of soft power in the region . 
The impending fall of Israel &apos;s most reliable enemy , Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , concerns Israel almost as much as the loss of its ally , Egypt &apos;s former President Hosni Mubarak . 
With Israel &apos;s economy and deterrent capability stronger than ever , however , no regional player poses a genuine security threat to Israel in the short term . 
Meanwhile , Qatar &apos;s diligent efforts to expand its influence over the last two decades have paid off , with the country developing considerable power of attraction . 
Since 2011 , Qatar has scaled up its involvement in its neighbors &quot; affairs , backing the Libyan revolution , the Egyptian government , and the Syrian opposition . 
But the Qataris may be overplaying their hand . 
Qatar has money , but no other hard power , and it has been criticized for its interference in Syria and its support for the Muslim Brotherhood . 
If Qatar fails to use its resources wisely , it may lose the legitimacy that it needs to underpin its patronage . 
Meanwhile , Syria &apos;s civil war highlights the loss of that country &apos;s once-considerable influence in the region . 
Instead , Syria has become the object of a geopolitical struggle among other regional actors . 
But the efforts of the Gulf states to arm the Syrian opposition are insufficient to set the conflict on a definitive course , especially given the heavy weapons that the Assad regime has at its disposal . 
And the opposition has not been able to appropriate the reputation and clout that Assad has lost . 
In fact , regardless of the balance of power between the regime and its opponents , Syria probably will not reestablish a strong , centralized government for decades , if ever . 
At best , Syria will emerge from the current conflict with a decentralized or federal state ; at worst , the country will go the way of Somalia . 
Either way , Syria is currently firmly in the loser &apos;s camp . 
Iraq could have been a winner , had it been able to translate the recovery of its oil industry and the withdrawal of US troops into political stabilization and regional influence . 
But , with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki &apos;s government widely considered to be another authoritarian and sectarian regime , Iraq has not been able to gain any soft power . 
Moreover , the chances that Iraqi Kurdistan will achieve de facto or de jure independence are greater than ever . 
Iraq &apos;s Kurds may even be able to extend their influence into Kurdish-populated northern Syria , thereby becoming a more influential regional player than the Iraqi government in Baghdad . 
Neighboring Iran seems to be the quintessential survivor . 
It has coped with the international community &apos;s increasingly stifling sanctions , while maintaining its nuclear program and continuing to participate in the diplomatic process with the P5 + 1 ( the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , plus Germany ) . 
Iran has strengthened its influence in Iraq , and has helped to keep the Assad regime , a key ally , in power much longer than expected . 
But rising political polarization in the region could undermine Iran &apos;s standing . 
As regional conflicts are increasingly defined along Sunni-Shia lines , it is becoming more difficult for Shia-dominated Iran to gain influence in Sunni-majority countries . 
And Iran &apos;s support for Assad &apos;s brutal regime in Syria is damaging further its once-considerable soft power in other Arab countries . 
Saudi Arabia can also be counted as a survivor , as it copes with deep strategic insecurity stemming from Iran &apos;s efforts to undermine its position , social unrest in its neighbor and ally Bahrain , and the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s rise to power in Egypt . 
Saudi leaders have also become increasingly suspicious of their American allies , on whom the country &apos;s security depends . 
At the same time , the Saudi leadership is facing significant domestic challenges , including vast economic disparities , inadequate services , growing frustration with the lack of political freedom , and a difficult succession process within the royal family . 
Nevertheless , though Saudi Arabia &apos;s soft power is waning , its massive oil wealth will likely ensure that it remains a regional heavyweight . 
Non-state actors also play a crucial role in the Middle East &apos;s balance of power . 
Religious minorities have become more insecure . 
The once-oppressed Kurds are gaining ground . 
Of the main transnational political groups , the Muslim Brotherhood has been the clearest winner . 
But success brings new challenges . 
Islamist-led governments must deliver on the socioeconomic front , while building democratic institutions . 
( Ironically , they will be able to claim success in having built a better state only when they accept their first electoral defeat . ) 
Indeed , the challenge facing all of the region &apos;s current winners is to translate today &apos;s gains into credible , long-term power .
