The \ 
Samuel Huntington did alert us to the danger . 
In his now famous thesis on the &quot; Clash of Civilizations &quot; he gave Turkey as an example of a &quot; torn country , &quot; one divided internally , according to him , between East and West , a country neither in Europe nor in the Middle East , with a fault line running within rather than at the border . 
The recent bombings in Istanbul underscore , once again , the importance of Turkey &apos;s overcoming Huntington &apos;s fault line to emerge firmly as a prosperous , secular and stable democracy . 
If Turkey succeeds , it will show that there is nothing inevitable about the 21 st century becoming one of a &quot; Clash of Civilizations , &quot; during which the Cold War &apos;s divisions are replaced by new religious antagonisms that resemble the Middle Ages . 
The concept of borders itself must be rethought in today &apos;s world : borders that run in minds and on the internet are as important as lines that divide geographical space . 
Turkey &apos;s success in moving forward as a modern democracy will depend , of course , on many factors , most of them internal to Turkey and having to do with domestic leadership and decisions that political and economic actors will make in Turkey . 
But the terrorists who struck with such deadliness understand the global , not just regional , nature of the struggle for Turkey &apos;s soul . 
External factors will be critical in determining where Turkey ends up . 
Indeed , the single most important factor , which will have a decisive impact on developments to come and could set the stage for a remarkable success story , or , on the contrary , lead to failure , is the European Union &apos;s forthcoming decision on whether or not to start negotiations towards Turkey &apos;s full EU membership in 2005 . 
In December of 2002 , EU leaders committed the Union to start negotiations with Turkey on full membership , provided Turkey fulfilled the relevant criteria common to all candidate countries . 
A December 2004 summit , to take place under a Dutch chairmanship , is to see the EU review Turkey &apos;s progress and decide , provided the criteria are met , on whether to start negotiations &quot; without delay . &quot; 
Economically , politically , institutionally , Turkey needs the &quot; anchor &quot; of the European integration process . 
Europe and Turkey together must prove to themselves , and to the world , that Huntington &apos;s &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; is not unavoidable ; that Christians , Jews , Moslems , and other believers and non-believers can build the &quot; European Project &quot; together ; that a society with a large majority of Moslems , can be democratic and secular ; and that Turks and Greeks can do what the French and Germans have done : overcome a century-long antagonism to build a &quot; good neighborhood . &quot; 
The &quot; borders &quot; between East and West that Ataturk largely abolished in Turkey must not be allowed to form again in the minds of a new generation . 
The situation here is not unlike that which the EU faced in Eastern Europe , a region which also needed an &quot; anchor &quot; after the fall of communism . 
The EU provided that anchor almost without hesitation and the result has been spectacular . 
Countries with command economies and scant experience of democracy are about to become full members of the Union , after a decade of rapid transformation . 
The anchor was there from the beginning . 
Europe was decisive and generous , and it worked . 
In 1990 , Turkey had a more advanced market economy and a much greater experience with democracy than the Eastern European countries about to join the EU . 
But , in the case of Turkey , Europe has long been reluctant to provide the same sort of incentives and hopes . 
This has hurt Turkey &apos;s progress . 
But when Europe did move more decisively , as it did at the Copenhagen summit in 2002 , economic and political progress in Turkey accelerated in a very tangible way . 
Turkey must , of course , fulfill the conditions common to all candidate countries , measured in a fair and reasonable manner . 
But if it does fulfill these conditions , further hesitation by Europe will undermine all those who want to bring Turkey &apos;s democratic transition to a successful conclusion . 
No doubt the challenge for Europe of integrating a large Turkey , bordering on the Middle East , is great . 
The rewards of success , however , would be immense  -  for Turkey , for Europe , and for the world . 
Few moments in history hold the promise of the EU summit of December 2004 . 
A year remains before us . 
Turkey must work hard to get ready . 
The Unites States must think long-term and gently support the process , instead of toying with the misconceived notion of Turkey as part of a new &quot; greater Middle East . &quot; 
Most importantly , European statesmen , who know in their hearts what is required , must show the courage and the wisdom to lead .
