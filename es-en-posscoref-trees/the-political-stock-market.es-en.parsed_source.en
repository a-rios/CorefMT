The Political Stock Market 
Many economic and financial analysts complain that emerging countries &apos; stock markets are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political than economic . 
The unstated assumption seems to be that , in contrast , some pristine force of economic nature drives stock markets in advanced countries , and that forecasting their performance is thus like forecasting the growth of trees . 
This description of stock markets in emerging countries is not wrong , just biased , because the same description applies to stock markets in advanced countries . 
Indeed , the best analysts know that forecasting the performance of any country &apos;s stock market substantially means forecasting how well the government wants stock market investors to fare in the current political environment . 
Consider the United States stock market , by far the world &apos;s largest . 
The general perception is that the government leaves companies alone and that the returns from investing in the US stock market reflect the fundamental forces of a strong capitalist economy . 
This is one reason why the US is a magnet for portfolio investors from around the world . 
But the returns that make US stock markets so attractive reflect a delicate political balance . 
In particular , tax rates that affect stocks have varied through time as political pressures change . 
During World War II , for example , political support for great fortunes diminished and the government sharply increased taxes on capital gains , dividends , and high incomes in general . 
When World War II produced a strong recovery from the Great Depression of the 1930 &apos;s , President Roosevelt and Congress slapped on an excess-profits tax to ensure that shareholders would not benefit too much . 
By contrast , in 1980 , when there was no war but the stock market was low , US voters elected Ronald Reagan , a man many thought too right wing to be president . 
He asked for - and got - cuts in capital gains , dividend , and income taxes . 
Political interference in the stock market is not merely about taxes on capital gains , dividends , and income . 
Property taxes , excise taxes , import duties , and sales taxes - all of which are paid , directly or indirectly , by corporations - can have a magnified impact on corporate profits , and hence on the stock market . 
It is no coincidence that wherever stock markets thrive , governments take care that these taxes stop well short of destroying after-tax corporate profits . 
Indeed , the politics of stock markets does not stop with taxes . 
On the contrary , almost every activity of government has an impact on corporate profits , and in turn , on the stock market . 
After the 1929 stock market crash the US government suspended much anti-trust activity , allowing companies to acquire monopoly power that would boost their value . 
This policy delayed the recovery from high unemployment , but even that was not enough to rein in the political forces arrayed in favor of supporting the stock market . 
Similarly , one of the most important things that President Reagan did was to destroy much of the remaining power of America &apos;s labor unions , which compete for their share of the corporate pie . 
Reagan &apos;s defeat of the Air Traffic Controllers &apos; strike in 1981 was a watershed event for the US labor movement - and for the stock market , which started its dramatic bull market in 1982 . 
The US government has been particularly aggressive in supporting the stock market since the peak of the equities price bubble in 2000 , most notably cutting interest rates repeatedly . 
Of course , this was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy , not supporting the stock market . 
But it is a telling sign of the US stock market &apos;s significance that one of the most important factors perceived to be weighing on the economy was declining equity prices . 
Indeed , the authorities &apos; response was not limited to monetary stimulus . 
The US National Income and Product Accounts show that the effective rate of corporate profits tax ( the percentage of profits actually paid to the government in taxes ) crested at 33.7 % in the first quarter of 2000 - the peak of the stock market and the economy in general - and fell to 20.2 % in the fourth quarter of 2003 , when the market was down . 
Much of that decline reflects explicit tax relief measures voted by Congress , as well as the perception among corporations that in the current economic and political environment they can be more aggressive in tax avoidance . 
Moreover , after the stock market crash , the maximum tax on dividends paid on stocks was slashed from 35 % to 15 % , giving a substantial new advantage to long-term investors and boosting the compounding effect of reinvesting after-tax dividends . 
Again , this tax cut was justified in terms of stimulating the economy , which can , of course , be said of practically any measure aimed at supporting the stock market . 
But it is the balance of political forces that determines whether such a justification will be credible . 
One might say that the same variables , including hostility to high taxes and a weak labor movement , have operated in the US for the past 200 years - and can thus be expected to continue operating in the future , producing high stock market returns and attracting huge inflows of foreign investment . 
Those who believe that investments in the US stock market will maintain the same strong growth trend for decades may well be right . 
But one should be clear about what one is forecasting . 
Essentially , one is forecasting not just economics , but politics - and even the cultural values - that shape economic policies and performance .
