Should Scotland Leave the Pound Zone ? 
PRINCETON - As Scotland prepares for this month &apos;s referendum on independence , the United Kingdom - indeed , all of Europe - must brace itself for the impact of a successful bid . 
Scottish independence would revolutionize the British and European constitutional frameworks , and give a tremendous boost to other European separatist movements , from Catalonia to northern Italy . 
The economic impact of independence , however , is far less certain . 
Advocates of independence have long insisted that they are motivated primarily by the distinctiveness of Scottish identity . 
The more immediate issue for Scots is money . 
The question of whether an independent Scotland could or should continue to use the British pound has dominated discussions over the last few months of the referendum campaign . 
The outcome - for Scotland , the UK , and Europe - could vary widely , depending on which path Scotland chooses . 
So far , Scottish nationalists have insisted that an independent Scotland would retain the pound . 
The problem with the Scottish nationalists &quot; vision is a mirror image of the eurozone &apos;s main shortcoming . 
Given that a single currency cannot function without a common monetary policy , and that economic conditions across the currency union differ , individual members will , at times , be subject to unsuitable policies . 
For example , during the construction boom of the 2000s , Ireland and Spain should have had tighter monetary conditions , higher interest rates , and lower loan / asset ratios . 
After the financial crisis erupted , and policymakers began seeking ways to compel banks to revive lending in these and other struggling countries , it became apparent that there were no available tools to employ . 
Today , the UK faces a similar dilemma . 
The property boom in the London area demands tighter monetary conditions . 
Moreover , like Germany , London maintains a huge current-account surplus ( 8 % of GDP ) - a potentially serious problem , given the deflationary effect that Germany &apos;s surplus has had on the rest of the eurozone . 
Already , the rest of the UK runs an external deficit that is higher than that of any industrialized country . 
The behavior of a currency can be driven by one powerful and preeminent sector of the economy ; in the pound &apos;s case , it is the financial sector . 
Some viewed the pound &apos;s rapid decline in 2007 and 2008 - a 30 % depreciation in trade-weighted terms - as a much-needed economic stimulus , given the boost that it implied for export competitiveness . 
The UK &apos;s independent monetary policy provided it with a level of flexibility that the eurozone economies lacked . 
But the revival of confidence in the financial sector has caused the pound to rebound sharply ( by 18 % since the end of 2008 ) , eroding the UK &apos;s competitiveness gain . 
What is good for the City of London is not necessarily good for the rest of the economy . 
There is thus an unmistakable appeal in escaping an economic arrangement that shackles Scotland to London - an appeal that the great Scottish economist Adam Smith would have recognized . 
Indeed , his most influential work , The Wealth of Nations , was motivated by the belief that the interests of the London merchant community were distorting British commercial policy . 
The alternative to retaining the pound , however , presents its own challenges . 
According to the Scottish economist Ronald MacDonald , an independent Scotland should have its own currency , which would behave like a petro-currency , owing to the economy &apos;s dependence on North Sea gas and oil . 
But replacing one dominant sector with another is probably not good for the rest of the Scottish economy , which would lose competitiveness whenever surging energy prices pushed up the exchange rate . 
As less competitive industries were driven into loss and insolvency , economic activity would become even more concentrated and specialized . 
Placing the burden of adjustment on the exchange rate is not the answer . 
The small , open economies of Switzerland and Norway - important models for Scotland - struggled with sharp currency appreciation during the global financial crisis . 
For Switzerland , the solution was to implement a ceiling on the franc &apos;s exchange rate against the euro .
