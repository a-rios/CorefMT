Why is Rape Different ? 
NEW YORK - As Swedish prosecutors &quot; sex-crime allegations against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange play out in the international media , one convention of the coverage merits serious scrutiny . 
We know Assange by name . 
News organizations argue that the policy is motivated by respect for the alleged victims . 
In fact , despite its good intentions , providing anonymity in sex-crime cases is extremely harmful to women . 
The convention of not naming rape accusers is a relic of the Victorian period , when rape and other sex crimes were being codified and reported in ways that prefigure our own era . 
Rape was seen as &quot; the fate worse than death , &quot; rendering women - who were supposed to be virgins until marriage - &quot; damaged goods . &quot; 
Virginia Woolf called the ideal of womanhood in this period &quot; The Angel in the House &quot; : a retiring , fragile creature who could not withstand the rigors of the public arena . 
Of course , this ideal was a double-edged sword : their ostensible fragility - and their assigned role as icons of sexual purity and ignorance - was used to exclude women from influencing outcomes that affected their own destinies . 
For example , women could not fully participate under their own names in legal proceedings . 
Indeed , one of the rights for which suffragists fought was the right to be convicted of one &apos;s own crimes . 
Nonetheless , even after women gained legal rights - and even as other assumptions about women have gone the way of smelling salts and whalebone stays - the condescending Victorian convention of not identifying women who make sex-crime charges remains with us . 
That convention not only is an insult to women , but also makes rape prosecutions far more difficult . 
Overwhelmingly , anonymity serves institutions that do not want to prosecute rapists or sexual harassers . 
The United States military , for instance , hides rape accusers &quot; identities , and the prevalence of rape in the US armed forces today is off the charts . 
Maintaining anonymous charges enables the military authorities to avoid keeping comprehensive records , which in turn allows officials to evade responsibility for transparent reporting of assaults and of prosecutions - and thus not to prosecute sex crime in any serious , systematic way . 
The same is true with universities . 
My alma mater , Yale , used anonymity in reporting of sex harassment and rape to sweep sex-crime incidents and repeat offenders &quot; records under the rug for two decades , thereby protecting its own interest in preventing systematic investigation . 
Because of the prevalence of universities &quot; anonymity policy , at least two alleged serial rapists - whose assaults were reported to their employers separately by more than one victim - are teaching at new universities , with no charges ever brought against them . 
The lesson is clear : when charges are made anonymously , no one takes them as seriously as charges brought in public , resulting in institutionalized impunity for sexual predators . 
Indeed , only when victims have stood up and stated their names - granted , a difficult and often painful thing to do - have institutional change and successful prosecutions been possible . 
Anita Hill &apos;s decision in 1991 not to make anonymous accusations against Clarence Thomas , now a US Supreme Court justice , spurred a wave of enforcement of equal-employment-opportunity law . 
Hill knew that her motives would be questioned . 
In fact , the convention of anonymity merely allows rape myths to flourish . 
When victims are not kept hidden , it becomes much clearer that rape can happen to anyone - grandmothers and students , homemakers and prostitutes . 
Instead , we have stereotypes about how &quot; real &quot; rape victims must look and act in order to be taken seriously . 
Feminists have long argued that rape must be treated like any other crime . 
Treating rape so differently serves only to maintain its mischaracterization as a &quot; different &quot; kind of crime , loaded with cultural baggage and projections . 
Finally , there is a profound moral issue at stake . 
Though children &apos;s identities should , of course , be shielded in sex-crime allegations , women are not children . 
If one makes a serious criminal accusation , one must wish to be treated - and one must treat oneself - as a moral adult . 
That is why justice systems - at least in democracies - typically demand that the accused be able to face his or her accuser . 
Why , for example , in a case that is so dependent on public opinion - and on which so much depends - must Assange face allegations that may have grave consequences for him , while his accusers remain hidden ? 
So-called &quot; rape shield &quot; laws should be used to protect alleged victims . 
It is no one &apos;s business whom a victim has slept with previously , or what she was wearing when she was attacked . 
Nor should it be . 
After all , motive and context are legitimate questions in any serious criminal allegation . 
Hill , for example , knew that she would have to explain why she waited years to accuse Thomas , her former employer . 
Likewise , adult accusers of Church-protected sex criminals knew that they would have to answer fundamental questions ( notably , many of them have identified themselves , which has helped get real prosecutions ) . 
It is wrong - and sexist - to treat female sex-crime accusers as if they were children , and it is wrong to try anyone , male or female , in the court of public opinion on the basis of anonymous accusations . 
Anonymity for rape accusers is long overdue for retirement .
