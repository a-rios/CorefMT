Turkey on Trial 
ISTANBUL - In a Hollywood courtroom drama , you know that the hero , set up by the bad guys , will eventually be cleared - but not before the noose tightens around his neck . 
Just when it looks like the accumulating evidence has condemned him , a sudden turn of events will prove his innocence and expose those who framed him . 
If Turkey &apos;s ongoing political-military trials ever find their way to the screen , there will be no shortage of such denouements . 
In a series of bizarre prosecutions , Turkish courts have jailed hundreds of defendants - military officers , journalists , academics , and lawyers - for allegedly plotting to topple the country &apos;s democratically elected government . 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan promotes the trials as evidence of Turkey &apos;s new turn towards democracy and the rule of law . 
They are also actively supported by news media belonging to the so-called Gülen group - a powerful ally of Erdoğan &apos;s government made up of followers of the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen . 
In reality , the trials amount to a grave breach of the rule of law , with the judiciary transformed into a political weapon aimed at opponents of the government and the Gülen movement . 
The cases are comical - or would be if they were not really happening in a country of 74 million people whose strategic importance is difficult to overstate . 
In fact , the prosecutions are riddled with such fantastic claims , imaginary conspiracies , outlandish fabrications , obvious set-ups , and credulity-straining plot twists that a Hollywood screenwriter who included them in a script might well be laughed out of the business . 
Consider the &quot; Sledgehammer &quot; case . 
More than 200 military officers are charged with plotting a coup in 2003 to dislodge the then newly elected government . 
The prosecutors have what looks like solid evidence : detailed plans , ostensibly authored by the defendants , describing a series of ghastly operations to destabilize the country . 
The officers proclaim their innocence and assert that the coup documents are fabricated , but who is to believe them , given what the prosecutors , government , and major media say ? 
The trial has already had more than its share of movie-ending moments . 
Several defendants have shown that they were outside the country and had no access to the computers on which they supposedly authored the plans . 
Others appear to have misspelled their own names or gotten their titles wrong . 
Two forensic reports have established that the handwriting on the incriminating CD was forged . 
Perhaps most dramatically of all , the coup documents contain much information that could not possibly have been known at the time , including references to companies , NGOs , hospitals , and many other entities that were established years after the plan is supposed to have been hatched . 
Imagine the courtroom scene . 
The defense lawyer points to the key piece of evidence and addresses the prosecutor : &quot; You , sir , claim that this CD containing all the incriminating documents was prepared by my client in 2003 . 
Can you explain how my client could have known the names of officers on a frigate that joined the Navy only in 2005 ? 
Or the license plate on a vehicle that was issued in 2006 ? &quot; 
The judge turns towards the prosecutor expectantly . 
Sweating profusely , the prosecutor has nothing to say . 
The judge brings down his gavel with a loud thump . 
The case is dismissed . 
Or consider the case of a group of young officers charged with organizing a prostitution ring and stealing state secrets . 
The charges again rest on electronic files , supposedly found in the defendants &quot; homes . 
But the police made an elementary error that revealed the set-up : after supposedly receiving an anonymous tip about Ahmet A. ( a pseudonym ) , they mistakenly searched Ahmet B. &quot; s home - and yet somehow found the incriminating files among B. &quot; s possessions . 
Ahmet B. was eventually released ( after nine months ) , but the case still goes on . 
Similar examples abound in other cases . 
A prosecutor questions a suspect about a plan to intimidate Christians before the police have actually &quot; discovered &quot; it . 
A journalist is jailed because his notes for an unfinished manuscript on the Gülen movement are construed as instructions from a terrorist organization . 
A senior police officer who has written an exposé detailing Gülenist prosecutors &quot; misdeeds is jailed after police find illegal recordings of intercepted calls in his office - which he had vacated days earlier . 
Vindication comes quickly in Hollywood movies , but not in Turkey , whose courts have so far seemed oblivious to the glaring problems with evidence presented by police and prosecutors . 
Ludicrous cases proceed , and more people are being dragged into them . 
The mainstream independent media do not even report the inconsistencies for fear of provoking the government or the Gülen network . 
These cases will eventually collapse under the weight of their collective absurdity . 
But the damage done will extend far beyond the suffering of hundreds of innocent individuals who have been locked up under false pretenses . 
The hope that Turkey is finally shedding its authoritarian vestiges and becoming a stable democracy will lie in tatters .
