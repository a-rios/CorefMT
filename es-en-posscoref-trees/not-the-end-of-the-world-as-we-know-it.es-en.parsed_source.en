Not the End of the World as We Know It 
CAMBRIDGE : &quot; Reports of my demise are greatly exaggerated , &quot; Mark Twain once quipped . 
Yes , things have become tougher - from high tech to financial markets - but it is just that . 
What &apos;s is happening is not even a recession ; definitely not the end of the world . 
Recent Gallup polls report that Americans are no longer feeling exuberant , but certainly still feel comfortable . 
As to their satisfaction with America &apos;s quality of life , 33 % said they were very satisfied and another 56 % somewhat satisfied . 
Economic conditions in the country were found good or excellent by 67 % of respondents ; 63 % judged that they would be better off a year from now ; 73 % reported that they were unworried about losing their job . 
They are right . 
Unemployment will rise to 5 % at most . 
Six months from now the economy will be out of the doldrums . 
After a 5 year boom with over 4 % growth , the US economy has slowed to almost zero . 
The impetus for this slowdown was , as always , the Federal Reserve . 
No period of expansion in the US has ever just fizzled out . 
They all were killed by the Fed , and for the same reason : fear of inflation . 
The Fed acted preemptively while inflation was still very low . 
As a result the cure can afford to be much milder - a moderate rise in unemployment and a brief pause in growth rather than a full blown recession with massive increases in joblessness . 
So far , that plan is on schedule . 
True , the disappearance of growth is abrupt and more drastic than a soft landing ; the carnage in high tech is pretty awful . 
For a moment there was real fear of a real recession . 
But all that is giving way to the question of what comes next . 
The answer , obviously , is recovery and expansion . 
Inflation is in check . 
It is time to work on the upswing . 
Nothing is fundamentally wrong with America &apos;s economy ; nothing , at least , to which a recession is the answer . 
Overheating and the risk of inflation were at issue ; both have been attended to by two slow quarters already , and perhaps two more to come . 
So its time to think about where and when the upswing will arise . 
With inflation abated , monetary policy is free to reduce the cost of capital and renew the consumer spending spree as well as financial stability . 
Fiscal policy has a lot of freedom , as record surpluses cry out for tax cuts . 
Yes , 71 % of Gallup respondents feel they pay too much in taxes ; they can &apos;t wait for their rebate checks and are set to go shopping . 
Monetary and fiscal policy work in America ; they have gotten the country out of every recession . 
They certainly can overcome this growth pause . 
Of course , there are risks to this rosy scenario . 
Downward adjustments in profit expectations for corporations and hence for stocks may not reverse quickly ; consumer confidence may decline another notch . 
But that is unlikely to be the source of trouble . 
The real problem is more likely to be too vigorous an upswing . 
The Fed is under pressure to make good for a growth slump that turned out to be bigger than expected . 
The Treasury , on the other hand , is under pressure to produce tax cuts that have bipartisan support , which means putting money into the pockets of people who go out and spend , here and now . 
With so much pressure , how can policy makers avoid stepping on the accelerator just a bit too hard ? 
This is America &apos;s real problem now - too little gas is the way to a meltdown , too much propels the economy beyond full employment . 
The Fed &apos;s dilemma results form the long lag that occurs before monetary policy takes effect - nine months or so - which means that the Fed must front-load its action before it gets to see what the Treasury does . 
The Treasury will act under the pressure of today &apos;s slackness , before the Fed &apos;s injection of stimulus take effect . 
This runs the danger of overdoing it . 
Don &apos;t forget , the US economy today is at full employment and any boost to growth beyond 3 % is too much . 
Some observers will feel that this discussion misses the point : how can the US keep spending itself out of trouble ? 
With tax cuts encouraging households to spend even more and interest cuts underwriting aggressively priced stocks , the house of cards , they say , is overdue for a fall . 
But no , don &apos;t wait for collapse - not in stocks , not in confidence , not in credit . 
The US economy is fundamentally sound : everybody works , there is plenty of cost cutting and innovation , and there is plenty of investor support . 
That includes support from outside , because surely nobody can imagine that Japan or Europe offers a more dynamic economy with better potential . 
But imagine this is all wrong and a collapse does occur ? 
Be careful with the Schadenfreude . 
If the America &apos;s problem is not a pothole but an abyss , the whole world is bound to fall into it . 
We all have a great interest in America &apos;s turning around , sound and soon .
