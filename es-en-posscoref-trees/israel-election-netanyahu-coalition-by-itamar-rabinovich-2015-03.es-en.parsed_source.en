Bibi &apos;s Big Surprise 
NEW YORK - Binyamin Netanyahu proved the pollsters wrong - not once , but twice . 
In the weeks and days leading up to Israel &apos;s election , his defeat was widely predicted . 
Then , in the hours after the vote , exit polls suggested parity between his Likud party and the center-left Zionist Union , led by his chief rival , Yitzhak Herzog , with a slight edge for the right-wing bloc . 
Several hours after the polls closed , it turned out that Likud was the big winner , gaining 30 of the Knesset &apos;s 120 seats , compared to 24 for the Zionist Union . 
As a result , Netanyahu will have no real difficulty in forming a right-wing government coalition . 
The kingmakers in the event of parity - the smaller parties and electoral lists in the center of the political spectrum - have lost most of their bargaining power . 
It was a crucial election in two respects : The outcome reflected the Israeli electorate &apos;s sharp turn to the right and has reinforced Netanyahu &apos;s political dominance . 
As recently as 2006 , Ehud Olmert had won an election in Israel on a dovish platform , pledging to extend Ariel Sharon &apos;s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza to the West Bank . 
In the 2009 election , the Kadima party , under his successor , Tzipi Livni , received one seat more than Likud , but was unable to form a government coalition . 
Netanyahu did , and went on to win the 2013 election . 
Now he has won yet again . 
The turn to the right derives from both structural and circumstantial factors . 
Israel &apos;s right-wing parties draw support from the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox communities , West Bank settlers , and a large part of the Sephardic and Russian communities . 
When the center left won elections in the past two decades , it did so under a powerful security-oriented leader : Yitzhak Rabin , Ehud Barak , Sharon ( after his conversion ) , and Sharon &apos;s successor , Olmert . 
Though Herzog and Livni - who formed the Zionist Union by merging Herzog &apos;s Labor party and Livni &apos;s Hatnuah party - possess several attractive qualities , they do not match the prototype preferred by today &apos;s average voter . 
These structural elements have been reinforced by developments in the region , which have reinforced the sense among Israeli voters that they are threatened by numerous enemies : Iran and its nuclear ambitions ; 
Hezbollah and Hamas and their missiles ; the rise of ISIS amid state failure in Iraq , Syria , and elsewhere . 
Against this backdrop , it is easier to defend the status quo than to advocate accommodation involving territorial concessions . 
Netanyahu &apos;s victory was clearly an impressive personal comeback . 
In the weeks leading up to the elections , it seemed that the public had grown weary of a prime minister who had been in office long enough to be corrupted by the arrogance of power and tainted by a raft of petty scandals . 
He conducted a campaign that relied on his eloquence and charisma , as well as on scare tactics . 
Most significantly , he swung sharply to the right , out-flanking his rivals . 
Thus , two days prior to the election , he rescinded his formal acceptance , in 2009 , of a two-state solution , vowing that his government would never allow Palestinian statehood . 
The formation of a right-wing government will have a profound impact on the country &apos;s foreign and domestic policies . 
Netanyahu has already destroyed his relationship with US President Barack Obama , and Israel &apos;s relationship with the European Union is not much better . 
A government that continues to settle the West Bank and refuses to negotiate with the Palestinians will face erosion of its international legitimacy , boycotts , and sanctions . 
Relations with Egypt and Jordan will also be affected , and hopes of collaboration with the moderate Arab camp will be frustrated . 
On the home front , attempts by Likud and its right-wing allies to tamper with the legal system , the press , and other institutions identified with the &quot; old elite &quot; are likely to gain momentum . 
Netanyahu knows how risky this course will be at home and abroad , which is why he is likely to invite Herzog to join the government as a junior partner . 
Herzog would then confront the same dilemma that his predecessors faced in 2009 and 2013 . 
The arguments for and against joining the government are well known . 
Doing so is the responsible thing to do , offering the opportunity to moderate the government &apos;s policies and reduce the danger of a disaster . 
But , as Livni and Barak know , a junior partner more often ends up having no real impact on the core issues , merely providing window dressing for the status quo . 
Nor are Herzog and Livni free to make that choice on their own . 
Some party members are eager for cabinet portfolios and the other trappings of power ; but many more would rather stay out and fight . 
When Netanyahu traveled to Washington , DC , to deliver his controversial speech on Iran to the US Congress , he was described by his American supporters as &quot; Churchillian , &quot; the lonely courageous voice warning a complacent world against an evil force . 
One can only hope that now Netanyahu will be Churchillian in a more profound sense , by using his empowered position to make the bold decisions needed to lead his country out of its current predicament and paralysis .
