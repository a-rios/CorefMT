Public Health versus Private Freedom ? 
PRINCETON - In contrasting decisions last month , a United States Court of Appeals struck down a US Food and Drug Administration requirement that cigarettes be sold in packs with graphic health warnings , while Australia &apos;s highest court upheld a law that goes much further . 
The Australian law requires not only health warnings and images of the physical damage that smoking causes , but also that the packs themselves be plain , with brand names in small generic type , no logos , and no color other than a drab olive-brown . 
The US decision was based on America &apos;s constitutional protection of free speech . 
The court accepted that the government may require factually accurate health warnings , but the majority , in a split decision , said that it could not go as far as requiring images . 
In Australia , the issue was whether the law implied uncompensated expropriation - in this case , of the tobacco companies &quot; intellectual property in their brands . 
The High Court ruled that it did not . 
Underlying these differences , however , is the larger issue : who decides the proper balance between public health and freedom of expression ? 
In the US , courts make that decision , essentially by interpreting a 225-year-old text , and if that deprives the government of some techniques that might reduce the death toll from cigarettes - currently estimated at 443,000 Americans every year - so be it . 
In Australia , where freedom of expression is not given explicit constitutional protection , courts are much more likely to respect the right of democratically elected governments to strike the proper balance . 
There is widespread agreement that governments ought to prohibit the sale of at least some dangerous products . 
Countless food additives are either banned or permitted only in limited quantities , as are children &apos;s toys painted with substances that could be harmful if ingested . 
New York City has banned trans fats from restaurants and is now limiting the permitted serving size of sugary drinks . 
Many countries prohibit the sale of unsafe tools , such as power saws without safety guards . 
Although there are arguments for prohibiting a variety of different dangerous products , cigarettes are unique , because no other product , legal or illegal , comes close to killing the same number of people - more than traffic accidents , malaria , and AIDS combined . 
Cigarettes are also highly addictive . 
Moreover , wherever health-care costs are paid by everyone - including the US , with its public health-care programs for the poor and the elderly - everyone pays the cost of efforts to treat the diseases caused by cigarettes . 
Whether to prohibit cigarettes altogether is another question , because doing so would no doubt create a new revenue source for organized crime . 
It seems odd , however , to hold that the state may , in principle , prohibit the sale of a product , but may not permit it to be sold only in packs that carry graphic images of the damage it causes to human health . 
The tobacco industry will now take its battle against Australia &apos;s legislation to the World Trade Organization . 
The industry fears that the law could be copied in much larger markets , like India and China . 
That is , after all , where such legislation is most needed . 
Indeed , only about 15 % of Australians and 20 % of Americans smoke , but in 14 low and middle-income countries covered in a survey recently published in The Lancet , an average of 41 % of men smoked , with an increasing number of young women taking up the habit . 
The World Health Organization estimates that about 100 million people died from smoking in the twentieth century , but smoking will kill up to one billion people in the twenty-first century . 
Discussions of how far the state may go in promoting the health of its population often start with John Stuart Mill &apos;s principle of limiting the state &apos;s coercive power to acts that prevent harm to others . 
Mill could have accepted requirements for health warnings on cigarette packs , and even graphic photos of diseased lungs if that helps people to understand the choice that they are making ; but he would have rejected a ban . 
Mill &apos;s defense of individual liberty , however , assumes that individuals are the best judges and guardians of their own interests - an idea that today verges on naivet√© . 
The development of modern advertising techniques marks an important difference between Mill &apos;s era and ours . 
Corporations have learned how to sell us unhealthy products by appealing to our unconscious desires for status , attractiveness , and social acceptance . 
As a result , we find ourselves drawn to a product without quite knowing why . 
And cigarette makers have learned how to manipulate the properties of their product to make it maximally addictive . 
Graphic images of the damage that smoking causes can counter-balance the power of these appeals to the unconscious , thereby facilitating more deliberative decision-making and making it easier for people to stick to a resolution to quit smoking . 
Instead of rejecting such laws as restricting freedom , therefore , we should defend them as ways to level the playing field between individuals and giant corporations that make no pretense of appealing to our capacities for reasoning and reflection . 
Requiring that cigarettes be sold in plain packs with health warnings and graphic images is equal-opportunity legislation for the rational beings inside us .
