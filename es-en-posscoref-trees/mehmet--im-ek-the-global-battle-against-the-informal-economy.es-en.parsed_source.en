Economic Shadows and Light 
ANKARA - If it is true that we live in a &quot; global village , &quot; bound to one another through commercial , financial , and social ties , then it is also true that informal economic activity in one part of the world has a negative impact elsewhere . 
That means that formalizing every economy should be viewed as a global public good . 
The G-20 and other international entities should take the lead in ensuring the coordination and cooperation needed to provide it . 
The biggest losers of the informal economy are ordinary citizens , because informality inhibits long-term economic growth and productivity gains ; creates unfair competition ; hinders the growth of small and medium-size enterprises ( the main sources of employment ) ; and leaves millions of workers without basic rights , such as health insurance and pensions . 
It also leads to significant tax-revenue losses , reducing both the quality and quantity of public services . 
Income inequality and social injustice invariably increase as well . 
Reducing the scope of the formal economy may seem to be a national task ; and governments should indeed act . 
They should reduce the tax burden , simplify tax systems , and reduce regulatory compliance costs , while strengthening enforcement . 
Likewise , they should eliminate barriers to competition , simplify business registration processes , increase the transparency of public procurement , and improve access to credit . 
But combating the informal economy requires international cooperation as well . 
According to the European Commission , &quot; non-cooperative &quot; and &quot; non-transparent &quot; jurisdictions - also known as tax havens - cost the European Union &apos;s member states more than $ 1 trillion in revenue every year . 
Controlling and decreasing the risks that these jurisdictions pose can happen only at the global level . 
Here the OECD and G-20 can play an important role . 
The OECD already provides vital support in promoting international cooperation on taxation . 
Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital regulates the content and practice of bilateral exchanges of tax information , which are crucial to fighting tax avoidance and evasion and combating harmful tax competition . 
Similarly , the OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes is leading an extensive peer-review process of legal frameworks and implementation of standards . 
The OECD recently issued an Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ( BEPS ) that identifies specific measures to combat double non-taxation and to establish comprehensive and transparent standards of fair taxation . 
The focus of G-20 summits on global tax evasion in recent years is also encouraging . 
When the G-20 leaders convened in Los Cabos , Mexico , in June 2012 , they reiterated their commitment to strengthen transparency and comprehensive exchange of tax information . 
They also reiterated the need to prevent BEPS . 
Moreover , the G-20 has launched efforts to encourage all jurisdictions to sign the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters , developed jointly by the Council of Europe and the OECD . 
But more must be done to combat the informal economy . 
I can easily imagine bilateral agreements - and then a multilateral arrangement - that establishes a unique global tax ID for all taxpayers . 
In Turkey , a comprehensive plan to reduce the scope of the informal economy involves 14 major public institutions , including the Ministry of Finance . 
Proactive tax-collection mechanisms to improve voluntary tax compliance have been put in place . 
For example , a system developed for landlords has helped to double the number of taxpayers reporting rental income . 
Turkey has also improved regulatory enforcement , created a more effective Tax Audit Board , and invested in human capital and technology . 
Macroeconomic reforms have also helped to curtail Turkey &apos;s shadow economy . 
In 2006 , the corporate-tax rate was lowered from 33 % to 20 % , and rates for personal-income tax were also reduced , with the highest rate falling from 49.5 % to 35 % , and the lowest rate to 15 % , from 22 % . 
Moreover , in 2008 , the income-tax burden on minimum-wage earners was set at a low of 0 % , depending on marital status and number of children . 
Further , the rate for value-added tax on health , education , clothing , and tourism was cut from 18 % to 8 % , while the VAT on major food items is now 1 % . 
Last but not least , Turkey &apos;s authorities have implemented major reforms aimed at improving the business environment . 
These include a new commercial code and debt legislation . 
A new income-tax law is currently under parliamentary consideration , and a law on tax procedures will be submitted soon . 
Turkish policymakers have also focused on international cooperation and coordination in creating a level playing field globally . 
Turkey now has double-taxation agreements with 82 countries and information-exchange agreements with five countries . 
As a result of these efforts , informal employment in Turkey has declined by 14.5 percentage points since 2002 , to 37.6 % in April 2013 . 
Likewise , the informal economy as a share of GDP declined by six percentage points during this period , to 26.5 % in 2013 . 
But these ratios remain too high . 
The authorities &quot; medium-term objective is to reduce the informal economy &apos;s GDP share by five more percentage points and to reduce informal employment in non-agricultural sectors by five percentage points as well . 
Determined efforts such as these are indispensable to dispelling the shadows in which informal economic activity exists . 
But national policymakers cannot hold the light alone . Read more from &quot; 2013 : Reversing Gears &quot; here , or on Kindle and iBooks .
