Inflation Is Still the Lesser Evil 
CAMBRIDGE - The world &apos;s major central banks continue to express concern about inflationary spillover from their recession-fighting efforts . 
That is a mistake . 
Weighed against the political , social , and economic risks of continued slow growth after a once-in-a-century financial crisis , a sustained burst of moderate inflation is not something to worry about . 
On the contrary , in most regions , it should be embraced . 
Perhaps the case for moderate inflation ( say , 4-6 % annually ) is not so compelling as it was at the outset of the crisis , when I first raised the issue . 
Back then , against a backdrop of government reluctance to force debt write-downs , along with massively over-valued real housing prices and excessive real wages in some sectors , moderate inflation would have been extremely helpful . 
The consensus at the time , of course , was that a robust &quot; V-shaped &quot; recovery was around the corner , and it was foolish to embrace inflation heterodoxy . 
I thought otherwise , based on research underlying my 2009 book with Carmen M. Reinhart , This Time is Different . 
Examining previous deep financial crises , there was every reason to be concerned that the employment decline would be catastrophically deep and the recovery extraordinarily slow . 
A proper assessment of the medium-term risks would have helped to justify my conclusion in December 2008 that &quot; It will take every tool in the box to fix today &apos;s once-in-a-century financial crisis . &quot; 
Five years on , public , private , and external debt are at record levels in many countries . 
There is still a need for huge relative wage adjustments between Europe &apos;s periphery and its core . 
But the world &apos;s major central banks seem not to have noticed . 
In the United States , the Federal Reserve has sent bond markets into a tizzy by signaling that quantitative easing ( QE ) might be coming to an end . 
The proposed exit seems to reflect a truce accord among the Fed &apos;s hawks and doves . 
The doves got massive liquidity , but , with the economy now strengthening , the hawks are insisting on bringing QE to an end . 
This is a modern-day variant of the classic prescription to start tightening before inflation sets in too deeply , even if employment has not fully recovered . 
As William McChesney Martin , who served as Fed Chairman in the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s , once quipped , the central bank &apos;s job is &quot; to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going . &quot; 
The trouble is that this is no ordinary recession , and a lot people have not had any punch yet , let alone too much . 
Yes , there are legitimate technical concerns that QE is distorting asset prices , but bursting bubbles simply are not the main risk now . 
Right now is the US &apos;s best chance yet for a real , sustained recovery from the financial crisis . 
And it would be a catastrophe if the recovery were derailed by excessive devotion to anti-inflation shibboleths , much as some central banks were excessively devoted to the gold standard during the 1920 &quot; s and 1930 &quot; s . 
Japan faces a different conundrum . 
Haruhiko Kuroda , the Bank of Japan &apos;s new governor , has sent a clear signal to markets that the BOJ is targeting 2 % annual inflation , after years of near-zero price growth . 
But , with longer-term interest rates now creeping up slightly , the BOJ seems to be pausing . 
What did Kuroda and his colleagues expect ? 
If the BOJ were to succeed in raising inflation expectations , long-term interest rates would necessarily have to reflect a correspondingly higher inflation premium . 
As long as nominal interest rates are rising because of inflation expectations , the increase is part of the solution , not part of the problem . 
The BOJ would be right to worry , of course , if interest rates were rising because of a growing risk premium , rather than because of higher inflation expectations . 
The risk premium could rise , for example , if investors became uncertain about whether Kuroda would adhere to his commitment . 
The solution , as always with monetary policy , is a clear , consistent , and unambiguous communication strategy . 
The European Central Bank is in a different place entirely . 
Because the ECB has already been using its balance sheet to help bring down borrowing costs in the eurozone &apos;s periphery , it has been cautious in its approach to monetary easing . 
But higher inflation would help to accelerate desperately needed adjustment in Europe &apos;s commercial banks , where many loans remain on the books at far above market value . 
It would also provide a backdrop against which wages in Germany could rise without necessarily having to fall in the periphery . 
Each of the world &apos;s major central banks can make plausible arguments for caution . 
And central bankers are right to insist on structural reforms and credible plans for balancing budgets in the long term . 
But , unfortunately , we are nowhere near the point at which policymakers should be getting cold feet about inflation risks . 
They should be spiking the punch bowl more , not taking it away .
