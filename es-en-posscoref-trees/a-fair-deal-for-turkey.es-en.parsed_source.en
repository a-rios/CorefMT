A Fair Deal for Turkey 
Turkey has been given what looks like an ultimatum from the EU Commission : open your ports for ships from Cyprus within a month , or you may risk a halt to the EU accession talks now underway . 
At the same time , the Commission &apos;s latest report on Turkey &apos;s progress toward accession notes that political reforms have slowed down , further calling into question the country &apos;s future EU membership . 
At that meeting , European leaders should ask themselves the following questions : Has the EU given Turkey a fair deal in the case of Cyprus ? 
Has the EU &apos;s behavior been consistent in supporting political reform in Turkey ? 
What are the EU &apos;s long-term interests vis-Ã -vis Turkey ? 
If the answers to the first two questions are &quot; no &quot; - as I believe they are - the third question becomes vitally important . 
True , Turkey has closed its ports to ships from ( Greek ) Cyprus , and this is a violation of agreements . 
This is because Cyprus remains a divided island . 
It was assumed that Cyprus should be united when the country joined the EU in 2004 . 
A United Nations plan for unification was accepted by the Turkish part . 
But the Greek Cypriots voted against the plan because their leaders did not live up to the implicit deal with the EU to support it . 
Nevertheless , Cyprus became an EU member - but only the Greek part . 
This was clearly a mistake , because it made the EU part of the conflict . 
So how can Turkey under these conditions maintain confidence in the EU &apos;s fairness ? 
Political and legal reforms in Turkey in recent years have been remarkably far-reaching , for they have clearly been spurred by Turks &quot; wish to move closer to the EU . 
But Turkish public support for EU membership has fallen dramatically as Turks have grown to feel that they are not being given a fair deal . 
This has given new strength to those who want Turkey to develop in another direction , towards a more Islamic society instead of a modern secular state . 
Therefore , the recent lack of progress in Turkey &apos;s reform process can to a large extent be explained by the EU &apos;s behavior . 
This leaves us with the third question : what kind of Turkey does the EU want ? 
There should be no doubt about the answer : it is clearly in the EU &apos;s interest to see Turkey &apos;s democracy and economy continue to strengthen . 
More than 40 years ago , it was promised that once Turkey lives up to the preconditions for membership , it will be welcome in the EU . 
It is high time that European leaders take this promise seriously . 
It is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the EU are against Turkish membership . 
But they are reacting to the current situation . 
When they are asked if they would like a reformed Turkey as a partner - a Turkey that lives up fully to the conditions for membership described in the Copenhagen Criteria ( democracy , rule of law , respect for human rights , and an effective market economy ) - many more are inclined to say yes . 
European leaders must therefore take up two challenges . 
First , they should say clearly to their own voters that the EU must live up to its promises to Turkey , and that this is in the larger interest of all Europeans . 
Second , they should give Turkey a fair deal in the negotiations . 
The first litmus test on European leadership concerns the practical problem of access to harbors . 
Here the Finns , who chair the EU right now , have taken an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes into consideration both sides in the conflict . 
The Finnish initiative should be given strong support from all European leaders . 
At the same time , a new effort should be made to bring life to the UN &apos;s proposals regarding Cyprus . 
If this means putting pressure on some actors within the EU &apos;s own ranks , so be it .
