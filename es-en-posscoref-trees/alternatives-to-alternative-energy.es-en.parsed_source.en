Alternatives to Alternative Energy 
VIRGINIA BEACH - The problem of long-term energy sources has been drifting towards crisis for decades . 
Indeed , the catastrophes in Japan might finally achieve what decades of conflict in the Middle East have not : compel governments to invest in the research required to develop viable energy alternatives . 
The immediate political response to the Japanese disaster will be to make small re-adjustments among known energy sources , including wind and solar . 
But the current options that many governments wish to embrace will not do the job . 
Production of the materials used to capture and store solar electricity , for example , can cause just as much environmental damage as conventional fuels , and existing wind and solar technology cannot easily meet the needs of large populations . 
Of course , fossil fuels , mainly coal and natural gas , remain important , but their extraction and use is tied to groundwater pollution and carbon-dioxide emissions , especially in North America and China . 
The tragedy in Japan reminds us that , though nuclear energy emits no CO2 , it is toxic in other ways . 
If there was ever a time for a massive investment in research into long-term energy sources , that time is now . 
We need something on the scale of the Manhattan Project ( which created the atomic bomb ) , or the Apollo Program ( which put a man on the moon ) . 
Both initiatives succeeded in a short period of time and at a relatively low price . 
In current dollars , each cost about $ 200 billion - a mere fraction of what the United States has paid for the Iraq war , and less than the cost implied by the rise in oil prices over the past year . 
Both the Apollo Program and the Manhattan Project had unique characteristics . 
Each marshaled the sharpest minds from a range of countries to address one task . 
Tolerance for failure was slim in both initiatives , so they tended to rely on the previous generation of scientific insight , because the resulting technology was more trustworthy . 
Neither entailed a great scientific challenge , but rather a vast engineering problem . 
Although invention was required , existing scientific methods were used . 
Unfortunately , governments now focus only on one aspect of this investment format , in which technology that is almost ready is funded . 
But this results in endless efforts to make non-ideal methods less troublesome . 
We need a game changer , like the integrated circuit , radio , or electricity . 
Such a paradigm shift requires an Apollo-scale investment , but in basic science . 
There are several examples of the kind of phenomena that , with the benefit of new insight , could lead to unexpected energy sources . 
Quite apart from daily sunlight , for instance , Earth is bombarded by all sorts of other radiation from outside our solar system . 
Some of this we understand , but most of the material in the universe , and the forces associated with it , are not well explained . 
There is most likely an exploitable galactic source of energy that is constant , unlimited , and in our sky right now . 
Without basic research to help us understand these forces , their potential will elude us . 
An even more mysterious effect occurs on Earth with living creatures . 
According to general laws of physics , everything tends to disorder - a process known as entropy . 
Less well understood is why some agents do the opposite , tending toward order and structure . 
Plants , for example , interact with their environment to produce locally ordered systems , resulting in the creation of wood ( and other biomass ) . 
When we burn wood , we reverse the process , unraveling that order and producing energy . 
At this simple level , we understand how nature works . 
But in more complex cases , in which living beings collaborate to build societies or create knowledge , our scientific models are inadequate . 
This has prompted some scientists to begin investigating new models of energy from the perspective of &quot; intelligence and information , &quot; in which order is equivalent to information . 
With such a fresh perspective on matter , new potentials could emerge . 
For example , consider methane clathrate , an ice-like stone that in most cases is built in an ordered way by a complex collaboration of microbes . 
Global deposits of methane clathrate contain more than twice the amount of energy of all known fossil fuels , and it can burn cleanly . 
If not burned in a controlled way , the release of raw clathrates into the atmosphere would represent a global climate threat , and past massive releases have been catastrophic . 
But a better understanding of biological &quot; information flow &quot; could help us use methane clathrate in ways that could actually counter global warming . 
Solutions such as these are not explored , however , because they are not within obviously immediate reach , as the atomic bomb and the lunar landing were . 
So , perhaps a radically new approach to research is also needed . 
Given humanity &apos;s common interest in new energy sources , it seems that the world &apos;s brightest scientific minds should collaborate to identify them . 
Such a project would flourish in a scientific establishment that is maturing , rather than frozen in its methods . 
Whereas Japan , the US , and Europe are competent at research into what is almost known , the cutting-edge science is more likely to emerge in an economy hungry for resources and infrastructure , such as China . 
Rather than a single laboratory , such a program could be a distributed virtual enterprise , taking advantage of the sort of innovative industrial collaboration in which China currently excels . 
We need fundamental breakthroughs in alternative energy sources , and soon . 
Getting them will probably require a large , collaborative effort focused on theoretical science . 
Changing our approach to research in this way might seem more difficult than using what we already have . 
But , as with our natural resources , we are running out of options .
