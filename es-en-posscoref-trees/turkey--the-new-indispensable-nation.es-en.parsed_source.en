Turkey : The New Indispensable Nation 
ANKARA - Turkey put its imprint as one of the most influential countries not only on 2010 , but on the first decade of the third millennium . 
At the start of the new decade , too , Turkey &apos;s geopolitical position , rich historical heritage , cultural depth , well-educated young population , ever-strengthening democracy , growing economy , and constructive foreign policy make it an indispensable country in a world transformed by rapid globalization . 
By making use of all of its assets , Turkey is contributing to regional stability and peace and working towards a global order based on justice , equality , and transparency . 
As an emerging power , Turkey will continue to realize its own potential and simultaneously contribute to global peace . 
The chaotic conditions of the post-Cold War world have made civil wars , occupations , nuclear armament , and human trafficking chronic problems . 
While globalization offers new opportunities , it also causes new global problems and deepens the inequalities embedded in the world order . 
It is no longer possible to sustain the current world order , which , based as it is on a skewed notion of center-periphery relations , merely produces injustice and inequality . 
Turkey seeks to contribute to regional and global peace by facilitating democratic reforms domestically and implementing a principled foreign policy . 
As a NATO member , Turkey aims to become a full member of the European Union and establish cordial relations with all of its southern and eastern neighbors . 
Turkey &apos;s posture - looking both East and West - is neither paradoxical nor inconsistent . 
On the contrary , Turkey &apos;s multidimensional geopolitical position is an asset for the region . 
There are few countries that can play such a critical role . 
Turkey constitutes a new synthesis because of its ability to link such diverse qualities and backgrounds . 
Turkey is thus capable of overcoming the dichotomies of East-West , Europe-Middle East , and North-South . 
Indeed , this capacity is essential because we need to leave behind the Manichean disagreements , conflicts , and fears of the Cold War era . 
Those who see the world through those old , fearful lenses have difficulty understanding Turkey &apos;s rising profile and dynamism . 
But the realities of the twenty-first century necessitate a multi-dimensional and inclusive political perspective . 
Acting on these principles , Turkey is following a proactive foreign policy stretching from the Balkans to the Middle East and the Caucasus . 
This geography is Turkey &apos;s natural historical and cultural hinterland . 
Turkey &apos;s cultural and historical links with the peoples of these regions are deep and conducive to regional peace . 
Turkey cannot remain indifferent to this geography , for it stands at the center of it . 
History clearly shows that it is impossible to establish and sustain global peace without ensuring peace and stability in the Balkans and the Middle East . 
Turkey is following a constructive and inclusive policy for these regions , which are marked by remarkable models of cohabitation , science , arts , culture , and civilization . 
Due to our recent efforts , the wounds of the Bosnian war are being healed , facilitating peace and stability among Balkan peoples . 
Turkey &apos;s efforts are also helping to prevent wars in the Middle East , and our intense efforts have helped keep a diplomatic track open on the Iranian nuclear issue . 
Moreover , we are helping to facilitate political stability in Iraq and helping the NATO mission in Afghanistan . 
And , of paramount importance , Turkey is making enormous efforts to help establish an independent and sustainable Palestinian state - efforts that are appreciated by Turkey &apos;s Western and Eastern friends alike . 
Today , Turkey is following a policy that represents a sense of justice in the Middle East , and is working toward the removal of artificial borders and walls among the region &apos;s peoples . 
We desire to live in a region where the dignity of every person is respected . 
That is why we have objected to Israel &apos;s aggression in and blockade of Gaza , and will continue to do so . 
We know that it is not possible to attain global peace unless we establish sustainable peace in the Middle East , which requires resolving the Palestinian question . 
Therefore , we urge Israel and all other countries involved to follow constructive and peaceful policies . 
Motivated by these principles , Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and I showed through our &quot; Alliance of Civilizations Initiative &quot; in 2004 that cultural , historic , and religious differences are no reason for conflict . 
The basis for our approach to humanity is the following principle of the famous Turkish poet Yunus Emre : &quot; We love and respect the created because of the Creator . &quot; 
As a result , we stand firmly opposed to discrimination against any society , religion , sect , culture , or country . 
I consider anti-Semitism , Islamophobia , and prejudice against Christianity crimes against humanity , whose common values and ethical rules oblige us to confront and reject all forms of discrimination . 
Besides its cultural , historic , and diplomatic values , Turkey &apos;s vibrant economy has become a source of stability and welfare . 
When my party took office in 2002 , the Turkish economy totaled around $ 250 billion . 
Today , Turkey &apos;s annual GDP has reached $ 800 billion , making it Europe &apos;s sixth largest economy and the 17th largest in the world . 
It has also been one of the least impacted by the global economic crisis , with growing foreign trade , a strong banking system , and diverse and prospering small and medium-size enterprises . 
Thus , the Turkish economy returned to its pre-crisis levels in 2010 . 
All of these qualities have transformed Turkey into an attractive place for business , media , artists , diplomats , students , and non-governmental organizations from around the world . 
Turkey &apos;s ever-increasing soft power is becoming one of its most significant traits , which we will continue to use to enhance regional and global peace . 
The impact of globalization has brought about a rebalancing of power , but the demand for justice , transparency , and legitimacy remains constant . 
The global problems of our times necessitate cooperation , political will , and sacrifice . 
That is why we are following a proactive policy in multilateral institutions to facilitate an equitable sharing of our world &apos;s resources . 
Turkey will continue to work toward a just and equitable global order in 2011 and beyond . 
This is a responsibility emanating from our history , geography , and the universal values that we hold .
