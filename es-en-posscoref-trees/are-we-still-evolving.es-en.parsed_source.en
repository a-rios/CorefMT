Are We Still Evolving ? 
NEW HAVEN - Many public-policy decisions are based on implicit assumptions about &quot; human nature , &quot; and it is currently popular to speculate about how evolution might have shaped human behavior and psychology . 
But this raises some important questions : are humans continuing to evolve - and , if so , is our basic biological nature changing - or has modern culture stopped evolution ? 
For some traits , we do not have to speculate - we can measure and compare on the basis of studies covering thousands of individuals over several generations . 
Such studies have not yet been done on most of the traits where speculation is popular , but they have been done on some traits of medical interest . 
What have we learned ? 
Scientists are taking two approaches . 
In one , they sequence the DNA of particular genes in many individuals with or without some determined health condition and look for differences between the two groups . 
This genetic approach measures effects that have accumulated over hundreds to thousands of generations , and the message is clear : humans have evolved in these respects fairly recently , some in one direction , some in another , depending on their environment and other conditions encountered . 
From this approach , we have learned , for example , that the ability to digest milk as adults evolved within the last 10,000 years - and several times - in cultures that domesticated sheep , goats , or cattle . 
Similar studies have taught us that sensitivity to alcohol consumption and resistance to diseases like malaria and leprosy also evolved within the last several thousand years . 
Some scientists , myself included , have taken a different approach . 
Instead of looking for changes in genes that take many generations to accumulate until they can be detected , we have measured natural selection directly . 
This method can reveal selection in action , working over periods of time as short as one generation - so that it can answer the question of whether modern culture has stopped evolution . 
The message of this approach is also clear : natural selection continues to operate in modern cultures . 
Whether it will operate consistently enough for a long enough time to produce significant genetic change can be answered only by future generations . 
Nevertheless , it is interesting to see in what direction natural selection is starting to shape us . 
Some of the answers are surprising . 
We measured natural selection operating on women in Framingham , Massachusetts , where a long-term medical study on heart disease produced the data that we used . 
The women were born between 1892 and 1956 . 
We found significant selection and projected that if it continued for ten generations , the women would evolve to be about two centimeters shorter and have their first child about five months earlier . 
This is a surprising result , because women in developed countries have become taller thanks to better nutrition , and are having children later in life for many reasons , some of them cultural . 
So what is going on here ? 
Three things : 
First , we know that giving birth for the first time when younger carries a cost in increased infant mortality , but modern medicine and hygiene have strikingly reduced infant mortality , reducing the cost of younger age at first birth . 
We therefore expect a shift toward earlier reproduction , because the costs previously associated with doing so have disappeared - exactly what we found in Framingham . 
And we expect those younger women to be shorter simply because they have had less time to grow . 
In five other cases , scientists found women in developed countries maturing earlier , in two of them at smaller size ( in the other three cases , size was not measured ) . 
It is too early to say that this is a general trend , but right now , all signs point that way . 
Second , we measured the effects of natural selection by noting that women who were shorter and first gave birth when younger had more children . 
But genes are only one of many factors that influence height and age at first birth . 
Personal decisions , nutrition , income level , education , and religious affiliation all enter the mix . 
When we estimated how much of the variation among individuals could be attributed to biology , the answer was less than 5 % . 
But , while the effects of biology on the traits that we measured are relatively small for humans living in complex modern cultures , even small effects , when repeated consistently , will accumulate . 
Third , traits like these are always the result of interactions between genes and environment . 
A woman could have genes that would tend to make her taller than average but end up shorter than average if she had been poorly nourished as a child . 
If evolution took its steady course and changed the genetic basis of height and age at first birth , we might not see women ten generations later who were shorter and matured earlier , for the effects of nutrition and culture could more than compensate for the genetic change . 
As a colleague of mine likes to put it , one good school-lunch program could be enough to obscure the biological effects . 
Even when we focus on a simple physical trait like height , natural selection in humans turns out to be a multifaceted and nuanced process . 
Similar studies on human behavior and psychology , where causation is more complex , remain beyond our grasp . 
In such cases , silence may be wiser than speculation .
