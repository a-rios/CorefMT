The Second Coming of Zhu Rongji ? 
SHANGHAI - The recent release of a book of speeches by former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has refocused attention on his bold - and often highly controversial - economic reforms of the 1990 &quot; s , which included reining in state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) and overhauling the banking system . 
But the discussion has taken an unexpected turn , with Chinese media adopting a far less critical stance than that which has prevailed for the last two decades . 
Given the apparent parallels between the challenges that Zhu faced and those that current Premier Li Keqiang is now attempting to address , not to mention their shared commitment to economic transformation , this shift could signify rising support for structural reform . 
But are Zhu and Li really so much alike ? 
Today , as in the 1990 &quot; s , China is experiencing skyrocketing local-government and commercial-bank debt , rising fiscal and financial risk , uncertainty over institutional reform , and declining central-government revenue . 
According to Bloomberg , Li will be the first Chinese premier not to fulfill the official annual growth target since Zhu . 
Despite these apparent similarities , however , China &apos;s situation today is fundamentally different from 20 years ago . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , Zhu &apos;s core mission was to address the consequences of former Premier Zhao Ziyang &apos;s flawed fiscal-decentralization efforts . 
By pursuing fiscal reform one sector at a time , Zhao left room for local governments to form alliances with SOEs , which provided subsidies to local bodies and enabled them to withhold income from the central government . 
This led to the build-up of national public debt , which , in turn , compelled the central bank to over-issue currency , fueling inflation . 
In this context , Zhu &apos;s reform strategy was aimed primarily at reestablishing a sound fiscal relationship between the central and local governments , rather than at increasing the GDP growth rate . 
In fact , though Zhu &apos;s reforms were piecemeal , they could easily have led to double-digit GDP growth . 
But Zhu recognized that allowing such rapid growth probably would have done more harm than good , given persistent inflation and macroeconomic instability . 
Critics assert that Zhu &apos;s 1994 tax reform led to the current real-estate bubble , because it drove local governments to use land sales to boost their incomes . 
But the fact is that replacing the income-sharing system with a tax-sharing system stabilized China &apos;s economy and reversed the relative decline of central-government revenue . 
Indeed , it was essential to China &apos;s economic development . 
By weakening the alliances between local governments and SOEs , Zhu &apos;s tax-sharing system facilitated the strategic restructuring of the state-owned economy . 
And , by galvanizing local governments to privatize local SOEs ( as well as housing and some public services ) , Zhu &apos;s reform hastened China &apos;s incorporation into the global economy . 
China &apos;s state-owned economy is far less bloated today ; the central and local governments have fewer compatibility problems ; the country &apos;s fiscal position is strong ; and relative macroeconomic stability prevails . 
Zhu &apos;s success means that Li must focus on a different challenge . 
Li must ensure that China &apos;s economy , which still boasts significant growth potential , does not sink into lethargy and fall into the so-called &quot; middle-income trap . &quot; 
A developing economy may slow prematurely when external factors alter the conditions supporting growth . 
In order to avoid such an outcome , Li must adapt China &apos;s growth model to current conditions , which include intensifying trade friction with the European Union and the United States , greater pressure to allow the renminbi to appreciate , an aging population , slowing urbanization , and rising labor costs . 
The &quot; new normal &quot; that has emerged from the global financial crisis , characterized by sluggish GDP growth and diminished import demand in the West , makes reform even more urgent . 
Li should begin by redistributing industrial capital from high-productivity coastal areas . 
This would instantly augment growth in less-developed regions and boost overall productivity . 
But , with competition in the global supply chain fiercer than ever , China will need more than capital transfer to achieve high-income status . 
Fortunately , Li seems to understand this . 
Indeed , industrial and technological upgrading forms the core of &quot; Likonomics . &quot; 
But significant uncertainty remains over how to achieve it within the constraints of China &apos;s state-led economy . 
Over the last decade - especially since 2008 - China &apos;s central government has been tightening its grip on industrial policy , while enhancing the State Council &apos;s dominance over local governments . 
By contrast , Li seems intent on returning power to local governments and the market , transforming vertical control into horizontal coordination . 
Thus , instead of trying to control technological and industrial upgrading with central mandates , Li is giving local governments and the market the space to drive China &apos;s economic transformation . 
Zhu and Li do have one thing in common : they both came to power at a critical juncture in China &apos;s development . 
But , whereas Zhu had to grapple with local officials to increase the central government &apos;s authority and revenue , thereby stabilizing the economy and unleashing China &apos;s growth potential , Li must cooperate with local governments to create a system that fosters and protects new sources of innovation and economic dynamism at all levels . 
Just as Zhu &apos;s reforms two decades ago laid the foundation for today &apos;s growth , whether Li succeeds may well determine China &apos;s economic trajectory for the next 20 years .
