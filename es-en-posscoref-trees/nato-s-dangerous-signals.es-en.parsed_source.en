NATO &apos;s Dangerous Signals 
COPENHAGEN - Two dangerous signals were sent from NATO &apos;s Bucharest summit . 
The first was that Russia has reestablished a &quot; sphere of interest &quot; in Europe , where countries are no longer allowed to pursue their own goals without Moscow accepting them . 
The other was that all NATO member states are free to blackmail their partners into supporting their own narrow goals . 
The first signal was sent when Ukraine and Georgia were denied the &quot; Membership Action Plan &quot; ( MAP ) that they sought . 
Several European heavyweights , led by Germany and France , said no , despite strong support for the idea from the United States . 
The second signal was sent when Greece successfully vetoed membership for Macedonia , a move that reflected the two countries &quot; unresolved conflict over Macedonia &apos;s name ( which Greece insists must be Former Yugoslav Republic Of Macedonia - FYROM - one of the most disgraceful acronyms harassing international politics today ) . 
The dispute with Macedonia goes back to the early 1990 &quot; s , when Yugoslavia collapsed into independent states . 
Greece vehemently opposed its tiny northern neighbor - with only two million inhabitants - using the name Macedonia and symbols from the days of Alexander the Great in its flag and crest . 
Macedonia at one point agreed to design a new flag and remove the symbols , as well as to amend its constitution to clarify that it had no territorial claims on Greece , but it flatly refused to live under one of the tongue-twisting names suggested by its bigger neighbor . 
So there you are : a Greek veto on Macedonia &apos;s national aspirations until it has chosen a name that does not make the Greeks shiver in fear of aggression from the north . 
It sounds ridiculous , but there is another , often overlooked , aspect to the dispute : by behaving as it has , Greece is demonstrating a lack of confidence in its NATO partners . 
With Macedonia in NATO , any adventurous policy that undermined regional stability would certainly be stopped in its tracks . 
If the Greeks cannot see that , their partners must let them know that there is a price for their obstructive behavior . 
The problem with Ukraine and Georgia is far more serious . 
In a sense , Russia has behaved like Greece in claiming that NATO enlargement threatens its security . 
That is nonsense , and Russia knows it . 
In other words , Russia is being allowed to re-assert its &quot; sphere of influence &quot; - a concept that should have been superceded by that of &quot; Europe Whole and Free , &quot; which the entire European Union appeared to have embraced when communism collapsed . 
But no : 1989 was not the end of history . 
History threatens to return . 
European opponents of a MAP for Ukraine and Georgia argue that neither country is ready for NATO membership . 
Too many question marks about their national unity are said to exist , too many internal conflicts linger , and their records on political and judicial reforms are supposedly dubious . 
But the MAP process does not imply an automatic right to NATO membership . 
On the contrary , MAPs would put heavy demands on Ukraine and Georgia . 
Both would have to answer a lot of difficult questions and convince others that they are able to live up to NATO &apos;s democratic requirements before being allowed to join . 
Therefore , it would also be in Russia &apos;s interest to see such a process started . 
Russia has valid concerns regarding the huge Russian-speaking minorities in both countries , and these concerns are best dealt within the framework of the MAP process , where the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe &apos;s very strict rules on treatment of minorities provide the benchmark . 
Indeed , the MAP process ensured protections for Russian minorities in Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania - all ex-Soviet republics that are now NATO members . 
The crux of the matter is Europe &apos;s lack of political will to forge a unified stand toward Russia . 
This is sad - both for Russia and Europeans - because it strengthens the hand of those in Moscow who want to pursue a policy of national pride rather than national interest , and it weakens the possibilities of establishing a real common European foreign and security policy . 
But it is saddest for the countries that are once again being left out in the cold . 
NATO is supposed to be a beacon for countries struggling to establish democracy and freedom . 
The Bucharest summit suggests that the beacon has been switched off .
