Poverty , Social Spending , and IMF Programs : Myth vs. Reality 
WASHINGTON , D.C. : An oft-repeated claim is that the IMF is responsible for increasing human misery in developing countries - in particular , by forcing countries to cut spending on programs like health and education . 
But riots and repetition do not make such claims true . 
At best , such accusations are out of date ; at worst , they are ideological grandstanding . 
The record , indeed , is clear : in 66 countries with IMF programs , between 1985 and 1998 , per capita spending on health and education rose by more than 2 % per year after inflation . 
These numbers reflect the fact that IMF advice to countries facing budgetary pressures emphasizes the importance of sustaining expenditures on health and education . 
The Fund urges that savings be found in unproductive spending - meaning excessive military spending , subsidies for the well-to-do , and inefficient administrative practices . 
Indeed , military spending ( in the 41 countries where the IMF has data ) fell by almost 1 % of GDP between 1993 and 1997 . 
Low-income countries have posted larger gains in health and education spending than other countries under IMF programs . 
This difference will become even more pronounced as increasing amounts of debt relief are delivered under the Initiative for Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPCs ) , because a principal condition for this assistance is that money saved is channeled into poverty reduction . 
In the past year , 10 of the 41 eligible countries have been granted debt relief under this initiative ; we expect another 10 to start receiving debt relief by the end of this year . 
Early participants like Bolivia and Uganda are seeing their debt service payments fall by as much as 1 % of GDP , providing scope for a substantial increase in health and education spending . 
In Tanzania , next year &apos;s budget provides for a 44 % increase in poverty-related spending . 
Twenty years ago , it may have been true that IMF fiscal policy advice focused on the bottom line of a government &apos;s accounts . 
Over time , as it became increasingly clear that the burden of fiscal adjustment fell on those with the weakest voice - usually the poor - the IMF recognized that a focus on short-run fiscal outcomes was inadequate . 
Since the late 1980 &quot; s , the Fund has regarded investment in human development as a way to promote sustained economic growth . 
Today , the IMF emphasizes protecting ( or increasing ) social expenditures for the poor , while making sure spending is well-targeted , and on improving governance mechanisms so that the voice of the poor is heard . 
Of course , poverty reduction involves more than throwing money at a problem . 
The quality and composition of social spending is just as important as the amount that is spent . 
Social spending should be targeted at the needy . 
In health and education , the poor often do not have good access to services . 
In many of the HIPCs , we find heavy spending on urban hospitals and higher education relative to basic health care and primary education . 
In these countries , only 14 % of health and education spending benefits the poorest 20 % of the population , while 30 % of the spending goes to the richest 20 % . 
The need to target spending applies equally to social benefits . 
Indonesia had large subsidies for cooking oil and other widely-consumed products , largely benefiting the middle class . 
The IMF-supported program , despite heavy criticism , eliminated most of them . 
To improve targeting to yield the largest possible reduction in poverty with the resources available , the IMF now expects all poor countries borrowing from the Fund to prepare comprehensive poverty reduction strategies . 
Second , funds must be efficiently channeled to social expenditures . 
Losses through corruption or excessive spending on program administration need to be minimized . 
Here , improved transparency of government operations is vital . 
Nigeria &apos;s IMF-supported program , for example , embraces the Poverty Reduction Initiative , which aims to use funds productively and to ensure that the public funds for poverty reduction are accounted for in every quarter . 
Finally , it must be recognized that - for whatever reason - even the best-intentioned policies do not necessarily translate into results . 
School enrollment rates rose by 1 % per year , and more quickly for girls than for boys , narrowing the gender gap . 
Infant mortality fell by 22 % per year , and even faster for children under 5 . 
Immunization rates rose by almost 5 % per year . 
Nevertheless , the IMF is not complacent , and seeks to ensure that policies deliver results . 
It is a truism that a country &apos;s future is its people , and promoting better health and education outcomes may be one of the soundest economic decisions a country can make . 
Still , giving priority to education and health care should not be at the expense of other public programs - such as sanitation and rural road-building - that may be just as important for reducing poverty . 
We must not lose sight of the wood for the trees . 
Much remains to be done to improve the lot of the poorest of the poor . 
Indeed , there is much that we still don &apos;t know about how to reduce poverty . 
In many countries , even reliable data about the current state of affairs is hard to come by . 
But the IMF is making every effort to help countries achieve the global objective of halving poverty by 2015 , and as the numbers show , this is not just talk .
