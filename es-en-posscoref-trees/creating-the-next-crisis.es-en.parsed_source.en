Creating the Next Crisis 
WASHINGTON , DC  -  Informed opinion is sharply divided about how the next 12 months will play out for the global economy . 
Those focused on emerging markets are emphasizing accelerating growth , with some forecasts projecting a 5 % increase in world output . 
Others , concerned about problems in Europe and the United States , remain more pessimistic , with growth projections closer to 4 % - and some are even inclined to see a possible &quot; double dip &quot; recession . 
This is an interesting debate , but it misses the bigger picture . 
In response to the crisis of 2007-2009 , governments in most industrialized countries put in place some of the most generous bailouts ever seen for large financial institutions . 
Of course , it is not politically correct to call them bailouts - the preferred language of policymakers is &quot; liquidity support &quot; or &quot; systemic protection . &quot; 
But it amounts to essentially the same thing : when the chips were down , the most powerful governments in the world ( on paper , at least ) deferred again and again to the needs and wishes of people who had lent money to big banks . 
In each instance , the logic was impeccable . 
For example , if the US hadn &apos;t provided essentially unconditional support to Citigroup in 2008 ( under President George W. Bush ) and again in 2009 ( under President Barack Obama ) , the resulting financial collapse would have deepened the global recession and worsened job losses around the world . 
Similarly , if the eurozone had not stepped in - with the help of the International Monetary Fund - to protect Greece and its creditors in recent months , we would have faced further financial distress in Europe and perhaps more broadly . 
In effect , there were repeated games of &quot; chicken &quot; between governments and major financial institutions in the US and Western Europe . 
The governments said : &quot; No more bailouts . &quot; 
The banks said : &quot; If you don &apos;t bail us out , there will most likely be a second Great Depression . &quot; 
The governments thought briefly about that prospect and then , without exception , blinked . 
Creditors were protected and financial sectors &quot; losses were transferred to the domestic government ( as in Ireland ) or to the European Central Bank ( as in Greece ) . 
Elsewhere ( the US ) , the losses were covered up with a great deal of regulatory &quot; forbearance &quot; ( i.e. , agreeing to look the other way while banks rebuild their capital by trading securities ) . 
And it worked - in the sense that we are now experiencing an economic recovery , albeit one with a disappointingly slow employment rebound in the US and some European countries . 
So what is the problem with the policies of 2007-2009 , and why can &apos;t we just plan on doing something similar in the future if we ever face a crisis of this nature again ? 
The problem is incentives - what bailouts imply for attitudes and behavior within the financial sector . 
The protection that was extended to banks and other financial institutions since summer 2007 , and more comprehensively since the failure of Lehman Brothers and AIG in September 2008 , sends a simple signal . 
If you are &quot; big &quot; relative to the system , you are more likely to get generous government support when there is system-wide vulnerability . 
How big is &quot; big enough &quot; remains an open and interesting question . 
Major hedge funds are presumably looking for ways to become bigger and take on &quot; systemic importance . &quot; 
Ideally - from their point of view - they will bulk up without attracting regulatory scrutiny , i.e. , no ex ante limits on their risk-taking activities will be imposed . 
If all goes well , these hedge funds - and of course the banks that are already undoubtedly Too Big to Fail ( TBTF ) - get a great deal of upside . 
Of course , if anything goes wrong , everyone who is TBTF - and who has lent to TBTF firms - expects to receive government protection . 
This expectation lowers the cost of credit for megabanks today ( relative to their competitors , which are small enough that they are more likely to be allowed to fail ) . 
As a result , all financial institutions gain a powerful incentive to bulk up ( and borrow more ) in hope of also becoming bigger and therefore &quot; safer &quot; ( from creditors &quot; point of view , not from a social perspective . ) 
Top US policymakers acknowledge that this structure of incentives is a problem - interestingly , many of their European counterparts are not yet willing even to discuss these issues openly . 
But the rhetoric from the White House and the Treasury Department is &quot; we have ended TBTF &quot; with financial reform legislation currently before Congress and likely to be signed by Obama within a month . 
Unfortunately , this is simply not the case . 
On the critical dimension of excessive bank size and what it implies for systemic risk , there was a concerted effort by Senators Ted Kaufman and Sherrod Brown to impose a size cap on the largest banks - very much in accordance with the spirit of the original &quot; Volcker Rule &quot; proposed in January 2010 by Obama himself . 
In an almost unbelievable volte face , for reasons that remain somewhat mysterious , Obama &apos;s administration itself shot down this approach . 
&quot; If enacted , Brown-Kaufman would have broken up the six biggest banks in America , &quot; a senior Treasury official said . 
&quot; If we &apos;d been for it , it probably would have happened . 
But we weren &apos;t , so it didn &apos;t . &quot; 
Whether the world economy grows now at 4 % or 5 % matters , but it does not much affect our medium-term prospects . 
The US financial sector received an unconditional bailout - and is not now facing any kind of meaningful re-regulation . 
We are setting ourselves up , without question , for another boom based on excessive and reckless risk-taking at the heart of the world &apos;s financial system . 
This can end only one way : badly .
