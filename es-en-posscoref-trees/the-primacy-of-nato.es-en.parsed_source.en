The Primacy of NATO 
F OR PUBLICATION FEBRUARY 22 , NOT BEFORE 
They are here to demonstrate a strong spirit of unity in the transatlantic community , a determination to look forward and take action together . 
There are important questions to be addressed , not only about the direction of NATO &apos;s missions and operations , but also about the future of transatlantic security cooperation and the role the Alliance will play . 
The broad range of issues to be discussed mirrors the essential place of the Alliance in addressing today &apos;s security challenges . 
They will discuss how to reinforce the success the international community has had in helping to build a new , democratic Afghanistan . 
NATO and its members are already providing the essential security Afghanistan needs in order to make its aspirations for self-sustaining peace and prosperity a reality . 
Today , NATO leaders will reaffirm their commitment to the courageous people of this country : we will help them for as long as it takes . 
Iraq is a case in point . 
All 26 NATO nations are now , as an Alliance , working together to respond to the Iraqi government &apos;s request for support : by training Iraqi security forces , by providing equipment , or by helping to fund NATO &apos;s efforts . 
We are building a stronger relationship with the broader Middle East . 
Already , the Alliance is developing a deeper political dialogue and more practical cooperation with the countries of North Africa , Israel and Jordan , and opening up a discussion with the Gulf States . 
When Dr. Rice made her first visit as Secretary of State to NATO headquarters two weeks ago , Alliance Foreign Ministers had a discussion about the Middle East Peace Process . 
The broader Middle East will be on the agenda of Heads and State and Government again today . 
Many other critical political issues will be addressed : from ensuring stability in Kosovo as the political situation evolves this year ; to the importance of maintaining strong relations and a frank dialogue with Russia ; to building a stronger relationship with the EU , one that maximises the complementarity between our two organisations ; to supporting the new government in Ukraine as it finds its path . 
In that regard , this morning NATO leaders will welcome their first meeting with President Yushchenko . 
They will share with him their common determination to help him build a better , more democratic future for his people , and strengthen Ukraine &apos;s Euro-Atlantic integration . 
But NATO leaders will also lift their eyes from the immediate challenges of the day , and discuss a fundamental strategic question as well : how to use NATO to its fullest potential as a platform for holding political discussions and building transatlantic consensus across the wide range of the issues where Europe and North America share common interests and wish to defend common values . 
NATO is the only permanent political forum in which North America sits together with Europe . 
This is a unique framework for profound transatlantic political consultation and effective military cooperation . 
And it works  -  but it can do more . 
The Alliance can and should be the place to discuss and debate a broader range of political issues . 
Indeed , as we face today &apos;s security challenges - terrorism , proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failed states - we cannot afford not to . 
I am encouraged that , more and more , Alliance leaders are coming to share the same view . 
Today &apos;s Summit meeting will give a new impulse to NATO &apos;s political evolution . 
That evolution will accelerate in the coming months and years , as NATO &apos;s strengthens its role in shaping and delivering transatlantic security cooperation in the 21st century .
