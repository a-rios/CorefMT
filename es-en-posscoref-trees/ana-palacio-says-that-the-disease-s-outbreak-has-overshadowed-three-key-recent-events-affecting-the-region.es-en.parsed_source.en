Africa Beyond Ebola 
MADRID - Among this summer &apos;s grave global worries , the spread of the Ebola virus has monopolized the discussion of Sub-Saharan Africa and reinvigorated hoary notions of disorder and despair - at a time when a new image of a dynamic Africa was emerging . 
In fact , there is still strong reason for optimism about the region &apos;s prospects . 
The Ebola outbreak overshadowed three key events affecting the region . 
On July 1 , a major organizational restructuring at the World Bank Group was implemented . 
Two weeks later , the BRICS ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) announced the establishment of the New Development Bank . 
And , in early August , African government and business leaders gathered in Washington , DC , for a summit that could portend transformative private investment in Africa . 
Such investment is essential in a world in which net private capital flows to developing countries outstrip official development assistance by a margin of ten to one . 
If this is to be a turning point for Africa , rather than another false dawn , this summer must be the start of a prolonged effort to stimulate private-sector engagement . 
The reorganization of the World Bank is a central part of a larger effort under its president , Jim Yong Kim , to reposition the Bank as a facilitator vis-a-vis the private sector , rather than a primary provider . 
From 2009 to 2013 , new investment commitments by the International Finance Corporation , the World Bank &apos;s private-sector lending arm , have risen 73 % . 
Meanwhile , the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency , the Bank &apos;s provider of political risk insurance covering investments in developing countries , has moved to expand its activities , both by broadening the types of projects that it supports and widening existing definitions to allow greater coverage . 
July &apos;s restructuring occurs within the context of these broader moves . 
In reorganizing the World Bank Group &apos;s central component , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , Kim has adopted a management-consulting model that unites expertise with regional coverage . 
Seeking to eliminate the bureaucratic &quot; silos &quot; that have isolated regional experts from one another , 14 global practice groups in areas such as energy , water , and education have been established to bring to bear the full force of the World Bank &apos;s considerable knowledge on projects and partnerships . 
Just as the World Bank was repositioning itself , the BRICS agreed to establish their own bank . 
There are significant outstanding issues about how the New Development Bank will operate , but early indications suggest that infrastructure will be central to its activities , with an emphasis on Africa . 
The World Bank estimates that insufficient infrastructure reduces productivity in Africa by approximately 40 % . 
The entrance of a new player with initial authorized capital of $ 100 billion - along with the United States &quot; Power Africa program , which has garnered $ 26 billion in commitments since its launch last year , and the World Bank &apos;s new Global Infrastructure Facility - promises to help ease infrastructure financing significantly . 
But , as of now , the New Development Bank is little more than a statement of political solidarity , and whether it comes into existence remains to be seen . 
Even if it does begin to function , the BRICS lack what gives development banks , and the World Bank in particular , legitimacy and weight : a staff composed mostly of dedicated experts who are among the world &apos;s best . 
Finally , the high profile of the US-Africa Leaders Summit , with more than 40 heads of state in attendance , as well as President Barack Obama &apos;s direct involvement , generated buzz about Africa . 
US businesses and investors certainly gained more awareness about Africa &apos;s potential and a deeper understanding of the variety of investment climates throughout the continent . 
But , though the summit may be called a success , its long-term implications are unclear , particularly given the uncertainty about what will follow . 
At the moment , there does not seem to be a plan to institutionalize the summit . 
Moreover , the participation of so many heads of state overshadowed that of African business leaders . 
The practical connections that US companies will need when deciding whether to invest could have been cultivated on the summit &apos;s margins , or in its aftermath , but were not . 
Laying a foundation for future engagement requires ongoing commitment and effort that goes beyond mere publicity . 
The same could be said about the World Bank . 
There is much work to be done in integrating the new organizational model with existing Bank structures and practice areas . 
Even if this transition occurs seamlessly , the Bank faces a serious internal struggle against entrenched bureaucratic interests and a pervasive institutional mindset that is overly risk-averse and fixates on processes rather than outcomes . 
In recent years , Africa , once a land of pity , has emerged as a land of opportunity . 
If it is to become a land of performance , the goal must be to facilitate investment , both domestic and foreign . 
That will demand effort and commitment ; given that a stable international order increasingly depends on a prosperous and growing Africa , it is a goal that the world cannot afford to miss .
