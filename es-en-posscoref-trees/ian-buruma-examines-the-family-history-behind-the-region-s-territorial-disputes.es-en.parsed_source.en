East Asia &apos;s Sins of the Fathers 
NEW YORK - One way to look at the growing military tensions over a few tiny islands in the East China Sea is to see in recent events a straightforward case of power politics . 
China is rising , Japan is in the economic doldrums , and the Korean peninsula remains divided . 
It is only natural that China would try to reassert its historical dominance over the region . 
Being subservient to American power , as Japan has been since 1945 , was the inevitable consequence of a catastrophic war . 
Most Japanese can live with that . 
And yet , because East Asian politics remains highly dynastic , a biographical explanation might be just as useful . 
Shinzo Abe , the Japanese prime minister , is the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi , once the top industrial bureaucrat of wartime Japan . 
Imprisoned by the Americans as a war criminal in 1945 , Kishi was released without trial at the beginning of the Cold War , and was elected Prime Minister as a conservative in 1957 . 
Kishi was a nationalist with fascist tendencies during the 1930 &quot; s and 1940 &quot; s . 
After the war , an equally deep aversion to Communism made him a staunch ally of the United States ; 
Richard Nixon became a close friend . 
His lifelong quest was to revise the pacifist Japanese constitution , written by the Americans just after the war , and turn Japan into a proud military power once more . 
Abe &apos;s greatest wish is to complete the project that eluded his grandfather : abandon constitutional pacifism and bury the war crimes of Kishi &apos;s generation , while remaining allied with the US against China . 
As a right-wing nationalist , Abe feels compelled to resist the dominance of China , if only rhetorically for the time being . 
One of Kishi &apos;s greatest Cold War allies - apart from Nixon - was the South Korean strongman President Park Chung-hee , who came to power in a military coup a year after Kishi resigned as prime minister . 
Park , too , had a dubious wartime career . 
Under the Japanese name of Takagi Masao , he served as an officer in the Japanese Imperial Army . 
He graduated from a military academy in Manchuria , where Kishi had once ruled over an industrial empire that was built on Chinese slave labor . 
Like Kishi , Park was a nationalist . 
Park Geun-hye , South Korea &apos;s current president , is his daughter . 
Park Geun-hye adored her father at least as much as Abe loved his grandfather , but the result of her dynastic connection is the opposite of Abe &apos;s . 
To be seen as a Korean nationalist today , she must distance herself from some of her father &apos;s political ties , especially his links with Japan . 
Though still admired by many South Koreans for rebuilding the country from the ruins of war , his legacy , like that of many members of the old conservative elite , is tainted by wartime collaboration . 
So his daughter must confront Japan over territorial disputes , to avoid inheriting the stigma of her father &apos;s colonial past . 
The case of the current Chinese leader , Xi Jinping , is perhaps the most complicated of the three . 
His father , Xi Zhongxun , was one of the top leaders of the Communist revolution . 
A guerilla leader in the war against Japan , he helped to defeat Chiang Kai-shek &apos;s Nationalists in China &apos;s civil war , became a member of the Central Committee , and then chief of propaganda , Vice Premier , and Governor of Guangdong . 
An impeccable Communist career , one might think , giving his son no need to distance himself or to complete a frustrated ambition . 
But Xi &apos;s nationalism , too , has a history . 
Chairman Mao &apos;s main aim was to consolidate his revolution at home . 
Territorial disputes over unimportant islands could be laid to rest . 
He did not even bother to reclaim Hong Kong from the British . 
It was only when Deng Xiaoping opened the door to trade with capitalist countries that anti-Japanese sentiments were deliberately stirred up . 
Neither Marxism nor Maoism could be used to justify China &apos;s joining the capitalist world . 
The more the leadership opened up the Chinese economy , the more it stoked popular anger over past wrongs , especially those committed by Japan . 
The man who was most responsible for Deng &apos;s Open Door policies was none other than Xi &apos;s father , Xi Zhongxun . 
Always a pragmatic Communist , the elder Xi had been the target of several purges under Mao , when relative moderates were frequently denounced as counterrevolutionaries . 
His son appears to follow in this pragmatic tradition , open to business with the world . 
That is why he , too , like Deng &apos;s reformers , must burnish his nationalist credentials by standing up to Japan and asserting Chinese dominance in East Asia . 
None of these leaders - Xi , Abe , or Park - wants a real war . 
Much of their posturing is for domestic consumption . 
One reason why they can engage in this dangerous brinkmanship is the continuing presence of the US as the regional policeman . 
America &apos;s armed forces are the buffer between the two Koreas , and between China and Japan . 
The US presence allows East Asia &apos;s rival powers to act irresponsibly . 
The only thing that might change their behavior would be US withdrawal of its military force . 
But that is still regarded by the Americans , Japanese , Koreans , and probably even the Chinese as too much of a risk . 
As a result , the status quo is likely to persist , which means that nationalist grandstanding over conflicting territorial claims is far from over .
