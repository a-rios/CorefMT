Children &apos;s Champions 
LONDON - The British social reformer , Eglantyne Jebb , once noted that the only international language that the world understands is the cry of a child . 
Nearly a century after Jebb founded Save the Children , the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Malala Yousafzai , the 17-year-old campaigner for girls &quot; education , and child-labor opponent Kailash Satyarthi . 
The Nobel Committee thus recognized a global civil-rights struggle against child trafficking , child labor , child marriages , and discrimination against girls . 
Given recent and ongoing conflicts in Syria , Iraq , Gaza , and South Sudan , which have devastated so many young lives , the Nobel committee had good cause to highlight children &apos;s suffering . 
Schools , which should have been sanctuaries , have become military targets . 
Thousands of children in Syria and Iraq have been press-ganged into military service . 
Despite the efforts of United Nations relief agencies , the carnage this summer has created an additional one million child refugees . 
The vulnerability of children was illustrated only too well six months ago , when the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram ( whose name means &quot; Western education is a sin &quot; ) abducted 276 Nigerian schoolgirls . 
Even if all of the kidnapped girls are returned safely , as a truce between the group and Nigeria &apos;s government stipulates , there are still 15 million children under the age of 14 worldwide who are forced to work , often in appallingly exploitative environments . 
A further ten million school-age girls are married off as child brides each year , while around 32 million girls are denied the right even to an elementary education . 
But a worldwide counter-offensive is now underway . 
Satyarthi &apos;s Global March Against Child Labor has rescued thousands of boys and girls , as young as eight , working as slave laborers in India &apos;s back streets and sweatshops . 
The organization has inspired a worldwide campaign to lift children out of exploitation and into education . 
Meanwhile , Yousafzai - following her defiant response to an assassin &apos;s bullet two years ago - has led the fight to end discrimination against girls . 
Her impact has been remarkable . 
Visiting Pakistan immediately after that attack , I saw angry girls cowed into submission by their fear of the Taliban . 
On a return visit a few weeks ago , I addressed some 2,000 girls about education . 
Inspired by Yousafzai , they were far from quiescent ; on the contrary , they were vocal in their demands for the same rights that boys enjoy . 
Hundreds of local child-liberation groups , some in the least promising of places , have emerged to fight for children &apos;s civil rights . 
These include the Freed Kamlari Development Forum ( which combats girls &quot; slavery in Nepal ) ; the Upper Manya Krobo Rights of the Child Club ; and the Yellow movement , which campaigns for youth rights in Ethiopia . 
These young activists may not yet be trending on Twitter or Facebook , or even be household names in their own countries , but support for their cause is growing fast . 
Consider the campaign for child-marriage-free zones , which began with schoolgirls in 20 areas of Bangladesh uniting to fight against child marriage . 
The movement now operates in Pakistan , India , and Africa . 
The success of these groups , led by Plan International , has forced governments to toughen laws against child marriage , and - as in Pakistan &apos;s Sindh province - beef up enforcement and policing . 
Yousafzai and Satyarthi would undoubtedly point to thousands of others like them who are protesting against child marriage , labor , and trafficking . 
Indeed , for the past two years , the Youth Courage Awards have recognized campaigners - role models for a new generation - who have transformed the prospects for children in their own countries . 
They include : India &apos;s Ashwini , a visually impaired champion for disabled children ; 
Attal , who created a girls school in his family kitchen in Afghanistan ; 
Shweta who grew up in a South Asian brothel and created a support group for trafficked and abused girls ; and Salyne , whose organization , Teach For Lebanon , is helping to educate many of the country &apos;s half-million Syrian and Palestinian refugees . 
One Youth Courage award winner , Razia , who at the age of nine was forced to stitch footballs when she should have been in school , started her civil-rights work after Satyarthi rescued her . 
She is now leading the campaign in India for the right to education . 
The campaign against child exploitation and for education has become global . 
The organization A World at School is now circulating the biggest-ever petition in support of the Millennium Development Goal of universal education . 
The sad fact is that children are doing more than adults to fight for their own rights . 
Nonetheless , the child-liberation movement that Satyarthi , Yousafzai , and others have helped to mobilize is growing by the day , and new , courageous voices are speaking out against injustices that cannot be allowed to persist for another generation .
