The Dirt on Nuclear Power 
SINGAPORE - Japan &apos;s nuclear crisis is a nightmare , but it is not an anomaly . 
In fact , it is only the latest in a long line of nuclear accidents involving meltdowns , explosions , fires , and loss of coolant - accidents that have occurred during both normal operation and emergency conditions , such as droughts and earthquakes . 
Nuclear safety demands clarity about terms . 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States generally separates unplanned nuclear &quot; events &quot; into two classes , &quot; incidents &quot; and &quot; accidents . &quot; 
Incidents are unforeseen events and technical failures that occur during normal plant operation and result in no off-site releases of radiation or severe damage to equipment . 
Accidents refer to either off-site releases of radiation or severe damage to plant equipment . 
The International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale uses a seven-level ranking scheme to rate the significance of nuclear and radiological events : levels 1-3 are &quot; incidents , &quot; and 4-7 are &quot; accidents , &quot; with a &quot; Level 7 Major Accident &quot; consisting of &quot; a major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures . &quot; 
Under these classifications , the number of nuclear accidents , even including the meltdowns at Fukushima Daiichi and Fukushima Daini , is low . 
At least 99 nuclear accidents meeting this definition , totaling more than $ 20.5 billion in damages , occurred worldwide from 1952 to 2009 - or more than one incident and $ 330 million in damage every year , on average , for the past three decades . 
Indeed , when compared to other energy sources , nuclear power ranks higher than oil , coal , and natural gas systems in terms of fatalities , second only to hydroelectric dams . 
There have been 57 accidents since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 . 
While only a few involved fatalities , those that did collectively killed more people than have died in commercial US airline accidents since 1982 . 
Another index of nuclear-power accidents - this one including costs beyond death and property damage , such as injured or irradiated workers and malfunctions that did not result in shutdowns or leaks - documented 956 incidents from 1942 to 2007 . 
Mistakes are not limited to reactor sites . 
Accidents at the Savannah River reprocessing plant released ten times as much radio 足 iodine as the accident at Three Mile Island , and a fire at the Gulf United facility in New York in 1972 scattered an undisclosed amount of plutonium , forcing the plant to shut down permanently . 
At the Mayak Industrial Reprocessing Complex in Russia &apos;s southern Urals , a storage tank holding nitrate acetate salts exploded in 1957 , releasing a massive amount of radioactive material over 20,000 square kilometers , forcing the evacuation of 272,000 people . 
In September 1994 , an explosion at Indonesia &apos;s Serpong research reactor was triggered by the ignition of methane gas that had seeped from a storage room and exploded when a worker lit a cigarette . 
Accidents have also occurred when nuclear reactors are shut down for refueling or to move spent nuclear fuel into storage . 
In 1999 , operators loading spent fuel into dry-storage at the Trojan Reactor in Oregon found that the protective zinc-carbon coating had started to produce hydrogen , which caused a small explosion . 
Unfortunately , on- 足 site accidents at nuclear reactors and fuel facilities are not the only cause of concern . 
The August 2003 blackout in the northeastern US revealed that more than a dozen nuclear reactors in the US and Canada were not properly maintaining backup diesel generators . 
In Ontario during the blackout , reactors de 足 signed to unlink from the grid automatically and remain in standby mode instead went into full shutdown , with only two of twelve reac 足 tors behaving as expected . 
As environmental lawyers Richard Webster and Julie LeMense argued in 2008 , &quot; the nuclear industry ... is like the financial industry was prior to the crisis &quot; that erupted that year . 
&quot; &#91; T &#93; here are many risks that are not being properly managed or regulated . &quot; 
This state of affairs is worrying , to say the least , given the severity of harm that a single serious accident can cause . 
The meltdown of a 500-megawatt reactor located 30 miles from a city would cause the immediate death of an estimated 45,000 people , injure roughly another 70,000 , and cause $ 17 billion in property damage . 
A successful attack or accident at the Indian Point power plant near New York City , apparently part of Al Qaeda &apos;s original plan for September 11 , 2001 , would have resulted in 43,700 immediate fatalities and 518,000 cancer deaths , with cleanup costs reaching $ 2 trillion . 
To put a serious accident in context , according to data from my forthcoming book Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power , if 10 million people were exposed to radiation from a complete nuclear meltdown ( the containment structures fail completely , exposing the inner reactor core to air ) , about 100,000 would die from acute radiation sickness within six weeks . 
About 50,000 would experience acute breathlessness , and 240,000 would develop acute hypothyroidism . 
About 350,000 males would be temporarily sterile , 100,000 women would stop menstruating , and 100,000 children would be born with cognitive deficiencies . 
There would be thousands of spontaneous abortions and more than 300,000 later cancers . 
Advocates of nuclear energy have made considerable political headway around the world in recent years , touting it as a safe , clean , and reliable alternative to fossil fuels . 
Perhaps the unfolding tragedy in Japan will finally be enough to stop the nuclear renaissance from materializing .
