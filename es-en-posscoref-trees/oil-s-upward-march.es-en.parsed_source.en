Oil &apos;s Upward March 
IRVING , TEXAS - When OPEC members met in Vienna recently , the Saudis failed to control the meeting , OPEC &apos;s production ceiling remained unchanged , and member countries are setting their own output levels . 
After all , it has survived major wars , numerous diplomatic disputes , and two major market collapses . 
In fact , the secret to OPEC &apos;s survival is its weakness , not its strength . 
Friction or no friction , OPEC has been , and will always be , irrelevant to market forces on the ground . 
OPEC has never had market power , but Saudi Arabia has , and Saudi market power has always been assigned , mistakenly , to OPEC . 
The Saudis did not like the recent meeting . 
They decided to go it alone . 
Can they deliver ? 
The answer is no . 
The global oil market has become a large sea that generates its own storms , which guarantee that the sea will continue to grow . 
Looking at recent history , one can identify four factors that will continue to drive oil prices higher unless a major earthquake brings the market to its knees . 
The first factor is the relationship between oil prices and economic growth in the oil-producing countries . 
Higher prices fuel higher growth in these countries , which , accompanied by a population boom , leads to higher domestic energy consumption . 
That , in turn , reduces oil exports , driving up prices further . 
Only a major recession could break this cycle ; otherwise , we are headed for an energy crisis . 
Of course , prices cannot continue to rise indefinitely - the price increase will ration demand . 
The increase in energy demand has already led to power shortages in the oil-producing countries , which are expected to reduce exports this summer . 
More crude oil will be burned in power plants , more diesel will be burned in private generators , and more gasoline will be burned in SUVs from Riyadh to Kuwait City during blackouts in which the only place to keep cool will be in a moving car . 
Second , there is the relationship between oil prices and the need for income diversification in the oil-producing countries . 
As oil prices rise , these countries &quot; dependence on the oil sector increases , despite all efforts to diversify their economies . 
To combat the impact of such dependence , they spend oil revenues on other sectors , leaving the oil sector with little investment . 
As global oil demand increases , there is not enough capacity to meet it - a cycle that will continue until demand collapses . 
The rhetoric of energy independence in the oil-consuming countries makes the situation even worse : the oil-producing countries are building energy-intensive industries to guarantee a market for their oil once consuming nations wean themselves of imported oil . 
They intend to export oil embedded in other products , such as petrochemicals , plastic , aluminum , etc . 
And they can build such plants in faster than the oil-consuming countries can establish alternatives to oil imports , exacerbating future shortages . 
Again , higher prices will ration global oil demand , but only after a period of economic pain in some regions around the world . 
The third factor is the vicious circle of oil prices and the value of the US dollar . 
Higher oil prices increase America &apos;s trade deficits , which in turn lower the value of the dollar . Owing to the inverse relationship between oil prices and the dollar , the weaker dollar increases oil prices , which increases the trade deficit further , putting more downward pressure on the dollar . 
Oil prices will continue to rise until demand collapses . 
Statistical evidence suggests that this relationship will weaken once the real-estate market recovers , but this remains a long-run prospect . 
Finally , there is the relationship between oil prices and fiscal and monetary policies in the oil-consuming countries . 
To combat the effect of high oil prices , consuming countries adopt expansionary economic policies , lowering interest rates and increasing government spending . 
But continued growth increases demand for oil , sending prices even higher . The alternative to monetary and fiscal expansion is recession , at which point oil prices would stop rising . 
Given the current turmoil in the Middle East , the loss of Libyan and Yemeni oil , and increasing energy demand in the oil-producing countries , any increase in Saudi oil exports , if any , would have a limited impact on the market . 
Oil production does not matter ; exports do , which means that announcements of increases in oil output are irrelevant for prices . 
Indeed , regardless of what OPEC or its members decide , the vicious cycles described here will support oil prices around the world probably in the range of $ 70- $ 90 per barrel . 
That said , OPEC members and oil-consuming countries policymakers alike should not forget that nothing cures high prices like high prices .
