Five Reasons for Slow Growth 
MILAN - A remarkable pattern has emerged since the 2008 global financial crisis : Governments , central banks , and international financial institutions have consistently had to revise their growth forecasts downward . 
With very few exceptions , this has been true of projections for the global economy and individual countries alike . 
It is a pattern that has caused real damage , because overoptimistic forecasts delay measures that are needed to boost growth , and thus impede full economic recovery . 
Forecasters need to come to terms with what has gone wrong ; fortunately , as the post-crisis experience lengthens , some of the missing pieces are coming into clear focus . 
I have identified five . 
First , the capacity for fiscal intervention - at least among developed economies - has been underutilized . 
As former United States Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Frank Newman argued in a recent book , Freedom from National Debt , a country &apos;s capacity for fiscal intervention is better assessed by examining its aggregate balance sheet than by the traditional method of comparing its debt ( a liability ) to its GDP ( a flow ) . 
Reliance on the traditional method has resulted in missed opportunities , particularly given that productive public-sector investment can more than pay for itself . 
Investments in infrastructure , education , and technology help drive long-term growth . 
It does not take a lot of growth to offset even substantial investment - especially given current low borrowing costs . 
Research by the International Monetary Fund has indicated that these fiscal multipliers - the second factor overlooked by forecasters - vary with underlying economic conditions . 
In economies with excess capacity ( including human capital ) and a high degree of structural flexibility , the multipliers are greater than once thought . 
In the US , for instance , structural flexibility contributed to economic recovery and helped the country adapt to long-term technological changes and global market forces . 
In Europe , by contrast , structural change faces resistance . 
Fiscal stimulus in Europe may still be justified , but structural rigidity will lower its impact on long-term growth . 
Europe &apos;s fiscal interventions would be easier to justify if they were accompanied by microeconomic reforms targeted at increasing flexibility . 
A third piece of the forecast puzzle is the disparity between the behavior of financial markets and that of the real economy . 
Judged only by asset prices , one would have to conclude that growth is booming . 
A major contributor to this divergence has been ultra-loose monetary policy , which , by flooding financial markets with liquidity , was supposed to boost growth . 
But it remains unclear whether elevated asset prices are supporting aggregate demand or mainly shifting the distribution of wealth . 
It is equally unclear what will happen to asset prices when monetary assistance is withdrawn . 
A fourth factor is the quality of government . 
In recent years , there has been no shortage of examples of governments abusing their powers to favor the ruling elite , their supporters , and a variety of special interests , with detrimental effects on regulation , public investment , the delivery of services , and growth . 
It is critically important that public services , public investment , and public policy are well managed . 
Countries that attract and motivate skilled public managers outperform their peers . 
Finally , and most important , the magnitude and duration of the drop in aggregate demand has been greater than expected , partly because employment and median incomes have been lagging behind growth . 
This phenomenon preceded the crisis , and high levels of household debt have exacerbated its impact in the aftermath . 
The stagnation of incomes in the bottom 75 % of the distribution presents an especially large challenge , because it depresses consumption , undermines social cohesion ( and thus political stability and effectiveness ) , and decreases intergenerational mobility - especially where public education is poor . 
Sometimes change occurs at a pace that outstrips the capacity of individuals and systems to respond . 
Labor markets have been knocked out of equilibrium as new technology and shifting global supply chains have caused demand in the labor market to change faster than supply can adjust . 
This is not a permanent condition , but the transition will be long and complex . 
The same forces that are dramatically increasing the world economy &apos;s productive potential are largely responsible for the adverse trends in income distribution . 
Digital technology and capital have eliminated middle-income jobs or moved them offshore , generating an excess supply of labor that has contributed to income stagnation precisely in that range . 
A more muscular response will require an awareness of the nature of the challenge and a willingness to meet it by investing heavily in key areas - particularly education , health care , and infrastructure . 
It must be recognized that this is a difficult moment and countries must mobilize their resources to help their people with the transition . 
That will mean redistributing income and ensuring access to essential basic services . 
If countering inequality and promoting intergenerational opportunity introduces some marginal inefficiencies and blunts some incentives , it is more than worth the price . 
Public provision of critical basic services like education or health care may never be as efficient as private-sector alternatives ; but where efficiency entails exclusion and inequality of opportunity , public provision is not a mistake . 
One hopes that a growing awareness of the significance of these and other factors will have a positive effect on policy agendas in the coming year .
