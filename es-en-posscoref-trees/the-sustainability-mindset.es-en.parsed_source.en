The Sustainability Mindset 
MILAN - Markets and capitalist incentives have great strengths in promoting economic efficiency , growth , and innovation . 
And , as Ben Friedman of Harvard University argued persuasively in his 2006 book The Moral Consequences of Growth , economic growth is good for open and democratic societies . 
But markets and capitalist incentives have clear weaknesses in ensuring stability , equity , and sustainability , which can adversely affect political and social cohesion . 
Obviously , abandoning market-capitalist systems , and implicitly growth , is not really an option . Collectively , we have little choice but to try to adapt the system to changing technological and global conditions in order to achieve stability , equity ( in terms of opportunity and outcomes alike ) , and sustainability . 
Of these three imperatives , sustainability may be the most complex and challenging . 
For many people , sustainability is associated with finite natural resources and the environment . 
The global economy will probably triple in size in the next quarter-century , largely owing to growth in developing countries as they catch up to developed-country incomes and adopt similar consumption patterns . 
Thus , there is a well-founded fear that the planet &apos;s natural resources ( broadly defined ) and recuperative capacities will not withstand the pressure . 
To some , this logic leads to the conclusion that growth is the problem , and that less growth is the solution . 
The alternative is to change the growth model in order to lighten the impact of higher levels of economic activity on natural resources and the environment . 
But there is no existing alternative to which we can all switch . 
Changing the growth model means inventing a new one over time , step-by-step , from complementary parts . 
The two key ingredients seem to be education and values . 
Everyone , not just policymakers , needs to understand the consequences of our individual and collective choices . 
We need to be aware for example , that population growth and rising consumption levels have intergenerational consequences , and that how we conduct ourselves will affect the lifestyles and opportunities of our children and grandchildren . 
Thus far , the quality of our choices has been unimpressive , reflecting little sensitivity to sustainability and the impact of our choices on future generations . 
As a result , many developed countries have built up dangerously large public debts and even larger non-debt liabilities , owing to unsustainable growth patterns . 
Most of us , I believe , do not knowingly make choices that adversely affect future generations . 
Moreover , an unfunded liability path , once taken , is hard to leave , because at the point of departure , some generation is paying for past commitments and at least beginning to fund future ones . 
That seems unfair , because it is . 
Most people might agree that living beyond our means in the aggregate , via unfunded social services and insurance , or disproportionate use of resources , imposes a burden on our offspring . 
Too often , it is easier to deal with the distributional problem by shifting the burden to those who are not present , and who are insufficiently represented by those who are . 
Education and values are the foundation of sound individual and , ultimately , collective choices . 
Without them , the incentives and policies that economists rightly argue are needed to increase energy efficiency , limit carbon emissions , economize on water usage , and much more will lack support and fail in the democratic decision-making process . 
If sustainability is to triumph , it must be predominantly a bottom-up process . 
Environmentalists are right to focus on education and individual choices , even when their policy proposals are not always on target . 
Education and values will drive local innovation , alter lifestyles , and shift social norms . 
They will also affect business behavior via choices by customers and employees , including business leaders . 
Thus , they are essential components of the formulas needed to pursue sustainable patterns of growth . 
But , while education and values are necessary , they clearly are not sufficient . 
Complementary national policies and international agreements will require careful scientific and economic analysis and thoughtful choices . 
The need for burden-sharing , particularly between advanced and developing countries , will not magically disappear . 
Climate-change risks , though serious , should not be mistaken for the entire sustainability agenda . 
There are clear steps that can be taken . 
Appropriate regulation and sufficiently long time horizons can make structures of all kinds much more energy-efficient , without imposing burdensome costs . 
In a similar way , transportation can become less energy-intensive without restricting mobility . 
Some of these shifts might be subject to international coordination , in order to avoid adverse competitive consequences , whether real or perceived . 
But too much coordination can be a bad thing . 
That is why climate-change negotiations are shifting from the misguided objective of seeking risky 50-year commitments to binding carbon-emissions targets to focusing on parallel , step-by-step processes , including higher energy efficiency , better urban planning , improved transportation systems , and on learning as we go . 
Likewise , businesses and industries that are heavy water users will simply develop new technologies and thrive in the face of scarcity . 
Progress has been helped by growing awareness in populous Asia - and in developing countries generally - that sustainability is the key to achieving their longer-term growth objectives . 
This perspective perhaps comes more naturally in an environment of rapid growth , because their growth models require continual review and adaptation to be sustainable . 
Over time , values shift as knowledge is acquired and disseminated . 
Policies aimed at sustainability are likely to follow . 
What is unknown is whether we will reach that point fast enough to avoid major disruptions , or even potential conflict .
