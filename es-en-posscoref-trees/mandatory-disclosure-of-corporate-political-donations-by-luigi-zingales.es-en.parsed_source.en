We , the Corporations ? 
CHICAGO - You would think that 600,000 comments on a petition would be sufficient to bring an issue to the top of the US Securities and Exchange Commission &apos;s agenda . 
Denying rumors that such a rule will be promulgated soon , SEC Chair Mary Jo White recently told lawmakers that this issue is not at the top of her list of priorities . 
In April , Ann Wagner , a Republican congresswoman , introduced a bill &quot; to prohibit the Securities and Exchange Commission from issuing rules requiring the disclosure of an issuer &apos;s expenditures for political activities . &quot; 
The reason why such an apparently minor issue is gaining so much attention is that it transcends corporate governance and goes to the very essence of America &apos;s democratic system . 
For this reason , it is important to understand what is at stake . 
Freedom of expression is a core democratic principle . 
Integral to this freedom is the right to spend money to disseminate speech . 
Any limitation on spending is a limitation on freedom of speech itself . 
But is this right limited to individuals or does it extend also to associations of individuals ? 
In a controversial decision issued in 2010 - Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission - the US Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment of the US Constitution also protects the free-speech rights of associations of individuals . 
Thus , corporations , as associations of individuals , have the right to spend as much as they want to disseminate their views , including in support of electoral campaigns . 
Whether you like the political consequences of the Citizens United decision or not , it has its own logic . 
And that logic applies outside of the United States as well , and can lead to similar consequences everywhere : an enormous increase in the largest corporations &quot; political power . 
Will parliamentarians become mere spokesmen of corporate interests ? 
Is there any mechanism within the US Constitution , or other constitutions , to prevent this ? 
A logical implication of the view that corporations are &quot; people &quot; is that shareholders should learn about the political spending carried out by the companies in which they invest . 
Disclosure may help democratize political donations , preventing them from having an undue influence in elections . 
If I appoint an agent to manage my money , shouldn &apos;t I want to know how much he spends on political donations in my ( alleged ) interest ? 
And wouldn &apos;t it be preposterous for any rule or regulation to prevent me from finding out ? 
But this is exactly what is happening . 
Not only do companies refuse to disclose to their shareholders how much they spend on political campaigns ; they also are lobbying hard to prevent any rule that would require them to do so . 
The US Chamber of Commerce opposes all such proposed rules as &quot; politically motivated , &quot; because the pressure to require disclosure of election-related corporate spending does not come from institutional investors , but from government pension funds controlled by elected officials . 
But conservative groups are shortsighted in their opposition to mandatory disclosure of such information . 
They believe that it would weaken Republicans and benefit Democrats , and they are right : there is no doubt that the left stands to gain more in the short term from such a requirement . 
The current political game in the US is one in which both Republicans and Democrats compete for corporate money , which they then deploy in expensive campaigns to preserve or increase their power . 
The winners are not the Republicans or the Democrats , or even the companies that fund them . 
The winner is a corrupt form of capitalism that is undermining the US economy , making it less productive and undermining people &apos;s sense of fairness . 
I doubt that a mandatory disclosure rule alone could fix the problem . 
More important , actively blocking that step forces the political system toward a precipice from which democracy cannot return .
