Unsustainable Development Goals 
ARUSHA - At the end of this month , one of the most consequential political conferences of the decade will take place , with more than 150 world leaders gathering in New York to set the path for global development spending - more than $ 2.5 trillion - between now and 2030 . 
But , in fact , heads of state are not expected to do much at the conference at all . 
With the so-called Agenda for Sustainable Development having been quietly finalized by diplomats and United Nations bureaucrats last month , the leaders are expected just to smile for the cameras and sign on the dotted line . 
Unfortunately , they are missing a one-in-a-generation opportunity to do much more good . 
The agenda is the result of years of negotiations . 
But , however admirable that approach may be , it did not prove successful . 
Indeed , looking at the agenda they produced - more than 15,000 words and a headache-inducing 169 development targets - one might conclude that they simply threw everything they had heard into the document . 
Compare this to the last global development agenda , the fairly successful Millennium Development Goals . 
The MDGs included just 18 sharp targets , promising essentially to cut hunger , poverty , and child and maternal mortality , while getting all children in school and improving access to water and sanitation . 
It is not that the new promises are not well-intentioned . 
For example , the agenda calls for the provision of &quot; universal access to safe , inclusive , and accessible green and public spaces , in particular for women and children , older persons , and persons with disabilities &quot; by 2030 . 
Green spaces are nice , but at a time when 1.2 billion people still live in abject poverty , 2.5 billion lack access to water and sanitation , and almost a billion people go to bed hungry each night , are they really a top priority ? 
Funds are limited , after all . 
Some promises seem to be based on an alternate reality . 
One of the ten global promises on education is this contorted formulation : &quot; By 2030 , ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development , including , among others , through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles , human rights , gender equality , promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence , global citizenship , and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture &apos;s contribution to sustainable development . &quot; 
Yet research shows that more than one-third of all school-age children - a quarter-billion in all - currently fail to learn even the fundamentals of reading and mathematics . 
Should we really divert resources away from basic education to ensure that we can promote sustainable development in schools ? 
Other targets assume that helping &quot; small-scale artisanal fishers &quot; and &quot; to promote sustainable tourism &quot; are among the most important goals for the world . 
There is even a target to &quot; ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature . &quot; 
Should we really be diverting resources away from efforts to tackle poverty and hunger in developing countries to raise awareness about environmentally conscious lifestyles ? 
Some targets are even more misguided . 
One promises to achieve &quot; full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men , including for young people and persons with disabilities . &quot; 
While promising full employment might be politically popular , it is impossible , unnecessary , and sometimes even detrimental . 
After all , every economy needs some unemployment to allow workers to change jobs . 
Moreover , all functional governments are already focused on boosting employment . 
And studies show interest groups use &quot; decent work &quot; policies to create great jobs for a minority , while leaving the rest out , often pushing vulnerable workers back into the informal economy and increasing poverty . 
In short , many of the targets are either marginally useful or highly problematic . 
Making matters worse , collecting data on the 169 promises could cost almost two years of development aid . 
As a result , the agenda will leave the world &apos;s poorest far worse off than they could be . 
It is a rather unlikely prospect , but instead of signing the Agenda for Sustainable Development as is , leaders should forego the photo opportunity and spend their time in New York cutting it down to just 19 key development targets . 
That is the number of targets that a panel of Nobel laureates identified in a project for my think tank , the Copenhagen Consensus Center . 
The panel studied more than 1,800 pages of peer-reviewed analysis , in order to determine which potential targets would achieve the most good - something that the UN never did . 
The targets they selected include cutting tuberculosis deaths by 95 % , halving the prevalence of malaria , completing the Doha Round of global trade talks , and ensuring universal access to family planning . 
Channeling the entire development budget to the 19 targets that the panel identified would do four times more good than if we spread it across the UN &apos;s 169 targets , with a large share of those benefits going to the world &apos;s worst-off people . 
In lofty language , the UN claims that the Agenda for Sustainable Development &apos;s 169 targets are &quot; integrated and indivisible . &quot; 
This is nonsense . 
Cutting them back is what should happen . 
And that is exactly what will happen , the day after the UN conference , when leaders return home and recognize - as many quietly do already - that they cannot work on 169 grand targets simultaneously . 
Inevitably , they will choose a smaller number on which to focus . 
We can only hope that they choose those that promise to do the most good .
