More Trade , Less Hunger 
GENEVA - The recent sharp spike in food prices and growing concerns about food security have sparked anxiety worldwide . 
The possibility of being unable to put food on the table fills parents with a deep sense of foreboding . 
And , because the world &apos;s poorest people spend a higher proportion of their income on food , they are the worst affected , raising the risk that years of progress in reducing poverty could be reversed . 
The seemingly unalterable factors generating these record-setting rises in food prices - a shift to higher protein diets in many countries , growing populations , greater use of biofuels , and climate change - suggest that elevated food prices are here to stay . 
In the absence of solutions that alleviate growing pressure on supplies , hunger and malnutrition will increase . 
Clearly , investment in food production must be increased in the medium and longer term . 
But there is a policy prescription available to leaders today that could help remove supply-side obstacles : more trade . 
This proposal may puzzle some , but the logic is straightforward and irrefutable . 
Trade is the transmission belt through which supply adjusts to demand . 
It allows food to travel from lands of plenty to lands of little . 
It allows countries that can produce food efficiently to ship it to those which face resource limitations that hinder food production . 
For example , access to international food supplies allowed Saudi Arabia to abandon its 30-year program of subsidies for domestic wheat production . 
Given the financial burden of the program , and , more importantly , the cost in scarce water , the Saudis decided to phase out the subsidies entirely by 2016 . 
When the transmission belt of international trade that underlies such decisions is disrupted , the result is market turbulence . 
This is why Indonesia , one of the world &apos;s largest producers of rice and maize , recently decided to reduce trade barriers to agriculture imports . 
Today , trade in agricultural products is exposed to far greater distortion than is trade in other goods . 
Trade-distorting subsidies , high import tariffs , and export restrictions act as sand in the gears of the transmission belt and make it more difficult and expensive to bring food to the market - and thus to the family table . 
Export restrictions , for example , play a direct role in aggravating food crises . 
Indeed , some analysts believe that such restrictions were a principal cause of food-price rises in 2008 . 
According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization , they were the single most important reason behind the skyrocketing price of rice in 2008 , when international trade in rice declined by about 7 % ( to two million tons ) from its record 2007 . 
Similarly , the 2010-2011 price rise for cereals is closely linked to the export restrictions imposed by Russia and Ukraine after both countries were hit by severe drought . 
Most people are surprised to learn how shallow international grain markets truly are . 
Only 7 % of global rice production is traded internationally , while only 18 % of wheat production and 13 % of maize is exported . 
Additional restraints on trade are a serious threat to net-food-importing countries , where governments worry that such measures could lead to starvation . 
Those who impose these restrictions follow a shared logic : they do not wish to see their own populations starve . 
So the question is : which alternative policies could allow them to meet this goal ? 
The answer to that question consists in more food production globally , more and stronger social safety nets , more food aid , and , possibly , larger food reserves . 
A conclusion to the Doha Round of global trade negotiations could constitute part of the medium- to long-term response to food-price crises , by removing many of the restrictions and distortions that have muddied the supply-side picture . 
A Doha agreement would greatly reduce rich-world subsidies , which have stymied the developing world &apos;s production capacity , and have pushed developing-country producers completely out of the market for certain commodities . 
The worst kind of subsidies - export subsidies - would be eliminated . 
A Doha agreement would also bring down tariffs , although with certain &quot; flexibilities , &quot; thereby increasing consumers &quot; access to food . 
Globally , more food would be produced where it can be produced more efficiently , thereby creating a more equitable , level international playing field . 
To put it simply : when it comes to tackling food security , trade is part of the solution , not part of the problem .
