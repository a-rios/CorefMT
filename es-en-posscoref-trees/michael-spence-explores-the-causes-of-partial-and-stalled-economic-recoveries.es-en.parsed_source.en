What &apos;s Stopping Robust Recovery ? 
MILAN - The growth map of the global economy is relatively clear . 
The US is in a partial recovery , with growth at 1.5-2 % and lagging employment . 
Europe as a whole is barely above zero growth , with large variations among countries , though with some evidence of painful re-convergence , at least in terms of nominal unit labor costs . 
China &apos;s growth , meanwhile , is leveling off at 7 % , with other developing countries preparing for higher interest rates . 
Many advanced economies must still address the end of the pre-crisis growth pattern generated by excessive domestic demand . 
In such economies , that pattern not only typically depended on leverage ; it also enlarged the non-tradable side of the economy and shrank the tradable side . 
And yet , given that the non-tradable sector is constrained by its reliance on domestic demand , recovery - if it comes - will depend on the tradable sector &apos;s growth potential . 
To realize that potential , the tradable sector has to re-expand at the margin : as a weakening currency causes imports to fall and real unit labor costs decline as nominal wages flatten out , unemployed labor and capital flow toward external markets for goods , services , and resources . 
This is already happening in the United States , where exports are above their previous peak while imports remain subdued ; the current-account deficit is declining ; and even net employment in the tradable sector is increasing ( for the first time in two decades ) . 
Indeed , recent data suggest that more than half of the acceleration in US growth is occurring on the tradable side , even though it accounts for only about one-third of the economy . 
And that contribution is probably an underestimate , because income generated on the tradable supply side produces income that becomes demand on the non-tradable side - a multiplier effect that crosses the tradable / non-tradable boundary . 
The US economy is relatively flexible , and this kind of structural adjustment in the private sector occurs reasonably quickly . 
And yet employment still lags , owing to longer-term factors like labor-saving technology and reconfigurations of global supply chains , in which lower-value-added segments and functions tend to be concentrated in lower-income countries . 
One reason the US recovery is only partial is fiscal drag , a lingering effect of the post-2008 downturn , which shifted some leverage to the public sector , resulting in a growing debt burden that has been addressed - controversially so - by immediate austerity . 
But the main problem is that public-sector investment remains well below growth-sustaining levels . 
The hard part of fully realizing potential growth is shifting the composition of domestic demand from consumption to investment without adding leverage . 
That means paying for it on the public-sector side , via taxes and a reduction in household consumption ( and in wealth accumulation ) . 
It also means getting the balance between domestic and external demand right , and appreciating the sensitivity of medium- and long-term growth to the composition ( and size ) of domestic aggregate demand . 
Against this background , monetary policymakers must be cautious , because low interest rates can shift the growth model back toward leverage and domestic consumer demand , stalling the structural shift to the tradable side that is underway . 
Several European countries also became too dependent on domestic demand and need to rebalance toward the tradable side . 
But the challenge for them is much bigger and the process slower . 
In the first decade of the euro , nominal unit labor costs rose sharply in Greece , Ireland , Italy , Portugal , and Spain , while virtually flatlining in Germany . 
Absent the common currency , these divergences would have been accompanied by exchange-rate adjustments - certainly after ( and perhaps even before ) the pattern of excessive leverage and domestic demand ended . 
But such adjustments cannot happen in a monetary union , so unit labor costs are slowly re-converging via a protracted process of flat nominal wage growth and slowly declining real wages ( a process that would be quicker with higher inflation in Germany and Northern Europe ) . 
With domestic demand in short supply , this slow road essentially postpones or impedes growth via expansion of the tradable sector . 
The speed of structural adjustment is also strongly influenced by how easily employment can shift from an economy &apos;s non-tradable to its tradable side and across segments of global supply chains . 
Countries &quot; degree of labor-market flexibility varies considerably , and the reforms that increase it are critically important . 
For example , the German reforms of 2003-2006 increased flexibility significantly ( though in a more benign global and eurozone setting ) . 
Much is made of Germany &apos;s large current-account surpluses . 
But , just as the eurozone &apos;s struggling economies have an overvalued currency , Germany has an undervalued one , which tends to produce external surpluses and , by definition , an excess of savings over investment . 
An undervalued currency also tends to produce an unbalanced growth model of the opposite kind : an outsize tradable sector and insufficient domestic aggregate demand . 
Because the non-tradable sector in advanced economies tends to create more jobs , this model can lead to an employment problem ( even if it is partly masked by cutting hours rather than workers ) . 
In principle , Germany could try to boost domestic demand by leveraging up ; but , unless the exchange rate adjusts upward to shrink the tradable sector at the margin , doing so would be inflationary . 
The European Central Bank would then have to intervene to maintain the credibility of its commitment to price stability , which is its primary mandate . 
It is little wonder that Germany finds it difficult to achieve a sustainable pattern of balanced growth in the eurozone as it is currently configured . 
Anyone familiar with China &apos;s structural shifts on the supply and demand side will recognize some similarities with the German case . 
The main point is that restoring growth requires a careful analysis of structural balance , attention to demand constraints in the non-tradable sector , and a focus on the impediments to expanding the tradable sector . 
Some of those impediments are supply-side rigidities ; others have more to do with bloated domestic demand . 
Neither can be ignored if robust recovery is to be achieved .
