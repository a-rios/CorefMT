Let History Judge Russia &apos;s Revolutions 
A plethora of anniversaries is arriving in Russia . 
This month marks the 90th anniversary of the October Revolution of 1917 and the 25th anniversary of the death of Leonid Brezhnev . 
Next month will see the 15th anniversary of the Soviet Union &apos;s disintegration . 
Only by understanding that first event , however , can we understand the others . 
The October Revolution has always had many critics . 
The Russian philosopher Ivan Shmelev named it &quot; the great beating of Russia . &quot; 
Vasily Rozanov called it &quot; The Massacre of Russia . &quot; 
Countless authors view it as a tragedy that broke the flow of history and destroyed Russia &apos;s best people . 
But the October Revolution also has its apologists , for whom it marked the beginning of a new era in history , a breakthrough to freedom from a world of slavery and oppression , a salvation for Russia and Europe , and a source of hope for Asia and Africa . 
According to this view , there was no conspiracy , but a great social revolution that , by virtue of a powerful internal logic , brought to power workers , peasants , and the Bolshevik party , which represented their will . 
For the majority of Russians who grew up in the Soviet system , there is truth in both views , but no place for ultra-radical criticism of the October Revolution and other aspects of socialist life in the 20th century USSR . 
The revolution is not only history for many people ; it is also a part of life and consciousness . 
Of course , this does not excuse those who refuse to listen to reasoned analysis about our country &apos;s past , but Russians will not accept glib rants . Studying the Russian Revolution is almost as old as the revolution itself , and has yielded a massive amount of research both at home and abroad . 
But , even today , we are still far from understanding many important factors , connections , motives , reasons , and consequences in what happened in 1917 and during the first years of Soviet power . 
Few events in history have generated so many concepts and theories for their explanation and assessment - or so many falsifications , both crude and sophisticated . 
Both the Bolsheviks and their opponents were involved in these falsifications , concealing , distorting , and concocting facts and circumstances , whether they referred to the real role of Stalin or Trotsky in the revolution or to the behavior of peasants and Cossacks . 
Thousands of names fell out of the history , people &apos;s deeds were &quot; passed &quot; to others , and the nature , motives , and activities of parties , groups , national movements , and classes were distorted . 
The revolution and its leaders were idolized , and falsified reputations and biographies were created . 
The real course of events was simplified and &quot; straightened , &quot; with each stage of the revolution made into the natural continuation of the previous one . 
Nobody talked about the revolution leaders &quot; mistakes , doubts , hesitations , and ignorance . 
The most important archives were inaccessible , and some documents were destroyed . 
The collapse of the USSR and the Communist Party opened new horizons - and almost all archives - for historians . 
Masses of documents and other sources related to the beginnings of Soviet power became accessible for survey and analysis . 
Today , no matter what people say of Vladimir Putin &apos;s administration , we are free from political and strict ideological censorship . 
Although today &apos;s new political reality in Russia is creating its own new myths and falsifications , this has not extended to historians &quot; work . 
So the impartial history of the Russian Revolution that has not been written may yet be . 
Putin rarely talks about the problems of Russia &apos;s twentieth-century history , once replying to a direct question about his attitude toward the events of 1917 by saying that he considered it to be &quot; the country &apos;s natural reaction to defeat in the First World War . &quot; 
When he visited the Russian cemetery near Paris - where many central figures of the &quot; White movement &quot; and Russian emigrants are buried - Putin placed wreaths on the graves of Ivan Bunin , a Russian poet , and Vika Obolenskaya , a hero of the French resistance . 
Putin also stopped near the common gravestone of generals and officers of the &quot; White &quot; armies . 
The remains of Andrey Denikin , a &quot; white &quot; general , have recently been moved to Moscow , and the remains of Vladimir Karpel , another &quot; White &quot; general , to Irkutsk . 
A monument to Admiral Alexander Kolchak , who led the White effort to overthrow the Bolsheviks , has been erected in Irkutsk , and a monument to Nicholas II has been built in Moscow . 
Indeed , the Orthodox Church has consecrated Nicholas II a saint . 
These are steps toward the unification of a state and nation , and not attempts to gain revenge or break up Russia . 
Today , good conditions exist for calm and unbiased examination of Russia &apos;s past , from the Revolution of 1917 to the days of stagnation under Brezhnev . 
It is a moment that historians must seize .
