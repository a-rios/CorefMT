Cartography &apos;s New Golden Age 
MOUNTAIN VIEW , CALIFORNIA - Noé Diakubama , an emigrant from the Democratic Republic of Congo who now lives in Paris , is one of this century &apos;s intrepid pioneers . 
Using online mapmaking tools , he created the first map of his village , Mbandaka , which he and his wife have modified more than 100,000 times since 2009 . 
Noé literally put Mbandaka - and the people who live there - on the map . 
Noé is not the only such pioneer . 
There is a vast and growing community of online mapmakers creating useful , accessible maps of lesser-known areas - and transforming people &apos;s lives in the process . 
During the Age of Exploration , which extended from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century , adventurers like Christopher Columbus , Ferdinand Magellan , and James Cook embarked on dangerous journeys to distant lands , from New Zealand to Newfoundland , drawing detailed charts of their voyages . 
By advancing geographic knowledge , they broadened people &apos;s worldview , enhanced trade , and helped to usher in the Industrial Revolution . 
Today , people like Noé are spearheading a second golden age of cartography , which promises to bring equally significant economic and social benefits . 
Indeed , accurate maps break down geographic barriers , empowering individuals to reach their desired destinations , enabling businesses to reach consumers anywhere , and enriching people &apos;s outlooks . 
The Internet is transforming the way maps are made , enabling ordinary people - dubbed &quot; citizen cartographers &quot; - to work alongside intrepid adventurers and professional geographers . 
These cartographers - whose only common characteristic is Internet access - are embracing the opportunity to depict the places that they know and love , whether to help their neighbors get around or to give faraway people a glimpse of their local environments . 
Using online tools like Google Map Maker , they are contributing to the shared goal of building a digital map of the world . 
Some even host &quot; mapping parties , &quot; at which communities gather around computers , in schoolyards or church halls , to add layers of detail that extend beyond topography . 
By including human elements , such as popular cafés or local walking trails , they create comprehensive , useful tools for others , and enhance their understanding of their own community . 
Digital maps can be as dynamic as the communities that they depict . 
While paper maps can accurately portray static features like rivers and mountains , they cannot easily be updated when new buildings are constructed , roads are rerouted , or new restaurants open . 
By contrast , digital maps can be modified instantly , keeping locals apprised of developments in their area and helping visitors to feel like natives in unfamiliar places . 
Similarly , a digital map can be tailored to an individual &apos;s interests or needs . 
A keen cyclist might want a map showing bicycle paths , including information about the terrain . 
But a tourist might prefer a map that highlights specific attractions or indicates public-transport links . 
Such customization leads to many millions of versions of the world - all of them accurate . 
Digital mapping technology is having the most profound impact on the world &apos;s most remote and undeveloped regions . 
In Africa , for example , road coverage on Google Maps increased from 20 % in 2008 to 75 % last year , while the number of towns and villages for which detailed maps are available grew by more than 1,000 % . 
This has not only facilitated trade and transport , but also translates into faster response times for emergency services , saving thousands of lives each year . 
In fact , modern tools like maps and satellite navigation contribute to annual savings of up to 3.5 billion liters of gasoline and more than one billion hours of travel time . 
As a result , farmers are better able to get their goods to market before they perish , and to build more efficient irrigation systems , which save the global agricultural industry $ 8-22 billion annually . 
The mapping movement &apos;s growing momentum promises to result in the accurate and comprehensive representation of almost every inch of the world , including road data , photos , and business listings . 
This will create even more opportunities for economic growth , improve access to health care and other services , contribute to social development , and broaden - both figuratively and literally - people &apos;s worldview . 
To advance the world &apos;s geographic knowledge , explorers used to have to head out to sea , enduring inclement weather and debilitating disease , unsure of where they were going - or whether they would ever return home . 
While today &apos;s online cartographers do not face the same risks , they , too , are embarking on a journey into the unknown in search of knowledge , excitement , and better lives .
