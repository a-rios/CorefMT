LGBT at Work 
DAVOS - When Apple CEO Tim Cook announced last year that he is gay , I was inundated by emails and telephone messages from executives around the world . 
As an &quot; out &quot; executive at Ernst 
Young ( EY ) , everyone seemed to want to know what I thought this meant for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) inclusion on a global scale . 
Apple , after all , resides in fifth place on the Fortune 500 list of the world &apos;s largest companies . 
Was this the end of the &quot; lavender ceiling &quot; ? 
In his Bloomberg Businessweek article , Cook describes how being gay has affected him : &quot; I &apos;m proud to be gay , and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me . 
Being gay has given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the minority and provided a window into the challenges that people in other minority groups deal with every day . &quot; 
My own experience of being &quot; different &quot; is multifaceted . 
Like Cook , being in the minority informed my propensity to be an inclusive leader . 
Unlike Cook , in addition to being closeted , I was a woman and an introvert , and my politics tended to differ from those of my peers in my heavily male , extrovert-dominated profession . 
Since coming out in 2011 , I have been publicly truer to myself and more authentic with others . 
That has made me a better leader . 
And being out in a leadership position in a global organization has provided me a platform to talk openly on a wide range of issues . 
There is no question about it : Cook &apos;s announcement was a huge step forward . 
And international organizations have made considerable progress in LGBT inclusion by relying on external and employee networks and non-discrimination policies . 
But most of today &apos;s available statistics reflect progress in Europe and the United States . 
According to a recent study by the women &apos;s advocacy organization Catalyst , 62 % of Fortune 500 companies now offer health insurance to domestic partners , while 87 % of Fortune 500 companies - and 94 of the top 100 - have non-discrimination policies that include sexual orientation . 
By contrast , Todd Sears , founder of Out Leadership , an advocacy group for LGBT employees , estimates that 90 % of LGBT workers in Asia are closeted . 
In 78 countries , including Uganda and Nigeria , being gay is still illegal . 
Singapore recently upheld its stringent anti-homosexuality law . 
In Russia , on the same day Cook made his announcement , a memorial to Apple founder Steve Jobs was dismantled , ostensibly to comply with a law prohibiting &quot; gay propaganda . &quot; 
Even in the US , where members of the same sex can marry in 35 states ( as I did in New York last April ) , in 29 states it is still legal to fire someone solely on the basis of their sexual orientation . 
In 34 states , it is legal to fire a transgender employee . 
That said , multinational companies can take several steps to further their LGBT inclusion strategies on a global scale . 
For starters , they can strengthen the &quot; ally effect . &quot; 
Research conducted by the Center for Talent Innovation shows that allies - people who support LGBT colleagues or work as advocates - play a decisive role in creating an inclusive community . 
In fact , 24 % of the LGBT workers surveyed attribute their decision to come out professionally to their network of allies . 
Employers can create networks that invite straight colleagues to support their LGBT co-workers and sponsor LGBT individuals and groups . 
Likewise , senior executives being visibly out makes a huge difference . 
Cook is a great example . 
LGBT employees are 85 % more likely to be out at companies where senior executives are out ( 24 % versus 13 % ) . 
At EY , our LGBT leadership participated in the &quot; It Gets Better &quot; video project in 2011 , sharing stories for the benefit of at-risk LGBT youth . 
I took advantage of the opportunity , and , with the full support of EY &apos;s leadership , officially came out . 
I not only talked openly about my own experiences ; 
That leads to a more general point : The more people hear , see , and know about what is going on in an organization , the more quickly cultural change takes place . 
Speaking up is an important part of that , because people not only listen to what is said , but also notice what passes without being challenged . 
Too often , when an organization does not correct a misstatement , it is taken as agreement . 
Customized solutions also help . 
Companies should meet with LGBT groups at other organizations , both locally and globally , and implement policies from the more progressive regions in which they do business ( say , Europe and the US ) . 
But one size does not fit all . 
Strategies work best when they are tailored to fit the requirements of specific conditions , such as geographic locations , business unit type , or department function . 
Finally , companies should continue to facilitate an inclusive workplace for everyone , not just LGBT employees . 
That means shifting from a culture of diversity , with its implicit focus on &quot; them , &quot; to an inclusiveness-centered culture of &quot; us . &quot; 
Cook and I share many of the same attitudes about our LGBT identity . 
And I find that his announcement accords with my own experience : &quot; &#91; Being gay has &#93; made me more empathetic , which has led to a richer life . 
It &apos;s been tough and uncomfortable at times , but it has given me the confidence to be myself , to follow my own path , and to rise above adversity and bigotry . &quot; 
The lavender ceiling has been cracked , but there is nowhere in the world today where inclusiveness has been fully achieved . 
There is still much more to do .
