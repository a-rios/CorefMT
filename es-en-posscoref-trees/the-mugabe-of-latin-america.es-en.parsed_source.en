The Mugabe of Latin America 
MANAGUA - Like thousands of Nicaraguans , I voted for Managua &apos;s mayor in local elections last November . 
After the voting , the authorities of my jurisdiction posted a copy of the certificate of results on the door of the Electoral Board , which registered 155 votes for the opposition candidate , 76 votes for the candidate of the Sandinista National Liberation Front ( FSLN ) and two votes for other candidates . 
The next day , however , the results from my board were not included on the Supreme Electoral Board ( CSE ) Web site with the results of Managua , and victory was awarded to the FSLN candidate . 
It has taken months to find this out , but the same thing happened in 660 other local boards : roughly 120,000 votes - 30 % of the total - were never made public . 
If the results of these boards had been counted , the opposition would have won the capital &apos;s mayoralty by a wide margin . 
This month , the new mayors took office without the electoral commission ( CSE ) having made public 100 % of the votes , an open violation of Nicaraguan electoral law . 
Although the electoral fraud in Managua was the most widely documented , the same modus operandi occurred across the country , affecting more than 40 municipalities . 
Despite complaints from the Episcopal Conference of the Catholic Church , chambers of commerce and political parties , the CSE has refused to allow a recount of the ballots or scrutiny by impartial observers . 
And , when citizens protested peacefully , the government resorted to violence to curb them . 
Thus , the FSLN government proclaimed itself winner in 109 of the 153 municipalities . 
National and international observers were barred from monitoring the vote until the last moment . 
Ironically , the democratic opening began with Ortega , who unintentionally inaugurated an era of electoral competition when he lost power in 1990 . 
But the stolen local elections that took place last autumn have set the country back 50 years , to the time of the Somoza dictatorship . 
As a result , politics in Nicaragua is fraying dangerously once more . And the international community , which provides almost a third of the resources needed to make the country work , is being alienated . Why did Ortega decide to steal the municipal elections , despite the risks this fraud has imposed on his government ? 
The only plausible explanation is the need to clear the way for his re-election as president , whatever the cost . 
Unlike presidents Hugo Chávez in Venezuela or Evo Morales in Bolivia , who came to power by majority vote , Ortega regained Nicaragua &apos;s presidency in 2007 despite securing only 38 % of the vote in the first round of polling . 
He crossed the majority threshold only because of a pact he made with former president Arnoldo Alemán , once Ortega &apos;s rival , who was in jail at the time for corruption . 
Two years into his term , Ortega needed to win majorities in the local elections in order to impose a constitutional reform that will allow him to seek a second consecutive term . 
Had he failed to win in the capital and the country &apos;s principal cities , he would have had to recognize the failure of his authoritarian political model , which has also had no success in reducing poverty . 
So Ortega ran the risk of committing electoral fraud , and now the country is paying the price . 
The European Union has suspended $ 70 million in aid . 
The outgoing American administration froze $ 64 million of assistance , leaving a final decision on what to do to the new Obama administration . 
But , despite its international isolation and its domestic discredit , Ortega &apos;s has nonetheless renewed his pact with Alemán to preserve his misrule . 
Last month , the Supreme Court of Justice acquitted Alemán of the corruption charges that had sent him to prison for 20 years . 
An hour later , Alemán returned Ortega &apos;s favor with interest : his representatives gave Ortega &apos;s Sandinistas control of parliament , putting an end to the legislative paralysis caused by the protests against the electoral fraud . 
In allying himself with Alemán &apos;s forces , Ortega has only bought himself time to work out a response to the approaching economic disaster brought on by the world recession . 
But he has lost the battle for political legitimacy . 
Fortunately for Latin America , there is little indication that Sandinista-style electoral fraud is spreading . 
The case of Ortega - who Europeans are already calling the Mugabe of Latin America - seems , instead , to be an exception . 
And it should be remembered that Latin America &apos;s most recent electoral fraudsters - Manuel Noriega of Panama in 1989 and Alberto Fujimori in Peru in 2000 - were evicted from power before finishing their terms in office .
