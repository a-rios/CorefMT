A Future Made in Europe 
ROME - Over the last three years , the European Union , faced with the imperative of calming roiled markets and laying the foundations for a sound recovery , has concentrated largely on financial stability and reducing fiscal deficits and debt . 
Now , with financial tensions easing and confidence returning , Europe &apos;s leaders should shift their focus in 2014 back to the real economy and the industrial base . 
February &apos;s meeting of the European Council of Ministers will be a good place to start . 
To decide the best way forward , Europe &apos;s leaders should look to the past . 
Investment in manufacturing - historically one of the main drivers of growth in Europe - holds the key to revitalizing the European economy . 
Over the last decade , industrial policy has been sidelined in favor of the financial and service sectors . 
Many European countries have since undergone deindustrialization . 
Nonetheless , the industrial sector continues to play a key role in the EU economy , employing more than 34 million people and accounting for 80 % of exports , while providing a substantial share of private investment in research and development . 
Industrial manufacturing thus affects every other sector of Europe &apos;s economy , including the service sector . 
In fact , despite policymakers &quot; shift in focus and emerging-economy competition , European countries remain among the world &apos;s top performers in manufacturing , owing to the many firms that have managed to adapt and innovate . 
A similar shift toward higher-value-added manufacturing activities is occurring across the EU . 
These developments suggest that Europe &apos;s future success will depend on its ability to combine its traditional economic strengths with strong innovation . 
EU countries should be working to create the conditions that a thriving industrial sector needs . 
For example , Italy &apos;s recently launched Destinazione Italia program will help Italian companies succeed by establishing a more predictable tax system , reducing bureaucratic red tape , and ensuring more effective contract enforcement by strengthening the civil-justice system . 
Such an environment would enable firms to grow , while attracting foreign and domestic private investment . 
But national efforts alone are not enough . 
European firms are integrated into regional and global value chains . 
A component produced by a company in Brescia might go into equipment produced in Stuttgart , which might then be assembled as a final product in Malaga . 
In this context , no single country can reach its full potential unless all are successful . 
The most effective approach to restoring European competitiveness would be to combine EU member countries &quot; individual strengths , thereby forming increasingly productive European supply chains - or capturing the top positions in global supply chains . 
This would require deepening the connections among national economies and fostering a genuine , unbounded single market that integrates different countries &quot; relative strengths . 
To this end , more targeted policies at the EU level are essential . 
Remaining globally competitive will require investment in the key determinants of future industrial production : energy efficiency and technological innovation . 
Given this , the EU should pursue measures that support the competitiveness of energy-intensive industry , with a particular focus on reducing the energy-price gap with Europe &apos;s industrial competitors , such as the United States and the emerging economies . 
An efficient internal energy market is vital to the delivery of affordable energy . 
Another important initiative - a European Research Area - is already underway , and should be implemented by 2014 . 
By creating a shared agenda for national research programs and facilitating the circulation of skills and scientific knowledge - allowing , say , a top-notch center for mechanical sciences in Italy to attract researchers from Finland or Portugal - the research area promises to create an optimal environment for innovation . 
Beyond research and development , an innovation-driven industrial economy demands workers with specific , high-level skills . 
Meeting this demand requires EU policies that promote secondary , upper secondary , and higher education . 
In order to create deeper , more integrated , and more multi-dimensional markets , the EU should place a high priority on free-trade agreements , especially the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership currently being negotiated with the US . 
Such trade integration - and , eventually , a Transatlantic Common Market - could prove to be one of Europe &apos;s most effective growth mechanisms , especially for small and medium-size manufacturing firms , in the coming decades . 
European manufacturing companies also need much better access to finance . 
One of the most damaging legacies of the financial crisis has been persistent credit rationing . 
In some countries , half of all loan applications are rejected and financing costs have reached prohibitively high levels . 
There is no reason why loans in Bozen ( Bolzano ) should cost twice as much as those in nearby Innsbruck ; in fact , such arbitrary divergences merely undermine competition and cause economic stagnation . 
If EU leaders do not resolve this issue , including by pursuing a full-fledged banking union , the positive effects of reform efforts will quickly be nullified by the lack of new investment . 
Reindustrialization - together with the fight against youth unemployment - should top Europe &apos;s agenda in 2014 , with the goal of establishing an industrial sector that accounts for 20 % of GDP by 2020 . 
This will be possible only through deeper EU integration . 
Indeed , ever-closer union represents Europe &apos;s only hope of building a modern , innovative , and prosperous economy .
