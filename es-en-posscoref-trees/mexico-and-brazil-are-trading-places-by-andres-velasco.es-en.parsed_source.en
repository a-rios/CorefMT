A Tale of Two Countries 
SANTIAGO - Barely two years ago , Brazil &apos;s rapid economic growth and expanding middle class made it the darling of financial markets , whereas Mexico was better known for drug gangs and violence . 
With slow growth and stalled economic reforms , financial markets were about to write off Mexico as a lost cause . 
How quickly countries &quot; reputations can change . 
Today , the Brazilian economy is stagnating , and no amount of infrastructure investment for the World Cup and the Olympics seems able to pull it out of its rut . 
Mexico &apos;s economy , by contrast , is expanding at a steady clip , pushed along by a recent boom in industrial exports to the United States . 
So Brazil has become the star that disappoints , while Mexico is the underperformer that suddenly shines . 
What is going on ? 
For starters , financial markets &quot; behavior says more about them than it does about the countries in question . 
With analysts focused more on short-term figures than on structural trends , it is not surprising that financial markets often fail to comprehend the real story . 
That said , there are important differences in the way that Brazil and Mexico have run their economies . 
And those contrasts suggest useful lessons for other emerging countries . 
One difference is that Mexico &apos;s economy is much more open than Brazil &apos;s . 
Mexico is not only a part of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) with the United States and Canada , but also participates in a web of other agreements extending to Europe and Asia . 
Brazil &apos;s openness , by contrast , is limited by the strictures of Mercosur , a regional grouping whose commitment to growth through trade is shaky at best . 
Of course , this difference between the two countries is mostly old news . 
What is novel is our understanding of how long these differences in trade policies can take to yield appreciable gaps in economic performance . 
Back in 1994 , when NAFTA entered into force , its advocates promised that the gains in jobs and growth would come quickly . 
They did not . 
Nearly two decades had to pass before a sufficient number of firms established operations in Mexico to take advantage of access to the US market . 
Other gurus predicted that China had an overwhelming advantage and would eventually suck all trade-related jobs out of Mexico . 
They , too , were wrong . 
Jobs were lost to China in the first half of the 2000 &quot; s , but in recent years - as Chinese wages ( measured in dollars ) rose quickly - the advantages of producing in Mexico reasserted themselves . 
Mexico has also profited from the rise of just-in-time production in the US , which puts a premium on proximity and ready access to imported inputs . 
A second crucial difference lies in the two countries &quot; mix of monetary and fiscal policies . 
Mexico and Brazil both implemented anti-crisis fiscal packages in 2009 . 
But Mexico withdrew the stimulus promptly as its economy recovered , and has pursued a tighter fiscal policy than Brazil in the years since . 
This is not desirable for its own sake , as conservatives might argue , but rather for the additional scope that it creates for monetary policy . 
Mexico has been able to keep interest rates much lower - the basic policy rate is 4.5 % , compared to 7 % in Brazil ( which is unusually low for the country ) - while maintaining a lower inflation rate as well . 
Both countries are vulnerable to inflows of &quot; hot &quot; money from rich countries , but Mexico &apos;s lower interest rates have better insulated it from the resulting threat of upward exchange-rate pressure . 
Brazil &apos;s real exchange rate has appreciated considerably in the last three years ( with some ups and downs in recent months ) , while Mexico &apos;s has remained basically flat . 
And , of course , Mexico &apos;s competitive exchange rate is a key reason why it has become an export powerhouse , with the manufacturing sector accounting for 80 % of merchandise exports . 
A third crucial difference consists in how the two countries have positioned themselves in the world economy . 
Setting aside the recent African commodity boom , most economic growth has happened in three world regions with similar productive arrangements . 
In East Asia , a host of countries produce components for assembly in China ( or elsewhere in the region ) and subsequent re-export ; in Central and Eastern Europe , a similar phenomenon occurs with Germany as the hub ; and , of course , in North America , both Canada and Mexico are increasingly integrated into the US market . 
Auto parts and finished vehicles are the largest components of that shift in North America , but the story does not end there : electronics , telecommunications equipment , and many other goods are also part of the growth . 
Mexico &apos;s export basket is dramatically larger and more diverse than it was three decades ago . 
The same cannot be said of Brazil - or , indeed , of any of South America &apos;s fast-growing economies . 
These South American countries - Brazil included - ought to be thinking about what will fuel economic growth if and when the commodity boom ends . 
What new goods and services will Brazil and the others export a decade from now , and to which markets ? 
Unfortunately , the region &apos;s political and business leaders have little to say on this issue . 
Of course , we should be wary about jumping to definitive conclusions . 
In recent months , Mexican exports have been slowing , while domestic consumption is picking up as a source of demand . 
And , given Brazil &apos;s capable professionals and quality firms , its potential to sell stuff around the world , while relatively limited by its trade relationships , should not be underestimated . 
Perhaps Mexico and Brazil will one day become the northern and southern anchors of Latin American growth . 
That would give financial markets - and the citizens of the region - a genuine reason to cheer .
