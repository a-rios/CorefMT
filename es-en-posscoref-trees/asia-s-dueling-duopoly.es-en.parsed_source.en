Asia &apos;s Dueling Duopoly 
TOKYO - In today &apos;s Asia , there are two economic powers of global standing , Japan and China . 
But the balance of economic power between the two is changing , and fast . 
Sometime this year , China &apos;s GDP will exceed that of Japan ( if it has not already done so ) . 
China &apos;s economic footprint , moreover , is spreading rapidly across Asia and the rest of the world . 
Most Asian countries are recovering strongly from the global recession that set in following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 . 
China &apos;s growth rate last year was 8.7 % , and more than 10 % in the past two quarters . 
Neighboring countries , like South Korea and Singapore , also are recording very high rates of growth . 
The only exception is Japan , where a lack of political leadership and a limited knowledge of basic economics among government ministers undermines mid-term growth prospects . 
While China &apos;s ability to maintain high growth through the &quot; Lehman Shock &quot; was a remarkable feat of economic management , three important changes in China hold geo-political implications for the region and the world . 
The first change concerns China &apos;s pattern of economic growth , which so far has been achieved mostly by rapidly increasing factor inputs - labor , capital , and energy . 
According to recent research , however , about one-third of growth in China now comes from technological progress , or an increase in total factor productivity . 
In other words , China &apos;s growth pattern is coming to resemble that of industrialized economies . 
Second , the renminbi is expected to appreciate substantially in the coming years , owing not only to pressure over China &apos;s huge trade surplus , but also to the Chinese government &apos;s understanding that a stronger renminbi , despite its negative impact on exporters , is needed to fight inflation . 
The question is how rapidly will China &apos;s authorities allow the renminbi to appreciate . 
In 1989 , before the Tiananmen Square incident , the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate was 45 % higher than it is now - a level that could be re-attained relatively soon . 
Between 2003 and 2005 , the renminbi appreciated by 20 % . 
Given rapid economic growth and continuous renminbi appreciation , Chinese GDP could exceed that of the US as soon as 2015 . 
But around 2015 , China will face a third dramatic change - a demographic shift reflecting the effects of its long-standing one-child policy . 
China &apos;s total fertility rate is estimated at around 1.5 , implying that the working-age population will begin to decline by the mid-2010 &quot; s . 
As a result , economic growth will slow , and China &apos;s domestic problems - such as income inequality - will worsen , even as political institutions that can channel popular grievances remain underdeveloped . 
Under such circumstances , the role of political leadership will become much more important . 
President Hu Jintao will step down in 2013 , but will continue to hold his post on the all-important Central Military Commission until a complete succession is completed , also around 2015 . 
So , all things considered , China &apos;s looming leadership transition is shaping up to be a very challenging period for China and the world . 
While China &apos;s economy is growing very rapidly , Japan is still struggling . 
Indeed , the country desperately requires strong political leadership to prevent a Greek scenario - political leadership that it is unlikely to find . 
On the contrary , the recent resignation from the premiership of Yukio Hatoyama created more uncertainty than his own government did . 
Hatoyama &apos;s cabinet , led by his Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , ignored macroeconomic management after taking office in September 2009 . 
Instead , as the DPJ had promised its voters , the government focused on increasing spending , including huge new grants to households and farmers . 
As a result , the share of tax revenue in total spending is less than 50 % for the first time in Japan &apos;s post-war history . 
And the government debt-to-GDP ratio is around 190 % , compared to 120 % in Greece . 
Nevertheless , the market for Japanese Government Bonds ( JGBs ) has so far remained stable . 
Because JGBs are purchased mainly by domestic organizations and households , there is little risk of capital flight , despite the seriousness of the budget situation . 
In other words , the government &apos;s negative saving is being financed by the private and household sectors &quot; positive saving . 
This situation , however , is changing . 
First , the volume of JGBs has soared relative to Japanese household assets . 
Japanese households hold about Â¥ 1,100 trillion in net monetary assets , an amount that will be exceeded in about 3-5 years by the value of JGBs . 
At that point , government debt will no longer be backed up by taxpayers &quot; assets . 
And , reflecting the aging of Japanese society , the household savings rate itself will decline dramatically , making it difficult for the private sector to finance annual budget deficits . 
At the same time , Japan &apos;s demographic trends will boost demand for fiscal expenditure , as pension and health-care costs rise . 
So , sooner or later , a tax hike will be necessary . 
Without comprehensive reform under strong political leadership , a tax hike alone cannot solve Japan &apos;s problems . 
And the impact on Asia and the global economy of a fiscal crisis in Japan would make Greece &apos;s troubles look like a walk in the park . 
Greece &apos;s GDP share in the European Union is about 3 % . 
So the future in Asia now appears to belong to China , whose economic growth supports that of neighboring countries - and whose mercantilism is prevailing in the region . 
In order to compete with China &apos;s export-boosting public-private schemes , other Asian countries are now pursuing similar policies . 
In some cases , this will harm free trade , and governments should be careful to avoid measures that distort resource allocation . 
This matters for every country , because Asia is now an important center of global economic growth . 
The world &apos;s expectations for responsible economic management by the governments of both China and Japan - and thus the need for it - are growing by the day .
