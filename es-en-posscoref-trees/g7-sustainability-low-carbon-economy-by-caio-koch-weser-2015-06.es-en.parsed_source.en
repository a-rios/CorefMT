The G-7 &quot; s Sustainability Mission 
FRANKFURT - In six months , representatives from countries around the world will gather in Paris in an effort to reach a global accord to fight climate change . 
When the G-7 &quot; s leaders meet next week in Germany , they should use the occasion to take the first steps toward avoiding the most dangerous consequences of global warming . 
With the world &apos;s safety and prosperity at stake , the question is not whether or when to begin the transition to a low-carbon economy , but how to manage the effort . 
In 2014 , investments in clean energy reached a new high of $ 310 billion , after two years of decline . 
That is good news , but it is still far short of the $ 1.1 trillion per year that the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) estimates is needed in the low-carbon energy sector . 
In the meantime , some $ 950 billion was invested in oil , gas , and coal in 2013 - a figure that has doubled in real terms since 2000 . 
The value of an investment is based largely on the perception of how risky it is . 
Investment will not shift decisively toward greener sources of energy unless and until portfolio managers begin to account for the risks of dangerous climate change . 
Investors also need to consider &quot; carbon bubbles , &quot; the overvaluation of fossil-fuel companies based on the assumption that they will be able to continue burning the world &apos;s reserves until depletion . 
Until recently , traditional forms of energy production have had the advantage of being based on established and mature industries . 
But the tides are shifting . 
Sovereign wealth funds and institutional and private investors are increasingly recognizing that climate change will undermine their returns , and that governments eventually will begin to address the problem . 
Likewise , the Bank of England is undertaking important work on the risk that assets like coal or oil reserves could be &quot; stranded &quot; by policy changes intended to limit dangerous climate change . 
And the G-20 finance ministers recently requested that the Financial Stability Board undertake a broad assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities . 
The G-7 countries should clearly signal that they are serious about the low-carbon transition , and the most effective way to do that would be to support a global goal of cutting net greenhouse-gas emissions to zero by 2050 . 
In addition , governments and regulators can take concrete steps to stimulate private-sector investment in cleaner forms of energy . 
For starters , governments should take the equivalent of the Hippocratic oath and pledge to do no active harm to the planet . 
The New Climate Economy Report , released by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate , on which I serve , underlines the importance of phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies and questions the wisdom of allowing export credit agencies to finance coal projects . 
Governments must set themselves a firm four-year deadline to end fossil-fuel subsidies and redirect funding to areas like green infrastructure projects and development assistance . 
Second , governments must lead by example . 
High-level meetings in Addis Ababa and Paris later this year offer the opportunity to create synergies between the fight against climate change and financing for development and infrastructure . 
Governments should also encourage public pension funds to invest responsibly , especially when it comes to the climate . 
More , too , could be done to support the market for green bonds , including by issuing green government bonds . 
Third , governments must create policy frameworks that foster low-carbon investments . 
Putting a price on carbon is critical . 
The slow but steady progress that countries are making toward this goal is encouraging . 
In the meantime , governments should use a shadow carbon price and carbon discount rate in their decision-making processes . 
In addition , governments and regulators should adopt policies ensuring sustainable financial-sector practices , including annual reporting by companies and investors on environmental , social , and governance issues and due diligence and risk models regarding environmental hazards . 
Consideration of the possibility of stranded assets must be systematically expanded . 
Finally , policymakers should foster partnerships and new instruments that nudge the economy toward low-carbon alternatives . 
Development banks , for example , can help leverage private-sector investment . 
And new institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank are in a position to make sustainability a core mandate . 
Managing the transition from an economy based on fossil fuels to one based on low-carbon alternatives will not be easy . 
But that is why it is essential to begin today . 
It is time for the G-7 to recognize its responsibility and lead the world toward a sustainable future .
