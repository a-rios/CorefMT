Shinzo Abe &apos;s Grand Arrival 
Japan &apos;s new prime minister , Shinzo Abe , has wasted little time in making his mark , particularly in foreign policy . 
His official visits to China and South Korea - two key countries with which relations suffered under the administration of Junichiro Koizumi - came within a week of his taking office and at a moment of crisis , with North Korea setting off an underground nuclear blast . 
That Prime Minister Abe and Chinese President Hu Jintao agreed that a North Korean nuclear test &quot; cannot be tolerated &quot; suggests that this new activism may help to stabilize Asian security . 
As Abe made clear when he delivered the prime minister &apos;s general policy speech late last month , his focus on foreign policy is set to intensify . 
In particular , emphasizing a &quot; shift to more assertive diplomacy , &quot; Abe &apos;s policy speech cited Japan &apos;s initiative in proposing sanctions against North Korea to the United Nations Security Council , and its success in overseeing - through close coordination with the United States and other countries - the resolution &apos;s unanimous adoption . 
At the same time , he indicated his intention to advance diplomacy aimed at strengthening the solidarity among Asian nations , founded on &quot; the Japan-US alliance for the world and for Asia . &quot; 
Abe also stressed his intention to boost ties with Russia , promote cooperation with the ASEAN countries , and develop a strategic dialogue with Australia and India . 
Likewise , under Abe , Japan will develop its official development assistance , seek to secure stable energy supplies , and pursue permanent membership of the UN Security Council . 
Toward North Korea , on the other hand , continuity will prevail , with Abe re-emphasizing the principle that normalization of relations requires resolution of abduction cases - some dating to the 1970 &quot; s - involving Japanese citizens who were seized from coastal towns . 
At the same time , Japan will remain committed to the six-party talks on North Korea &apos;s nuclear program . 
Abe recognizes the new challenges posed by proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism , and has acknowledged the rising expectation , at home and abroad , that Japan &apos;s contribution to international security must grow . 
Most importantly , he has proposed exercising the right collective self-defense on a case-by-case basis - thus far barred by the article 9 of Japan &apos;s constitution - in order to maintain peace and promote effective functioning of the Japan-US alliance . 
Abe says that he would &quot; expect &quot; the early adoption of the referendum law needed to amend the constitution . 
Abe &apos;s choice of personnel clearly reflects his focus on diplomatic and security issues . 
Yasuhisa Shiozaki , who occupies the key position of cabinet secretary , is a long-time ally , while the foreign minister , Taro Aso , though a rival within the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , shares Abe &apos;s policy priorities . 
Akio Kyuma , the Director-General of the Defense Agency , which is expected to be transformed into the Ministry of Defense , was instrumental in preventing Aso &apos;s ally , Fukushiro Nukaga , from running for LDP president . 
Furthermore , Abe will seek to reorganize the prime minister &apos;s office to reinforce its ability to function as a political headquarters that can make quick decisions on national strategy concerning diplomatic and security issues . 
Thus , the prime minister &apos;s office will more closely resemble the US White House , which he hopes will enable both countries to communicate their intentions continuously and reliably . 
Based on his previous experience as cabinet secretary , Abe wants to create and operate a Japanese version of America &apos;s National Security Council . 
For this , he has appointed Yuriko Koike , a former cabinet member , as one of his five assistants , while one of the other four , Kyoko Nakayama , is responsible solely for the abduction issue . 
Moreover , although the current assistants &quot; authority is limited , Abe plans to submit legislation aimed at strengthening the prime minister &apos;s office , including an amendment of the cabinet law . 
This would enable the prime minister &apos;s assistants to &quot; command and instruct &quot; the relevant ministries and agencies . 
Abe &apos;s government may also review to increase the number of staff to which the assistants are entitled . 
All of this has given rise to depictions of the Abe administration as a &quot; cabinet of hawks &quot; or &quot; the buddy club &quot; Nevertheless , its popular support is the third highest since the end of World War II ( 63 % according to Asahi Shimbun , and 70 % according to Yomiuri Shimbun ) . 
This implies that Abe enjoys a strong mandate to implement his government &apos;s policies . 
If Abe is to create the &quot; beautiful country &quot; that he promised in his policy speech , he must not lose momentum in exercising strong leadership .
