Homeless at Home 
Today , the United Nations estimates that 77 million people - more than 1 % of the world &apos;s population - are displaced within their own countries , having been forced to flee their homes by armed conflicts , violence , urbanization , development , and natural disasters . 
This is more than the population of France , the United Kingdom , or Turkey . 
These people are not &quot; refugees , &quot; because they have not crossed an international border , but their experiences are often equally devastating . Today , the number of people who have been internally displaced by conflicts alone is twice that of refugees . 
With the increasing pattern of internal , rather than international , armed conflicts , and the rising regularity of extreme weather events affecting millions of people , internal displacement poses an even greater challenge to future generations . 
Uprooted from their homes and livelihoods , and traumatized by the violence or sudden disaster that forced them to flee , the displaced are often thrust into an extremely precarious future with few resources . 
Think of the 15 million Chinese displaced following the Sichuan earthquake , the more than two million Iraqis uprooted within their country &apos;s borders by sectarian and other violence , the 2.4 million displaced in Darfur , or the hundreds of thousands who have fled Mogadishu in the last year . 
In the last decade , those displaced by conflicts alone rose from 19 million to 26 million , with millions more displaced by disasters . 
The plight of these victims long went unrecognized , as governments and the international community alike failed to acknowledge their rights to protection and assistance . 
In 1998 , the UN issued Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement , which sets out these legal rights . 
Ten years on , what impact have the Principles had on displaced people &apos;s lives ? 
We have raised awareness of the plight of the displaced , brought about changes in government policies , and raised billions of dollars to respond to their basic needs . 
Humanitarian efforts continue to be strengthened , including through a new rapid funding mechanism , the UN Central Emergency Response Fund . 
But for every gain we have made , enormous difficulties still remain . 
The number of those displaced by natural disasters is rising , as the adverse effects of climate change continue to mount . 
Nine of every ten recorded disasters are now climate-related . 
As many as 50 million people around the world are estimated to be displaced each year by floods , hurricanes , tsunamis , earthquakes , and landslides . 
However sudden the initial displacement , the impact can last for generations , together with a long-term need for clean water , shelter , health care , and other basic services , as victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America in 1998 know from bitter experience . 
Nor are rich countries immune . 
Two years after Hurricane Katrina , thousands of people remain in temporary shelters . 
Moreover , violent armed groups , be they government-supported militias or rebel movements , increasingly embrace terror as a tactic to force civilians from their homes , as seen in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Somalia , Iraq , and elsewhere . 
Millions of people remain impoverished , face discrimination , and suffer long-lasting trauma even after the guns fall silent . 
Life in camps is demoralizing and ultimately dehumanizing . 
The world rightly focuses on the tragedy in Darfur , but overlooks another four million Sudanese still displaced as a result of the north-south conflict , many of whom continue to live in terrible poverty in Khartoum slums or in makeshift camps across the country , with little opportunity to re-build their lives . 
We must prevent displacement from occurring , and end it as quickly as possible . 
On the preventive front , countless lives can be saved by simple actions such as flood-proofing coastlines , or strengthening earthquake codes for hospitals and schools . 
Countries like Bangladesh and Mozambique have proven that disaster risk reduction and preparedness can be a life-saving investment . 
In conflict situations , preventing displacement primarily requires political will . 
Those who forcibly displace civilians in violation of international law must be held accountable in order to deter others in the future . 
States that are not involved in the conflict are also required to uphold the rights of the displaced , including the right to return to their homes wherever possible , and this must be addressed in peace agreements and enforced in peacekeeping mandates . 
So here &apos;s the bottom line : conflicts will continue and natural disasters are growing in frequency and intensity . 
Addressing the root causes and reducing the impact of displacement should start by heeding victims &quot; voices - their needs and wishes must be understood and their rights respected . 
The international community can help . 
Ten years after the Guiding Principles were signed , the time for excuses and inaction has run out .
