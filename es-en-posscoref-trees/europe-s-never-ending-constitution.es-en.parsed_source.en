Europe \ u0027s Never-Ending Constitution 
On October 29 , leaders of the European Union will gather in Rome to sign the Union &apos;s new Constitutional Treaty . 
Praise for the document &apos;s uniqueness will undoubtedly be heard , and in this they won &apos;t be boasting , because the EU Constitution is unlike any other constitution ever written . 
Most constitutions - including the American one - aspire to &quot; freeze history , &quot; or to set up a lasting institutional order that will resist the winds of change . 
Indeed , a constitution is by its nature an attempt to &quot; tame &quot; history , to make it follow the laws of man rather than its own logic , including unwelcome contingencies and the whims of fate . 
By contrast , the EU Constitution is written with the unspoken understanding that the institutions it is setting up are transitory , that they are far from optimal , and that it would be desirable to change them right now if political realities allowed it . 
But the realities of politics in today &apos;s Europe do not allow for the sort of document the signatories really wanted to draft , so the constitution that they did write is designed to establish a process of evolutionary change that will motivate further improvements along the way - improvement that will , it is hoped , one day obliterate the very arrangements today &apos;s EU Constitution is setting up . 
Indeed , from the start , the architects of the Union &apos;s Constitutional Treaty never seriously expected that their draft would endure in the form in which they wrote it . 
This pattern began at the start of the &apos; European project &apos; over half a century ago . 
Spillover effects from the original Coal and Steel Community of the 1950 &apos;s led to the creation of the European Economic Community , then to the European Community , and finally to the creation of the Union . 
Each step led to progressively greater integration . 
Even milestone documents such as the Single European Act and the Treaties of Maastricht , Amsterdam , and Nice , were never envisaged as achieving the kind of permanence ( or even semi-permanence ) that we normally associate with a constitution . 
The same is true of developments like the Union &apos;s common foreign and security policy or Monetary Union , with its Euro and European Central Bank . 
No sooner did one intergovernmental conference produce a &quot; settlement &quot; than the wheels started turning to prepare for a successor conference and a successor settlement . 
This mechanism for the deliberately progressive construction of a unified polity out of nominally sovereign states is unprecedented in human history . 
When nations embark on a program of ever closer integration , the end result is always likely to look unfinished if they put aside - on an ongoing basis - any resolution of the ultimate destination . 
Indeed , the only thing that seemed clear from the start of the European integration process was that the states involved - along with whatever new partner states they might pick up along the way - would continue wheeling and dealing to construct their ever more integrated polity . 
As a result , every set of treaty amendments was the product of the type of untidy political haggling typical of intergovernmental decision-making . 
Indeed , even under the Constitutional Treaty , all states know that their partners have the express right to withdraw if they should ever become sufficiently disenchanted or come to look upon the EU as a bad bargain . 
But will the Union &apos;s new Constitutional Treaty put an end to this pattern of evolutionary constitution building ? 
It may do so to some degree , but not nearly as much as if the treaty &apos;s architects had done more to separate constitutional matters , such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the competences of Union bodies and member states , from the stuff of everyday politics , like agricultural and fisheries policies or the technicalities of judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters . 
A great opportunity to segregate what is permanent and durable ( i.e. , &quot; constitutional &quot; ) about the Union from what is impermanent and changeable ( i.e. , &quot; political &quot; ) was missed . 
With nothing set in concrete , Europe &apos;s constitutional process continue to rely not on any transcendent document , but on balancing political relations and calculations so that the whole thing does not fall apart . 
This process will probably carry the cost of prolonging the emergence of a single European political loyalty ( if one ever does emerge ) . 
This will be considered tragic only for those who see a stable European federation as Europe &apos;s manifest destiny . 
For the rest of us , notwithstanding the Union &apos;s unprecedented eastward enlargement , the schisms that erupted over the Iraq war , and the other frictions that are bound to result from Europe &apos;s flexible , evolutionary approach to constitution-making , there is also a lot of hope in this extended struggle for self-definition . 
The recent collective sense across Europe of the urgency of being able to speak with one voice in external affairs may provide the next breeze , and enough glue , to keep the enterprise afloat .
