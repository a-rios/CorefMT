Hot Rocks 
CANBERRA - Ask any power system engineer about renewable energy and you are likely to be told that it doesn &apos;t deliver &quot; base-load &quot; power . 
In other words , renewable energy can &apos;t be relied upon to provide power 24 hours a day , seven days a week : wind doesn &apos;t always spin the turbines on the hill , the sun cannot shine on solar power stations at night , and even hydroelectricity can run short if the rains don &apos;t come . 
The inherently erratic behavior of the major renewable energy technologies presents serious problems for power system planners . 
It limits how much of these types of renewable power can usefully be fed into the world &apos;s electricity grids . 
After all , consumers expect power always to be available . 
The engineering solution is to keep a large amount of reliable base-load power as a major component of the generating mix and supplement this with &quot; peaking plants &quot; that can be brought on-line when needs arise . 
This peaking capacity is built around hydroelectric systems in some countries , but usually it is based on burning fossil fuels such as gas , diesel , or fuel oils . 
The base-load power , too , is predominantly based on fossil fuels , with around 39 % of global electricity generation sourced from burning coal . 
In some countries , nuclear power has been seen as an answer , but deposits of high-grade nuclear fuel worldwide appear to be limited , and the long-term costs of waste storage and plant decommissioning are high . 
The challenge , then , is to reduce our current reliance on fossil and nuclear fuels for base-load power . 
The answer may be under our feet . 
Earth is an extraordinarily hot planet . 
Six thousand kilometers below the surface , the planet &apos;s core is as hot as the surface of the sun . 
Yet , even at shallow depths , useful temperatures for power generation are often available . 
This &quot; conventional &quot; geothermal energy has been used to generate reliable base-load electricity for more than 100 years , and is now used in many countries including Italy , Iceland , Japan , New Zealand , and the western United States . 
The technology is well established , and the track record of reliable power generation includes more than 9000 megawatts of generating capacity . 
But conventional geothermal power requires a natural source of large quantities of steam or hot water , and such sources are usually found only in volcanic regions , which rules out its use in large parts of the world . 
More tantalizing for humanity &apos;s need for widely available , clean base-load power is the non-conventional geothermal energy called &quot; hot dry rocks , &quot; or HDR . 
With HDR , useful heat is present in rocks only a few kilometers below the Earth &apos;s surface . 
But , with no natural steam or hot water to bring the energy to the surface , an engineered solution is needed , and , during the past 35 years , more than $ 600 million has been spent worldwide devising one . 
The concept is beguilingly simple : drill at least two boreholes five kilometers deep , inject cold water into one , pass it through the hot rocks , and then bring it back to the surface , where the energy is removed in a power station . 
Then re-inject the now cooled water for another pass through the subsurface . 
Only the heat is extracted at the surface , and everything else that is brought up to the surface is re-injected again , eliminating waste . 
But it is the economics of HDR geothermal that will eventually determine its long-term role , because deep boreholes are expensive to drill , and their costs must be met before power stations can begin to generate electricity . 
The shallower the heat resources and the cheaper the capital , the more competitive an HDR project will be . 
The rising costs of fossil and fissile fuels will also make HDR more compelling , since the long-term economics of geothermal power is effectively quarantined from fuel price movements . 
Deposits of hot dry rocks are common , and large amounts of heat are within reach in many places . 
But the science and engineering of HDR has been challenging , and it is only now that the first power stations are emerging . 
A small power station is operating in Landau , Germany , and others are under construction in France and Australia . 
These first power stations will develop the operational and financial performance histories that will be necessary before HDR geothermal energy can begin making an impact on world energy supplies . 
Re-engineering humanity &apos;s power systems is going to be an expensive undertaking , regardless of what mix of technologies are used , and the chosen systems will have to be reliable and widely available . 
The road to HDR geothermal energy has been long and expensive , but , like all developing technologies , the basic research and development had to be done before commercial development could follow . 
With power stations now being built , the signs are bright for widespread use of geothermal energy to generate clean , emissions-free base-load power .
