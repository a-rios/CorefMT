Facebook Faces Down Putin 
PARIS - On December 20 , Russia &apos;s government requested that Facebook block a page used to rally opponents of President Vladimir Putin . 
Facebook initially agreed , but allowed a new page to be opened the next day . 
By demonstrating that at least some Western companies care about values that cannot be expressed on their bottom line , Facebook undermined a key claim of Russian propaganda - and thereby cast doubt on other false assertions that are helping to prop up Putin &apos;s regime . 
This was no easy decision for Facebook . 
By refusing to comply with the Kremlin &apos;s request , Facebook openly defied a Russian law allowing Internet censorship . 
As a result , the government can simply ban Facebook in Russia , where it has a formidable - and now fully loyal - local competitor , VKontakte . 
When VKontakte &apos;s founder , Pavel Durov , refused to cooperate with the government last year , he was forced to resign from the company , sell his stake , and leave the country . 
It is not difficult to discern why the Kremlin would take a single Facebook page so seriously . 
With Putin &apos;s foreign-policy misadventures wreaking havoc on Russia &apos;s economy - on a scale that not even the most pessimistic observers anticipated - any challenge to his leadership is perceived as a serious threat . 
Russia &apos;s economic decline is accelerating . 
But collapsing oil prices , together with tough economic sanctions imposed by the US and Europe , meant that by the end of the month , the government was predicting a 4 % decline in GDP and a budget deficit of 3.5 % of GDP - and that after budget cuts worth 1 % of GDP . 
Based on these figures , it is estimated that , by the end of this year , Russia will spend 70 % of the Reserve Fund accrued over the last decade or so , when oil prices were high . 
If low oil prices persist , and Western economic sanctions remain in place , Russia will run out of cash by the end of 2016 . 
Nonetheless , Putin &apos;s approval rating remains at around 80 % . 
Given his strategy &apos;s evident economic bankruptcy - exemplified by double-digit inflation and the ruble &apos;s unprecedented volatility - his supporters may seem irrational . 
In fact , the poll numbers are a testament to the power of the Kremlin &apos;s propaganda machine , which has achieved its goal of convincing Russians that regime change would bring political chaos and further economic turbulence . 
Propaganda is so critical to the regime &apos;s survival that spending on government-run media actually rises amid economic strife . 
Of course , propaganda would lose its impact if ordinary Russians were exposed to alternate solutions and perspectives . 
That is why those who defy the regime or offer convincing alternatives to Putin must be repressed and their ideas censored - everywhere , including social media . 
The Facebook page was created to mobilize supporters to protest the prosecution of the anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny , a leading opposition figure , on trumped-up fraud charges . 
The rally would be held on January 15 - the day the verdict was scheduled to be announced . 
A massive 33,000 people promised on Facebook to participate . 
This would not be the first time Russians took to the streets in support of Navalny . 
In 2013 , some 10,000 people protested when Navalny received a five-year prison sentence after being convicted of equally trumped-up charges . 
Navalny was released the next morning . 
A couple of months later , Navalny ran for Mayor of Moscow , receiving 27 % of the vote - almost enough to force the incumbent , who enjoyed support from the state-run media and virtually unlimited funds , into a runoff . 
That election proved that the opposition could credibly challenge the regime at the polls , strengthening the Kremlin &apos;s belief that people like Navalny should remain under house arrest - and be denied access to the media and the Internet . 
Thus , the Russian government blocked Navalny &apos;s blog and launched new investigations of him and his colleagues . 
It illegally prohibited his Party of Progress from participating in elections . 
The robust show of support for Navalny on Facebook scared the Kremlin . 
But , within just a few hours , about 15,000 people joined a new protest page for December 30 - despite New Year vacations , the short notice , and frigid weather . 
The government took fright again , giving Navalny a suspended sentence , rather than a real prison term , in the hope of preventing further unrest . 
It did , however , hand a three-and-a-half-year prison term to Navalny &apos;s brother , Oleg . 
The verdict was not particularly successful in assuaging the protesters , several thousand of whom staged an anti-Putin demonstration in Moscow . 
Navalny himself broke house arrest to join his supporters , but was swiftly detained - along with more than 100 of the protesters . 
The impact of the Facebook-assisted mobilization should not be underestimated . 
Had the government not feared further popular unrest , Navalny might be going to prison for the next decade , with his brother spending up to eight years there with him . 
But it is not just the protesters who made a difference . 
This is also the message of the sanctions regime , which Western governments have pursued despite its considerable economic costs . 
One hopes that , by exposing the flaws in this key message of Russian propaganda , Facebook &apos;s principled decision shows Russians that there is , in fact , a credible alternative to Putin - one that they should pursue .
