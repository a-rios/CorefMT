Central Banks on the Offensive ? 
FRANKFURT - It looks like a coordinated offensive : on September 6 , the European Central Bank outlined a new bond-buying program , letting markets know that there were no pre-set limits to its purchases . 
On September 13 , the United States Federal Reserve announced that in the coming months it would purchase some $ 85 billion of long-term securities per month , with the aim of putting downward pressure on long-term interest rates and supporting growth . 
Finally , on September 19 , the Bank of Japan declared that it was adding another ¥ 10 trillion ( $ 128 billion ) to its government securities purchase program , and that it expected its total holdings of such paper to reach about $ 1 trillion by end-2013 . 
There is , indeed , room for such concerted action , as the outlook for all three economies has deteriorated significantly . 
In the eurozone , GDP will certainly decline in 2012 , and forecasts for next year are mediocre at best . 
In the US , output continues to expand , but at a moderate 2 % pace ; and , even leaving aside the fiscal cliff looming at the end of the year , when Congress will be forced to impose spending cuts and allow tax cuts enacted in 2001 to expire , recovery remains at risk . 
In Japan , the global slowdown and a stronger yen are hitting the export sector , growth is flagging , and inflation is close to zero again . 
The reality , however , is that there is no common stance , let alone a common plan . 
In the strongest of the three economies , the Fed is willingly risking inflation by pre-announcing its intention to keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels &quot; at least through mid-2015 . &quot; 
In the weakest of the three , by contrast , the ECB has no intention of boosting growth through quantitative easing or interest-rate pre-commitments . 
On the contrary , the ECB is adamant that the only aim of its &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; ( OMT ) program , which will buy distressed eurozone members &quot; government paper , conditional on agreed reforms , is to contain the currency-redenomination risk that contributes to elevated interest rates in southern European economies . 
The goal is to restore a degree of homogeneity within the euro area in terms of the transmission of monetary policy . 
All of its asset purchases will be sterilized , meaning that their monetary-policy effects will be offset . 
Furthermore , given the controversy that its announcement of the OMT program has incited in Germany - not least with the Bundesbank - the ECB would certainly be discouraged from pursuing any Fed-like effort to push for lower interest rates along the yield curve . 
To ward off an offensive by German ( and other ) monetary hawks , who maintain that the ECB has opened the door to debt monetization , the Bank is bound to err on the side of orthodoxy in the coming months . 
The more its unconventional initiatives to repair the euro are contested , the more orthodox the ECB will be in its conduct of monetary policy . 
This discrepancy between the US and Europe is not good news . 
For the eurozone , it implies a strong exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar ( and , by implication , the yen , as the Bank of Japan closely monitors the yen-dollar exchange rate ) . 
But countries in southern Europe , especially Spain , need the support of a weak currency to rebalance externally and return to current-account surpluses . 
Absent this helping hand from the exchange rate , all southern European rebalancing will need to take place internally through domestic deflation , which in turn risks jeopardizing their return to public-debt sustainability . 
So the way out of the European conundrum - currency depreciation - risks being blocked by the market &apos;s perception that the ECB and the Fed are at odds over monetary policy . 
True , crises in problem countries and doubts about the euro &apos;s viability could weigh on the common currency &apos;s value . 
But it is worrying that the solution to Europe &apos;s internal imbalances hinges on the continued unfavorable perception of the eurozone &apos;s ability to address its problems . 
Seen from the rest of the world , things are not much better . 
Guido Mantega , the Brazilian finance minister , was quick to dismiss the Fed &apos;s stance , again warning of &quot; currency wars . &quot; 
This reading overlooks the fact that currencies throughout the emerging world ought to appreciate vis-à-vis those of the advanced economies , simply because the emerging countries do not face the same economic challenges . 
The US , Europe , and Japan are all burdened by high levels of public and private debt , and are caught in long , painful , and hazardous deleveraging cycles that render recoveries feeble and vulnerable . 
By contrast , emerging economies suffer from a downturn , but their situation is fundamentally sounder , which should be reflected in the value of their currencies . 
Unfortunately , the combination of aggressive easing in the US and a much more guarded attitude in Europe obfuscates the message . 
It suggests that the issue for the global economy is that the US is trying to find a way to inflate its problems away . 
That may be true , but it should not be permitted to obscure the underlying structural problem that the world economy is facing . 
The recent moves by the ECB , the Fed , and the BoJ look like concerted action . 
Sadly , just the opposite is true .
