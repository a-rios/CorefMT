Genetic Property Rights on Trial 
LONDON - In early February 2010 , a United States federal district court in New York began deciding a landmark case as to whether individuals have a &quot; right to know &quot; about how their own genomes can dictate their future health . 
The case , American Civil Liberties Union v. Myriad Genetics , may have a tremendous impact on medicine and science . 
The questions on which the case turns are whether genetic patents help or hamper research , and whether patients should have to pay a license fee to a biotechnology corporation to be tested for predisposition to disease . 
One of the plaintiffs is Lisbeth Ceriani , a 43-year-old woman with breast cancer whose doctors recommended that she be tested for two genetic mutations involved in some hereditary forms of the disease . 
Myriad Genetics , the sole test provider in the US - it holds a patent on the genes themselves , not just on the diagnostic test - did not accept her insurance , and Ceriani could not afford to pay for the test . 
So she remained ignorant , as did her physicians - with possible ramifications for her clinical care . 
Five other plaintiffs - along with major medical bodies - tell similar stories . 
Those who oppose genetic patents claim that they also deny US constitutional rights , making this the first time a genetic patent has been challenged on human rights grounds . 
As so often happens in biotechnology , what looks at first like an abstruse technical issue raises many questions that cut to the core of our humanity . 
One human gene out of approximately every five is now the subject of a patent , the majority of which are held by private firms . 
This case concerns two such genes , BRCA1 and BRCA2 . 
Women with the &quot; wrong &quot; version of these genes have a heightened risk of developing breast cancer ( up to 85 % , against the normal 12 % , although the genes account for only a minority of breast cancers ) . 
These women also run a greater risk of ovarian cancer . 
Myriad Genetics also has tried to pursue patent rights in Europe , but there its claims have been largely rejected . 
Although the gene &apos;s function in causing breast and ovarian cancer was uncovered by Cancer Research UK in 1995 , Myriad , along with nearly 30 other defendants , argues that the patent is a necessary reward for its research costs . 
In fact , without patent protections , the firm and its allies claim , medical research would shudder to a halt . 
But , whatever the merits of the claim that genetic patents benefit research and treatment , that is a practical , rather than a legal , argument . 
In order to gain legal &quot; standing &quot; to sue Myriad Genetics , critics of genetic patents - including the American Medical Association , the American Society of Human Genetics , and the American Civil Liberties Union - had to find an issue that could be adjudicated on a constitutional basis . 
Their innovative strategy is to draw on the First Amendment , which protects freedoms such as speech and religion , to argue that patents restrict patients &quot; freedom of access to information that might enable us to take action to protect our health . 
That is a clever argument , but is it really the source of people &apos;s profound disquiet about genetic patenting ? 
In talking about similar issues raised in my recent book Body Shopping , I have heard many shocked reactions to the growing commodification of human tissue , but none more generally shared than this one : how can you take out a patent on life ? 
Is a genetic variant a &quot; product of nature &quot; or a &quot; discovery &quot; ? 
While the plaintiffs assert that &quot; genes are identified , not invented , &quot; the defendants claim that the basis of patent law is precisely the opposite . 
Their argument is that what is patented is not the gene as it occurs in our bodies , but rather a sort of &quot; cloned &quot; version produced in the laboratory . 
Rather than a &quot; patent on life , &quot; the companies say , they are patenting something more like a chemical . 
If that is true , how can Ceriani rightfully be kept in the dark about what form the gene takes in her body ? 
This is not just a problem for people who think - wrongly , in legal terms - that they own their bodies , as most people do . 
With a few limited and recent exceptions , there is no such thing as property in tissue once it has left your body . 
We know that from such cases as that of John Moore , who tried unsuccessfully to claim property rights in a valuable cell line developed from his immune cells . 
But what about a gene that has not left my body ? 
Don &apos;t I somehow still &quot; own &quot; it ? 
Don &apos;t I have rights of control over my own body ? 
How can a commercial firm not only deny me the right to know my own genetic profile unless I pay their fee for the diagnostic test , which might be fair enough , but also to prevent any other firm from offering me a similar test unless those firms pay it a license fee ? 
Proprietary rights for commercial firms over the most basic element of an individual &apos;s genetic identity should not be enforceable . 
We do not have to believe in genetic determinism to find that argument compelling .
