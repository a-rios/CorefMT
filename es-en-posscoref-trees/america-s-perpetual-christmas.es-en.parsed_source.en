America &apos;s Perpetual Christmas 
Has the United States transcended the laws of economics ? 
As the New Year begins , the US continues to race ahead of its rich-country counterparts . 
The gargantuan US trade deficit ? 
No problem . 
In 2005 , it widened further , and the dollar only strengthened . 
Low investment and a deteriorating primary education system ? 
Not to worry . 
The super-flexible US economy keeps managing to produce more with less . 
Nor are there any signs of America &apos;s economic hegemony starting to fold under the weight of maintaining its unilateral military dominance . 
Instead of feeling the pinch of wartime privations , like in any ordinary country , American consumers are binging as if it were Christmas all year round . 
There are those who truly believe in the idea that America is exceptional . 
Those true believers argue that America &apos;s consumers can long pursue their spendthrift ways because their country &apos;s economy is better than everyone else &apos;s . 
The US labor market is more flexible than Europe &apos;s , enabling it to react more nimbly to the ever shifting sands of globalization . 
And , unlike most countries , especially in Latin America and Asia , the US system ruthlessly prunes weak corporate leadership . 
Moreover , the true believers cite America &apos;s better-funded and hyper-competitive university system , which sucks in a disproportionate share of the world &apos;s top students and researchers . 
Many ultimately choose to immigrate to America permanently , and it is relatively easy for them to do so , thanks to a society that still welcomes outsiders with open arms ( even if things have become more difficult since 2001 ) . 
On top of all this , the US military , rather than being a burden , feeds the country &apos;s technological superiority by subsidizing basic research . 
By contrast , skeptics hold that the US economy already contains the seeds of its own socio-economic decline . 
They point to worsening income inequality , as images beamed worldwide from post-hurricane New Orleans illustrated all too clearly . 
Poor children do not have reasonable access to health care . 
Nor are the non-poor faring particularly well , as wage growth has remained virtually flat for a very long time , even as corporate profits are booming . 
Indeed , this disconnect may explain why polls do not give President Bush the credit for economic management that his strong record would seem to merit . 
Nor does it help Americans &quot; mood that they spend far more of their lives working than do citizens in Europe or , these days , even Japan . 
All of these factors place deep stresses on the social fabric which , so the skeptics argue , will ultimately play out in the political arena . 
Interestingly , both sides cite America &apos;s gaping trade deficit - believe it or not , the US is soaking up two-thirds of global excess saving - to support their arguments . 
The true believers view the deficits as evidence that the world recognizes how special the US is and wants to buy in . 
Skeptics see an empire living on borrowed money and borrowed time . 
So which is it ? 
In my view , those who think that America is about to collapse are likely to be disappointed . 
Nevertheless , I suspect that the age of American exceptionalism is near an end , and soon per capita income in Europe and Japan will approach that of the US , rather than falling farther behind . 
Though the next few years are likely to underscore some of the weaknesses that the skeptics highlight , the end will come mainly because other countries will find creative ways to mimic the most effective US institutions , albeit within their own legal , political , and social frameworks . 
We would do well to recall how , at the beginning of the 1990 &quot; s , book after book was still being written urging US and European corporations to imitate Japan or face certain doom . 
The last 15 years have of course revealed deep flaws in Japan &apos;s financial system . 
But another major factor contributing to Japan &apos;s decline was that firms elsewhere began adopting Japanese methods , such as just-in-time supply chains . 
Surely , imitation will someday impinge on superior US growth performance as well . 
Perhaps the biggest weakness in the true believers &quot; argument is the trade deficit . 
For the moment , America &apos;s ability to borrow vast sums at low interest rates acts like a huge dose of steroids on the economy . 
It artificially props up consumption growth and allows the government to defer hard choices between taxes and military expenditures . 
At some point , the party is going to end . 
The unwinding of the US economy might even begin in 2006 , particularly if Japan continues to grow out of its doldrums , the US housing market softens dramatically , and Europe &apos;s economic recovery accelerates . 
Individually , these are each highly plausible scenarios , and collectively they would hit the US trade deficit like a perfect storm . 
Perhaps the end will come in a different way , but it is difficult to imagine the age of US exceptionalism lasting indefinitely . 
Can the end come abruptly in 2006 ? 
This is not the most likely scenario , but it is not unthinkable .
