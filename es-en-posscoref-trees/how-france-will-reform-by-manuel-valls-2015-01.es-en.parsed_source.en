How France Will Reform 
PARIS - The world is changing rapidly - and it will not wait for anyone . 
The only way to thrive is to keep pace with this transformation . 
That is why France is pursuing reforms . 
Of course , reform means change . 
But it does not mean giving in to external pressure , or giving up what makes France French . 
Rather , it is the key to consolidating our history , our pride , our traditions , our way of life , and our values in a dynamic global environment , for the sake of today &apos;s citizens and tomorrow &apos;s . 
It is the key to building a stronger , more prosperous France . 
Clearly , much is at stake in the ongoing reform process . 
The good news is that many factors work in France &apos;s favor , including diverse geography , a vibrant science and technology sector , a rich culture , and vast human capital . 
Indeed , these factors help to explain why France remains the world &apos;s fifth-largest economy . 
But , as globalization transforms the world economy , France must adapt in order to enable its businesses to compete abroad as well as at home . 
A robust business sector is decisive in an open economy , as it shapes a country &apos;s ability to preserve - and improve - its citizens &quot; living standards . 
That is why everything possible must be done to enable France to create more and better wealth . 
By helping French businesses recover lost margins , we can empower them to invest and create employment . 
That is precisely what the &quot; responsibility pact , &quot; which came into force on January 1 , and the tax credit for encouraging competitiveness and jobs aim to do . 
As we help French businesses to expand abroad , we must also work to encourage inward foreign investment . 
Both are key to a country &apos;s commercial attractiveness - among the most important dimensions of global competition . 
This stronger France will tackle whatever challenges the world throws at it head on . 
At the same time , it will demonstrate its capacity to eliminate drags on creativity and wealth creation . 
The &quot; law on growth and activity &quot; that will be voted on this year will unleash the business sector &apos;s energy , including by stimulating competition . 
Moreover , opening up regulated professions will help to reduce the inequalities with which the French public has become increasingly frustrated . 
To create more wealth in an open economy is one of my government &apos;s priorities . 
But more wealth alone will not cure France &apos;s ills . 
The most successful countries are those where employers and employees feel bound to a common fate . 
It is thus urgent to improve social dialogue and bolster trust in France . 
This objective underlies our &quot; simplification schemes &quot; for negotiation and consultation in the business sector . 
And it is helping to guide vocational education and training reform , which will benefit not only those who wish to enhance their skills at work , but also those whose lack of training is preventing them from finding employment . 
These initiatives are just part of a broader shift . 
Through a variety of mechanisms , we are working to make citizens &quot; lives easier , streamline business activities , and relieve the authorities of extraneous work that diverts attention from important strategic tasks . 
French citizens will soon begin to feel the impact of these efforts in their daily lives . 
Despite the tremendous potential of these initiatives , they will be for naught if they are not perceived as being fair . 
France , after all , has long been defined by a strong egalitarian impulse . 
Consider education . 
In reworking our &quot; priority education &quot; program , we can adjust teaching methods to address school inequalities , while channeling additional resources to disadvantaged areas . 
This includes ensuring that all schools have enough computers , so that all students can benefit from today &apos;s technological breakthroughs , with no digital divide among students or regions . 
The fact that the impact will not be felt for years should not be allowed to diminish its urgency . 
Indeed , the entire process of building a strong and equitable economy should aim not just to improve citizens &quot; lives today ; it must also prepare France for the future . 
And , when it comes to boosting a country &apos;s long-term prospects , the most successful initiatives often take time to produce visible results . 
In a society that overvalues immediacy , it can be difficult to take a long-term view . 
But my government will not be deterred from forward-thinking action that will ensure that tomorrow &apos;s France is the France our citizens want and deserve . 
It is up to the state to set an example for reform . 
This is all the more true in France , where citizens place high expectations on the state - not to do everything , but certainly to draw strategic lines and enable local actors to succeed . 
In short , the government must put its agenda-setting power at the service of the people . 
When it comes to preparing for the future , one exceptionally large project lies ahead : the energy transition . 
We all know that we are headed toward a new growth model - one that is more sober and sustainable , that depends less on fossil fuels and more on renewable energy sources . 
This new approach to growth will entail new habits , new attitudes , and new modes of living . 
With the energy transition law , my government aims to get ahead of this trend by creating the legislative framework for future &quot; green &quot; growth . 
The goals of the French government &apos;s reform agenda are clear : A stronger France , able to thrive in a rapidly changing global environment ; a fairer France , without which no effort , whether individual or collective , could be considered a success ; and a more steadfast France that can serve as a stable and prosperous home for our children . 
In the interest of France and its people , we are committed to the reforms needed to realize this vision .
