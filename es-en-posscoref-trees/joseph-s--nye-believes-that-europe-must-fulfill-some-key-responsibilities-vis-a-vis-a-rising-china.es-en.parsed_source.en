The Old World &apos;s New Roles 
CAMBRIDGE - China &apos;s rise has raised many questions for the West , with some wondering whether it is set to usurp a struggling Europe &apos;s global leadership role . 
As one columnist put it , &quot; there is nothing much European governments can do in East Asia , save serve as marketing managers for their domestic businesses . &quot; 
With neither the diplomatic weight nor the military heft to make an impression in the region , Europe had better leave the heavy lifting to the United States . 
For Europe , the implications of China &apos;s rise are far-reaching , beginning with the United States &quot; strategic &quot; pivot &quot; toward Asia . 
After more than 70 years as a top US priority , Europe is beginning to lose its privileged position in the eyes of American policymakers . 
Moreover , European sales of high-tech dual-use products that complicate America &apos;s security role in Asia is bound to create friction . 
Nonetheless , warnings that the Atlantic partnership is eroding are unduly dire . 
Tellingly , US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration has replaced the term &quot; pivot , &quot; which implies a turn away from something , with &quot; rebalancing . &quot; 
This change reflects a recognition that China &apos;s increasing economic dominance does not negate the importance of the European Union , which remains the world &apos;s largest economic entity and a leading source of economic innovation , not to mention values like the protection of human rights . 
This is not to say that Asia &apos;s rise will not demand adjustments . 
When the Industrial Revolution began , Asia &apos;s share of the global economy began to decline from more than 50 % to just 20 % by 1900 . 
By the second half of this century , Asia is expected to recover its former economic dominance - that is , account for 50 % of global output - while lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty . 
This power shift - perhaps the most consequential of the twenty-first century - implies serious risks . 
Historians often warn that the fear and uncertainty generated by the emergence of new powers like China can trigger serious conflict , like that which Europe experienced a century ago , when Germany overtook the United Kingdom in industrial production . 
With Asia riven by territorial disputes and historical tensions , maintaining a stable security balance will not be easy . 
In the 1990s , when US President Bill Clinton &apos;s administration was considering how to respond to China &apos;s increasing economic might , some urged a policy of containment . 
Clinton rejected that advice : It would have been impossible to forge an anti-China alliance , given the enduring desire of China &apos;s neighbors to maintain good relations with it ; more important , such a policy would have guaranteed future enmity with China . 
Instead , Clinton chose a policy that could be called &quot; integrate and insure . &quot; 
While China was welcomed into the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , America revived its security treaty with Japan . 
If China pursues a &quot; peaceful rise , &quot; its neighbors will focus on building strong economic relationships with it . 
If it throws its weight around - which some say is implied by its recent actions on the Indian border and in the East and South China Seas - its neighbors will seek to balance its power , with an American naval presence offering backup . 
Where does Europe fit into this picture ? 
For starters , it should monitor and restrain sensitive exports to avoid making the security situation more dangerous for the US . 
Furthermore , Europe can contribute to the development of the norms that shape the security environment . 
For example , Europe can play an important role in reinforcing a universal interpretation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , rather than China &apos;s idiosyncratic version - especially given that the US has not even ratified the treaty . 
Contrary to the claims of some analysts , China is not a revisionist state like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union , eager to overthrow the established international order . 
Indeed , it is not in China &apos;s interest to destroy international institutions - such as the United Nations , the WTO , and the International Monetary Fund - that have helped to facilitate its rise . 
Given Europe &apos;s leading roles in such institutions , it can help China gain the multilateral legitimacy that it seeks , in exchange for responsible behavior . 
Though China is not attempting to upend the global order , it is now undergoing a profound - and destabilizing - transformation . 
With the rise of transnational issues like climate change , terrorism , pandemics , and cyber crime - brought about by rapid technological progress and social change - power is being diffused not among states , but among a wide range of non-governmental entities . 
Addressing these challenges will require broad international cooperation , with China , the US , and Europe each playing an important role . 
Finally , there is the question of values . 
Europe , together with the US , has already resisted Chinese ( and Russian ) demands for greater Internet censorship . 
While it is impossible to predict how Chinese politics will evolve , other countries &quot; experiences suggest that political change often occurs when per capita income reaches roughly $ 10,000 . 
If such change does occur , Europe will have an opening to promote its core values even more effectively . 
Whether China &apos;s economic interest in an impartial world order based on the rule of law will lead to greater protection of individual rights remains to be seen . 
Only China will decide that .
