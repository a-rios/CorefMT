Financial Stars Behind Bars ? 
CHICAGO - Hardly a day goes by without a settlement between a bank and a US government agency or regulator . 
The latest one is between Bank of America and the government-backed mortgage underwriter Fannie Mae : $ 3.55 billion in cash ; $ 6.75 billion in repurchases of bad mortgages that Countrywide , later acquired by BoA , sold to Fannie ; and an additional $ 1.3 billion in cash to resolve Fannie &apos;s servicing issues with BoA . 
And yet , as in most settlements , BoA did not admit any fault . 
Was BoA tripped up by bad luck or sloppiness ? 
Or did it and other financial institutions behave with intent to defraud investors ? 
As a result of the settlement , we will never learn the truth ( at least the version that is established beyond a reasonable doubt in open court ) . 
In each settlement , the investigations are stopped , and whatever has been found is sealed . 
Fortunately , academic research may be able to shed some light on this important matter . 
In a recent paper , the economists Tomasz Piskorski , Amit Seru , and James Witkin compare the characteristics of securitized mortgages as they were disclosed to investors at the time of sale with these loans &quot; characteristics as they were recorded in the banks &quot; proprietary databases . 
The data cover non-agency residential mortgages , which are not the same as those targeted by the settlement , and the data come from a pool of banks , so we do not know which banks were present . 
But their data are similar enough to enable us to learn a lot about what was going on . 
If the massive wave of defaults on securitized mortgages was purely the result of bad luck , we would expect that the characteristics reported to investors would not differ from those recorded in the banks &quot; databases . 
This is especially true of characteristics that are relevant to default risk , such as whether the borrower was an owner or an investor , or whether there was a second lien on the property . 
In fact , the authors find that more than 6 % of mortgage loans misreport the borrower &apos;s occupancy status , while 7 % do not disclose second liens . 
Of course , any database contains errors . 
Are these errors large enough to be worrisome ? 
And how can we be sure that the banks knowingly misrepresented this information , rather than that they merely were sloppy in reporting it ? 
The authors provide some interesting evidence in this context . 
They show , for example , that the misrepresentation is correlated with higher defaults down the line : delinquent payments on misreported loans are more than 60 % higher than on loans that are otherwise similar . 
Thus , the errors do not seem to be random , but purposeful . 
What the authors do not find is also interesting . 
The degree of misrepresentation seems to be unrelated to the incentives provided to the top management and to the quality of risk-management practices inside these firms . 
In fact , all reputable intermediaries in their sample exhibit a significant degree of misrepresentation . 
Thus , the problem does not seem to be limited to a few bad apples , but is pervasive . 
This makes a solution more difficult to achieve . 
After all , if the financial industry &apos;s leaders are misleading investors , it is the culture of the entire industry that needs to be changed . 
Unfortunately , these giant settlements are unlikely to make a difference . 
They are paid by shareholders and taxpayers ( most of these settlements are tax-deductible ) , leaving the people who were ultimately responsible not only to walk away , but to walk away very rich . 
For example , Angelo Mozilo received almost $ 470 million during his tenure as CEO of Countrywide Financial . 
As far as I know , he paid nothing of BoA &apos;s $ 11.6 billion settlement cost . 
Mozilo did settle with the SEC , but on different charges ( insider trading ) . 
And he paid only $ 47.5 million of the $ 67.5 million settlement , owing to a $ 20 million indemnification agreement that was part of his employment contract . 
Why have Mozilo and others been allowed to pay a relative pittance and avoid criminal proceedings ? 
A few prominent criminal convictions have sent a powerful signal in the fight against insider trading . 
If the target is an industry-wide culture of deception , shouldn &apos;t the criminal justice system be mobilized against banks &quot; mortgage fraud as well ?
