Bridges to Somewhere 
BERKELEY - After another round of brinkmanship , a rancorous US Congress passed a last-minute bill to avert the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund ( HTF ) , the primary source of federal funding for America &apos;s highway and transit infrastructure . 
The HTF finances about $ 50 billion of infrastructure spending a year , and its bankruptcy would have forced state and local governments to shelve thousands of projects , threatening tens of thousands of construction jobs . 
The new legislation provides a temporary $ 11 billion fix that will postpone the HTF &apos;s bankruptcy for about ten months . 
Through fiscal gimmickry , the bill &apos;s funding costs are pushed beyond the arbitrary ten-year budget window behind which Congress hides to signal its fiscal responsibility . 
But there is nothing fiscally responsible about this legislation . 
Investment in public infrastructure in the US has plunged to less than 2 % of GDP , its lowest level since the federal government started tracking these data in 1992 . 
The American Society of Civil Engineers ( ASCE ) gives a grade of D + to infrastructure in the United States , reflecting both delayed maintenance and underinvestment . 
An estimated one out of every nine US bridges is structurally deficient , and 42 % of urban roads are congested , costing the economy an estimated $ 101 billion a year in wasted time and fuel consumption . 
Deficient and deteriorating transit systems impose another $ 90 billion in annual economic costs . 
The ASCE calculates that the US needs about $ 1.7 trillion of investment in surface-transportation infrastructure through 2020 to achieve a passing grade . 
It projects an investment shortfall of about 50 % based on current funding levels . 
Most economists agree that underinvesting in infrastructure is economically unwise and fiscally irresponsible . 
In a 2013 survey of economists by the University of Chicago , 75 % of the respondents agreed that , &quot; because the US has underspent on new projects , maintenance , or both , the federal government has an opportunity to increase average incomes by spending more on roads , bridges , railways , and airports . &quot; 
From a macroeconomic perspective , investing in infrastructure is a &quot; twofer &quot; : It strengthens productivity and competitiveness in the long run and boosts demand and creates jobs in the short run . 
According to the Congressional Budget Office , infrastructure spending is one of the most cost-effective forms of federal government spending in terms of the number of jobs created per dollar allocated . 
The HTF is funded by the federal gasoline tax , which is the federal government &apos;s single most important source of transportation funding . 
The tax has been stuck at 18.4 cents per gallon in nominal terms since 1993 . 
Meanwhile , the costs of building and maintaining highway and transit systems have increased significantly , and rising fuel efficiency has reduced gasoline tax revenues per mile driven . 
As a result , the purchasing power of the federal gas tax declined by about 30 % from 1997 to 2011 . 
Since 2008 , Congress has been filling the yawning HTF gap by providing $ 54 billion from general revenues . 
But makeshift solutions have become more contentious and harder to find , culminating in this year &apos;s gimmick-ridden ten-month patch . 
The CBO recently estimated that the HTF gap will widen to $ 172 billion over the next decade . 
An increase in the federal gasoline tax , with a built-in inflation adjustment , would be the easiest and most effective way to increase revenues for federally funded investment in transport infrastructure . 
Even Thomas Donohue , President of the anti-tax US Chamber of Commerce , calls an increase in the gas tax the simplest and most straightforward way to finance a long-term highway transportation bill . 
In a recent survey , more than half of the respondents expressed a willingness to pay more for gasoline to finance improvements in roads , bridges , and mass transit . 
The CBO estimates that an increase of ten cents a gallon would be required in 2015 simply to offset the last 16 years of inflation and fuel-efficiency gains and to maintain current ( inadequate ) funding levels . 
A considerably larger hike would be needed to prevent the underinvestment predicted by the ACSE . 
But , with a mid-term congressional election in November , there is strong opposition to such an increase , both in Congress and President Barack Obama &apos;s administration . 
That is entirely understandable . 
I was Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1994 , when President Bill Clinton successfully championed the last gas-tax increase , of just 4.3 cents per gallon . 
Some of his &quot; politically naive &quot; economic advisers , including me , advocated a much larger increase , phased in gradually over five years , on both fiscal and environmental grounds . 
Clinton &apos;s Republican opponents characterized the increase as the &quot; largest ever increase in taxes on the middle class . &quot; 
That misleading claim contributed to the Democrats &quot; deep mid-term election losses that year . 
In lieu of raising the gas tax , Obama has proposed a four-year $ 302 billion plan to close the existing HTF funding gap , and boost HTF spending by $ 20 billion a year above current levels . 
His plan , which relies on using transitional corporate tax revenues raised in conjunction with corporate tax reform , has virtually no chance of becoming law this year . 
Nor does his oft-repeated proposal for a federal infrastructure bank to attract more private funds for infrastructure projects . 
Confronted with implacable Republican opposition , Obama is relying on what the administration calls a &quot; pen and phone &quot; strategy - combining the bully pulpit and executive orders - to move forward on several fronts , including infrastructure . 
At the urging of his 2011-2012 Council on Jobs and Competitiveness , he signed several executive orders to modernize and expedite the interagency review-and-permitting processes for high-priority federal infrastructure projects . 
Moreover , Obama recently announced the creation of the Build America Transportation Investment Center to provide technical assistance to state and local officials seeking private-sector partners to support transport infrastructure . 
With similar offices , Canada and the United Kingdom have far surpassed the US in attracting private capital for such projects . 
A pen-and-phone strategy may be the only way to make any progress on addressing America &apos;s infrastructure needs in a mid-term election year . 
But Obama alone does not have the power to stanch the HTF &apos;s bleeding or to reverse years of underinvestment . 
That will require congressional action and additional revenues .
