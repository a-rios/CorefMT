Economists and Democracy 
CAMBRIDGE - I have been presenting my new book The Globalization Paradox to different groups of late . 
By now I am used to all types of comments from the audience . 
But at a recent book-launch event , the economist assigned to discuss the book surprised me with an unexpected criticism . 
&quot; Rodrik wants to make the world safe for politicians , &quot; he huffed . 
Lest the message be lost , he then illustrated his point by reminding the audience of &quot; the former Japanese minister of agriculture who argued that Japan could not import beef because human intestines are longer in Japan than in other countries . &quot; 
The comment drew a few chuckles . 
Who doesn &apos;t enjoy a joke at the expense of politicians ? 
But the remark had a more serious purpose and was evidently intended to expose a fundamental flaw in my argument . 
My discussant found it self-evident that allowing politicians greater room for maneuver was a cockamamie idea - and he assumed that the audience would concur . 
Remove constraints on what politicians can do , he implied , and all you will get are silly interventions that throttle markets and stall the engine of economic growth . 
This criticism reflects a serious misunderstanding of how markets really function . 
Raised on textbooks that obscure the role of institutions , economists often imagine that markets arise on their own , with no help from purposeful , collective action . 
Adam Smith may have been right that &quot; the propensity to truck , barter , and exchange &quot; is innate to humans , but a panoply of non-market institutions is needed to realize this propensity . 
Consider all that is required . 
Modern markets need an infrastructure of transport , logistics , and communication , much of it the result of public investments . 
They need systems of contract enforcement and property-rights protection . 
They need regulations to ensure that consumers make informed decisions , externalities are internalized , and market power is not abused . 
They need central banks and fiscal institutions to avert financial panics and moderate business cycles . 
They need social protections and safety nets to legitimize distributional outcomes . 
Well-functioning markets are always embedded within broader mechanisms of collective governance . 
That is why the world &apos;s wealthier economies , those with the most productive market systems , also have large public sectors . 
Once we recognize that markets require rules , we must next ask who writes those rules . 
Economists who denigrate the value of democracy sometimes talk as if the alternative to democratic governance is decision-making by high-minded Platonic philosopher-kings - ideally economists ! 
But this scenario is neither relevant nor desirable . 
For one thing , the lower the political system &apos;s transparency , representativeness , and accountability , the more likely it is that special interests will hijack the rules . 
Of course , democracies can be captured too . 
But they are still our best safeguard against arbitrary rule . 
Moreover , rule-making is rarely about efficiency alone ; it may entail trading off competing social objectives - stability versus innovation , for example - or making distributional choices . 
These are not tasks that we would want to entrust to economists , who might know the price of a lot of things , but not necessarily their value . 
True , the quality of democratic governance can sometimes be augmented by reducing the discretion of elected representatives . 
Well-functioning democracies often delegate rule-making power to quasi-independent bodies when the issues at hand are technical and do not raise distributional concerns ; when log-rolling would otherwise result in sub-optimal outcomes for all ; or when policies are subject to myopia , with heavy discounting of future costs . 
Independent central banks provide an important illustration of this . 
It may be up to elected politicians to determine the inflation target , but the means deployed to achieve that target are left to the technocrats at the central bank . 
Even then , central banks typically remain accountable to politicians and must provide an accounting when they miss the targets . 
Similarly , there can be useful instances of democratic delegation to international organizations . 
Global agreements to cap tariff rates or reduce toxic emissions are indeed valuable . 
But economists have a tendency to idolize such constraints without sufficiently scrutinizing the politics that produce them . 
It is one thing to advocate external restraints that enhance the quality of democratic deliberation - by preventing short-termism or demanding transparency , for example . 
It is another matter altogether to subvert democracy by privileging particular interests over others . 
For instance , we know that the global capital-adequacy requirements produced by the Basel Committee reflect overwhelmingly the influence of large banks . 
If the regulations were to be written by economists and finance experts , they would be far more stringent . 
Alternatively , if the rules were left to domestic political processes , there could be more countervailing pressure from opposing stakeholders ( even though financial interests are powerful at home , too ) . 
Similarly , despite the rhetoric , many World Trade Organization agreements are the result not of the pursuit of global economic well-being , but the lobbying power of multinationals seeking profit-making opportunities . 
International rules on patents and copyright reflect the ability of pharmaceutical companies and Hollywood - to take just two examples - to get their way . 
These rules are widely derided by economists for having imposed inappropriate constraints on developing economies &quot; ability to access cheap pharmaceuticals or technological opportunities . 
So the choice between democratic discretion at home and external restraint is not always a choice between good and bad policies . 
Even when the domestic political process works poorly , there is no guarantee that global institutions will work any better . 
Often , the choice is between yielding to domestic rent-seekers or to foreign ones . 
In the former case , at least the rents stay at home ! 
Ultimately , the question concerns whom we empower to make the rules that markets require . 
The unavoidable reality of our global economy is that the principal locus of legitimate democratic accountability still resides within the nation state . 
So I readily plead guilty to my economist critic &apos;s charge . 
I do want to make the world safe for democratic politicians . 
And , frankly , I wonder about those who do not .
