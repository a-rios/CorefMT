The French Cul de Sac 
PARIS - As France &apos;s presidential election looms , the country is approaching a breaking point . 
For three decades , under both the right and the left , the country has pursued the same incompatible , if not contradictory , goals . 
With the sovereign-debt crisis pushing French banks - and thus the French economy - to the wall , something will have to give , and soon . 
When the crunch comes - almost certainly in the year or two following the election - it will cause radical , wrenching change , perhaps even more far-reaching than Charles de Gaulle &apos;s coup d &quot; état , which led to the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958 . 
Most French politicians and bureaucrats call such notions scaremongering . 
After all , aren &apos;t key indicators like debt ratios or budget-deficit trends worse in the United States and Britain ? 
Indeed , France &apos;s predicament might seem comparable with the &quot; Anglo Saxons , &quot; were it not for the French political class &apos;s beloved baby , the euro . 
While the euro has not caused France &apos;s economic problems , its politicians &quot; commitment to the single currency represents an insurmountable barrier to solving them . 
The basic problem is that the country &apos;s super-generous welfare state ( public spending amounts to about 57 % of GDP in 2010 , compared to 51 % in the United Kingdom and 48 % in Germany ) stifles the growth needed for the euro to remain viable . 
The most serious structural flaws concern high payroll taxes and labor-market regulation , which make it difficult - or at least prohibitively expensive - for firms to reduce their workforce when business conditions worsen . 
The OECD reports that in 2010 , France &apos;s &quot; tax wedge &quot; ( income taxes plus employee and employer social-security contributions minus cash transfers as a percentage of total labor costs ) was at least 13 percentage points above the OECD average at every level of household income . 
The result has been elevated unit labor costs relative to France &apos;s peer group ( especially Germany ) and stubbornly high unemployment . 
During Valery Giscard d &apos;Estaing &apos;s presidency in the 1970 &quot; s , unemployment rose every year , reaching 6.3 % by 1980 . 
François Mitterrand promised rapid growth and lower unemployment when he came to power in 1981 , but presided over an economic slowdown and rising unemployment . 
By 1997 , unemployment reached 11.4 % , and dipped below 8 % in only one year since then ( 2008 ) . 
High unit labor costs and unemployment rates are responsible , in turn , for reducing the trend rate of economic growth , mainly owing to under-utilized labor , while the combination of lackluster growth and an ever-mounting welfare burden has resulted in chronic budget deficits . 
The last surplus was in 1974 . 
The current election campaign is accordingly centered on France &apos;s fiscal position . 
Everyone agrees that deficit reduction is required , while differing on how to go about it . 
Sarkozy &apos;s proposed cure is to boost growth by reducing the tax burden on employers , while simultaneously hiking the rate of value-added tax . 
His main opponent , Socialist leader François Hollande , would impose higher taxes mainly on the wealthy and the financial sector , but also on big business . 
With the only effective solutions - full-blown eurozone political union , or abandoning the euro - ruled out , muddling through is all that is left . 
Another name for this approach is &quot; transfer union , &quot; which implies relentless economic austerity and declining living standards , because strong countries - first and foremost , Germany - are determined to limit their liability for bailing out deficit countries by making all transfers conditional on tough budget retrenchment . 
At the same time , financial markets are forcing fiscal retrenchment on governments , as will the planned new fiscal treaty ( on which Germany , among others , insisted ) . 
Demand is therefore being drained out of the eurozone economies , with stronger external demand , stemming from the euro &apos;s depreciation against other major currencies , unable to offset the effect on growth . 
The French government expects budget revenues to match all spending except debt service by 2014 . 
But that forecast assumes continued growth , whereas France is slipping into recession . 
So the budget deficit will persist , and more retrenchment will be required . 
In the latter scenario , the change would be delivered either by a part of the mainstream political class that breaks ranks , or through a successful challenge by a political outsider , whether National Front leader Marine Le Pen on the right or Jean-Luc Mélenchon &apos;s Left Front . 
Both parties are campaigning on an anti-euro , protectionist platform . 
Sarkozy has adopted a statesmanlike pose , as befits the incumbent , warning voters of the hard grind to come , such as the need to work longer hours for lower hourly pay . 
Hollande &apos;s program , meanwhile , implies that pain can be avoided altogether by loosening European constraints . 
He has indicated that , if elected , he would re-negotiate the fiscal treaty and seek to alter the statutes of the European Central Bank - perhaps as an early sign of willingness to break with European orthodoxy . 
He is also promising to emulate his predecessors by bringing Germany around to the French point of view - that is , use German fiscal transfers . 
This is the sort of trick that Hollande &apos;s mentor , Mitterrand , was able to pull off . 
But that was possible not because of Mitterrand &apos;s superior wiles , but rather because France had a stronger position vis à vis Germany than it does today . 
France &apos;s response to the tension between preserving the European project ( equated with the single currency ) and avoiding a chronically depressed economy will be to put off the day of reckoning for as long as possible . 
This dead-end strategy will feature vain attempts to game Germany and desperate economic expedients , such as the essentially coercive capture of domestic savings to finance government debt .
