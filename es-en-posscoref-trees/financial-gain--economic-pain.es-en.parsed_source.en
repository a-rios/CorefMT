Financial Gain , Economic Pain 
NEW YORK - In the past three months , global asset prices have rebounded sharply : stock prices have increased by more than 30 % in advanced economies , and by much more in most emerging markets . 
Prices of commodities - oil , energy , and minerals - have soared ; corporate credit spreads ( the difference between the yield of corporate and government bonds ) have narrowed dramatically , as government-bond yields have increased sharply ; volatility ( the &quot; fear gauge &quot; ) has fallen ; and the dollar has weakened , as demand for safe dollar assets has abated . 
But is the recovery of asset prices driven by economic fundamentals ? 
Is the recovery in stock prices another bear-market rally or the beginning of a bullish trend ? 
While economic data suggests that improvement in fundamentals has occurred - the risk of a near depression has been reduced ; the prospects of the global recession bottoming out by year end are increasing ; and risk sentiment is improving - it is equally clear that other , less sustainable factors are also playing a role . 
Moreover , the sharp rise in some asset prices threatens the recovery of a global economy that has not yet hit bottom . 
Indeed , many risks of a downward market correction remain . 
First , confidence and risk aversion are fickle , and bouts of renewed volatility may occur if macroeconomic and financial data were to surprise on the downside - as they may if a near-term and robust global recovery ( which many people expect ) does not materialize . 
Second , extremely loose monetary policies ( zero interest rates , quantitative easing , new credit facilities , emissions of government bonds , and purchases of illiquid and risky private assets ) , together with the huge sums spent to stabilize the financial system , may be causing a new liquidity-driven asset bubble in financial and commodity markets . 
For example , Chinese state-owned enterprises that gained access to huge amounts of easy money and credit are buying equities and stockpiling commodities well beyond their productive needs . 
The risk of a correction in the face of disappointing macroeconomic fundamentals is clear . 
Indeed , recent data from the United States and other advanced economies suggest that the recession may last through the end of the year . 
Worse , the recovery is likely to be anemic and sub-par - well below potential for a couple of years , if not longer - as the burden of debts and leverage of the private sector combine with rising public sector debts to limit the ability of households , financial firms , and corporations to lend , borrow , spend , consume , and invest . 
This more challenging scenario of anemic recovery undermines hopes for a V-shaped recovery , as low growth and deflationary pressures constrain earnings and profit margins , and as unemployment rates above 10 % in most advanced economies cause financial shocks to re-emerge , owing to mounting losses for banks &quot; and financial institutions &quot; portfolios of loans and toxic assets . 
At the same time , financial crises in a number of emerging markets could prove contagious , placing additional stress on global financial markets . 
The increase in some asset prices may , moreover , lead to a W-shaped double-dip recession . 
The role that high oil prices played in the summer of 2008 in tipping the global economy into recession should not be underestimated . 
Oil above $ 140 a barrel was the last straw - coming on top of the housing busts and financial shocks - for the global economy , as it represented a massive supply shock for the US , Europe , Japan , China and other net importers of oil . 
Meanwhile , rising fiscal deficits in most economies are now pushing up the yields of long-term government bonds . 
Some of the rise in long rates is a necessary correction , as investors are now pricing a global recovery . 
But some of this increase is driven by more worrisome factors : the effects of large budget deficits and debt on sovereign risk , and thus on real interest rates ; and concerns that the incentive to monetize these large deficits will lead to high inflation after the global economy recovers in 2010-11 and deflationary forces abate . 
The crowding out of private demand , owing to higher government-bond yields - and the ensuing increase in mortgage rates and other private yields - could , in turn , endanger the recovery . 
As a result , one cannot rule out that by late 2010 or 2011 , a perfect storm of oil above $ 100 a barrel , rising government-bond yields , and tax increases ( as governments seek to avoid debt-refinancing risks ) may lead to a renewed growth slowdown , if not an outright double-dip recession . 
The recent recovery of asset prices from their March lows is in part justified by fundamentals , as the risks of global financial meltdown and depression have fallen and confidence has improved . 
But much of the rise is not justified , as it is driven by excessively optimistic expectations of a rapid recovery of growth towards its potential level , and by a liquidity bubble that is raising oil prices and equities too fast too soon . 
A negative oil shock , together with rising government-bond yields - could clip the recovery &apos;s wings and lead to a significant further downturn in asset prices and in the real economy .
