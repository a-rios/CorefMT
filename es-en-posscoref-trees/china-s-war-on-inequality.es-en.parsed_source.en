China &apos;s War on Inequality 
BEIJING - A major new target in the &quot; Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development &quot; that China just unveiled is to boost the growth rate for household ( disposable ) income so that it equals the growth rate of the country &apos;s GDP . 
The reason is simple : over the past 10 years or so , China &apos;s household income grew more slowly than GDP , making it a smaller and smaller proportion of total national income . 
Many important structural problems have resulted from this trend . 
Lagging household income has held back private consumption , even though the economy has the capacity to produce more consumer goods . 
It has also driven up corporate savings , because firms &quot; earnings are growing faster than household income and ( and , for that matter , faster than overall GDP ) . 
That , in turn , may cause higher investment or asset bubbles , as businesses seek to reinvest their savings somewhere . 
And lagging household income clearly contributes to China &apos;s trade surplus , because low domestic consumption tends to keep exports higher than imports . 
But there are even more problems related to China &apos;s disproportionately small household income , particularly growing income disparity . 
Indeed , not all of China &apos;s &quot; households &quot; have benefited alike from rapid GDP growth . 
Some social groups , such as skilled workers , engineers , and financial-sector employees , have seen their wages rise strongly . 
Urbanites - people with formal registration as urban residents - have recorded income gains as well , owing to their coverage by the government-run education system and social safety net . 
And , as corporate profits have grown , those who share the capital gains in one way or another have also seen their incomes increase faster than the national average . 
Those with less education , however , such as migrant workers and farmers , have fared much worse . 
The former earn an annual salary ( including fringe benefits ! ) totaling $ 2,000 ; the later may earn only half that . 
They comprise , in roughly equal parts , the low-income workers who account for up to 65-70 % of the total workforce . 
Their average income has grown , but more slowly than the 8-10 % annual GDP growth rate of the past 20 years . 
The target set by the new five-year plan is thus also a policy manifesto to battle these social disparities , which are now a burning issue for the country . 
But why did these disparities arise in the first place ? 
Thirty years ago , 80 % of China &apos;s labor force was composed of farmers . But , while that figure is down now to about 30 % , rural education has continued to suffer from inadequate funding and human capital relative to urban , industrializing regions . 
That caused rising inequality between the urban privileged and the rural poor . 
Geographical differences and government social policies that have been more favorable to urban and industrial sectors may be also be to blame . 
But the most fundamental problem is that development does not take place overnight . 
It takes a long time to bring education and better-paid jobs to everyone . 
During this long period , some get rich first , which means that others lag behind . 
Thirty years of rapid growth brought only half of China &apos;s famers ( about 200 million people ) into the industrial or service sectors , where their wages doubled . 
But at least another 150 million famers are still coming into the labor market , competing for higher-paying jobs . 
The old generation of farmers may stay put , but younger generations will continue to leave the land , creating a seemingly infinite supply of labor , which suppresses wages in all industries and services for lower-educated workers . 
As a result , the income of almost 70 % of the labor force cannot increase as fast as their labor productivity , and average household income thus cannot grow as fast as the economy as a whole . 
Given China &apos;s massive stock of &quot; surplus labor , &quot; this trend will not reverse itself soon . 
Indeed , the situation may worsen for another decade or two before it improves . 
This is why the government wants to intervene . 
In recent years , the central government has increased its spending on rural compulsory education and poverty relief , and local governments have changed regulations to increase the minimum wage by 20-30 % in all 30 provinces . 
In the next five years , more efforts in that direction are planned . 
The social-security system is to be extended to cover all workers and farmers . 
Fiscal and taxation reform is to be accelerated in order to transfer more income from the corporate sector to households and public budgets for social programs , including low-rent housing for the urban poor and more and better services for new immigrants from rural areas . 
But none of this will solve the problem . 
The best a government plan can do is to prevent the worst . 
Government subsidies may ( temporarily ) redress income disparity in a developed country where farmers account only for 2 % of the labor force , or in a country in which low-income groups count for only 10 % of the total population . 
But in China , where farmers make up 30-35 % of the labor force and 70 % of the population falls into low-income categories , government can play only a marginal role . 
In such circumstances , the old adage that the best social-welfare program is economic growth is all the more applicable . 
All the lessons from developing countries from the 1950 &quot; s through the 1980 &quot; s , and recent lessons from some advanced developed countries , tell us that over-burdening social programs with too great a focus on redistribution may cause large fiscal deficits , debt crises , hyper-inflation , or financial meltdown , with the end result being not a narrowing of disparity but an enlargement . 
China must keep these lessons in mind over the next 20-40 years . 
Indeed , continued growth and job creation is the only real solution for lifting hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty permanently .
