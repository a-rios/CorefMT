Look East To Save Europe \ u0027s Social Market 
As expansion of the EU approaches , many Europeans see in it only things to be feared : masses of economic migrants , and poor countries demanding subsidies . 
But Europe &apos;s new eastern members can also act as a beacon for the Union , as Jacques Rupnik suggests . 
It is often argued that Continental Europe &apos;s social and economic model , which seeks to combine competitiveness with solidarity , is the glue that binds the European Union together , as well as distinguishing Europe from the American ( or Anglo-Saxon ) free-market model . 
Clearly , Europe &apos;s answer to globalization is that certain spheres of social life-say , healthcare , education , the environment , or culture-cannot be left to the whip of the market . 
On the surface it seems that Europe &apos;s steady integration proceeded in parallel with the development of the welfare state . 
But this is misleading : the European social model is , in fact , part and parcel of the identity of the EU member states more than of the EU per se . 
Some , indeed , suggest that the EU often acts to erode the welfare state . 
This fear contributed to the reluctance of countries like Denmark and Sweden to embrace greater European integration . 
In both countries , majorities voted against adopting the euro because they feared that national welfare norms would become curtailed . 
So , across Europe , a key question is this : what is the future of the European &quot; social market &quot; model ? 
Can it survive once the Union expands from 15 members to 25 ? 
Many EU members look at the newcomers from Central and Eastern Europe and see countries that largely try to adhere to the liberal , free-market model . 
Having spent a decade dismantling the debris of state socialism , most of these countries chafe at the idea of importing the European social market &apos;s idea of solidarity via the EU . 
Their position goes beyond political philosophy . 
A bit of opportunism is also at work , for they undoubtedly also oppose EU regulation of taxation and social norms , adoption of which would deny them their comparative advantage for Western investors . 
With zero growth and 10 % unemployment , Western Europe &apos;s &quot; Rhineland model &quot; is no longer what countries seeking to undertake root-and-branch social and economic reform want to emulate . 
If Europe &apos;s social market model is to survive enlargement , it must find a way to expand eastward with the EU . 
But this can be accomplished only if the model is reformed in the West . 
Two factors could help the EU move in the right direction . 
First , the newcomers share a problem that undermined the social market model in Western Europe : demographic decline and , consequently , the prospect of soaring health and pension costs . 
The populations of the Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , and Estonia are aging and declining just as quickly as the populations of Spain or Italy . 
So the need to reform health and pension systems is similar in all of these countries . 
Second , public attitudes toward the social market system are remarkably similar in both Eastern and Western Europe . 
According to the Pew Global Attitude survey , there is a significant degree of convergence between East-Central Europeans and West Europeans concerning the balance between the market and a state-guaranteed social safety net . 
If the newcomers are to embrace the social market model , that model must operate throughout the EU and offer to them what it offered new EU members in the past . 
Sadly , this is not yet the case . 
Instead , EU enlargement is being carried out according to what might be described as the principle of &quot; asymmetrical integration . &quot; 
The asymmetry facilitated an eastward transfer of EU norms and institutional convergence , but no commensurate transfer of resources . 
EU regulatory power has taken precedence over its redistributive powers . 
But the Union &apos;s regulatory authority is likely to be accepted by the accession countries only if it remains tied to the redistributionist ethic at the heart of the EU &apos;s social model . 
Regulation without redistribution could undermine the EU &apos;s legitimacy among the newcomers . 
A report for the Chair of the EU Commission by a team of experts led by Jacques Sapir argued explicitly for a reorientation of the Union &apos;s &quot; cohesion &quot; policies eastwards , i.e. , in favor of those who most need them . 
Clearly , if the social market model is to expand eastward - thereby ensuring its viability within the whole Union - this is the only viable alternative . 
But this idea threatens current beneficiaries of EU redistributive policies , namely Spain ( which now gets over a third of Union cohesion funds ) and Greece ( which gets about a fifth ) , as well as Ireland . 
Countries that benefited most from European solidarity over the past twenty years are thus the least eager to share with their poor Eastern relations . 
The old European social model is in tatters . 
Its reform - or , rather , its re-invention - implies redefining what solidarity means , within both the member states and the EU as a whole . 
But for reform to succeed , a little old-fashioned solidarity extended Eastwards now is the best way to ensure the commitment of the EU &apos;s newest members to European integration .
