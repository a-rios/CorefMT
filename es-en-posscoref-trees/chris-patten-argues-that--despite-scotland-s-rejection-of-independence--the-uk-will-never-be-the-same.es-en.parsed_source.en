Reuniting the United Kingdom 
LONDON - In the end , democracy came to the rescue . 
The people of Scotland voted by a comfortable margin of about 10 % to remain part of the United Kingdom - not least because of the campaigning of three Labour politicians , Alastair Darling , Gordon Brown , and Jim Murphy . 
At times , it seemed that the result would be much closer , or even that we British might engineer the dismemberment of our country , which for centuries has brought together four national communities : England , Wales , Northern Ireland , and Scotland . 
The Scots have been part of the British state for more than 300 years , at the heart of the Protestant , imperial , adventuring , outward-looking culture that forged Britain &apos;s identity . 
Still , that identity has been fractured ; 
In any case , things will never be quite the same again . 
Now , the people of England , Wales , and Northern Ireland - not rejected , after all - must behave as well as possible to salvage something workable from the sometimes bitter and divisive arguments . 
We have to display magnanimity - a difficult enough virtue to practice at the best of times . 
Before trying to rise to this challenge , what can we learn from this walk along the cliff edge ? 
Despite the huge turnout on polling day in Scotland , referendums are a lamentable way of trying to settle big political issues . 
Those who established and developed parliamentary democracy in Britain knew this very well . 
Referendums are the favorite device of populists and would-be dictators . 
One vote on one day subsumes complex matters with one ballot question , which in any event is frequently not the question that many people actually answer . 
Parliamentary democracies should have nothing to do with them . 
In the event , we did not dispose of 300 years of shared experience and common prosperity on one Thursday in September 2014 . 
But there are three reasons why we seemed at times to come so close to that outcome , none of which reflect well on the British political process or , in my view , justify the claim that our future will , and must , be different . 
First , while Scottish nationalism has many honorable roots and aspirations , the campaign and its incubation showed a nasty tinge of chauvinism and an occasionally brutish hostility toward pluralism , reflected , for example , in the intimidation of some journalists . 
Overall , the English took on the role of what philosophers and social scientists call the &quot; other , &quot; an alien threatening force , in the pro-independence campaign . 
The English were every day &apos;s villains . 
Now we have to try to forget all of that . 
Second , Britain , like other countries in Europe , is suffering from the rise of angry , populist , anti-enlightenment political forces , fueled by conspiracy theories . 
In England , the electoral success of the UK Independence Party is one such example . 
Demagogues stack prejudices atop half-truths , and any attempt to connect discussion with reality is shot through with contemptuous accusations of dishonesty and self-interest . 
Responsible political leaders will have to be more aggressive , bold , and vigorous in confronting such interlocutors . 
Finally , as far as policy is concerned , we Britons have deluded ourselves to think that our system of government - increasingly shown to be unrepresentative , inefficient , and over-centralized - could survive with a little tinkering here and there . 
This belief has suited the two main political parties . 
Labour has sought to avoid a constitutional debate , because any move in the direction of federal institutions requires addressing the party &apos;s over-representation in the UK parliament . 
It is unfair to give ever more power to a Scottish parliament while continuing to give Labour , which controls 41 Scottish constituencies in the House of Commons , disproportionate say over what happens in England . 
As for the Conservatives , the party has allowed its belief in the union of the country &apos;s constituent parts to foreclose any discussion of how that union can be modernized . 
If we are to prevent the UK from rattling to pieces , we have to change the way we govern ourselves . 
Conservatives held a majority of the seats in Scotland less than 60 years ago . 
Today , there is one Scottish Conservative MP out of 59 in the UK Parliament , a mark of how the Tories have allowed themselves to be frozen out of some parts of the country . 
In some respects , this is the biggest challenge of all to the UK &apos;s political culture . 
Conservatives are losing touch with parts of the country where once they were strong - not just Scotland , but also cities and the north of England - and there is a growing disconnect between the party and Britain &apos;s increasingly important minority ethnic groups . 
Some of the same problems affect Labour . 
Both big parties will have to address these issues as we start on the long and difficult task of reforming a UK that has lost some of the glue of affinity and solidarity that has held it together for so long . 
For some British citizens south of the Scottish border , it will be difficult to act with the goodwill now required to recover from the referendum episode . 
I do not know how much Alex Salmond , the now-resigned Scottish Nationalist Party leader who pressed for the referendum , is responsible for the surge in his own party &apos;s support ; but I suspect that he may , alas , have galvanized all too much nationalist sentiment in England . 
I heard one commentator claiming that the referendum campaign was &quot; beautiful . &quot; 
Perhaps in the end , we really could &quot; trust the people , &quot; and that is an invigorating thought . 
Let others , who oppose democracy in their own countries , take note . 
But the campaign did come perilously close at times to being a triumph for un-reason . 
The challenge now is to figure out how to banish half-truths and big lies from our politics and restore reason and moderation to our divided land .
