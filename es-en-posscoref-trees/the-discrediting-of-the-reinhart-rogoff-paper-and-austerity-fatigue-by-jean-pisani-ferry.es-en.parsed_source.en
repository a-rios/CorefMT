A Fateful Mistake 
PARIS - Controversy is essential to the advancement of science . 
So the debunking of methodological flaws and a coding error in a paper by the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff is just part of everyday life in academia . 
Yet coverage of the controversy by the news media and the blogosphere has been astonishingly intense - and simplistic . 
&quot; Growth in a Time of Debt , &quot; the short 2010 paper in which Reinhart and Rogoff claimed that public debt starts to have a significantly detrimental effect on economic growth once it reaches 90 % of GDP , was never a celebrated piece of economic research . 
As a rough empirical characterization of stylized facts , it was received somewhat skeptically by the academic community , and both authors were known for much more noted contributions . 
Google Scholar , the academic search engine , records more than 3,000 academic citations of Rogoff &apos;s most cited paper , compared to less than 500 for &quot; Growth in a Time of Debt . &quot; 
What would have normally remained a subject for post-seminar small talk has , however , become a topic for discussion by journalists , commentators , and policymakers . 
For all of them , what matters is that the sorry fate of the Reinhart / Rogoff paper undermines the case for fiscal austerity . 
A few months ago , Olivier Blanchard , the International Monetary Fund &apos;s chief economist , had already criticized his colleagues and policymakers in advanced countries for systematically underestimating the recessionary impact of fiscal consolidation programs . 
The debacle of the Reinhart / Rogoff paper is widely regarded as another , fatal illustration of austerity &apos;s shaky intellectual foundations . 
But this is only partly true . 
Until the Reinhart / Rogoff paper , the main argument for fiscal retrenchment rested on concerns about the sustainability of public debt . 
The question was whether a sovereign would ultimately be able to repay its debt , given specific economic and financial conditions , long-term trends such as the aging of the population , and uncertainty about the future course of policy . 
The problem was that economists were unable to say how much is too much . 
There was no given threshold below which debt was innocuous and above which it was dangerous . 
So the message to policymakers was confusing . 
Economists were like doctors telling patients that , while some wine may be beneficial , too much is certainly dangerous - without being able to tell them how many glasses per day they were allowed . 
They were right , but hopelessly imprecise . 
Confusion was especially acute in early 2010 , when &quot; Growth in a Time of Debt &quot; was published . 
The global economy was just emerging from the deepest recession in the post-World War II period . 
A global Keynesian stimulus had prevented the worst , and the most urgent policy question was whether to continue supporting the economy or start consolidating . 
Some argued in favor of delaying consolidation , because the economy was still in a deep recession ; too harsh an adjustment , according to this view , would have a major impact on a still-weak private economy . 
Some claimed the opposite , arguing that , given the scale of the task , there was no time to lose . 
The Reinhart / Rogoff paper appeared to provide the perfect argument in support of rapid consolidation , which is why it was cited intensively in policy discussions . 
Austerity , it was argued , was needed to stem the rise in the debt ratio and safeguard long-term growth . 
To be sure , retrenchment could entail some short-term costs ; but the longer-term benefits would be much bigger . 
Even though Reinhart and Rogoff themselves did not draw that conclusion explicitly in their paper , many drew it for them . 
It was so tempting for a minister or a senior technocrat to explain that consolidation had to start immediately , because the 90 % threshold was approaching , that most of them did not resist it . 
Heavy reliance on what turns out to be disputed evidence now leaves the fiscal hawks in a weak position , to say the least , vis-Ã -vis their opponents . 
This is especially true in Europe . 
Having promised that rapid consolidation would be good for growth , and having delivered recession , the European Union has disappointed its citizens . 
Adjustment fatigue is setting in , and governments risk losing support if they go much further in their consolidation efforts . 
The danger is that the discrediting of hasty austerity could undermine the case for fiscal responsibility in the long run . 
If so , financial markets could conclude that public-debt sustainability is in serious danger - a perception that could have highly adverse effects on financing conditions . 
In the end , growth would indeed suffer , ironically proving Reinhart and Rogoff right . 
This episode once again underscores the importance of intellectual rigor . 
Of course , that is not always an easy credo by which to abide . 
Researchers are tempted by persuasive results that can attract the interest of policymakers , who are tempted by a selective reading of the evidence that can provide them with ammunition in domestic and international debate . 
Submitting to either temptation , as the Reinhart / Rogoff episode has shown , is never advisable .
