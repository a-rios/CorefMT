Latin America &apos;s Monetary-Policy Test 
SANTIAGO - On matters of sex , the citizens of mostly Roman Catholic Latin America often proclaim one thing and practice something very different . 
On matters of monetary policy , Latin central banks often also fail to live up to what they preach . 
In theory , monetary authorities in Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Mexico , Peru , and Uruguay adhere to the modern orthodoxy of inflation targeting , which holds that price stability is the main ( perhaps the only ) goal of monetary policy , the short-term interest rate should be the only instrument used to achieve the inflation target , and the exchange rate ought to float freely . 
But the actual practice of all six central banks bears only a passing resemblance to this orthodoxy . 
To begin with - and not surprisingly for export-led economies - the real exchange rate is also an ( implicit ) target for monetary policy . 
As a result , interventions in foreign-exchange markets have been lasting and widespread , even in countries like Chile and Mexico , which explicitly vowed to let their currencies float freely . 
Some countries - most notably Brazil - have also used taxes on international capital flows and other kinds of controls in an effort to guide the currency &apos;s value . 
The deviations from standard inflation targeting do not stop there . 
Colombia , Peru , Brazil , and other countries in the group have also used a range of unconventional policy tools - especially changes in reserve requirements for bank liabilities of varying maturities and currency denominations - to manage liquidity and credit . 
Unconventional monetary policy was most evident during the crisis . 
After all , if the supposedly orthodox chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Board , Ben Bernanke , was wisely throwing orthodoxy to the winds , why shouldn &apos;t Latin American central bankers do the same ? 
But such policies have since become part of their toolkit in more normal times . 
Brazil , for example , has recently lowered reserve and capital requirements in an effort to stimulate the economy after a slow 2011 . 
What is emerging is not an alternative paradigm , but rather an expanded , richer , and more flexible version of inflation targeting . 
And , if one is to judge by these six Latin American economies &quot; performance since the 2008-2009 shock , the record of &quot; inflation targeting-plus &quot; so far is encouraging . 
Historically , whenever the US economy sneezed , Latin America &apos;s economies caught pneumonia . 
This time around , the US became ( and remains ) very ill , yet Latin America barely sneezed . 
After mild and relatively short-lived recessions in 2009 , the region &apos;s economies recovered strongly in 2010 . 
Some of the credit should go to the new monetary-policy framework , which allowed central banks to create domestic liquidity quickly after international financing suddenly dried up . 
But a much-improved fiscal framework also helped - in countries like Chile and Brazil , fiscal policy could afford to become strongly counter-cyclical - and so did the rapid recovery in commodity prices in 2010 . 
In other dimensions , the record is mixed . 
It is not obvious that the various currency market interventions had a big effect on Latin American exchange rates . 
But as a result of these policies , every country in the group is starting 2012 with larger international reserves and foreign debts with longer maturities than they would have had otherwise . 
That is the right news at the right time , because 2012 will be a crucial time of trial for central banks throughout Latin America . 
The impending collapse in Europe , the global drop in risk appetite , and slower world trade are already having an impact on the region &apos;s economies . 
Exports are weakening , domestic credit is slowing , and asset prices are showing worrying volatility . 
In response , monetary authorities have signaled not just that they will cut rates , but also that they will use an array of unconventional measures to prop up growth . 
That is , central bankers are beginning to preach what they practice . 
Who knows , maybe private citizens will be next .
