The Politics of a Slowing China 
SINGAPORE - The recent financial turmoil in China , with interbank loan rates spiking to double digits within days , provides further confirmation that the world &apos;s second-largest economy is headed for a hard landing . 
Fueled by massive credit growth ( equivalent to 30 % of GDP from 2008 to 2012 ) , the Chinese economy has taken on a level of financial leverage that is the highest among emerging markets . 
This will not end well . 
Indeed , a recent study by Nomura Securities finds that China &apos;s financial-risk profile today uncannily resembles those of Thailand , Japan , Spain , and the United States on the eve of their financial crises . 
Each crisis-hit economy had increased its financial leverage - the ratio of domestic credit to GDP - by 30 percentage points over five years shortly before their credit bubbles popped . 
Economists who insist that China &apos;s financial leverage is not too high are a dwindling minority . 
Certainly the People &apos;s Bank of China , which engineered a credit squeeze in June in an attempt to discourage loan growth , seems to believe that financial leverage has risen to dangerous levels . 
The only questions to be answered now concern when and how deleveraging will occur . 
At the moment , China watchers are focusing on two scenarios . 
Under the first , a soft economic landing occurs after China &apos;s new leadership adopts ingenious policies to curb credit growth ( especially through the shadow banking system ) , forces over-leveraged borrowers into bankruptcy , and injects fiscal resources into the banking system to shore up its capital base . 
China &apos;s GDP growth , which relies heavily on credit , will take a hit . 
But the deleveraging process will be gradual and orderly . 
Under the second scenario , China &apos;s leaders fail to rein in credit growth , mainly because highly leveraged local governments , well-connected real-estate developers , and state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) successfully resist policies that would cut off their access to financing and force them into insolvency . 
Consequently , credit growth remains unchecked until an unforeseen event triggers China &apos;s &quot; Lehman &quot; moment . 
Should this happen , growth will collapse , many borrowers will default , and financial chaos could ensue . 
Two intriguing observations emerge from these two scenarios . 
First , drastic financial deleveraging is unavoidable . 
Second , Chinese growth will fall under either scenario . 
So , what impact will the coming era of financial deleveraging and decelerating growth have on Chinese politics ? 
Most would suggest that a period of financial retrenchment and slow GDP growth poses a serious threat to the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , which is based on economic performance . 
Rising unemployment could spur social unrest . 
The middle class might turn against the party . 
Because economic distress harms different social groups simultaneously , it could facilitate the emergence of a broad anti-CCP coalition . 
Moreover , massive economic dislocation could destroy the cohesion of the ruling elites and make them more vulnerable politically . 
Indeed , members of the ruling elite will be the most immediately affected by financial deleveraging . 
Those who borrowed recklessly during China &apos;s credit boom are not small private firms or average consumers ( household indebtedness in China is very low ) , but local governments , SOEs , and well-connected real estate developers ( many of them family members of government officials ) . 
Technically , successful financial deleveraging means restructuring their debts and forcing some of them into bankruptcy . 
By definition , such people have the political wherewithal to mount a fierce fight to preserve their wealth . 
But , given the huge size of China &apos;s credit bubble and the enormous amounts of money needed to recapitalize the banking system , only some of them will be bailed out . 
Those who are not will naturally harbor resentment toward those who are . 
Slower GDP growth undermines elite unity according to a different political dynamic . 
The current Chinese system is a gigantic rent-distributing mechanism . 
The ruling elites have learned to live with each other not through shared beliefs , values , or rules , but by carving up the spoils of economic development . 
In a high-growth environment , each group or individual could count on getting a lucrative contract or project . 
When growth falters , the food fight among party members will become vicious . 
The people who should be most concerned with financial deleveraging and slower growth are President and CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang . 
If the deleveraging process is quick and orderly , they will emerge stronger in time for their reappointment in 2017 ( the Chinese political calendar thus dictates that they turn the economy around by the first half of that year ) . 
Xi and Li are inseparably linked with the CCP &apos;s promise of economic prosperity and national greatness , embodied in the official catchphrase , &quot; China dream . &quot; 
What , then , will they do when faced with a political nightmare ?
