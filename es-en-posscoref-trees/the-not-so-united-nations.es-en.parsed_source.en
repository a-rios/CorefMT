The Not So United Nations 
The good news for Ban Ki-moon is that he has become Secretary General of the United Nations at a time when the prospects for conflict between or among the world &apos;s great powers - the United States , China , Japan , Russia , Europe , and India - are remote . 
The bad news is that the prospects for just about every other sort of conflict are high and the international agenda is both crowded and demanding . 
Ban needs to begin with a cold , hard assessment of his new position . 
A Secretary General of the UN is more secretary than general . 
He cannot command . 
It is not the same as being a president or a CEO . 
He possesses more influence than power . 
Moreover , power at the UN is divided , not simply between the Security Council and the General Assembly , but more fundamentally between the 192 members and the UN itself . 
The UN is comprised of sovereign states , but it is not sovereign itself and cannot act as if it were . 
More than anything else , the UN reflects the ability of the major powers ( above all , the US , China , Russia , France , and the United Kingdom , the five permanent , veto-wielding members of the Security Council ) to agree - and to back up their agreements with resources . 
When they are willing and able to do so , the UN can make a difference ; when they are not , the UN can act in only the most limited way , if at all , regardless of what the Secretary General wants . 
Consider Darfur . 
The world has largely stood by in the face of genocide . 
This is not a failure of the UN or the Secretary General so much as a reflection of the reality that the major powers are divided . 
China clings to a notion of sovereignty that allows governments freedom of action within their borders . 
In today &apos;s world , such an unconditional definition of sovereignty is inadequate . 
But the reality is that no amount of time spent negotiating in New York will turn things around . 
What matters are the instructions sent to China &apos;s UN ambassador from Beijing . 
In this case , Ban needs to spend time in China &apos;s capital , making the case for the notion that governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens , and that when they fail to do so ( as Sudan &apos;s government clearly is ) , they forfeit some of the advantages that normally are associated with sovereignty . 
Ban cannot simply reform the Security Council to reflect better the realities of this era . 
But he can make the case that countries such as Japan , India , Germany , and others deserve an enhanced position in the UN &apos;s most important body , one more commensurate with their power and status . 
Again , what is holding the UN back is not the UN itself , but its leading members , who cannot agree on what change is needed . 
Ban can also make the case that there is no justification in today &apos;s world for terror - defined here as the intentional harming of civilians for political purposes . 
Not just governments , but religious and other leaders need to be persuaded to denounce terror , shaming and de-legitimizing those who carry it out . 
The Secretary General is positioned to make this point loudly and repeatedly . 
Two other areas exist where practical changes are both achievable and desirable . 
Ban should support the creation of an international facility that would provide governments access to ( but not physical control of ) enriched uranium and plutonium for the generation of electrical power . 
Such an innovation would help stem the spread of nuclear materials and weapons , while also contributing to a shift away from use of oil and gas , thereby reducing global warming in the process . 
The other area is peacekeeping . 
Establishing a large , standing international force under the UN &apos;s control is not feasible and may not be optimal . 
But providing incentives for governments to maintain such forces at a high level of alert and setting standards for equipment , training , and professionalism is something the UN can and should do . 
All these suggestions highlight what might be any secretary general &apos;s most important asset : his voice . 
What Ban chooses to say , and how and where he says it , can enhance his influence . 
Over time , enhanced influence will enable him to get more things done . 
All this will be especially important now given the status of the US , the most powerful country in the world , but one with an often uneasy relationship with the UN . 
Opinion polls indicate a good deal of support among the American public for the UN . 
But there is also intense distrust of the UN among segments of the public and with certain elites . 
Here again , Ban would be well advised to leave New York and spend more time in the capital and around the country . 
The US needs and benefits from effective multilateralism in a global world , one in which challenges cannot be met by any single country acting by itself . 
The US has a particular need for effective international cooperation now , when it is stretched militarily , economically , and politically owing to its policies toward Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Contributing to the emergence of a more productive relationship between the world &apos;s most important international organization and its most powerful member would be no small feat .
