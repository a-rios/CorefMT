Can US-Iran Relations Be Revived ? 
During World War II , Allied soldiers occupied Iran , using the country as a way station to transport supplies from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union . 
This was Iran &apos;s first exposure to Americans . 
&quot; They arrived in our country with a certain innocence , &quot; said the respected Iranian historian Kaveh Bayat , &quot; and without any colonial pretenses . &quot; 
The Americans &quot; supply train would regularly pass through my father &apos;s ancestral village , Arak , then a scenic oasis of green gardens and fruit orchards . 
&quot; Whenever we heard the train coming , &quot; my father once told me , &quot; all the young boys in the village would run as fast as we could through the apple orchard to greet the passing Americans . 
They would smile and wave and throw us whatever gifts they happened to have - playing cards , chewing gum , lifesaver candies .... For us they were like heroes from another world . &quot; 
So much has changed since then . 
Iran &apos;s 1979 revolution did away with the pro-American , undemocratic regime of the Shah , bringing in its place the anti-American , undemocratic regime of the clerics . 
Relations between the United States and Iran have been officially non-existent since a group of radical students stormed the US embassy in Teheran - 25 years ago this week - taking sixty six Americans hostage for 444 days . 
Sixty years ago , Arak was a humble village known to US troops for its grapes ; today Pentagon officials hone in on it as an industrial city that is integral to Iran &apos;s worrisome nuclear program . 
And yet few countries have a more paradoxical relationship than the US and Iran . 
While the Iranian regime continues to be belligerently anti-American , the Iranian people are overtly pro-American . 
While the governments in Teheran and Washington appear to be strategic archrivals , in the words of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , &quot; there are few nations in the world with which the United States has less reason to quarrel or more compatible interests than Iran . &quot; 
Indeed , Iran has likely benefited more than any other country from US-led regime changes in Afghanistan and Iraq , as both the Taliban and Saddam Hussein were the country &apos;s sworn enemies . 
But neither side seized the opportunity to build on this common ground , and today US-Iran relations are as antagonistic as they have been in years . 
For the US , Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions , opposition to Israel , and support for extremist groups have become increasingly intolerable in the context of the war on terror . 
Iran &apos;s long-standing opposition to relations with the US is a bit more complex . 
To be sure , many of Iran &apos;s ruling elites came of age politically during the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist agitations of the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s , and still cling to that worldview . 
Although their revolutionary zeal may have waned over the years , they still tend to share the outlook of the late Ayatollah Khomeini , who likened the relationship between Iran and the US to that &quot; between a sheep and a wolf . &quot; 
Ideological rigidity alone , however , does not explain Iran &apos;s often-gratuitous anti-Americanism . 
For Iran &apos;s political and military elite , any increased liberalization that would likely result from an opening of ties with the US represents a threat to their interests . 
From their perspective , Iran is now a closed party - their party - and the less who join in , the merrier . 
With America bogged down in Iraq and oil prices hitting record highs , regime hardliners see little reason to compromise these days . 
On the other hand , some influential Iranians - led by former president Hashemi Rafsanjani - recognize that relations with the US are inevitable , given Iran &apos;s need to re-integrate into the international community and face its economic deficiencies . 
Moreover , the Iranian people are overwhelmingly in favor of rapprochement . 
As author Afshin Molavi wrote in his incisive travelogue Persian Pilgrimages , Iranian youth today are not revolutionary idealists , like those of three decades ago . 
Instead , they have concrete demands , like jobs and political and social freedom . 
They are desperate to enter the global community and rid themselves of a damaged international reputation . 
Today &apos;s Iranian intellectuals have undergone a similar maturation process , dismissing the &quot; utopianist &quot; and &quot; nativist &quot; political ideals of their predecessors . 
Referring to Jalal Al-e Ahmad &apos;s 1962 book Gharbzadegi ( &quot; West-toxication &quot; ) , which became one of the manifestos of the 1979 revolution , one secular intellectual in Teheran remarked to me that , &quot; Nobody reads Al-e Ahmad anymore . 
On the contrary , we long for interaction with the West . 
If it can bring us more economic opportunities , as well as social and political freedoms , let us be &quot; West-toxified . &quot; &quot; 
Still , despite popular demand in Iran , and common strategic interests , it could be years before America and Iran sit down and make amends . 
After 25 years of living without each other , reconciliation will not come immediately . 
When it does , there is good reason to believe that Iranians will greet their long lost friends with the same friendliness and exuberance that they did sixty years ago in Arak .
