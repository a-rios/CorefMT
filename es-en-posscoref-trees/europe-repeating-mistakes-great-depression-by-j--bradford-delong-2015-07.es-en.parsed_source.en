Depression &apos;s Advocates 
BERKELEY - Back in the early days of the ongoing economic crisis , I had a line in my talks that sometimes got applause , usually got a laugh , and always gave people a reason for optimism . 
Given the experience of Europe and the United States in the 1930s , I would say , policymakers would not make the same mistakes as their predecessors did during the Great Depression . 
This time , we would make new , different , and , one hoped , lesser mistakes . 
Unfortunately , that prediction turned out to be wrong . 
Not only have policymakers in the eurozone insisted on repeating the blunders of the 1930s ; they are poised to repeat them in a more brutal , more exaggerated , and more extended fashion . 
I did not see that coming . 
When the Greek debt crisis erupted in 2010 , it seemed to me that the lessons of history were so obvious that the path to a resolution would be straightforward . 
The logic was clear . 
Had Greece not been a member of the eurozone , its best option would have been to default , restructure its debt , and depreciate its currency . 
But , because the European Union did not want Greece to exit the eurozone ( which would have been a major setback for Europe as a political project ) , Greece would be offered enough aid , support , debt forgiveness , and assistance with payments to offset any advantages it might gain by exiting the monetary union . 
Instead , Greece &apos;s creditors chose to tighten the screws . 
As a result , Greece is likely much worse off today than it would have been had it abandoned the euro in 2010 . 
Iceland , which was hit by a financial crisis in 2008 , provides the counterfactual . 
Whereas Greece remains mired in depression , Iceland - which is not in the eurozone - has essentially recovered . 
To be sure , as the American economist Barry Eichengreen argued in 2007 , technical considerations make exiting the eurozone difficult , expensive , and dangerous . 
But that is just one side of the ledger . 
Using Iceland as our measuring stick , the cost to Greece of not exiting the eurozone is equivalent to 75 % of a year &apos;s GDP - and counting . 
It is hard for me to believe that if Greece had abandoned the euro in 2010 , the economic fallout would have amounted to even a quarter of that . 
Furthermore , it seems equally improbable that the immediate impact of exiting the eurozone today would be larger than the long-run costs of remaining , given the insistence of Greece &apos;s creditors on austerity . 
That insistence reflects the attachment of policymakers in the EU - especially in Germany - to a conceptual framework that has led them consistently to underestimate the gravity of the situation and recommend policies that make matters worse . 
In May 2010 , Greece &apos;s GDP had fallen by 4 % year on year . 
The EU and the European Central Bank predicted that the first bailout program would drive Greek GDP down by another 3 % below 2010 levels , before the economy began to recover in 2012 . 
By March 2012 , however , reality had set in . 
With GDP headed to 12 % below 2010 levels , a second program was put in place . 
By the end of the year , GDP had fallen to 17 % below 2010 levels . 
Greece &apos;s GDP is now 25 % below its 2009 level . 
And while some predict a recovery in 2016 , I fail to see how any analysis of demand flows can justify that forecast . 
The main reason the forecasts were so wrong is that those making them chronically underestimated the impact of government spending on the economy - especially when interest rates are near zero . 
And yet the clear failure of austerity to restart the economy in Greece or the rest of the eurozone has not caused policymakers to rethink their approach . 
Instead , they seem to be doubling down , on the theory that the deeper the crisis , the more successful the push for structural reforms will be . 
Such reforms are needed to boost long-term growth , the thinking goes , and if that growth does not rapidly emerge , it is because the need for them was even greater than originally thought . 
This , sadly , is the story of the 1930s as well . 
As the American commentator Matthew Yglesias points out , Europe &apos;s major center-left parties at that time recognized that what was being done was not working , but nonetheless failed to offer an alternative . 
&quot; It was left to other parties with less worthy overall agendas - Hitler , for example - to step in and say that if the rules of the game led to prolonged spells of mass unemployment , then the rules of the game had to be changed . &quot; 
Today , Yglesias adds , Europe &apos;s center-left politicians similarly &quot; don &apos;t have a strategy for changing the rules , and they don &apos;t have the guts to tear up the rulebook . &quot; 
As a result , austerity reigns , and dissent is left to populists like France &apos;s Marine Le Pen or Italy &apos;s Beppe Grillo - whose economic proposals seem even less likely to be effective . 
One would have thought we were capable of learning from the past , and that the Great Depression was important enough in European history that policymakers there would not be repeating its mistakes . 
And yet , at the moment , that is precisely what seems to be happening .
