American Power after Bin Laden 
OXFORD - When one state is preponderant in power resources , observers often refer to the situation as hegemonic . 
Today , many pundits argue that other countries &quot; rising power and the loss of American influence in a revolutionary Middle East point to the decline of &quot; American hegemony . &quot; 
For one thing , possession of power resources does not always imply that one can get the outcomes one prefers . 
Even the recent death of Osama bin Laden at the hands of United States special forces does not indicate anything about American power one way or the other . 
To see why , consider the situation after World War II . 
Many considered it a global hegemon . 
Nonetheless , the US was unable to prevent the &quot; loss &quot; of China , &quot; roll back &quot; communism in Eastern Europe , prevent stalemate in the Korean War , defeat Vietnam &apos;s National Liberation Front , or dislodge the Castro regime in Cuba . 
Even in the era of alleged American hegemony , studies show that only one-fifth of America &apos;s efforts to compel change in other countries through military threats were successful , while economic sanctions worked in only half of all cases . 
Yet many believe that America &apos;s current preponderance in power resources is hegemonic , and that it will decline , like that of Britain before it . 
Some Americans react emotionally to that prospect , though it would be ahistorical to believe that the US will have a preponderant share of power resources forever . 
But the term &quot; decline &quot; conflates two different dimensions of power : absolute decline , in the sense of decay or loss of ability to use one &apos;s resources effectively , and relative decline , in which the other states &quot; power resources become greater or are used more effectively . 
For example , in the seventeenth century , the Netherlands flourished domestically but declined in relative power as other states grew in strength . 
Conversely , the Western Roman Empire did not succumb to another state , but instead to internal decay and swarms of barbarians . 
Rome was an agrarian society with low economic productivity and a high level of internecine strife . 
While the US has problems , it hardly fits the description of absolute decline in ancient Rome , and the analogy to British decline , however popular , is similarly misleading . 
Britain had an empire on which the sun never set , ruled more than a quarter of humankind , and enjoyed naval supremacy . 
By World War I , Britain ranked only fourth among the great powers in terms of military personnel , fourth in GDP , and third in military spending . 
The costs of defense averaged 2.5-3.4 % of GDP , and the empire was ruled in large part with local troops . 
In 1914 , Britain &apos;s net export of capital gave it an important financial kitty to draw upon ( though some historians consider that it would have been better to have invested the money in domestic industry ) . 
Of the 8.6 million British forces in WWI , nearly one-third were provided by the overseas empire . 
With the rise of nationalism , however , it became increasingly difficult for London to declare war on behalf of the empire , the defense of which became a heavier burden . 
By contrast , America has had a continental-scale economy immune from nationalist disintegration since 1865 . 
For all the loose talk of American empire , the US is less tethered and has more degrees of freedom than Britain ever had . 
Indeed , America &apos;s geopolitical position differs profoundly from that of imperial Britain : while Britain faced rising neighbors in Germany and Russia , America benefits from two oceans and weaker neighbors . 
Despite these differences , Americans are prone to cycles of belief in decline . 
The Founding Fathers worried about comparisons to the decline of the Roman republic . 
Moreover , cultural pessimism is very American , extending back to the country &apos;s Puritan roots . 
As Charles Dickens observed a century and a half ago , &quot; if its individual citizens , to a man , are to be believed , &#91; America &#93; always is depressed , and always is stagnated , and always is in an alarming crisis , and never was otherwise . &quot; 
More recently , polls showed widespread belief in decline after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957 , then again during the Nixon-era economic shocks in the 1970 &quot; s , and after Ronald Reagan &apos;s budget deficits in the 1980 &quot; s . 
At the end of that decade , American &apos;s believed the country was in decline ; yet , within a decade , they believed that the US was the sole superpower . 
Now many have gone back to believing in decline . 
Cycles of declinism tell us more about American psychology than about underlying shifts in power resources . 
Some observers , such as the Harvard historian Niall Ferguson , believe that &quot; debating the stages of decline may be a waste of time - it is a precipitous and unexpected fall that should most concern policy makers and citizens . &quot; 
Ferguson believes that a doubling of public debt in the coming decade cannot erode US strength on its own , but that it could weaken a long-assumed faith in America &apos;s ability to weather any crisis . 
Ferguson is correct that the US will have to come to terms with its budget deficit to maintain international confidence , but , as I show in my book The Future of Power , doing so is within the range of possible outcomes . 
America enjoyed a budget surplus only a decade ago , before George W. Bush &apos;s tax cuts , two wars , and recession created fiscal instability . 
The US economy is still ranked near the top in competitiveness by the World Economic Forum , and the political system , in its own messy way , has slowly begun to wrestle with the necessary changes . 
Some believe a political compromise between Republicans and Democrats can be reached before the 2012 election ; others suggest an agreement is more likely after the election . 
Either way , fuzzy statements about hegemonic decline would again prove misleading .
