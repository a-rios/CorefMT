An Energy Tax for Europe 
George W. Bush &apos;s disastrous war in Iraq has put Europe in a bind . 
The United States long has been Europe &apos;s protector . 
Now , because of a war it wanted no part of , Europe finds its security undermined . 
Chaos in Iraq has empowered Iran - a much more dangerous country for Europe than Iraq ever was . 
And , with America bogged down in Iraq , Russian President Vladimir Putin has resurrected Soviet-style bullying tactics . 
Would Russia otherwise have dared to threaten to re-direct its nuclear missiles at European cities ? 
Not only has Bush destroyed Iran &apos;s most formidable enemy and bogged down US troops in a hopeless cause ; he also has enriched energy-abundant Iran and Russia by pursuing a war that has dramatically raised energy prices . 
High crude oil prices make it easier for Iran to build nuclear weapons and for Russia to use energy blackmail to threaten Europe . 
But Europe can fight back . 
By imposing a stiff tax on energy consumption , Europeans would reduce both consumption of energy and its price in world markets , in turn cutting the flow of funds to Russia and Iran . 
Because crude oil is priced in US dollars , and the dollar has depreciated against the euro , European consumers have gotten off relatively easy from rising energy prices . 
So an energy tax roughly equal to the euro &apos;s 33 % appreciation in recent years would be about right . 
Europeans might be forgiven for thinking that the Americans , who pumped up oil prices in the first place with their military misadventure in Iraq , should be the ones who &quot; pump it down &quot; with an energy tax . 
But , with a &quot; Texas oil man &quot; in the White House , it won &apos;t happen . 
Perhaps after 2008 , the politics in America will change in favor of an energy tax , but such a tax is needed now . 
Besides , given the strength of environmentalism in Europe , the issue is tailor-made for Europeans to take the lead . 
Moreover , Europeans do not narrowly equate national security with military spending . 
They know that confiscating the checkbooks of Russia and Iran would probably make the world a lot safer than building another submarine or aircraft carrier . 
Indeed , an energy tax would not only effectively counter the argument that Europeans are &quot; free riders &quot; when it comes to defense ; it would be tantamount to defense leadership . 
Still , with the amount of real resources transferred to their governments already high , Europeans might balk at a further increase . 
That is why the energy tax must be imposed as a tax substitution , with income or payroll taxes simultaneously reduced to keep real resource transfers to government at a constant level . 
This would increase economic growth as well as strengthen national security . 
Critics who worry about the cost of the energy tax have not thought about tax substitutions . 
They also do not seem to realize that an energy tax is a much cheaper way for Europe to protect itself from Iran and Russia than alternative means , such as a defense buildup . 
Europe currently lacks military muscle because it made a decision a half-century ago to be protected by the US and devote the saved resources to building up its welfare state . 
This strategy - which worked well for decades - always carried the risk that at some point America &apos;s resources might be tied up elsewhere , leaving Europe under-protected . 
That risk materialized with the Iraq war . 
But Europeans are showing little taste for increased defense spending , Iraq or no Iraq . 
Even France &apos;s new president , Nicolas Sarkozy - thought by many to be a pro-American foreign policy hawk - is backing away from his campaign promise to maintain defense spending at 2 % of GDP . 
In a recent speech to the French defense industry , Sarkozy conspicuously failed to repeat the pledge , instead warning that he soon might cut France &apos;s defense budget . 
According to a respected defense industry publication , Sarkozy changed his mind after his party &apos;s smaller-than-anticipated victory in June &apos;s parliamentary election . 
The reason Europeans are reluctant to increase defense spending is expense . 
Cutting welfare spending - where the big money is - would be painful . 
Solemn promises made over the years would have to be broken ( people would not get the social services that they paid for with a lifetime of high taxes ) , lives would be shortened ( less money for hospitals and nursing homes ) , and overall hardship increased . 
Even economic growth will not prevent a tradeoff between defense and welfare spending for Europeans . 
Fifty years of defense dependence on the US has created a powerful &quot; peace industry &quot; in Europe whose primary business is to fight defense spending tooth and nail . 
They will want to protect all social spending , regardless of the consequences for foreign policy . 
A counterweight to the &quot; peace crowd &quot; may be new migrants from Eastern Europe , for whom cuts in social services would break no promises , and for whom job availability and wage levels are more important . 
But it will take some time before the new migrants gain decisive political influence , and the problems of Iran and Russia for Europe require immediate attention . 
In short , Europeans will not allow Bush &apos;s Iraq war to become a war on their welfare state . 
What makes the energy imposed as a tax substitution tax particularly attractive as a defense measure is that it leaves the welfare state intact while making Europe safer , greener , and richer . 
Why wait ?
