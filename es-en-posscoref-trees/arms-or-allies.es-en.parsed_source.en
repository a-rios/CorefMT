Arms or Allies ? 
RIGA - It should surprise no one that many in Latvia view the sale by France of fully-equipped assault warships to Russia with grave concern . 
Other European Union member states seem to be looking increasingly towards Russia as a potential purchaser of military equipment . 
But is it wise for EU and NATO members to enhance the capacity of non-allies to project their military power ? 
After all , only two and a half years ago , Russia invaded Georgia , a country that NATO had named as a potential future member , and has occupied part of it ever since . 
The EU Council &apos;s common position on arms exports is legally binding on all EU states . 
Of course , competence and responsibility for arms-export controls and licensing rests with member states , not EU institutions . 
Indeed , under the Wassenaar Arrangement , a decision on exports is the sole responsibility of each participating state . 
Implementation of the common EU position on arms exports has led to more exchanges of information , greater transparency , and closer consultation . 
It has also harmonized export-control arrangements and procedures . 
But there are obvious limits to what can be achieved . 
Consultations are currently a bilateral matter , with no rules governing how they should be conducted - and no requirement that any final agreement on arms-export decisions be reached . 
The effectiveness of this consultation mechanism is difficult to evaluate . 
According to the common position &apos;s provisions , before a member state grants an export license , it should consult with any member state that has previously denied a similar license . 
But the common position does not specify the extent to which another member state should be consulted . 
More importantly , it does not require the arms-exporting member state to consult with any other member state that might have concerns . 
As a result , arms exports to third countries remain a contentious issue within the EU . 
At the heart of the matter is a conflict between the individual member states &quot; national interests - the competitiveness of European defense-related companies and the strategic importance of defense markets when linked to national foreign policy - and the Lisbon treaty , which refers specifically to enhanced solidarity and consultation . 
If the Lisbon treaty is to be respected , solidarity must be viewed as a political tool for moving towards a European defense policy that works for the common good . 
Pursuing solely national policies on technology transfer runs contrary to that goal . 
Clearer rules for the consultation mechanism need to be elaborated , and arms-exporting EU member states should consult all other member governments that might have concerns , not only those that have previously issued or denied an export license . 
The EU could work towards a common arms-export policy by seeking a shared understanding of the predictability and stability of third-party countries . 
Developing a common policy on arms exports to such countries should go hand in hand with the creation of a common and internationally competitive European defense-equipment market . 
This means that cooperation with non-EU countries should not be to the detriment of solidarity and common rules within the EU . 
Consulting at an early stage would help manage misperceptions - often fueled by reports in the media long before deals are concluded - and thus strengthen convergence and unity among EU member states . 
Giving the EU a greater role in situations where member states &quot; views differ should also be considered . 
For example , member states could consult on sensitive or contentious issues within the Political and Security Committee . 
This would strengthen the EU Council &apos;s common position , which already defines general rules for the control of exports of military technology and equipment . 
As for NATO , the question of consultations among allies is addressed in Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty , which states that , &quot; the Parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence , or security of any of the Parties is threatened . &quot; 
But Article 4 does not relate only to imminent threats . 
Decisions taken by a NATO country can have implications for other allies . 
The transfer of military equipment and technology to third countries could affect regional security and prompt a revision of threat assessments . 
The North Atlantic Council would seem an obvious forum within which to enhance solidarity among members , reassure member states that have perceptions of greater vulnerability , and avoid misperceptions . 
At a lower level , the Political and Partnership Committee and / or the Conference of National Armaments Directors could be used for initial consultations . 
These issues are of concern to all allies , so discussions should not be confined to bilateral agendas . 
Arms sales and technology transfers inevitably raise complex moral and ethical questions . 
That is all the more reason to seek open , confidence-reinforcing discussions among allies . 
Solidarity cannot be achieved when our most important institutions are excluded . 
Indeed , some of the most dangerous decisions taken in both the EU and NATO are those that are not openly discussed beforehand .
