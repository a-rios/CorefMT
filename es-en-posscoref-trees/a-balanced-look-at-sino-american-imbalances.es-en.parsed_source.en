A Balanced Look at Sino-American Imbalances 
BEIJING - Before July 2007 , most economists agreed that global imbalances were the most important threat to global growth . 
It was argued that the United States &quot; rising net foreign debt-to-GDP ratio - the result of chronic current-account deficits - would put a sharp brake on capital inflows , in turn weakening the dollar , driving up interest rates , and plunging the US economy into crisis . 
But this scenario failed to materialize . 
Instead , the crisis stemmed from the US sub-prime debacle , which quickly dragged the global economy into its deepest recession since the 1930 &quot; s . 
Most economists failed to foresee the economic dynamics that actually led to the crisis , because they failed to pay enough attention to the rapid increase in US total debt . 
Instead , they focused exclusively on US foreign debt , ignoring household debt ( mortgage and consumer debt ) , public debt , business debt , and financial debt . 
In particular , they should have paid greater attention to the sustainability of US mortgage and consumer debt . 
In 2007 , the mortgage and consumer debt-to-GDP ratio was more than 90 % , compared to 24 % for net foreign debt . 
Of course , the various components of debt differ considerably in their character and sources of financing - and thus in their sustainability . 
But all parts of a country &apos;s total debt and how it is financed are interconnected . 
This means two things . 
First , funds from different sources of finance are interchangeable to a certain degree : deficiency of funds for one component of total debt can be supplemented by surplus funds originally aimed at financing other components . 
Second , troubles in any single component of total debt will have an impact on all the other components . 
After the subprime crisis erupted , mortgage and consumer debt was paid down by households either with their savings or by default . 
The fall in US total debt , and the narrowing of the financing gap between total debt and domestic funds , led to a significant improvement in the US current-account deficit in 2008-2009 , disproving US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke &apos;s claim that the deficit was caused by a global &quot; saving glut . &quot; 
Indeed , America &apos;s current-account position strengthened despite the dollar &apos;s appreciation in the face of safe-haven demand . 
Unfortunately , as a result of the private-sector deleveraging and an increase in household savings , the US economy , driven by debt and consumption , slid into recession . 
To offset the negative impact of private-sector deleveraging on growth , the US government has maintained expansionary fiscal and monetary policies . 
Now , with household debt sustained on a knife-edge after feverish government intervention , the fiscal position has deteriorated dramatically and the current-account balance has worsened again . 
Sustainability of public debt has replaced sustainability of private debt as the biggest threat to financial stability , and the focus of debate about the US current account has shifted from the sustainability of foreign debt to the impact of reducing the external deficit on growth and employment . 
The dilemma facing US policymakers is how to stimulate growth while lowering the level of total debt . 
The most important way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening US competitiveness . 
But where will increased competitiveness come from ? 
Devaluation of the dollar could improve US competitiveness in the short run , but it is not a solution . 
Because rapid fiscal deterioration now has investors worrying about capital losses on US government securities , devaluation would make foreigners more hesitant to finance America &apos;s budget deficit . 
If foreign financing is not forthcoming , yields on US government debt will rise and the US economy will fall back into recession . 
In the long run , America &apos;s growth pattern must undergo a structural shift from reliance on debt and consumption one based on Americans vaunted capacity for creativity and innovation . 
Only then will America improve its competitiveness enough to allow the government to reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels while maintaining a respectable growth rate . 
But neither improved competitiveness , nor reduction of total debt , can be achieved overnight . 
In the short run , the US current-account deficit will remain , regardless of which country runs bilateral surpluses . 
Thus , China &apos;s continued reinvestment of its current-account surplus in US government securities is of utmost important for US growth and financial stability . 
Given that America benefits mightily from China &apos;s purchases of US government securities , it is difficult to understand why the US government and Congress have been complaining so much about the bilateral current-account deficit . 
It is also difficult to grasp why China is so reluctant to reduce its bilateral surplus , given meager returns on its massive holdings of US government securities and a sustained risk of large capital losses in the future . 
The good news is that , following President Hu Jintao &apos;s recent visit to Washington , both America and China have been taking positive steps to resolve their differences over the bilateral current-account balance . 
That augurs well for a more rational and constructive Sino-American dialogue on global imbalances , which would certainly benefit the global economy .
