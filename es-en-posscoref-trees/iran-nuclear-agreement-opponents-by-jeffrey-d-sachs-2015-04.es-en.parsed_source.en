The Case for Peace With Iran 
NEW YORK - The nuclear framework agreement between Iran and the five permanent UN Security Council members ( the United States , the United Kingdom , France , China , and Russia ) plus Germany is an important achievement in global diplomacy . 
The deal announced earlier this month represents the triumph of rational hope over irrational fear , and it deserves to be implemented . 
But now the race is on against hardliners in the US , Iran , Israel , and elsewhere , who want to kill the deal before the deadline for a final agreement in June . 
The framework agreement benefits all parties . 
Iran scales back its nuclear activities , especially the enrichment of uranium fuel , in exchange for an end to economic sanctions . 
Its government is kept further away from developing a nuclear bomb - which it denies pursuing - and gains room for economic recovery and normalization of relations with the major powers . 
It is a smart , pragmatic , and balanced approach , subject to monitoring and verification . 
It does not require that the US and Iranian governments suddenly trust each other ; but it does offer an opportunity to build confidence , even as it allows for specific steps that are in each side &apos;s interests . 
Crucially , it is part of international law , within the framework of the UN Security Council . 
By propounding the idea that the other side can never be trusted , the hardliners are advancing a self-fulfilling theory of politics and human nature that makes war far more likely . 
These purveyors of fear deserve to be kept on the sidelines . 
It is time to make peace . 
The great divide between the West and Iran today , it should be noted , is largely the result of malign Western behavior toward Iran ( Persia until 1935 ) in the past . 
From the start of the twentieth century , the British Empire manipulated Persia in order to control its vast oil reserves . 
After World War II , that job fell increasingly to the US . 
Indeed , from coup to dictatorship to war to sanctions , the US has racked up more than 60 continuous years of trying to impose its will on Iran . 
The CIA and Britain &apos;s MI6 jointly toppled Mohammad Mossadegh &apos;s democratically elected government in 1953 , in order to block Mossadegh &apos;s attempts to nationalize Iran &apos;s oil reserves . 
The US then installed the brutal dictatorship of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , which ruled the country until the Islamic Revolution of 1979 . 
Following the revolution , the US helped to arm Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s , in which an estimated one million Iranians died . 
Since 1987 , the US has imposed economic sanctions against Iran on a variety of premises , including claims of Iranian terrorism and the alleged nuclear threat . 
And the US has worked hard to internationalize these sanctions , leading the push for UN measures , which have been in place since 2006 . 
The US hardliners have their own long list of grievances , starting with the 1979 seizure of America &apos;s embassy in Tehran , in which 66 US diplomats and citizens were held for 444 days . 
Then there is Iran &apos;s involvement in Islamist insurgencies , and its support for anti-Israel political movements and groups deemed to be terrorist . 
Still , the British and American abuses vis-à-vis Persia and Iran started earlier , lasted longer , and imposed far higher costs than Iran &apos;s actions vis-à-vis the US and UK . 
Moreover , much of what the US categorizes as Iranian &quot; terror &quot; is a product of the region &apos;s sectarian struggles between Shia , backed by Iran , and Sunnis , backed by Saudi Arabia . 
&quot; Terror &quot; is a term that obscures rather than clarifies these long-standing clashes and rivalries . 
That is why Iran , called a &quot; terrorist state &quot; by US hardliners , is now America &apos;s de facto ally in the fight against Sunni jihadists in Iraq and Syria . 
Iran &apos;s confrontation with the UK and the US is part of the much broader saga of the West &apos;s use of its military and economic dominance to project its power and political will over much of the world during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . 
Today &apos;s low- and middle-income countries are only now entering a period of true sovereignty . 
The proposed agreement with Iran will not overcome a century of distrust and manipulation , but it can begin to create a new path toward peace and mutual respect . 
Mutual benefit will be achieved by honest appraisals of mutual interests , and step-by-step progress backed by verification , not by hardliners on both sides claiming that the other side is pure evil and insisting on complete triumph . 
The success of US President John F. Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in reaching the 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty , at the height of the Cold War , provides an instructive lesson . 
At the time , hardliners on both sides denounced the LTBT as a weakening of national defense in the face of an implacable enemy . 
In fact , both sides fully honored the treaty , and it led to the landmark 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
JFK &apos;s words a half-century ago apply to the Iran agreement today . 
The LTBT , said Kennedy in 1963 , &quot; is not a victory for one side - it is a victory for mankind . &quot; 
This treaty , he said , &quot; will not resolve all conflicts , or cause the Communists to forgo their ambitions , or eliminate the dangers of war . 
It will not reduce our need for arms or allies or programs of assistance to others . 
But it is an important first step - a step towards peace - a step towards reason - a step away from war . &quot;
