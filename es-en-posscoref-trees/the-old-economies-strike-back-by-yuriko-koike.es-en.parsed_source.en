The Old Economies Strike Back 
TOKYO - The impact of Abenomics on Japan &apos;s economy is gradually beginning to be felt . 
Annual GDP growth in the first quarter has been revised upward , to 4.1 % , exceeding market expectations and providing a strong indication that the Japanese economy is finally recovering , after two decades of stagnation . 
Consumer spending is particularly robust , as wages show signs of upward movement . 
Moreover , the currency depreciation in the wake of the Bank of Japan &apos;s efforts to increase the annual inflation rate to 2 % is expected to benefit exporters , though a substantial effect on the trade balance is yet to be seen , probably owing to higher import costs . 
In particular , thermal electricity plants have replaced the country &apos;s nuclear plants - offline since the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 - and the weak yen has hit the import bill for oil and gas hard . 
Japan &apos;s growth revival comes at a time of increasing economic uncertainty in much of the developing world . 
For example , Japan &apos;s trade statistics for May indicate that exports to the United States increased at a double-digit pace year on year , to around ¥ 5.1 trillion , while exports to China were sluggish , reaching ¥ 4.8 trillion . 
Indeed , the US has overtaken China as Japan &apos;s main export market , as America &apos;s economy , too , recovers from half-a-decade of sluggishness . 
In China , by contrast , exports in May rose by just 1 % year on year - the lowest rate since last July - while imports fell by 0.3 % . 
Exports to Japan were down by 5.7 % , while exports to the US and the European Union decreased by 1.6 % and by 9.7 % , respectively , with both falling for three months in a row . 
As a result , the trade surplus continued to fall , to $ 20.4 billion , fueling growing concern about a Chinese slowdown . 
China &apos;s downturn appears sudden ; after all , its exports had been rising at double-digit rates every month this year until May . 
In fact , the Chinese economy &apos;s true condition had long been obscured , but has now been exposed by more stringent regulation of activities such as speculative trading of the renminbi masquerading as trade payments . 
In particular , China &apos;s &quot; two systems in one country &quot; enabled exports to bonded warehouses in Hong Kong to be used to pad trade statistics . 
Moreover , Chinese exports sometimes would increase in the face of a slump in the volume of cargo being shipped from ports . 
The reason was simple : businesses benefit from tax exemptions or reductions for products that are exported . 
So , when companies from the mainland dealt with each other , they would export to Hong Kong first and then import back to the mainland , resulting in the transaction being treated as an export . 
For example , trade in Guangdong Province and Hong Kong in the first quarter of 2013 increased by 91.6 % year on year . 
In particular , there was a sudden increase in exports via the free-trade zone in Guangdong . 
After the regulatory authorities intervened in May , annual exports to Hong Kong rose by only 7.7 % , down sharply from the 57 % increase reported in April . 
Economic conditions in China appear set to worsen further . 
The enormous investments launched in China &apos;s interior as part of the government &apos;s stimulus program following the 2008 global financial crisis have now become a burden and are increasingly showing up as bad debt on the balance sheets of the country &apos;s banks . 
China is not alone in finding its economy stumbling . 
More broadly , as the US and Japan recover , cracks are starting to appear in emerging countries that , relative to the advanced countries , had enjoyed enviable rates of economic growth since 2008 . 
Growth in India has slowed significantly in the last two years , and large-scale street protests in Turkey and Brazil could herald hard times ahead in both of those countries . 
For most of the twenty-first century , emerging markets &quot; rising importance - and , with it , a reordering of the global economy and international relations - has been conventional wisdom . 
But , today , it is the two largest &quot; old &quot; economies - Japan and the US - that are showing signs of increasing vitality . 
Japan is seeking to revive its economy through Abenomics . 
The US economy &apos;s road to recovery is being built on the shale-gas revolution , a revived manufacturing sector , and a decline in the US budget deficit in GDP terms . 
The &quot; old &quot; economies appear to be returning to the spotlight . 
If current trends continue , they may well become the next new thing .
