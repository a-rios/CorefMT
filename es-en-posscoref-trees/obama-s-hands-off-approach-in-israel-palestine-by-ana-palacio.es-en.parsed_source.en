Obama &apos;s Promised Land 
MADRID - Now that the dust has settled on President Barack Obama &apos;s much-anticipated trip to Israel , it is possible to analyze the significance of the visit . 
The trip - the first foreign visit of his second term - carries important implications for US foreign policy . 
Rather than providing the breakthrough for which many had hoped , it demonstrated that Obama - unlike other second-term US presidents , who have staked their legacies on foreign policy - is interested primarily in securing a domestic legacy . 
Obama &apos;s ambitions are centered on reversing the arrangement that has dominated US politics since Richard Nixon &apos;s election in 1968 . 
He hopes to ensure that a moderate Democratic Party forms the core of domestic politics and policymaking , with the Republican Party consigned to the periphery . 
The centerpiece of Obama &apos;s visit was his address in Jerusalem , in which - employing his characteristically compelling rhetoric - he won over the skeptical Israeli public by appealing to their sense of morality , asking them to imagine the conflict from a Palestinian perspective . 
And yet , while the speech was widely considered a successful exercise in public diplomacy , it did not herald renewed US involvement in peace negotiations . 
Rather , it portends a continuation of America &apos;s hands-off approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict . 
Obama &apos;s decision to address the Israeli people instead of their leaders is telling . 
He recognizes that the current political climate is not conducive to successful peace negotiations . 
In Israel , Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has crafted a center-right coalition dominated by prominent pro-settlement leaders , including Housing Minister Uri Ariel of the Jewish Home Party and Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon of Netanyahu &apos;s Likud . 
The only notable exception , Justice Minister Tzipi Livni , seems to have been appointed merely to provide a veneer of official commitment to the peace process . 
Finance Minister Yair Lapid , a moderate , is removed from the peace process ( and has himself sent mixed signals about a two-state solution ) . 
Moreover , despite Netanyahu &apos;s 2009 declaration of support for a two-state solution , which he reaffirmed during Obama &apos;s visit , Likud has embraced a pro-settlement position , exemplified by Israel &apos;s planned construction in the E1 corridor , one of the West Bank &apos;s most sensitive areas . 
Meanwhile , the political situation in Palestine - characterized by the erosion of President Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s legitimacy - and the region &apos;s overall instability are contributing further to the decay of the peace process . 
Rather than expending significant political capital trying to press an unreceptive Israeli government and a fractured Palestinian establishment to pursue peace , Obama used his visit to shift the discourse - and the responsibility for achieving a peace agreement - to the Israeli ( and Palestinian ) public . 
Indeed , beneath Obama &apos;s rhetoric about empathy and the morality of peace was a clear message about the future of the peace process : the push for negotiations must come from the streets of Israel and Palestine . 
It will not come from Washington . 
This was a tactical move that allowed Obama to address the conflict without having to put any additional skin in the game , while advancing his visit &apos;s underlying objective of reducing Israel &apos;s ability to distract from his domestic goals . 
The price of Obama &apos;s approach is that it denies any potential for progress toward peace . 
Furthermore , Obama &apos;s embrace of Israel during his visit has undermined America &apos;s role as an honest broker in future negotiations - and no credible candidate has surfaced to fill the position . 
The trip also heralds a dramatic shift in Israel &apos;s relationship with Obama , who has been criticized throughout his presidency for supposedly failing to provide sufficient support to America &apos;s strongest ally in the Middle East . 
The recent Senate hearings to confirm Chuck Hagel &apos;s appointment as Secretary of Defense , which involved aggressive questioning about the former senator &apos;s commitment to Israel , reflected that criticism . 
Facing continuing battles with Congress , mid-term elections next year , and increasing instability in the Middle East ( including the threat of unilateral Israeli action against Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities ) , Obama clearly believes that now is not the time to push for a peace agreement , because it is unlikely to succeed . 
Instead , he is working to make Israel a non-issue by quieting domestic critics and allaying Israel &apos;s security fears . 
To this end , Obama has withdrawn his support for preconditions to peace negotiations , indicating to Palestinians that they should not expect a freeze on Israeli settlement construction ahead of talks . 
In his Jerusalem address , he reaffirmed America &apos;s commitment to preserving Israel &apos;s security while pledging to control Syria &apos;s chemical-weapons stockpile and to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons . 
This strategy has already produced results . 
Netanyahu &apos;s apology to Turkey for the commando raid on a Gaza-bound Turkish ship in 2010 was a major diplomatic victory for Obama . 
More important , the absence of a contentious Netanyahu-Obama relationship will deny Republicans an easy target in mid-term elections . 
( Such low-hanging fruit has been increasingly scarce for the Republican Party , which is beleaguered by the perception that it has been hijacked by its most extreme elements . ) 
In the unlikely event that circumstances change , Obama could step in as an active peacemaker , giving his trip to Israel historic significance as a turning point in Israel-Palestine relations . 
Livni might find a strong voice in Israel &apos;s government ; the Labor Party could replace Jewish Home in a new governing coalition ; or Netanyahu &apos;s attitude could change as he seeks to secure his legacy . 
Without a drastic change in Israeli politics and society , however , Obama will continue to play it safe , minimizing his vulnerabilities . 
As he moves closer to solidifying the Democratic Party &apos;s position in US politics , Israel will continue to construct settlements and become increasingly isolated . 
We can only hope that the consequences of Obama &apos;s foreign-policy sacrifice are not too high a price to pay for the establishment of his domestic legacy .
