The Slave Ethos and the African Economy 
DAKAR - The slump in prices for Africa &apos;s natural resources , which led to chronic deficits in the past , has been reversed . 
Consumption , fueled by huge Asian demand for African commodities , is on the rise across the continent . 
For much of Africa , this turn of events should mark a decisive break with endemic poverty . 
But , unless African leaders change their ways , it will not . 
Africa is estimated to hold more than 10 % of global oil reserves and one-third of reserves of cobalt and base metals . 
South Africa alone possesses 40 % of the world &apos;s gold , which has been skyrocketing in value since the onset of the global financial crisis . 
Africa &apos;s agricultural potential has barely been touched . 
Long-term global demand for Africa &apos;s commodities , land , and manpower is unlikely to diminish . 
China , which has increased trade with Africa five-fold since 2003 , has played a leading role in this turnaround , which has encouraged investors from elsewhere , including Europe and the United States , to rethink their approach to investing in Africa . 
This has translated into a steady flow of multibillion-dollar investments in the region . 
As a result , the IMF forecasts 4.7 % GDP growth in sub-Saharan Africa this year , rising to nearly 6 % in 2011 . 
Unfortunately , however , while the direction of Africa &apos;s trade may be changing , its composition - raw-material exports and manufactured imports - is not . 
In the half-century since colonialism ended ( for the most part ) , sub-Saharan Africa has experienced many false dawns . 
One remembers the 1960 &quot; s , when the global economy &apos;s &quot; long boom &quot; gave Africa a chance to save its surpluses , invest in value-added industries , and increase productivity . 
Instead , Africa squandered the opportunity on consumption of foreign goods . 
This pattern of behavior conforms to some of the worst undertakings of Africa &apos;s elite . 
Hundreds of years ago , many African kings effectively engaged with the West &apos;s rising imperial powers to halt the growth of indigenous industry in pre-colonial Africa . 
Instead of having their peoples begin to manufacture their own goods , these rulers chose to import them from Europe in exchange for their own subjects - or the subjects of neighboring rulers - whom they exported as slaves . 
Back then , imported goods consisted mainly of beads , alcohol , and , most importantly , weapons , which enabled these rulers to exercise extreme violence over their people . 
It was a system that no doubt worked to the benefit of Africa &apos;s partners . 
When slavery was abolished in the mid-nineteenth century , the terms of these rulers &quot; partnership with Western colonizers changed from trade in slaves to trade in commodities . 
After independence in the early 1960 &quot; s , during the Cold War , many African rulers played the West against the Soviet bloc to retain their predatory economies . 
Today , they pursue the same goal with the help mainly of China , but also of Iran , Venezuela , and occasionally India and Brazil . 
Elite networks continue to conspire with foreign interests to cannibalize their economies and retain the perquisites of power : fleets of luxury cars , private jets , bank accounts in tax havens , overseas properties , consumer goods , weaponry , etc . 
This culture of exploiting Africa &apos;s human and natural resources at will - not through entrepreneurial endeavor and wealth creation , but by means of predatory politics - is deeply entrenched . 
Indeed , the few trade unionists , intellectuals , and others who challenge these regimes usually do not seek to change how the state functions , but rather to ensure that , as they put it , they get their &quot; turn to eat . &quot; 
One might expect that national and international non-governmental organizations would fill the gap . 
Not so . 
If a few NGOs have achieved great results fighting the ills of Africa &apos;s poor , the vast majority are perceived as either a &quot; fifth column &quot; of the West or a refuge for fringe members of the elite who use widespread poverty as another source of lucre . 
According to estimates published in the Financial Times on June 1st , at least $ 854 billion ( € 702.6 billion ) have been siphoned from Africa since 1970 in cumulative capital flight . 
However , this cost is nothing compared to the scars associated with Africans being seen around the world as the &quot; wretched of the earth . &quot; 
Apart from war-ravaged regions , only Africa has so many young people - some 60 % of the population - who are prepared to brave any danger to flee their land . 
However sad and painful it is to admit , a fleet of slave ships docking on Africa &apos;s shores today would be overrun by willing would-be deportees . 
At the turn of the millennium , a meeting of African church leaders convened on the Senegalese island of Gorée to urge Africans to assess their share of responsibility for the slave trade . 
The call went unheeded , in keeping with the general atmosphere of self-denial surrounding the issue . 
Historians and others who venture to break the silence are lambasted as traitors to the black cause . 
Yet the truth cannot be denied . 
Africa faces a crisis of leadership and governance , owing to a dysfunctional ethos . 
If Africans want to change this , they cannot spare themselves a collective debate about their elites &quot; complicity in widespread impoverishment .
