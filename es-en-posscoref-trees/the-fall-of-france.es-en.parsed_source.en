The Fall of France 
French influence in Europe is declining , and President Jacques Chirac is largely to blame . 
He made the right choice before the Iraq war - America &apos;s intervention was never justified and has yielded a terrible failure - and so found himself in sync with an emerging European , even global , opposition to the Bush administration . 
Chirac &apos;s stature and experience should have allowed him to rally all of Europe before , during or after the crisis . 
Faced with American unilateralism , he failed to promote realistic multilateral solutions . 
On the contrary , despite being right about Iraq , Chirac became isolated , an isolation that grew because he also failed to re-establish satisfactory relations with President Bush . 
Indeed , under Chirac , France appears increasingly arrogant , a nation convinced of the righteousness of its views and the universality of its model - the very charges so often levelled against George W. Bush &apos;s America . 
Chirac compounded his errors over Iraq in his approach to the new European Commission . 
On the old commission headed by Romano Prodi , France was powerfully represented , with Pascal Lamy holding the trade portfolio . 
Lamy is widely acknowledged for his skill , his intellect , and his strong personality . 
Maintaining France &apos;s weight within the European Union should have led Chirac to re-confirm Lamy when José Manuel Barroso took over as President of the Commission . 
But , in Chirac &apos;s eyes , Lamy possessed two fatal flaws : he is a socialist , and he favors reform of the Common Agricultural Policy . 
Chirac , Georges Pompidou &apos;s agriculture minister in the 1970 &apos;s , wants to keep the CAP as it is . 
So Chirac replaced Lamy with Jacques Barrot , an honorable and experienced politician , but one with little knowledge of EU affairs and no language other than French . 
No surprise , then , that Barrot was given a minor role on a new European Commission that is liberal and Atlanticist , quite out of sync with French positions . 
Barrot received the transportation portfolio , a minor post far below the type of position - competition or domestic affairs - that Chirac demanded . 
True , Barroso offered Barrot the symbolic title of Commission Vice-President , but this is a mere consolation prize that doesn &apos;t fool anyone . 
Chirac &apos;s very character works against French influence in Europe . 
He seems to belong to an era when France considered Europe a &quot; French formal garden . &quot; 
He is nostalgic for the 1960 &apos;s and the Gaullist ideology that shaped both France and himself . 
These biases matter because they do not jibe with the enlarged Europe of today . 
France was a core part of Europe when the Union had only six members and reflected the primary goal of Franco-German reconciliation . 
The fall of the Berlin Wall changed all that . 
Of course , the French vision still plays a major part in today &apos;s Europe of 25 members ; our &quot; exceptionality &quot; - be it cultural or political - remains important , even if it is less well regarded . 
Given this change in European dynamics , France should have looked for new ways to assert influence . 
Instead , Chirac demeaned and sometimes humiliated his European partners , gradually rallying everyone against him . 
No one should be surprised that so contemptuous a French attitude , one utterly disdainful of the Union &apos;s Solidarity Pact and competition regulations , provoked a reaction detrimental to France . 
That contempt is also manifested in France &apos;s nominees to serve on the Commission . 
Unlike , for example , Great Britain , France rarely nominates young and talented persons capable of shaping the EU &apos;s future . 
Of course , this decline must not be overestimated . 
France remains a major European country : it is a founder of the Union , one of the world &apos;s richest nations , and holds a permanent seat on the UN Security Council . 
It defends , with its nuclear power , an autonomous and important foreign and defense policy . 
France represents values , a culture , and a history that grant it a durable global audience . 
It matters and will continue to matter in the European Council and the European Parliament . 
Moreover , France needs to avoid the temptation to overcompensate for the diminishing role of the Franco-German tandem , which may no longer be sufficient to power the Union , but nonetheless remains necessary . 
In this respect , the composition of the Barroso Commission worries me : the role given to my friend , the German Social Democrat Günter Verheugen , is no more enviable than that given to Barrot . 
A Commission that keeps France and Germany at bay and entrusts its major posts to representatives of &quot; small countries , &quot; to more liberal actors , and partisans of the American intervention in Iraq , will not be successful . 
This is why I cannot trust such a Commission . 
France will also have to reform its European strategy if it is to regain influence . 
I wish France could adopt a more humble attitude , show more respect for its partners and the EU &apos;s institutions , and view Europe as more than an extension of its own philosophy . 
Here I have no confidence in Jacques Chirac . 
Thankfully , his reign won &apos;t last forever . 
The decline of French influence in Europe is undeniable , but it is neither fatal nor desirable . 
It must be stopped . 
But this won &apos;t be achieved by invoking past glory . 
For the rising generation of French political leaders , the essential task is to spur France to lead a reunited Europe by working within it .
