Vladimir Putin &apos;s Soviet Dream 
MADRID - The recent nuclear deal concluded by six major world powers and Iran represented a triumph of multilateralism . 
If those same powers - the five permanent UN Security Council members and Germany - showed the same will to work together to resolve other disputes , the world might enter a new era of cooperation and stability . 
Unfortunately , such a scenario seems farfetched . 
From China &apos;s activities in the South China Sea to the Islamic State &apos;s continued advance in the Middle East , competition and conflict are threatening long-standing regional orders . 
But perhaps the most critical conflict - the one whose resolution has implications for all the rest - is in Ukraine , a country that has become central to Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s expansionist ambitions . 
Russia &apos;s unilateral annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine have ruptured its relations with the West , and Putin has intentionally recreated a Cold War atmosphere by touting Russia &apos;s &quot; conservative values &quot; as an ideological counterweight to the American-led liberal world order . 
Nonetheless , key issues - the carnage in Syria , the fight against the Islamic State , nuclear non-proliferation , and conflicting interests and competing claims in the Arctic - cannot be resolved without Russia &apos;s involvement . 
That is why , as hard as it may be for Western powers , some efforts to appease Russia are unavoidable . 
The United States should be less dismissive of Russia &apos;s sensibilities as an important power and a major civilization , and Russia &apos;s legitimate security interests concerning its borders with NATO countries must be addressed , not least to keep Ukraine out of a rival military alliance . 
The Ukrainian parliament &apos;s endorsement , despite strong international opposition , of autonomy for the pro-Russia separatist regions - a solution initially proposed by Putin - is exactly the kind of concession that is needed to restore peace . 
Ultimately , however , it is up to Russia to change its ways . 
Propaganda-driven nostalgia for the Soviet Union &apos;s Cold War-era &quot; great power &quot; status is obscuring the lessons of that time . 
The Soviet Union was an unsustainable empire ; if it could not survive at a time when isolation and bipolarity were the order of the day , it certainly could not be recreated within today &apos;s interconnected multipolar global system . 
Russia already is in no position to confront the West : Its economy is withering , and it lacks solid alliances capable of countering US power . 
Putin is hoping that Russia and its BRICS partners ( Brazil , India , China , and South Africa ) will become &quot; the future leaders of the world and the global economy , &quot; as he put it in July , at the conclusion of the BRICS and Shanghai Cooperation Organization summits 
But the plain truth is that neither the BRICS nor the SCO is remotely close to being a cohesive bloc capable of insulating Russia from the consequences of its behavior in Ukraine . 
The differences in values and strategic interests within the groupings are no less acute than the disagreements that their various members have with the West . 
Russia &apos;s bilateral relationship with China is no different . 
But the two countries have conflicting interests in Central Asia , where China is pursuing major investments to expand its influence in countries that Russia views as its &quot; near abroad . &quot; 
When Putin questioned Kazakhstan &apos;s independence last year , China was quick to support the country &apos;s sovereignty . 
China &apos;s potential encroachment on Russia &apos;s unpopulated Far East borders - which , in China &apos;s view , were stolen , much like Hong Kong and Taiwan , during its &quot; century of humiliation &quot; - is another source of anxiety in the Kremlin . 
More important , China &apos;s economy depends on continued access to Western - and especially US - markets . 
At a time when a slowing economy is creating greater uncertainty for China , it cannot afford to provoke tensions with the US over anything that is not in its direct interests , such as its territorial claims in the South China Sea . 
Despite Russia &apos;s weak alliances , Putin seems undeterred . 
Beyond his boastful talk about Russia &apos;s nuclear arsenal , his government has recently announced a new naval doctrine - one that amounts to an alarming echo of Germany &apos;s naval challenge to Britain prior to World War I. If no diplomatic d√©tente is brokered , Putin may well continue on this path , bringing his country ever closer to a full-blown conflict with NATO . 
Even if no such conflict erupts , Putin &apos;s attempts to restore Russian influence across Eurasia ( by whatever means necessary , if his actions in Ukraine are any indication ) will be highly damaging . 
It should be no surprise that Kazakhstan and Belarus are as wary of Russian expansionism as Ukraine . 
Putin has discarded former President Dmitri Medvedev &apos;s concept of a &quot; partnership for modernization &quot; with the West . 
But a Eurasian customs union among post-Soviet and other countries is not the road to modernization for Russia ; nor is an effort to make the defense industry the engine of industrialization . 
That , in a nutshell , was the Soviet model , which failed once and would fail again . 
If Putin is serious about diversifying and strengthening Russia &apos;s commodities-based economy , thereby improving the lives of his country &apos;s people , he must attract advanced technologies and foreign investment , especially from the West . 
For that , he must pursue democratic reforms , institutional regeneration , and renewed diplomatic ties with the West . 
Russia is in no position to create an alternative international system ; but , if Putin continues to pursue an outdated and antagonistic foreign policy , it can undermine the existing one . 
At a time when the world is facing so many destabilizing challenges , this would not be good for anyone . 
The West should seek to mollify Russia on core strategic questions like NATO expansion . 
But that will not help Putin to overcome the source of Russia &apos;s weakness , which lies in his inability or unwillingness to see the Soviet Union for the failure that it was .
