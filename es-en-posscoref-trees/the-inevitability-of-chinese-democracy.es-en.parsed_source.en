The Inevitability of Chinese Democracy 
Fifteen years ago , Fang Hongin was protesting in Tienanmen Square . 
A few years ago , in Beijing , he ran one of China &apos;s most popular TV shows , each week testing the limits of the authorities &apos; indulgence . 
Today , he runs Dragon TV , Shanghai &apos;s leading station , and advertisements featuring him hang from the city &apos;s skyscrapers . 
Hu Shuli belongs to the same generation : the journalist whom the Economist magazine calls &quot; China &apos;s most dangerous woman , &quot; moved from her first job , with the Party press , to editing Caijng , a business magazine that runs stories on corruption , exposing businessmen and public officials . 
It would be a mistake , however , to interpret these experiments with a free press as signs that democracy in China is near . 
The Party allows Caijng to expose corruption because this helps it to stop China &apos;s most serious disease . 
&quot; The first civil right is getting out of poverty , &quot; says Yongtu Long , one of China &apos;s WTO negotiators . 
&quot; In 15 years , we got 200 million people out of poverty ; 700 million Chinese today have access to electricity , an unknown luxury 15 years ago . 
This is why our priority is growth : everything else , frankly , is less important . &quot; 
Growth , however , does only mean getting people out of poverty . 
Twenty-five years ago , China had a more egalitarian society than Sweden ; today there is vast inequality between city and countryside , between the western provinces and those bordering the Pacific ocean , and within cities , which attract a constant flow of former peasants looking for jobs . 
Indeed , China &apos;s income distribution today looks more like that of Brazil than that of Sweden . 
But more inequality also means more opportunities : becoming rich today in China remains very difficult , but it is no longer impossible - just walk into one of the pubs of downtown Shanghai . 
Inequality can be accepted , but not if it is the fruit of corruption , and this remains China &apos;s foremost social problem , which the Party has been unable to eradicate , despite Caijng &apos; s expos√©s and the death penalty . 
Can China really do without democracy ? 
A few years ago , Fareed Zakaria , then an editor of Foreign Affairs , argued against the priority normally given to democracy , simply defined as the possibility of choosing political leaders through free elections . 
&quot; Elections are of little use if democratically elected governments limit the freedom of the press and the independence of the judiciary . &quot; 
&quot; There is certainly more freedom in Shanghai than in Moscow , &quot; says a professor from Tsinghua University in Beijing , echoing Zakaria . 
She is probably right , although India reminds us that sometimes elections are a powerful and effective mechanism to correct the path a country has taken . 
India &apos;s economy is growing almost as fast as China &apos;s , with a similar increase in inequality and , to some extent , corruption . 
But Indian voters have turned against this model . 
As a result , India &apos;s economy is likely to slow . 
It is hard to tell whether this is good or bad . 
It is probably bad in the short run , but who knows about the longer term ? 
The point is that questions such as , &quot; Are we creating too much inequality ? &quot; cannot even be asked in China . 
The upshot is that whenever a problem gets out of hand , the turnaround comes too late and is dramatic . 
This is why China cannot shelve the problem of its transition to democracy . 
Democracy is not only a mechanism to help prevent strategic mistakes . 
There is a more mundane reason why many , even within the Party , think that a democratic transition has become inevitable : the Party is simply losing control of the country . 
Deng Xiaoping was the last Chinese leader to possess undisputed authority to decide on public policy . 
Today , the Party &apos;s political bureau has more than 20 members and each resolution requires unanimity . 
More important decisions require an even larger consensus , involving up to 3,000 people . 
For example , the Party &apos;s main current activity is drafting the documents that will be approved at the next congress , scheduled for the autumn of 2007 . 
The difference between the economy &apos;s pace and that of the Party means that the country increasingly runs on its own . 
As in the past , when a dynasty weakens , the provinces make their own decisions . 
Even slowing the economy is hard : lacking an efficient financial system , credit growth must be controlled directly through banks . 
But the director of the Guangzhou office of China Construction Bank , China &apos;s largest , consults with the party leader of his province before executing the directives he receives from the bank &apos;s head office in Beijing . 
Considering these difficulties , some inside the Party admit that &quot; there is only one way forward : let someone be in charge , no matter how she or he is chosen , even through an election , provided effective decision-making is restored . &quot; 
So China &apos;s democratic transition may be closer than anyone realizes . 
But if it happens , it will not result from grassroots democratic experiments in towns and villages ; rather , it will be an elite-driven transition , careful to preserve the government &apos;s control . 
This is the only condition under which the People &apos;s Liberation Army and the all-powerful Military Commission will accept democratization .
