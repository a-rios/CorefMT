The Great Contraction of 2008-2009 
CAMBRIDGE - A popular view among economic forecasters and market bulls is that &quot; the deeper the recession , the quicker the recovery . &quot; 
They are right - up to a point : immediately after a normal recession , economies do , indeed , often grow much faster than usual over the ensuing twelve months . 
Unfortunately , the Great Recession of 2008-2009 is far from being a normal global recession . 
The Great Recession was turbo-charged by a financial crisis , making it a far more insidious affair that typically has far more long-lasting effects . 
As Carmen Reinhart and I argue in our new book This Time is Different : Eight Centuries of Financial Folly , the Great Recession is better described as &quot; The Great Contraction , &quot; given the massive and simultaneous contraction of global credit , trade , and growth that the world has experienced . 
Fortunately , despite a hobbled recovery in the developed world , emerging markets in Asia , Latin America , and the Middle East have enormous latent growth potential . 
Most should be able to grow strongly , despite the challenging global environment . 
Nevertheless , the legacy of the huge contraction in credit is not likely to go away anytime soon . 
Yes , if you are a bank , particularly a big one , you can raise money easily enough , thanks to sweeping explicit and implicit government guarantees . 
But , for everyone else , particularly small and medium-size firms , the credit environment continues to be very challenging . 
Even firms in established industries such as energy report facing great difficulties in raising capital . 
The optimists say not to worry . 
Credit will soon come to everyone else as easily as it has to the banks . 
After all , credit also dried up during the 1991 global recession , and yet funds were flowing briskly within 18 months . 
But this parallel fails to recognize the fact that balance sheets remain far more impaired this time . 
Housing prices are being propped up temporarily by myriad subsidies , while a commercial real-estate tsunami looms . 
Many banks &quot; weaknesses are simply being masked by government guarantees . 
Indeed , G-20 governments now face the daunting prospect of trying to rein in the monster they have created . 
It is now very clear that the taxpayer will always be there to guarantee that bondholders get paid . 
Unchecked , large financial firms will be able to tap bond markets for decades to come at rates just above what the government pays , regardless of the inherent risk of their asset positions . 
Lenders to banks will not bother worrying about what kinds of gambles and investments financial institutions are making , or whether regulation is effective . 
The good news is that most governments do see the need to implement significant new regulation on financial firms . 
But here &apos;s the rub : financial regulation is enormously complicated , all the more so given that there must be some degree of international consistency . 
It would be a disaster if countries were to rush in individually to implement their own new system . 
On the other hand , if regulators take their time to &quot; get it right , &quot; there will be a huge shadow of uncertainty hanging over the financial system . 
Banks know that they face higher capital requirements , which will force them to scale back lending relative to their resources ) . 
But how much higher ? 
There is much discussion of breaking up banks that are too big to fail . 
But what will actually happen ? 
Given this environment , no wonder credit is still contracting in the United States , Europe , and elsewhere . 
If banks don &apos;t know what the rules of the game are going to be , they have to be very cautious about over-extending their balance sheets . 
So government regulators - and ultimately all of us - are caught between a rock and a hard place . 
Regulate in haste , repent at leisure . 
Overly strict regulation could seriously impair global growth for decades . 
But if regulation is too soft , the next monster global financial crisis could come within a decade . 
And even if regulators take their time to try to get it right , as most of us think they should , the world may have to live with weak credit expansion as banks hold back , awaiting a clearer verdict on their future . 
And here is another painful thought that Harvard historian Niall Ferguson often emphasizes : many of the leaders and legislators who are passing judgment on new rules for banks are the same leaders and legislators who oversaw the regulation in the run-up to the financial crisis . 
I am often asked why economies get themselves into such a bind again and again throughout economic history . 
Unfortunately , as Reinhart and I document empirically for hundreds of financial crises , covering 66 countries and eight centuries , the answer is all too simple : arrogance and ignorance . 
Investors and policymakers are often altogether ignorant of the myriad historical experiences with financial crises . 
And the few that are dimly aware of what has happened in other times and other places all too often say , &quot; Don &apos;t worry , this time is different . &quot; 
Perhaps the Great Contraction of 2008-2009 will be different from other deep financial crises , and we will see a sustained sharp recovery worldwide . 
But G-20 policymakers are best advised not to bet on it , and to counsel patience , particularly in epicenter countries .
