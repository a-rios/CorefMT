Avoiding Algeria in Egypt 
PORTO - The military coup that has overthrown Egypt &apos;s first democratically elected president and led to the arrests of Muslim Brotherhood leaders across the country poses an enormous danger not only for Egypt &apos;s democratic transition , but for the democratic hopes of the entire Arab world as well . 
The fact that the coup was undertaken with massive popular support is a sign of the enormous difficulties faced by the Muslim Brotherhood during its first turn in power . 
President Mohamed Morsi &apos;s government struggled to address Egypt &apos;s inherited economic and social crises in the face of the enormous public expectations created by the 2011 revolution , whose protagonists sought not only freedom , but also economic development and social justice . 
Of course , the Muslim Brotherhood was also a victim of its own mistakes , particularly the failure of Morsi and his government to reach out to the secular opposition , elements of which had contributed to his election . 
The Morsi government seemed incapable of understanding that a slim electoral majority is not enough , especially nowadays . 
Indeed , the breadth of the opposition to Morsi reflects a major global tendency toward the empowerment of the educated and connected middle classes , whose members tend to be suspicious of political parties and demand more direct political participation . 
In this sense , Egypt &apos;s difficulties differ only in scope , not in kind , from those faced by governments in Turkey , Brazil , and even Europe . 
Morsi &apos;s Muslim Brotherhood dominated government from its first days in power . 
The judiciary , for example , dissolved the first elected legislative assembly . 
Likewise , the interior minister refused to protect the Brotherhood &apos;s headquarters from repeated attack . 
Moreover , some secular intellectuals demonized the Brotherhood . 
Like their Algerian counterparts - who in 1992 approved of the Algerian army &apos;s suppression of an Islamist electoral victory , leading to years of brutal fighting that left perhaps a half-million dead - many Egyptians didn &apos;t mind repressing Islamists . 
Morsi and the Brotherhood also faced competition from Saudi-backed Salafists . 
Indeed , on the night of the coup , these ultra-conservative Islamists appeared together with military leaders and the secular political leader Mohamed ElBaradei to announce Morsi &apos;s overthrow . 
The prospects for Egypt &apos;s democratic transition have become increasingly difficult to predict , but one thing is clear : the military cannot and must not be trusted . 
During the period after the fall of Mubarak , when the army exercised full power , 12,000 civilians were charged in military courts , virginity tests were imposed on women ( particularly those protesting against the military ) , demonstrators were killed , and myriad human-rights violations were committed with impunity . 
Of course , it is possible for soldiers to assure a transition to democracy , as they did four decades ago in my homeland , Portugal , following their overthrow of the Salazar / Caetano dictatorship . 
Moreover , in this case , the Egyptian army appears far more interested in protecting its enormous economic interests than it is in securing the benefits of a civilian government responsive to its citizens . 
Trust should still be put in young Egyptians and their demands for freedom and democracy - demands that link the movement that overthrew Mubarak to the demonstrations that led to Morsi &apos;s removal . 
Today , this requires opposition to any Mubarak-style repression of the Muslim Brotherhood . 
Immediately following the coup , the European Union adopted an ambivalent position toward it . 
This , too , is reminiscent of Algeria in 1992 , when most European governments supported the annulment of the Islamists &quot; electoral victory . 
( Likewise , the EU refused to recognize Hamas &apos;s electoral victory in Gaza in 2006 . ) 
Continuing fear of political Islam in much of the West explains past support for dictatorial regimes . 
Today , the EU and the US should demand the liberation of all members of the Muslim Brotherhood , including Morsi , and the integration of the Brotherhood into any political solution . 
The international community should also be concerned with the coup &apos;s regional implications . 
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s cynical declaration of support for the coup is a sign that some want to turn today &apos;s struggle in the Arab world into a bloody contest between Islamists and secularists . 
In the long term , any crackdown on the Brotherhood would lead its members and supporters - already bitterly disappointed in democracy - to reject elections entirely . 
That outcome could have a very negative impact on Islamist movements elsewhere . 
For many , the extremists who criticized the Brotherhood and other Islamist parties for choosing a democratic route to power will have been vindicated , and a new wave of violence in the region may begin . 
Hope remains that Egypt will not become Algeria in 1992 ( or Chile in 1973 ) . 
US President Barack Obama , who has expressed deep concern about the overthrow of Morsi , is perhaps the only leader able to mediate in such a situation and work for a consensus solution that prevents a civil war . 
To achieve this , he would need to use all of the leverage at his disposal , including cutting off the massive military assistance that the US provides to Egypt &apos;s armed forces , as he has threatened to do . 
He can also use the reserve of trust that he established by reaching out to the Brotherhood during Morsi &apos;s presidency . 
But will Obama take the initiative ? 
His speech in Cairo in 2009 - which called for &quot; A New Beginning &quot; in the region - inspired many in the Arab world . 
Now it is time for more than words .
