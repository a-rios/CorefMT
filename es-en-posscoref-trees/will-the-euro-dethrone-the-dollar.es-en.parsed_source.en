Will the Euro Dethrone the Dollar ? 
Much of America &apos;s dominance in world finance comes from the dollar &apos;s status as international money . 
America &apos;s commitment to free capital markets , the rule of law , and price stability confer credibility on the dollar as a store of value . 
But American spending habits have undermined the dollar &apos;s reputation , with the excess supply of dollars on world markets depressing its price . 
This spring , the euro &apos;s exchange rate against the dollar reached an all-time high , and central banks have increased the euro share of their international reserves . 
Is the dollar about to lose the crown of world finance to the euro ? 
History suggests otherwise , despite a vulnerable dollar . 
American financial supremacy in the twenty-first century resembles Britain &apos;s position in world finance a century ago . 
Before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , the pound sterling served as the currency of choice for international transactions , just as the dollar does today , and the world &apos;s borrowers visited the City of London to raise capital . 
The British economist John Maynard Keynes worried that countries would not use sterling to settle trading balances with each other if the pound were not viewed as a reliable store of value . 
The &quot; future position of the City of London , &quot; according to Keynes , depended on the pound sterling continuing to serve the business world as the equivalent of gold . 
Britain maintained the pound &apos;s convertibility into gold at the outbreak of the Great War to preserve its credibility as the international medium of exchange . 
The dollar could not challenge sterling &apos;s role as the world &apos;s currency without matching its reputation . 
August 1914 provided the opportunity . 
The biggest gold outflow in a generation imperiled America &apos;s ability to repay its debts abroad . 
Fear that the US would abandon the gold standard sent the dollar plummeting on world markets . 
But Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo secured American financial honor in August 1914 by remaining true to gold while everyone else , except for the British , abandoned their obligations . 
Despite the dollar &apos;s instant credibility , however , it took more than a decade for America &apos;s currency to match Britain &apos;s as an international medium of exchange . 
Payment habits melt at a glacier &apos;s pace . 
Britain &apos;s transformation from international creditor to international debtor during the Great War gave the dollar a second wind in its battle with sterling . 
The British were forced to abandon gold convertibility in April 1919 - a tactical withdrawal intended to pave the way for Britain &apos;s return to the former $ 4.8665 parity with the American dollar . 
Six years later , in April 1925 , Britain confirmed its monetary credibility and returned to the gold standard . 
But the pound had already suffered irreparable damage . 
The experience of 1914 implies that a credible alternative can replace an entrenched world currency , especially after an unfavorable balance of trade has weakened it . 
But even then , dethroning the reigning king of international exchange takes time . 
Today , the euro - a currency without a country - lacks a long track record of credibility . 
Thirteen countries in the European Union use the euro as money . 
But the commitment of these independent political entities to the euro cannot match the history of America &apos;s commitment to the dollar . 
The European Central Bank , established in 1998 , has a mandate to manage the new currency to maintain price stability . 
But the ECB needs time to establish its inflation-fighting credentials . 
It cannot hitch a ride on gold , the way America did a century ago . 
So the euro must earn its reputation crisis by crisis to confront the dollar &apos;s dominance as the currency of choice for international transactions . 
Recent experience with the euro as an official reserve asset is instructive . 
Between 2000 and 2005 , the dollar lost more than 25 % of its value against the euro . 
Meanwhile , the fraction of international reserves held in euros grew from 18 % to 24 % , and the dollar &apos;s share dropped from 71 % to 66 % . 
In short , the euro has clearly made some headway during this period of US balance of payment deficits , but this reflects an evolutionary decline in the dollar &apos;s dominance , not a revolutionary regime shift . 
What might trigger a fatal run on the dollar in world markets ? 
While a broad and abrupt sell-off by major foreign holders of dollars - for example , China - appears unlikely , a cataclysmic event , similar to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914 , could prompt a search for a new international medium of exchange . 
In the modern era of automated payments , the upheaval might come from a terrorist attack that undermines the computerized transfer facilities of the world &apos;s banking system . 
A catastrophic loss of electronic records could surely destroy the credibility of the dollar as the international medium of exchange . 
But exactly what would replace the dollar under such circumstances remains an open question . 
After all , a loss of computer records would make the euro equally suspect . 
Perhaps gold , a store of value impervious to physical distortion , could make a comeback . 
Of course , one can only hope that such a scenario remains pure conjecture .
