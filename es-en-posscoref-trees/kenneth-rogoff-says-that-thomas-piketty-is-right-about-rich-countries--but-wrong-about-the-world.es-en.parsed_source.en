Where Is the Inequality Problem ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Reading Thomas Piketty &apos;s influential new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century , one might conclude that the world has not been this unequal since the days of robber barons and kings . 
That is odd , because one might conclude from reading another excellent new book , Angus Deaton &apos;s The Great Escape ( which I recently reviewed ) , that the world is more equal than ever . 
Which view is right ? 
The answer depends on whether one looks only at countries individually or at the world as a whole . 
The overarching fact in Deaton &apos;s book is that over the last few decades , several billion people in the developing world , particularly in Asia , have escaped truly desperate levels of poverty . 
The same machine that has increased inequality in rich countries has leveled the playing field globally for billions . 
Looking from afar , and giving , say , an Indian the same weight as an American or a Frenchman , the last 30 years have been among the greatest in human history for improving the lot of the poor . 
Piketty &apos;s brilliant book documents within-country inequality , with the main focus being on the rich world . 
Much of the cultural groundswell surrounding his book has come from people who view themselves as middle class within their own countries , but who are upper middle class or even rich by global standards . 
There are various arcane technical debates surrounding the facts that Piketty has established over the past 15 years with his co-author Emmanuel Saez . 
But I find their results persuasive , especially given that other authors , using completely different methods , have reached similar conclusions . 
Brent Neiman and Loukas Karabarbounis of the University of Chicago , for example , argue that labor &apos;s share of GDP has been declining globally since the 1970 &quot; s . 
However , Piketty and Saez do not really offer a model ; nor does this new book . 
And the lack of a model , combined with a focus on the world &apos;s upper-middle-class countries , matters a lot when it comes to policy prescriptions . 
Would Piketty &apos;s followers be nearly as enthusiastic about his proposed progressive global wealth tax if it were aimed at correcting the huge disparities between the richest countries and the poorest , instead of between those who are well off by global standards and the ultra-wealthy ? 
Piketty argues that capitalism is unfair . 
Wasn &apos;t colonialism unfair , too ? 
In any event , the idea of a global wealth tax is replete with credibility and enforcement problems , aside from being politically implausible . 
Though Piketty is right that returns to capital have increased in the last few decades , he is too dismissive of the wide-ranging debate among economists concerning the causes . 
For example , if the main driver is the massive influx of Asian labor into globalized trade markets , the growth model put forth by the Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow suggests that eventually capital stocks will adjust and the wage rate will rise . 
If , on the other hand , labor &apos;s share of income is falling because of the inexorable rise of automation , downward pressures on that share will continue , as I discussed in the context of artificial intelligence a few years ago . 
Fortunately , there are much better ways to address rich-country inequality while still fostering long-term growth in demand for products from developing countries . 
For example , a shift to a relatively flat consumption tax ( with a large deductible for progressivity ) would be a far simpler and more effective way to tax past wealth accumulation , especially if citizens &quot; tax home can be linked to the locale where their income was earned . 
A progressive consumption tax is relatively efficient and does not distort savings decisions as much as today &apos;s income taxes do . 
Why try to move to an improbable global wealth tax when alternatives are available that are growth friendly , raise significant revenue , and can be made progressive through a very high exemption . 
In addition to a global wealth tax , Piketty recommends an 80 % marginal tax rate on income for the United States . 
Though I strongly believe that the US needs more progressive taxation , particularly of the top 0.1 % , I don &apos;t understand why he assumes that an 80 % rate would not cause significant distortions , especially as this assumption contradicts a large body of work by the Nobel laureates Thomas Sargent and Edward Prescott . 
There are many practical policies that can be adopted to reduce inequality , in addition to a progressive consumption tax . 
Focusing on the US , Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard University has suggested the elimination of payroll taxes for low-income workers , a cut in deductions for high-income workers , and higher inheritance taxes . 
Universal pre-school education would enhance long-term growth , as would a much greater emphasis on lifetime adult education ( my addition ) , possibly via online courses . 
Carbon taxes would help mitigate global warming while raising considerable revenues . 
In accepting Piketty &apos;s premise that inequality matters more than growth , one needs to remember that many developing-country citizens rely on rich-country growth to help them escape poverty . 
The first problem of the twenty-first century remains to help the dire poor in Africa and elsewhere . 
By all means , the elite 0.1 % should pay much more in taxes , but let us not forget that when it comes to reducing global inequality , the capitalist system has had an impressive three decades .
