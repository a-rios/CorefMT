Capitalist Meltdown 
PARIS - There is a strange foreboding in the world economy . 
Newspapers report downward revisions in growth estimates for all the major developed countries : the United States , Germany , France , Japan . 
No one , it seems , is being left out . 
Indeed , these estimates are roughly half a percentage point lower than those issued only last autumn . 
At the same time , newspapers report in bleak terms almost exclusively about banks and financial markets , with little attention to the real economy , as if today &apos;s crisis were purely financial and bound to remain so . 
Indeed , some experts , too , believe that the crisis can be resolved simply by refinancing banks , and that the impact on the real economy will be relatively limited . 
This is clearly the belief of the European Central Bank , which is pumping hundreds of billions of euros into the banking system to ensure liquidity . 
But , unlike the US Federal Reserve , it has not lowered key interest rates , which is what matters most to firms and households . 
Other experts , of course , believe that the real economy is in jeopardy , and that the threat of a recession is genuine . 
But , unfortunately , hardly any experts can speak with confidence about both finance and macroeconomics . 
So what is a non-expert to think ? 
It is helpful to review where the world economy now stands . 
The largest number of defaults on sub-prime mortgages will occur this spring . 
So the full impact of the crisis remains ahead of us : 1.3 million American homeowners have already defaulted on their mortgages . 
In 2008 , another three million will join them . 
Moreover , the size of the bad debt threatening banks remains unknown , and could amount to several hundred billion dollars . 
The total sum of assets now under threat is even more important , because mortgages have been mixed up with other kinds of securities , and these &quot; packages &quot; have been sold throughout the world . 
A US subsidiary of Deutsche Bank , for example , has been barred by an American court from foreclosing on a house because it could not demonstrate ownership . 
The global economy is overrun with such poisoned packages . 
As a result , banks distrust one another and have mostly stopped lending to each other , which jeopardizes economic activity by severely reducing the availability of credit to businesses . 
As a result , recession seems certain . 
The quantity of liquidity in the world economy is surprising , and monetary expansion by central banks does not explain it completely . 
For more than two decades , shareholders in all the developed countries , unorganized and passive from 1945 until 1975-1980 , have recast themselves in the form of pension funds , investment funds , and hedge funds . 
Now they are significant and active players ( as majorities or strong minorities ) in all the big companies of the developed world . 
To boost the value of their shares , these shareholders backed the drive to reduce the global volume of the payroll and the number of workers that companies employ . 
Indeed , in the last 25 years , the share of direct and indirect wages as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 8 % to 11 % in all the countries involved . 
As a result , precarious employment and job insecurity , which hardly existed between 1940 and 1970 , now affect more than 15 % of the developed world &apos;s population . 
The average real wage has been flat in the US for 20 years , with 1 % of the population capturing all of the gains brought about by a 50 % growth in GDP during this period . 
This &quot; liberated &quot; a lot of liquidity for financial activities , gambling , and speculation . 
In France alone over the past 20 years , roughly 2.5 trillion euros have poured into the financial world , which suggests a total of 30-60 trillion dollars for the world economy as a whole . 
This has been accompanied by a growing immorality of the system . 
Remuneration of company bosses now reaches 300 to 500 times the average salary of rank-and-file employees , up from 40 to one for the century and a half before 1980 . 
Throughout the world , the number of companies facing legal problems for various types of fraud is growing dramatically . 
The worst , sadly , is yet to come . 
Because most people &apos;s incomes are stagnant and being eroded as their mortgage payments rise , consumption is bound to fall , yielding lower growth and employment . 
A recession will only increase job precariousness and unemployment , creating social tensions that will not , of course , help to ease the financial crisis . 
All the ingredients seem to be in place for a long and powerful perfect storm of economic decline and social unrest . 
We in the developed world live in democracies . 
Every four or five years , the legitimacy of the system needs to be confirmed by elections . 
But is the system being so delegitimized by the economic and social turmoil that elections will no longer be viable ? 
Of course , capitalism remains more compatible with personal freedom than communism ever was . 
But it is now blindingly obvious that capitalism is too unstable to survive without strong public regulation . 
That is why , after years of being neglected as a viable option , it is time for the social-democratic project to return to the political fore .
