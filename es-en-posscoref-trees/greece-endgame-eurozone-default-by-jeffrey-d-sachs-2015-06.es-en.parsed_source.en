The Endgame in Greece 
PARIS - After months of wrangling , the showdown between Greece and its European creditors has come down to a standoff over pensions and taxes . 
Greece is refusing to acquiesce to demands by its creditors that it cut payments to the elderly and raise the value-added tax on their medicine and electricity . 
Europe &apos;s demands - ostensibly aimed at ensuring that Greece can service its foreign debt - are petulant , naive , and fundamentally self-destructive . 
In rejecting them , the Greeks are not playing games ; they are trying to stay alive . 
Whatever one might say about Greece &apos;s past economic policies , its uncompetitive economy , its decision to join the eurozone , or the errors that European banks made when they provided its government with excessive credit , the country &apos;s economic plight is stark . 
Unemployment stands at 25 % . 
Youth unemployment is at 50 % . 
Greece &apos;s GDP , moreover , has shrunk by 25 % since the start of the crisis in 2009 . 
Its government is insolvent . 
Many of its citizens are hungry . 
Conditions in Greece today are reminiscent of those in Germany in 1933 . 
Of course , the European Union need not fear the rise of a Greek Hitler , not only because it could easily crush such a regime , but also - and more important - because Greece &apos;s democracy has proved impressively mature throughout the crisis . 
But there is something that the EU should fear : destitution within its borders and the pernicious consequences for the continent &apos;s politics and society . 
Unfortunately , the continent remains split along tribal lines . 
Germans , Finns , Slovaks , and Dutch - among others - have no time for the suffering of Greeks . 
Their political leaders tend to their own , not to Europe in any true sense . 
Relief for Greece is an especially fraught issue in countries where far-right parties are on the rise or center-right governments face popular left-wing opposition . 
To be sure , European politicians are not blind to what is happening in Greece . 
Nor have they been completely passive . 
At the beginning of the crisis , Greece &apos;s European creditors eschewed debt relief and charged punitive interest rates on bailout funds . 
But , as Greeks &quot; suffering intensified , policymakers pressed private-sector banks and other bondholders to write off most of their claims . 
At each stage of the crisis , they have done only what they believed their national politics would bear - no more . 
In particular , Europe &apos;s politicians are balking at steps that would implicate taxpayers directly . 
The Greek government has asked Europe to swap existing debts with new debts to lock in low interest rates and long maturities . 
It has also requested that interest payments be linked to economic growth . 
( It has notably not asked for cuts in the face value of its debt ) . 
But debt relief of this sort vis-Ã -vis European governments or the European Central Bank has been kept off the table . 
Such measures would likely require parliamentary votes in countries across the eurozone , where many governments would face intense public opposition - no matter how obvious the need . 
Rather than confront the political obstacles , Europe &apos;s leaders are hiding behind a mountain of pious , nonsensical rhetoric . 
Some insist that Greece finish its payment program , regardless of the humanitarian and economic consequences - not to mention the failure of all previous Greek governments to meet its terms . 
Others pretend to worry about the moral-hazard implications of debt relief , despite the fact that the country &apos;s private-sector debt has already been written off at EU insistence , and that there are dozens , if not hundreds , of precedents for restructuring the debts of insolvent sovereigns . 
Almost a century ago , at World War I &apos;s end , John Maynard Keynes offered a warning that holds great relevance today . 
Then , as now , creditor countries ( mainly the US ) were demanding that deeply indebted countries make good on their debts . 
Keynes knew that a tragedy was in the making . 
&quot; Will the discontented peoples of Europe be willing for a generation to come so to order their lives that an appreciable part of their daily produce may be available to meet a foreign payment ? &quot; he asked in The Economic Consequences of the Peace . 
&quot; In short , I do not believe that any of these tributes will continue to be paid , at the best , for more than a few years . &quot; 
Several European countries now seem content to force Greece into an outright default and provoke its exit from the euro . 
They believe that the fallout can be contained without panic or contagion . 
That is typical wishful thinking among politicians . 
Indeed , it is the type of heedlessness that led US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to let Lehman Brothers fail in September 2008 , ostensibly to teach the market a &quot; lesson . &quot; 
Some lesson ; we are still digging out from Paulson &apos;s monumental mistake . 
Similarly , Keynes watched in horror as economic policymakers blundered repeatedly in the years following WWI , through the upheavals of the 1920s , and into the Great Depression of the 1930s . 
In 1925 , Keynes criticized the insouciance of those &quot; who sit in the top tier of the machine . &quot; 
He argued &quot; that they are immensely rash in their regardlessness , in their vague optimism and comfortable belief that nothing really serious ever happens . 
Nine times out of ten , nothing really serious does happen - merely a little distress to individuals or to groups . 
But we run a risk of the tenth time ... &quot; 
Today , Greece &apos;s European creditors seem ready to abandon their solemn pledges on the irrevocability of the euro in order to insist on collecting some crumbs from the country &apos;s pensioners . 
Should they press their demands , forcing Greece to exit , the world will never again trust the euro &apos;s longevity . 
At a minimum , the eurozone &apos;s weaker members will undergo increased market pressures . 
In the worst case , they will be hit by a new vicious circle of panic and bank runs , also derailing the incipient European recovery . 
With Russia testing Europe &apos;s resolve to the east , the timing of Europe &apos;s gamble could not be worse . 
The Greek government is right to have drawn the line . 
It has a responsibility to its citizens . 
The real choice , after all , lies not with Greece , but with Europe .
