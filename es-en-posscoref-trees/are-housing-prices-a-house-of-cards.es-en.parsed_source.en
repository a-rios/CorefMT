Are Housing Prices a House of Cards ? 
The first big city to boom was London , starting around 1996 . 
Boom mentality spread to Los Angeles , New York , and Sydney around 1997 , to Paris in 1998 , to Miami , Moscow , and Shanghai in 2001 , and Vancouver around 2002 . 
These and other cities have been booming pretty much ever since ; prices in most are up at least 50 % in real terms since 2000 . 
This has been a big windfall to homeowners , but has hurt anyone planning to buy . 
Now growth in home prices is weakening in some of these cities . 
The rate of price growth in London and New York slowed sharply over the past year , to only about a 1 % real increase in the second quarter of 2004 . 
In Sydney , home prices actually fell in the second quarter . 
Has the boom ended ? 
Will no other cities benefit ? 
Worse still , could the mood in housing markets soon lead prices in downward ? 
No one predicted this boom , so predicting its end is risky . 
Housing prices have shown tremendous upward momentum in the face of previous warnings that the party is over . 
Any prediction concerning the boom &apos;s end requires understanding why it occurred in so many places . 
Surprisingly , there is no well-received explanation , because this boom &apos;s ultimate causes are mostly psychological . 
Economists would rather talk about interest rates or unemployment statistics - factors that are concrete and knowable . 
Of course , these indicators do have a legitimate role to play in explaining housing markets , but they are simply not adequate to account for the recent booms . 
Three psychological causes stand out : first , a change in people &apos;s perceptions about the source of value in a changing world economy ; second , increasing public faith in &quot; glamour &quot; cities with international name recognition ; and third , the plain giddy dynamics of speculative bubbles . 
Each factor deserves greater attention if we are to understand current housing market conditions and discern future price trends . 
First , the world economy does look more chaotic than it did a decade ago . 
The crash in equity prices since 2000 in most countries has made financial assets look less secure , spurring a &quot; flight to quality &quot; - in this case , housing . 
Moreover , terrorism is now viewed as a problem for everyone , with major tragedies in Indonesia , Spain , and Russia . 
People feel safest investing in their homes , and there is little reason to expect imminent change . 
Fear and upward momentum in home prices go together . 
Second , the public &apos;s faith in glamorous international cities has increased with the explosive growth in global communications due to the Internet and the cell phone . 
Just as people increasingly admire international celebrities , so they believe that world famous centers of business , technology , and culture - whose names are household words to people everywhere - are uniquely valuable . 
As with fear of terrorism and suspicion of equities , geographical celebrity appears resilient , if not self-reinforcing : the more famous New York , Paris , and London get , the more glamorous they become . 
Third , and no less important , is the speculative contagion that underlies any bubble . 
The current boom has seen contagion 
In contrast to the other two psychological causes , speculative contagion has a natural end . 
A speculative bubble , sustaining itself solely by reaction to price increases , cannot go on forever . 
So , where does this leave us ? 
Two of the three psychological causes suggest continued upward momentum in housing prices , while the third suggests that the momentum will come to an end some day , but does not pinpoint when . 
I am betting that some high-flying glamour cities will continue to see decelerating growth in home prices - and eventually decreases . 
Historically , housing prices have shown a lot of momentum , and prices in all these cities are still going up at a brisk rate , though usually somewhat slower than a year or more ago . 
Based on extrapolation of growth trends , it looks safe to predict that prices will go up substantially in most of these places for another year or more , even as the rate of increase continues to decline . 
The psychological factors are more important for longer-term forecasts , beyond a year , where momentum no longer plays an important role . 
At this point , there is likely to be some downward instability in prices , because enthusiasm for investing in houses is likely to wane in line with declining price growth . 
Prices in glamour cities are likely to drop sharply the next time there is a serious recession , or if the local economy suffers a severe shock , or if interest rates rise too fast . 
Then , contagion within and across markets can work in a downward direction , propelling prices lower for years .
