China &apos;s Democratic Baby Steps 
WASHINGTON , DC - During the state visit to the United States of Chinese President Hu Jintao , President Barack Obama pressed Hu on human rights . 
He probably should have asked more about spreading democracy in China , because he might have been surprised by what he heard . 
In September 2010 , Hu gave a speech in Hong Kong in which he called for new thinking about Chinese democracy . 
He said , &quot; There is a need to ... hold democratic elections according to the law ; have democratic decision-making , democratic management as well as democratic supervision ; safeguard people &apos;s right to know , to participate , to express , and to supervise . &quot; 
His remarks elaborated on previous comments by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , delivered in Shenzhen , the coastal free-enterprise zone where China &apos;s economic revolution began . 
Wen said that political reform , including opportunities for citizens to criticize and monitor the government , is necessary to sustain China &apos;s breakneck economic growth . 
Otherwise , he argued , the country &apos;s economic gains would be lost . 
Wen &apos;s remarks led to speculation that Shenzhen , which set the pace for China &apos;s economic development , could soon become a &quot; special political zone . &quot; 
China experts noted that a next step could be direct elections for the chiefs of the Special Economic Zone &apos;s six districts . 
Most non-Chinese would be surprised to learn that the country already holds more elections than any other in the world . 
Under the Organic Law of the Village Committees , all of China &apos;s approximately one million villages - home to roughly 600 million voters - hold local elections every three years . 
Critics scoff that local Communist Party officials manipulate these elections . 
But , according to research by Robert Benewick , a professor at the University of Sussex in England , village elections have been growing more competitive , with a greater number of independent candidates and increasing use of the secret ballot . 
For those elections that have been genuinely competitive , researchers claim to have found evidence of positive effects . 
For example , in a study that looked at 40 villages over 16 years , the economist Yao Yang found that the introduction of elections had led to increased spending on public services by 20 % , while reducing spending on &quot; administrative costs &quot; - bureaucratese for corruption - by 18 % . 
And Wen has indicated that village elections might be extended to the next highest government level - township administrations - over the next few years . 
China &apos;s modest experiments with local elections have been supplemented by exercises in &quot; deliberative democracy . &quot; 
These take the form of high-tech town hall meetings . 
The Zeguo exercise was considered hugely successful , and has been replicated elsewhere in China . 
Professor Yu Keping , an influential Communist official and author of a prominent book called Democracy Is a Good Thing , is said to have the ear of President Hu . 
Professor Yu and others have been nudging democracy forward within the Communist Party itself . 
Competitive elections for lower-level party posts have already been held , with votes for provincial and national party congresses showing electoral slates with 15-30 % more candidates than positions . 
Since the Communist Party has a membership of 73 million people , such a &quot; democratic vanguard &quot; holds great potential . 
If internal elections become widespread , the lines of ideological disagreement within elite circles might become more clearly drawn , which could further spur calls for some kind of representative institutional structure . 
Rapid change in China already has resulted in a battle of ideas , pitting the coasts and cities against the countryside and inland provinces , and the rich against the poor . 
Of course , as Chinese democracy develops , it is unlikely to replicate the Western model . 
Confucian-inspired intellectuals like Jiang Qing , for example , have put forward an innovative proposal for a tricameral legislature . 
Legislators in one chamber would be selected on the basis of merit and competency , and in the others on the basis of elections of some kind . 
One elected chamber might be reserved only for Communist Party members , the other for representatives elected by ordinary Chinese . 
Such a tricameral legislature , its proponents believe , would better ensure that political decisions are made by more educated and enlightened representatives , thereby avoiding the rank populism of Western-style elected factions . 
It is intriguing to contemplate China embracing some sort of innovative democratic experiment , combining tricameralism with deliberative democracy methods to mold a new separation of powers - and thus a new type of political accountability . 
Former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was quoted in 1987 as saying that there would be national elections in 50 years . 
China &apos;s democratic trajectory generates little fanfare , but it may actually deliver on Deng &apos;s promise ahead of schedule .
