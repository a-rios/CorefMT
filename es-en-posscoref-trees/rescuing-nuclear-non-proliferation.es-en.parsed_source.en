Rescuing Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
As a declared non-nuclear weapon state , Indonesia has always striven for nuclear non-proliferation - indeed , for a world free of nuclear weapons . 
But the cause of nuclear non-proliferation is now in deep trouble , as countries are once again tempted to acquire the means of oblivion . 
For over three decades , the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) has been the cornerstone of the world &apos;s non-proliferation regime , a position that derives from growing acknowledgement of the legal and normative standards that it established . 
Adherence to the NPT has increased steadily , reaching a stage of near universal acceptance . 
But there is a general feeling that implementation has fallen short of expectations , particularly with regard to nuclear disarmament . 
Moreover , there is increasing concern over non-compliance and the associated risks of proliferation - to worrisome states , particularly in Asia , and , even more ominously , into the hands of private individuals and terrorist organizations . 
In the face of these threats , what can be done to strengthen the non-proliferation regime ? 
The NPT regime stands on three pillars : non-proliferation , nuclear disarmament , and peaceful uses of nuclear energy . 
The Treaty envisages the construction of each pillar through a matching series of steps taken by both nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states . 
Strengthening the non-proliferation regime in order to confront today &apos;s challenges would require no more than following this strategy . 
Unfortunately , this has not been the case since 1995 , when the NPT Review and Extension Conference made the duration of the NPT &apos;s validity indefinite . 
The Conference , which included the original five nuclear weapon states ( the United States , Russia , China , France , and Great Britain ) as well as a great number of other UN members , did not reach consensus on a &quot; Final Declaration . &quot; 
But it did adopt three other decisions , entitled Strengthening the Review Process for the Treaty , Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament , and Resolution on the Middle East . 
These constituted a unified package that was meant to be implemented in its entirety . 
Five years later , the 2000 Review Conference finally adopted a Final Document , which contained concrete measures , including &quot; 13 practical steps &quot; for systematic and progressive efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament . 
The evolution of the NPT - its adaptation to new environments and problems that were not anticipated at the time of its adoption - appeared to ensure the Treaty &apos;s continuing effective implementation . 
But actions speak louder than words , and challenges to the NPT regime have continued to undermine its basic principles , causing considerable backsliding . 
Today , the challenges posed by proliferation are more complex than ever : 
· proliferation of nuclear weapons technologies by one de facto nuclear-capable state ; 
· one stated withdrawal from the NPT ; 
· one case of non-compliance ; 
· increasing assertion of the role of nuclear weapons in military doctrines ; 
· improvements in nuclear weapons by some nuclear weapon states . 
The possibility that non-state actors could acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction poses an especially grave new threat . 
Confronting it effectively will require the support of all NPT signatories . 
But a continuing imbalance and selectivity in the emphasis placed by different states on the Treaty &apos;s three pillars damages the unity that the NPT regime needs . 
In particular , imbalances in implementing the NPT obligations by the nuclear haves and have-nots are sharpening . 
For example , some countries want to develop smaller and &quot; usable &quot; nuclear weapons designed for pre-emptive or preventive military action . 
Many non-nuclear weapon states , particularly those from the developing world , remain frustrated with the fact that peaceful nuclear cooperation is yet to be fully realized . 
These challenges to the non-proliferation regime not only jeopardize the credibility , efficacy , and viability of the Treaty ; they have also cast a long shadow of doubt on the future of nuclear disarmament itself . 
Deliberations and negotiations both within the NPT regime and in other areas of disarmament have reached a difficult stage , if not a stalemate . 
To jump-start progress , all NPT signatories should re-affirm that the Treaty &apos;s provisions are mutually reinforcing and must be pursued jointly and faithfully . 
The most dangerous force eroding the Treaty &apos;s credibility is the inclination of some nuclear-weapon states to reinterpret at will the package of agreements reached in the past . 
Despite the NPT &apos;s shortcomings , the overwhelming majority of non-nuclear states fully comply with their Treaty obligations . 
This constrains the number of nuclear weapon states , thus fulfilling one of the NPT &apos;s most important goals . 
One of the best ways to strengthen the non-proliferation regime now would be to implement fully the agreements that have already been reached . 
Selectivity and narrow reinterpretation can only weaken the Treaty . 
Developing a new set of non-proliferation mechanisms would be a waste time that we cannot afford , because any new protocol would have a dubious legal basis and encourage further imbalances in implementation . 
If we are serious about saving the non-proliferation regime , the time to act is now .
