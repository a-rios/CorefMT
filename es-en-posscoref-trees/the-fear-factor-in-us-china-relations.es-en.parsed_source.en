The Fear Factor in US-China Relations 
Opinion polls indicate that one-third of Americans believe that China will &quot; soon dominate the world , &quot; while nearly half view China &apos;s emergence as a &quot; threat to world peace . &quot; 
In turn , many Chinese fear that the United States will not accept their &quot; peaceful rise . &quot; 
Americans and Chinese must avoid such exaggerated fears . 
Maintaining good US-China relations will be a key determinant of global stability in this century . 
Perhaps the greatest threat to the bilateral relationship is the belief that conflict is inevitable . 
Throughout history , whenever a rising power creates fear among its neighbors and other great powers , that fear becomes a cause of conflict . 
In such circumstances , seemingly small events can trigger an unforeseen and disastrous chain reaction . 
Today , the greatest prospect of a destabilizing incident lies in the complex relationships across the Taiwan Strait . 
China , which regards Taiwan as an integral part of its territory that has sheltered behind the US navy since the days of the Chinese civil war , vows that any Taiwanese declaration of independence will be met by force . 
The US does not challenge China &apos;s sovereignty , but it wants a peaceful settlement that will maintain Taiwan &apos;s democratic institutions . 
In Taiwan itself , there is a growing sense of national identity , but a sharp division between pragmatists of the &quot; pan-blue alliance , &quot; who realize that geography will require them to find a compromise with the mainland , and the ruling &quot; pan-green alliance , &quot; which aspires in varying degrees to achieve independence . 
The two sides in Taiwan will face off in a presidential election on March 22 . 
Current polls suggest that former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) leads Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) . 
But some observers fear that the incumbent DPP President Chen Shui-bian will seek a pretext to prevent a defeat for the pro-sovereignty camp . 
He is currently advocating a referendum on whether Taiwan should join the United Nations , which China views as provocative . 
Chen replies that it is China &quot; that is acting provocatively today . &quot; 
America is clearly concerned . 
Recently , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told a news conference that &quot; we think that Taiwan &apos;s referendum to apply to the UN under the name &quot; Taiwan &quot; is a provocative policy . 
It unnecessarily raises tensions in the Taiwan Strait and it promises no real benefits for the people of Taiwan on the international stage . &quot; 
She also reiterated the administration policy opposing &quot; unilateral threat by either side to change the status quo . &quot; 
The same day , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized China for unexpectedly curtailing American ship visits to Chinese ports because of American arms sales to Taiwan . 
According to Gates , he had told Chinese officials that American arms sales were consistent with past policy and that &quot; as long as they continued to build up their forces on their side of the Taiwan Strait , we would continue to give Taiwan the resources necessary to defend itself . &quot; 
Gates added , however , that despite China &apos;s rising defense budget , &quot; I don &apos;t consider China an enemy , and I think there are opportunities for continued cooperation in a number of areas . &quot; 
In principle , the Taiwan issue need not lead to conflict . 
With increasing change in China and growing economic and social contacts across the strait , it should be possible to find a formula that allows the Taiwanese to maintain their market economy and democratic system without a placard at the UN . 
Thus far , the US has tried to allow for this evolution by stressing two bright lines : no independence for Taiwan and no use of force by China . 
But , given the danger of incidents that could grow out of political competition in Taiwan or growing impatience in the Peoples &quot; Liberation Army on the mainland , the US would be wise to encourage more active contacts and negotiations by the two sides . 
The US has a broad national interest in maintaining good relations with China , as well as a specific human rights interest in protecting Taiwan &apos;s democracy . 
The US does not have a national interest in helping Taiwan become a sovereign country with a seat at the UN , and efforts by some Taiwanese to do so present the greatest danger of a miscalculation that could create enmity between the US and China . 
Already , some Chinese suspect the US of seeking an independent Taiwan as an &quot; unsinkable aircraft carrier &quot; for use against a future Chinese enemy . 
They are wrong , but such suspicions can feed a climate of enmity . 
If America treats China as an enemy today , it will ensure future enmity . 
While we cannot be sure how China will evolve , it makes no sense to foreclose the prospect of a better future . 
America &apos;s current policy combines economic integration with a hedge against future uncertainty . 
The US-Japan security alliance means China cannot play a &quot; Japan card . &quot; 
But , while such hedging is natural in world politics , modesty is important for both sides . 
If the overall climate is one of distrust , what looks like a hedge to one side can look like a threat to the other . 
There is no need for the US and China to go to war in this century . 
Both sides must take care that an incident concerning Taiwan does not lead in that direction . 
Americans and Chinese must avoid letting exaggerated fears create a self-fulfilling prophecy .
