The Streets of 2012 
NEW YORK - What does the New Year hold for the global wave of protest that erupted in 2011 ? 
Did the surge of anger that began in Tunisia crest in lower Manhattan , or is 2012 likely to see an escalation of the politics of dissent ? 
The answers are alarming but quite predictable : we are likely to see much greater centralization of top-down suppression - and a rash of laws around the developed and developing world that restrict human rights . 
But we are also likely to see significant grassroots reaction . 
What we are witnessing in the drama of increasingly globalized protest and repression is the subplot that many cheerleaders for neoliberal globalization never addressed : the power of globalized capital to wreak havoc with the authority of democratically elected governments . 
From the perspective of global corporate interests , closed societies like China are more business-friendly than troublesome democracies , where trade unions , high standards of human-rights protection , and a vigorous press increase costs . 
All over the world , the pushback against protest looks similar , suggesting that state and corporate actors are learning &quot; best practices &quot; for repressing dissent while maintaining democratic facades . 
In the United Kingdom , Prime Minister David Cameron routinely impugns human-rights laws ; the Metropolitan Police have sought authority to use baton rounds - foot-long projectiles that have caused roughly a dozen deaths , including that of children , in Northern Ireland - on peaceful protesters ; and a police report on the threat of terrorism , distributed to &quot; trusted partners &quot; among London businesses , included updates about Occupy protests and referred to &quot; suspected activists . &quot; 
The UK has stringent internal-security legislation , but it never had a law like the United States Patriot Act . 
After anti-austerity protests in early 2011 , followed by riots in major cities in August , the Metropolitan Police claimed powers to monitor private social-media accounts and smartphones . 
And , under the guise of protecting this summer &apos;s Olympics against terrorism , the British military is establishing a massive base in London from which SAS ( special forces ) teams will operate - a radical departure from Britain &apos;s traditional civil policing . 
In Israel , Ha &apos;aretz reports that Occupy-type protests have been met with police violence , including a beating of a 15-year-old girl , and threats of random arrest . 
Israel , like Britain , has seen a push , seemingly out of nowhere , to enact new laws crippling newsgathering and criminalizing dissent : a new law makes it potentially a crime to donate to left-wing organizations , human-rights laws have been weakened , and even investigative reporting has become more dangerous , owing to stricter libel penalties . 
Ha &apos;aretz calls the push &quot; the new feudalism . &quot; 
Finally , in America , the National Defense Authorization Act , enacted by Congress in December , allows the president to suspend due process for US citizens , detain them indefinitely , and render them for torture . 
One should not be surprised to see similar legislation adopted in democracies worldwide . 
Not only are laws criminalizing previously legal dissent , organizing , and reporting being replicated in advanced democracies ; so are violent tactics against protesters , backed by the increasing push in countries with long traditions of civil policing to militarize law enforcement . 
Indeed , increasingly sophisticated weapons systems and protective equipment are being disseminated to civilian police officers . 
In the US , the federal government has spent an estimated $ 34 billion since the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks to arm state and local police forces with battlefield-grade hardware . 
Investigative reporting has also revealed cross-pollination of anti-protest training : local police from cities like Austin , Texas , have been sent to Israel for training in crowd control and other tactics . 
The globalization of mercenaries to crack down on dissent is also proceeding apace . 
Mercenaries are important in a time of global grassroots protest , because it is easier to turn a foreigner &apos;s guns or batons against strangers than it is to turn the military or police against fellow citizens . 
Erik Prince , the head of the most infamous outfit , Academi ( formerly Xe Services , formerly Blackwater ) , has relocated to the UAE , while Pakistani mercenaries have been recruited in large numbers to Bahrain , where protesters have been met with increasingly violent repression . 
But this apparently coordinated pushback against global protest movements is not yet triumphant - not even in China , as the people of Wukan have shown . 
While the outcome of the villagers &quot; protest against the local government &apos;s confiscation of their land remains uncertain , the standoff reveals new power at the grassroots level : social media allows sharper , coordinated gatherings and the rapid dissemination of news unfiltered by official media . 
The Internet is also disseminating templates of what real democracy looks like - instantly and worldwide . 
Not surprisingly , people use this technology in ways that indicate that they have little interest in being cordoned off into conflicting and competing ethnicities , nationalities , or religious identities . 
Overwhelmingly , they want simple democracy and economic self-determination . 
That agenda is in direct conflict with the interests of global capital and governments that have grown accustomed to operating without citizen oversight . 
It is a conflict that can be expected to heighten dramatically in 2012 , as protesters &quot; agendas - from Occupy Wall Street to Occupy Moscow - gain further coherence . 
Much is at stake . 
Depending on the outcome , the world will come to look either more like China - open for business , but closed for dissent - or more like Denmark .
