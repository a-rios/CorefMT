The Euro at Mid-Crisis 
CAMBRIDGE - Now that the European Union and the International Monetary Fund have committed â‚¬ 67.5 billion to rescue Ireland &apos;s troubled banks , is the eurozone &apos;s debt crisis finally nearing a conclusion ? 
Unfortunately , no . 
In fact , we are probably only at the mid-point of the crisis . 
To be sure , a huge , sustained burst of growth could still cure all of Europe &apos;s debt problems - as it would anyone &apos;s . 
But that halcyon scenario looks increasingly improbable . 
The endgame is far more likely to entail a wave of debt write-downs , similar to the one that finally wound up the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980 &quot; s . 
For starters , there are more bailouts to come , with Portugal at the top of the list . 
With an average growth rate of less than 1 % over the past decade , and arguably the most sclerotic labor market in Europe , it is hard to see how Portugal can grow out of its massive debt burden . 
This burden includes both public debt ( owed by the government ) and external dent ( owed by the country as a whole to foreigners ) . 
The Portuguese rightly argue that their situation is not as dire as that of Greece , which is already in the economic equivalent of intensive care . 
But Portugal &apos;s debt levels are still highly problematic by historical benchmarks ( based on my research with Carmen Reinhart ) . 
With a baseline scenario of recession or sluggish growth amid budget austerity for years ahead , Portugal will likely seek help sooner rather than later . 
Spain is a more difficult case . 
The central government is arguably solvent , but a significant chunk of municipal and provincial bank debt seems underwater . 
The big question in Spain is whether , as in Ireland , the central government will allow itself to be gamed into taking on private ( and also municipal ) debt . 
Here again , history gives no cause for optimism . 
It is very difficult for a central government to sit on the sidelines when the economy &apos;s key players are on the brink of collapse . 
But bailouts for Portugal and Spain are only the next - and not necessarily final - phase of the crisis . 
Ultimately , a significant restructuring of private and / or public debt is likely to be needed in all of the debt-distressed eurozone countries . 
After all , bailouts from the EU and the IMF are only a temporizing measure : even sweetheart loans , after all , eventually must be repaid . 
Already facing sluggish growth before fiscal austerity set in , the so-called &quot; PIGS &quot; ( Portugal , Ireland , Greece , and Spain ) face the prospect of a &quot; lost decade &quot; much as Latin America experienced in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Latin America &apos;s rebirth and modern growth dynamic really only began to unfold after the 1987 &quot; Brady plan &quot; orchestrated massive debt write-downs across the region . 
Surely , a similar restructuring is the most plausible scenario in Europe as well . 
It sometimes seems that the only eurozone leader who is willing to face the likely prospect of future debt restructuring is German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
The Germans have been widely castigated for pointing out that Europe has no clear mechanism for sorting out sovereign ( government ) defaults , and that surely it needs one . 
Many pundits would have one believe that Ireland would have pulled through unscathed absent Germany &apos;s blundering statements . 
That is nonsense . 
With huge private debts , falling house prices , and external claims on Ireland amounting to more than 10 times national income ( according to the Reinhart-Rogoff database ) , there was never going to be an easy way out . 
Allowing European debt problems to fester and grow by sweeping them under the carpet through dubious theatrics can only make those problems worse . 
Indeed , only last July the eurozone made a big show of its financial &quot; stress tests &quot; of its banks , giving almost all of them , including in Ireland , a clean bill of health . 
Denial is a not a useful policy for dealing with a financial crisis . 
Europe &apos;s debt problems should , in fact , still be quite manageable - provided the requisite write-downs and debt restructurings are implemented . 
Here is where the latest Irish bailout is particularly disconcerting . 
What Europe and the IMF have essentially done is to convert a private-debt problem into a sovereign-debt problem . 
Private bondholders , people and entities who lent money to banks , are being allowed to pull out their money en masse and have it replaced by public debt . 
Have the Europeans decided that sovereign default is easier , or are they just dreaming that it won &apos;t happen ? 
By nationalizing private debts , Europe is following the path of the 1980 &quot; s debt crisis in Latin America . 
There , too , governments widely &quot; guaranteed &quot; private-sector debt , and then proceeded to default on it . 
Finally , under the 1987 Brady plan , debts were written down by roughly 30 % , four years after the crisis hit full throttle . 
Most post-mortems of the Latin American crisis suggest that all parties would have been far better served had they been able to agree on partial debt forgiveness much earlier . 
Latin America might have returned to growth far sooner than it did . 
Creditors might even have received more in the end . 
As European policymakers seek to move from one stage of denial to another , perhaps it is time to start looking ahead more realistically . 
As any recovering alcoholic could tell them , the first step is admitting , with Merkel , that Europe has a problem .
