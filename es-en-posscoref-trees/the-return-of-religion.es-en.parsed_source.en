The Return of Religion ? 
BUDAPEST - It &apos;s a well-worn contrast : the United States is religious , Europe is secular . 
Yet , in some respects , this clichéd opposition has actually been reversed recently : religion played virtually no role during the last American presidential elections , while in a range of different European countries major controversies about religion have flared up , suggesting that questions of faith are back at the center of European politics . 
Consider French President Nicolas Sarkozy . 
On numerous occasions , he has argued that his country needs to rethink its traditional strict separation of state and religion , called laïcité . 
In particular , according to the twice-divorced self-confessed &quot; cultural Catholic , &quot; France should develop a &quot; positive secularism . &quot; 
In contrast to negative laïcité , which according to Sarkozy &quot; excludes and denounces , &quot; laïcité positive invites &quot; dialogue &quot; and recognizes the social benefits of religion . 
In a much criticized speech in Rome at the end of 2007 , Sarkozy acknowledged the Christian roots of France , &quot; the eldest daughter of the Church &quot; ; he also praised Islam during a visit to Saudi Arabia . 
Now he wants state subsidies for faith-based organizations - a policy proposal that upsets his many secularist critics . 
This new appeal to religion - after a long period when it was taken for granted that secularization would make religion less and less politically relevant - is not an exclusively French phenomenon . 
The Spanish People &apos;s Party tried hard to mobilize Catholics during the election campaign in March 2008 . 
The church supported the PP against a prime minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , whose advocacy of gay marriage , more relaxed divorce laws , and the removal of compulsory religion classes from the national curriculum upset many religious conservatives . 
Zapatero eventually felt it necessary to tell a Vatican envoy that Spanish bishops should stop meddling in the elections ( which he won ) . 
In Italy , Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi precipitated a constitutional crisis by trying to rush through emergency legislation to prevent a comatose patient from being taken off life support . 
This reminded many observers of what the America &apos;s Republican Party tried to do in order to demonstrate its &quot; pro-life commitments &quot; during George W. Bush &apos;s presidency . 
Finally , there is Britain , usually seen as perhaps the most secular country in Western Europe , and thus the least likely candidate to see the return of religion of any kind ( outside its Muslim community ) . 
Under David Cameron &apos;s leadership , the newly invigorated Conservative Party is listening to a number of thinkers , dubbed &quot; red Tories , &quot; who urge the party to turn its back on Thatcherism and embrace civil society , local community , the family , and , not least , religion as a major force in fostering responsible social behavior . 
In short , there is a pattern here . 
But the point is not that individuals in different European countries are becoming more religious - there is hardly any evidence for that . 
Globally , there might be good reasons to talk about what sociologists describe as the rise of &quot; post-secular societies , &quot; but Europe remains the exception . 
What really explains these new public controversies surrounding religion is something else , something political : the dilemma in which right-wing and center-right European parties find themselves . 
Many of these parties used to advocate market radicalism , or at least strong doses of economic liberalization . 
Not just since the financial crisis have they retreated from these positions and tried to fashion a gentler , more socially conscious image . 
Yet , in the search for what Cameron has called a new &quot; look , feel , and identity , &quot; these parties have been treading a fine line : on the one hand , they have attempted to appear more modern - for example , by appointing an increasing number of women and members of ethnic minorities to cabinet posts . 
On the other hand , they have painted themselves as sworn enemies of the left &apos;s supposed moral relativism - an image for which the recourse to religion is obviously helpful . 
In fact , some intellectuals close to the right have long advocated an opening towards Europe &apos;s Muslim immigrants and their descendants . 
Where they can vote , so the argument goes , Muslim traditionalists would rather vote for a conservative party , even if it has Catholic roots , than for a secular left-wing party perceived as advocating loose morals . 
This is not to say that all appeals to religion are just cynical election ploys . 
Especially in the face of the financial crisis , religion has been presented as a source for what Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have called the project of &quot; moralizing capitalism . &quot; 
That is not an absurd idea . 
There is a long and distinguished tradition of Catholic social thought . 
But taking these traditions seriously would require much larger transformations of capitalism than even avowed Christian Democrats are prepared to contemplate , including a much wider distribution of ownership and mechanisms for involving workers in management . 
Theories of &quot; red Toryism &quot; might go some way in this direction , but it remains to be seen whether they will ever translate into practice . 
For the moment , the temptation is for the European right to find its &quot; new look &quot; through a selective appeal to religion - and wait and see whether it works as an electoral strategy . They should remember , though , that starting a Kulturkampf is to play with fire : it might be possible to instrumentalize religious passions for a time ; but such passions cannot permanently be controlled from above .
