North Korea &apos;s Choice 
NEW YORK - When the Republic of Korea was established in 1948 , Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world . 
GDP per capita was US $ 67 in 1953 , immediately following the Korean War , and rose to only US $ 79 in 1960 . 
At that time , North Korea &apos;s economy was much stronger than that of the South . 
Natural resources were abundant in the North , and even electricity was supplied from North to South . 
Most industry was located in the North , whereas the South was mainly agricultural . 
Today , the South &apos;s GDP is 40 times larger than that of the North . 
Comparing the two Korean economies is virtually meaningless . 
Such disparities do not arise from different historical experiences , because Koreans have shared a history for thousands of years as one nation . 
The gap , instead , reflects recent historical choices . 
By persistently adhering to a planned economy and obsolete ideology , North Korea is trapped in a vicious cycle , suffering from unstable food supplies and low , or sometimes negative , economic growth . 
Nonetheless , North Korea has shown little interest in reform . 
Instead , it has developed a nuclear weapons program that threatens stability in the region and places a heavy burden on its economy . 
South Korea , which is enjoying unprecedented prosperity , is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with North Koreans &quot; economic despair . 
Probably no two neighboring countries have such a huge economic gap , let alone countries that share the same ethnic and historical background . 
The danger is that such a discrepancy can become a source of instability and conflict . 
To overcome its economic deficiencies and attain social stability , the North has no choice but to abandon its nuclear weapons program and move toward reform and greater openness . 
South Korea is trying to persuade the North to make this strategic decision . 
We are more than willing to help the North achieve economic growth , which is almost always the source of peace and security . 
As such , North Korea &apos;s economic recovery is vital for an enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula . 
So , in accordance with the Six-Party Talks ( North and South Korea , the United States , Russia , China , and Japan ) my government wants to create a Korean Economic Community in collaboration with the North . 
In cooperation with the international community , we will help North Korea raise its annual per capita income to US $ 3,000 . 
To this end , we will carry out joint projects in five key areas : education , finance , industrial infrastructure , quality of life , and economic development . 
But an institutional mechanism is needed to implement this initiative , such as an inter-Korean consultative body . 
Of course , mere economic assistance or investment is not sufficient for a country to bail itself out of the vicious circle of underdevelopment and poverty . 
A national economy can take off only when the necessary infrastructure , an adequate level of competition , and reasonable government policies are in place . 
We know how difficult it is to achieve such conditions , because we had to do it ourselves . 
Our vision for an inter-Korean economic community is based on sharing our experiences with the North . 
True , inter-Korean relations have already expanded . 
But this expansion has not brought fundamental change to the two Koreas &quot; relationship . 
An incident at Mt . 
A middle-aged South Korean female tourist was shot to death while walking on the beach , having inadvertently crossed over the boundary of the tourist zone . 
No North-South dialogue has emerged to investigate the incident , or to prevent a recurrence . 
Under these circumstances , there are greater calls in South Korea for a new approach towards the North . 
We now believe that inter-Korean relations should conform to principles and standards that any member of the international community should respect . 
Another key consideration is to consolidate a sustainable peace structure on the Korean Peninsula . 
This cannot merely be a state of affairs like the current one , in which hostilities are absent . 
It refers to an enduring peace , which is not easily affected by incidents or accidents and is able to prevent politico-military crises such as that caused by the North &apos;s nuclear program . 
The only way to realize such a peace is by completing North Korea &apos;s denuclearization and establishing a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula . 
As of today , the Six-Party Talks is the principal framework to open up the future of the North . 
If the North abandons its nuclear weapons program , many benefits can be gained . 
Relations between the North and its neighbors can improve , along with a greater probability of forming a Northeast Asia peace and security mechanism . 
Fortunately , America &apos;s removal of North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism has re-started the denuclearization process . 
But the North &apos;s prior threat to resume work at the facilities suggests that this process may be fitful . 
Moreover , since South Korea &apos;s new government took office earlier this year little progress has been made in relations between the two Koreas . 
But our vision will eventually open up ways to solve North Korea &apos;s problems , not only bringing a better future for the North , but also making the Korean Peninsula a gateway for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia . 
Leaders in the North may mistakenly believe that they can circumvent or outmaneuver the South - the so-called strategy of driving a wedge between the Republic of Korea and the US . 
But in the end , South Korea is the neighbor whom the North can truly trust and rely on the most . 
The North should realize this and make a wise choice .
