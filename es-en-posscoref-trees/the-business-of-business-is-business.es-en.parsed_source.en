The Business of Business is Business 
The American President Calvin Coolidge once said that the business of America is business . 
He might have added that the business of business everywhere is to pursue profits , for lately some corporate leaders seem to have lost sight of that elementary precept . 
Daniel Vasella , the chairman and CEO of Switzerland-based Novartis , the world &apos;s fifth largest pharmaceutical company , recently wrote that multinational companies &quot; have a duty to adhere to fundamental values and to support and promote them . &quot; 
If he were referring to corporate values such as honesty , innovation , voluntary exchange , and the wisdom of the marketplace , he would be right . 
But what he meant was &quot; collaborat &#91; ing &#93; 
The extension of human rights is a worthy goal , to be sure , but Vasella &apos;s saccharine altruism brings to mind economist Milton Friedman &apos;s reproachful observation that &quot; businessmen believe that they are defending free enterprise when they declaim that business is not concerned &apos; merely &apos; with profit but also with promoting desirable &apos; social &apos; ends ; that business has a &apos; social conscience &apos; and takes seriously its responsibilities for 
Friedman accused such executives of being &quot; unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society . &quot; 
Vasella &apos;s current catchwords are &quot; human rights &quot; and &quot; corporate citizenship , &quot; but we have recently seen other similar examples of businesses trying to &quot; do good &quot; ( or perhaps just trying to look good ) while deviating from their primary purpose . 
These include McDonald &apos;s ending its popular &quot; supersized &quot; portions in the name of discouraging obesity , and businesses adopting less efficient , more &quot; sustainable &quot; practices . 
Businesses do not have social responsibilities ; only people do . 
Inasmuch as corporate leaders work for the owners of the business , their responsibility is to pursue the best interests of their employers - interests that relate primarily to making as much money as possible while conforming to the legal rules and ethical norms of society . 
By taking actions on behalf of the company that he arbitrarily decides are &quot; socially responsible , &quot; a corporate executive is , in effect , spending someone else &apos;s money by reducing returns to shareholders . 
One of the easiest things to do is to spend other people &apos;s money on causes in which you believe ; one of the most difficult , but most meaningful , is to spend your own money . 
If these executives donated even 5 % of their salaries to such causes , they would be worthy of admiration , even if the causes were repugnant to some of us . 
The weakness of Vasella &apos;s position is further shown by his injunction that businesses should collaborate with the UN . 
This is the same UN whose officials took kickbacks from the Iraqi oil for food program and jetted around the world on Concorde while supposedly trying to ameliorate poverty , and whose Commission on Human Rights was until recently chaired by Libya and now includes five of the world &apos;s fifteen most repressive nations - China , Cuba , Eritrea , Saudi Arabia , and Sudan . 
Increasingly , the highly political , woefully inefficient , self-serving , and often corrupt UN sees itself not only as the world &apos;s peacekeeper but also as the arbiter of international health , environmental , and human rights issues . 
Neither free enterprise nor the human condition is likely to benefit if companies decide to follow Vasella &apos;s model . 
Their actions would , however , raise the cost of doing business , lower corporate productivity and feed the UN &apos;s predilections for meddling . 
By diverting resources away from productive uses , businesses would end up hurting many of the very people they claim to want to help .
