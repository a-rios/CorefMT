The New Loose Nukes 
LOS ANGELES - Nobody would dispute the danger inherent in possessing nuclear assets . 
But that danger becomes far more acute in a combat zone , where nuclear materials and weapons are at risk of theft , and reactors can become bombing targets . 
These risks - most apparent in today &apos;s chaos-ridden Middle East - raise troubling questions about the security of nuclear assets in volatile countries everywhere . 
Two recent events demonstrate what is at stake . 
On July 9 , the militant group now known as the Islamic State captured 40 kilograms ( 88 pounds ) of uranium compounds at Mosul University in Iraq . 
The captured uranium was not weapons-grade ; international inspectors removed all sensitive material from Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War ( which is why it was absent when the United States invaded in 2003 ) . 
But what international response , if any , would have been initiated if the cache had been highly enriched ? 
On the same day , Hamas launched three powerful Iranian-designed rockets from Gaza at Israel &apos;s Dimona reactor . 
Luckily , two missed the target , and Israel managed to intercept the third . 
But the episode represented a serious escalation of hostilities and served as an important reminder of the vulnerability of nuclear reactors in warzones . 
In fact , Hamas made similar attempts to attack the Dimona complex in 2012 , as did Iraq in 1991 , with the aim of releasing the site &apos;s contents to inflict radiological damage on Israel &apos;s population . 
( The perpetrators appeared clueless to the fact that certain weather conditions would have concentrated the radioactive debris in the Palestinian-majority West Bank . ) 
Of course , it is possible that these events are an aberration . 
After all , the only conflict so far in which authorities have lost control of sensitive nuclear materials was the Georgia-Abkhazia War in the 1990s , when unknown forces seized a small amount of highly enriched uranium from a research institute . 
Likewise , though there have been numerous attacks on nuclear reactors under construction , the sole threat to an operating plant in a combat zone outside of Israel occurred at the start of the fighting in ex-Yugoslavia , when Serbian nationalists considered attacking Slovenia &apos;s Kr≈°ko power plant and sent warplanes over the site . 
The plant &apos;s operators temporarily halted electricity generation to curb the risk of a radiation release , but nothing came of the threat . 
Indeed , whenever nuclear assets have been least secure - during the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse , China &apos;s Cultural Revolution , and the Algiers putsch ( when a group of mutinous retired generals set their sights on a nuclear device that France was testing in the Algerian desert ) - they have not been compromised . 
Even in Ukraine today , despite the escalating civil conflict , the country &apos;s 15 nuclear power plants have remained untouched ( though even with new defensive measures taken by Ukrainian officials , this could easily change ) . 
It is impossible to know whether this benign pattern will hold . 
But recent developments in the Middle East suggest that there are grounds for concern in other volatile countries , namely Pakistan , North Korea , and Iran . 
Pakistan has a large nuclear weapons program and faces an expansive jihadi insurgency , which previously attacked military bases suspected of housing nuclear assets . 
Though Pakistan has not experienced a nuclear breach , and the government insists that safeguards remain robust , the country &apos;s increasingly frequent and severe bouts of instability raise serious questions about the future . 
While North Korea &apos;s nuclear arsenal is much smaller , persistent doubts about the regime &apos;s sustainability make it a matter of grave concern . 
In the event of the regime &apos;s collapse - a distinct possibility - it would be difficult to prevent the diversion of its assets , or even the use of its weapons . 
For its part , Iran seems relatively stable , at least compared to its neighbors . 
But it faces an uncertain political future . 
If a power struggle emerges , the large Bushehr reactor could be used as a bargaining chip . 
To mitigate such risks , the international community could maintain its traditional policy of sitting tight and hoping that governments retain control of their nuclear infrastructure . 
But the United States , for one , is no longer satisfied with this approach . 
According to media reports , it has devised a strategy for deploying Special Forces to neutralize Pakistan &apos;s nuclear arsenal in the event that its authorities lose control . 
And some government-connected think tanks have explored the possibility of deploying US combat forces to address nuclear risks in North Korea if the regime crumbles . 
Such plans , however , are by no means foolproof - not least owing to the difficulties of finding concealed nuclear assets and safeguarding reactors . 
Moreover , the American public &apos;s willingness to become enmeshed in yet another risky military venture , when boosting homeland security could suffice , is dubious , at best . 
Instead of waiting for a major development to force hurried action , the world &apos;s major powers should engage in a full-throated debate to determine the best approach to address nuclear risks in volatile countries , seeking ways to cooperate whenever necessary . 
After all , even rival powers like China and the US or India and Pakistan share an interest in preventing the world &apos;s most dangerous weapons from falling under the control of its most fanatical minds .
