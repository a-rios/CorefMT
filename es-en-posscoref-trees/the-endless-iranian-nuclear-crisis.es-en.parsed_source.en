The Endless Iranian Nuclear Crisis 
Iran will continue to enrich uranium regardless of whether a Republican or a Democrat is America &apos;s president . 
At the same time , the United States will oppose any Iranian nuclear program - even a civilian program - because this will contribute to the stability of the regime in Tehran . 
As a result , nuclear tensions are likely to bedevil US-Iranian relations for years to come . 
Iran , it is often claimed , has no need for nuclear power , given its abundant oil and natural gas reserves . 
But the Iranian government is under economic and political pressure to supply increasing amounts of electricity to its growing population and fragile economy . 
Using oil or natural gas for domestic electricity threatens oil and gas exports , which are the principle source of government revenues . 
Indeed , with domestic oil consumption growing at a higher rate than production , government revenues from oil exports are already in decline . 
Thus , nuclear power will halt the decline in government revenues by freeing more oil and natural gas for export . 
Iran &apos;s natural gas resources , if developed , would not be a substitute for cheap nuclear power , because gas is more profitable in other uses than in power generation . 
The Iranian government fears that electricity shortages , slow economic growth , and high unemployment will turn the populace against it . 
As social tensions increase , political turmoil will follow . 
Nuclear power offers the possibility of cheap , plentiful electricity , which will contribute to social and political stability . 
Iranian experts argue that , in considering the trade-off between internal unrest and external sanctions , the Iranian government must choose between domestic security and international security . 
Domestic pressure could very well bring down the regime , but international pressure will not . 
History is on the side of the Iranian government . 
The Islamic Revolution has survived a brutal war with Iraq , economic sanctions , and decades of international pressure and isolation from the US . 
Moreover , Iran &apos;s leaders remember that the Shah was forced to flee the country in 1979 , despite having strong international support . 
While there may be security reasons for any future US administration to oppose even a civilian nuclear program , American policymakers also recognize the strategic impact that nuclear energy will have in stabilizing the Iranian regime . 
The US and Iran have been fighting proxy wars since 1979 , and their ongoing conflict means that proxy wars will continue in Lebanon , Iraq , Afghanistan , and the Caspian Sea region , as will trade and investment wars . 
Indeed , as long as China and Russia have money to invest and arms to sell , most UN sanctions will be toothless . 
Iran will continue to threaten the world community that it will use its oil weapon , but this is highly unlikely . 
It is not in Iran &apos;s interest , under any scenario , to decrease oil exports , let alone halt them . 
However , domestic pressure , a sense of nationalism , and the need to improve its bargaining position with Western countries might force the Iranian government to respond to harsh UN sanctions or an air attack on its nuclear facilities . 
But even under these extreme circumstances , Iran will still need its oil revenue . 
A symbolic cut or embargo , while possible , would have little impact on world oil markets . 
Iran &apos;s government has more effective options to respond to attacks from the US and its allies . 
Its supporters in Iraq might cripple Iraqi oil exports from Basra , which would damage US plans in Iraq while boosting Iran &apos;s oil revenues , or limit the availability of fuel to the US Army by attacking roads and bridges , especially the Kuwait City-Baghdad highway . 
The world community will continue to pay a high price for the nuclear standoff , which will cast a shadow over world oil markets for years to come . 
Some experts argue that it has already raised oil prices by about $ 15 per barrel . 
Ironically , an Iranian civilian nuclear program would enhance US and world energy security by making more oil and gas available in the global market . 
But America &apos;s determination to destabilize Iran and the Iranian government &apos;s determination to retain power reduce the likelihood of this scenario .
