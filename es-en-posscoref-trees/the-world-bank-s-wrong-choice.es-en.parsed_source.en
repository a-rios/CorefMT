The World Bank &apos;s Wrong Choice 
NEW YORK - The selection of the American nominee Jim Yong Kim as President of the World Bank , over Nigeria &apos;s finance minister , Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala , who was overwhelmingly regarded as a vastly superior candidate , is impossible to condone but easy to explain . 
It also points to serious dangers for the unfinished task of development . 
The selection process suffered from several inequities and non-transparent features that undermined the United States &quot; claim to the contrary . 
Indeed , those claims were of a piece with the linguistic obfuscations that dominate American public debate : just as carpet bombing was called &quot; pacification &quot; during the Vietnam War , today illegal immigrants are called &quot; undocumented aliens . &quot; 
Thus , the rollout of the American propaganda machine for Kim , who traveled to many capitals worldwide with US Treasury support and promises of American largesse , surely biased the vote against Okonjo-Iweala . 
And , after all , the World Bank is a donor institution . 
Her human capital was no match for his financial capital . 
In a genuinely open , merit-based contest , the 25-member Executive Board &apos;s deliberations should have been preceded by debates between the candidates . 
I suspect that Okonjo-Iweala , with her enormous competence and renowned wit , would have gotten the better of Kim . 
The world would also have seen why so many of us were rooting for her . 
Again , the worldwide influence of the powerful liberal media in the US should not be underestimated . 
This is an election year in the US : if President Barack Obama had nominated a lamppost , America &apos;s &quot; newspaper of record &quot; would have found it to be possessed of excellent credentials . 
Moreover , just as Ralph Nader &apos;s candidacy ( and the US Supreme Court ) prevented Al Gore from defeating George W. Bush in 2000 , one must recognize that Okonjo-Iweala was undercut by the candidacy of Jos√© Antonio Ocampo , a former finance minister of Colombia , who was backed by Brazil . 
Brazil should have worked with India , Mexico , and South Africa instead , to produce unified support for Okonjo-Iweala . 
When Brazil did move in that direction , it was too late to make any difference . 
And now one cannot suppress the thought that Kim &apos;s election could turn into a disaster for the cause of development . 
His tirade in 2000 against the liberal reforms that have transformed countries like India and China into global growth engines , reduced poverty , and benefited marginalized groups shows that he lacked good judgment on fundamental issues . 
No one recalls any expression of regret by him , which suggests that he persists in such folly - and would use conditionality to turn the clock back on decades of progress in development economics . 
But my fear is that Kim would be a disaster even on health-care issues - an area where he has rightly earned credit for his work on AIDS , malaria , and tuberculosis . 
Thanks to the economic growth that resulted from the reforms that he denounced , countries like India and Brazil now have higher revenues to spend on health care for the poor , among other public goods . 
As a result , the public-health questions that Kim will face at the World Bank are very different from the &quot; big &quot; diseases with which he dealt in the past . 
India , for example , is struggling with the balance between public and private provisions of medical care for routine health problems , and with questions of medical training and availability ( that is , should India have &quot; barefoot doctors , &quot; or aim for only fully qualified practitioners ? ) . 
Can Kim lead on these and other issues that are beyond his experience ? 
Foreboding is in order .
