Emerging Economies &quot; Misinsurance Problem 
LONDON - Over the last decade , America &apos;s expansionary monetary policy and China &apos;s rapid growth have been the two key drivers of global financial flows . 
Now , both dynamics are being reversed , generating new risks for the global economy - particularly for emerging countries . 
Whether they can cope with these changes will depend on whether they have taken out enough insurance against the right risks . 
Following the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990 &quot; s , emerging economies began to accumulate massive foreign-exchange reserves to protect themselves against the risks of external over-indebtedness . 
In fact , they amassed far more than they needed - $ 6.5 trillion , at last count - effectively becoming over-insured against external balance-of-payments shocks . 
But they remained underinsured against domestic credit risks ­ - the leading threat to emerging economies today . 
After the global financial crisis erupted in 2008 , interest rates plummeted , fueling private-sector credit booms in many of the largest emerging markets , including Brazil , India , Indonesia , and Turkey . 
Although these booms were initially financed by domestic capital , they soon became dependent on foreign capital , which flowed into their economies as advanced-country central banks pumped huge amounts of liquidity into financial markets . 
Now , just as the US Federal Reserve contemplates an exit from its unconventional monetary policies , emerging economies &quot; current-account positions are weakening , making their reliance on capital inflows increasingly apparent - and increasingly dangerous . 
Ironically , today &apos;s pain stems from one of the great successes that emerging economies have achieved : the reduction of foreign-currency funding in favor of local-currency debt . 
As emerging-market central banks leaned against heavy capital inflows in order to mitigate exchange-rate appreciation , their currencies became less volatile . 
The resulting perception that currency risk was declining bolstered capital inflows further . 
This virtuous feedback loop has now turned vicious , with capital inflows amounting to only a fraction of outflows . 
Given this , the likely upshot of monetary tightening in the advanced economies will be a long depreciation of emerging-market currencies and , in turn , a significant interest-rate hike - a trend that puts emerging economies at risk for the kinds of credit crises that have bedeviled developed economies over the last six years . 
The higher interest rates rise to stabilize emerging markets &quot; currencies , the more severe their crises will be . 
Ultimately , even if emerging economies manage to diversify their funding away from foreign currencies , they will remain hostages to US monetary-policy cycles . 
Had emerging economies resisted the temptation of excessive private-sector credit growth , raising interest rates in order to stabilize currencies would not pose a severe threat to economic performance . 
But , unsurprisingly , they did not ; rather , they succumbed to the notion that unprecedentedly high rates of GDP growth were the new normal . 
Nowhere was this more apparent than in China , where double-digit annual output gains long obscured the flaws in a state-led , credit-fueled growth model that favors state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) and selected industries , like the real-estate sector , to the detriment of private savers . 
Since 2008 , banking-sector credit growth in China has been among the fastest in the world , far outpacing GDP growth , and China &apos;s total debt has risen from 130 % of GDP to 220 % of GDP . 
As of this year , ¥ 1 of GDP growth is consistent with more than ¥ 3.5 of credit growth . 
China &apos;s financial sector is now increasingly feeling the strain of this rapid credit growth , which has led to overcapacity in favored sectors and mounting debt problems for local governments , SOEs , and banks . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s shadow-banking system has expanded at an unprecedented rate . 
But here , too , mounting risks have been largely ignored , owing partly to the collateralization of real property , which is believed to retain its value permanently , and partly to the system of implicit government guarantees that backs loans to local governments and SOEs . 
At the very least , the combination of higher interest rates in the shadow-banking sector and weaker nominal GDP growth undermines borrowers &quot; debt-repayment capacity . 
In a worst-case scenario , falling property prices or diminishing faith in implicit government guarantees would compound the risks generated by the shadow-banking system , severely undermining China &apos;s financial stability . 
In that sense , although China , with its $ 3.5 trillion stock of foreign-exchange reserves , may seem to exemplify emerging economies &quot; tendency to be over-insured against external risks , it actually faces the same credit risks as its counterparts . 
The difference is that China has implemented structural - and thus longer-lasting - credit-based policies , while other emerging economies have been drawn into a cyclical lending binge . 
Indeed , China &apos;s slowness to implement an alternative to the investment-led , debt-financed growth model that has prevailed for the last two decades means that its domestic credit risks are the most significant threat to the global economy today . 
While China may have the financial resources to cover its debt overhang , it risks being left with a low-to-middle-income economy , high debt levels , and nominal growth rates roughly two-thirds lower than the 17 % average annual rate achieved in 2004-2011 . 
This is bad news for other emerging economies , which have depended heavily on China &apos;s growth for their own . 
Unless emerging-market governments take advantage of the limited space provided by their foreign-exchange reserves and floating currencies to enact vital structural reforms , the onus of adjustment will fall on interest rates , compounding the effects of slowing growth and the risks associated with bad debt . 
Whether this becomes a systemic issue affecting the entire global economy will hinge on China .
