Separatism and Russia \ u0027s Future 
MOSCOW : &quot; Self-determination &quot; dominated international politics for two centuries . 
In the postwar era , Marxists were the strongest advocates of this theory , insisting on including it in the UN charter . 
That grant of legitimacy to the national aspirations of subordinated peoples helped eliminate colonialism . 
Should the principle of &quot; self-determination , &quot; however , continue to be embraced in today &apos;s world ? 
Imagine the chaos that may ensue if separatist energies are allowed to continue in an unfettered way in a world where over two thousand ethnic groups live in over 150 distinct states . 
Nowadays , indeed , separatism is not a problem confined to individual states and societies ; it is one for the entire global community . 
Of course , if all parts of a nation accept separation , creation of a new national state need not be resisted by the world community . 
But when a party disagrees about dividing a nation , separatism becomes illegitimate . 
So the world community must resist unilateral efforts at separation because separatism today is much more dangerous than during the post-colonial era due to the twin evils of international terrorism and religious extremism . 
When I suggest that religious extremism is a danger , I do not equate it with religious fundamentalism . 
Muslims in the old Soviet Union were attracted to fundamentalism because they were oppressed . 
They could not build mosques ; they could not perform their faith in public . 
A fundamentalist adherence to Islam was a perfectly natural response to this . 
Islamic extremism differs from religious fundamentalism because , beyond promoting strict adherence to Islam , it preaches the spread of Islamic models of power and society . 
Married to terrorist tactics , religious extremists , with their unlimited goals , present a real danger to the world . 
Perhaps nowhere is this threat as serious as in Russia . 
Throughout the North Caucasus many nationalities and ethnic groups have lived in close proximity for centuries . 
Some groups - prominently Muslim Chechens - are now separatist-minded . 
Others groups want to remain part of Russia . 
In the face of such rival desires , how can Russia deal democratically with separatist claims made at gunpoint ? 
Rather than encourage more of the fragmentation that pursuit of self-determination has caused , I strongly support bringing together and uniting the nationalities that live on Russian territory into a stronger state . 
I disagree with those who argue that such a policy will hinder Russia economically and politically . 
Indeed , there are clear instances when Russia &apos;s unity with the other independent states that were once part of the Soviet Union will prove to be beneficial to everyone involved . 
Take the case of Byelorussia . 
During Soviet times , Byelorussia was an &quot; assembling room &quot; of Soviet industrial production . 
It remains a republic with solid intellectual potential and hardworking manpower . 
Byelorussia may not posses as many natural resources as Russia , but it is self-sufficient , so it may not be the long-term drain on Russia &apos;s economy that many see Byelorussia as being . 
Most importantly , Byelorussia and Russia share historical origins . 
These bind us together . 
Why should we live in two distinct states if most people , not small groups on either side , want unity ? 
In uniting with Byelorussia we need not act precipitously . 
Byelorussia &apos;s President Aleksander Lukashenka seeks closer ties to Russia . 
We agree with him . 
After all , much of Western Europe adheres to a common currency and its member countries have not come to a bad end . 
These processes are complicated but the point is to move in this direction ; then , perhaps , Ukraine will begin to come closer to Russia . 
What applies to Byelorussia in terms of ending an unwanted separatism applies even more to the Caucasus . 
In the US , many ethnic groups live at peace within America &apos;s states . 
Russia must resolve its ethnic , national , and separatist problems by providing cultural autonomy and national self-expression within the context of a community remaining part of the Russian Federation . 
Assisting national self-expression by some , however , does not mean that others , say Chechnya &apos;s neighbors in Tatarstan or Bashkortostan , should suffer . 
National support for one group should not mean oppression of others , or come at their expense . 
In seeking peaceful solutions to ethnic and separatist friction , Russia faces unique problems . 
Nationalities expelled by Stalin to internal exile in Siberia and elsewhere may want to return to areas that were theirs &quot; by origin . &quot; 
Crimean Tartars , for example , want to return home to their &quot; Crimea . &quot; 
Individuals should be able to return to their homelands , but as individuals . 
For even if we admit ( and we do admit ) that historic injustices - historic crimes , really - did take place , we must recognize that land which one people lost through expulsion has been repopulated by others . 
To evict them would be unfair and would repeat the original historic crime . 
When all of Russia &apos;s people realize that they must live together they will begin to adjust to each other . 
To insure that this realization takes place , the separatist option must be closed . 
Only in this way will it be possible to restore the peaceful relations which existed before ; only then will our many ethnic and national groups find a means to drain the violence from their antagonisms .
