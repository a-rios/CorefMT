A Plutocrats Summit ? 
BRISBANE - At an official dinner in Washington , DC , ahead of November &apos;s G-20 Summit in Brisbane , Australia-born media mogul Rupert Murdoch lectured ministers on the dangers of socialism and big government . 
A fervent opponent of Australia &apos;s carbon price , and a battle-hardened opponent of US President Barack Obama , Murdoch lauded the virtues of austerity and minimal regulation , and railed against the corrosive effects of social safety nets . 
The ministers were in Washington to attend the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , where they attempted to thrash out differences and establish common ground before the upcoming summit . 
The tone set by Murdoch , however , suggests that a consensus on sustainable , inclusive growth will be hard to achieve . 
Murdoch &apos;s comments are in keeping with views expressed by his friend , Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott , and Abbott &apos;s current administration . 
In January , for example , Abbott informed a startled Davos conference that the global financial crisis was caused not by unregulated global markets , but rather by too much governance . 
This was certainly news to the finance ministers who had spent the past few years struggling with the toxic fallout from financial-sector excess . 
Viewed in the context of such comments , one can better understand Australia &apos;s refusal to put issues of climate change and inclusive prosperity on the Brisbane agenda . 
Of course , stimulating global growth is a big enough challenge in itself , even without considering inclusiveness or environmental sustainability . 
The IMF &apos;s gloomy growth forecasts attest to that . 
And many policymakers view Australia &apos;s G-20 chairmanship as an opportunity to re-energize and refine the group &apos;s mission to boost global growth , create jobs , and raise living standards . 
G-20 finance ministers have already decided on a 2 % target for annual growth through 2018 , and are sifting through more than 900 proposals for structural reforms in order to achieve this . 
What reforms G-20 members propose in Brisbane , and how serious they will be about implementing them , remains to be seen . 
The bigger challenge , though , is hitting those growth targets in a sustainable and inclusive way . 
If structural reforms are not done right , the Brisbane Summit will come to be regarded as a failure . 
Structural reforms , in which certain interests are sacrificed for the greater good , will always be controversial and difficult to execute . 
But when such reforms involve sacrifices by ordinary citizens and benefit society &apos;s most privileged groups , political gridlock and instability invariably follow . 
Over the past two years , academics , regulators , economists , and financial institutions have all linked the secular stagnation in demand with greater income inequality . 
It is ironic that , at a time when many in the developing world are entering , or aspire to enter , the emerging middle class , wealth in much of the developed world is becoming more concentrated at the top . 
Indeed , inequality of outcomes both in emerging and advanced economies has increased within and across generations . 
Australia &apos;s refusal to discuss inclusive growth in Brisbane may please plutocrats like Murdoch , but talk of unregulated markets , lower taxes , and the removal of social safety nets strongly indicates that the summit will offer no substantive policies aimed at reducing inequality . 
With just days to go until the Brisbane meeting , the G-20 is ignoring the main long-term threats to the global economy . 
As the Bank of England &apos;s Governor Mark Carney ( who I assume also heard Murdoch &apos;s lecture ) remarked earlier this year , &quot; &#91; U &#93; nchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself . &quot; 
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde recently put it more starkly , noting that the world &apos;s 85 richest people control more wealth than the world &apos;s 3.5 billion poorest people , and that this degree of inequality is casting a dark shadow over the global economy . 
Inequality is not a fringe issue . 
Combating its rise is essential to achieving sustainable economic growth and political stability . 
The G-20 &quot; s real power is to highlight such challenges and generate informed debate on the issues as a prelude to action . 
The question now is which leader in Brisbane , if any , will grab the global megaphone and speak out .
