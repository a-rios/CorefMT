Is &quot; Eurabia &quot; Inevitable ? 
What is it that makes young Muslims in the West susceptible to radicalism ? 
What is it about the experience of the West &apos;s rising generation of Muslims that leads a small minority to see violence as a solution to their economic and political dilemmas , and suicide as their reward and salvation ? 
Britain , which will soon mark the anniversary of last year &apos;s bombings in London , provides a test case for seeking answers to these questions . 
For young British Muslims , our globalized world challenges key beliefs , destabilizing their identity and thus encouraging a defensive response . 
British citizenship , of course , guarantees freedom of expression and minority rights , and young Muslims take full advantage of this . 
Yet they are using this freedom to deepen family and cultural ties to the closed world of their inherited Muslim identity , particularly its politics . 
In practice , this means that many young Muslims are utterly preoccupied with events in the Arab and Muslim world . 
They see what we see : a region where autocratic countries seem corrupt and paralyzed . 
But they also see an unprecedented level of hostility from the West , with regime after regime seeming to be either in peril or facing chaos . 
Afghanistan , Iraq , Palestine , and now Iran : all seem to be under attack as part of the &quot; global war on terror . &quot; 
As a result , the West &apos;s strategic choices appear inherently anti-Islamic to countless of its young Muslims . 
This preoccupation with the Middle East is at the heart of young Muslims &quot; politics in British universities , mosques , and websites . 
Although most do not support Pakistan &apos;s Pervez Musharraf , Egypt &apos;s Hosni Mubarak , or the al-Saud family , they see hypocrisy in Western criticism of these leaders that is designed to manipulate and marginalize - after all , the West does not really want to push these regimes too far . 
Access to the Internet , satellite television , and travel is drawing these young Muslims into a community that shares their vision and their rage . 
So technology is heightening the tensions that exist between the mechanics of a modern free society and the sense of a vast conspiracy against Muslims . 
This has led to a schism between the hopes young Muslims have for successful lives in the West and their aspirations for their Muslim brothers and sisters , who have suffered so many terrible disappointments . 
As young Muslims in Britain ( and across the West ) try to maneuver between the various , and often conflicting , aspects of their identity , three clear tendencies have emerged . 
A secular and pragmatic response , which makes Islam a private matter ; 
A conservative stance that reconciles cultural , religious , and familial ties with &quot; Britishness &quot; ; 
A radical response to the perceived collision between the foreign policies of their new homelands and the welfare of the Islamic world . 
Messianic waves from the Middle East , reaching both schools and mosques , help draw young Muslims into radicalism . 
One such wave is created by the hardline Saudi / Wahhabi education system , which is based on the concept of al-wala &quot; wa al bara &quot; , loyalty to the system and hostility to the infidels . 
This curriculum , exported Westward by fat Saudi subsidies , is heavily punctuated with denunciations of the infidels and calls to jihad . 
Designed to secure the legitimacy of the Saudi monarchy at home , it is indoctrinating young Western Muslims with values antithetical to open and free societies . 
Britain &apos;s government is beginning to recognize the danger , and is trying to clamp down on schools and mosques that spread hate . 
Unfortunately , such repression has been merely reactive and shortsighted , with no clear long-term vision about the nature of Islamic education in the West . 
Thus , it merely feeds young Muslims &quot; fears that they are being singled out for persecution . 
One difficulty with the British government &apos;s response is that it classifies all Muslims as just that : Muslim . 
By defining people on the basis of their religion , nuances - of national identity or of the degree of orthodoxy - are lost . 
This plays into the hands of radicals , because it makes Islam the central element of identity . 
This process , indeed , is echoed in the 22 Arab countries , where religious orthodoxy rules out any significant liberal political opposition . 
In such circumstances , the Mosque becomes the sole public space in which people can voice political views . 
Politicization of the mosque has , sadly , also become the norm in Britain . 
Islamic radicalization and terror need not continue to flourish in the West . 
Regardless of their disappointments with the Western countries &quot; foreign policy , young Muslims have been exposed to their undeniable democratic spirit . 
They may now seek a deeper connection to their Muslim identity , but , having learned to question authority , they are unlikely to accept rigid parental or Islamic traditions . 
Like other young people around them , they want to be the agents of their own destiny . 
This desire is changing Islam , especially in the West . 
The basic texts remain the same , but their interpretation , and the application of religion in people &apos;s lives , has not . 
Young Muslims , particularly in the West , are setting an example that is slowly being echoed in the Middle East , despite massive state repression . 
The task for Western policymakers is to recognize the interconnection of foreign and domestic policies . 
They must become serious about backing legitimate democratic representation in Muslim countries , for only then will Western policy seem less hypocritical . 
They must also ensure that career choices are as open to their Muslim citizens as they are to everyone else . 
In short , young Muslims in the West need to believe that democratic principles are respected abroad and applied equally at home . 
Only when such a belief becomes general will despair stop fueling terrorism , and suicide bombing come to be viewed as an obscene calling .
