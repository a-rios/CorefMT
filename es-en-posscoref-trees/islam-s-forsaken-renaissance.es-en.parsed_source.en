Islam &apos;s Forsaken Renaissance 
Children often play a game where they sit in a circle . 
One whispers something to his neighbor , who then whispers that information to the next child , and so on , around the circle . 
By the time the last child whispers the information to the first , it is totally different from what was originally said . 
Something like that seems to have happened within Islam . 
The Prophet of Islam , Muhammad , brought one - and only one - religion . 
Yet today we have perhaps a thousand religions that all claim to be Islam . 
Divided by their different interpretations , Muslims do not play the role they once did in the world ; instead , they are weakened and victimized . 
The Shia / Sunni schism is so deep that each side condemns followers of the other as apostates , kafir . 
The belief that the other &apos;s religion is not Islam , and its followers not Muslim , has underpinned internecine wars in which millions have died - and continue to die . 
Even among the Sunnis and Shias there are further divisions . 
The Sunnis have four imams and the Shias have twelve ; their teachings all differ . 
Then there are other divisions , including the Druze , the Alawites , and the Wahabis . 
We are also taught by our ulamas ( religious instructors ) that their teachings must not be questioned . 
Islam is a faith . 
It must be believed . 
Logic and reason play no part in it . 
But what is it that we must believe when each branch of Islam thinks the other one is wrong ? 
The Koran , after all , is one book , not two or three , or a thousand . 
According to the Koran , a Muslim is anyone who bears witness that &quot; there is no God ( Allah ) but Allah , and that Muhammad is his Rasul ( Messenger ) . &quot; 
If no other qualification is added , then all those who subscribe to these precepts must be regarded as Muslims . 
But because we Muslims like to add qualifications that often derive from sources other than the Koran , our religion &apos;s unity has been broken . 
But perhaps the greatest problem is the progressive isolation of Islamic scholarship - and much of Islamic life - from the rest of the modern world . 
We live in an age of science in which people can see around corners , hear and see things happening in outer space , and clone animals . 
And all of these things seem to contradict our belief in the Koran . 
This is so because those who interpret the Koran are learned only in religion , in its laws and practices , and thus are usually unable to understand today &apos;s scientific miracles . 
The fatwas ( legal opinions concerning Islamic law ) that they issue appear unreasonable and cannot be accepted by those with scientific knowledge . 
One learned religious teacher , for example , refused to believe that a man had landed on the moon . 
Others assert that the world was created 2,000 years ago . 
The age of the universe and its size measured in light years - these are things that the purely religiously trained ulamas cannot comprehend . 
This failure is largely responsible for the sad plight of so many Muslims . 
Today &apos;s oppression , the killings and the humiliations of Muslims , occurs because we are weak , unlike the Muslims of the past . 
We can feel victimized and criticize the oppressors , but to stop them we need to look at ourselves . 
We must change for our own good . 
We cannot ask our detractors to change , so that Muslims benefit . 
So what do we need to do ? 
In the past , Muslims were strong because they were learned . 
Muhammad &apos;s injunction was to read , but the Koran does not say what to read . 
Indeed , there was no &quot; Muslim scholarship &quot; at the time , so to read meant to read whatever was available . 
The early Muslims read the works of the great Greek scientists , mathematicians , and philosophers . 
They also studied the works of the Persians , the Indians , and the Chinese . 
The result was a flowering of science and mathematics . 
Muslim scholars added to the body of knowledge and developed new disciplines , such as astronomy , geography , and new branches of mathematics . 
They introduced numerals , enabling simple and limitless calculations . 
But around the fifteenth century , the learned in Islam began to curb scientific study . 
They began to study religion alone , insisting that only those who study religion - particularly Islamic jurisprudence - gain merit in the afterlife . 
The result was intellectual regression at the very moment that Europe began embracing scientific and mathematical knowledge . 
And so , as Muslims were intellectually regressing , Europeans began their renaissance , developing improved ways of meeting their needs , including the manufacture of weapons that eventually allowed them to dominate the world . 
By contrast , Muslims fatally weakened their ability to defend themselves by neglecting , even rejecting , the study of allegedly secular science and mathematics , and this myopia remains a fundamental source of the oppression suffered by Muslims today . 
Many Muslims still condemn the founder of modern Turkey , Mustafa Kamal , because he tried to modernize his country . 
But would Turkey be Muslim today without Ataturk ? 
Mustafa Kamal &apos;s clear-sightedness saved Islam in Turkey and saved Turkey for Islam . 
Failure to understand and interpret the true and fundamental message of the Koran has brought only misfortune to Muslims . 
By limiting our reading to religious works and neglecting modern science , we destroyed Islamic civilization and lost our way in the world . 
The Koran says that &quot; Allah will not change our unfortunate situation unless we make the effort to change it . &quot; 
Many Muslims continue to ignore this and , instead , merely pray to Allah to save us , to bring back our lost glory . 
But the Koran is not a talisman to be hung around the neck for protection against evil . 
Allah helps those who improve their minds .
