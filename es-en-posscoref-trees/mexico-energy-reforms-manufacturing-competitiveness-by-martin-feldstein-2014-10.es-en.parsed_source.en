Mexico &apos;s Powerful Energy Reforms 
MEXICO CITY - Mexico is poised to become Latin America &apos;s economic star in the coming decade . 
The government &apos;s recent reform of the energy sector will contribute directly to economic performance by reducing the cost of manufacturing . 
In the context of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , the resulting increase in manufacturing competitiveness promises to boost Mexico &apos;s growth substantially . 
Until the government adopted the necessary constitutional amendment and enacted the associated enabling legislation , Mexico &apos;s energy sector was entirely state-owned . 
The sector &apos;s most important component , Pemex , owned all of Mexico &apos;s oil and gas reserves , and was exclusively responsible for exploration , production , and retail distribution . 
Electricity production and distribution , too , was entirely in the hands of the government . 
Pemex &apos;s limited technical know-how meant that it could not fully develop and exploit Mexico &apos;s vast oil and gas resources . 
There are substantial oil reserves that require deep-water drilling technology that the company lacks . 
There are also old wells that have stopped producing but that could be made productive again with modern technologies . 
Until the reform , energy reserves had long been regarded as a national patrimony that could be developed only by Pemex . 
Because the constitution prohibited any direct or indirect foreign ownership , there was no way to provide incentives for foreign firms to share their technology . 
Opening the energy sector completes the agenda of economic integration that began when NAFTA was approved in 1994 . 
That agreement transformed Mexico from a very closed economy with few manufacturing exports into an economy that is now closely linked with the United States . 
The expansion of Mexican oil and gas production will consolidate those links and contribute to North American energy independence . 
Mexico &apos;s manufactured exports have increased tenfold since NAFTA began , with roughly 80 % now going to the US . 
Many multinational US companies have located plants in Mexico as part of their overall production process , which is closely tied to inputs sourced domestically . 
Indeed , manufacturing relations between the US and Mexico are such that some 40 % of the value added in Mexican exports to the US is actually of US origin . 
The new energy reforms will also allow Mexico to benefit from lower-cost gas from Canada . 
The price of gas in the US and Canada is only about half the current price in Mexico ( and less than half the price in Europe and Asia ) . 
Mexican access to cheaper gas will boost Mexican petrochemical industries and lower energy costs for manufacturing . 
Experts estimate that the cost of electricity to Mexican manufacturers could fall by as much as 20 % . 
Privatizing Pemex and the national electric company will also allow trained , professional managers to replace state bureaucrats and bring an end to trade unions &quot; current major role in the management process . 
Furthermore , privatization will remove the constraints on investment that the government budget has imposed on Pemex and the electric company . 
Even before the energy-sector reforms , Mexico had been pursuing sound macroeconomic policies for a considerable period of time . 
As a result , the country has benefited from low inflation , small fiscal deficits , and manageable current-account deficits . 
And , though Mexico operates a free-floating exchange-rate regime , the peso &apos;s value against the dollar has been stable . 
None of this is to deny that Mexico still must confront other significant problems . 
For example , primary and secondary education needs improvements that the teachers &quot; unions are blocking , and criminal activity , much of it drug-related , makes personal security a serious concern throughout the country . 
But , despite such problems , the energy and electricity reforms , and the deeper links with the US and Canada that they imply , promises to accelerate Mexico &apos;s growth rate , boost employment and income , and thus raise Mexicans &quot; standard of living .
