The Battle for Hope 
PARIS - Since the arrival of President Barack Obama in the White House , there has been an undeniable rapprochement between Europe and the United States . 
Today , there is much more collective hope and much more individual fear in America in the wake of the global economic crisis . 
But the reverse is true in Europe . 
The reason for this contrast is simple : the US has Obama , and Europe has the welfare state . 
So what can be done to promote an &quot; Americanization &quot; of Europe in political terms and a &quot; Europeanization &quot; of America in social terms ? 
Comforted by a new President who incarnates a return of hope , who inspires and reassures at the same time , Americans are starting to believe that the worst of the economic crisis is behind them . 
What was at the beginning of this spring no more than &quot; a glimmer of hope , &quot; to use Obama &apos;s phrase , has become a more serious and positive trend . 
Animated collectively by a combination of natural optimism and deep nationalism , Americans have made their president &apos;s campaign slogan , &quot; Yes , we can , &quot; their own . 
By contrast , when the personal situations of many individual Americans are examined through European eyes , the extreme individualism that constitutes a key part of American optimism translates into an unacceptable social scandal . 
&quot; Cities of Tents are Filling with the Victims of the Economic Crisis , &quot; read one headline a month ago on the front page of a mass-circulation American newspaper . 
Journalists report tragic stories of middle-class Americans losing their jobs and homes , potentially putting their lives at risk without any social protection . 
Who will pay for your costly cancer treatment if you lose the health insurance policy that came with your job ? 
It is wrong to assume , as some ultra-free marketers do , that the absence of social protection makes you stronger . 
The ambition of a country and a society born of the principles of the Enlightenment cannot be to create a people armed to the teeth with guns yet entirely disarmed in the face of illness . 
Moreover , in a society that &quot; lives to work , &quot; where one &apos;s job is such a central component of one &apos;s identity , the loss of work is more destabilizing than in a culture where one &quot; works to live , &quot; as in Europe . 
Americans &quot; perspective on retirement is highly revealing : they are afraid of it . 
What will they do ? 
This perspective is not simply rooted in economics , even if today a large proportion of older Americans are rushing back to work as the downturn wrecks their retirement plans . 
The geographic separation of families , owing to America &apos;s size and Americans &quot; mobility , makes the association between retirement and being a grandparent less practicable in the US than it is in Europe . 
In Europe , meanwhile , there is undeniably less collective hope and probably a little less individual fear . 
Perhaps because they are older and more cynical , European societies seem to bask in a &quot; collective moroseness , &quot; from which they have difficulty emerging . 
The record level of abstention in the recent European Parliament elections is further proof of that growing cynicism and alienation . 
Of course , it is neither possible nor desirable to &quot; clone &quot; Obama in each of the European Union &apos;s 27 member states . 
The answer is far from obvious . 
Europe suffers from a shortage of leaders who can speak in its name ; from a shortage of ambition ( what , after all , is the collective ambition of Europeans now that the EU is perceived more as part of the problem than part of the solution ) . 
America , by contrast , seems to have an abundance of all the things Europe lacks . 
Formulated in such terms , the European challenge seems even more formidable than the American one . 
Nevertheless , it is far from clear that the US will find it easier to reform its health and social security system , and thus alleviate the individual fears of its citizens , than for Europe to inspire its citizens with a sense of collective hope . 
In reality , Europe and America should represent a source of mutual inspiration that would reduce the human consequences of inequality in the one , and restore a sense of hope in the other .
