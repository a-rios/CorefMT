The IMF &apos;s Euro Crisis 
OXFORD - Over the last few decades , the International Monetary Fund has learned six important lessons about how to manage government debt crises . 
In its response to the crisis in Greece , however , each of these lessons has been ignored . 
The Fund &apos;s participation in the effort to rescue the eurozone may have raised its profile and gained it favor in Europe . 
But its failure , and the failure of its European shareholders , to adhere to its own best practices may eventually prove to have been a fatal misstep . 
One key lesson ignored in the Greece debacle is that when a bailout becomes necessary , it should be done once and definitively . 
The IMF learned this in 1997 , when an inadequate bailout of South Korea forced a second round of negotiations . 
In Greece , the problem is even worse , as the € 86 billion ( $ 94 billion ) plan now under discussion follows a € 110 billion bailout in 2010 and a € 130 billion rescue in 2012 . 
The IMF is , on its own , highly constrained . 
Its loans are limited to a multiple of a country &apos;s contributions to its capital , and by this measure its loans to Greece are higher than any in its history . 
Eurozone governments , however , face no such constraints , and were thus free to put in place a program that would have been sustainable . 
Another lesson that was ignored is not to bail out the banks . 
The IMF learned this the hard way in the 1980s , when it transferred bad bank loans to Latin American governments onto its own books and those of other governments . 
In Greece , bad loans issued by French and German banks were moved onto the public books , transferring the exposure not only to European taxpayers , but to the entire membership of the IMF . 
The third lesson that the IMF was unable to apply in Greece is that austerity often leads to a vicious cycle , as spending cuts cause the economy to contract far more than it would have otherwise . 
Because the IMF lends money on a short-term basis , there was an incentive to ignore the effects of austerity in order to arrive at growth projections that imply an ability to repay . 
Meanwhile , the other eurozone members , seeking to justify less financing , also found it convenient to overlook the calamitous impact of austerity . 
Fourth , the IMF has learned that reforms are most likely to be implemented when they are few in number and carefully focused . 
When a country requires assistance , it is tempting for lenders to insist on a long list of reforms . 
But a crisis-wracked government will struggle to manage multiple demands . 
In Greece , the IMF , together with its European partners , required the government not just to cut expenditures , but to undertake far-reaching tax , pension , judicial , and labor-market reforms . 
And , although the most urgently needed measures will not have an immediate effect on Greece &apos;s finances , the IMF has little choice but to emphasize the short-term spending cuts that boost the chances of being repaid - even when that makes longer-term reforms more difficult to enact . 
A fifth lesson is that reforms are unlikely to succeed unless the government is committed to seeing them through . 
Conditions perceived to be imposed from abroad will almost certainly fail . 
In the case of Greece , domestic political considerations caused European governments to make a show of holding the government &apos;s feet to the fire . 
The IMF , too , sought to demonstrate that it was being as tough with Greece as it has been on Brazil , Indonesia , and Zambia - even if doing so was ultimately counterproductive . 
The sixth lesson the IMF has swept aside is that bailing out countries that do not fully control their currencies carries additional risks . 
As the Fund learned in Argentina and West Africa , such countries lack one of the easiest ways to adjust to a debt crisis : devaluation . 
Having failed to forewarn Greece , Portugal , Ireland , and Spain about the perils of joining a currency bloc , the IMF should have considered whether it was proper or necessary for it to intervene at all in the eurozone crisis . 
Its rationale for doing so highlights the risks associated with its decision . 
The most obvious reason for the IMF &apos;s actions is that Europe was failing to address its own problems , and had the power and influence to drag in the Fund . 
The IMF &apos;s managing director has always been a European , and European countries enjoy a disproportionate share of the votes on the IMF &apos;s board . 
Equally important , however , is the fact that the IMF made its decision while facing an existential crisis . 
Historically , the biggest threat to the IMF has been irrelevance . 
It was almost made redundant in the 1970s , when the US floated the dollar , only to be saved in 1982 by the Mexican debt crisis , which propelled it into the role of global financial lifeguard . 
A decade later , the IMF &apos;s relevance had started to wane again , but was revived by its role in the transformation of the former Soviet-bloc economies . 
At the time of the euro crisis , the Fund was floundering once more in the aftermath of the East Asian crisis , as its fee-paying clients did anything they could to avoid turning to it . 
The IMF &apos;s participation in the eurozone crisis has now given powerful emerging economies another reason to be disenchanted . 
After the US stymied their demands for a greater say within the Fund , they now find that the organization has been doing Europe &apos;s bidding . 
It will be difficult for the IMF to regain the trust of these increasingly prominent members . 
Unless the US and the EU relinquish their grip , the Fund &apos;s latest bid for relevance may well turn out to be its last .
