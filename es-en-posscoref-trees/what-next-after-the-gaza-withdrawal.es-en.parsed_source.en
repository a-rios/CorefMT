What Next After the Gaza Withdrawal ? 
The withdrawal of Israeli troops and the evacuation of Jewish settlers from Gaza , after 38 years of occupation , is the most recent proof of the limits of military power , even when that power is overwhelming . 
Now is the time to take stock of the lessons learned from the years of occupation and resistance in order to understand what Israelis and Palestinians should do next . 
To begin with , it is imperative to understand how much credit Palestinians can credibly claim for the Israeli withdrawal . 
True , Palestinian resistance and sacrifices were a contributing factor in Ariel Sharon &apos;s decision to reverse a policy he had espoused for decades . 
After all , this bittersweet Israeli action was neither a clear result of military defeat nor a consequence of political negotiations . 
But unilateralism is not a rational long-term and effective policy , for it will not lead to a genuine and lasting peace in the Middle East . 
Just as President Bush has discovered in Iraq , Sharon will also be forced to acknowledge the limits of his strategy . 
Unilateralism seems very expedient to shortsighted politicians , for it obviates the need for what they perceive as the mess of actual negotiations - that is , meeting their counterparts face to face and discovering the human results of their policies . 
Going it alone also seems politically advantageous domestically , because leaders can decide how much and how far they want to carry out a particular policy . 
To be fair , unilateralism is convenient not only for a reluctant Israeli prime minister who does not wish to make substantial compromises during negotiations ; it is also attractive to hard-line Palestinians who regard multilateralism as a means of pressing them to make unpopular concessions . 
In any case , the day after the completion of the Gaza withdrawal , Israelis and Palestinians will be confronted with important unresolved questions . 
There is no doubt that the evacuation of Jewish settlers in areas that Israelis consider part of their God-given territory represents a huge ideological reversal . 
Palestinians , for their part , will be expected to answer questions - in deeds , not just in words - about their ability to build a modern pluralistic state . 
How will the Palestinian body politic deal with the growing power of the Islamic movements that undoubtedly will expect a significant share of power in post-withdrawal Gaza ? 
The international community also will have to answer some key questions . 
According to the Palestinian Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development ( PECDAR ) , annual per capita income in Gaza continues to average roughly $ 700 , while Israelis enjoy incomes averaging a $ 16,000 per capita . 
In the absence of relatively well-paying jobs , what will happen to the lines of unemployed Gazans ? 
The potential flight of employment seekers - a formidable force worldwide - is only one problem . 
More immediately , if Gazan families are not well fed , the recurrence of cross-border violence , if not the eruption of a third intifada , will only be a matter of time . 
While the economic situation in Gaza is a critical issue , the future of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will be determined mainly by the next steps in the peace process . 
Permanent-status issues concerning borders , the West Bank , Jerusalem , and refugees must be dealt with bilaterally . 
Any serious observer of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will no doubt acknowledge that there can be no unilateral solution to these issues . 
As for the peace process &apos;s multilateral guarantors , the United States and its quartet partners - the European Union , the United Nations , and Russia - have failed to provide even the most basic facts regarding Israel &apos;s withdrawal or how it relates to the &quot; road map &quot; agreed in 2003 . 
They cannot continue to sit on the sidelines . Washington &apos;s quixotic decision to call Israel &apos;s unilateral move part of the road map has failed to convince many Palestinians . 
The prevailing opinion among Palestinians is that the road map will be put into deep freeze once the Israelis complete their Gaza withdrawal . 
But the Palestinian and Israeli peoples , their leaders , and the international community must all respond to the challenges that will follow . 
Most importantly , the future of the conflict and the chances for genuine peace in the region will depend on understanding the limits of offensive military power , defensive resistance , and unilateralism . 
Serious face-to-face talks , in accordance to international law and with the help of the international community , are the only way forward .
