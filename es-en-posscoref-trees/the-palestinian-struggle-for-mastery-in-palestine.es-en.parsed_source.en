The Palestinian Struggle for Mastery in Palestine 
Israel &apos;s reoccupation of Palestinian cities and towns culminates a predictable pattern . 
American willingness to accept Ariel Sharon &apos;s portrayal of that reoccupation as an acceptable part of its global &quot; war against terror &quot; was not only surprising , but misguided and dangerous . 
By helping to de-legitimize Yasir Arafat and by accepting Prime Minister Sharon &apos;s characterization of Israel &apos;s reoccupation as &quot; self-defense , &quot; American policy threatens to weaken the moral clarity and credibility of the US in the eyes of the world . 
Eighteen months of violent Israeli-Palestinian confrontations have set new dynamics in motion . 
These follow a predictable pattern , locking the two sides into an escalation that will push toward a total and final confrontation . 
It now seems doubtful that these dynamics can be contained . 
Secretary of State Colin Powell &apos;s April mission was doomed to failure because American policy failed to reverse , or even address , the causes of deterioration . 
On the Palestinian side , the current intifada created a Young Guard that despises the Old Guard , represented by Yasir Arafat and the Palestinian Authority . 
Unlike the members of the Old Guard who spent much of their lives outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip , the Young Guard is a product of domestic Palestinian society . 
Not just younger , they are more educated than the old leaders , and are convinced that they know better how to deal with Israel . 
While the two groups share the vision of a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict , the Young Guard tends to rule out any return to previous channels of negotiation . 
These , they argue , served to consolidate the Old Guard &apos;s domination of Palestinian politics . 
Fueled by the failure of the peace process to deliver an end to Israel &apos;s occupation , and by the Old Guard &apos;s failure to deliver good governance , the Young Guard allied themselves with radical Islamists . 
Despite important ideological and political disagreements with the Islamists , the young nationalists hoped that alliance would strengthen their hand against the Old Guard and increase pressure on the Israelis . 
Supported by an enraged and desperate public , this new alliance set out to achieve two goals : 1 ) to displace the Old Guard of the PLO , and 2 ) to use violence to end Israel &apos;s 35-year-old occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip , using Israel &apos;s unilateral withdrawal from South Lebanon as a model . 
Most Palestinians support violent attacks because they believe that only violence will end the occupation , not negotiation . 
This extends to suicide bombing , an immoral and cruel act of terror . 
In a widespread Palestinian view , suicide bombing creates a &quot; balance of terror &quot; that may , over time , neutralize Israel &apos;s superior firepower . 
Suicide bombings make Israelis feel vulnerable , and comprise , Palestinians hope , a powerful incentive to end the occupation . 
So the intifada produced the first big change in the balance of Palestinian political power since the peace process began a decade ago , with more and more people shifting loyalty from the nationalists to the Islamists . 
Support for the Islamists , which stood in 1995 at about 15 % , doubled to 30 % by 2001 . 
Support for the nationalists decreased from 55 % to 30 % over the same period . 
With some 40 % of the population uncommitted to either camp , the competition between the two forces is far from resolution . 
By destroying the Palestinian Authority &apos;s civil and security infrastructure , Israel dealt a severe blow to the PA &apos;s ability to deliver services to this &quot; up-for-grabs &quot; population . 
The Islamists will likely see further gains . 
The nationalist Young Guard , which suffered a serious setback during the April reoccupation , will likely remain a powerful force in Palestinian politics - for now . 
In the long run , the ability of the national movement to continue to lead will be put to the test . 
On the Israeli side , the new dynamics include loss of public confidence in the peaceful intentions of the Palestinians . 
So Israelis turned to a hard-line leadership . 
So long as they feel threatened , Israelis are likely to choose leaders committed to a military solution to Israel &apos;s security problems . 
This could lead to a long-term reoccupation of Palestinian areas . 
But a long-term reoccupation of the West Bank could destroy whatever moderate elements remain in the Palestinian leadership , closing the door on further peacemaking for years to come . 
That would threaten Israel &apos;s peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan , as popular anger at Israel turns against pro-American regimes in the region . 
Unlike President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon , most of the world sees a clear difference between the American-led war against al-Qaida and Israel &apos;s war against the Palestinians . 
The US never occupied Afghanistan , but Israel occupies Palestinian land . 
It is not just Osama bin Laden &apos;s means that are condemned everywhere , but also his cause . 
Unlike bin Laden , the Palestinian cause enjoys nearly universal support among Arabs and Muslims . 
While America found many Arab and Muslim countries willing to support the US campaign against al-Qaida , none endorses a war that equates Palestinian violence against Israeli occupation with the terror of al-Qaida . 
A successful Israeli effort to make that equation plausible would abruptly turn a legitimate global war against terror into a war against Arabs and Muslims , indeed a war against Islam , which is precisely what the Bush administration seeks to avoid . 
If that happens , Sharon will have succeeded where bin Laden failed .
