Swimming With Sharks in Mexico 
MEXICO CITY - As the saying goes : when the tide goes out , you find out who has been swimming without a bathing suit . 
Few countries have emerged as naked from the receding waters of the global economic crisis as Mexico . Saddled with an economic contraction of 8 % of GDP , higher than any other Latin American country , Mexico is also slipping in the global competitiveness index , lags behind in key social indicators , is being downgraded by investment ratings agencies , and faces the prospect of declining oil revenues , owing to a dramatic drop in production . 
According to recent official data , 50.1 million Mexicans - out of a total population of 104 million - live below the poverty line , and 17.5 million do not have enough money to eat . 
So a country that has managed to produce Carlos Slim , reckoned to be the second wealthiest man in the world , produces millions of others who scrape by on two dollars a day . 
Mexico has long considered itself the leader of Latin America , but Chile , Colombia , and the rising regional giant , Brazil , are increasingly leaving it behind . 
Over the past 20 years , oil functioned as a type of life jacket for Mexico &apos;s economy . 
It hid economic distortions , allowing successive governments to postpone needed structural reform as it financed the status quo . 
Mexico was able to float along , buoyed by billions of dollars of oil revenue , without having to swim more quickly or forcefully than its competitors in the sea of emerging markets . 
But now that oil production at Pemex , the state owned oil monopoly , is plummeting , the country faces some hard truths that the oil bonanza obscured . 
The government had become too dependent on a non-renewable resource , and therefore did little to deepen or widen the tax base . 
Moreover , the manufacturing sector had become too dependent on US-driven export demand , and the population had become too dependent on remittances from emigrants working in the US . 
The global financial crisis thus revealed the Mexican economy &apos;s inability to innovate , promote investment , create jobs , or provide conditions for social mobility . 
The fault does not lie exclusively in President Felipe Calderón &apos;s timid counter-cyclical measures , or in the country &apos;s social policy , or in the drop of manufacturing exports , or in the US financial crisis . 
Mexico &apos;s essential problem in achieving accelerated economic growth lies elsewhere . 
Over the past 20 years , the usual culprits seem to be low labor productivity , bad macroeconomic management , and divided governments that make legislative consensus almost impossible . 
But the fundamental explanation lies in a crony capitalist system with too many vested interests to maintain . 
Government after government has prioritized the preservation of corporatist loyalties over the promotion of economic growth and emphasized clientelist distribution over entrepreneurial innovation and creation of level economic playing field . 
Mexico is trapped by a dense network of rent-seekers and monopolies in sectors that are crucial for economic growth , including telecommunications , energy , transportation , and financial services . 
This network operates on the basis of political favors , collusion , regulatory capture , and the maintenance of privileges that the government offers in public-sector unions in return for political support . 
As the new book No Growth Without Equity ? 
There are too many unions , monopolists , and bureaucrats that behave like hungry sharks , accustomed to feeding off oil revenues and appropriating the extraordinary wealth that Mexico produces but does not share in an equitable and democratic way . 
Regrettably , the promotion of economic growth has not been a priority for either the Calderón administration or that of his predecessor , Vicente Fox . 
For too long , government officials have tinkered with Mexico &apos;s economic structure through piecemeal reforms that seek to ensure political stability , but that do not address the key obstacles to greater innovation and competitiveness . 
The results have become increasingly obvious and painful : an economy that has suffered more severely in the global crisis than its neighbors to the south ; a rent-seeking business elite that is unaccustomed to competition ; public and private monopolies that no one seems to have the political will to dismantle ; and corporatist pacts that siphon off public resources to unproductive unions , thwarting productivity and growth . 
What the current crisis has proved is that Mexico cannot continue to float , ignoring its nakedness . 
It needs to rethink the fundamentals of an economy and political system in which entrenched interests have become &quot; veto centers &quot; for reform . 
Otherwise , when the tide comes back in , Mexico will find itself struggling to survive in shark-infested waters .
