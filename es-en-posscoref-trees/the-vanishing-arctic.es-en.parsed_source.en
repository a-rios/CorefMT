The Vanishing Arctic 
BERLIN - Largely unnoticed , a silent drama has been unfolding over the past weeks in the Arctic . 
The long-term consequences will far outstrip those of the international debt crisis or the demise of the Libyan dictatorship , the news stories now commanding media attention . 
The drama - more accurately , a tragedy - playing out in the North is the rapid disappearance of the polar ice cap , the Arctic Ocean &apos;s defining feature . 
In September , the sea-ice cover on the Arctic Ocean melted all the way back to the record-low level recorded in September 2007 . 
At 4.4 million square kilometers , it was the smallest ice cover since satellite observations began 40 years ago , with 40 % less ice than in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s . 
Back in 2007 , the record low stunned climate scientists , who considered it an outlier in an otherwise much slower decline in sea-ice cover . 
We blamed unusual wind conditions in the Arctic that year . 
But satellite data since then have proven us wrong . 
This year , we reached the same low level without exceptional wind conditions . 
It is now clear that we are not just seeing a steady decline of sea-ice cover , but a rapidly accelerating decline . 
If this continues , we will probably see an ice-free North Pole within the next 10-20 years . 
Yes , that sounds shocking . 
But there is good reason to fear that the rate of decline will indeed continue to rise , and that satellite images of a blue polar ocean will grace the covers of news magazines sooner rather than later . 
The reason is that the ice is also getting thinner . 
This is harder to measure than the area of ice cover , which is easily viewed by satellites . 
But various data , including measurements from ships and aircraft , confirm that the ice has thinned by roughly half since the 1980 &quot; s . 
This also makes physical sense , given the rapid warming in the Arctic . 
If the ice cover simultaneously shrinks and gets thinner , then the shrinkage in area is first steady but then accelerates towards the end , when the remaining ice becomes ever thinner and more vulnerable to melting . 
This is what I fear is happening now . 
Yearly estimates show that 2011 set an all-time low for overall ice volume - which is computed from area and thickness - in the Arctic Ocean . 
Ice volume is already down to about one-third of what it was in the 1980 &quot; s . 
If the downward trend in ice volume of the past 20 years merely continues at a constant pace , practically no ice will be left in 10-15 years . 
Global warming , caused by our greenhouse-gas emissions , is thus far continuing unabated . 
2010 was one of the two hottest years on record globally , despite extremely low solar activity . 
Thus , it is almost certain that warming - including in the Arctic - will continue in the coming decades . 
And the ice will continue to melt . 
This loss of ice will not only turn the Arctic ecosystem upside down , affecting many animals that are adapted to a life with sea ice . 
It will affect all of us . 
If the Arctic ice disappears in the summer months , we will lose a giant mirror that reflects solar heat back into space and helps keep the planet cool . 
The ice loss will amplify global warming and upset weather patterns . 
But the ice loss will amplify warming especially in the Arctic - indeed , this is already happening . 
Moreover , disproportionate Arctic warming is already affecting one of the most important components of the global climate system : the Greenland Ice Sheet . 
If this giant structure melts , sea levels worldwide would rise by about seven meters . 
And this melting , it appears , has already begun . 
As NASA data revealed earlier this year , the Greenland Ice Sheet is losing mass at an accelerating pace . 
As tide gauges from around the world show , sea levels are indeed rising . 
The warmer it gets , the faster the sea rises . 
While sea level was nearly constant for centuries after the Middle Ages , it rose at an average rate of almost two centimeters per decade during the twentieth century . 
Over the past two decades , the rate has exceeded three centimeters per decade . 
While future sea level is hard to predict , most experts would agree that unabated global warming could lead in the coming centuries to a rise measured in meters , threatening the very existence of many coastal cities and entire island nations . 
Already at the end of this century , sea level could well be one meter higher than it is now , unless we act rapidly and decisively to curb our greenhouse-gas emissions . 
This is why we ignore the silent meltdown in the North at our own peril . 
It is a sign of global warming - and a grave warning sign for us all .
