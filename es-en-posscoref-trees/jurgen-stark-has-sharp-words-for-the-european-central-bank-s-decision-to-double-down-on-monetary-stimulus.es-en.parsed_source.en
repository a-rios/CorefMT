The ECB &apos;s Leap into the Unknown 
FRANKFURT - The European Central Bank is in the middle of a big , risky experiment . 
Key interest rates have remained close to zero for six years now . 
Financial markets are flooded with liquidity . 
Crisis management has resulted in major market distortions , with some segments &quot; performance no longer explainable by fundamental economic data . 
The unintended consequences of this policy are increasingly visible - and will become increasingly tangible with the US Federal Reserve &apos;s exit from post-2008 ultra-loose monetary policy . 
And yet Europe &apos;s crisis is far from over , as the decisions by the European Central Bank &apos;s Governing Council in June and September demonstrate . 
This reflects two factors : too little ambition in carrying out essential balance-sheet corrections , and slow progress - negligible in France and Italy - in restructuring Europe &apos;s national economies . 
The ECB &apos;s decision to double down on monetary stimulus should thus be regarded as an act of desperation . 
Its key rate has been cut to 0.05 % , the deposit rate is negative , and targeted longer-term refinancing operations are supposed to support bank lending . 
Moreover , the asset-backed securities market is to be revived by the purchase of ABSs . 
All of this is intended to flood the markets , expand the euro system &apos;s balance sheet by â‚¬ 700 billion ( $ 890 billion ) , and return to the balance-sheet volume recorded at the start of 2012 . 
The expansion of the ECB &apos;s balance sheet and the targeted depreciation of the euro should help to bring the eurozone &apos;s short-term inflation rate close to 2 % and thus reduce deflationary risks . 
For the first time in its history , the ECB appears to be pursuing an exchange-rate target . 
As was the case for the Bank of Japan , the external value of the currency will become an important instrument in the framework of a new strategic approach . 
Financial markets have applauded the ECB &apos;s recent decisions . 
Moreover , having &quot; effectively thrown off all of the Maastricht Treaty restrictions that bound the bank to the model of the Deutsche Bundesbank , &quot; as former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan put it , the ECB is prepared to break further taboos . 
But for what purpose ? 
Particularly by guaranteeing highly indebted countries &quot; sovereign bonds , the ECB has actually weakened the willingness to reform , particularly in the larger European Union countries , whose decrepit economic structures are an obstacle to potential growth , and where more room must be given to private initiative . 
The ECB &apos;s willingness to buy ABSs is especially risky and creates a new element of joint liability in the eurozone , with European taxpayers on the hook in the event of a loss . 
The ECB lacks the democratic legitimacy to take such far-reaching decisions , with potentially substantial redistributive effects , which implies an even greater risk to monetary-policy independence . 
Indeed , the ECB already has been driven onto the defensive by the International Monetary Fund , the OECD , financial-market analysts , and Anglo-Saxon economists in the wake of feverish discussion of the risk of deflation in the eurozone . 
Should higher nominal ( that is , inflation-driven ) growth replace debt-driven growth ? 
Europe must aim for sustainable , non-inflationary growth and the creation of competitive jobs . 
The current inflation rate of 0.3 % is due to the significant decline in commodity prices and the painful but unavoidable adjustment of costs and prices in the peripheral countries . 
Only Greece currently has a slightly negative inflation rate . 
In other words , price stability reigns in the eurozone . 
The ECB has fulfilled its mandate for the present and the foreseeable future . 
There is no need for policy action in the short term . 
It is , instead , the eurozone governments that must act . 
Government action in many problem countries ultimately ends in finger pointing : &quot; Europe , &quot; the ECB , and Germany , with its ( relatively ) responsible policy , have all been scapegoats . 
Against this background , the ECB has yielded to immense political pressure , particularly from France and Italy , to loosen monetary policy further and weaken the exchange rate . 
It will not eliminate the structural weaknesses of the countries in question . 
The ECB is moving ever farther into uncharted territory . 
In view of the insufficient balance-sheet corrections in the private sector and inadequate structural reforms , macroeconomic demand-management tools will not work . 
Despite the ECB &apos;s aggressive approach , monetary policy in the absence of structural economic reform risks being ineffective . 
Simply put , more liquidity will not lead to more active bank lending until there is more transparency regarding the extent of non-performing loans and the relevant economies have become more flexible . 
The ECB &apos;s asset quality review and bank stress tests are expected to bring some clarity to the first question . 
Then , more lending will occur on acceptable terms - assuming that there is corresponding demand . 
The ECB &apos;s recent decisions , with their focus on short-term effects , indicate that monetary policy is no longer targeted at the eurozone as a whole , but at its problem members . 
Ad hoc decisions have replaced a feasible and principled medium-term strategy . 
The problems created by this approach will be compounded by the unavoidable conflicts of interest with monetary policy implied by the ECB &apos;s assumption of its new financial-stability and banking-supervision roles . 
The first casualty will most likely be price stability .
