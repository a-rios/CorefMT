Latin America &apos;s Irrational Exuberance 
MONTEVIDEO - Latin America is coming to the end of an extraordinary cycle of growth that has transformed much of the continent , especially its commodity-exporting countries . 
But , as the boom recedes , a deep , debilitating weakness is becoming increasingly apparent : the region &apos;s inadequate education systems . 
This shortcoming undermines the continent &apos;s longer-term economic prospects , social stability , and fight against poverty . 
Such dire warnings have been obscured in recent years by headline-grabbing GDP figures . 
From 2004 to 2011 ( excluding the crisis year of 2009 ) , the region almost doubled its long-run average growth rate . 
This sustained period of expansion was all the more noteworthy because it followed a half-century of relative decline , with Latin America &apos;s per capita income relative to the United States falling from around 50 % in the 1950 &quot; s to 23 % in 2004 . 
Faster economic growth , rising incomes , and wealth redistribution over the past decade - fueled by sound macroeconomic policies , foreign investment , and rocketing commodity prices - have helped to reduce poverty rates by 13 percentage points , and extreme poverty by five percentage points . 
This has expanded the middle class ( as measured by household income ) , which in turn has helped the region consolidate democracy . 
The good times were also buoyed by easier access to low-cost capital , much of which has come in the wake of the global financial crisis . 
As investors sought the higher yields on land , property , equities , bonds , and bank deposits that were attainable in emerging markets after 2008 , capital inflows to Latin America tripled , boosting asset prices , credit , and aggregate demand . 
Now , with the prospect of rising interest rates in the advanced countries causing a reversal of capital flows , the economic picture has come into full view - and it is not nearly as bright as it previously appeared . 
Once foreign investment and higher commodity export prices are excluded from the growth calculations , Latin America &apos;s recent economic performance barely exceeds its unexceptional historical average . 
A similar point can be made about improvements in the region &apos;s total factor productivity . 
A more telling indicator of progress - or lack of it - is the minimal improvement in education . 
According to a recent survey of 65 mainly emerging countries worldwide by the Program for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) , which ranks countries by their education standards , around half of Latin American 15-year-olds performed below the basic levels in math , science , and reading comprehension . 
While standards for students in the region &apos;s upper socioeconomic quintile rose over the past decade , there was little change in the lower quintile , where 70 % of students failed to reach the most basic levels . 
In other words , half of all students in their final year of compulsory education , before entering the workforce , lack the minimum skills required by employers . 
For many graduates , these gaps will never be bridged in later life . 
The weakness in Latin America &apos;s education systems reinforces a less rosy view of its economic success in recent years - one that attributes strong performance mainly to favorable external conditions , not improved productivity . 
Indeed , if measured by skill levels rather than income , the region &apos;s social and economic achievements - including the much-vaunted expansion of the new middle class - are far more tenuous than previously assumed . 
The consequences of an uneducated labor force are alarming . 
Workers are either forced into the informal sector , where basic workplace protections are absent , or they become reliant on state handouts , creating fertile ground for populist politicians and criminals . 
The boom did little to reduce crime , and may even have contributed to it by attracting those who felt unfairly excluded from the rising prosperity around them . 
The region &apos;s economies are now cooling and incomes are flattening , and low-cost capital inflows will no longer encourage public- and private-sector consumption . 
Tougher economic conditions in Latin America , and in the world economy generally , will eventually force spending back into line with earnings , causing economic upheaval , rending the social safety net , frustrating hopes of a better life , and leading inevitably to social unrest . 
If this scenario is to be avoided , political leaders must take a long view of economic growth . 
Essential to this is an understanding that a fair and prosperous society needs young people who are educated to the standards required of a modern workforce . 
If a good education remains the preserve of the elite , no amount of irrational exuberance will be able to mask the long-term threat to economic growth and political stability .
