The Flawed Options in Darfur 
The long-sought joint peacekeeping force for Darfur , which would combine the existing 7,000-man African Union force with as many as 20,000 additional military personnel and civilian police under UN command , has now been approved . 
But several roadblocks still stand in the way , making it very difficult for the joint AU-UN mission to bring about a peaceful settlement to the Darfur conflict . 
Although UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pressed the UN Security Council to move rapidly to authorize the proposed joint force , member governments remain deadlocked over its mandate . 
With the encouragement of Sudan &apos;s government , China and Russia have thus far blocked a resolution sponsored by Britain and France that would allow the proposed hybrid force &quot; to use all necessary means &quot; to protect humanitarian workers and other civilians . 
Sudan &apos;s UN ambassador has called for a draft whose language is &quot; more Sudan-friendly . &quot; 
Moreover , UN analysts estimate that most of the additional troops will not arrive in Darfur until early next year . 
The preceding phase envisages only providing the existing AU force with extra logistical support from non-African countries , such as engineers from China . 
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner has called for merging these two phases to accelerate progress , which would require substantial funds to secure and deploy the additional UN peacekeepers . 
According to Jean-Marie Guehenno , the head of UN peacekeeping operations , any hybrid force must be &quot; robust &quot; because of the &quot; very challenging &quot; situation in Darfur . 
The draft British-French resolution would provide for an authorized ceiling of 19,555 military troops and 6,400 police officers , with an estimated cost of over $ 2 billion during its first year . 
The Bush administration has been a leading advocate of deploying a robust peacekeeping operation in Darfur . 
But the United States is impeding this process by falling far behind in its obligatory payments to the UN peacekeeping budget , with total US arrears estimated at more than $ 500 million - and possibly exceeding $ 1 billion by the end of 2007 . 
The EU has also encountered difficulties in fulfilling its pledged financial assistance to the existing AU force in Darfur . 
Moreover , the division of labor for any joint mission - especially regarding financing and command - remains unresolved . 
Many African leaders insist that they should retain principal control of any peacekeeping force in Darfur . 
Their preferred model calls for the UN to provide the funding and most other support for the mission , while allowing the AU to maintain its leadership role . 
Many Western governments , however , refuse to place their forces under AU command , owing to its perceived weaknesses , and have conditioned further support for peacekeeping operations in Darfur on the UN &apos;s assuming control . 
But the UN has found it difficult to attract sufficient volunteers for such a force , since foreign governments have acceded to Sudanese demands that the hybrid force remain predominantly African . 
At the same time , the complex chain of command envisaged for an AU-UN force recalls some of the worst features of NATO-UN operations in the former Yugoslavia during the 1990 &quot; s . 
AU commanders on the ground would retain tactical control , a joint AU-UN command would exercise operational supervision , and the UN would establish the force &apos;s overall strategic objectives . 
Such a convoluted command system will make it difficult to react to any rapidly developing crisis or threat . 
Indeed , even if foreign troops reduce the violence , peace might last only as long as they remain deployed , since the conflict has evolved from a struggle between rebel groups and the Sudanese government into one between various clans and ethnic groups , with the government intervening on behalf of its allies . 
The example of Kosovo is revealing . 
Eight years after the 1999 NATO intervention , a 17,000-strong international force is still needed to prevent a resurgence of violence , and Kosovo &apos;s ultimate political status remains unresolved . 
A major peacekeeping operation in Darfur would likely produce a similar situation : protracted uncertainties regarding the region &apos;s future political status , impeded socioeconomic development , persistently diverging expectations among the conflicting parties , unresolved tensions resulting from non-fulfillment of these expectations , and the likelihood of renewed violence should the foreign intervention force withdraw . 
In addition , an extensive military operation in Darfur would not necessarily secure the region unless it also addressed the problems in the rest of Sudan . 
The UN Human Rights Committee has found that widespread and systematic human rights abuses extend throughout Sudan , not just Darfur . 
Foreign Policy magazine considers Sudan the country most at risk of state failure . 
For these reasons , any major peace operation involving Western countries would soon lead their governments to consider regime change in Khartoum as the most viable exit strategy . 
Because the Sudanese government recognizes this as well , it will resist any such deployment , regardless of foreign threats and blandishments .
