Obama &apos;s Doomed &quot; Reset &quot; 
MOSCOW - When US President Barack Obama canceled last month &apos;s scheduled summit in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin , he effectively terminated his four-year effort to &quot; reset &quot; the bilateral relationship . 
The failure of that effort should come as no surprise , owing to its deeply flawed foundations . 
While the obvious catalyst for Obama &apos;s decision was Putin &apos;s grant of temporary asylum to the former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden , the bilateral relationship has long been faltering . 
In 2011 , after the US and its allies convinced Russia &apos;s former president , Dmitri Medvedev , not to block a United Nations resolution to impose a no-fly zone over Libya , they launched a full-scale military bombardment of Libya , which helped to bring down the regime - a move that Russian officials called &quot; deceptive . &quot; 
Since Putin &apos;s return to the presidency last year , the relationship has deteriorated further , owing to disagreements over arms control , missile defense , and human rights . 
For example , late last year , the US Congress imposed sanctions against Russian officials implicated in human-rights abuses , prompting Russia to institute a ban on adoptions by American families . 
Moreover , Obama and Putin remain at odds over the crisis in Syria . Obama continues to support President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s ouster , while Putin has been backing the regime , owing to fear that its collapse would usher in a radical Sunni-led government - or chaos . 
Farther east , the US and Russia are not cooperating as expected on Afghanistan &apos;s post-war transition . 
But , while disagreement on these issues has undoubtedly weakened US-Russian ties , the real reason that the bilateral relationship has been crumbling is more fundamental . 
Instead of acknowledging geopolitical shifts , and adjusting their relationship accordingly , US and Russian officials remain committed to an obsolete post-Cold War dynamic . 
While Russia and the US remain capable of destroying each other many times over , they have had no intention of doing so for a long time . 
But admitting that there was no longer any threat of direct attack would have been politically impossible in the aftermath of the Cold War , when the bilateral standoff still seemed to be a cornerstone of international stability . 
Today , the prospect of either country launching a nuclear attack against the other seems almost ridiculous . 
Given this , the legacy of the Cold War should give way to issues like ensuring that China &apos;s rise remains peaceful , preventing the current chaos in the Arab world from spreading beyond the region , limiting the scope of nuclear-weapons proliferation , and contributing to global efforts to address climate change , water scarcity , food security , and cyber-crime . 
But , rather than pursuing joint initiatives aimed at advancing the two countries &quot; shared interests in these areas , the US proposed nuclear-weapons reductions as the primary mechanism of the diplomatic reset . 
Russian diplomats , whose outlook also remains largely shaped by the Cold War , seized on the proposal . 
And , just like that , the old disarmament dynamic was renewed , as if by nostalgic old friends . 
The subsequent negotiations produced the much-vaunted New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( New START ) , which , despite doing little to advance disarmament , provided a political boost to both sides and bolstered the bilateral relationship . 
But progress soon stalled , with Russia rejecting US proposals for further reductions , especially of tactical nuclear weapons - an area in which Russia dominates . 
Russia , whose nuclear arsenal represents one of the last remaining pillars of its &quot; great power &quot; status , declared that it would agree to further cuts only after the US offered a legally binding agreement that its proposed anti-ballistic missile ( ABM ) shield in Europe would not be aimed at Russia . 
In Russia &apos;s view - which is , probably , fanciful - such a shield could intercept its intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) , thereby posing a strategic threat . 
In the hope of breaking the deadlock , Obama signaled his willingness to compromise . 
But Putin had little reason to reciprocate , not least because agreement on the issue would have opened the way to further nuclear-arms reductions . 
Moreover , members of Russia &apos;s military and political elite hoped to use some of the country &apos;s oil revenues to deploy a new generation of ICBMs . 
And it seems that some Russians began to believe their own propaganda about the danger posed by a European ABM shield . 
By focusing on nuclear disarmament and New START , Obama &apos;s reset strategy remilitarized the US-Russia relationship , while marginalizing issues that could have reoriented bilateral ties toward the future . 
In this sense , the initiative was doomed from the start - and the whole world has suffered as a result . 
Both countries &quot; leaders should acknowledge what should now be obvious : nuclear-weapons reduction can no longer serve as a reliable basis for bilateral relations . 
But the recent US-Russian agreement regarding the removal and destruction of Syria &apos;s chemical-weapons stockpiles offers hope that the two sides are beginning to set a new agenda , based on international law and a shared desire to prevent further deterioration of the desperate situation in the Middle East . 
Indeed , it is possible that Putin &apos;s Syrian intervention will beget greater global influence for Russia . By proposing a diplomatic solution to the use of chemical weapons in Syria , Putin offered Obama a way out of the political impasse - threatening a military intervention with little support at home or abroad - in which he found himself . If Syria &apos;s chemical weapons are destroyed , the agreement will have established an invaluable precedent concerning the behavior of great powers in a time of crisis .
