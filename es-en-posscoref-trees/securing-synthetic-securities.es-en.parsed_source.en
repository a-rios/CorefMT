Securing Synthetic Securities 
NEW YORK - Goldman Sachs , we can be sure , will vigorously contest the civil suit brought against it by the United States Security and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) . 
But , regardless of the eventual outcome , the case has far-reaching implications for the financial reform legislation that the US Congress is now considering . 
Whether or not Goldman is guilty , the transaction in question clearly had no social benefit . 
It involved a complex synthetic security that was derived from existing mortgage-backed securities by cloning them into imaginary units that mimicked the originals . 
This synthetic collateralized debt obligation ( CDO ) did not finance the ownership of any additional homes or allocate capital more efficiently ; it merely swelled the volume of mortgage-backed securities that lost value when the housing bubble burst . 
The primary purpose of the transaction was to generate fees and commissions . 
This is a clear demonstration of how derivatives and synthetic securities were used to create imaginary value out of thin air . 
Indeed , more triple-A CDOs were created than there were underlying triple-A assets . 
This was done on a large scale , despite the fact that all of the parties involved were sophisticated investors . 
The process continued for years , culminating in a crash that caused wealth destruction amounting to trillions of dollars . 
Such activity cannot be allowed to continue . 
The use of derivatives and other synthetic instruments must be regulated , even if all the parties are sophisticated investors . 
Ordinary securities must be registered with the SEC before they can be traded . 
Synthetic securities need to be similarly regulated , although the task could be assigned to a different authority , such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission . 
Derivatives can serve many useful purposes , but they also contain hidden dangers . 
For instance , they can pile up hidden imbalances in supply or demand , which may suddenly be revealed when a threshold is breached . 
This is true of so-called &quot; knockout options , &quot; used in currency hedging . 
It was also true of the portfolio insurance programs that caused the New York Stock Exchange &apos;s Black Monday of October 1987 . 
The subsequent introduction of circuit-breakers tacitly acknowledged that derivatives can cause disruptions , but the proper conclusions were not drawn . 
Credit default swaps ( CDS ) are particularly suspicious instruments . 
They are supposed to provide insurance against default to bondholders . 
But , because they are freely tradable , they can be used to mount bear raids - a type of stock market strategy by which a trader ( or group of traders ) attempts to force down the price of a stock to cover a short position . 
In addition to insurance , they also provide a license to kill . 
Their use ought to be confined to those who have an insurable interest in the bonds of a country or company . 
It will be the task of regulators to understand derivatives and synthetic securities , and to refuse to allow their creation if they cannot fully evaluate the systemic risks . 
That task cannot be left to investors , contrary to the diktats of the market fundamentalist dogma that prevailed until recently . 
Derivatives traded on exchanges should be registered as a class . 
Tailor-made derivatives would have to be registered individually , with regulators obliged to understand the risks involved . 
Tailor-made products could be put together from exchange-traded instruments . 
Requiring derivatives and synthetic securities to be registered would be a simple and effective measure ; yet the legislation currently under consideration in the US contains no such requirement . 
The Senate Agriculture Committee proposes blocking deposit-taking banks from making markets in swaps . 
This is an excellent proposal that would go a long way in reducing the interconnectedness of markets , thereby preventing financial contagion , but it would not regulate derivatives . 
Moreover , the five big banks that serve as market makers and account for more than 95 % of over-the-counter transactions in the US are likely to oppose the proposal , because it would hit their profits . 
It is more puzzling that some multinational corporations are also opposed . 
The only plausible explanation is that tailor-made derivatives can facilitate tax avoidance and manipulation of earnings . 
Of course , these considerations ought not to influence the legislation .
