Should Germany Exit the Euro ? 
MUNICH - Last summer , the financier George Soros urged Germany to agree to the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism , calling on the country to &quot; lead or leave . &quot; 
Now he says that Germany should exit the euro if it continues to block the introduction of Eurobonds . 
Soros is playing with fire . 
Leaving the eurozone is precisely what the newly founded &quot; Alternative for Germany &quot; party , which draws support from a wide swath of society , is demanding . 
Crunch time is fast approaching . 
Cyprus is almost out of the euro , its banks &quot; collapse having been delayed by the European Central Bank &apos;s provision of Emergency Liquidity Assistance , while euroskeptic parties led by Beppe Grillo and Silvio Berlusconi garnered a combined total of 55 % of the popular vote in the latest Italian general election . 
Moreover , the Greeks and Spaniards are unlikely to be able to bear the strain of economic austerity much longer , with youth unemployment inching toward 60 % . 
The independence movement in Catalonia has gathered so much momentum that a leading Spanish general has vowed to send troops into Barcelona should the province hold a referendum on secession . 
France , too , has competitiveness problems , and is unable to meet its commitments under the European Union &apos;s Fiscal Compact . 
Portugal needs a new rescue program , and Slovenia could soon be asking for a rescue as well . 
Many investors echo Soros . 
They want to cut and run - to unload their toxic paper onto intergovernmental rescuers , who should pay for it with the proceeds of Eurobond sales , and put their money in safer havens . 
The public already is being misused in an effort to mop up junk securities and support feeble banks , with taxpayer-funded institutions such as the ECB and the bailout programs having by now provided â‚¬ 1.2 trillion ( $ 1.6 trillion ) in international credit . 
If Soros were right , and Germany had to choose between Eurobonds and the euro , many Germans would surely prefer to leave the euro . 
The new German political party would attract much more support , and sentiment might shift . 
The euro itself would be finished ; after all , its primary task was to break the Bundesbank &apos;s dominance in monetary policy . 
But Soros is wrong . 
For starters , there is no legal basis for his demand . 
Article 125 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union expressly forbids the mutualization of debt . 
Worst of all , Soros does not recognize the real nature of the eurozone &apos;s problems . 
The ongoing financial crisis is merely a symptom of the monetary union &apos;s underlying malady : its southern members &quot; loss of competitiveness . 
The euro gave these countries access to cheap credit , which was used to finance wage increases that were not underpinned by productivity gains . 
This led to a price explosion and massive external deficits . 
Maintaining these countries &quot; excessive prices and nominal incomes with artificially cheap credit guaranteed by other countries would only make the loss of competitiveness permanent . 
The entrenchment of debtor-creditor relationships between the states of the eurozone would fuel political tension - as occurred in the United States in its first decades . 
In order to regain competitiveness , the southern countries will have to reduce their goods prices , while the northern countries will have to accept higher inflation . 
Eurobonds , however , would impede precisely this outcome , because relative prices in the north can be raised only when northern savers invest their capital at home instead of seeing it publicly escorted to the south by taxpayer-financed credit guarantees . 
According to a study by Goldman Sachs , countries like Greece , Portugal , and Spain will have to become 20-30 % cheaper , and German prices will have to rise by 20 % relative to the eurozone average . 
To be sure , if Germany were to leave the common currency , the road back to competitiveness would be easier for the southern countries , since the rump euro would undergo devaluation ; but the crisis countries &quot; fundamental problem would remain as long as the other competitive countries remain in the eurozone . 
Spain , for example , would still have to cut its prices by 22-24 % relative to the new eurozone average . 
From this perspective , the crisis countries would not be spared painful retrenchment as long as they remained in a monetary union that includes competitive countries . 
The only way to avoid it would be for them to exit the euro and devalue their new currencies . 
Politically , it would be a big mistake for Germany to exit the euro , because that would reinstate the Rhine as the border between France and Germany . 
Franco-German reconciliation , the greatest success of the postwar period in Europe , would be in jeopardy . 
Thus , the only remaining option , as unpleasant as it may be for some countries , is to tighten budget constraints in the eurozone . 
After years of easy money , a way back to reality must be found . 
If a country is bankrupt , it must let its creditors know that it cannot repay its debts .
