Five Reasons Why the Sky Is Not Falling 
BUDAPEST - When it comes to geopolitics , there is always a market for gloom . 
Business has been booming in this respect lately , with The Economist , Foreign Affairs , and many less exalted journals full of claims that the global order is crumbling , America &apos;s ability ( and willingness ) to save it is in terminal decline , and the prospect of avoiding major conflict in the decade ahead is illusory . 
Plenty of recent events - along with the ghosts of 1914 and 1939 - have boosted the reputations , royalties , and revenues of today &apos;s doomsayers . 
There is Russia &apos;s adventurism in Ukraine ; 
But , though global political conditions are hardly as good as they could be - they never are - there are plenty of grounds for thinking that they are not nearly as bad as so many are claiming . 
Here are the five most important reasons not to lose as much sleep as some pundits say you should . 
First , Cold War II is not at hand . 
Russia and China dislike the United States &quot; claim to global leadership , enjoy tweaking its tail whenever they can , want greater regional influence , and ( like the US itself ) periodically turn their back on cooperative multilateralism . 
But they are deeply integrated into the existing global order , and have neither the ideological drive , economic interest , physical capacity , nor allied support to challenge it . 
They want greater influence in international institutions , not to overturn them . 
Second , the decline in US power and influence relative to China and other rising powers is natural , inevitable , and not a cause for alarm among those long reliant on America &apos;s protection and support . 
It is inconceivable that the US could have maintained forever the unipolar dominance of the early post-Cold War years , when it accounted for close to 30 % of global GDP and half of the world &apos;s military expenditure . 
Others were bound to play catch-up . 
The reality is that , in absolute terms , US economic and military power is still enormous , and that it has - and will have for the foreseeable future - far more allies , friends , and influence than any of its competitors . 
What matters is how it now chooses to exercise that power . 
As I heard Bill Clinton say privately , shortly after his presidency , that choice should not be &quot; to try to stay top dog on the global block in perpetuity , but to create a world in which we are comfortable living when we are no longer top dog on the global block . &quot; 
Third , while rising powers &quot; ambition for more space and influence is a given , it is not remotely inevitable that this quest must take a military form . 
Everyone has too much to lose . 
The world &apos;s major powers are far more interdependent financially and in terms of supply chains than they were in 1914 - the year of misguided optimism that pessimists love to cite - and the cumulative horrors of the twentieth century have fundamentally changed the normative environment . 
Bellicisme - the notion that war is noble , and can be purifying and cleansing - is dead beyond redemption . 
Fourth , the decline of reliance on military power to solve geopolitical problems is not a sign that wimps are in charge , but that adults are . 
US credibility is not at risk , for either its allies or foes , when it makes carefully calibrated choices about the balance of risk and return in using such force in particular cases . 
The recurring criticism directed at President Barack Obama for not following through on his threat to attack Syria if it used chemical weapons completely misses the point . 
The object was to stop these weapons from being used by the Assad regime , and diplomacy - backed by the threat of force - appears to have achieved just that ( although there have been recent reports , unconfirmed but worrying , of both rebel use and regime backsliding ) . 
Of course military force needs to be kept in the toolbox , to respond to states that wage aggressive war , like Iraq in 1991 . 
Military capability is also needed to meet the global responsibility to protect citizens at risk of genocide and other mass-atrocity crimes if no lesser option is available and if intervening will do more good than harm , as would have been the case in Rwanda in 1994 . 
But if the cowboy days of George W. Bush are over , that is to be applauded , not lamented . 
Fifth , the international system has been responding to geopolitical challenges more effectively than is generally acknowledged . 
Despite the meltdown in their relationship over Crimea , the US and Russia have continued to work together to negotiate a diplomatic solution to the Iran nuclear issue , and ( with China ) develop collective Security Council responses to successive crises in Africa . 
In almost every area of major power rivalry , potentially volatile issues are compartmentalized , while cooperation elsewhere continues . 
No policymaker can be complacent . 
There is no end in sight to the Syrian nightmare , the respite in eastern Ukraine may be proving temporary , and in Sino-Japanese relations cool heads remain in short supply . 
Nor is there any shortage of other issues and systemic improvements , not least nuclear-arms reduction , on which to work . 
But alarmist pessimism is self-reinforcing , defeatist , and needs to be contested . 
There is plenty of reason to believe that , where it matters most , we have learned enormously from the mistakes of the past . 
If we can stay calm and levelheaded , the worst of them will not be repeated .
