A Man against the Machine 
WASHINGTON , DC Â­ - America &apos;s financial sector has shown renewed strength in recent months - political strength , that is - by undermining most of the sensible proposals for banking reform that remain on the table . 
If we are still making any progress at all , it is because of the noble efforts of a small number of United States senators . 
Most notable has been the work of Senator Ted Kaufman , a Democrat from Delaware ( yes , a pro-business state ) , who has pressed tirelessly to fix the most egregious problems in the US financial sector . 
Kaufman understands that successful reform requires three ingredients : arguments that persuade , the ability to bring colleagues along , and a good deal of luck in the form of events that highlight problems at just the right time . 
On two fronts , Kaufman has - against long odds - actually managed to make substantial steps . 
Long before it became fashionable , Kaufman persisted with the idea that the US real estate boom was fueled in part by pervasive fraud within the mortgage-securitization-derivatives complex , effectively at the heart of Wall Street . 
This thesis is now gaining much broader traction - major newspapers now report a broadening criminal probe by the federal government - and by New York &apos;s state attorney general - into the US financial sector &apos;s residential lending and related securities practices . 
With Senators Patrick Leahy and Chuck Grassley , Kaufman worked last year to pass a bill providing timely resources to federal law enforcement agencies working on recent financial fraud . 
More recently , Kaufman was devastating in his cross-examination of Goldman Sachs executives . 
Senator Carl Levin , chairman of the subcommittee that heard their testimony , evidently seeing eye to eye with Kaufman , was just as tough after a year-long investigation of Washington Mutual , Goldman , and the abject failures of bank regulators and credit rating agencies . 
Kaufman scored an even bigger coup with his warnings about the dangers of the explosive growth of high-frequency trading , which is little understood by America &apos;s main financial watchdog , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , and poses systemic market risk . 
His concerns appear to have been vindicated by the 20-minute shutdown of trading in New York on May 6 , when the stock market completely failed in its most basic function : price discovery between buyers and sellers . 
We do not yet know what combination of black-box computer programs and electronic trading algorithms , interacting across more than 50 market centers , caused this catastrophe . 
But our lack of knowledge itself confirms how far our regulatory and surveillance capabilities have fallen behind &quot; financial innovation . &quot; 
Kaufman &apos;s approach - with speeches on the Senate floor as a central feature - seemed irrelevant or even quaint to critics even a few weeks ago . 
No significant Wall Street voices acknowledged his concerns - preferring instead to praise the equity markets as a shining example of well-functioning technology . 
Now people get it . 
As Senator Mark Warner graciously acknowledged , &quot; The Senator from Delaware sounded an early warning signal that the massive amounts of investments that had been made by certain firms to try to get what appears to be a fractional millisecond advantage in the trading process might come back and haunt us all ... 
I &apos;ve been proud to follow his lead . &quot; 
The SEC was once a great and powerful independent agency . 
Yet it still does not routinely collect the data that it needs - trades by time and customer - to understand the actions and impact of large traders . 
Kaufman has consistently pressed them to do more - and do it much faster ; to be sure , they and many others are now listening . 
On a third issue , the results so far are mixed . 
Kaufman championed the case for making America &apos;s biggest banks smaller , as part of comprehensive financial-reform efforts . 
His advocacy helped build support and forced a Senate floor vote on an amendment , co-sponsored with Senator Sherrod Brown , that would have imposed a hard cap on banks &quot; size and leverage ( debt relative to assets ) . 
The amendment was moderate and entirely reasonable , yet it went down to defeat , 33-61 , also on May 6 . 
It might have gained more support just a few days later - after senators witnessed the bailout of the giant eurozone banks . 
Still , it has strengthened backing for another amendment , sponsored by Senators Jeff Merkley and Carl Levin , which would restrict proprietary trading by megabanks for their own account - coincidentally a practice that is presumed to be a large and &quot; dark &quot; part of high-speed trading . 
The deeper and overriding point of Kaufman &apos;s critique of our system is the need for tough laws . 
We cannot merely rely on regulators to do the right thing . 
In particular , regulators have no chance to look over the horizon and act preventively when markets are opaque , and when powerful Wall Street interests ( and their Capitol Hill allies ) can circle the wagons and claim that there is no problem . 
Unfortunately , despite his newfound prominence on the national stage , Kaufman will be out of office at the end of this year - he was appointed to fill Vice President Joe Biden &apos;s seat at the end of 2008 and committed at that time not to run for re-election . 
When he goes , dangerous elements on Wall Street will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief . 
Let &apos;s hope that by then he will have helped move the consensus permanently among his colleagues - preparing the ground for further congressional action aimed at a serious tightening of safeguards over the financial sector . 
Kaufman &apos;s lasting legacy will be a simple and powerful idea that reasonable people increasingly find to be self-evident : relying on deregulation and self-interest in today &apos;s complex , opaque markets will manifestly fail to produce a reasonable allocation of capital or support entrepreneurship and growth . 
We must write and enforce laws that restore credibility to our financial markets .
