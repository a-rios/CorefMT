The Eurozone &apos;s False Recovery 
LONDON - At first glance , the eurozone economy seems like it might finally be on the mend . 
Stock markets are rallying . 
Consumer confidence has picked up . 
Lower oil prices , a cheaper euro , and quantitative easing by the European Central Bank are all expected to boost growth . 
ECB President Mario Draghi claims that &quot; a sustained recovery is taking hold , &quot; while policymakers in Berlin and Brussels latch onto signs of life in Spain and Ireland as proof that their bitter prescription of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms worked as advertised . 
On closer inspection , however , it becomes clear that the improvement is modest , probably temporary , and not the result of the policies promoted by Germany . 
True , according to some estimates , the eurozone economy may now be growing at an annual rate of 1.6 % , up from 0.9 % in the year to the fourth quarter of 2014 . 
With the eurozone economy 2 % smaller than it was seven years ago , &quot; recovery &quot; does not feel like the right word - especially as the relief is unlikely to last . 
For starters , the one-off boost from lower oil prices is already being unwound . 
After dropping by more than half between mid-June and mid-January , oil prices in euros have since bounced back by a third , partly owing to the euro &apos;s sharp depreciation , which is making imports generally more expensive . 
The effect of that on households &quot; budgets and companies &quot; costs is hardly cause for celebration . 
Policymakers are counting on a more competitive currency to stimulate growth . 
With eurozone exports increasingly reliant on global supply chains , a cheaper currency provides less of a boost than before . 
Exporters may also choose to pocket any gains , rather than seek to expand market share . 
In 2014 , exports from the eurozone amounted to nearly € 2 trillion ( $ 2.6 trillion at the time ) - more than those from China . 
Given patchy global demand , rapid export growth will be difficult to achieve . 
In any case , with exports accounting for only one-fifth of the eurozone &apos;s € 10 trillion economy , they are unlikely to spur a strong recovery while domestic demand remains weak . 
According to the ECB &apos;s model , the euro &apos;s 10 % depreciation over the past year ( in real , trade-weighted terms ) may lift growth this year by a mere 0.2 % . 
The benefits of quantitative easing are also likely to prove ephemeral . 
The decline in governments &quot; borrowing costs is unlikely to boost growth much , as European Union rules preclude fiscal expansion . 
Overall , the eurozone &apos;s fiscal stance is set to be broadly neutral this year , according to the European Commission , albeit with further squeezes in Ireland , France , and Italy . 
Quantitative easing does improve funding conditions for the few eurozone companies large enough to tap capital markets . 
On the contrary , investment in a weak real economy has been far less attractive than the prospect of earning easy money from financial engineering . 
Most businesses in the eurozone rely on bank finance , and while credit conditions have improved somewhat , lending is flat ( and continues to fall in southern Europe ) . 
As long as zombie banks are weighed down with bad loans , that is unlikely to change much . 
Nor can the small uptick in the eurozone &apos;s growth , much less the relatively rapid expansion in Spain and Ireland , be attributed to the German recipe of fiscal consolidation and measures to increase export competitiveness . 
Indeed , nothing could be further from the truth . 
Spain is hardly an example of a successful fiscal adjustment . 
Even so , its economy remains 5.7 % smaller than it was seven years ago . 
A whopping 23.7 % of Spaniards - and one in two young people - are unemployed , while many more have dropped out of the labor force altogether . 
Meanwhile , Spain &apos;s budget deficit was 5.7 % of GDP last year , the highest in the EU . 
Its rapidly rising public debt is set to top 100 % of GDP this year . 
As the country heads toward an election later this year , the European Commission has sanctioned the widening of its structural deficit . 
Rather than flourishing as a result of austerity , Spain is in many ways getting a free pass . 
Nor does Ireland - the fastest-growing EU economy last year - confirm the appropriateness of Germany &apos;s policy prescriptions . 
Ireland , after all , is a tiny , highly open economy whose booming export sector is benefiting from existing strengths - including low business taxes , a skilled workforce , and a flexible economy - and favorable external conditions , especially the strong recovery in its main markets , the US and Britain . 
Even so , the economy is smaller than it was before the crisis , the unemployment rate is in double digits , domestic demand remains depressed , and the € 64 billion bank-bailout bill unjustly imposed on 2.2 million Irish taxpayers still looms large . 
The eurozone economy is set to do a bit better in 2015 , but not because of the policies demanded by Germany . 
To overcome its balance-sheet recession , the eurozone needs to clean up its banks , reduce the crushing overhang of mostly private debt , redress the huge shortfall in investment , eliminate barriers to enterprise , and tackle the deflationary drag of German mercantilism . 
And that is why the eurozone will not escape its problems anytime soon .
