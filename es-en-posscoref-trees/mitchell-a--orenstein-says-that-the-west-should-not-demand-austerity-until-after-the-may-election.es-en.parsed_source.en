Will the IMF Lose Ukraine ? 
BOSTON - An incumbent trying to win an election in a stagnating economy must stimulate growth . 
This is one the most basic principles of modern politics . 
And yet the West , which wants to help its allies in Ukraine &apos;s interim government win the general election on May 25 , seems to have forgotten it . 
Instead , plans are underway to impose on Ukraine the biggest austerity package Eastern Europe has ever seen . 
This is no way to win votes . 
After the Russian-imposed chaos , the International Monetary Fund is planning to inflict its own chaos on Ukraine . 
It is time to remind the IMF that political stability , not a controversial raft of emergency reforms , must be the top priority . 
The IMF has long sought to impose a range of economic &quot; reforms &quot; on Ukraine . 
Some are reasonable ; others are not - and the IMF &apos;s track record in Ukraine is weak . 
Some of the reforms the IMF previously tried to get Ukraine to adopt , like pension privatization , were tried in other countries and ditched . 
The IMF does not always get it right . 
Today , its main blind spot in Ukraine has concerned consumer subsidies and transfer payments . 
It is true that Ukrainian households need to be weaned off absurdly large energy subsidies , which amounted to 7.5 % of GDP in 2012 . 
But , in a cold country where most of the population needs heating subsidies to survive and massive investments are required to increase energy efficiency , abruptly withdrawing support to households is politically unfeasible . 
No government that cuts heating subsidies suddenly will survive . 
The subsidies must be phased out and compensated by targeted cash benefits - the Ukrainian government estimates that it will cost â‚¬ 100 billion ( $ 139 billion ) to fix its energy policy - and these reforms need to be enacted after the upcoming election . 
In addition , one-third of official income in Ukraine comes from government &quot; transfer &quot; payments of various sorts , but mainly pensions paid to elderly women , given that the country &apos;s men rarely live much beyond the official retirement age . 
These women often use their pensions to subsidize their children and grandchildren . 
Yet cutting them ahead of the election - or announcing sharp cuts - is exactly what the IMF wants and what the interim Ukrainian government plans to do ; in the words of Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk , &quot; We don &apos;t have any other options . &quot; 
Yatsenyuk may be willing to sign away his political future , but the West should not let him do it . 
Not now . 
The IMF and Western governments need to give Ukraine some breathing room . 
Ukraine &apos;s economy was growing rapidly in the years before the global financial crisis , driven by exports of basic industrial goods , such as steel . 
The international financial institutions should then turn their attention to crafting an aid package that does not require the budget to be balanced on the backs of the poor . 
Instead of cutting consumer subsidies , the IMF could help Ukraine to improve tax collection . 
Oligarchs can be asked to contribute to any program as a condition of support for their regions or industries . 
And the IMF can come up with clever ways to encourage energy efficiency , for example , by designing a tax credit for households that purchase high-quality heaters . 
No successful Eastern European government has been asked to impose a dramatic austerity and reform program prior to democratic elections ; it would be utter folly to start now . 
In Poland , the region &apos;s star reformer , and elsewhere in post-communist Europe , citizens were asked to make the sacrifices that economic reform requires only after the government had gained a popular mandate . 
Ukraine is still a step away from this politically . 
If the IMF insists that the interim Ukrainian government impose austerity immediately , the country will be forced to break uncertain new ground at a particularly dangerous time . 
In short , the Western strategy for Ukraine should be to stimulate the Ukrainian economy until the May election and then negotiate a package of reforms with the government that emerges . 
Emergency economic reforms can wait two months ;
