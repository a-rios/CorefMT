Pakistan \ u0027s War of All Against All 
The alliance in the fight against terrorism between Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf and the United States is imperative not only for America , but for Pakistan-a Muslim-majority nation whose social fabric is being torn apart by militancy and lawlessness . 
But will an exclusive focus on military power ultimately prove to be counter-productive ? 
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , perhaps the country &apos;s most credible human rights body , argues that while &quot; the violence now deeply embedded in society is to be rooted out over the coming years , &quot; that task &quot; presents bigger challenges than merely picking up , detaining , and torturing those who authorities claim are militants . &quot; 
In opposing how the war against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban is fought , many in Pakistan &apos;s minuscule middle class find themselves aligned with people they abhor : extremists whose distorted religiosity violates the tolerant version of Islam prevalent in this region . 
Many upwardly mobile urbanites thus find themselves caught on the horns of a dilemma : how to reconcile aspirations for a better lifestyle , as symbolized by America , with increasing abhorrence of US policies . 
Those on the religious right have no dilemma : they just hate America and its policies outright , and oppose all things &quot; un-Islamic , &quot; including television , films , radio , and even indigenous forms of dance and music . 
Interestingly , computer technology is exempted , as it can be used to further the extremist cause . 
However , while Pakistan &apos;s progressives oppose militarism and violence in principle , religious fundamentalists have no compunction in resorting to violence to reinforce their point of view - thus posing a threat not just to General Musharraf , who has survived at least two assassination attempts , but also to human rights workers . 
Indeed , the prominent feminist lawyer Asma Jahangir has 24-hour armed guards . 
Militants have also attacked non-governmental organizations , particularly those located in the undeveloped tribal Northern Areas that lie beyond the writ of Pakistani law . 
Sharing a mountainous - and porous - border with Afghanistan , this region includes many Taliban sympathizers among their fellow Pashtuns . 
Human rights groups have long urged the necessity of extending the writ of Pakistan &apos;s Constitution to the tribal belt , where religion-based parties have wide support . 
These religious parties , a coalition of which now heads the provincial government in the North West Frontier Province , were politically marginalized until given a central role by Pakistan &apos;s military dictator of the 1980 &apos;s , General Zia ul Haq , who led Pakistan &apos;s covert intervention in the war against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan . 
Throughout his rule , religion-based politics grew along with the number of madrassahs and fighters trained and equipped by Pakistani and US intelligence agencies . 
The terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and subsequent pressure from Washington , led to a U-turn by Pakistan away from pro-jihadi policies . 
Today , many former officials associated with those policies , such as Mushahid Hussain , a former information minister , concede that Pakistan should have contained militancy long ago . 
Cautious steps are being taken , like the review of religion-based laws and curricula that have contributed to a creeping talibanization of Pakistani society . 
For human rights activists , it is ironic that an elected ( but basically military-led ) government that they oppose in principle should be undertaking reforms they have long advocated , but that elected civilian governments ignored . 
Despite fierce opposition from religious parties , there have been minor victories , like a couple of madrassahs agreeing to include secular subjects like math , English , and computer studies in their curricula . 
There has also been administrative action against a few religious institutions for encroaching on public space - practically unheard of since official patronage of religious parties began in the 1970 &apos;s , when their cadres were needed in the war against the Soviets . 
But the &quot; war on terror &quot; has also provided this government with an excuse to arrest and detain suspects without charge . 
More heinous human rights violations have also come to light . 
Qari Noor Mohammad , a religious activist in Faisalabad in Punjab province , was arrested recently and held without charge for several days before his corpse was dumped in front of his house . 
The lack of transparency that surrounds Pakistan &apos;s fight against &quot; terrorism &quot; is contributing to a growing public sentiment against the anti-militancy drive , which is largely perceived to be taking place under US pressure . 
Particularly contentious is the ongoing military operation in Wana district in the Northern Areas , which the Pakistani army has entered for the first time ever . 
The army action in Wana , aimed against Al Qaeda and Taliban operatives who are believed to be hiding there , has led to several civilian casualties , including women and children , and rendered over 30,000 people homeless . 
But human rights groups question how the five to six hundred Al-Qaeda operatives that the government claims were holed up in the area came to be based there in the first place . 
Locals interviewed independently say that some of those captured are in fact innocent local people from Wana , not foreign militants . 
Compared to his military predecessor , Musharraf , who touts the catch-phrase of &quot; enlightened moderation , &quot; is conveniently progressive . 
Whereas the devoutly religious Zia was useful for boosting religious Islamic sentiments against the Soviets , Musharraf is needed nowadays to contain those very forces , which threaten not just global security but Pakistan itself . 
It remains to be seen , however , whether he will be progressive enough .
