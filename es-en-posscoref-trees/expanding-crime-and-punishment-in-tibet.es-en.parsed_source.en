Expanding Crime and Punishment in Tibet 
NEW YORK - China has been widely criticized for its harsh treatment of almost any form of political dissent in Tibet . 
In 2008 , for example , a Tibetan named Wangdu , an AIDS educator in Lhasa , received a life sentence for sending news about Tibetan protests to Tibetans abroad . 
The logic was clear : preserve what China &apos;s leaders call &quot; stability &quot; and &quot; harmony &quot; in order to maintain state power . 
But two recent events in Tibet , involving the trials of two leading Tibetans who had not attacked or criticized the state at all , do not follow this logic . 
In the first trial , on June 24 , Karma Samdrup , 42 , one of the wealthiest Tibetan businessmen in China , received a 15-year sentence from a court in Xinjiang for stealing antiques . 
Human rights groups suggested the charge was invented , because the police had dropped the case for lack of evidence when it was first investigated 12 years ago , and neither witnesses nor new evidence were produced in court . 
Despite a detailed critique of the prosecution &apos;s case by two Chinese defense lawyers , the sentence , which had been known privately among officials for several days , was confirmed . 
On July 3 , Karma &apos;s elder brother , Rinchen Samdrup , 46 , was tried on charges of &quot; endangering state security . &quot; 
His crime was failing to register a small environmental group run by him and his younger brother in their remote home village of Gonjo , in eastern Tibet . 
Having been found guilty  -  the conviction rate in China is around 98 % , and is even higher in Tibet , so the verdict was never in doubt - he was sentenced to five years in prison . 
The younger brother , Chime Namgyal , 38 , who is disabled , has been hospitalized since June 11 for serious injuries received whilst in custody . 
He did not even receive a trial , but was given a 21-month sentence by local officials for the same offense as Rinchen - endangering state security by unofficially organizing litter-collection , tree-planting , and nature patrols to stop the hunting of endangered species . 
Even in China , such activities are not usually considered threats to the state . 
These three cases are doubly inexplicable , because none of the three brothers has been accused of actually criticizing China , opposing the Communist Party , or even talking about politics . 
On the contrary , they have been hailed as ideal Tibetan citizens . 
Karma had founded and financed a leading Tibetan environmental organization in 2001 , and was named China &apos;s philanthropist of the year in 2006 by China Central Television ( for &quot; creating harmony between men and nature &quot; ) . 
Rinchen was well regarded , too . 
His group was awarded a major environmental prize from Ford Motor Company in 2006 , and in 2008 the Chinese government described him and his organization as &quot; an extremely beneficial supplement to the government &apos;s environmental protection work . &quot; 
This February , China &apos;s most important paper , the People &apos;s Daily , published a large photograph of him receiving the award , together with praise of his work . 
( The paper was apparently unaware that by then he had been in custody for five months . ) 
Indeed , a book praising the brothers for their work , Tianzhu ( &quot; Heavenly Beads &quot; ) , was published in China late last year , to wide acclaim . 
In June , for no apparent reason , the book was banned throughout the country , despite its lack of political content . 
So , why is China targeting Tibetans who have no connection with politics and are regarded as model citizens ? 
Part of the answer may lie with corrupt local officials . 
Rinchen and Chime had criticized a local police chief for hunting endangered animals . 
One of his superiors at the nearby prefectural headquarters in Chamdo is suspected of having decided to punish them , as well as two of their cousins , Sonam Choephel and Rinchen Dorje , who are also in custody in Tibet for vague or unspecified offenses . 
But local officials could not have arranged for Karma to be tried in far-away Xinjiang , let alone persuade the central government to ban the brothers &quot; innocuous book about their love of nature . 
Higher-level leaders may have taken up the case against Karma - persuading their counterparts in Xinjiang to resurrect the old antiques case - because he had used his connections in Beijing to complain about the treatment of his brothers by officials in Tibet . 
This theory has gained credence because the Communist Party &apos;s current leader in the Tibet Autonomous Region formerly held a powerful position in Xinjiang Province . 
If it is true , the case against Karma suggests that officials stationed in Tibetan areas may be gaining more power , able to reach out beyond their jurisdictions to pursue what appear to be little more than personal grievances . 
Nor are these the only cases . 
Dorje Tashi , the wealthy owner of the Yak , a leading tourist hotel in Lhasa , is also said to be languishing in prison on vague political charges . 
In Tibet , where for the last 30 years major Tibetan businessmen had been seen as natural allies of the state , such developments are unprecedented . 
China &apos;s central government has the power to rein in its local chieftains , so its failure to do so in Tibet is puzzling . 
If it continues to allow such cases to go forward , it risks losing even more credibility among those Tibetans who , like the three environmentalists , have tried to stay within the law and avoid politics . 
Other Tibetans may conclude that China &apos;s government has relegated governance of their region to local satraps who have their own interests to pursue . 
In an area full of suspicion and antagonism towards the state , expanding the targets of its political prosecutions from Tibetan protestors to environmentalists and from dissident monks to businessmen risks further undermining China &apos;s own objectives in its most troubled region .
