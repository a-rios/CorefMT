Time to Test Iran 
NEW YORK - Most of the debate about how to address Iran &apos;s efforts to develop nuclear-weapons capacity focuses on two options . 
The first is to rely on deterrence and live with an Iran that has a small nuclear arsenal or the ability to assemble one with little advance notice . 
The second is to launch a preventive military strike aimed at destroying critical parts of the Iranian program and setting back its progress by an estimated two or more years . 
But now a third option has emerged : negotiating a ceiling on the nuclear program that would not be too low for Iran &apos;s government and not too high for the United States , Israel , and the rest of the world . 
In fact , such an option has been around for years - and in several rounds of negotiations . 
What has changed , however , is the context . 
And changes in context can be critical ; indeed , what happens away from the negotiating table almost always determines the outcome of face-to-face talks . 
The single most important change in context is the rapidly deteriorating state of Iran &apos;s economy . 
The many financial and oil-related sanctions that have been implemented in recent months and years are starting to bite . 
They were designed not to impede Iran &apos;s nuclear program directly , but rather to increase the price that Iran &apos;s leaders must pay for pursuing their nuclear ambitions . 
The thinking ( or , more accurately , the hope ) was that Iran &apos;s leadership , if forced to choose between regime survival and nuclear weapons , would choose the former . 
This hypothesis may soon get a real-world test . 
Iran &apos;s currency , the rial , has fallen roughly 40 % in recent weeks , sharply increasing Iran &apos;s inflation rate and what Iranians must pay for imports and many staples . 
The result is the first signs of serious public discontent with the regime since the violent repression of the Green Movement in 2009 . 
Iran &apos;s merchant class , one of the pillars of the clerical establishment that has ruled the country since the 1979 revolution , is grumbling as well . 
Other factors also could give negotiations a real chance . 
Upheavals in the Arab world suggest that no regime in the Middle East is entrenched ; 
In his speech at the United Nations in late September , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu signaled a willingness to give sanctions more time , until at least the summer of 2013 . 
And there are signs that , regardless of who wins November &apos;s presidential election , the US might well undertake an armed strike , with potential destruction much greater than if Israel were to act alone . 
Again , the Iranians might see compromise as the lesser of the threats that it faces . 
Until now , negotiations have been desultory at best . 
The compromise that Iranian officials are suggesting is nowhere near what they would have to accept to avert military action and gain an easing of sanctions . 
But now is the time to present to Iran a comprehensive package - what it must do and what the reward would be if it agreed . 
It would also be essential to set a deadline for Iran to accept such an accord , lest it use further negotiations to buy time to improve its nuclear capabilities . 
The precise terms would have to be determined , but Iran would have to give up all of the uranium that it has enriched to 20 % and stop enriching to that level . 
It would also have to accept a ceiling on how much uranium it could possess or enrich at lower levels . 
Limits on the number of centrifuges and where they could be housed might also be necessary . 
Inspections would need to be frequent and intrusive to reassure the outside world of what Iran is doing - or , perhaps more to the point , what it is not doing . 
In return , Iran would receive substantial relief from the removal of those sanctions imposed in response to its nuclear program . 
Moreover , the offer &apos;s essential elements should be made public . 
That way , if the regime balked , it would have to explain to its own people why it was not prepared to abandon its nuclear-weapons program , despite a reasonable US proposal that was not designed to humiliate Iran , and that , if accepted , promised a major improvement in Iranian living standards . 
It is possible that the new economic and political context will lead Iran &apos;s rulers to accept what they have rebuffed until now . 
If , on the other hand , the regime remains determined to pursue its nuclear goals , regardless of cost , then we will know that there is no alternative to the first two options : attacking Iranian facilities or living with a nuclear-armed Iran . 
Both outcomes are potentially risky and costly , but the US public , in particular , should be made aware that it was Iran that rejected a reasonable alternative to war before one began . 
And , if push came to shove , it would be good for other governments to know that the US and / or Israel decided to attack only after offering Iran a face-saving way out . 
That would make it less difficult to keep economic pressure on Iran in the aftermath of any strike . 
Going public makes sense for another reason : Iran &apos;s people ought to know that any attack on the country was one that it had largely brought on itself . 
This realization might mute any &quot; rally around the flag &quot; reaction and thus not rule out regime change down the road . 
We tend to think of diplomacy as something carried out in secret ; sometimes , however , it is better to hide in plain sight . 
This is such a moment . 
But time is of the essence ; diplomacy needs to move faster if it is not to be overtaken by Iran &apos;s march to a nuclear weapon - and , with it , the march to conflict .
