In Defense of International Justice 
MEXICO CITY - Not long after I took office as Mexico &apos;s foreign minister in 2001 , a novel problem came across my desk . 
An Argentine naval officer who had resettled in Mexico under an assumed name was wanted by Spain on charges of genocide , torture , and terrorism . 
The officer , Ricardo Miguel Cavallo , was implicated in abuses committed in 1977 and 1978 at the notorious Naval Mechanics School in Buenos Aires . 
According to the Spanish indictment , Cavallo belonged to the operations unit of a group actively involved in kidnapping and torturing people whom the military regime perceived as leftist . 
The question before me was whether to extradite Cavallo to Spain , a third country , to face trial for human rights abuses committed in Argentina . 
Signing the papers would be groundbreaking , as it would signal for the first time that suspected rights abusers might face trial anywhere in the world if justice was not likely at home . 
For me , the decision was straightforward : the crimes demanded justice , and Cavallo was more likely to be held to account in Spain than in Argentina . 
Amnesty laws in Argentina at the time shielded him from prosecution . 
Since then , many inroads have been made to ensure that the world &apos;s most serious crimes no longer go unpunished . 
The International Criminal Court is up and running , and 107 states , including Mexico , have ratified the treaty establishing the court and acceded to its jurisdiction . 
National courts , such as those in Spain , play an increasingly strong role in combating impunity through the exercise of universal jurisdiction . 
The rise of these types of prosecutions has in turn motivated countries , including Argentina and Chile , to repeal their amnesty laws so that suspected war criminals can be prosecuted at home . 
The trials of Slobodan Milosevic and Charles Taylor have demonstrated that even heads of state are no longer safe from prosecution . 
The comfort level for perpetrators of these crimes is shrinking as the options for prosecution expand . 
Whether the progress in this battle against impunity continues or slides backwards is now in the hands of the United Nations Security Council . 
On July 14 , the ICC prosecutor , Argentine lawyer Luis Moreno Ocampo , announced that he was seeking an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for orchestrating the atrocities in Darfur . 
Immediately after the announcement , Sudan &apos;s government and its allies began a diplomatic campaign aimed at securing a Security Council deferral of the investigations for 12 months . 
They are attracting wider support than they should - in part because of fear of retaliation against UN peacekeepers and humanitarian workers . 
But the Security Council must be extremely cautious in considering any suspension of ICC proceedings . 
Such a decision would be a serious setback to the movement to end impunity for the most serious crimes . 
It would show that indicted warlords and dictators can avoid justice by holding the Security Council hostage to threats of more violence . 
Suspending the ICC &apos;s work in this way would undermine its potential for deterrence , one of the purposes for which it was established . Postponing the case against al-Bashir would seriously undercut the important principle - which has gradually been taking root worldwide - that no one is above the law . 
The Security Council &apos;s decision to refer the situation in Darfur to the ICC prosecutor in March 2005 was itself a major milestone in the battle against impunity . 
That decision demonstrated , for the first time , that there was an institution that could investigate and prosecute the most serious international crimes regardless of where they occur . 
Apart from being a victory for international justice , the referral was also a promise to victims of the horrific crimes in Darfur that the perpetrators of the crimes against them would one day be held accountable . 
For the Security Council to step back from that commitment would do more than abandon the victims in Darfur . 
It would be a major blow to those around the world who have struggled to put an end to impunity for perpetrators of humanity &apos;s most terrible crimes .
