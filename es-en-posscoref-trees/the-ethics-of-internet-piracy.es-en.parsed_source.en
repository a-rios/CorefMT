The Ethics of Internet Piracy 
PRINCETON - Last year , I told a colleague that I would include Internet ethics in a course that I was teaching . 
She suggested that I read a recently published anthology on computer ethics - and attached the entire volume to the email . 
Should I have refused to read a pirated book ? 
Was I receiving stolen goods , as advocates of stricter laws against Internet piracy claim ? 
If I steal someone &apos;s book the old-fashioned way , I have the book , and the original owner no longer does . 
I am better off , but she is worse off . 
When people use pirated books , the publisher and the author often are worse off - they lose earnings from selling the book . 
But , if my colleague had not sent me the book , I would have borrowed the copy in my university &apos;s library . 
I saved myself the time needed to do that , and it seems that no one was worse off . 
( Curiously , given the book &apos;s subject matter , it is not for sale in digital form ) . 
In fact , others benefited from my choice as well : the book remained on the library shelf , available to other users . 
On the other hand , if the book had not been on the shelf and those other users had asked library staff to recall or reserve it , the library might have noted the demand for the book and ordered a second copy . 
But there is only a small probability that my use of the book would have persuaded the library to buy another copy . 
And , in any case , we are now a long way from the standard cases of stealing . 
I asked the 300 students in my ethics class which of them had not downloaded something from the Internet , knowing or suspecting that they were violating copyright . 
Only five or six hands went up . 
Many of the rest thought that what they had done was wrong , but said that &quot; everyone does it . &quot; 
Others said that they would not have bought the music or book anyway , so they were not harming anyone . 
It did not seem that any of them were prepared to stop . 
The case for enforcing copyright laws was strengthened by the details that emerged following the arrest in New Zealand last month of Kim Dotcom ( born Kim Schmitz ) , founder of the Web site Megaupload ( now closed down by the FBI ) . 
Megaupload allowed its 180 million registered users to upload and download movies , television shows , and music , and some of the money earned by Dotcom ( from advertising and subscriptions ) was on display at his mansion near Auckland , where he kept his Rolls-Royce and other exotic cars . 
Dotcom &apos;s lawyer claims that Megaupload was merely providing storage for its subscribers &quot; files , and had no control over what they were storing . 
But Megaupload offered cash rewards to users who uploaded files that proved popular with other users . 
Last month , the United States considered legislation that aimed at stopping Internet piracy . 
The bills had been written at the urging of Hollywood studios and the publishing and recording industries , which claim that violations of copyright on the Internet cost the US 100,000 jobs . 
Opponents said the proposed law would reach far beyond sites like Megaupload , making Google and YouTube liable for copyright infringement - and allowing the government to block ( without court authorization ) access to Web sites that it deemed to be facilitating copyright infringement . 
For the moment , Internet activists , together with Google , Facebook , and other major online players , have carried the day , persuading the US Congress to shelve its anti-piracy legislation . 
But the fight will continue : last month , the European Union and 22 member states signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , which establishes international standards and a new organization to enforce intellectual-property rights . 
The agreement has already been signed by Australia , Canada , Japan , Morocco , New Zealand , Singapore , and the US . 
Now it must be ratified by , among others , the European Parliament . 
I am an author , as well as a reader . 
One marvel of the Internet is that some of my older works , long out of print , are now far more widely available than they ever were before - in pirated versions . 
Of course , I am more fortunate than many authors or creative artists , because my academic salary means that I am not forced to rely on royalties to feed my family . 
Nevertheless , it isn &apos;t hard to find better purposes for my royalty earnings than Kim Dotcom &apos;s environmentally damaging lifestyle . 
We need to find a way to maximize the truly amazing potential of the Internet , while properly rewarding creators . 
Australia , Canada , Israel , New Zealand , and many European countries now have a public lending right , designed to compensate authors and publishers for the loss of sales caused by the presence of their books in public libraries . 
We need something similar for the Internet . 
A user fee could pay for it , and , if the fee were low enough , the incentive to use pirated copies would diminish . 
Couple that with law enforcement against the mega-abusing Web sites , and the problem might be soluble . 
Otherwise , most creative people will need to earn a living doing something else , and we will all be the losers .
