Vladimir Putin , Part Two 
LONDON  -  
In the West , he is regarded as an &quot; authoritarian , &quot; an &quot; autocrat , &quot; even as a &quot; dictator &quot; while in Russia a huge majority regard him as the most &quot; democratic &quot; of leaders , on the grounds that he has done more than his predecessors to improve the lot of ordinary people . 
That conclusion stems from Putin &apos;s recent statement that he might become prime minister after relinquishing the presidency next May . 
Given this reality , what matters now is how this &quot; Putin system &quot; will work , which will depend on institutional frameworks and practices . 
At stake , both for Russia and the wider world , are stability and legitimacy , hence the prospects for steady political and economic modernization . Legitimacy and stability are inseparable in practice , because maintaining stability in the absence of legitimacy would ultimately require Tiananmen-style repression . 
But this can be ruled out in today &apos;s Russia , because the instruments to implement it - notably an army that would obey orders to mow people down in the streets - are lacking . 
Much opinion poll evidence shows that the presidency is the only institution that Russians accept as legitimate ( in contrast to the legislature and judiciary , which are perceived as corrupt and ineffective ) . 
This is not surprising , given the country &apos;s history and culture . 
More important is that an almost equally large majority values the power to hire and fire their czar - in free elections held at regular intervals in line with the constitution . 
In Russia &apos;s current political cycle , which will culminate in the presidential election of March 2008 , there will be no difficulty in meeting the main conditions of legitimacy : respecting the constitution &apos;s rules about regular free elections to the presidency . 
Given Putin &apos;s popularity , these rules present no threat to the ruling group &apos;s power . 
The voters will enthusiastically elect anyone who has Putin &apos;s blessing . 
But looking forward to the next political cycle in 2012 , or the one after that in 2016 , there is no guarantee that today &apos;s conditions will still apply . 
Invincible popularity can evaporate . 
Even in the rosiest economic scenario , expectations about rising living standards will outstrip reality , causing disenchantment . 
If , in the meantime , the political system has not acquired more institutional cushioning , and the presidency &apos;s unique legitimacy remains - like today - based merely on the public &apos;s approval of an incumbent surrounded by shady and bickering Kremlin factions , there would be a high risk of chronic destabilisation . 
In these circumstances , an isolated and increasingly unpopular regime might decide to cancel or rig the presidential election when it fell due . 
This is what happened in Ukraine in November 2004 , with revolutionary consequences . 
It would be rash to assume that the outcome in Russia would be as benign as Ukraine &apos;s &quot; Orange Revolution . &quot; 
Integrating the presidency into broader political structures and procedures - especially into party politics - would reduce this risk . 
A political party infused with a normal instinct for self-preservation would produce a fresh face to run in a proper presidential election , replacing an unpopular incumbent and his cronies . 
As it happens , Putin is now entrenching the already dominant United Russia party by his decision to head the party &apos;s candidate list in December &apos;s parliamentary election . 
Could Russia emulate Japan &apos;s post-war model , in which a single dominant party revives and modernizes the country ? 
Like all historical analogies , this one may prove flawed , but it is not absurd . 
Japan &apos;s 
While inferior to the open alternation of power between two or more political parties , the evolution of United Russia into something resembling the LDP would still leave Russia in a much better shape than a personal regime confined to the Kremlin . 
Despite Russia &apos;s history after 1917 , one dominant political party is preferable to none at all . 
Putin &apos;s recent public statements point to such a vision : a dominant center-right ruling party , with a ( non-communist ) social democratic alternative waiting in the wings to maintain stable government should the main party falter . 
As so often in politics , much will depend on how far Putin matches deeds to words after leaving the presidency . 
Should he choose to exercise his vast residual influence through United Russia ( with its inevitable majority in the newly elected parliament ) , we will know that he means what he says . 
If , by contrast , he leaves the presidency , gets himself appointed prime minister , and overhauls the constitution to shift powers from the former to the latter , we will know that he is going for a personal regime after all . 
Emasculating the elected presidency , which is Russia &apos;s sole source of political legitimacy , would pave the way to chaos . 
The habit of changing the rules to keep power would persist after the strongman eventually leaves the scene , but the superficial stability of his rule would not .
