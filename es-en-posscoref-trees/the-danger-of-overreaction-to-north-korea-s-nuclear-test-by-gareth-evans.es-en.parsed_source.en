Keeping Calm on North Korea 
CANBERRA - North Korea &apos;s latest nuclear test is bad news , both for Northeast Asia and for a world that needs to reduce its reliance on nuclear weapons . 
&quot; Keep Calm and Carry On &quot; - as the British government famously urged its citizens in 1939 - is advice that often lends itself to parody . 
But it is what needs to happen now . 
It walked away from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in 2003 ; resisted serious negotiations within the framework of the Six-Party Talks established that year by the United States , China , Russia , South Korea , and Japan ; tested nuclear explosive devices in 2006 and 2009 in breach of a global moratorium ; conducted a series of increasingly provocative missile tests ; ignored United Nations Security Council resolutions and sanctions ; sank a South Korean navy ship and shelled one of its islands in 2010 ; and maintained a steady flow of belligerent rhetoric . 
All of this has jarred regional nerves yet again , in South Korea and particularly in Japan . 
There is new talk about the resources that may need to be mobilized to counter what is perceived as an increasingly sophisticated threat . 
It is still not permissible in polite company to talk about these frontline states acquiring their own nuclear weapons . 
Nor has North Korea &apos;s behavior done anything to help the cause of global non-proliferation and disarmament . 
It has successfully thumbed its nose at international pressure , becoming a beacon to small , vulnerable , and badly behaved states whose leaders want to believe that nuclear weapons will buy them immunity from intervention , and that Iraq &apos;s and Libya &apos;s biggest mistake was to fail to acquire them . 
Major downsizing of the US nuclear arsenal , which President Barack Obama wants to achieve , will become politically more difficult . 
America &apos;s tentative steps toward reducing the role of nuclear weapons in its overall security strategy , including defending its regional allies , will be harder to implement . 
This will all translate , inevitably , into calls for more toughness toward North Korea - less diplomacy and more sanctions , punitive measures , and isolation . 
How can anyone talk about returning to talks , offering incentives , or normalizing relationships with a regime that is so demonstrably recalcitrant ? 
Shouldn &apos;t we fight fire with fire ? 
Less inevitably , but more alarmingly , there may now be greater tolerance for those who argue that a country has a right to defend itself against existential threats with equally threatening weapons , or that a world of multiple nuclear powers would be less , not more , dangerous -with threats deterred and risk effectively neutralized . 
Such responses would be serious overreactions . 
At a general level , Henry Kissinger , George Shultz , William Perry , and Sam Nunn were right to argue that , whatever the case might have been for nuclear weapons during the Cold War , a twenty-first-century world of multiple competing nuclear powers would be one of massively enhanced global risk . 
The core message of the NPT must continue to resonate : so long as anyone has nuclear weapons , others will want them ; so long as anyone has them , they are bound one day to be used , by accident or miscalculation , if not by design ; and any such use would be catastrophic not just for the states immediately affected , but for life on this planet . 
For that message to resonate , the major nuclear-armed states must not only remain committed to non-proliferation , but also get serious about disarmament . 
In the case of North Korea , the world must of course register its displeasure . 
There will , and should be , Security Council condemnation and measures taken to cause the regime , if not its long-suffering people , genuine pain . 
Before rushing to conclude that this is a regime with which no productive normalization and denuclearization talks will ever be possible , we need to revisit the record . 
World leaders signed the Agreed Framework with North Korea in 1994 ( I was engaged in the process as Australia &apos;s foreign minister ) , but we dragged our feet in building the nuclear reactors and delivering the heavy fuel oil promised , partly owing to a widespread belief that the regime &apos;s collapse was imminent . 
The diplomatic trajectory re-established a few years later was halted by George W. Bush &apos;s &quot; Axis of Evil &quot; declaration in 2002 . 
When a potential new deal was negotiated by the US State Department in 2005 , US Treasury officials slammed that window shut by warning the world &apos;s banks against conducting transactions with any North Korean entity . 
The &quot; Sunshine Policy , &quot; which for a decade sustained hope of North-South reconciliation , ended abruptly with President Lee Myung-bak &apos;s election in South Korea in 2008 . 
The North Koreans are erratic , unpleasant , irresponsible , and unhelpful . 
New administrations , free of their predecessors &quot; baggage , are in place in all of the relevant regional capitals . 
If they , the US , and Russia stay calm , place enough on the table , and demand the same from the other side , diplomacy might move forward , and the future might not be irredeemably bleak .
