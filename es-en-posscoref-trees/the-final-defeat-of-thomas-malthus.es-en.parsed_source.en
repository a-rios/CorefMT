The Final Defeat of Thomas Malthus ? 
The UN recently revised its population projections . 
Some 6.3 billion people now live on Earth . 
If fertility rates in relatively poor countries continue to follow the trends set by today &apos;s relatively rich countries , we are within shouting distance of the world &apos;s maximum population-9-10 billion-to be reached in 2050-2100 . 
But population may well decline thereafter . 
Literate , well-educated women with many social and economic options in today &apos;s rich countries have pulled fertility below the natural replacement rate . 
The problem is not that such women on average want fewer than two children ; in fact , on average they wish to have a bit more than two . 
But because many of them delay childbearing until their thirties , actual fertility falls short of what they desire . 
A world population that peaks at 9-10 billion is not one in which we have to worry about Parson Malthus , the English 19th century economist who prophesied a future in which people multiply faster than the resources needed to sustain them and hence starve to death by the millions . 
Indeed , it comes as somewhat of a shock to realize that the age of the population explosion may be coming to an end . 
Just thirty years ago , people like Stanford University &apos;s Paul Ehrlich were telling us that the Malthusian Angel of Death was at the door . 
They assured us that it was too late to stop the famines that would kill hundreds of millions in the Indian subcontinent , and that humanity &apos;s destiny in the 21st century was one of war and struggle for the resources to feed national populations an extra crust of bread . 
Today , however , the political flashpoint over food is not that there is too little , but that there is too much . 
Developing-country politicians and populations complain bitterly that the rich industrial countries are growing too much food . 
&quot; Exporting food is one of the few ways we can earn the foreign exchange we need to buy modern industrial technology , &quot; they say . 
&quot; But your agricultural subsidy programs block us from establishing any sort of comparative advantage in most agricultural products . 
You say free trade is good in those manufactures that you export-you say that enforcing property rights is critically important for your investors-but somehow you go deaf when the topic turns to a level playing field in agricultural trade ... &quot; 
They are right . 
Not every developing country can grow rich by making and exporting computer chips , or plastic toys , or bananas . 
Some need to export steel . 
Others will have to export furniture or textiles . 
Still others will have to export citrus , grains , processed foods , etc . 
Given the complexion of the US Democratic Party &apos;s key constituencies , this is not surprising . 
On the contrary , what is surprising is that President Clinton was so willing to swim against the tide generated by his own labor / protectionist base in 1993 and 1994 and establish NAFTA and the WTO . 
It is also very surprising that the post-2000 Republican administration of George W. Bush has been so hostile to freer trade . 
Indeed , Bush has backed several major anti-liberal initiatives : a steel tariff , the expansion of agricultural subsidies , and a declaration that FTAA &#91; Free Trade Agreement of the Americas &#93; negotiations cannot even consider the impact of US agricultural subsidy programs on trade . 
Blockages to world trade jeopardize global economic development . 
Technology transfer is incredibly difficult . 
It may well turn out that $ 4 worth of aid are a poor substitute for even $ 1 worth of exports , because there are few better schools in which to internalize the organizational forms and technologies built since the start of the Industrial Revolution than the school of exporting . 
If global development is at risk , then so is the final defeat of Malthus . 
If the poorest countries stay poor , their rates of population growth might fall much more slowly than the United Nations predicts . 
Falling birthrates depend on a rise in the status of women , confidence in public health , growing prosperity , and strong cultural cues to convince people that there are other , better indicators of success than a large family . 
The fact that most countries are completing the demographic transition does not guarantee that all will . 
Perhaps Malthus will rule again , in geographically small but densely populated and immensely poor parts of the globe . 
The world &apos;s high- and middle-income countries should not imagine that the relatively rich can fence themselves off indefinitely from poverty and misery in the poorest countries . 
Nationalism has long been a powerful cause of political violence . 
Nothing is more likely to strengthen nationalism and turn it to violence than a sense that one &apos;s own homeland is being exploited-kept poor and powerless-by other nations to satisfy their own selfish interests . 
The world today is too small for any of us to be able to afford for any corner of it to be left out of the conquest of Malthusianism .
