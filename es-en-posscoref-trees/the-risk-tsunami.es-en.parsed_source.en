The Risk Tsunami 
NEW YORK - It is time for the G-20 to take seriously its mandate to agree on steps to stabilize the global economy and launch it on a more sustainable pattern of growth . 
Instead , the G-20 is behaving like a debating society , with the cooperative approach that it fostered at the outset of the crisis devolving into an array of often-heedless unilateral actions by its members . 
Yet there are several significant risks to global economic stability and prosperity that must be addressed urgently . 
Ireland has thrown Europe into its second sovereign-debt crisis this year , and capital markets have become schizophrenic , with investment rushing back and forth across the Atlantic in response to contagion risk in Europe and quantitative easing in the United States . 
Meanwhile , capital is flooding into the higher-interest-rate emerging markets , causing inflationary pressures , driving up asset prices , and subjecting currencies to competitiveness-threatening appreciation - in short , distortions and policy headaches that require unconventional , defensive responses . 
Growth and employment forecasts in the advanced countries have been reduced - a delayed recognition of the reality of an extended and difficult recovery and a new post-crisis &quot; normal . &quot; 
With lower and more realistic growth forecasts , fiscal deficits in the short to medium term are viewed as more dangerous . 
In the US , a subset of policymakers believes that weakening growth and high unemployment require a policy response . 
With a cyclical mindset and fiscal space exhausted , a new round of quantitative easing ( QE2 ) might be defended as a strategy for mitigating the tail risk of another downturn in asset markets ( mainly housing ) and households &quot; balance sheets - and with it the possibility of a deflationary dynamic . 
Worryingly , QE2 appears to be viewed in the US as a growth strategy , which it isn &apos;t , unless one believes that low interest rates will reverse the private-sector deleveraging process , raise consumption , and lower savings - neither a likely nor a desirable scenario . 
It also assumes that addressing structural constraints on competitiveness can be deferred - perhaps permanently . 
The view from outside the US is that QE2 is either a mistake with negative external effects , or a policy with the clear but unannounced intention of devaluing the dollar - a move whose main negative competitive and growth effects would most likely be felt in Europe , not in China , India , and Brazil . 
Unilateral action in this and other dimensions has undercut the G-20 &quot; s mission of identifying and implementing mutually beneficial policies in a coordinated way . 
A minimal requirement for G-20 progress is that policies in emerging and advanced countries that have significant external effects are discussed and , if possible , agreed upon in advance . 
Apart from the need to deleverage for a few more years , the US economy faces longer-term problems with aggregate demand , employment , and income distribution that cannot be solved through consumption and investment alone . 
America needs to expand its share in external global demand , which requires public-sector investment , structural change , and improved competitiveness in the tradable sector . 
Meanwhile , Europe struggles to find a solution to its deficit and debt problems by treating them with short-term liquidity fixes whose purpose is to buy time for fiscal consolidation and , in the absence of the exchange-rate mechanism , some kind of deflationary process to restore external competitiveness . 
Success is by no means assured , and the most likely outcome is a sequence of contagion events and a broader loss of confidence in the euro . 
The core issue is burden-sharing across bondholders , citizens of the deficit countries , the EU , and , indeed , the rest of the world ( via the International Monetary Fund ) . 
The emerging-market economies are at risk as a result . 
They can sustain relatively high growth rates in the face of weak and lengthy recoveries in the advanced countries , but not if there is a major downturn in North America or Europe ( or both ) , a serious outbreak of protectionism , or instability in global financial markets . 
The major emerging economies also have growing systemic effects on growth and employment across a broad range of countries , including the advanced ones . 
The old asymmetries are fading away , and there are new distributional challenges at the core of global economy-policy coordination . 
For most of the postwar period , advanced countries grew by expanding the knowledge and technology base of their economies . 
In a rapidly opening global economy , emerging economies learned to access both technology and markets , thereby growing at unprecedented and accelerating rates . 
As global economic activity shifted and the structure of all economies evolved with it , the distributional effects were overwhelmingly benign . 
But that was not inevitable . 
It came out that way because , for most of the period , the advanced countries benefited from market-driven innovation , while the emerging economies imported knowledge , exported goods and services , and had limited systemic impact on advanced economies . 
That pattern is changing . 
Emerging economies &quot; scale is growing , and their positioning on the global value chain is shifting rapidly . 
Surveys of attitudes toward the evolving global economic system show a widening divergence among countries as well as subgroups within countries . 
These almost certainly reflect divergences in terms of that system &apos;s distributional impacts . 
Guiding global interdependence in a way that ameliorates negative distributional trends is possible , but it will require wisdom and insight . 
That challenge must be at the core of the G-20 &quot; s mission . 
To put it differently , recognizing our collective interest in the openness of the global economy is not sufficient . 
We need a pragmatic willingness to adapt incentives and outcomes to achieve distributional results that allow the major players , with their domestic political constraints , to keep the system open . 
The alternative will be unilateral measures aimed at achieving the same goals , but leading to outcomes that leave everyone worse off .
