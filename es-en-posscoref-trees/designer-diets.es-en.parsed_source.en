Designer Diets ? 
Throughout our lives , we are exposed to a complex mixture of food compounds . 
Intricate biochemical processes extract from food the energy and other useful components that enable us to grow and function . 
Many compounds , seemingly unimportant in the past , are now recognized as influencing our health . 
For example , lycopene from cooked tomato sauces may help prevent prostate cancer . 
Everyone , indeed , knows that food can have a positive or negative impact on health . 
Food may never cure any particular disease , but diets rich in fruits and vegetables , cereals and plant-sourced oils offer protection from many cancers , cardiovascular disease , and other illnesses associated with old age . 
The problem , for scientists and consumers alike , is that the benefits are not the same for everyone . 
So we need to understand how what we eat interacts with our bodies - or , more specifically , our genes - to affect our health . 
This is the science of nutrigenomics . 
The long-term aim of nutrigenomics is to define how the whole body responds to food using so called &quot; systems biology . &quot; 
Every cell in your body ( except mature red blood cells ) - there are about 50 trillion in an adult - contains copies of your DNA , which are coiled up tightly to form 46 separate bundles called chromosomes . 
These chromosomes are stored in the core of the cell ( nucleus ) , and there are 22 matching pairs , one of each pair from each of your biological parents , plus an X-chromosome from your mother and either an X- or Y-chromosome from your father ; 
XX makes you a girl and XY a boy . 
It consists of two strings - formed from phosphate and sugar - along which four unique chemical compounds ( DNA bases ) are attached . 
There are about three billion bases , and the sequences in which they occur is our genetic code , or human genome . 
Within the genetic code , there are 30,000-40,000 highly organized regions called genes . 
Genes are the basic unit of heredity , and , unless you are an identical twin , the combination of genes inherited from your parents is unique to you . 
The genes that you have make up your genotype . 
The resulting product , for example eye color , is your phenotype . 
Genotyping can be used to determine which genes you have , but it cannot always predict your phenotype . 
The inheritance of some characteristics , including eye color , is simple . 
The majority of phenotypes are , however , the product of complex multi-gene interaction , environment , and lifestyle choices . 
Genes code for proteins , the body &apos;s workers , which are not made directly from DNA , because they do not speak the same language . 
Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) acts as an interpreter in a process called transcription ( the reading of genes ) . 
Translation from RNA creates three-dimensional proteins from combinations of 22 essential amino acids - essential only because our bodies are not able to make them , so they must be obtained from our diet instead . 
The proteins that are produced , their quantities , and their characteristics collectively form the proteome , and their activities , in combination or in response to signals from within the body or external to it , form our metabolism . 
Such is the complexity of nutrigenomics that it is no longer possible for nutritional researchers to work alone . 
Expertise in a wide variety of different areas - molecular and cell biology , mathematics and statistics , nutrition and diet , food chemistry , and social science - is fundamental to progress . 
To this end , 22 leading groups have united to create The European Nutrigenomics Organization , or NuGO . 
Funded by the European Commission , NuGO gives scientists from organizations that usually compete for funding and the best researchers their first real opportunity to work together . 
Difficulties stemming from professional jargon , organizational structure , and distance are more than offset by the benefits of integrating nutrigenomics facilities and expertise to ensure cooperative use of knowledge and its application in nutritional research . 
Nutrigenomics is not the Holy Grail of nutrition , but neither is it irrelevant to all but the worried-but-wealthy few that will be able to afford the new food products when they arrive . 
Determining the structure of DNA and the sequence of the human genome has revolutionized biology and medicine . 
It has created new specialties and advanced our understanding of disease . 
But rarely does this knowledge allow us to control outcomes - prevention rather than cure . 
Indeed , in the twenty-first century , we still cannot describe health except in terms of the absence of disease . 
Today &apos;s new technologies enable health to be identified in terms of patterns of gene expression , protein production , and metabolic response . 
Applied to nutrition , nutrigenomics will allow us to understand , and perhaps more importantly , to manipulate our individual response to existing foods so as to benefit our health . 
For some people , this will mean expensive genetic testing and designer diets , but for most , it will mean realistic advice based on visibly demonstrable phenotypes - a tendency to gain weight , for example , or an intolerance or allergic response to certain food types . 
Above all , nutrigenomics holds out the promise of providing the healthy independence that everyone hopes for in later years .
