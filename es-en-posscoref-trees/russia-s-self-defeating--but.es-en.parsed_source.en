Russia &apos;s Self-Defeating &quot; But &quot; 
MOSCOW - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin insists that &quot; Without normal democratic development Russia will have no future . &quot; 
We Russians are pleased to hear these enlightened words , yet Putin adds a &quot; but &quot; to his argument , which weakens it considerably . 
In fact , Putin &apos;s &quot; but &quot; renders his points senseless . 
We have hated this &quot; but , &quot; this coordinating conjunction , ever since the dawn of the Soviet era . 
Then we were told that freedom is good , but that one can &apos;t live in an individualist society without common concern for the communist state . 
Democracy is great , but only in the interests of the working class . 
Now Russia &apos;s prime minister tells us that democracy is indeed great , but that public protests cannot take place in public places , say , around hospitals and the like . 
Never mind that the Russian constitution does not list hospitals among places forbidden for public assembly , or that sick people need democracy , too . 
Russian President Dmitri Medvedev does understand - with no &quot; buts &quot; - that &quot; freedom is better than not freedom , &quot; that &quot; legal nihilism &quot; is bad and democracy is good . 
He understands that Stalin was a criminal , that his order to murder Polish officers in Katyn was an act of depravity that has no excuse or explanation . 
The president understands this ; unfortunately , we don &apos;t understand the role our president plays in our society . 
He says all the right things , yet they don &apos;t seem to be reflected in reality . 
The Dissenters Marches , which take place on the 31st of every month ( article 31 of the Russian constitution guarantees freedom of assembly ) , could be ( and are ) easily dismissed as a marginal protest of a few hundred people with no common goals or ideas . 
Putin &apos;s and Medvedev &apos;s poll numbers are so high , many argue , that they don &apos;t need to care about a few dissenters . 
Besides , most Russians support the government with no dissent at all , they say . 
This doesn &apos;t say much , however , because the Russian majority always supports the government , regardless of the policies it implements . 
Today &apos;s dissenters are indeed a minority and of course can be disregarded , but only up to a point . 
After all , this minority is one of thinkers - musicians , artists , and writers , and those who move forward Russian science , technology , and economic innovation . 
Such people cannot be dismissed as useless , since we need the innovation that they deliver , even if we think Russia doesn &apos;t need democracy . 
True , not all members of the thinking minority attend the dissenters &quot; marches , yet many more of them silently oppose the regime . 
Our leaders talk obsessively of Russia &apos;s industrial modernization , of their support for innovations such as nanotechnology , so that Russia can catch up with the developed counties . 
In line with Soviet traditions , a nanotechnology project was given a piece of land , with plans to set up various scientific facilities . 
The best brains in Russia -engineers , scientists , and inventors - will gather in one place , and from there begin moving the country forward . 
The hope is that not only those living in Russia but also emigrants will be overcome with patriotic feelings . 
They will come back to Russia ( also drawn by high salaries ) to make themselves famous and their motherland proud . 
A wonderful plan . 
For example , imagine a genius who left Russia years back . 
He has achieved prominence in a foreign country , inventing something outstanding . 
Now he is asked to come home : your motherland is waiting for you , it values your contribution , it forgives your betrayal , and it will pay you more than what you are getting elsewhere . 
But this brilliant scientist is still a human being . 
He is of course nostalgic for the birch trees , his old friends , ex-wife , and children from the first marriage . 
He wants to come back , to revisit all that he has left behind , in the meantime helping his nation to become economically strong , technically advanced , and prosperous . 
Yet , before making the final decision , he turns on the radio , watches a bit of TV , browses the Internet , and finds out what Russia is like . 
Journalists are killed , scientists are accused of espionage , and Mikhail Khodorkovsky remains unjustly imprisoned . 
Various blogs tell him that Russia &apos;s parliament is just a place for rubber-stamping decisions already taken at the top . 
He reads the confused and confusing speeches our leaders : freedom is good , but ... 
This brilliant scientist learns that Vasily Aleksanyan , the terminally ill Yukos lawyer , was held in prison in inhuman conditions . 
Another lawyer , Sergei Magnitsky , died in prison after being refused medical treatment . 
And yet another one , Stanislav Markelov , was gunned down on a Moscow street . 
Then this scientist will be surprised ( or not ) to discover that the Russian majority views Joseph Stalin as the third most popular person in a contest to be known as the &quot; Face of Russia . &quot; 
In the meantime , his junior colleague in Russia , who still has his whole future in front of him , does not attend the Dissenters &quot; March , but simply emigrates , which is also a form of protest . 
In Soviet times , communist leaders tried to lure people into the kolkhozes ( collective farms ) with promises of great crops and spectacular meat production . 
Nothing worked , because the kolkhoz system was incompatible with high achievement in the long run . 
Similarly , in a country where the concepts of democracy and freedom are balanced by &quot; but , &quot; achievements in science , technology , and economy are not possible . 
The thinking minority needs a system of laws and institutions , real presidential elections , a working parliament , and justice that is independent , rather than merely following orders from above .
