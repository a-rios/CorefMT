America \ u0027s Problems Run Deeper than Wall Street 
CAMBRIDGE - With less than two months remaining before America &apos;s presidential election , much attention is focused on the state of the American economy and the challenges that it will present to the next president . 
We are in the midst of a financial crisis caused by the serious mispricing of all kinds of risks and by the collapse of the housing bubble that developed in the first half of this decade . 
What started as a problem with sub-prime mortgages has now spread to houses more generally , as well as to other asset classes . 
The housing problem is contributing to the financial crisis , which in turn is reducing the supply of credit needed to sustain economic activity . 
Indeed , the financial crisis has worsened in recent weeks , reflected in the US Federal Reserve &apos;s takeover of quasi-government mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - which may cost American taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars - as well as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch . 
Ultimately , these financial failures reflect the downward spiral of house prices and the increasing number of homes with negative equity , i.e. , with substantial mortgage debt in excess of market values . 
Negative equity is significant because mortgages in the United States are generally &quot; no recourse &quot; loans . 
If a homeowner defaults , creditors can take the house , but they cannot take other property or income to make up any unpaid balance . 
Even in those states where mortgages are not &quot; no recourse &quot; loans , creditors generally do not pursue the assets or income of individuals who default . 
We cannot be sure about how much further house prices will fall . 
Experts say another 15 % decline is required just to return to the pre-bubble price path . 
The growing gap between mortgage debts and house prices will continue to increase the rate of defaults . 
Many homeowners who can afford to make their mortgage payments will choose to default , move to rental housing , and wait to purchase until house prices have declined further . 
As homeowners with large negative equity default , the foreclosed homes contribute to the excess supply that drives prices down further . 
And the lower prices lead to more negative equity and therefore to more defaults and foreclosures . 
It is not clear what will stop this self-reinforcing process . 
Declining house prices are key to the financial crisis and the outlook for the economy , because mortgage-backed securities , and the derivatives based on them , are the primary assets that are weakening financial institutions . 
And that means that the financial institutions that own them cannot have confidence in the liquidity or solvency of potential counterparties - or even in the value of their own capital . 
Without this confidence , credit will not flow and economic activity will be constrained . 
Moreover , because financial institutions &quot; assets were bought mainly with borrowed money , the shortage of credit is exacerbated by their need to deleverage . 
Since raising capital is difficult and costly , they deleverage by lending less . 
But the macroeconomic weakness in the US now goes beyond the decreased supply of credit . Falling house prices reduce household wealth and therefore consumer spending . 
Falling employment lowers wage and salary incomes . 
The higher prices of food and energy depress real incomes further . 
And declining economic activity in the rest of the world is lowering demand for US exports . 
The US Federal Reserve has , in my judgment , responded appropriately by reducing the federal funds interest rate sharply and creating a variety of new credit facilities . 
The low interest rate helped by making the dollar more competitive , but otherwise monetary policy appears to have lost traction because of the condition of the housing sector and the dysfunctional state of the credit markets . 
The US Congress and the Bush administration enacted a $ 100 billion tax rebate in an attempt to stimulate consumer spending . 
Those of us who supported this policy generally knew that history and economic theory implied that such one-time fiscal transfers have little effect , but we thought that this time might be different . 
Our support was , in the words of Samuel Johnson , a triumph of hope over experience . 
In the end , our hopes were frustrated . 
The official national income accounting data for the second quarter are now available , and they show that the rebates did very little to stimulate spending . 
More than 80 % of the rebate dollars were saved or used to pay down debt . 
So that is where the US is now : in the middle of a financial crisis , with the economy sliding into recession , monetary policy already at maximum easing , and fiscal transfers impotent . 
That is an unenviable situation , to say the least , for any incoming president .
