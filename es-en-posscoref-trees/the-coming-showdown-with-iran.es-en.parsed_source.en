The Coming Showdown with Iran 
FLORENCE - US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration has lost little time in announcing that it will seek direct talks with the Iranian government . 
This means , at the very least , a tough confrontation over Iran &apos;s quest for a regional strategic advantage in the form of a nuclear weapon . 
There is more at stake here than coming up with the right set of incentives and threats to change the Iranians &quot; minds . Rather , the time has come to approach the nuclear question in its full regional context rather than piecemeal and operationally . 
The entire world knows the risk posed by a nuclear Iran : a drastically altered balance of power in the Middle East and Central Asia , with Iran able to exert far more regional leverage - both overt and implicit - than it now possesses in pursuit of its interests . 
Moreover , nearby states are likely to launch or further their own nuclear programs in response , leading to a protracted nuclear arms race in one of world &apos;s most volatile regions . 
It is not in the interest of the US or Europe for any of the states at the head of the list - Egypt , Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Syria , and Algeria - to have its own nuclear weapons capability . 
While neither outcome is certain , each remains likely . 
There is considerable domestic pressure in each of these countries - as there has been in Israel and Pakistan , currently the region &apos;s only nuclear states - to secure the presumed benefits in power and prestige of possessing nuclear weapons . 
Such pressure is magnified when rivals and neighbors are perceived to have any kind of strategic advantage . 
Yet each of the region &apos;s states has important security concerns and vulnerabilities . 
Iran , a multiethnic state whose rulers have struggled to advance national cohesion , is no different . 
Shi &apos;a nationalism has followed Persian chauvinism as a rallying point , but neither has succeeded fully in bolstering Iran &apos;s political institutions and securing the allegiance of its young population , nearly two-thirds of which is under the age of 30 . 
The nation &apos;s unity is periodically threatened by its clerical rulers &quot; unpopularity among large sections of the population , as well as by regional and ethnic divisions , conflict and instability in its immediate neighborhood , and the hostility engendered by its regional clients and / or proxies in Iraq , Lebanon , Afghanistan , and elsewhere . 
In theory , all of these factors are potential sources of leverage for outside powers like the US . 
But opposing Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions directly has had the opposite effect so far . 
Iran &apos;s quest for nuclear weapons - with its boost to national pride and promise of regional preeminence - has played a critical unifying role , as well as a political and military one . 
The challenge is to craft a consistent policy that both contains and deters Iran &apos;s ambitions without exacerbating its inherent sense of national vulnerability . 
The policy debate outside the region currently centers on whether to use force if talks fail . 
Iran , predictably , has refused to back down , which some observers have suggested reflects the failure of the world &apos;s major powers to speak with a unified voice . 
This is true , but it is an insufficient explanation . 
Others have claimed that Iran &apos;s leaders do not care one way or the other about world opinion . 
This , too , is an insufficient explanation , for no country , not even North Korea , lives in a vacuum . 
Formulating the right mix of carrots and sticks is extremely difficult , and the US is hardly seen in the region as an honest broker . 
Therefore , its focus should be less on calibrating tactics per se than on recasting the regional context in which Iran &apos;s leaders will determine whether to proceed or desist . 
The starting point should be further enhancement of conventional military forces throughout the region , which means more than increasing weapons inventories . 
There should be more confidence-building measures , including joint training exercises and information exchanges , among all the region &apos;s militaries . 
A major boost to confidence would be a clear-cut strategic commitment from the West in the form of an extension of NATO &apos;s own deterrent to the Middle East . 
It need not single out Iran , and would be more effective than a unilateral US guarantee to Israel or any other single state . 
Instead , NATO members should pledge to defend any Middle Eastern state that is attacked with nuclear weapons . 
Under ideal diplomatic circumstances , Russia and China would be persuaded to join with NATO in a joint declaration . 
Such steps alone are unlikely to deter Iran or fully to reassure the region &apos;s other states .
