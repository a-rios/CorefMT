Wasting Food in a Hungry World 
OTTAWA - One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year , owing to inefficient harvesting , inadequate storage , and wastage in the kitchen . 
Halve that waste , and the world could feed an extra billion people - and make hunger yesterday &apos;s problem . 
The extent of food loss is particularly galling in view of a new global study on food security from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization . 
According to the FAO , 57 developing countries have failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of hungry people by this year . 
One in every nine people on the planet - 795 million in all - still goes to sleep hungry . 
Of course , there has also been remarkable progress : over the last 25 years , the world has fed an extra two billion people , and - for all the 57 failures - the developing world as a whole has almost halved its hunger rate . 
One reason is that by then the world will have added another two billion mouths to feed ; a second reason will be the growing appetite of a surging new middle class . 
At the moment , the UN is considering 169 new development targets to succeed the Millennium Development Goals ( hunger is one target area , among many ) . 
These targets are vitally important , because they will determine how more than $ 2.5 trillion in development money is spent on everything from climate change to malaria . 
My think tank , the Copenhagen Consensus Center , therefore asked 60 teams of top economists to assess which proposed targets will do the most good - and which will not . 
Our research on food security shows that there are smart ways to feed many more on the planet - but they have little to do with the campaigns against waste seen in most of the rich world . 
In the rich world , the focus is on food wasted by the consumer . 
This makes sense : more than half of the rich world &apos;s losses take place in its kitchens ( basically because we can afford it ) . 
In Britain , for example , the greatest waste is in salads , vegetables , and fruits - luxuries when compared with the cheap calories contained in the grains and tubers consumed throughout the developing world . 
Smaller households in rich countries waste more per person , because it is harder to put everything to use , while richer households add waste when they can afford to buy extra &quot; just to be on the safe side . &quot; 
By contrast , the world &apos;s hungry poor waste very little , simply because they cannot afford to . 
In Africa , daily food waste averages 500 calories per person - but consumers account for only 5 % of this loss . 
More than three-quarters of the waste occurs well before the kitchen , in inefficient agriculture , because birds and rats eat crops during harvest , for example , or pests spoil grain stores . 
There are many remedies for this kind of waste - from the &quot; curing &quot; of roots and tubers to minimize damage , to more expensive refrigeration . 
So why aren &apos;t these technologies - widely used in richer countries - adopted in the developing world ? 
The answer is a lack of infrastructure . 
If there are no proper roads linking fields to markets , farmers cannot easily sell their surplus produce , which may then spoil before it can be eaten . 
Improving road and rail capacity enables farmers to reach buyers - and fertilizer and other agricultural inputs to reach farmers . 
Supplying reliable electricity permits grains to be dried and vegetables to be kept cool . 
Economists from the International Food Policy Research Institute estimate that the overall cost of approximately halving post-harvest losses in the developing world would be $ 239 billion over the next 15 years - and would generate benefits worth more than $ 3 trillion , or $ 13 of social benefits for every dollar spent . 
This would make food more affordable for the poor . 
By 2050 , better infrastructure could mean that 57 million people - more than the current population of South Africa - would no longer be at risk of hunger , and that about four million children would no longer suffer from malnutrition . 
Most of these gains would be in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia , the world &apos;s most deprived regions . 
But there is an even better investment . 
We can achieve three times the economic benefits , and even larger reductions in the number of people at risk of hunger , if we focus on improving food production rather than just on preventing food losses . 
Today , only $ 5 billion is spent annually on research to improve the seven major global food crops , and just one-tenth of that is targeted to help small farmers in Africa and Asia . 
Investing an extra $ 88 billion in agricultural research and development over the next 15 years would increase yields by an additional 0.4 % each year . 
That might not sound like very much , but the reduction in prices and improvements in food security would help almost everyone . 
It would be worth nearly $ 3 trillion in social good - yielding an enormous $ 34 of benefits for every dollar spent . 
Hunger is a complex problem , exacerbated by financial pressures , volatile commodity prices , natural disasters , and civil wars .
