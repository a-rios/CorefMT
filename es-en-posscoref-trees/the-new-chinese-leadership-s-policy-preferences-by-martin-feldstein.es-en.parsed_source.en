China &apos;s New Path 
CAMBRIDGE - The opaque nature of China &apos;s government makes it difficult to see where Chinese economic policy is heading , and thus how the Chinese economy will develop in the years ahead . 
But the scale of China &apos;s economy and its role in global trade and financial markets compel us to try to understand the intentions of China &apos;s new leadership . 
A useful starting point is to examine the key appointments that have been made since President Xi Jinping assumed office . 
One surprise was the decision to retain Zhou Xiaochuan as Governor of the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) . 
Zhou had come to the end of his term - and had reached an age at which officials are supposed to retire . 
So the decision to keep him on for at least the next two years represents a significant endorsement by the new Chinese leadership . 
Zhou is an intelligent and internationally respected expert on monetary policy and finance . 
As the head of the PBOC , he has favored more market-based monetary policies and increased internationalization of China &apos;s currency , the renminbi . 
He has also worked successfully to contain inflationary pressures . 
We can expect more of the same in the coming years . 
The new finance minister , Lou Jiwei , comes to the ministry from the China Investment Corporation , China &apos;s sovereign wealth fund , where he dealt with global capital markets on a daily basis . 
Lou , a trained economist who previously served in the Ministry of Finance as a deputy minister , where he was a voice for pro-market reforms , indicated his current approach to tax and budget policy at a recent meeting in Beijing . 
He rejected what he described as the European style of very large government and high tax rates and the American style of lower tax rates but large fiscal deficits , in favor of low budget deficits and a tax system that would promote &quot; opportunities &quot; for individuals and private enterprises . 
Xi and Premier Li Keqiang obviously knew what they were getting when they appointed Lou . 
And , despite his age , they promised that he would have a full five years as Finance Minister , which would push his tenure past the normal retirement age . 
Liu He is perhaps the least visible of the key economic thinkers . 
Liu played an important role in shaping the recently adopted 12th Five-Year Plan , with its emphasis on urbanization and service-sector development as a means to increase personal incomes and the share of consumer spending in GDP . 
He has recently been promoted to the post of Deputy Director of the National Development and Reform Commission , the principal body that advises the State Council on economic-development strategy and macroeconomic policy . 
Taken together , these appointments demonstrate the new Chinese leadership &apos;s emphasis on pro-market reforms and a shift from heavy industry to greater reliance on consumption and services . 
That shift is likely to mean a slower rate of GDP growth than the annual rate of nearly 10 % that China achieved during the last three decades . 
But a slowdown to 7 % annual growth would still double China &apos;s GDP over the next decade . 
More consumption and less heavy industry will also reduce China &apos;s demand for raw materials , dampening global commodity prices . 
Even more significant , shifting income from state-owned enterprises to middle-class workers and increasing consumer spending will reduce China &apos;s enormous saving rate . 
Since a country &apos;s current-account surplus is the difference between its national saving and its national investment , China &apos;s current-account surplus is likely to continue to shrink in the coming years . 
That is consistent with the Five-Year Plan &apos;s goal of basing GDP growth more on domestic demand and less on exports . 
Since China &apos;s external surplus is already down to less than 2 % of GDP , a decline in domestic saving could result in China beginning to run a current-account deficit . 
In that case , China would no longer be a net buyer of foreign bonds and other assets . 
If China wanted to continue to invest in foreign businesses and natural resources , it would have to become a net seller of bonds from its portfolio . 
The new leadership will , of course , face serious obstacles as it tries to shift policy in these market-friendly directions . 
China &apos;s state-owned enterprises are powerful forces in the economy , with substantial political influence ; they will resist the shift from heavy industry to services . 
Likewise , the widespread and official recognition of corruption introduces a new source of uncertainty into national and local politics . 
But China &apos;s new leaders have signaled where they want the economy to go and have emphasized their determination to reduce corruption . 
Most important , they have put talented people in charge of the process . 
The rest of the world should hope that they succeed .
