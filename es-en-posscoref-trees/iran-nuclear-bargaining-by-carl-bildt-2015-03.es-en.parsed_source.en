Grand Bargaining with Iran 
STOCKHOLM - Slowly but surely , Iran &apos;s talks with the international community about its nuclear program are approaching the make-or-break point . 
The rapprochement between Iran and its negotiating partners on the core nuclear issue is obvious . 
No one at this point seriously believes that Iran is maintaining an active program to develop nuclear weapons , though not long ago it was almost conventional wisdom that the country was close to having them . 
Now the focus is on ensuring that Iran would need a year or so to assemble a nuclear device if it ever decided to do so . 
If trust were to collapse , and the Iranian regime decided to abrogate all of the relevant international agreements , it is highly likely that it would get its weapon , even if the country itself was bombed repeatedly . 
The strategic emphasis on &quot; breakout time &quot; is thus misplaced . 
The key to progress is to help turn Iran from a cause into a country , to paraphrase Henry Kissinger . 
Iran needs to focus on developing all of its human and material resources to become part of a region moving from confrontation to cooperation . 
The deal on the core nuclear issues is central to this approach , but so is a credible process for developing the trade and investment links that will facilitate Iran &apos;s move from isolation to integration . 
As the talks enter the final phase , the issue of sanctions is likely to be at the forefront . 
This is because the Joint Plan of Action to which the parties agreed in November 2013 , while addressing virtually all of the West &apos;s immediate nuclear concerns , does not map out the necessary pathway to Iran &apos;s normalization . 
Just as conservative forces in Iran can be expected to try to stop an agreement , forces thriving on confrontation in the United States and elsewhere will do the same . 
Iran &apos;s hardliners play up doubts that the West will ever agree to lift the sanctions , while their Western counterparts will do whatever they can to support that presumption . 
A spiral of mutually destructive diplomacy might result . 
Here , the European Union should clearly signal its readiness to take the lead in easing and lifting restrictions on Iran , though this obviously must be done in close coordination with Europe &apos;s partners . 
An agreement should also be followed by sustained political engagement on other mutually important issues . 
Developments in Afghanistan and Iraq are obviously urgent . 
And , based on close consultation with both Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries , it may yet be possible to move toward more cooperative arrangements in that strategically vital region . 
That will require putting the issue of Syria squarely on the table . 
Four years after the outbreak of the country &apos;s civil war , and despite the horrific humanitarian consequences of the fighting , international diplomacy to stop the violence has achieved nothing . 
The United Nations Security Council has been split and ineffective , and even Russia seems to be gradually losing the leverage it once had in Damascus . 
Iran , the US , and the EU all share an interest in stopping a war that is causing the Syrian state to collapse - with all of the consequences seen in Iraq since 2003 - and strengthening the forces of Sunni jihadism across the region . 
Whether this is enough common ground for a constructive dialogue with Iran on ending Syria &apos;s civil war remains to be seen , but it is an option that must be pursued . 
The talks now reaching their endgame in Lausanne are confined to the nuclear issue ; but beyond the agreement loom larger possibilities and risks . 
A breakthrough might compel a phase of intense diplomacy , giving Iran a pathway to diplomatic normalization and opening the door for grand bargains that could begin to restore order and stability to the rest of the region . 
A breakdown , by contrast , though unlikely to lead immediately to war , could easily foment developments that lead in that direction , and the region as a whole could be pulled even deeper into the current vortex of chaos and violence . 
With the core nuclear issue more or less settled , it is now imperative to resolve sanctions and normalization issues and grasp the opportunity for regional grand bargains that might then become possible . 
The nuclear deal must mark the beginning of the international community &apos;s efforts to engage Iran in addressing the Middle East &apos;s toughest challenges .
