After Ahmadinejad 
WASHINGTON , DC - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s preferred successor , Esfandiar Rahim Mashai , will not be running in the June 14 election . 
Neither will former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani . 
The disqualification of both sends a strong message from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei . 
Simply put , Khamenei will not tolerate any diminution of his power , and he is determined to avoid the type of friction that has characterized his relationships with previous presidents , particularly Ahmadinejad . 
The disqualification of Mashai and Rafsanjani reveals , once again , the schism embedded at the heart of Iran &apos;s political structure by the dual executive of Supreme Leader and President . 
When Khamenei publicly supported Ahmadinejad &apos;s controversial reelection in 2009 , no one could have predicted the unprecedented tensions that would subsequently emerge between the country &apos;s two main authorities . 
But supporting Ahmadinejad turned out to be a costly decision for Khamenei - and for the Islamic Republic . 
Instead of aligning himself with Khamenei , as expected , Ahmadinejad began to promote a nationalist , anti-clerical agenda , effectively using Khamenei &apos;s resources to challenge the supreme leader &apos;s authority and to establish his own economic network and sphere of influence . 
Over the last four years , Ahmadinejad has repeatedly tried to undermine the ruling clerics &quot; control over political and policy decisions . 
In 2011 , he attempted to dismiss Heider Moslehi , an ally of Khamenei , from his position as intelligence chief , but was quickly overruled . 
He has also reduced the resources channeled to certain religious institutions , helped those in his circle to establish private banks by easing regulations , and challenged Iran &apos;s most powerful economic and military institution , the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ( IRGC ) . 
But , as the rift between Khamenei and Ahmadinejad has grown , support for the president has declined significantly , with even state-run media referring to Ahmadinejad &apos;s loyalists as a &quot; deviation circle . &quot; 
Moreover , unlike during Ahmadinejad &apos;s first term , non-state media now publicly criticize his economic and political agenda . 
With the end of Ahmadinejad &apos;s second and final term fast approaching , it seems unlikely that the disgraced , unpopular president will abandon his efforts to destabilize Iran &apos;s ruling establishment . 
In fact , he had long promoted Mashai as his successor , but Khamenei curtailed his illegal efforts - and has now put a stop to Mashai &apos;s candidacy altogether . 
Mashai is among Iran &apos;s most controversial figures , widely reviled among conservative leaders for his reformist , anti-clerical views . 
In 2009 , after Khamenei rejected Ahmadinejad &apos;s decision to appoint Mashai as his first deputy , Ahmadinejad brazenly appointed him Chief of Staff , a move that infuriated Khamenei . 
Ahmadinejad is not the first high-ranking official in Iran to challenge the supreme leader . 
Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri , one of Iran &apos;s most senior clerics , would have been Supreme Leader himself had he not fallen out with Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the Islamic Republic &apos;s founder , a few months before Khomeini &apos;s death . One of the most influential figures in Iran during the Republic &apos;s first decade , Montazeri provided an extensive justification for the supreme leader &apos;s absolute authority , which many ayatollahs considered heretical . 
But he soon began to challenge the Islamic Republic &apos;s hardline leadership - and continued to do so until he died in 2009 . 
Montazeri , whose status as Grand Ayatollah ( the most senior of Shia Muslim theologians ) gave him more religious authority than Khamenei , challenged Khamenei &apos;s qualifications to issue fatwas ( Islamic religious rulings ) or to succeed Khomeini as Supreme Leader . 
Montazeri was placed under house arrest for six years ; demonstrations of support for him were suppressed ; and many of his disciples and close friends were imprisoned , tortured , killed , or forced to flee the country . 
Likewise , Abulhassan Banisadr , the Islamic Republic &apos;s first president , fell out with Khomeini over the division of authority . 
He was impeached in 1981 , after only a year in power , and fled to France , where he continues to reside . 
Violent street clashes between Banisadr &apos;s supporters and opponents resulted in deaths on both sides . 
In many ways , Ahmadinejad &apos;s story resembles that of Banisadr . 
Both were relatively unknown before their presidencies ; both depended on the supreme leader &apos;s backing to gain power ; and both gradually lost support as they attempted to reduce the influence of the clerical hierarchy and the IRGC . 
Most important , both failed to create an external organization on which they could rely if their official protection failed . 
The fact that Ahmadinejad has been allowed to serve out his entire second term - an outcome that the media often doubted - reflects the importance to Khamenei of maintaining an image of a stable Iran . 
But achieving that goal will require Khamenei to account for Ahmadinejad &apos;s unpredictability . 
With nothing to lose , Ahmadinejad could decide to destabilize the Islamic Republic if he considers it necessary for his survival . 
He might also oppose Khamenei directly , portraying himself as a patriotic anti-clerical figure . 
After the election , the kind of factional disputes that have long paralyzed policymaking in Iran will likely persist . 
Indeed , the lack of a strong , unified government capable of shaping a consensus could make it impossible even for Khamenei to change course , leaving Iran no choice but to persist in its diplomatic standoff with the West .
