The Entrepreneurial University 
by Henry Etzkowitz By Henry Etzkowitz 
Universities have long played an essential role in economic development , providing the skills , training , ideas , and basic research that all countries need to ensure progress and growth . 
But how directly should an academic institution involve itself in for-profit activities ? 
If it establishes its own businesses , or supports those founded by its members , does the university risk undermining its traditional independence and commitment to open intellectual exchange ? 
During the past two decades , academic research in an increasing number of countries has become a profit-seeking enterprise . 
According to the Association of University Technology Managers , at least 300 new companies based on inventions at US universities were formed in 2000 . 
What began as a unique American model in 1980 , when the US Congress turned over to universities intangible intellectual property arising from federally supported academic research , has spread to such diverse countries as the United Kingdom , Sweden , and Zambia . 
Inevitably , profit-oriented academic science has become an increasingly guided process , assisted by university technology-transfer offices , entrepreneurship centers , and incubator facilities . 
Typically , faculty members establish private firms , often with students and support staff , while retaining their academic positions , and university administrations invest in legally independent incubator companies , usually in molecular biology , computer science , combinatorial chemistry , and other fields . 
Asserting proprietary rights over academic research , opponents charge , amounts to a conflict of interest , very similar to that of a public official who uses her office for private gain , or an attorney who represents clients on both sides of a legal case . 
According to this argument , academic scientists should either publish their research openly or leave the university before pursuing commercial interests . 
Similarly , the universities that employ them should leave product development to existing companies . 
But it is useful to recall that the university has been accused of subverting its own ideals and social role since time immemorial , yet what in the past initially looked to many like a conflict of interest often later came to be viewed as a confluence of purposes . 
For example , during the late 19 th century , as US universities began to place research at the heart of the academic mission , they were accused of forsaking their traditional pedagogical role . 
Many professors argued that the demands of research would render their teaching obligations impossible to fulfill . 
Of course , a major reason for this broadening of the university &apos;s role was its cost effectiveness : combining research and teaching was far less expensive than maintaining separate institutions for each purpose , as became commonplace in Europe . 
Nevertheless , although some still lament the emphasis that universities now place on research , proponents of expanding the university &apos;s mission have for the most part been vindicated on pedagogical grounds . 
The knowledge generated by faculty members &apos; research infuses their teaching with relevance and vitality . 
Opposition to universities &apos; new entrepreneurial role is likely to undergo a similar evolution . 
For , as in the past , accusations of an inherent conflict of interest are symptomatic of a profound change in the academic mission . 
This is not to say that such conflicts do not exist and will never appear ; rather , they are likely to become manageable as universities and faculty members learn how to pursue basic research in tandem with the capitalization of knowledge . 
As this occurs , attitudes will once again be modified and opposition will dissipate . 
In fact , insistence on maintaining the traditional division of labor between public science and private-sector research is already futile . 
Academic and entrepreneurial activities increasingly occur along a continuum , and there can be no turning back . 
Instead , universities are learning to balance their academic and business roles in the increasingly brief interval between discovery and commercialization of research findings . 
Once academic research is defined as a marketable good and treated as intellectual property , the traditional forms of dissemination , such as publication in academic journals and presentations at conferences , continue , although a new set of conditions applies , with &quot; limited secrecy &quot; delaying publication to allow time for patenting . 
But even in these cases , if universities take a strong stand for openness , companies usually agree , and technology-transfer offices have dramatically reduced the time needed to file an intention to patent . 
Moreover , the academic technology-transfer process often works in favor of scientific openness . 
After all , having a paper published in a major journal can help a company seeking funds to support product development and boost the value of its stock . 
Licensing , joint ventures , and the marketing of products that result from research offer additional avenues for wide dissemination of new knowledge , above and beyond publication . 
The typical entrepreneurial university will contain , or be surrounded by , a penumbra of firms that originated from academic research , perhaps even sharing infrastructure . 
Courses may include private-sector internships , and firms may use academic resources such as libraries and computing facilities . 
This type of cross-utilization has proceeded farthest in newer industries , such as biotechnology , which already offer post-doctoral positions that approximate conditions in universities . 
As the university immerses itself more deeply in a wider range of commercial activities , new institutional relationships will almost certainly emerge - often with the encouragement and support of government . 
These changes remain largely incipient , and their ultimate impact on the university as we now know it is impossible to foresee . 
But the sooner we adapt to the new academic mission that has already begun re-defining the university , the better we will be able to isolate and minimize the risks identified by its critics .
