The Philippines Joins the Asian Race 
MANILA - In 1980 , my father arrived in the United States to undergo a heart bypass , due to the rigors of his imprisonment by the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos . 
The dictatorship offered him a reprieve , but , true to its nature , one dependent on its whims . 
Having already been condemned by a kangaroo court to death by musketry , my father refused to hoist a white flag . 
&quot; The Filipino , &quot; he insisted , &quot; is worth dying for . &quot; 
Three years later , my father went home , not to die , but to infuse new life into the demoralized ranks of the opposition to the dictatorship . 
His assassination upon his arrival at Manila airport became the ultimate proof of the sincerity of what he had proclaimed throughout his life . 
In 1986 , my countrymen peacefully defied Marcos &apos;s tanks and demonstrated their faith in themselves . 
Marcos fled , and democracy was restored without bloodshed . 
My mother , who then became President , also had an enduring message : the democracy that we had regained at such a high price could be ensured only by a vigorous commitment to making its institutions work . 
In 2009 , my countrymen again took to the streets to accompany my mother to her final resting place . 
This massive expression of solidarity evolved into an effort to draft me to run for the presidency in 2010 . 
At the polls , my countrymen conferred a solemn mandate on me to make democracy the means for eliminating corruption and alleviating poverty . 
Our administration is committed to transforming a country where nice guys finish last into one where those who deviate from the straight and narrow face punishment for their crimes . 
Our goal is to empower citizens to demand the rule of law , regardless of who is in power . 
My colleagues in government are expected to demonstrate this by means of sustained reforms that foster meritocracy , transparency , and accountability . 
We started with the National Food Authority , a government corporation tasked with ensuring an adequate supply of rice . 
From 1972 to 2000 , the NFA accumulated 12.9 billion pesos ( $ 290 million ) in debt . 
Within a year of taking office , my predecessor increased the NFA &apos;s debt to 18 billion pesos . 
In the course of the next eight and a half years , her administration imported much more rice than was needed , resulting in 177 billion pesos in debt by the time she stepped down . 
In a shift from the illogical import policy of the past , we focused our energies on revitalizing rural irrigation , which boosted the first dry-season crop yields . 
This year , our government will import 64 % less rice than in 2010 . 
My father taught me that the most important freedom is freedom from hunger . 
Without food security , individuals can have no chance of achieving social mobility . 
That is why we are investing in our fellow citizens by means of a conditional cash-transfer program , called Pantawid Pamilya in Tagalog , which is patterned after Brazil &apos;s Bolsa Familia . 
We are also providing cash assistance to eligible poor families on the condition that pregnant mothers and children avail themselves of preventive health care , and that children regularly attend school . 
This program already covers roughly 2.3 million poor families , providing them with yet another key to social mobility . 
Mobilizing resources for these programs depends on cutting wasteful programs and rooting out corruption in our bureaucracy . 
One agency where large-scale graft and corruption was traditionally rampant was the Department of Public Works and Highways . 
By instituting open , competitive , and transparent bidding , the department has saved 2.5 billion pesos from 3,692 projects nationwide in the past year . 
We expect 6-7 billion pesos in savings by the end of this year , which can be used for other high-priority development projects . 
To promote fiscal transparency , our Finance Department has created a Web site called &quot; Pera ng Bayan , &quot; or &quot; The People &apos;s Money . &quot; 
It allows the public to report tax cheats , smugglers , and crooks anonymously . 
The government likewise subjects officials to lifestyle checks and vets their statements of assets and liabilities to find out if what they have acquired is commensurate with their declared income . 
These campaigns are yielding results . 
Sixty-seven tax-evasion cases and 43 smuggling cases , with claims totaling more than 26 billion pesos and 58 billion pesos , respectively , have been filed against groups and individuals . 
But it is not enough to be efficient and honest in public spending . 
We must also attract foreign investment , despite the difficulties facing Europe , the US , and Japan . 
Our economic diplomacy has three key objectives , one of which is to secure more markets for our exports and enticing more tourists to visit the country . 
Our diplomacy is also focused on protecting the well-being of the roughly ten million Filipinos working overseas . 
Investment has been coming in , but more is needed . 
Our Business Process Outsourcing industry is now the second largest in the world , behind India , with revenues of $ 8.9 billion in 2010 rising to a projected $ 11 billion in 2011 . 
The Philippines also ranks fourth in the world in terms of shipbuilding . 
Our sound fiscal management has been widely recognized , with all of the major credit ratings agencies upgrading the Philippines within our government &apos;s first year . 
The Philippines reopened for business under new management only a little more than a year ago . 
It is faring very well - and is set to become increasingly profitable .
