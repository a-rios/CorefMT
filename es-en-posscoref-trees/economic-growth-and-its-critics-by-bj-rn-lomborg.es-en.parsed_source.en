The Limits to Panic 
COPENHAGEN - We often hear how the world as we know it will end , usually through ecological collapse . 
Indeed , more than 40 years after the Club of Rome released the mother of all apocalyptic forecasts , The Limits to Growth , its basic ideas are still with us . 
But time has not been kind . 
The Limits to Growth warned humanity in 1972 that devastating collapse was just around the corner . 
But , while we have seen financial panics since then , there have been no real shortages or productive breakdowns . 
Instead , the resources generated by human ingenuity remain far ahead of human consumption . 
But the report &apos;s fundamental legacy remains : we have inherited a tendency to obsess over misguided remedies for largely trivial problems , while often ignoring big problems and sensible remedies . 
In the early 1970 &quot; s , the flush of technological optimism was over , the Vietnam War was a disaster , societies were in turmoil , and economies were stagnating . 
Rachel Carson &apos;s 1962 book Silent Spring had raised fears about pollution and launched the modern environmental movement ; 
The first Earth Day , in 1970 , was deeply pessimistic . 
The genius of The Limits to Growth was to fuse these worries with fears of running out of stuff . 
We were doomed , because too many people would consume too much . 
Even if our ingenuity bought us some time , we would end up killing the planet and ourselves with pollution . 
The only hope was to stop economic growth itself , cut consumption , recycle , and force people to have fewer children , stabilizing society at a significantly poorer level . 
That message still resonates today , though it was spectacularly wrong . 
For example , the authors of The Limits to Growth predicted that before 2013 , the world would have run out of aluminum , copper , gold , lead , mercury , molybdenum , natural gas , oil , silver , tin , tungsten , and zinc . 
Instead , despite recent increases , commodity prices have generally fallen to about a third of their level 150 years ago . 
Technological innovations have replaced mercury in batteries , dental fillings , and thermometers : mercury consumption is down 98 % and , by 2000 , the price was down 90 % . 
More broadly , since 1946 , supplies of copper , aluminum , iron , and zinc have outstripped consumption , owing to the discovery of additional reserves and new technologies to extract them economically . 
Similarly , oil and natural gas were to run out in 1990 and 1992 , respectively ; today , reserves of both are larger than they were in 1970 , although we consume dramatically more . 
Within the past six years , shale gas alone has doubled potential gas resources in the United States and halved the price . 
As for economic collapse , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that global GDP per capita will increase 14-fold over this century and 24-fold in the developing world . 
The Limits of Growth got it so wrong because its authors overlooked the greatest resource of all : our own resourcefulness . 
Population growth has been slowing since the late 1960 &quot; s . 
Food supply has not collapsed ( 1.5 billion hectares of arable land are being used , but another 2.7 billion hectares are in reserve ) . 
Malnourishment has dropped by more than half , from 35 % of the world &apos;s population to under 16 % . 
Nor are we choking on pollution . 
Whereas the Club of Rome imagined an idyllic past with no particulate air pollution and happy farmers , and a future strangled by belching smokestacks , reality is entirely the reverse . 
In 1900 , when the global human population was 1.5 billion , almost three million people - roughly one in 500 - died each year from air pollution , mostly from wretched indoor air . 
Today , the risk has receded to one death per 2,000 people . 
While pollution still kills more people than malaria does , the mortality rate is falling , not rising . 
Nonetheless , the mindset nurtured by The Limits to Growth continues to shape popular and elite thinking . 
Consider recycling , which is often just a feel-good gesture with little environmental benefit and significant cost . 
Paper , for example , typically comes from sustainable forests , not rainforests . 
The processing and government subsidies associated with recycling yield lower-quality paper to save a resource that is not threatened . 
Likewise , fears of over-population framed self-destructive policies , such as China &apos;s one-child policy and forced sterilization in India . 
And , while pesticides and other pollutants were seen to kill off perhaps half of humanity , well-regulated pesticides cause about 20 deaths each year in the US , whereas they have significant upsides in creating cheaper and more plentiful food . 
Indeed , reliance solely on organic farming - a movement inspired by the pesticide fear - would cost more than $ 100 billion annually in the US . 
At 16 % lower efficiency , current output would require another 65 million acres of farmland - an area more than half the size of California . 
Higher prices would reduce consumption of fruits and vegetables , causing myriad adverse health effects ( including tens of thousands of additional cancer deaths per year ) . 
Obsession with doom-and-gloom scenarios distracts us from the real global threats . 
Poverty is one of the greatest killers of all , while easily curable diseases still claim 15 million lives every year - 25 % of all deaths . 
The solution is economic growth . 
When lifted out of poverty , most people can afford to avoid infectious diseases . 
China has pulled more than 680 million people out of poverty in the last three decades , leading a worldwide poverty decline of almost a billion people . 
This has created massive improvements in health , longevity , and quality of life . 
The four decades since The Limits of Growth have shown that we need more of it , not less . 
An expansion of trade , with estimated benefits exceeding $ 100 trillion annually toward the end of the century , would do thousands of times more good than timid feel-good policies that result from fear-mongering . 
But that requires abandoning an anti-growth mentality and using our enormous potential to create a brighter future .
