The Spires of Renewal 
PRAGUE - A dominant feature of Prague is the Gothic tower of the Cathedral of St. Vitus , St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert . 
That tower is now wrapped in scaffolding because - for the first time ever and , so to speak , at the eleventh hour - it is being renovated . 
Temporarily , the scaffold conceals the tower &apos;s beauty . 
That concealment , however , is designed to preserve this beauty forever . 
Perhaps this scaffolding serves as an analogy for all postcommunist countries . 
If some of our best features are not quite visible for the time being , it is because our societies are covered by scaffolding as they undergo reconstruction , striving anew - this time in complete freedom - to rediscover and restore our true identities . 
Perhaps this analogy should also be applied even more generally , in the hope that , behind some of the unsightly features of today &apos;s world , seeds of an endeavor to save , preserve and creatively develop the values offered to us by the history of nature and the human race can be found . 
An unprecedented feature of our global civilization is that it is basically atheistic , notwithstanding the billions of people who profess , whether actively or passively , to believe in a religion . 
Indeed , the underlying values of our global civilization rarely , if ever , relate to eternity , to the infinite and absolute . 
Everywhere there is a decline in concern for that which will come after us , and for the common interest . 
Humanity depletes non-renewable natural resources and interferes with the planet &apos;s climate . 
Humanity becomes estranged from itself by gradually liquidating appreciable human communities and human proportions . 
Humanity tolerates a cult of material gain as the highest value to which all must yield and before which even the democratic will must sometimes fall to its knees . 
Creating wealth , indeed , has ceased to correspond with creating real and meaningful values . 
This denaturing of the spirit means that our civilization is wrought with paradoxes . 
It is opened to possibilities that , until recently , were mere fairy-tales . 
On the other hand , it holds only a limited ability to avert developments that infuse these possibilities with danger , or result in outright abuse . 
Our civilization , for example , is pressured toward uniformity , but the fact that we are drawn ever closer to one another gives rise to an urge to emphasize our otherness , which can grow into callous ethnic or religious fanaticism . 
New sophisticated types of criminal activities , organized crime and terrorism , are emerging . 
Corruption flourishes . 
The gap between rich and poor grows deeper , and while people die of starvation in some parts of the world , other places see waste as a type of social obligation . 
Various government and non-governmental organizations attempt , of course , to resolve these problems . 
Yet I am afraid that the measures undertaken will not lead to any reversal unless something changes in the root thinking from which contemporary human behavior grows . 
For example , we often hear about the need to restructure the economies of poor countries , about wealthier nations being duty-bound to help in this . 
But it is even more important that we begin to think about another restructuring , a restructuring of the system of values that forms the basis of today &apos;s civilization . 
This is of greatest urgency for those who are better off in material terms . 
The course of today &apos;s global civilization , indeed , has been determined by the wealthiest and most advanced nations . 
For this reason , they cannot be relieved of the necessity to engage in a critical reflection . 
We know that it is possible to devise ingenious regulatory instruments to protect the Earth &apos;s climate , non-renewable resources , and biological diversity ; to find ways to ensure that resources are used accountably at the places of their origin and that cultural identities and a human dimensions for development is maintained . 
Many people and institutions are actively working toward this end . 
But the crucial task now being neglected involves strengthening a system of universally shared moral standards that will make it impossible , on a truly global scale , for rules to be circumvented time and again . 
Only universal moral standards can generate natural respect for the rules we develop . 
Actions which jeopardize humanity &apos;s future should not only be punishable but regarded as disgraceful . 
This will not happen unless we all find , within ourselves , the courage to forge an order of values that , despite all the world &apos;s diversity , can be jointly embraced and jointly respected . 
This will not happen unless we relate these values to something that lies beyond the horizon of our immediate personal or group interest . 
How can this be achieved without a new and powerful advance in human spirituality ? 
What can be done to encourage such an advance ? 
Whatever our convictions , we are all threatened by our shortsightedness . 
None of us can escape our common destiny . 
Given this , we have only one possibility : to search inside ourselves as well as around us , for a sense of responsibility for the world ; for mutual understanding and solidarity ; for humility before the miracle of Being ; for the ability to restrain ourselves in the general interest and to perform good deeds even if they remain unseen and unrecognized . 
Allow me to return to the Cathedral of Saint Vitus , St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert . 
Why , in bygone ages , did people construct so costly an edifice , one with little use by today &apos;s standards ? 
One explanation is that there were periods in history when material gain was not the highest value ; when humanity knew that there were mysteries never to be understood , and before which people could only stand in humble amazement and perhaps project that amazement into structures whose spires point upwards . 
Upwards to be seen far and wide , highlighting to everyone that which is worth looking up to . 
Upwards , across the borders of ages . 
Upwards , to that which is beyond our sight - that which , by its silent existence , precludes  -  for all of us  -  any right to treat the world as an endless source of short-term profit and which calls for solidarity with all who dwell under its mysterious vault . 
To begin to address some of the world &apos;s deepest problems , we too must lift our eyes upwards as we bow our heads in humility .
