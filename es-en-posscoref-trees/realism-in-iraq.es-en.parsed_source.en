Realism in Iraq The Washington mountain has labored and brought forth less than a mouse . 
General David Petreaus and President George W. Bush have spoken , but United States policy in Iraq remains as it was . 
This policy has led the US into a trap , so that now the largest and most important power in the world is facing only bad options . 
If the US followed its national interests , it would withdraw from Iraq as soon as possible , because the war can no longer be won . 
It is weakening the West &apos;s leading power and strengthening the West &apos;s enemies . But the US cannot withdraw without sending the entire region into chaos . The US wanted to establish a democratic Iraq . 
Instead , after a US withdrawal , the country might fall apart , possibly leading to &quot; balkanization &quot; of the Middle East , with extremely dangerous consequences for the whole region . 
With the war in Iraq , the US also wanted to initiate a democratic transformation of the entire Middle East . 
Instead , it has helped Iran to gain a regional ascendancy that the country could never have achieved on its own . 
Instead of a democratic transformation , were the US to withdraw now , the Middle East would face a war of all against all for regional hegemony . 
There is no indication that Bush will begin to grasp this bitter reality during the remaining months of his term . 
If he were to admit defeat , his presidency would be destroyed . 
He will thus pass the war on to his successor . 
This might be advantageous for Bush &apos;s domestic purposes , but as a foreign policy , it will only escalate the risk of a Middle East explosion . 
The current US turn toward collaboration with Sunni militias holds within it the risk of a final break-up of Iraq into three parts . 
The key question is whether the consequences of Iraq &apos;s disintegration could be contained within its national borders , or whether large parts of the region would be affected . 
A disintegrating Iraq would draw all its neighbors and other powers in the region into an undeclared war of succession . 
Moreover , in the Middle East , there is no safety net like the European Union , which has helped lure the Balkans out of the abyss . 
The only way out of this dilemma is to set a reachable and realistic goal . 
Instead of victory , the goal must be a minimum of stability - and this still seems achievable . 
Indeed , US military withdrawal from Iraq can be accomplished without causing a major regional catastrophe only if America manages to establish such a minimum of regional stability . 
What this requires is a sustainable consensus that includes all the parties involved . 
Iraq &apos;s future , if it still has any , will depend first and foremost on Iraqi Shiites , Sunnis , and Kurds , and , secondly , on Iraq &apos;s neighbors and their interests and risk calculations . 
But even if Iraq does fall apart after US withdrawal , it will be of vital importance to contain the consequences of its disintegration within Iraq &apos;s own borders . 
This will require a regional consensus that only the US can bring about . 
It is hard to understand why the US does so little to advance the goal of regional stabilization , especially since it still retains considerable leverage in this respect . 
As no regional power is strong enough to win a war of succession outright , all of these powers could only lose if a conflict ensues . 
Indeed , all will be threatened by internal destabilization as a consequence of such a confrontation . 
Certainly , talks and conferences make little sense without a coherent policy . 
But with appropriate preparation , a regional solution is possible , and , of all the parties involved , Syria is uniquely positioned to help bring it about . 
Syria is the only Arab country allied with Iran , and , as Iraq &apos;s direct neighbor , it is crucial for Iraq &apos;s stabilization . 
Moreover , Lebanon &apos;s security and independence hinges on Syria , and Syria is one of the main actors in the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors . 
Finally , economically and politically , Syria is in a weak position , and its interests are by no means congruent with those of Iran . 
It &apos;s incomprehensible , then , why the US , having succeeded in striking a deal with Libya , vehemently rejects any initiative toward Syria . 
If Syria changed sides , the situation in the region would be fundamentally transformed . 
For Iran , this development would be tantamount to a strategic worst-case scenario , bringing about its definitive isolation . 
Should it become a realistic prospect , a decisive approach to Iran would make sense . 
The ensuing &quot; grand bargain &quot; should concern the stabilization of Iraq , Iran &apos;s nuclear program , and its role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
If successful , the bargain should also aim at a total normalization of relations between Iran and the US . 
To be sure , even a decisive regional strategy by the US and its Western partners will not stop terrorism and violence in Iraq or , indeed , in the Middle East overnight . 
But it would be a decisive first step toward changing the regional balance of power that would enable the stabilization of Iraq and the region as a whole . 
Only this can make a withdrawal of US troops from Iraq realistic in the foreseeable future .
