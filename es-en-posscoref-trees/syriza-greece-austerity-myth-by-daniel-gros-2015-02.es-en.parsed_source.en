The Greek Austerity Myth 
BRUSSELS - Since the anti-austerity Syriza party &apos;s victory in Greece &apos;s recent general election , the &quot; Greek problem &quot; is again preoccupying markets and policymakers throughout Europe . 
Some fear a return to the uncertainty of 2012 , when many thought that a Greek default and exit from the eurozone were imminent . 
Then as now , many worry that a Greek debt crisis could destabilize - and perhaps even bring down - Europe &apos;s monetary union . 
But this time really is different . 
One critical difference lies in economic fundamentals . 
Over the last two years , the eurozone &apos;s other peripheral countries have proven their capacity for adjustment , by reducing their fiscal deficits , expanding exports , and moving to current-account surpluses , thereby negating the need for financing . 
Indeed , Greece is the only one that has consistently dragged its feet on reforms and sustained abysmal export performance . 
Providing an additional shield to the peripheral countries is the European Central Bank &apos;s plan to begin purchasing sovereign bonds . 
Though the German government does not officially support quantitative easing , it should be grateful to the ECB for calming financial markets . 
Now Germany can take a tough stance on the new Greek government &apos;s demands for a large-scale debt write-off and an end to austerity , without fearing the kind of financial-market turbulence that in 2012 left the eurozone with little choice but to bail out Greece . 
In fact , both of the Greek government &apos;s demands are based on a misunderstanding . 
For starters , Syriza and others argue that Greece &apos;s public debt , at a massive 170 % of GDP , is unsustainable and must be cut . 
Given that the country &apos;s official debt constitutes the bulk of its overall public debt , the government wants it reduced . 
In fact , Greece &apos;s official creditors have granted it long enough grace periods and low enough interest rates that the burden is bearable . 
Greece actually spends less on debt service than Italy or Ireland , both of which have much lower ( gross ) debt-to-GDP ratios . 
With payments on Greece &apos;s official foreign debt amounting to only 1.5 % of GDP , debt service is not the country &apos;s problem . 
The relatively low debt-service cost also removes the justification for Syriza &apos;s demands for an end to austerity . 
The last bailout program from the &quot; troika &quot; ( the International Monetary Fund , the ECB , and the European Commission ) , initiated in 2010 , foresees a primary budget surplus ( which excludes interest payments ) of 4 % of GDP this year . 
That would be slightly more than is needed to cover interest payments , and would thus allow Greece finally to begin to reduce its debt . 
The new Greek government &apos;s argument that this is an unreasonable target fails to withstand scrutiny . 
After all , when faced with excessively high debt , other European countries - including Belgium ( from 1995 ) , Ireland ( from 1991 ) , and Norway ( from 1999 ) - maintained similar surpluses for at least ten years each , typically in the aftermath of a financial crisis . 
To be sure , one can reasonably argue that austerity in the eurozone has been excessive , and that fiscal deficits should have been much larger to sustain demand . 
But only governments with access to market finance can use expansionary fiscal policy to boost demand . 
For Greece , higher spending would have to be financed by lending from one or more official institutions . 
For the same reason , it is disingenuous to claim that the troika forced Greece into excessive austerity . 
Had Greece not received financial support in 2010 , it would have had to cut its fiscal deficit from more than 10 % of GDP to zero immediately . 
By financing continued deficits until 2013 , the troika actually enabled Greece to delay austerity . 
Of course , Greece is not the first country to request emergency financing to delay budget cuts , and then complain that the cuts are excessive once the worst is over . 
This typically happens when the government runs a primary surplus . 
When the government can finance its current spending through taxes - and might even be able to increase expenditure , if it does not have to pay interest - the temptation to renege on debt intensifies . 
It was widely anticipated that Greece would be tempted to follow this route when the troika program was initiated . 
Last year , the new Greek finance minister , Yanis Varoufakis , confirmed the prediction , arguing that a primary surplus would give Greece the upper hand in any negotiations on debt restructuring , because it could just suspend repayments to the troika , without incurring any financing problems . 
That approach would be a mistake . 
The practical problem for Greece now is not the sustainability of a debt that matures in 20-30 years and carries very low interest rates ; the real issue is the few payments to the IMF and the ECB that fall due this year - payments that the new government has promised to make . 
But , to follow through on this promise ( and hire more employees ) , Greece will need more financial support from its eurozone partners . 
Moreover , the country &apos;s financial system will need continuing support from the ECB . 
In other words , Greece &apos;s new government must now try to convince its European partners that it deserves more financial support , while pushing for a reduction of its existing debt and resisting the austerity policies on which previous lending was conditioned . 
For Syriza and its voters , the political honeymoon could be short .
