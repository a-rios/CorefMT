The New Frontiers of Loyalty 
LONDON - This is a tricky time to be a state , and an even trickier time to be a citizen . 
The nation-state , the classic provider of security and basic wellbeing in exchange for citizens &quot; loyalty , is under threat - both at home and as the fundamental unit of international affairs . 
New types of loyalty and association are challenging the state &apos;s traditional role . 
Some are geographic . 
In Europe alone , there at least 40 would-be Scotlands seeking separation of some kind from the countries in which they now find themselves . 
Other loyalties are based on other kindred identities - not just religious or ethnic , but based on shared commercial , political , or other interests . 
Today , many more of us are supporters of NGOs than are members of political parties . 
In short , our allegiances , particularly in the West , have rarely seemed more divided than they do now . 
Amartya Sen , the Nobel laureate economist , has argued that we can learn to live with these multiple identities and even thrive with the diversity of citizenship and loyalties that they allow us . 
But this diversity is not entirely benign . 
Many of us work for or hold stock in commercial organizations that seem to pay scant regard to national tax or regulatory authorities . 
And , in much of the West , states adhere to models of welfare provision that increasingly disappoint their citizens and are often unaffordable . 
A global reordering of economic growth is punishing the developed countries &quot; high-cost , high-tax , high-benefits governance model . 
The Western state &apos;s shortcomings are strikingly apparent when compared with robust survivors and adapters in other parts of the world . 
China represents what might be called the Economic Security State : seeking to channel domestic savings into household consumption to sustain GDP growth and popular support , while using its investment power abroad to secure the commodities and energy that underpin its industrialization . 
Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi &apos;s leadership , India may prove to be a semi-admiring imitator of China . 
Russia , by contrast , is a more classic National Security State , now playing Western anxieties like a fiddle to consolidate its tightening grip on Ukraine and suppress domestic opposition with a tide of official nationalism . 
So we live in a world of evolutionary state disorder . 
While some in the West may yearn for the return of the strong , unifying state , most of us recognize that it is not coming back . 
Indeed , some argue that the inventiveness and internationalism of a world networked by interests and shared causes is likely to be more resilient than one crammed into the artificial - and increasingly constraining - box of the national state . 
In that sense , economic success in China or India may be those states &quot; undoing , as middle-class political aspirations render current arrangements dysfunctional . 
Conversely , we may find ourselves in a world whose eastern half is organized into strong authoritarian state structures , with the West embracing post-state models of association . 
The question for international governance is how to provide a framework of institutions and rules in a world of competing organizational structures . 
The politicians &quot; answer is depressingly predictable : in the face of a resurgent Russia and China , this is no time to abandon our own states and diplomacy to their fate . 
Yet the old systems no longer offer useful answers , as Russia has demonstrated by brushing aside the United Nations Security Council - the high altar of the state-based international system - over Ukraine and stalemating it over Syria . 
And , away from the din of their ranting politicians , what Russians , as much as Americans or Chinese , probably want most is a peaceful , predictable international order that allows them to provide for their families and enjoy the benefits of a golden age of global commerce and technology . 
A world , in which states &quot; hard power is contending with the soft power of transnational ideas , invention , and finance , needs rules . 
We will all pay dearly - in defense budgets and , more important , in lost global opportunities - if we do not summon the courage to design a global order in which non-state actors have a formal role . 
Otherwise , we would be inviting states to continue pursuing a might-makes-right approach and to shirk the coordinated action on , say , financial regulation and the environment that the world now requires . 
Of course , states do not have a monopoly on bad behavior . 
Transnational economic activity has been an opportunity not only for business , but also for organized crime and others to liberate themselves from effective regulation . 
At the moment , the United States has stepped into the breach , relying on often-Draconian extraterritorial use of its justice system and control of the international banking system to impose a crude frontier justice . 
That is not good enough . 
What is needed is a legitimate system of rules , norms , and institutions , devised by private as well as government stakeholders , that reflects the emerging global nature of economic , political , and social activity as the old state loses its dominance and must coexist with a patchwork of non-state structures of association .
