Playing Chicken with Democracy 
PRINCETON - In the increasingly nerve-wracking standoff between Greece and the European Union , the Greek authorities seem to be claiming a democratic mandate that extends beyond their country &apos;s borders . 
The new government , led by the far-left Syriza party , portrays itself not just as a negotiator trying to get a good deal for Greece , but as the champion of a solution to a supposedly European problem of excessive government debt . 
That stance fails to acknowledge that Greece &apos;s interlocutors have democratic responsibilities of their own . 
Modern democratic politics can be thought of as involving two types of tasks : the formulation of laws based on general principles , and the redistribution of resources via government taxation and expenditure . 
Within a single country , these tasks are relatively uncomplicated . 
Such constraints are particularly strong when the government must operate within a wider polity , as is true of Greece by virtue of its EU membership . 
But any process of integration , whether European or global , requires some adjustment of domestic preferences and laws . 
A government &apos;s ability to redistribute wealth will also be limited if raising taxes causes capital or high-income earners to flee the country . 
In making its case for a reduction of Greece &apos;s debt burden , Syriza draws heavily on the history of Germany , its principal creditor and , in the eyes of many Greeks , their country &apos;s primary antagonist . 
According to Syriza &apos;s depiction of events , Germany &apos;s interwar experiment in democracy failed because international creditors imposed austerity . 
Germany and the EU , the argument goes , should apply that lesson to Greece . 
That certainly sounds compelling , and another aspect of Syriza &apos;s analogy seems , at first glance , to seal the case : Greece was one of the countries that suffered most after the German Weimar Republic collapsed in 1933 . 
During the Nazi occupation , the government was forced to provide Germany with a loan that has yet to be repaid . 
Thus , Germany bears a historic responsibility to its southern European partners . 
But history can never be so neatly potted , and Syriza &apos;s interpretation suffers from some fatal lacunae . 
For example , though the reparations demanded by the victors of World War I were certainly burdensome , by 1932 it had become clear that they would never be paid . 
On the contrary , it cleared the way for increasingly radical agendas . 
If the country &apos;s populists ( the Nazis ) had come to power before 1932 , they would have faced an impossible choice . 
If they continued the reparation payments or attempted to negotiate with Germany &apos;s &quot; creditors , &quot; they would have discredited themselves in the eyes of their supporters . 
But the alternative - implementation of their program and a default on Germany &apos;s debt - would have triggered a deeper financial crisis ( and possibly a military invasion ) . 
It was only after payments were suspended that the German response to the Great Depression became so destructive . 
When Adolf Hitler came to power , he introduced an entirely new solution to the problem of redistribution . 
If Germany &apos;s resources were limited , he would redistribute other countries &apos; resources - the resources of countries like Greece . 
This view flips Syriza &apos;s argument on its head . 
Like Hitler &apos;s solution , the proposed cancellation of Greek debt is an attempt to redistribute other countries &apos; gains . 
Were it to succeed , it would strain every other country in the eurozone , including those , like Italy and Spain , that have had to carry out their own belt-tightening . 
Greece &apos;s charismatic finance minister , Yanis Varoufakis , recently cited a lesson from his country &apos;s ancient history : &quot; Sometimes the larger , powerful democracies undermined themselves by crushing the smaller ones . &quot; 
When democracy is used to justify shifting a country &apos;s burden onto its neighbors , integration becomes impossible - and both democracy and the international order may be jeopardized . 
Just as financial contagion can spread market uncertainties through neighboring economies , so , too , can political contagion spread the adoption of a zero-sum mentality . 
If Europe is to find a solution to its economic problems , it will have to overcome its political challenges first , and craft a form of deliberation that includes all elected governments of the eurozone ( the best current approximation is the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers ) . 
As long as negotiations are reduced to national governments playing games of chicken , the only result will be chaos - and not just in the markets .
