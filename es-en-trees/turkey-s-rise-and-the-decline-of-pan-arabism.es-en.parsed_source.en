Turkey &apos;s Rise and the Decline of Pan-Arabism 
TEL AVIV - The deadly fiasco of the Turkish-led &quot; peace flotilla &quot; to Gaza highlighted the deepening strain in the Israeli-Turkish alliance . 
But it mainly helped expose the deeper , underlying reasons for Turkey &apos;s shift from its Western orientation toward becoming a major player in the Middle East - in alliance with the region &apos;s rogue regimes and radical non-state actors . 
Foreign policy cannot be separated from its domestic foundations . 
The identity of nations , their ethos , has always been a defining motive in their strategic priorities . 
Israel &apos;s blunders did , of course , play a role in the erosion of its alliance with Turkey . 
But the collapse of its old &quot; alliance of the periphery , &quot; including Turkey , the Shah &apos;s Iran , and Ethiopia , had more to do with revolutionary changes in those countries - the Ayatollah Khomeini &apos;s rise to power , the end of Emperor Haile Selassie &apos;s regime , and now Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan &apos;s Islamic shift - than with Israeli policies . 
The current crisis reveals the depth of Turkey &apos;s identity complex , its oscillation between its Western-oriented Kemalist heritage and its Eastern Ottoman legacy . 
Snubbed by the European Union , Erdogan is tilting the balance towards the latter . 
Kemalism always saw the Ottoman legacy as a burden , an obstacle to modernization . 
In Erdogan &apos;s vision , modernization does not preclude a return to Turkey &apos;s Islamic roots , nor does it require it to abandon its destiny as a Middle East power , even if this means flouting United States-led policies in the region . 
Indeed , Erdogan responded positively to Europe &apos;s conditions for Turkey &apos;s EU membership . 
His reforms - economic liberalization , cooperation with the European Court of Human Rights , improving the Kurdish minority &apos;s rights , and undercutting the army &apos;s Praetorian ambitions - are major advances in the history of the Turkish Republic . 
Yet Erdogan has also been eager to use Europe &apos;s requirements as a pretext to curb the army &apos;s capacity to check his Islamic revolution . 
The election of his political ally , Abdullah Gul , as president , against the army &apos;s will - indeed , against the entire Kemalist tradition - is a case in point . 
To block a move aimed at outlawing his Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , Erdogan also domesticated Turkey &apos;s constitutional court - together with the army a watchdog of Kemalism - by arbitrarily changing its composition . 
Now a constitutional reform supposedly aimed at &quot; promoting Turkey &apos;s EU membership &quot; would further curb the army &apos;s role as the guardian of the secular state and strengthen government control of the judiciary . 
Erdogan &apos;s Islamic revolution has also expanded into the educational system with the introduction of a markedly religious curriculum . 
To back Turkey &apos;s strategic shift , a new law has recently made the teaching of Arabic obligatory in schools . 
It is difficult to imagine a more symbolic blow to Ataturk &apos;s vision . 
Erdogan believes that , by exercising Turkey &apos;s capacity for mediation , he will recover the burden of his Ottoman forbears as the guarantors of peace and security in the Mashreq . 
Turkey &apos;s drive to serve as a peace broker between Israel and its Arab enemies , Erdogan &apos;s vociferous championship of the Palestinian cause , and his pretension to be the mediator in the nuclear dispute between Iran and the West reflect Turkey &apos;s changing perceptions of itself as a regional leader . 
To both Israel and the West , the regional context of Turkey &apos;s rise is especially disturbing . 
Erdogan &apos;s neo-Ottomanism is not a return to an idyllic Ottoman Commonwealth ; it is more a clash between a rising radical axis , led by two major non-Arab powers ( Turkey and Iran ) , and the declining Arab conservative regimes . 
Turkey put Israel in the dock of world opinion over the &quot; peace flotilla &quot; in a way that might still force Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s government to opt for credible peace negotiations , while providing a boost to Hamas and bringing about the imminent end of Iarael &apos;s Gaza blockade . 
Such a spectacular success only serves to highlight the impotence of the West &apos;s Arab allies . 
Indeed , Turkey &apos;s growing regional relevance is the measure of the Arabs &quot; failure . 
They failed to advance their peace initiative with Israel , and are complicit in the blockade of Gaza in the hope that Hamas will collapse , thereby humbling their own Islamist oppositions . 
As Islamist democracies whose governments emerge from popular elections , Iran and Turkey - and their Hamas and Hezbollah allies - can claim an advantage over the incumbent Arab regimes , all of which suffer from a desperately yawning legitimacy deficit . 
They are all secular autocracies kept in power by intrusive , all-powerful intelligence services . 
Erdogan &apos;s strategy makes him complicit with the agenda of the West &apos;s most vicious enemies . 
He even flirted with Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir &apos;s perverted Islamist rule , welcoming Bashir to Turkey after he was indicted by the International Criminal Court for massacres in Darfur on the grounds that &quot; Muslims do not commit genocide . &quot; 
Iran and Turkey are bound to assert their Islamic credentials more and more as they reach out to the Arab masses . 
That a pan-Islamic discourse has now replaced the cause of pan-Arabism is a major setback for moderate Arab regimes . 
Yet , despite Erdogan &apos;s creeping Islamic revolution , Turkey is not a second Iran . 
The AKP remains a progressive , heterogeneous party that sees no contradiction between Islam and democracy . 
Nor has it entirely given up on Turkey &apos;s European dream . 
Moreover , an increasingly robust secular opposition , the Republican People &apos;s Party ( CHP ) under the vigorous leadership of Kemal Kilicdaroglu , is bound to help stem the Islamist tide . 
With Israel &apos;s return to a sober peace strategy , and with an honest dialogue between Turkey and its NATO allies , the Turkish bridge between East and West can still be salvaged .
