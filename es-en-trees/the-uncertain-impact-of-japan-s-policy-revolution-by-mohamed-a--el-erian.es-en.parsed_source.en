The Japanese Experiment 
NEWPORT BEACH - After years of tweaks , Japan has now initiated a major shift in its policy paradigm , with reactions ranging from great optimism that the country may finally be lifted out of a quarter-century of economic stagnation , to concerns that the authorities &quot; dramatic change of course may in fact end up making things worse . 
But , while debate naturally focuses on Japan &apos;s economic , financial , and political maneuvers , the tipping point could well lie abroad . 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s new government has embraced a revolutionary ( rather than evolutionary ) economic-policy approach that engages several initiatives , some of which were once deemed implausible , unthinkable , or even undesirable . 
From the doubling of the money supply to additional fiscal stimulus and wide-ranging structural reforms , the new policy paradigm is nothing less than one of the boldest economic-policy experiments in Japan &apos;s post-war history . 
To demonstrate their seriousness , Japanese officials moved quickly to commit to measurable metrics . 
On the policy input side , they have specified and begun to implement purchases of securities totaling $ 75 billion per month ( three times as much , in relative terms , as the US Federal Reserve currently purchases under its unconventional monetary-policy regime ) . 
On the output side , and after many years of persistent deflation ( prices fell 0.5 % last month ) , Japan is now targeting a 2 % inflation rate within two years , thus underscoring its commitment to avoid a pre-mature withdrawal of monetary support for growth . 
Already , financial markets have responded with alacrity . 
The Japanese equity market is up an impressive 55 % since hints of the paradigm shift started hitting investors &quot; radar screens . 
At the same time , the Japanese yen has depreciated sharply , including by more than 20 % against the struggling euro . 
This response is part of the transmission mechanism for the Japanese government &apos;s policies . 
The surge in the stock market benefits domestic investors , making them likelier to spend more ( what economists call the &quot; wealth effect &quot; ) . 
This , in turn , should revive corporate &quot; animal spirits , &quot; leading to higher investment in new plants and equipment , together with higher wages and salaries . 
These are , of course , the same mechanisms that the Fed has targeted for almost three years in its own efforts to stimulate higher growth in the US . 
The macroeconomic outcomes have consistently fallen short of expectations , and there is reason to believe that it will be even more difficult in Japan for monetary policy alone to gain sufficient traction . 
Japan &apos;s aging population mutes the potential impact of both the wealth effect and animal spirits . 
Resource flexibility is lower than in the US . 
Interest rates are already low . 
The experience of deflation is well entrenched . 
And , given Japan &apos;s high level of public indebtedness , the risks of collateral damage and unintended consequences are potentially higher . 
With gross overall government debt already at 238 % of GDP , some worry that Japan would face the threat of economic and financial dislocation were a failed policy experiment to lead its private sector - which traditionally has displayed an enormous home bias - to disinvest from Japan . 
This does not mean that Japan &apos;s policy revolution will necessarily disappoint . 
But , critically , it does mean that even if you believe that the BOJ &apos;s actions are necessary for Japan to emerge from its economic malaise , they certainly are not sufficient . 
Japan &apos;s experiment requires meeting two additional conditions if it is to avoid going the way of previous failed policy initiatives : meaningful structural reforms that essentially change how segments of the economy respond and operate ; and other countries &quot; continued acquiescence in the currency depreciation needed to boost the impact of slower-moving domestic dynamics through meaningful gains in global market share . 
Meeting the first condition is in the hands of Japanese citizens and their elected representatives . 
The required reforms , though achievable , will test the government &apos;s resolve and implementation capabilities , as well as the population &apos;s willingness to face immediate disruptions in exchange for the promise of longer-term gains . 
The second requirement is very different . 
It can be achieved only if other countries are willing to sacrifice output , either because they have no choice , or because they believe that , over the medium-term , a stronger Japanese economy will benefit them as the longer-term income effects offset the impact of immediate market disruptions . 
But will the rest of the world accommodate Japan &apos;s bold policy experiment , or will it take protective steps and thus impede the operation of a crucial policy transmission mechanism ? 
While initial indications are encouraging , the jury is still out . 
Many affected countries - including those hit by the trade effects ( such as China , South Korea , Taiwan , and eurozone members ) and those susceptible to the capital-flow channel ( such as Brazil , Indonesia , and Mexico ) - have not yet had enough time to react . 
Japan &apos;s policy change was big and abrupt , and several of the countries on the receiving end have been focused on complex domestic challenges . 
A few countries - particularly Brazil , China , and South Korea - have noticed . 
But their reactions have been generally muted by Japan &apos;s success in getting a US-led initiative at the G-20 to classify its policy response as constituting the use of &quot; domestic tools &quot; to pursue &quot; domestic objectives . &quot; 
It is just a matter of time until the rest of the world catches up with the reality of how Japan &apos;s experiment affects them . 
The hope is that , bolstered by evidence of Japan &apos;s serious pursuit of structural reforms , they will accommodate the experiment in two ways : by not retaliating , and by undertaking their own domestic reforms that compensate for the output lost to Japan . 
In other words , a growing pie for all better accommodates all . 
The fear is that neither Japan &apos;s subsequent actions nor the affected countries &quot; domestic realities will justify the risk of lost market share , especially at a time when the global economy as a whole - and global policy coordination - is struggling . 
Here the risk involves currency wars and other beggar-thy-neighbor disruptions . 
There is currently insufficient data to predict either outcome confidently . 
As we await additional evidence , let us appreciate how rarely we witness , in real time , such a momentous policy shift .
