One Hand Clapping for Ben Bernanke 
WASHINGTON , DC - President Barack Obama &apos;s nomination of Ben Bernanke to a second term as Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve represents a sensible and pragmatic decision , but it is nothing to celebrate . 
Instead , it should be an occasion for reflection on the role of ideological groupthink among economists , including Bernanke , in contributing to the global economic and financial crisis . 
The decision to nominate Bernanke is sensible on two counts . 
First , the US and global economies remain mired in recession . 
Though the crisis may be over in the sense that outright collapse has been avoided , the economy remains vulnerable . 
As such , it makes sense not to risk a shock to confidence that could trigger a renewed downturn . 
Second , Bernanke is the best among his peers . 
He did eventually come to understand the nature and severity of the crisis , and then took decisive steps that contributed to halting the economic freefall . 
That record , combined with doubts that any of his peers would have done better , means replacing him with another mainstream candidate makes little sense . 
These two factors justify Bernanke &apos;s reappointment , but the faintness of praise is indicative of the deeper problems that his leadership has exposed . 
One such problem is Wall Street &apos;s implicit veto over the Fed . 
After all , a major reason for reappointing Bernanke is to avoid rocking financial markets . 
This also explains why Bernanke &apos;s only rivals are from his peer group - the only people whom financial markets would be willing to accept . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , placating financial markets was also invoked to justify the reappointment of Bernanke &apos;s predecessor , Alan Greenspan , and it is now perennially invoked to block change at the Fed and other central banks . 
In effect , financial markets have established an implicit veto over much of economic policy and the people who can hold top policymaking positions , and it is time to think how we can escape that hold . 
A second problem concerns the state of economics . 
Though Bernanke may be the best in his peer group , the fact is that the economic crisis decisively proved him and his peers to have been wrong . 
As a group , they joined in the adulation of Greenspan , whom one leading economist proclaimed &quot; the greatest central banker who ever lived . &quot; 
Almost without exception , mainstream economists failed to foresee the crisis , and even the few who did get the logic and unfolding of events wrong . 
For his part , Bernanke led the intellectual charge toward inflation targeting by central banks , arguing that setting a target for annual inflation was a full and sufficient framework for monetary policy . 
Such thinking contributed to neglect of asset and credit markets , promoted intellectual disregard for regulation , and fostered laissez-faire excess , because macroeconomic belief in the sufficiency of inflation targeting paired logically with microeconomic belief that credit markets would take care of themselves . 
In Greenspan &apos;s words , the &quot; self-interest of lending institutions &quot; would protect shareholders and the economy from lending excess . 
This thinking explains why the Fed under Bernanke &apos;s leadership was so slow to respond to the crisis , which began in August 2007 yet did not elicit a coherent and comprehensive response until November 2008 . 
The Fed certainly would have reacted sooner had it not been attached to a model of banking more appropriate to the 1950 &quot; s . 
Oblivious to the role of the shadow banking system , the Fed did not understand how its implosion would undermine the traditional banking system . 
The Fed simply failed to comprehend the significance of traditional banks &quot; large holdings of mark-to-market assets and their own engagement in shadow banking via off-balance-sheet &quot; structured investment vehicles . &quot; 
Any dispassionate assessment of the Fed &apos;s thinking before and well into the crisis shows that it failed to understand the economics of its own bailiwick , banking and financial markets . 
Moreover , the Fed promoted broader economic views about deregulation and the self-stabilizing nature of markets that the crisis has discredited . 
Though circumstances dictate that Bernanke is the best candidate and should be reappointed , the real challenge is to ensure a thorough intellectual housecleaning at the Fed in order to open space for alternative economic views . 
The great danger is that reappointing Bernanke will be interpreted as a green flag for a flawed status quo . 
That is where public debate and Bernanke &apos;s Senate confirmation hearings enter the picture . 
Those hearings should be an occasion for critical examination of what went wrong , and why . 
If that happens , Bernanke &apos;s reappointment can serve as a trigger for constructive change rather than an endorsement of a discredited paradigm .
