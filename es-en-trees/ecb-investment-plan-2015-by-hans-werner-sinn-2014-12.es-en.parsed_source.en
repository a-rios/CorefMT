Europe &apos;s Shadow Budget 
MUNICH - More details about the European Commission &apos;s € 315 billion ( $ 390 billion ) investment plan for 2015-2017 have finally come to light . 
The program , announced by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in November , amounts to a massive shadow budget , twice as large as the European Union &apos;s annual official budget , that will finance public investment projects and ultimately help governments circumvent debt limits established in the Stability and Growth Pact . 
The borrowing will be arranged through the new European Fund for Strategic Investment , operating under the umbrella of the European Investment Bank . 
The EFSI will be equipped with € 5 billion in start-up capital , produced through the revaluation of existing EIB assets , and will be backed by € 16 billion in guarantees from the European Commission . 
The fund is expected to leverage this to acquire roughly € 63 billion in loans , with private investors subsequently contributing some € 5 for every euro lent - bringing total investment to the € 315 billion target . 
Though EU countries will not contribute any actual funds , they will provide implicit and explicit guarantees for the private investors , in an arrangement that looks suspiciously like the joint liability embodied by Eurobonds . 
Faced with German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s categorical rejection of Eurobonds , the EU engaged a horde of financial specialists to find a creative way to circumvent it . 
They came up with the EFSI . 
Though the fund will not be operational until mid-2015 , EU member countries have already proposed projects for the European Commission &apos;s consideration . 
By early December , all 28 EU governments had submitted applications - and they are still coming . 
An assessment of the application documents conducted by the Ifo Institute for Economic Research , of which I am President , found that the nearly 2,000 potential projects would cost a total of € 1.3 trillion , with about € 500 billion spent before the end of 2017 . 
Some 53 % of those costs correspond to public projects ; 15 % to public-private partnerships ( PPPs ) ; 21 % to private projects ; and just over 10 % to projects that could not be classified . 
The public projects will presumably involve EFSI financing , with governments assuming the interest payments and amortization . 
The PPPs will entail mixed financing , with private entities taking on a share of the risk and the return . 
The private projects will include the provision of infrastructure , the cost of which is to be repaid through tolls or user fees collected by a private operator . 
Unlike some other critics , I do not expect the program to fail to bolster demand in the European economy . 
After all , the € 315 billion that is expected to be distributed over three years amounts to 2.3 % of the EU &apos;s annual GDP . 
Such a sizeable level of investment is bound to have an impact . 
But the program remains legally dubious , as it creates a massive shadow budget financed by borrowing that will operate parallel to the EU and national budgets , thereby placing a substantial risk-sharing burden on taxpayers . 
Because every country , regardless of its creditworthiness , can borrow at the same interest rate , projects will be undertaken in countries that recently have burned such huge amounts of capital that they can no longer tap financial markets for funding . 
Just like the many other &quot; protective &quot; measures taken during the crisis , this distortion of market processes will help to cement the sub-optimal allocation of European investment capital , hampering economic growth for years to come . 
Making matters worse , only a fraction of the new borrowing enabled by the mutualization of liability will be factored into national budgets . 
In recent years , banks have been berated for using shadow budgets , in the form of special-purpose vehicles and conduits , to take on excessive risk . 
It is worrisome , to say the least , that the EU is now resorting to similar tricks .
