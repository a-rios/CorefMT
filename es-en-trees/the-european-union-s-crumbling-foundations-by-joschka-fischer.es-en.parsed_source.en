The Erosion of Europe 
BERLIN - Just weeks ago , the worst of the financial crisis in Europe seemed to be over . 
Stability seemed to be returning . 
But appearances proved to be deceptive . 
While markets remained calm , the Cyprus crisis revealed the full extent of the political disaster that the eurozone crisis has wrought : the European Union is disintegrating at its core . 
Europeans &quot; current crisis of confidence concerning Europe is far more dangerous than renewed market anxiety , because it cannot be overcome with another liquidity injection by the ECB . 
Europe &apos;s old political order was based on competition , mistrust , power rivalries , and , ultimately , war among sovereign states . 
It collapsed on May 8 , 1945 , and was replaced by a system based on mutual trust , solidarity , the rule of law , and compromise . 
But , with the crisis eroding these foundations , trust is giving way to mistrust , solidarity is succumbing to ancient prejudices ( and even new hatred between the poor south and the rich north ) , and compromise is being overwhelmed by diktat . 
And Germany is once again at the center of the process of disintegration . 
That is because Germany , by far the EU &apos;s strongest economy , has enforced a strategy for overcoming the eurozone crisis that worked for Germany at the beginning of the millennium , but under completely different internal and external economic conditions . 
For the distressed southern European states , the German-backed mixture of austerity and structural reforms is proving fatal , because the decisive third and fourth components - debt relief and growth - are missing . 
It is only a matter of time before one of the large European crisis countries elects a political leadership that no longer accepts the austerity diktats . 
Even now , come election time , national governments more or less openly promise to protect their citizens from Europe , because Germany has seen to it that austerity and structural reforms take pride of place in managing the crisis . 
The argument that &quot; tough love &quot; was necessary in southern Europe , because nothing there would ever have changed otherwise , has been settled . 
The love has been very tough indeed , generating rapid economic contraction , massive unemployment ( upwards of 50 % among young people ) , and continued fiscal deterioration , owing to rising debt-service costs . 
Indeed , all eurozone members are now experiencing weak economic growth , if not recession . 
What does Germany want ? 
A German Europe would never work , and the country &apos;s political class lacks both the courage and the determination to pursue a European Germany . 
So , does Germany want to hold together the monetary union and thus preserve the EU , or will it allow dithering and a lack of vision to hasten the erosion of Europe &apos;s foundations ? 
In this crisis , intention takes a back seat to action ( or lack thereof ) . 
The International Herald Tribunerecently quoted Winston Churchill : &quot; It &apos;s not enough that we do our best ; sometimes we have to do what &apos;s required . &quot; 
That is precisely the order of the day in Europe and the eurozone . 
What needs to be done has long been clear . 
The price of the monetary union &apos;s survival , and thus that of the European project , is more community : a banking union , fiscal union , and political union . 
Those who oppose this because they fear common accountability , transfers from rich to poor , and a loss of national sovereignty will have to accept Europe &apos;s re-nationalization - and thus its exit from the world stage . 
No alternative - and certainly not the statusquo - will work . 
It has become common knowledge in Europe that the ongoing crisis will either destroy the EU or bring about a political union , and that , without a solidarity-based solution to existing debt and a partial mutualization of new debt , the euro cannot be saved . 
Such steps will make far-reaching transfers of sovereignty unavoidable . 
Is Germany - or France - willing to do that ? 
The real crisis of the EU and the monetary union is not financial but political - or , more precisely , it is a leadership crisis . 
A lack of vision , courage , and strength of purpose is on display in all European capitals , but especially so in Berlin ( and on the part of government and opposition alike ) . 
Europe &apos;s national politicians routinely criticize the EU for its lack of democratic legitimacy , yet they bear part of the responsibility for it . 
Or have pro-Europeans become so faint-hearted and dejected that they prefer simply to hand over the reins to anti-European populists and nationalists ? 
That would be a disaster , because the crisis now runs too deep to be resolved by technocratic means . 
Germany is preparing for a national election in which - much like in last year &apos;s French presidential election - the European crisis is to play no part , or at least only a minor one . 
Both government and opposition believe that it would be better to tell the people the truth concerning the most vital question of the day only after the election ( and in measured doses ) . 
Such an outcome would make a mockery of democracy . 
But things may turn out very differently if the dynamics of Europe &apos;s crisis throw German politicians &quot; plans into disarray . 
An unpleasant surprise cannot be ruled out ; at this point , it might be Europe &apos;s greatest source of hope .
