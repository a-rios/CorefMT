Russia &apos;s Moving Presidential Target 
Recently , a small event caused a major stir in Russian politics . 
An aide to President Vladimir Putin , Igor Shuvalov , said that it was realistic to expect the appearance of a new person whom Putin would consider his potential successor . 
The statement hit like a bombshell , producing an explosion of comments . 
There is nothing strange in this . 
Russia &apos;s somewhat archaic political culture overly personifies power . 
Perceptions and assessments of the country &apos;s future often depend heavily on the personality of its leader , his resoluteness , and his intellectual and moral qualities . 
Furthermore , Putin himself is interested in preserving uncertainty with regard to his successor for as long as possible . 
By doing so , he avoids the damage to his authority that would be caused by becoming a &quot; lame duck , &quot; particularly given Russia &apos;s servile bureaucracy and its lack of reliable institutions and respected traditions to carry out a smooth transfer of power . 
Finally , different clans around the president have long been trying to promote their own candidates for succession . 
Statements similar to Shuvalov &apos;s have already been made , and more can be expected . 
This ongoing discussion of the various candidates &quot; merits and drawbacks recalls how airplanes protect themselves from missile attacks by launching a false target . 
Public interest is the missile , and the target is the &quot; ruling power , &quot; which protects itself by providing a decoy in the form of aimless talk . 
But a more fundamental question is why Russia &apos;s politicians , journalists , and analysts ( and even some in the West ) happily engage in this ruse . 
At the moment , who will succeed Putin is not important ; what counts is the process that will result in the choice of Russia &apos;s third president . 
The real historical significance of the choice that Russia will face in 2008 will be determined not by the next president &apos;s personal qualities , but by his loyalties - that is , to whom he owes his job . 
Putin &apos;s successor ( whoever that will be ) will come to power as a result of a deal within a narrow elite circle . 
This means that he will be accountable to and dependent on those who raised him to power , not in a symbolic sense , but in the quite real sense of fulfilling promises and facing sanctions if he does not . 
This narrow circle comprises not only very rich and resourceful people , but also members of informal but very effective organizations ( which are often , perhaps not entirely correctly , called &quot; mafia &quot; ) . 
Thus , the implementation of Operation Successor ( which may include the extension of the current president &apos;s term ) has imitated the way Putin himself came to power , and leaves Russia on the same path that Yeltsin set in the last years of his presidency - a path that will either ruin the country or bring it to a dead end . 
Politicians who come to power by winning a free and fair election are accountable primarily to voters . 
This does not necessarily lead them to work solely for the public good . 
Even winners of competitive elections have commitments to their campaign teams and sponsors . 
However , the existence of real political opposition creates a different atmosphere , which spreads beyond elections . 
Free elections do not determine politicians &quot; behavior , and do not necessarily ensure that moral , energetic , and intelligent people fill high offices . 
But freedom and democracy do restrict arbitrariness and theft , and encourage politicians , regardless of their moral qualities , to take public interests into account . 
If the next president comes to power by means of a free and fair election , Russia will have a real chance at a decent future . 
However , if Putin &apos;s successor - or Putin himself - is imposed on the country in an uncompetitive way , Russia will remain on its current path to nowhere . 
This is a critical moment for Russia . 
Unfortunately , what is most important to comprehend in this moment is barely recognized , much less discussed .
