The UN Heresy 
No other organization is held in such respect as the United Nations . 
This is perhaps natural , for the UN embodies some of humanity &apos;s noblest dreams . 
But , as the current scandal surrounding the UN &apos;s administration of the Iraq oil for food program demonstrates , and as the world remembers the Rwanda genocide that began ten years ago , respect for the UN should be viewed as something of a superstition , with Secretary General Kofi Annan its false prophet . 
Not since Dag Hammarskj√∂ld has a UN leader been as acclaimed as Annan . 
Up to a point , this is understandable . 
Annan usually maintains an unruffled , dignified demeanor . 
He has charm and - many say - charisma . 
But a leader ought to be judged by his or her actions when important matters are at stake . 
Annan &apos;s failures in such situations are almost invariably glossed over . 
Between 1993 and 1996 , Annan was Assistant Secretary-General for UN Peacekeeping Operations and then Under-Secretary-General . 
One of the two great disasters for which he bears a large share of the blame is the Serbian slaughter of 7,000 people in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica , perhaps the worst massacre in postwar Europe . 
In 1993 , Bosnia &apos;s Muslems were promised that UN forces would protect them . 
This commitment was a precondition of their consenting to disarm . 
The UN declared Srebrenica a &quot; safe haven &quot; to be &quot; protected &quot; by 600 Dutch UN troops . 
In July 1995 , Serb forces attacked . 
The UN did not honor its pledge . 
Annan &apos;s staff released evasive , confused statements . 
Oblivious , apparently , to the dreadfulness of the situation , they failed to sound the alarm properly and did nothing to intervene . 
The Dutch fired not a single shot . 
NATO air power could have halted the Serbs , but Annan did not ask for NATO intervention . 
Ratko Mladic , the Serb commander and war criminal , deported the women and children under the eyes of the UN , while capturing and murdering the men and adolescent boys . 
No one should be surprised by the UN &apos;s inaction , because only the year before it had demonstrated utter incompetence in facing the fastest genocide in history - the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in just 100 days . 
UN forces in Rwanda in 1994 were Annan &apos;s responsibility before and during the crisis . 
Annan was alerted four months before Hutu activists began their mass killings by a fax message from Romeo Dallaire , the Canadian general commanding UN forces in Rwanda . 
Dallaire described in detail how the Hutus were planning &quot; anti-Tutsi extermination . &quot; 
He identified his source &quot; a Hutu &quot; and reported that arms were ready for the impending ethnic cleansing . 
Dallaire requested permission to evacuate his informant and to seize the arms cache . 
Annan rejected both demands , proposing that Dallaire make the informant &apos;s identity known to Rwandan President Habyarimana , a Hutu , even though the informant had expressly named the President &apos;s closest entourage as the authors of the genocide blueprint . 
Annan maintained his extreme passiveness even after the airplane crash that killed Habyarimana , which signaled the genocide &apos;s start , helped by the indifference of the great powers ( America not least ) . 
One might think Annan far too compromised for the post of Secretary-General , but the UN doesn &apos;t work that way . 
Instead of being forced to resign after Rwanda and Srebrenica , he was promoted to Secretary-General . 
That is the culture of the UN : believe the best of barbarians , do nothing to provoke controversy among superiors , and let others be the butt of criticism afterwards . 
Even subsequent revelations about Annan &apos;s responsibility for the disasters in Rwanda and Bosnia did not affect his standing . 
On the contrary , he was unanimously re-elected and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . 
He is the all-time Teflon diplomat . 
The media sometimes ratchets up admiration for Annan by pointing out that his wife is Swedish and a close relative of Raoul Wallenberg . 
We are meant to infer that , on top of all his talents , Annan shares the ideals embodied during the last days of WWII by the foremost Swede of modern times . 
But Wallenberg &apos;s name should make us even more dismayed about Annan &apos;s record . 
Wallenberg refused to ignore the threat of massacres to come . 
Instead of ducking responsibility and carrying on with conventional work in Sweden , he made his way to Hungary , the scene of Hitler &apos;s last homicidal orgy against the Jews . 
In Budapest , Wallenberg exploited every available contact , resorting to shady tricks , bribes , and other stratagems to save as many people as possible from the Holocaust . 
He never allowed himself to be duped by Hitler &apos;s cronies . 
Perhaps no one &apos;s achievement should be judged by comparison with that of Wallenberg - a titan of strength , courage , and perseverance . 
The trouble with Annan is that , when similar perils loomed , he proved especially wanting . 
Annan cannot plead that he faced any risk to his personal safety , whereas Wallenberg in 1944 and 1945 was in constant peril . 
Nor can he possibly excuse himself by saying that no warnings were given , or that he lacked resources , or that he did not have the international position to intervene . 
Annan had at his disposal all of the instruments of power and opinion that Wallenberg lacked . 
Yet when thousands or hundreds of thousands of people were exposed to mortal threats that he had the authority and duty to avert , alleviate , or at least announce , he failed abjectly . 
Now , despite the recent revelations about briberies in the UN &apos;s oil-for-food program for Iraq , the world is clamoring to entrust Annan with the future of more than 20 million Iraqis who survived Saddam Hussein &apos;s depraved dictatorship .
