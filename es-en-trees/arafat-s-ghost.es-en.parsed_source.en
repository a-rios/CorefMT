Arafat \ u0027s Ghost 
History gave Yasir Arafat far more time than most leaders to achieve his mission . 
After all , at the time of his death he had been leader of the Palestinians for 35 years . 
Yet he left his people in a terrible situation , with no state , in the midst of a losing war , and with a bankrupt economy . 
Whether his successors can revive and complete the Palestinians &apos; historic mission depends on how they define their goal . 
Looking back at his career , Arafat never really veered from the belief that his life &apos;s mission was to destroy Israel by any means necessary and replace it with a Palestinian Arab state . 
An independent Palestinian state that did not include all of Israel held no appeal to him . 
He was equally indifferent to his people &apos;s material welfare and anything particular about the design of a viable political and economic system . 
Now , in the post-Arafat era , Palestinians must choose one of several strategies . 
Unfortunately , most of the alternatives call for the continued use of violence and terrorism . 
The moderate strategy seeks an independent Palestine state as quickly as possible , on the assumption that once there is no more Israeli presence or violence , the Palestinians can concentrate on constructive pursuits , including resettling refugees and improving living standards . 
If Arafat had taken this road - accepting Israel &apos;s existence , ending terrorism , and confronting Palestinian extremists - the conflict would have ended long ago . 
The

The militants argue that a two-stage strategy is needed to defeat Israel . 
First , long-term continuation of violence will force Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories . 
Then , with Palestinians gaining the upper hand , they can advance to a second stage in which all of Israel is conquered , implying armed struggle - which often takes the form of anti-civilian terrorism - for many more years . 
Finally , there is the 
The problem for Palestinian moderates is clear : any leader willing to agree a peace treaty with Israel would be opposed - passionately and even violently - by roughly 80 % of the movement . 
A key question is whether the Palestinian masses , fed up with their leadership &apos;s bickering , corruption , and incompetence , could make their wishes known to find an end to a conflict that has cost them so much . 
Moreover , the popular appeal of radical religion , ideology , and misinformation should not be underestimated . 
Few Palestinians are even aware that four years ago Arafat turned down an independent state equal in size to the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip , in addition to more than $ 20 billion in refugee compensation . 
The main problem left by Arafat is the lack of any leadership at all . 
Rarely in history has a political movement been so deliberately set by its founder on a course toward chaos . 
Arafat not only left no successor , but no order . 
Over the decades , the movement has developed a political culture of indiscipline . 
Arafat presided over a sort of anarchy , encouraging rivalries , undermining other potential leaders , and ensuring that all authority ( and money ) ran through his hands . 
Only if the post-Arafat movement decides that it really wants a Palestinian state in exchange for ending the conflict with Israel in every respect will there be a real chance of peace . 
Arafat &apos;s death may well mark the beginning of that process , but the transition to a new Palestinian leadership could take years , and there is no assurance that it will be a moderate one .
