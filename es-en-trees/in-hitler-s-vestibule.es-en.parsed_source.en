In Hitler \ u0027s Vestibule 
You feel uneasy the moment you enter Jan Zakrzewski &apos;s &quot; Sky over Poznan &quot; exhibition ( opening April 28 at Kunstlerhaus Bethanien in Berlin and running until May 23 ) . 
The room is small , somehow narrow . 
Two big mirrors form a sort of corridor . 
Once the space served as a vestibule , but , given the room &apos;s historic function , perhaps it should be called an antechamber - a place watched over by an armed guard or servant . 
Unauthorized people would never be allowed to enter . 
With good reason . 
That room was designed as a residence in case the FÃ¼hrer ever chose to visit Poznan , then part of the former Kingdom of Prussia , having been absorbed in the second partition of Poland in 1793 . 
On the eve of World War I , in 1913 , Kaiser Wilhelm II built Poznan castle . 
At the beginning of World War II , Albert Speer converted the Castle &apos;s chapel into a residence for his master . 
The office was ready for occupancy in 1943 just before the Battle of Stalingrad - and just after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising . 
Hitler , however , never visited . 
When in Prussia , he preferred his &quot; Wolf &apos;s Lair &quot; forest headquarters . 
The city of Poznan is located mid-way between Warsaw and Berlin , and Zakrzewski sees it as the symbolic frontier between East and West , Germany and Poland . 
In that vestibule , you feel yourself in no man &apos;s land . 
On the eastern and western walls hang two large mirrors , covered by historically explosive expressions from both nations , each translated as well into the opposite , rival language . 
So you read slogans like &quot; Arbeit macht frei &quot; or &quot; Gott mit uns &quot; in Polish , as well as Polish jingoistic sayings , such as &quot; Poland for Poles &quot; or &quot; Lithuania , my fatherland , &quot; in German . 
National and cultural identities are mixed ; xenophobia and rage mirror xenophobia and rage . 
While reading those infamous expressions in a foreign language , you also observe your own reflection in the mirror . 
You see yourself doubled : your face and front are seen in the mirror you are facing ; your back is reflected in the opposite mirror , reflected twice , actually , for the image you see before you is also there behind you . 
You are and you are not complicit . 
In the end , you feel yourself in a tunnel of multiplied reflections where you lose any sense of reality . 
Happily , or so you think , reality returns in the sound of two radio broadcasts : Polish and German . 
But that return is also a fake because the two broadcasts deal with two different realities : Polish and German . 
How close is the content of those broadcasts , you wonder , to the slogans you have been reading ? 
Then you enter Hitler &apos;s residence . 
The main space is almost invisible . 
In the darkness , your footsteps become uneasy . 
Then you see equally small white spots glittering from black space over your head . 
If you are good at astronomy , you can recognize the constellations typical of the sky over Poznan . 
Here we are : the exhibition title is exactly the same : &quot; Sky over Poznan . &quot; 
You guess that the bubble spots under your feet might be a symbolic &quot; mirror reflection &quot; of the sky . 
But you are wrong . 
You are stepping on a &quot; war map &quot; made from bullet tracings and pockmarks that still exist on some buildings . 
This &quot; map &quot; was made from the walls of two different buildings : one from Chmielna Street in Warsaw , the other from Grosse Hamburger Strasse in Berlin - a reality less distant than the stars . 
From some points of view , the borderlines are the most important part of the exhibition - as also happens in reality . 
Borders define the limits of so many things : laws , languages , economies . 
They also mark the limits of culture and national identity . 
To help us recognize how quickly and how often the borders between Germany and Poland changed over the last millennium , Zakrzewski recreates them in neon tubes that change shape as often as the real borders changed . 
The borders transformed into neon rise up from transparent jars like flower bunches on both sides of the bubbled floor . 
What is produced are sensations of change , not an examination of the historical changes of a millennium . 
Indeed , examination is not the purpose of the exhibition . 
For perhaps the most important thing to know is that - here and now - we have the same sky over our heads as all those who died in the war , as well as those who incited their deaths with their demented dreams . 
Then you exit . 
The corridor leading to Heaven , which Zakrzewski calls purgatory . 
Given what you have seen , purgatory also seems to lead to Hell .
