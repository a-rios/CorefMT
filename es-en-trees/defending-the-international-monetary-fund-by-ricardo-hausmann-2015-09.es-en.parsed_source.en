Don &apos;t Fear the IMF 
CAMBRIDGE - The International Monetary Fund is , in many places , the organization that everybody loves to hate . 
According to some , the IMF is bad for the poor , women , economic stability , and the environment . 
Joseph Stiglitz , whose influence is amplified by his Nobel Prize , blames the IMF for causing and then worsening the economic crises it was called on to resolve . 
The IMF purportedly does so to save capitalists and bankers , not ordinary people . 
Though untrue , this belief does enormous harm and limits the potential good that the IMF can do . 
For starters , consider how the world deals with refugee crises , such as Syria &apos;s , and the way it deals with financial crises . 
As its name indicates , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is a person , not an institution . 
This weakness is what forced German Chancellor Angela Merkel to bully her European Union partners into a more coherent response to the ongoing influx of asylum-seekers . 
By contrast , the system to prevent and resolve financial crises is anchored by a full-fledged institution : the IMF . 
It may not be perfect , but , compared to areas such as refugees , human rights , or the environment , it is light-years ahead . 
It is easy to misunderstand what the IMF does . 
The bulk of its efforts are dedicated to crisis prevention . 
As Franklin D. Roosevelt said at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference , where the IMF and the World Bank were established , &quot; Economic diseases are highly communicable . 
It follows , therefore , that the economic health of every country is a proper matter of concern to all its neighbors , near and distant . &quot; 
That is why the 44 countries in attendance , and the 188 that now belong to the IMF , agreed to &quot; consult and agree on international monetary changes which affect each other ... and they should assist each other to overcome short-term exchange difficulties . &quot; 
Operationally , this is expressed in so-called Article IV consultations . 
These formal policy discussions between the IMF and member governments , typically carried out annually , are written up , reviewed by the Fund &apos;s Board of Executive Directors ( representing all 188 governments ) , and published for anyone to read online . 
This is a standard of collective surveillance and transparency to which organizations addressing other issues should aspire . 
The IMF has been instrumental in developing the tools with which countries measure , assess , and improve their current macroeconomic position : fiscal and monetary policy , as well as financial , currency , and price stability . 
It helps countries find better ways to implement measures in all of these fields , and it seeks to identify broad lessons from the experience of many countries that may shed light on the options that any particular country has . 
Through dialogue , research , advice , technical assistance , and training , the IMF has helped create a global community of practice . 
Today , it is much easier to be a central bank president or a finance minister than it is to be a minister of health or justice . 
This is not because the challenges are easier , but because the international community of practice , led by the IMF , provides a level of support that simply does not exist in other areas . 
The IMF &apos;s most controversial activities come during times of crisis management and resolution . 
Countries ask for IMF financial assistance when they are in trouble and have lost or fear losing the ability to borrow on international markets . 
The IMF can mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars of member countries &quot; money to give borrowers the time to get back on their feet . 
Its resources dwarf the sums that the international community can mobilize for other issues , because its money is lent and is supposed to be paid back . 
In exchange for its financial support , the IMF typically requires countries to address the imbalances that caused their problems , not only so that they can repay the money , but also for their own good , so that they can restore their creditworthiness ( and hence their access to capital markets ) . 
But it is too easy to confuse the pain caused by the crisis itself with that caused by the remedy . 
To be sure , the IMF inevitably makes mistakes , partly because the questions and issues it must address are constantly changing , so that it never knows whether the current state of thinking is adequate to new challenges . 
But it is a sufficiently open organization that it can and must be responsive to its critics . 
Now consider the alternative . 
A world without the IMF looks a lot like today &apos;s Venezuela . 
Hugo Ch√°vez became the darling of IMF bashers , including Stiglitz , when he suspended Article IV consultations in 2004 . 
As a consequence , Venezuelans lost access to the basic economic information that the country is obligated to share , through the IMF , with the world . 
The break prevented the international community from expressing its voice as the country undertook truly irresponsible policies , spending in 2012 as if the price of oil was $ 197 a barrel , not $ 107 . 
With the collapse in the price of oil since then , the economy has gone into a tailspin : GDP is contracting at a record pace , inflation is in excess of 200 % , the currency has plunged to less than 10 % of its previous value , and massive shortages have emerged . 
Venezuela has tried to finance itself with the help of the China Development Bank , which does not impose the kind of conditionality that IMF bashers dislike . 
Instead , the CDB lends on secret terms , for uses that are undisclosed and corrupt , and with built-in privileges for Chinese companies in areas like telecommunications ( Huawei ) , appliances ( Haier ) , cars ( Chery ) , and oil drilling ( ICTV ) . 
The Chinese have not required that Venezuela do anything to increase the likelihood that it regains creditworthiness . 
Whatever the IMF &apos;s faults , the CDB is a disgrace . 
The tragedy is that most Venezuelans ( and many citizens of other countries ) believe that the IMF is there to hurt , not help . 
As a consequence , they eschew the massive resources and wisdom that the international community can offer at a time of economic crisis to lessen the pain and hasten recovery . 
That has left them far worse off than the IMF bashers can bring themselves to admit .
