An Alternative to Deposit Insurance 
Argentina &apos;s financial panic and the run on its banks that ensued , as well as Asia &apos;s financial crisis of 1997 , have forced a number of countries to consider adopting deposit insurance schemes to protect their citizens &apos; savings . 
But is deposit insurance the best defense against bank panics ? 
Deposit insurance was a response to banking crises of the type that plagued the United States until the 1930 &apos;s . 
The first explicit scheme was introduced in America after the Great Depression and initially seemed an unmitigated success . 
Panics no longer occurred , which stabilized the financial system and contributed to sustained post-war economic growth . 
Deposit insurance did away with financial panics because bank runs are typically driven by a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
They occur when a bank &apos;s clients fear that most of their fellow depositors will withdraw their funds . 
Because banks service their depositors on a first-come-first-served basis , those who wait risk being left empty-handed , because the bank may be forced to liquidate its long term-assets at a loss and run out of resources . 
So fear of a panic can create a panic . 
This is highly inefficient , because while it is individually rational for depositors to want their money immediately , the bank might have been able to service all of them had they been collectively patient . 
Economists call such situations &quot; coordination failures , &quot; if depositors could talk to each other and coordinate their actions , they would be able to avoid a self-defeating run on the bank . 
By guaranteeing that there will be enough resources available for patient clients when they want to withdraw their funds , deposit insurance eliminates the coordination failure . 
Patient depositors no longer need to worry about others withdrawing their funds because it has no effect on them . 
But deposit insurance leads to other problems , which first appeared with the Savings and Loan crisis in the US during the 1980 &apos;s . 
Deposit insurance creates what economists call &quot; moral hazard , &quot; people who are insured against an unpleasant event are not as careful as they would otherwise be in trying to avoid that event . 
If my bicycle is insured against theft , I might buy a cheaper lock for it , making it more likely that it will be stolen . 
With deposit insurance , clients who no longer risk losing their money have no incentive to monitor their bank , while banks , with no one watching , have incentives to invest in excessively risky projects . 
Although many factors contributed to the Savings and Loan crisis , it is generally agreed that moral hazard was a major one . 
Following that crisis , deposit insurance in the US was reformed with the objective of mitigating the moral hazard problem . But did the reforms go far enough ? There are ways to improve the existing system , but is something altogether different and better possible ? As far back as 1873 , in his classic book on central banking , 
In case of panic , a good policy should help banks that have enough assets to cover their deposits but that can &apos;t pay all depositors at the same time because some assets are tied up in real estate or other long-term investments . 
These banks are 
In contrast to deposit insurance , however , liquidity provision can avoid moral hazard by helping 
Consider a bank that has invested in risky projects and finds itself in trouble . 
It can ask the central bank for help and sell some of its assets for cash . 
However , under the agreement with the central bank , it must buy its assets back . 
If the assets are worthless , it will ultimately be forced out of business . 
If it declares bankruptcy and refuses to buy back its assets , bankruptcy laws should give the central bank the first claim on the bank &apos;s assets . 
This creates a powerful incentive for depositors and investors to monitor their bank &apos;s performance . 
Implementing liquidity provision policies like those advocated by Bagehot would prevent bank panics without the incentive for undue risk-taking associated with deposit insurance . 
Depositors deserve strong , effective protection for their funds - and the banking system requires it in order to maintain confidence . 
But neither depositors nor their banks should be given a free ride .
