The Indian Tortoise and the Chinese Hare 
&quot; India everywhere &quot; was the theme at this year &apos;s World Economic Forum . 
In the West , there is so much focus on China that India &apos;s achievements are often acknowledged only as an afterthought . 
As if to underscore the point that political stability must triumph in the long run , the Indians plastered Swiss buses with the banner : &quot; India : The World &apos;s Fastest Growing Democracy . &quot; 
The India media blitz was a huge success . 
In Davos , speaker after speaker touted the idea that even if China is ahead now , over the longer run , the race between Asia &apos;s two giants is a toss-up . 
For a few days at least , India &apos;s emergence as a superpower on par with China was taken as a fait accompli . 
But what is the reality in the race between economies with more than a billion people each ? 
On the surface , China has opened up quite a lead on India . 
Twenty-five years ago , at the start of the contemporary wave of globalization , national output in India and China was about the same . 
Now , by any measure , China is more than twice as rich . 
But the real difference is not so much that successful Chinese are doing better than successful Indians . 
After all , the Indian elite are world-beaters , as Lakshmi Mittal &apos;s bold $ 22 billion bid for French steelmaker Arcelor shows . 
No , the real difference - whether we like to admit it or not - is that China &apos;s communist government has succeeded in globalizing a much larger share of its population than India &apos;s democratic government has managed to do . 
Not that China is exactly egalitarian . 
It is only along the coast , home to roughly one in three Chinese citizens , that most people can be said to have really joined the twenty-first century . 
Much of rural China is still miserable , with 150 million people effectively unemployed and health and education standards often befitting an earlier century . 
But caste-bound India &apos;s record of exclusion is worse . 
Perhaps only one in five persons are integrated into the global economy . 
For every call center employee , there are many more people still eking out a subsistence living on the land . 
Whereas China probably has about 450 million people in its globalized economy , India has at most 200-250 million . 
It is this difference , more than anything else , that sets the two economies apart . 
What can India do to close the gap ? 
Its biggest shortcoming is its lack of roads , bridges , ports , and other infrastructure , where the contrast with China is just stunning . 
If your products can &apos;t get to the global economy , you cannot conquer it . 
Over the past five years , China has multiplied its highway system five-fold . 
Its 50,000 kilometers of new roads are built to handle even large aircraft , which is more than one can say about some of the runways at India &apos;s shambolic airports . 
It is not just a matter of money - India &apos;s central bank is rolling in cash , which it has mainly invested in low-yield foreign treasury bills . 
The real problem is that China &apos;s authoritarian system faces little opposition when it decides to bulldoze a shantytown that stands in the way of a new airport . 
India &apos;s government , by contrast , has neither the power nor the inclination to trample over poor people to make rich people richer . 
Unfortunately , without infrastructure , the 800 million-plus Indians who have not yet &quot; made it &quot; don &apos;t have a chance . 
India will never be able to create enough jobs in services alone ; it must be able to compete in low-end manufacturing areas as well . 
Without better infrastructure , the majority of India &apos;s citizens will remain frozen out of globalization . 
So , is the idea that India &apos;s economy could overtake China &apos;s hopeless romanticism ? 
Not necessarily , if only because the areas where India excels , notably services , have far higher potential margins than manufacturing . 
Here , the Chinese , hampered by a vastly inferior legal system , will not be able to compete easily . 
Western companies are far more inclined to trust Indian firms with sensitive financial information or patents than they are in the case of China . 
Foreign companies know that if they outsource any high-tech process to China , they might as well publish their blueprints on the Internet . 
India also has a much better developed financial system than China , an advantage that will be increasingly important as the two countries develop . 
Command and control financing ( &quot; directed lending , &quot; as economists call it ) works well when it comes to building bridges ; it is a lot less effective when it comes to choosing what companies deserve to survive . 
The challenge for the Indians , and , indeed , for other emerging markets like Brazil , Russia , and Mexico , is that they need to find ways to broaden the successful sectors of their economies without strangling them . 
If India is to ever catch up with China , it must globalize more of its citizens , through better provision of health , education and infrastructure . 
Only then will we truly start seeing &quot; India everywhere . &quot;
