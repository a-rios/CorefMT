Water Wars . 
What is more vital for the future of humanity - and life in general - than water ? 
Water abounds in nature , and most of humanity will have lived more than ten millenniums without ever wondering about it . 
We draw it , use it , throw it away , most often back into rivers or oceans . 
When one considers the fights we are capable of having over oil , one shudders to imagine where a lack of water could lead . 
While Latin America seems well endowed , the situation is very different elsewhere . 
Europe is nearing its limits , and water scarcity is already a pressing issue in Africa , Central Asia , and China . 
Over the last 20 or 30 years we have begun to comprehend what is at stake , owing to initiatives like the World Water Forum , which held its fourth annual meeting in March . 
Unfortunately , the Forum is not yet an official body and has no decision-making power . 
Water management is an inherently difficult challenge , and experience counts for a lot . 
Practice shows that local levels of government provide the most efficient water management , even if regulations must necessarily be national in scope . 
Nor do most states seem prepared to start a real dialogue over water policy with civil society groups . 
At one extreme of exclusion , for example , consider that decisions about water management are largely taken by men , though in most of the world it is women who use the water . 
Moreover , interference is constant , and inevitable , between the public and the private sectors . 
A subtle mix of official regulation and private contracting is required . 
The multiplicity of interlocutors inevitably creates a multiplicity of water systems with vastly unequal levels of efficiency . 
Initiatives like the World Water Forums thus inevitably highlight debates about what constitutes good water management , as well as elaborating useful concepts . 
One casualty of such debates has been the myth that water is free . 
Water has a cost , and someone , either end-users or taxpayers , has to pay it . 
It is possible , of course , to envision sharing the costs , but it is no longer possible not to charge for water . 
The most recent World Water Forum debated two issues that will confront policymakers in the years ahead . 
The first concerns the so-called &quot; right to water . &quot; 
The urgency of the needs , with a billion people lacking access to drinking water and two billion without proper sewer systems , together with the vast number of diseases that result , underscore the need to recognize such a fundamental human right . 
A consensus was reached at the Forum that such a right makes sense only if it is formulated in such a way that particular policymaking entities , be they water companies or local governments , face an affirmative duty to respect this right . 
Only the state can be made responsible here . 
The state must be charged with ensuring an effective water system that meets the basic needs of all , but the balance of this system remains to be defined . 
These uncertainties , indeed , led the Forum to avoid acknowledging a formal right to water in its final resolution . 
The second issue concerned the role of local authorities . 
Despite the political and administrative centralization of most of the countries represented at the Forum , there was widespread agreement that the most efficient water systems are managed as close as possible to the resource and its users . 
Agreement on this provided a real breakthrough for the future of water policy . 
Naturally , conflicts among governments or local authorities and private enterprises resurfaced . 
Inevitably , the cruel lack of means was pointed out time and again . 
As we grapple with our joint water future , we will face a time of trial and error in finding workable solutions . 
We should all drink to that .
