China &apos;s North Korean Pivot 
BEIJING - After a spring of heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula , a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks has brought some hope of a meeting of the minds , at least between China , South Korea , and the United States . 
But the emergence of a viable consensus on how to minimize the security risks emanating from North Korea &apos;s mercurial leadership remains to be found . 
After a reportedly tough meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Vice Marshall Choe Ryong-hae , one of the four members of North Korea &apos;s ruling presidium , the US-China summit in California took place with North Korea as one of the central points of discussion . 
This was quickly followed by a Beijing summit between Xi and South Korean President Park Geun-hye . 
The fact that Xi participated in all three meetings underscores two truths : China &apos;s policy toward North Korea is the key to a solution to the problems posed by North Korea , and China may be actively searching for a new approach to its wayward ally . 
China &apos;s interest in a new North Korea policy is not entirely new . 
After all , China &apos;s policy toward the country has been gradually moving in a more constructive direction for the past two decades , reflecting China &apos;s growing international prominence , as well as its leaders &quot; cautious embrace of the global role that their country &apos;s new economic might has provided . 
In the immediate post-Cold War period , China cooperated with other concerned parties in the process of resolving the first North Korea nuclear crisis of 1993-1994 ; but it tended to regard the North &apos;s nuclear ambitions mainly as a bilateral issue between North Korea and the US . 
President Bill Clinton seemed to agree , and adopted a bilateral approach to the nuclear crisis , which resulted in the two countries &quot; Agreed Framework of 1994 . 
But China upgraded its role in the 2000 &quot; s . 
After North Korea &apos;s enriched uranium program triggered another crisis in late 2002 , President George W. Bush wanted to mobilize China &apos;s influence in a more systematic way . 
Though Chinese leaders became more active by hosting the six-party talks , they still regarded their role as that of mediator between the US and the North , rather than that of a party whose security interests were seriously affected by events on the Korean Peninsula . 
Immediately after the North &apos;s second nuclear test in 2009 , Chinese officials undertook a review of their country &apos;s North Korea policy and decided to separate the nuclear issue from the overall bilateral relationship . 
Thus , former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited Pyongyang in October 2009 and promised generous economic aid . 
Chinese leaders may have believed that inducing the North to adopt the Chinese model of economic opening would create a better political environment for denuclearization . 
One result was a deepening of North Korea &apos;s economic dependence on China . 
But the big problem was that the North &apos;s leadership apparently interpreted China &apos;s policy as a sign of unwillingness to pressure the North on nuclear matters . 
Indeed , North Korean behavior became much more provocative , including an attack in 2010 that sank the South Korean corvette Cheonan and another in which the South &apos;s Yeonpyeong Island was shelled . 
Following this spring &apos;s round of North Korean provocations , Xi appears to have concluded that enough is enough . 
As a result , China &apos;s North Korea policy has entered a new stage . 
Xi &apos;s criticism of the North &apos;s nuclear ambitions has become both unusually public and blunt . 
Chinese leaders may still view North Korea as a strategic buffer state , but China &apos;s status as a global power is pushing them to view the North in a new way . 
Former State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan was even reported to have said recently that denuclearization is now a higher priority for China than stabilization of the Korean Peninsula . 
This approach should favor China &apos;s global strategy , which is premised upon Xi &apos;s desire to build a new type of &quot; major power &quot; relationship between China and the US ( the Chinese government prefers &quot; major power &quot; to &quot; great power , &quot; probably in order to highlight its stated renunciation of hegemonic ambition ) . 
Indeed , among the myriad unresolved issues dividing the US and China , North Korea &apos;s nuclear program is the one most likely to impede mutual trust . 
If the US and China are to avoid being steered by North Korea onto a collision course , they probably have four or five years to pursue a joint strategy - a timetable established by the point at which North Korea could have the technology to load miniaturized nuclear warheads atop long-range missiles . 
As the North approaches this point , the US will have to strengthen its missile defenses in the western Pacific - areas close to China - in order to deter the North Korean threat . 
The result , invariably , will be heightened Sino-US tension . 
China has no interest in such an outcome . 
The long-term costs of a worsening security confrontation with the US would exceed the short-term tactical benefits to be derived from continuing to support the North as a buffer state , especially given China &apos;s deepening relationship with South Korea . 
Though Park &apos;s visit to Beijing has not closed the gap between the Chinese and South Korean approaches to the North Korean nuclear issue , it does seem to have prepared the ground for closer coordination between the two governments . 
Those improved ties matter , because the time has come for China to rebalance its traditional geostrategic interests with its role as a global leader . 
That calls for a Chinese policy of disciplined engagement toward North Korea , without which an internationally coordinated solution to the nuclear problem - and , with it , the promise of more productive relations with the US and South Korea - will be impossible .
