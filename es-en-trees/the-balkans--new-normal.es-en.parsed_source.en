The Balkans &quot; New Normal 
SOFIA - The Balkans is the European Union &apos;s untold success story . 
The EU &apos;s commitment to bringing the region within its borders remains firm . 
In September , Catherine Ashton , the EU &apos;s High Representative for Foreign Affairs , succeeded in breaking the deadlock in Serbia-Kosovo relations by bringing both sides back to the negotiating table . 
The EU &apos;s soft power remains as visible as ever . 
Moreover , just this month , the visa wall surrounding the region for the last two decades finally fell for everyone ( with the exception of the Kosovo Albanians ) . 
It is as if the crisis in the EU &apos;s center had not reached its Balkan periphery . 
This , at least , is how the European Commission wants to see the Balkans , and how the region wants to present itself . 
But the reality is less re-assuring . 
A closer look reveals that the Balkans currently is a mixture of Greek-style economic problems , Berlusconi-style politics , and Turkish-style enthusiasm when it comes to the EU &apos;s will to integrate the countries of the region . 
To understand this mixture , imagine a rainy election day in an unnamed country , and that almost three-quarters of the ballots are returned blank . 
The government demands that the elections be re-held , when the sun is shining . 
The result is terrifying : the protest increases , with 83 % of the electorate voting without choosing a candidate . 
That is the plot of Jos√© Saramago &apos;s novel Seeing - an anti-utopian vision of post-political democracies where people are angry , the elite are conspiracy-minded and insecure , and social life is paralyzed . 
It is also a fair depiction of how citizens in the Balkans feel about their new political systems . 
Saramago &apos;s anywhere is the Balkans &quot; everywhere . 
When asked by the latest Gallup Balkan Monitor poll to say whom they trust , most respondents expressed faith in the Church , the EU , and the United Nations , but were deeply suspicious of national institutions , including those that are elected . 
Ten years after the last war in the region , the Balkans still comprises an assemblage of frustrated protectorates and weak states . 
Bosnia and Kosovo are trapped in the labyrinth of the politics of semi-independence ; 
Albania , Montenegro , and Macedonia are small and claustrophobic republics with populist and divisive governments and opposition forces that are discouraged and discouraging at the same time . 
Serbia has lost Kosovo , but it still has not found itself , while Croats are split over joining the EU , with a majority planning to vote against it . 
Serbs and Croats still disagree about history , but many agree that paying taxes is a waste of money , and most agree that no party or politician expresses their views . 
The EU has lost its magic , but it has not yet lost its importance . 
True , faced with the choice of keeping the constitutional name of their country or compromising with Greece for the benefit of joining the Union , Macedonians are sticking to their guns . 
Serbs also say that it is more important to pretend that Kosovo is part of Serbia than it is to join the EU . 
But declarations are one thing and reality is another . 
It is clear that if the region &apos;s citizens are to have any realistic hope of a better life and political stability , it will be related to their country &apos;s EU prospects . 
People from the region still believe in the EU , but they are not sure that the EU believes in itself . 
Moreover , they no longer know how their economies will be able to grow in post-crisis Europe . 
Previously , there were two models for small economies seeking to incorporate themselves within the EU : the Irish model of radical market reforms , and the Greek model of creative bookkeeping and absorption of European funds . 
Now both models have derailed . 
The impact of the EU &apos;s current crisis in the Balkans can be best understood as a crisis of political imagination . 
Just two or three years ago , people in the region worried about living on the outskirts of Europe ; now they worry about Europe itself . 
Once it was popular to tell Macedonians that they could become another Belgium . 
Now , one has to ask if Macedonians should want that outcome , given the wasteful and complicated way in which Belgium functions today . 
Indeed , no one promises that Belgium will not collapse in the next 10 or 20 years . 
How will the Balkans &quot; multicultural institutions , built after a decade of war and fervent nationalism , be sustained at a time when leading European politicians are heard to say that multiculturalism is dead ? 
How can institutional arrangements established to stop the war be transformed into an effective guarantee for a common future that includes EU membership ? 
Focused on their own problems , Europeans do not have time to think about how the crisis in the EU impacts the countries on Europe &apos;s periphery . 
This should change . 
The Balkans &quot; &quot; new normality &quot; is very much a reflection of Europe &apos;s .
