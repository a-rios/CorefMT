Emerging Economies on Their Own 
NEW YORK - There was a remarkable similarity between European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s statement after a recent meeting of the ECB Governing Council and US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen &apos;s first testimony to Congress : both asserted that their policy decisions would take into account only domestic conditions . 
In other words , emerging-market countries , though subject to significant spillover effects from advanced economies &quot; monetary policies , are on their own . 
This confirms what emerging-country authorities have known for a while . 
In 2010 - following the Fed &apos;s announcement of a third round of quantitative easing - Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega accused advanced countries of waging a global &quot; currency war . &quot; 
After all , advanced economies &quot; policies were driving large and volatile capital flows into the major emerging markets , pushing up their exchange rates and damaging their export competitiveness - a phenomenon that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff later referred to as a &quot; capital tsunami . &quot; 
Recently , the impact of the advanced economies &quot; withdrawal of monetary stimulus has been just as strong . 
Since last May , when the Fed announced its intention to begin tapering its asset purchases , capital has become less accessible and more expensive for emerging economies - a shift that has been particularly painful for countries whose large current-account deficits leave them dependent on foreign finance . 
In response , Raghuram Rajan , Governor of the Reserve Bank of India , has called advanced-country policies &quot; selfish , &quot; declaring that &quot; international monetary cooperation has broken down . &quot; 
To be sure , emerging economies have plenty of their own problems to address . 
But there is no denying that these countries have been victims of advanced economies &quot; monetary policies , which have increased capital-flow volatility over the last three decades . 
According to the International Monetary Fund &apos;s April 2011 World Economic Outlook , though the volatility of capital flows has increased worldwide , it is higher in emerging market economies than in advanced economies . 
Boom-bust financial cycles are driven largely by shocks generated in advanced economies , but they are key determinants of emerging markets &quot; business cycles . 
Moreover , the spillover effects of advanced economies &quot; monetary policies extend beyond financial shocks . 
Emerging economies are also suffering from the effects of developed countries &quot; external imbalances - particularly the eurozone &apos;s swelling current-account surplus . 
In the last few years , the deficit economies of the eurozone &apos;s periphery - and , more recently , Italy - have undertaken massive external adjustments , while Germany and the Netherlands have sustained their large surpluses . 
As a result , the burden of offsetting the eurozone &apos;s rising surplus has fallen largely on emerging economies , contributing to their growth slowdown . 
Such spillover effects are precisely what international policy cooperation - such as the &quot; mutual assessment process &quot; that the G-20 established in 2009 - was supposed to prevent . 
The IMF has created an elaborate system of multilateral surveillance of major countries &quot; macroeconomic policies , including the &quot; consolidated multilateral surveillance reports , &quot; the spillover reports for the so-called &quot; systemic five &quot; ( the US , the United Kingdom , the eurozone , Japan , and China ) , and the &quot; external sector reports &quot; assessing global imbalances . 
But this system has proved to be utterly ineffective in preventing spillovers - not least because the Fed and the ECB simply ignore it . 
Given that the US dollar and the euro are the top two international reserve currencies , spillovers should be considered the new normal . 
Adding insult to injury , the $ 1.1 trillion appropriations bill for federal-government operations agreed last month by the US Congress does not include any money to recapitalize the IMF , the main instrument of international monetary cooperation . 
That decision represents yet another setback for IMF reforms aimed at increasing the influence of emerging economies . 
Given the considerable benefits that stable and prosperous emerging countries bring to the world economy - exemplified by the role that they played in propping up global growth in the wake of the recent crisis - it is in everyone &apos;s interest to change the status quo . 
The G-20 and the IMF &apos;s International Monetary and Financial Committee must work to align reality with the rhetoric of macroeconomic-policy cooperation . 
For that , the recent statements by Draghi and Yellen should be treated as ground zero .
