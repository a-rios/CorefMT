Developing Countries and the Global Crisis 
NEW YORK - This year is likely to be the worst for the global economy since World War II , with the World Bank estimating a decline of up to 2 % . 
Even developing countries that did everything right - and had far better macroeconomic and regulatory policies than the United States did - are feeling the impact . 
Largely as a result of a precipitous fall in exports , China is likely to continue to grow , but at a much slower pace than the 11-12 % annual growth of recent years . 
Unless something is done , the crisis will throw as many as 200 million additional people into poverty . 
This global crisis requires a global response , but , unfortunately , responsibility for responding remains at the national level . 
Each country will try to design its stimulus package to maximize the impact on its own citizens - not the global impact . 
In assessing the size of the stimulus , countries will balance the cost to their own budgets with the benefits in terms of increased growth and employment for their own economies . 
Since some of the benefit ( much of it in the case of small , open economies ) will accrue to others , stimulus packages are likely to be smaller and more poorly designed than they otherwise would be , which is why a globally coordinated stimulus package is needed . 
This is one of several important messages to emerge from a United Nations Experts Commission on the global economic crisis , which I chair - and which recently submitted its preliminary report to the UN . 
The report supports many of the G-20 initiatives , but it urges stronger measures focused on developing countries . 
For instance , while it is recognized that almost all countries need to undertake stimulus measures ( we &apos;re all Keynesians now ) , many developing countries do not have the resources to do so . 
But if we are to avoid winding up in another debt crisis , some , perhaps much , of the money will have to be given in grants . 
And , in the past , assistance has been accompanied by extensive &quot; conditions , &quot; some of which enforced contractionary monetary and fiscal policies - just the opposite of what is needed now - and imposed financial deregulation , which was among the root causes of the crisis . 
In many parts of the world , there is a strong stigma associated with going to the International Monetary Fund , for obvious reasons . 
The sources of liquid funds today are in Asia and the Middle East , but why should these countries contribute money to organizations in which their voice is limited and which have often pushed policies that are antithetical to their values and beliefs ? 
Many of the governance reforms proposed for the IMF and the World Bank - affecting , most obviously , how their heads are chosen - finally seem to be on the table . 
It is thus imperative that assistance be provided through a variety of channels , in addition to , or instead of , the IMF , including regional institutions . 
New lending facilities could be created , with governance structures more consonant with the twenty-first century . 
If this could be done quickly ( which I think it could ) , such facilities could be an important channel for disbursing funds . 
At their November 2008 summit the G-20 leaders strongly condemned protectionism and committed themselves not to engage in it . 
Unfortunately , a World Bank study notes that 17 of the 20 countries have actually undertaken new protectionist measures , most notably the US with the &quot; buy American &quot; provision included in its stimulus package . 
But it has long been recognized that subsidies can be just as destructive as tariffs - and even less fair , since rich countries can better afford them . 
If there was ever a level playing field in the global economy , it no longer exists : the massive subsidies and bailouts provided by the US have changed everything , perhaps irreversibly . 
Indeed , even firms in advanced industrial countries that have not received a subsidy are at an unfair advantage . 
They can undertake risks that others cannot , knowing that if they fail , they may be bailed out . 
While one can understand the domestic political imperatives that have led to subsidies and guarantees , developed countries need to recognize the global consequences , and provide compensatory assistance to developing countries . 
One of the more important medium-term initiatives urged by the UN Commission is the creation of a global economic coordinating council , which would not only coordinate economic policy , but would also assess impending problems and institutional gaps . 
As the downturn deepens , several countries may , for example , face bankruptcy . 
And the US dollar reserve-currency system - the backbone of the current global financial system - is fraying . 
China has expressed concerns , and the head of its central bank has joined the UN Commission in calling for a new global reserve system . 
The UN Commission argues that addressing this old issue - raised more than 75 years ago by Keynes - is essential if we are to have a robust and stable recovery . 
Such reforms will not occur overnight .
