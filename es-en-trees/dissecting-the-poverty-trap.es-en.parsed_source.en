Dissecting the Poverty Trap 
Without exception , population growth in rich countries has slowed to a crawl . 
Average fertility rates in Europe and North America , for example , have fallen to 1.5 to 3 births per woman . 
By contrast , average fertility rates in the world &apos;s poorest countries - say , Somalia , Yemen , and Uganda - are vastly higher , reaching more than seven births per woman . 
Must countries produce fewer children if they want to accumulate more wealth ? 
All available historical and contemporary evidence suggests that they must . 
Rich countries &apos; transition from subsistence economies to sustained growth and prosperity was conditioned on a profound demographic shift - occurring in the 19 th century in Western Europe and throughout the 20 th century in East Asia - in which fertility rates fell dramatically . 
The last two decades have witnessed similarly sharp fertility declines in poor countries that are now showing solid signs of economic progress . 
In Egypt , for example , fertility rates declined from 4.8 to 2.9 children per woman in the last 15 years . 
During the last decade , Egypt &apos;s average annual per capita income grew by 2.6 % . 
During the same period , Tunisia &apos;s rate of population growth fell by more than 50 % , to a European level of slightly more than two children per woman , while per capita income grew at an impressive annual rate of 3 % . 
Botswana &apos;s incredible annual per capita income growth of approximately 13 % in the last decade was accompanied by a decrease from nearly six children per woman to less than four . 
Why is rapid population growth bad for a country &apos;s standard of living ? 
The math is simple : more people means that ( on average ) everyone gets less . 
A growing population dilutes not only the accumulation of physical capital , but also human capital . 
The quality of children in poor households goes down as their quantity goes up , because poor families with many children are unable to invest enough in the education of each child to ensure that future adults benefit from a key determinant of economic success . 
One reason that the poor have high fertility rates and invest little in education is because raising children in poor countries is cheap . 
Children go to work at relatively young ages , and the prevalence of low wages - particularly for women - means that the cost of parental time is negligible relative to other opportunities . 
Most important , the cost of educating a child relative to the cost of having additional low-educated children is very high in poor countries . 
In other words , families in rich countries , who are relatively well educated , have a comparative advantage in &quot; child quality , &quot; whereas parents in poor countries have a comparative advantage in &quot; child quantity . &quot; 
For example , while the ability of a mother to feed her child is not highly related to her level of human capital , her effectiveness in helping her children with their school homework increases with her own level of education . 
As a result , poverty in poor countries persists over long periods of time . 
Poor people with little education choose high fertility rates and thus low quality children . 
These children grow up to be poor adults , and the cycle goes on , viciously . 
In addition , the negative impact of low child quality on economic performance is amplified by the diluting effect of population growth on the accumulation of physical capital . 
What can be done to break this pattern ? 
Policies such as tax benefits for large families , child allowances , and subsidized day care and meals - all of which reduce the cost of raising children - may be attractive in the short term . 
But they have a negative impact on income in the long run because they encourage households to increase fertility rates . 
What is needed is precisely the opposite : an increase in the cost of child quantity . 
Increasing the cost of raising a child creates a powerful incentive for households to reallocate resources towards improving child quality through higher investment in education . 
This change in relative costs can release a country from the trap of poverty , setting the stage for a demographic transition and economic advancement . 
A revealing example of the effect of policy on fertility patterns comes from the poorest groups in Israel . 
Fertility rates among Israel &apos;s ultra-Orthodox Jews are exceptionally high , averaging six births per woman . 
But in the 1950s and 1960s , before the introduction of generous child allowances to large families , fertility rates among the same group were significantly lower - just three children per woman . 
Moreover , as a result of the benefits , fertility rates among Israeli Bedouins have remained probably the highest in the world , at nearly eight children per woman . 
The implications of this may at first glance seem inhumane , but they are straightforward and unavoidable . 
Canceling , or even reversing , policies that reduce the cost of bearing a high quantity of children would contribute to higher living standards over the long run . 
Public schooling , too , can release people from the poverty trap , because highly educated people have a comparative advantage in raising quality children . 
Policies that encourage economic growth therefore include reallocating government resources or foreign aid from programs that reduce the cost of raising children to financing for public education . 
All it takes is one generation to break the cycle of choosing quantity over quality . 
Even temporary improvement in educational opportunities could permanently affect the level and distribution of skills in the economy .
