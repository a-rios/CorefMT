Jailing the Messengers 
WASHINGTON , DC - As China &apos;s clout in global affairs grows , the world is watching more closely than ever to see what kind of great power it will become . 
Next month , when jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo receives the Nobel Peace Prize , attention will be drawn away from the more encouraging aspects of what China &apos;s leaders like to call their country &apos;s &quot; rise , &quot; and toward their persistent mistreatment of its most outspoken citizens . 
Already , Chinese officials &quot; ham-handed response to the award has undercut their cherished - and lavishly financed - mission to project China &apos;s &quot; soft power &quot; around the globe . 
Liu won the prize because his lifelong commitment to political activism makes him exceptional . 
A Beijing court recently convicted Zhao Lianhai , a 38-year-old former advertising salesman , of &quot; using a popular social issue to incite a mob ... to seriously disrupt social order , &quot; and sentenced him to two and a half years in prison . 
Unlike Liu , Zhao had not called for change in China &apos;s political system . 
Zhao did not set out to become an activist . 
His three-year-old son was lucky to recover quickly after he and 300,000 other children fell ill after drinking the adulterated milk in 2008 . 
Zhao , who once worked for the government &apos;s own product-safety watchdog and lived in the capital , saw an opportunity to help less well-positioned families . 
He set up Web sites to help them exchange medical information , attract media attention , and file lawsuits demanding compensation . 
Initially , the campaign seemed to succeed . 
A massive recall of Chinese milk ensued , and the Sanlu Dairy Group collapsed . 
Two of Sanlu &apos;s suppliers were executed , and its chairwoman was sentenced to life in prison . 
China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress enacted a new food-safety law . 
But , after Zhao and other parents protested that the government &apos;s compensation plan was inadequate to cover the cost of their children &apos;s ongoing medical care , they began to receive threats from local police . 
Zhao &apos;s Web sites were repeatedly shut down , and the group &apos;s lawyers received phone calls from authorities urging them to drop the case . 
In late 2009 , Zhao was officially arrested ; he has been in police custody ever since . 
Zhao &apos;s campaign had been based on the widespread belief in China that while local officials or individual businesspeople may engage in venal or criminal activities , the central government , once informed of the truth , will see to it that justice is done . 
After all , the same Chinese leaders who reject Liu &apos;s calls for political reform argue that what Chinese citizens really want are not &quot; Western-style &quot; rights , but basic necessities - clean water , economic opportunities , safe food - that allow their families to prosper , and which China &apos;s own homegrown political system can adequately protect . 
But Zhao &apos;s conviction , like the mistreatment of other Chinese whistleblowers , sends the message that when faced with a perceived threat to social stability , China &apos;s legal institutions are not up to the task of providing basic protections to its citizens . 
A discussion thread on the case on Tianya , a popular Chinese Internet portal , was soon flooded with comments expressing bafflement and outrage at the verdict . 
&quot; I don &apos;t have children of my own , &quot; wrote one , &quot; but reading this makes my heart hurt . &quot; 
Another wrote : &quot; If things go on this way , our country doesn &apos;t have a future . &quot; 
In Hong Kong , Zhao &apos;s sentence has sparked popular protests outside of government offices and formal objections from local officials . 
Reactions like these ought to be far more worrying to China &apos;s leaders than any rebuke from a group of Norwegians . 
Zhao &apos;s allies are not out to &quot; humiliate China . &quot; 
So do China &apos;s neighbors and global partners - and for reasons that have as much to do with self-interest as political values . 
If China is to honor its commitments on a wide range of international issues - trade , product safety , and environmental protection , to name just a few - and command genuine trust and respect at home and abroad , it will need to embrace people like Zhao , not silence them .
