Ireland &apos;s Moment of Fiscal Decision 
DUBLIN - &quot; The construction of Europe is an art , &quot; former French President Jacques Chirac once said . 
&quot; It is the art of the possible . &quot; 
If so , then Europe &apos;s deconstruction - or , worse , its collapse - would be a shockingly fearful and painful business . 
That was the situation faced by European leaders last autumn . 
The euro was in serious trouble , buffeted by rumors of imminent banking collapses . 
Bond yields in southern Europe were rising , and a pervasive sense of apprehension and fear cloaked governments in European capitals . 
But political leadership was sorely lacking . 
Finally , in December , decisive action was taken . 
There would be a &quot; fiscal treaty , &quot; which would reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact and , importantly , entail automatic sanctions to ensure that eurozone members stick to those rules . 
At the same time , the European Central Bank unleashed its € 1 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) long-term refinancing operation , which pulled the European banking system back from the brink . 
These two measures were both timely and vital , creating a much-needed period of calm . 
In March , having agreed on the fiscal treaty , the European Council turned its attention to reviving economic growth , which will be the key to long-term fiscal sustainability . 
In Ireland , our attorney-general advised on the need to hold a referendum on the fiscal treaty , and we are now in the midst of the campaign . 
The government parties , Fine Gael and Labour , as well as the largest opposition party , Fianna Fáil , are campaigning tirelessly for a yes vote . 
The reasons we are backing the fiscal treaty are simple . 
The treaty would promote stability in the Irish economy and contribute to stabilizing the euro , our currency . 
It would increase confidence in Ireland and allow us to increase the existing flow of inward foreign direct investment . 
Ratification would also give us guaranteed access to funding from the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , should we ever need it . 
The ESM is Ireland &apos;s insurance policy as we work our way out of the bailout program with the &quot; troika &quot; ( the European Commission , the ECB , and the International Monetary Fund ) and return to the markets . 
Most importantly , the fiscal treaty promises to ensure responsible budgeting throughout the eurozone . 
For us , that means that the economic mismanagement that caused the Irish economy &apos;s collapse would never recur . 
It would also mean stable European economies to which we can export . 
For Ireland to continue on the path of economic recovery , it needs to be seen as part of the solution , not part of the problem . 
We are making progress , and we need to continue doing so . 
Ireland &apos;s government has exceeded its targets under the troika program , and the economy returned to growth last year . 
International investors are increasingly looking at Ireland as a smart place to do business . 
They recognize the dynamic , transparent , and competitive fundamentals of the Irish economy . 
We are highly regarded around the world as an excellent export base . 
Global companies recognize that , as the only English-speaking member of the eurozone , Ireland is ideally placed as a gateway to Europe . 
Indeed , Ireland is ranked as the best place in Europe to do business , the easiest in Europe for paying taxes , and number one in Europe for completion of tertiary education . 
We are an open , transparent economy with a highly skilled workforce and a market of 500 million people on our doorstep . 
Crucially , we are also a member of the second-largest currency area in the world . 
Foreign direct investment accounts by more than 1,000 overseas companies translates into 145,000 jobs in Ireland , 70 % of total exports , and € 2.8 billion in corporate-tax receipts . 
These companies spend € 16 billion per year on goods , services , and wages in Ireland . 
The latest figures show that 2011 was a very strong year for attracting investment into the Irish economy , with a record 148 new projects - a 30 % increase in companies investing in Ireland for the first time - implying an additional 13,000 jobs . 
Investors come here because they link Ireland &apos;s eurozone membership to our long-term economic stability and access to outside support if necessary . 
By voting for the fiscal treaty , we can guarantee that stability and support - and thus guarantee continued confidence and investment in the Irish economy . 
The new treaty reflects clear recognition that the euro &apos;s initial design was flawed . 
We spoke about European Monetary Union , but we didn &apos;t have it . 
The Stability and Growth Pact , contained in the Maastricht Treaty , laid down strict rules of budgetary discipline , which were immediately violated - and not by small countries , but by both France and Germany . 
Irish recovery cannot occur without European recovery . 
We must stand together or fall together , because our economies are so interconnected . 
This involves putting our public finances in order , which the fiscal treaty allows . 
We have begun that process ; the next stage will be an unwavering focus on growth and economic renewal throughout the European Union .
