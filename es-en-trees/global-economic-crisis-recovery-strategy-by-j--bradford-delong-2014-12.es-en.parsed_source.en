Try Everything 
BERKELEY - When it became clear in late 2008 that the global economy was headed toward a crash at least as dangerous as the one that had initiated the Great Depression , I was alarmed , but also hopeful . 
We had , after all , seen this before . 
For three and a half years following the start of the Great Depression , US President Herbert Hoover &apos;s top priority was to balance the budget , trying - but ultimately failing - to restore business confidence . 
In 1933 , newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt changed course , adopting a simple yet radical strategy : try everything that might boost demand , increase production , or reduce unemployment - and then keep doing the things that work . 
Roosevelt abandoned attempts to balance the budget , increased the money supply , and initiated deficit spending . 
He took the United States off the gold standard , had the government hire workers directly , and offered loan guarantees to those in danger of losing their homes . 
He cartelized the oil industry and instituted aggressive antitrust policies to break up monopolies . 
To be sure , Roosevelt &apos;s New Deal policies sometimes conflicted with one another , and quite a few of them were counterproductive . 
And so , in late 2008 , the way forward seemed obvious : recapitalize the banks , guarantee loans , use the government-backed housing lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to resolve underwater mortgages , drop short-term interest rates to zero and use quantitative easing to prevent deflation or dangerously low inflation , and embrace deficit spending . 
Then , as events evolved , we would reinforce those policies that seemed to be working and gradually drop those that seemed to be ineffective or counterproductive . 
But that was not what we did . 
Some worried that recapitalizing the banks would reward the very institutions that had caused the problem . 
Others fretted that resolving underwater mortgages would reward feckless borrowers . 
Still others raised concerns about expansionary fiscal and monetary policy . 
Six years on , the economy has yet to fully recover and the problem persists . 
In an article published on Christmas Day in the Wall Street Journal , the usually wise economist Martin Feldstein makes the case for a set of policies designed to stimulate demand , including increasing investment tax credits and shifting the corporate-tax burden to firms that do not spend very much . 
Feldstein &apos;s ideas are promising ; and , in line with the lessons of the Great Depression , they are definitely worth trying . 
The trouble is the rhetoric surrounding his proposals . 
The article &apos;s headline , &quot; The Fed &apos;s Needless Flirtation With Danger , &quot; is followed by warnings that quantitative easing could &quot; increase the risk of financial instability . &quot; 
Instead of simply promoting his policies , Feldstein presents them as a &quot; safe and effective alternative &quot; to other approaches . 
His proposals , he argues , are not an additional arrow in the quiver , but replacements for &quot; traditional Keynesian policies &amp; hellip ; &#91; that &#93; increase budget deficits and national debt . &quot; 
The result is that Feldstein &apos;s contribution to solving our economic difficulties is , at best , unproductive . 
Though he presumably hopes that his commentary will increase the likelihood that his preferred policies are adopted , the more likely real-world effect will be to diminish support for existing policies without marshaling support for a coalition that can implement effective replacements . 
I would be remiss if I did not note that I have sometimes been part of the problem . 
When I look back at everything I have written since 2008 , I find that I , too , have sometimes been too ready to push my favorite recipes at the expense of others . 
As policymakers continue to seek a path out of the ongoing malaise , it would be wise to remember Roosevelt &apos;s words before he led the US out of a very similar crisis . 
&quot; The country needs and &amp; hellip ; demands bold , persistent experimentation , &quot; he said in 1932 . 
&quot; Take a method and try it . 
If it fails , admit it frankly , and try another .
