The Non-Smoking Gun 
MEXICO CITY - Everyone these days , it seems , has their own favorite American diplomatic cable - or will soon - given that the 250,000 documents obtained by WikiLeaks include references to almost every country in the world . 
For Latin America , Wikileaks has so far provided enticing tidbits of both gossip and substance about Brazil and Argentina ; interesting , first-rate analysis regarding Honduras , Bolivia , and Mexico ; and a few intriguing notes about regional politics and international relations . 
Nothing extraordinary has been revealed , but the cables now available allow readers and analysts to draw some preliminary conclusions about the Obama administration &apos;s views of the region ; about Latin American leaders &quot; attitudes toward the United States ; and about the quality of US diplomatic and intelligence-gathering activities in the hemisphere . 
There have been some notable documents , though not many . 
One is clearly the note written by Hugo Llorens , US Ambassador to Honduras , on July 24 , 2009 , immediately after the coup d &quot; état that exiled President Manuel Zelaya . 
The American envoy got right what happened , its implications , and how to enable Barack Obama &apos;s incoming administration to deal intelligently - and differently from the past - with one of its first crises in Latin America . 
A coup was a coup , could not be accepted , and , however provocative Zelaya had been , the only possible US position was his unconditional return to power . 
Another impressive cable was sent on November 17 , 2009 , by Charles H. Rivkin , US Ambassador to France , regarding the competition between French companies and Boeing for a contract worth tens of billions of dollars to provide advanced fighter planes to Brazil . 
The authors got it right : French President Nicolas Sarkozy was pulling out all the stops to close the deal , including support for Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on issues of interest to him , and acceptance of technological , legal , and military conditions imposed by Brazil on French firms , mainly the armaments manufacturer Dassault . 
Perhaps the reports were somewhat naïve in omitting any reference to the many rumors in Brazil regarding widespread corruption in relation to the contract ( of course , US diplomats may have mentioned these issues elsewhere ) . 
Nevertheless , it seems safe to say that Dassault and France will probably win the contract , and that this will be seen as a milestone on the road to US irrelevance in South America . 
Another good example of interesting and competent reporting lies in the cable sent from La Paz , Bolivia on March 30 , 2006 , by Ambassador David Greenlee , highlighting the tensions between the Cuban and Venezuelan advisers and security personnel surrounding President Evo Morales , as well as the circles of elites around him . 
While not terribly new , Greenlee put his finger on one of the ongoing challenges facing Morales - ensuring the loyalty of the Bolivian Armed Forces to his &quot; revolution &quot; - and his main tool for addressing it : Cuban and Venezuelan security backing to deter a military coup . 
Then there are cases of stridency or severe irritation . 
Cables from Managua between 2006 and 2009 rehash old stories about Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega &apos;s ties to drug traffickers like Colombian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar , including mention of a video purportedly showing Sandinistas off-loading cocaine from planes in 1984 , and dwell on Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez &apos;s off-the-books financial backing for Ortega . 
There is also a quaint anecdote regarding Nicaraguan prizefighter Ricardo Mayorga , who was caught by Sandinista security while raping or harassing a young woman in his hotel ; according to the cables , Ortega blackmailed Mayorga into sharing his boxing proceeds with him and supporting him in the elections that year . 
None of this is especially earth-shattering or original , except insofar as it seems to suggest the persistence of a Cold War mentality in US foreign-policy thinking about Latin America . 
Similarly , a cable concerning a Mexican-sponsored attempt earlier this year to create something like the Organization of American States , but without the US and Canada , is chockfull of largely accurate but excessive rhetoric blasting Mexican diplomacy . 
Backing the creation of a &quot; Community of Latin American and Caribbean States , &quot; according to the cable , is logical for a would-be regional hegemon like Brazil , but somewhat absurd for Mexico , which does 90 % of everything ( trade , investment , tourism , immigration ) with the US and Canada , and depends on US support in fighting the country &apos;s drug cartels . 
Obama plunged into Mexico &apos;s drug war at the outset of his administration , and now faces perils that are barely touched upon in Washington , except in cables originating in Mexico . 
Regarding the execution of Arturo Beltran Leyva , a leading drug kingpin , late last year , US Ambassador Carlos Pascual wrote that the &quot; refusal &quot; by SEDENA ( the national defense secretariat ) &quot; to move quickly reflected a risk-aversion that cost the institution a major counter-narcotics victory . &quot; 
He then describes the utter lack of cooperation between intelligence agencies and the military , because many US and Mexican officials fear that whatever information they share with the army will be handed over to the cartels . 
The logical conclusion of all this is evident : since Mexican President Felipe Calderón himself cannot be both president and drug czar , and is rightly unwilling and logically unable to carry out the necessary day-to-day interagency coordination in Mexico , the void will be filled by someone else . 
Increasingly , it is being filled by the US Embassy in Mexico City , staffed by first-rate diplomats who may be biting off more than they can chew . 
There is no smoking gun in WikiLeaks &quot; releases about US policy toward Latin America ( not yet , at least ) .
