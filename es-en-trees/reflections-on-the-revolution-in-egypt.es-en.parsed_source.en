Reflections on the Revolution in Egypt 
NEW YORK - Revolutions happen for a reason . 
In the case of Egypt , there are several reasons : more than 30 years of one-man rule ; 
The net result was that many Egyptians felt not just alienated , but also humiliated . 
Humiliation is a powerful motivator . 
Egypt was ripe for revolution ; dramatic change would have come at some point in the next few years , even absent the spark of Tunisia or the existence of social media . 
Indeed , social media are a significant factor , but their role has been exaggerated . 
It is hardly the first disruptive technology to come along : the printing press , telegraph , telephone , radio , television , and cassettes all posed challenges to the existing order of their day . 
And like these earlier technologies , social media are not decisive : they can be repressed by governments as well as employed by governments to motivate their supporters . 
Timing counts for a lot in politics . 
Mubarak &apos;s announcement that he would not seek re-election would likely have averted a crisis had he issued it in December . 
But , by the time he did say it , the mood of the street had evolved to the point that he could no longer placate it . 
The initial success of revolutions is determined less by the strength of the protesters than by the will and cohesion of the regime . 
Tunisia &apos;s collapse came quickly , because its president lost his nerve and the army was weak and unwilling to stand by him . 
Egypt &apos;s establishment and its military are demonstrating far greater resolve . 
Mubarak &apos;s departure is a significant but not decisive development . 
To be sure , it closes a prolonged era of Egyptian politics . 
It also marks the end of the first phase of Egypt &apos;s revolution . 
But it is only the end of the beginning . 
What begins now is the struggle for Egypt &apos;s future . 
Egyptians need time to build a civil society and open a political spectrum that has been mostly closed for decades . 
A hybrid , caretaker government , including military and civilian elements , may be the best way forward . To slow the clock is not to stop it , however . 
A genuine political transition needs to move ahead , albeit at a measured pace . 
Early elections should be avoided , lest those ( such as the Muslim Brotherhood ) who have been able to organize over the years enjoy an unfair advantage . 
The Muslim Brotherhood should be allowed to participate in the political process so long as it accepts the legitimacy of that process , the rule of law , and the constitution . 
The history and political culture of Egypt suggest a natural limit to the Brotherhood &apos;s appeal if Egyptians can bridge their most important differences , maintain order , and restore economic growth . 
Constitutional reform is critical . 
Egypt needs a constitution that enjoys broad support - and that includes checks and balances that make it difficult for minorities ( even those who command the support of a plurality of voters ) to rule majorities . 
Revolutionary movements invariably split into factions . 
Their sole common objective is the ouster of the existing regime . 
As soon as this goal comes close to being achieved , elements of the opposition begin to position themselves for the second phase of the struggle and the coming competition for power . 
We are already beginning to see signs of this in Egypt and will see more in the days and weeks to come . 
Some in Egypt will be satisfied only with full democracy ; others ( probably a majority ) will care most about public order , greater official accountability , a degree of political participation , and economic improvement . 
It is never possible to satisfy the demands of all protesters , and regimes should not try . 
Egypt will face enormous economic difficulties , exacerbated by recent events , which have frightened off tourists , deterred investment , and kept many from working . 
The challenges of a fast-growing population , inadequate education , insufficient jobs , corruption , bureaucracy , and rising global competition constitute the greatest threat to the country &apos;s future . 
Outsiders have had and will have only limited influence over the course of events . 
Over the past 30 years , intermittent calls by the United States for limited political reform were largely rebuffed . 
Once the crisis began , the people in the streets , Mubarak himself , and above all the army have been the principal protagonists . 
Moving forward , it will again be Egyptians who will largely determine their own path . 
In this vein , outsiders should be careful of intervening too much , especially in public . 
It is up to Egyptians to define for themselves how much and what kind of democracy is established . 
Outsiders can assist - for example , with ideas for constitutional reform or voting procedures - but this should be done privately and as suggestions , not demands . 
Developments in Egypt will have uneven consequences in the region . 
Not every country will be affected equally . 
True monarchies , like Jordan , have a legitimacy and stability that the leaders of faux monarchies ( Syria , Libya , and Yemen ) , as well as the Iranian regime , do not . 
Much will depend on what transpires and how . 
Change in Iraq was imposed from the outside by force , whereas change in Egypt has come from within and has largely been accomplished by consent rather than coercion .
