Are Services the New Manufactures ? 
PRINCETON - The global discussion about growth in the developing world has taken a sharp turn recently . 
The hype and excitement of recent years over the prospect of rapid catch-up with the advanced economies have evaporated . 
Few serious analysts still believe that the spectacular economic convergence experienced by Asian countries , and less spectacularly by most Latin American and African countries , will be sustained in the decades ahead . 
The low interest rates , high commodity prices , rapid globalization , and post-Cold War stability that underpinned this extraordinary period are unlikely to persist . 
A second realization has sunk in : Developing countries need a new growth model . 
The problem is not just that they need to wean themselves from their reliance on fickle capital inflows and commodity booms , which have often left them vulnerable to shocks and prone to crises . 
More important , export-oriented industrialization , history &apos;s most certain path to riches , may have run its course . 
Ever since the Industrial Revolution , manufacturing has been the key to rapid economic growth . 
The countries that caught up with and eventually surpassed Britain , such as Germany , the United States , and Japan , all did so by building up their manufacturing industries . 
Following the Second World War , there were two waves of rapid economic convergence : one in the European periphery during the 1950s and 1960s , and another in East Asia since the 1960s . 
Both were based on industrial manufacturing . 
China , which has emerged as the archetype of this growth strategy since the 1970s , traveled a well-worn path . 
But manufacturing today is not what it used to be . 
It has become much more capital- and skill-intensive , with greatly diminished potential to absorb large amounts of labor from the countryside . 
While global supply chains have facilitated entry into manufacturing , they have also reduced the gains in terms of value added that accrue at home . 
Many traditional industries , such as textiles and steel , are likely to face shrinking global markets and over-capacity , driven by demand shifts and environmental concerns . 
And one downside of China &apos;s success is that many other countries are finding it much harder to establish more than a niche in manufacturing . 
As a consequence , developing countries are starting to de-industrialize and become more dependent on services at much lower levels of income than has been the pattern for developed countries - a phenomenon that I have called premature de-industrialization . 
Can service industries play the role that manufacturing did in the past ? 
Already , services contribute the bulk of GDP in developing countries , even in low-income countries where agriculture has traditionally played a big part . 
Young workers who leave the farm for the cities are increasingly absorbed into urban services jobs instead of manufacturing . 
And international trade in services has tended to expand more rapidly than trade in goods . 
Among the optimists are Ejaz Ghani and Stephen D. O &apos;Connell of the World Bank . 
In a recent paper , they argue that service industries could serve as a growth escalator , the role traditionally assumed by manufacturing . 
In particular , they show that services have exhibited &quot; unconditional convergence &quot; in productivity recently . 
This would be very good news , but there are reasons to be wary . 
The Ghani-O &apos;Connell evidence includes data starting in the early 1990s , during which developing countries were experiencing economy-wide convergence , boosted by capital inflows and commodity windfalls . 
It is unclear whether their conclusions extend to other periods . 
Two things make services different from manufacturing . 
First , while some segments of services are tradable and are becoming more important in global commerce , these typically are highly skill-intensive sectors that employ comparatively few ordinary workers . 
Banking , finance , insurance , and other business services , along with information and communications technology ( ICT ) , are all high-productivity activities that pay high wages . 
They could act as growth escalators in economies where the work force is adequately trained . 
In such economies , tradable services cannot absorb more than a fraction of the labor supply . 
That is why , for all of its success , the ICT sector in India has not been a primary driver of economic growth . 
By contrast , traditional manufacturing could offer a large number of jobs to workers straight off the farm , at productivity levels three to four times that in agriculture . 
In today &apos;s developing countries , the bulk of excess labor is absorbed in non-tradable services operating at very low levels of productivity , in activities such as retail trade and housework . 
In principle , many of these activities could benefit from better technologies , improved organization , and greater formalization . 
Partial productivity gains in non-tradable activities are ultimately self-limiting , because individual service activities cannot expand without turning their terms of trade against themselves - pushing down their own prices ( and profitability ) . 
In manufacturing , small developing countries could thrive on the basis of a few export successes and diversify sequentially through time - t-shirts now , followed by the assembly of televisions and microwave ovens , and on up the chain of skill and value . 
By contrast , in services , where market size is limited by domestic demand , continued success requires complementary and simultaneous gains in productivity in the rest of the economy . 
Focusing on a few sectors yields no quick winning opportunities . 
Growth therefore must rely on the much slower accumulation of economy-wide capabilities in the form of human capital and institutions . 
So I remain skeptical that a services-led model can deliver rapid growth and good jobs in the way that manufacturing once did . 
Even if the technological optimists are right , it is difficult to see how that will enable developing countries to sustain the kind of growth they experienced over the last couple of decades .
