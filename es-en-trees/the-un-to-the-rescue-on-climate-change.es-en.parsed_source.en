The UN to the Rescue on Climate Change 
PARIS - The United Nations &quot; General Assembly is the world &apos;s only body in which all countries vote , with majority rule prevailing . 
There is no unanimity requirement or veto in the General Assembly , which might well be why it has not been called upon in the effort to fight climate change . 
Yet the General Assembly is the only place where obstruction by major countries - for example , by China and the United States at December &apos;s global climate talks in Copenhagen - can be bypassed . 
Of course , the UN has played a leading role on climate change before now . 
A &quot; Conference of Parties &quot; ( COP ) has met almost every year since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro . 
These meetings are often technical and the discussions are usually among ambassadors . 
This was the case in Kyoto in 1997 , and again in Copenhagen at COP15 . 
One might recall that many delegations arrived in Kyoto resignedly willing to accept the idea of a tax on greenhouse-gas emissions , or at least on carbon dioxide , the most commonly encountered greenhouse gas . 
The US delegation , dispatched by a government intent on reducing state intervention in the economy , declared itself vehemently opposed to the idea . 
The US delegation suggested a totally different scheme from the one being discussed . 
In the end , that scheme was chosen in Kyoto with the hope that the US , which had proposed it , would then ratify it . 
China and India were absent at the time , and Russia was hostile to the idea . 
But the US refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol . 
The European Union was the only group of nations that seriously considered implementing it . 
A European quota system , limited to electricity producers and materials manufacturers , the two major sources of emissions , has been in place since 2005 . 
The COP15 conference in Copenhagen was supposed to forge a successor treaty that would take effect when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012 . 
But four days of discussion among world leaders resulted in a fiasco . 
A four-page document was vaguely approved by acclamation but not submitted to a vote . 
Such a failure is extremely harmful . 
With no government commitments , there can be no attempt to limit carbon emissions effectively , which implies that when the world does begin to take action , it will be that much more difficult to slow the pace of climate change and mitigate its effects . 
Moreover , Europe has been left uncertain about its own system of quotas , which has not functioned particularly well in the first place . 
More than half of the 43 members of the Association of Small Island States believe that the decision to do nothing , to let ocean waters rise , can be considered tantamount to approval of murder . 
The smallest among them , Tuvalu , with 11,000 inhabitants , is already searching for a place to evacuate its citizens when their island is submerged . 
More than half of Bangladesh &apos;s territory , home to 100 million inhabitants , is threatened by flooding , as is the Netherlands , with 16 million people , for a quarter of its territory . 
Most of the potential climate refugees will end up in huge zones of increasing dryness - the Middle East , the Mediterranean region , central China , and the US . 
Some predict that this migration will take place as soon as the second half of this century . 
Given the scale of the looming catastrophe , the world cannot afford to leave things as they are . 
Of course , the process has not stopped . 
Conferences on climate change will still be held . 
Indeed , people and governments need to express their anger at the fact that no binding agreement was reached in Copenhagen , despite the willingness of many of those who were present . 
Fortunately , enough was accomplished in Copenhagen to re-boot the process . 
But that re-boot must start now , and the UN , specifically the General Assembly , is the place to begin . 
Many commentators have condemned the UN for the failure in Copenhagen . 
But that is a misreading of what happened . The UN was only the tour operator in Copenhagen . 
It supplied logistics , interpreters , and an address book . 
Its steering bodies did not function , because they were not called upon during the talks . 
It is thus time to make real use of the UN , to call upon the General Assembly to take the lead . 
The UN was not responsible for the failure in Copenhagen , and it should not act as if it was .
