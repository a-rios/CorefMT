America Adrift 
TOKYO - US President Barack Obama &apos;s hesitations , ambivalence , U-turns , and political gamesmanship with the US Congress over punishing Syria for its use of chemical weapons has achieved only two things with certainty : it has raised Russia &apos;s diplomatic profile for the first time in many years , and it has spooked those of America &apos;s allies - from Saudi Arabia and Israel to Japan and South Korea - that rely heavily on US promises . 
To minimize the impact of both consequences , the United States now must enforce with utmost determination its agreement with Russia on eliminating Syria &apos;s chemical weapons . 
US Secretary of State John Kerry &apos;s heat-of-the-moment comment that a military strike on Syria could be avoided if all chemical weapons were turned over was a diplomatic gift to Russia , and it responded with alacrity . 
Putin &apos;s initiative turned out to be a diplomatic lifeline , as Obama &apos;s gambit of seeking Congressional approval for an attack on Syria looked certain to fail , which would have dented his authority as America &apos;s commander-in-chief . 
Although the agreement may yet strip Assad &apos;s regime of some of its most dangerous weapons , the process - if it can be called that - which brought it about has strengthened a global perception that US foreign policy in Obama &apos;s second term is either adrift or drifting into isolationism . 
The US response to the so-called &quot; Arab Spring , &quot; for example , has lacked political conviction , much less strategic direction . 
Egypt &apos;s old-new military rulers , for example , have concluded that American criticism can be ignored , because America cannot cut off its aid to Egypt for geopolitical reasons . 
When I met with Egypt &apos;s foreign minister , Nabil Fahmy , in August , he hinted at the new regime &apos;s dissatisfaction with attempts by the European Union and the US to influence his country &apos;s domestic affairs . 
Egypt , he said , understood the importance of democracy and human rights , but avoiding turmoil must be the government &apos;s highest priority . 
Of course , appeals to &quot; stability &quot; are nothing new from authoritarian governments . 
As Pakistan &apos;s then-president , Pervez Musharraf , dismissively put it when I visited Islamabad as Japan &apos;s defense minister , &quot; Democracy ? 
I know all about that . &quot; 
The US , of course , claims that it , too , knows all about democracy . 
Moreover , the consequences of such foreign-policy waffling extend far beyond the Middle East . 
In November 2009 , when Obama visited Japan for the first time as President , he emphasized that he was from Hawaii and proud to be &quot; Americans &quot; first Pacific president . &quot; 
Two years later , then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton published &quot; America &apos;s Pacific Century , &quot; indicating a shift in America &apos;s global strategy . 
This declaration of a &quot; return to Asia &quot; marked the start of the famous &quot; pivot &quot; to the Pacific in US foreign policy - a shift away from the Middle East that was intended to meet the challenges posed by China &apos;s growing geopolitical ambitions . 
All of Asia &apos;s democracies ( and a few of its autocracies , particularly Vietnam ) welcomed it . 
But , though rhetoric matters in diplomacy , the pivot will be fatally undermined if Asians perceive the same sort of gap between America &apos;s words and its actions that has become apparent in its Middle East policy ( despite Kerry &apos;s determined efforts to revitalize peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority ) . 
In particular , there is a gnawing fear that the US may yet choose the &quot; G-2 &quot; option : a grand bargain with China for the two countries to decide Asia &apos;s fate by themselves and over our heads . 
Given the size and clout of countries like India , Japan , Indonesia , and South Korea , such a condominium is , no doubt , doomed to failure . 
So , as tempting as such a relationship may be , the US ought to resist it . 
Meanwhile , in Japan , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has begun a national discussion concerning how the country can take greater responsibility for its own defense . 
His government continues to place great faith in the Japan-US alliance as the bedrock of Japanese ( and Asian ) security . 
But Abe &apos;s government also recognizes that the world &apos;s geopolitical tectonic plates are shifting , and that many in the US are tempted by the siren song of isolationism . 
So Abe feels obliged to put Japan in a position to be able to help Asia &apos;s democracies manage any crisis that may emerge in the event of a change in America &apos;s regional presence . 
In the coming days , Japan will welcome Caroline Kennedy , the daughter of President John F. Kennedy and the likely new US ambassador . 
May that example , similar to her father &apos;s appeal 53 years ago for the defense of freedom , also call forth the best in the American spirit .
