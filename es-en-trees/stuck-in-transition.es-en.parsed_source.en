Stuck in Transition 
LONDON - The G-8 recently asked the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , which was created to support the post-communist transitions to democracy and market economies in Central and Eastern Europe , to put its experience to use in Egypt . 
An important difference is that , unlike Eastern Europe in 1989 , the countries of the &quot; Arab Spring &quot; do not have centrally planned economies . 
While the state is involved in much economic activity and property rights are frequently contested , private property is nevertheless firmly established . 
Subsidies are common , but prices are not fixed . 
There may be impediments to international trade , but nothing like in Eastern Europe , which largely traded with itself in distorted and artificial ways . 
So it is in the countries of the Eastern Europe of today - and the two decades of reform experiences that have brought them to where they are - that we should seek parallels with North Africa . 
Despite the financial crisis , political and economic progress in Central Europe and the Baltic countries has been remarkable . 
On the other hand , most countries in the former Soviet Union are like much of North Africa and the Middle East - &quot; stuck in transit . &quot; 
Some , like Belarus and Uzbekistan , have not even started reforms in earnest . 
The richness of Eastern European transition experience offers valuable clues about how to break out of being &quot; stuck in transit . &quot; 
The emotional debates over &quot; shock therapy &quot; vs. gradualism have been replaced by a broad consensus that , while we need to exploit windows of political opportunity , not everything can be done at once , and reversal is always a threat . 
Careful sequencing of reforms is critical to ultimate success . 
By starting with more visible and popular reforms in the short term , policymakers can build constituencies for tougher reforms later . 
Key constituencies for political and economic reform in Central and Eastern Europe have been private small and medium-size firms and younger age cohorts . 
Developing private sectors with meaningful jobs is even more important in countries like Egypt , which have much younger and rapidly growing populations . 
The state has an important role to play in this process . 
Early calls in many countries to dismantle the state have given way to more sophisticated assessments . 
A strong state is needed to support nascent markets and enforce laws and regulation , and it must invest in productivity-enhancing education and health care . 
Another lesson is that we should not worry too much about shifting political majorities . 
In fact , the ability of voters to remove incumbent governments has proven to be a strength , not a weakness . 
The Polish government that launched the initial &quot; shock therapy &quot; reforms was replaced by a coalition with a &quot; gradualist &quot; bent and greater concern for distributional outcomes . 
Since then , successive Polish governments of varied orientations have taken turns . 
In the end , the country has built a thriving economy and a well-established democracy capable of dealing with calamities such as the global financial crisis and the tragic death of the country &apos;s president last year . 
Fear of reversals should not be used to bypass parliaments and civil society . 
Important constitutional reforms and normal parliamentary processes were suspended in Russia in the early 1990 &quot; s , owing to fear of a Soviet revival . 
While this prospect seemed real enough at the time , we now know that such an outcome was highly unlikely , given the economic and political bankruptcy of the system . 
Today , poorly thought-out reforms in North Africa and the Middle East are being rushed through under the perceived threat of Islamist extremism . 
But even when such fears are well-founded , reforms should be evaluated on their own merits in broad consultations . 
In Central Europe and the Baltics , the promise of EU accession offered a path through the transition . 
As for most of the countries of the former Soviet Union , which remain stuck in transit , EU membership is not in the cards for North Africa and the Middle East . 
Even so , these countries &quot; geographic proximity to Europe enhances the benefits from trade and financial integration .
