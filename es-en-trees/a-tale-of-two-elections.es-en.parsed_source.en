A Tale of Two Elections 
LONDON - Individual elections do not always enhance democracy - a useful reminder that the ballot box is only one part , albeit a central one , in any free , plural society . 
Of course , there are also magnificent examples of elections that strengthen both the stability and the institutions of a community . 
We have just witnessed an example of the second kind in India , the world &apos;s largest and greatest democracy , where 420 million voters there returned a Congress-led government with a solid majority . 
It was in many respects a personal triumph for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . 
His victory shows that it is possible to succeed in politics through decency , honesty , and high intelligence . 
Sonia Gandhi and her family should also take credit for putting at the forefront of their campaign a vision of an inclusive society , which rejects divisions on the basis of caste , ethnicity , language , and religion . 
The result should help India to continue - not without occasional turbulence - its journey toward becoming a high-growth economy that raises the standard and quality of life for the poor . 
I wish we could look forward in Europe to a similarly healthy democratic experience next month when voters throughout the European Union elect new members of the European Parliament . 
Since 1979 , these MEPs have been elected direct rather than indirectly from national parliaments . 
But turnout for these elections has been falling in several countries . 
There is a danger that the number voting in June will be lower than ever before . 
Moreover , in the current grim economic conditions across Europe , voters who do turn out are all too likely to take the opportunity to punish the major parties and vote for fringe and even extremist politicians . 
There are particular circumstances that may encourage this electoral response . 
First , everywhere there is a sense of disgust at the way the recent boom seemed to privatize gains while the subsequent bust socialized losses . 
A few rich individuals appeared to gain and all taxpayers to lose . 
This has spread a sense of unfairness . 
Second , globalization has been the target for populist criticism . 
It is usually defined to mean everything we dislike - from changes to our traditional way of life to loss of jobs . 
It is a brave politician who points out how much liberalizing trade and opening up markets have increased our overall prosperity . 
Third , in Britain at least , the entire political class has been discredited by a sleazy scandal about the expenses that many parliamentarians have paid themselves . 
Analogies with pigs , snouts , and troughs fill the pages of British newspapers . 
But there is another reason for the lack of interest in the EU elections . 
The European Parliament has power , but it deals with issues that , while important to voters , do not top their list of concerns . 
The EU &apos;s member states retain power over the most sensitive political issues , including taxes , health , education , pensions , the labor market , and foreign policy . 
So the questions that dominate national campaigns have little impact on European elections . 
The European Parliament deals with the important areas where individual countries have pooled their sovereignty , like trade , the creation of a pan-European market , and the biggest environmental issues . 
But these are not often the questions that trigger the most passionate interest . 
In addition , the European Parliament &apos;s detachment from national political debates means that it has less political legitimacy than is desirable . 
Indeed , those who worry about the creation of a European superstate can rest easy . 
There will be no such entity , because there is no European electorate ; the electorate remains French , Belgian , Latvian , Greek , and so on . 
They all vote at the same time , for the same institution . 
But what does an Italian know - or care , for that matter - about British politics ? 
Look at our television programs . 
We know far more about Europe &apos;s football than we do about Europe &apos;s politics . 
That is no criticism of those who work - often very hard - in the European Parliament . 
We have created a political body that has power to hold European institutions to account but has no obvious European electorate to which it can itself be held accountable . 
A parliament without a people inevitably increases the sense of frustration that many European voters feel about the process of making Europe-wide policy choices in their name . 
If the Lisbon Treaty is ratified later this year , one of the changes should result in national parliaments becoming more involved in European decision-making . 
But we need to look country-by-country at what else we can do to tie Europe &apos;s own parliament into national politics . 
Unless we do that better , fewer people will vote for MEPs , more of them will be elected simply on a protest vote and represent Europe &apos;s murky extremes , and the whole practice and principle of European democracy will be discredited .
