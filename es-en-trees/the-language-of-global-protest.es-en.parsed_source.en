The Language of Global Protest 
PRINCETON - The protest movements that have flared up across the West , from Chile to Germany , have remained curiously undefined and under-analyzed . 
Some speak of them as the greatest global mobilization since 1968 - when enragés in very different countries coalesced around similar concerns . 
The Bulgarian political scientist Ivan Krastev , for example , has claimed that what we are actually experiencing is 1968 &quot; in reverse . &quot; 
&quot; Then students on the streets of Europe , &quot; he says , &quot; declared their desire to live in a world different from the world of their parents . 
Now students are on the streets to declare their desire to live in the world of their parents . &quot; 
No name and no clear interpretation have yet attached itself to the movements . 
Such self-understandings should also influence how citizens generally should respond to these movements . 
Nineteen sixty-eight was famously over-theorized . 
Student leaders , or so most people remember , were constantly producing convoluted manifestos that combined Marxism , psychoanalysis , and theories about Third World liberation struggles . 
What is easily forgotten is that even the most theory-eager leaders of the time understood that ultimately , the protest movements that helped to define 1968 didn &apos;t come out of seminar-room discussions . 
The German leader Rudi Dutschke , for example , insisted that the movement was driven by &quot; existential disgust &quot; - and anger , provoked by the Vietnam War in particular . 
Many putative &quot; theorists &quot; themselves declared that the enragés should let go of revolutionary textbooks and , instead , &quot; practically problematize &quot; inherited radical strategies . 
Put more simply : they were supposed to make it up as they went along . 
In that sense , 1968 and today &apos;s protests are not as different as some observers claim . 
There is no political playbook , but there are events and also books that inspired outrage : Frantz Fanon &apos;s Wretched of the Earth in the 1960 &quot; s and , nowadays , the unlikely bestseller Indignez-Vous ! , by the 93-year old former French Resistance fighter Stéphane Hessel . 
As critics have mockingly pointed out , Hessel &apos;s booklet at times reads more like a call for a free-floating , almost arbitrary desire to be agitated by something - almost anything , really , as long as it can somehow be justified by one &apos;s own subjective sense of justice . 
It did not help that Hessel nostalgically invoked Jean-Paul Sartre and existentialism , and the &quot; great stream of history &quot; - longings reflected on a hand-painted sign at Occupy Wall Street : &quot; Get excited and do something . &quot; 
Tellingly , that sign was flanked by posters for the left-wing anarchist philosopher Noam Chomsky and the right-wing libertarian politician Ron Paul . 
Still , for all the theoretical weaknesses of Hessel &apos;s treatise , &quot; indignation &quot; has become a watchword for movements in France , Spain , and elsewhere . 
And language matters here : indignation suggests that some social actors - a government or elites in general - have violated shared norms or moral understandings . 
This is the literally &quot; reactionary &quot; interpretation of these movements : they are animated by a sense that the social contract has been broken , and that elites ought to return to the status quo that preceded the policies which ultimately led to the financial crisis . 
If so , the people on the squares of Madrid , Athens , and New York are not so much demonstrating against those in power - give or take a few anarchists - as demonstrating to those in power that they should feel ashamed for having reneged on supposedly shared commitments . 
Indignation is different from outrage - a sentiment that is ultimately blind and not necessarily connected to any presumption that one shares commitments with the people against whom it is directed . 
This is to some degree also the story of 1968 : righteous disgust led to outrage , but , when channeled through completely unrealistic revolutionary theorizing , also to self-righteousness and , ultimately , to elaborate justifications for physical violence on the part of radical factions . 
In such a scenario , self-empowered minorities come to speak in the name of imaginary majorities - a populism of sorts , and , like all populism , driven by emotions more than by norms , let alone reasons . 
The distinction between indignation and outrage might seem like nitpicking . 
On that point , the demonstrators have so far remained curiously mute : they have yet to articulate any wider demands or a sense of what a different society , or &quot; real democracy &quot; - a stock phrase of the Spanish movement - should be all about . 
If today &apos;s protest movements are based on righteous indignation , the lack of concrete demands should not be a problem : shared norms ( and the policies that would follow from them ) can still broadly be assumed . 
But if they are being driven by rage , then a lack of clear goals might merely produce more anger and frustration , which in turn could eventually lead to physical violence and some kind of political nihilism . 
This also means that political elites should try to understand and work with the message of indignation - and not cynically play up anger for electoral advantage . It is not just ridiculous , but downright irresponsible , for example , that the British Labour Party intellectual Maurice Glasman now feels compelled to reveal the so-far hidden &quot; angry insurgent side &quot; of party leader Ed Miliband . 
Elites - and protesters &quot; fellow citizens - should respond conscientiously and creatively to moral indignation , comprehending that it is ultimately about an affirmation of liberal democracy , and not about all-out revolution , let alone nihilism .
