A Chinese Monroe Doctrine ? 
NEW DELHI - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi &apos;s upcoming visit to India will include his first meetings with India &apos;s new government , including Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and , more important , Prime Minister Narendra Modi . 
But the trip is about more than getting acquainted . 
The leaders of both countries will be taking one another &apos;s measure , and their conclusions will determine how the relationship between the world &apos;s two most populous countries evolves . 
In some ways , the bilateral relationship is already moving in a positive direction , especially on the economic front . 
But , as trade imbalances favoring China become apparent , India is growing increasingly frustrated . 
Wang , an establishment figure well versed in Indian affairs , will make every effort to downplay these imbalances and promote deeper ties . 
A far more formidable challenge will be resolving the dispute over the countries &quot; Himalayan frontier - the world &apos;s longest unsettled land border . 
Indeed , &quot; special representatives &quot; from the two countries have already met 17 times to settle the issue , but have made precious little progress , not least because of Chinese concerns about the restive border provinces of Tibet and Xinjiang . 
As if the conflict were not already complicated enough , China has adopted an increasingly assertive stance in the area , including several incursions into disputed territory . 
For example , last year , Chinese troops established a temporary camp in Ladakh &apos;s Depsang valley , leading to a high-stakes standoff with India . 
As long as the &quot; line of actual control &quot; remains undefined , tensions will continue to escalate - raising serious risks for both countries . 
Another major point of contention is China &apos;s reflexive support for Pakistan &apos;s efforts to destabilize Ladakh and Kashmir , buttressed by deepening military cooperation . 
This aspect of China &apos;s foreign policy is puzzling , not only because it undermines relations with India , but also in view of Chinese fears of Islamist radicalism among the Xinjiang &apos;s Uighurs . 
All of this highlights a fundamental flaw in China &apos;s external strategy : its efforts to use its increasingly powerful military to intimidate its neighbors come at the expense of its own long-term security . 
Indeed , instead of trying to build a mutually beneficial relationship with its largest neighbor , China has sought to encircle India by asserting military control of surrounding territories . 
This so-called &quot; string of pearls &quot; strategy directly threatens India &apos;s national-security interests , rendering the type of robust bilateral relationship that would benefit both countries next to impossible . 
Of course , China claims that its intentions toward India are peaceful . 
For example , it contends that its efforts to establish bases in the Indian Ocean and bolster its blue-water navy are aimed at safeguarding the Malacca Straits , a maritime trade route that is perceived as a choke point for the Chinese economy . 
But actions speak louder than words - and the message that China &apos;s behavior is sending is far from peaceful . 
Indeed , Chinese leaders seem to be taking advantage of the opening provided by an overstretched United States to assert control over a broad expanse of Asia &apos;s oceans . 
To this end , China has created a vast Air Defense Identification Zone covering most of the East China Sea - including territories claimed and controlled by Japan and South Korea - where it has also declared disputed territories to be part of its own exclusive economic zone . 
These unilateral moves resemble the announcement by the United States in 1823 of what became known as the Monroe Doctrine , which , among other things , placed Latin America within a strictly US sphere of influence . 
At the just-concluded Shangri-La Security Dialogue in Singapore , US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel called China &apos;s actions &quot; destabilizing . &quot; 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe echoed this sentiment , declaring that Japan will play a larger role in safeguarding regional security , including by providing patrol ships , training , and military surveillance equipment to countries engaged in territorial disputes with China . 
The response from China was immediate and unambiguous . 
Wang Guanzhong , Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People &apos;s Liberation Army , blasted Hagel and Abe for &quot; corroborating and colluding ... to provoke and challenge China . &quot; 
While Modi has not yet commented on the security challenge that China &apos;s actions are creating , he will have to do so soon . 
In fact , Chinese President Xi Jinping practically insisted that India join the discussion when , in a speech in Shanghai last month , he said that &quot; India , the world &apos;s largest weapons-systems importer , must take very serious note &quot; of mounting regional tensions . 
But Modi will need to offer more than words to meet India &apos;s national security interests . 
Because India has just endured a decade of neglect by the previous Congress government , the new administration will have to act quickly and decisively to safeguard the country &apos;s national-security . 
This imperative is made all the more urgent by China &apos;s decision to expand its defense budget by more than 12 % , to $ 132 billion , in the next fiscal year , as well as its recently concluded 30-year energy deal with Russia , which has strategic implications for India . 
Wang &apos;s visit thus is coming at a time of fundamental redefinition of Sino-Indian relations . 
Given that continued friction is inevitable , even if no conflict occurs , the challenge is to find a way to engage in creative and competitive cooperation that bolsters both countries &quot; efforts to eradicate poverty and promote economic development . 
Xi has said that , &quot; We need to innovate in our security concepts , establish a new regional security-cooperation architecture , and jointly build a shared , win-win road for Asian security . &quot; 
But China &apos;s actions suggest that its leaders view Chinese hegemony as the only viable security structure for the region . 
Subordination to China is certainly not Modi &apos;s goal . 
The question is whether he can work with China and other Asian actors to design an alternative framework for regional peace .
