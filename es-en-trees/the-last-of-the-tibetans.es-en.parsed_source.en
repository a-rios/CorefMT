The Last of the Tibetans 
NEW YORK  -  
Are the Tibetans doomed to go the way of the American Indians ? 
Will they be reduced to nothing more than a tourist attraction , peddling cheap mementos of what a once-great culture ? 
That sad fate is looking more and more likely , and the Olympic year already has been soured by the Chinese government &apos;s efforts to suppress resistance to it . 
The Chinese have much to answer for , but the fate of Tibet is not just a matter of semi-colonial oppression . 
It is often forgotten that many Tibetans , especially educated people in the larger towns , were so keen to modernize their society in the mid-twentieth century that they saw the Chinese Communists as allies against rule by holy monks and serf-owning landlords . 
In the early 1950 &quot; s , the young Dalai Lama himself was impressed by Chinese reforms and wrote poems praising Chairman Mao . 
Alas , instead of reforming Tibetan society and culture , the Chinese Communists ended up wrecking it . 
Religion was crushed in the name of official Marxist atheism . 
Monasteries and temples were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution ( often with the help of Tibetan Red Guards ) . 
Nomads were forced to live in ugly concrete settlements . 
Tibetan arts were frozen into folkloric emblems of an officially promoted &quot; minority culture . &quot; 
And the Dalai Lama and his entourage were forced to flee to India . 
None of this was peculiar to Tibet . 
The wrecking of tradition and forced cultural regimentation took place everywhere in China . 
In some respects , the Tibetans were treated less ruthlessly than the majority of Chinese . 
Nor was the challenge to Tibetan uniqueness typical of the Communists . 
General Chiang Kai-shek declared in 1946 that the Tibetans were Chinese , and he certainly would not have granted them independence if his Nationalists had won the civil war . 
If Tibetan Buddhism was severely damaged , Chinese Communism has barely survived the ravages of the twentieth century , either . 
But capitalist development has been even more devastating to Tibetan tradition . 
Like many modern imperialist powers , China claims legitimacy for its policies by pointing to their material benefits . 
After decades of destruction and neglect , Tibet has benefited from enormous amounts of Chinese money and energy to modernize the country . 
The Tibetans cannot complain that they have been left behind in China &apos;s transformation from a Third World wreck to a marvel of supercharged urban development . 
But the price in Tibet has been higher than elsewhere . 
Regional identity , cultural diversity , and traditional arts and customs have been buried under concrete , steel , and glass all over China . 
But at least the Han Chinese can feel pride in the revival of their national fortunes . 
They can bask in the resurgence of Chinese power and material wealth . 
The Tibetans , by contrast , can share this feeling only to the extent that they become fully Chinese . 
If not , they can only lament the loss of their own identity . 
The Chinese have exported their version of modern development to Tibet not only in terms of architecture and infrastructure , but also people - wave after wave of them : businessmen from Sichuan , prostitutes from Hunan , technocrats from Beijing , party officials from Shanghai , and shopkeepers from Yunnan . 
The majority of Lhasa &apos;s population today is no longer Tibetan . 
Most people in rural areas are Tibetan , but their way of life is not likely to survive Chinese modernization any more than the Apaches &quot; way of life survived in the United States . 
Since Chinese is the language of instruction at Tibetan schools and universities , anyone who wishes to be more than a poor peasant , beggar , or seller of trinkets must conform to Chinese norms , that is , become Chinese . 
Even Tibetan intellectuals who want to study their own classical literature must do so in Chinese translation . 
Meanwhile , Chinese and other foreign tourists dress up in traditional Tibetan dress to have their souvenir pictures taken in front of the Dalai Lama &apos;s old palace . 
Religion is now tolerated in Tibet , as it is in the rest of China , but under strictly controlled conditions . 
Monasteries and temples are exploited as tourist attractions , while government agents try to ensure that the monks stay in line . 
As we know from the recent events , they have not yet been entirely successful ; the resentment among Tibetans runs too deep . 
In the last few weeks , that resentment boiled over , first in the monasteries , and then in the streets , against the Han Chinese migrants , who are both the agents and main beneficiaries of rapid modernization . 
The Dalai Lama has repeatedly said that he does not seek independence . 
However , as long as Tibet remains part of China , it is hard to see how its distinct cultural identity can survive . 
The human and material forces arrayed against Tibet are overwhelming . 
There are too few Tibetans , and too many Chinese . 
Outside Tibet , however , it is a different story . 
If the Chinese are responsible for extinguishing the old way of life inside Tibet , they may be unintentionally responsible for keeping it alive outside . 
By forcing the Dalai Lama into exile , they have ensured the establishment of a Tibetan diaspora society , which might well survive in a more traditional form than would have been likely even in an independent Tibet . 
Diaspora cultures thrive on nostalgic dreams of return . 
Traditions are jealously guarded , like precious heirlooms , to be passed on as long as those dreams persist . 
And who is to say that such dreams will never come true ? 
The Jews managed to hang on to theirs for almost 2,000 years .
