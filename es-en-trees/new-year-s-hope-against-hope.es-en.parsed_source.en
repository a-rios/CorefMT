New Year &apos;s Hope against Hope 
NEW YORK - The time has come for New Year &apos;s resolutions , a moment of reflection . 
When the last year hasn &apos;t gone so well , it is a time for hope that the next year will be better . 
For Europe and the United States , 2010 was a year of disappointment . 
It &apos;s been three years since the bubble broke , and more than two since Lehman Brothers &quot; collapse . 
In 2009 , we were pulled back from the brink of depression , and 2010 was supposed to be the year of transition : as the economy got back on its feet , stimulus spending could smoothly be brought down . 
Growth , it was thought , might slow slightly in 2011 , but it would be a minor bump on the way to robust recovery . 
We could then look back at the Great Recession as a bad dream ; the market economy - supported by prudent government action - would have shown its resilience . 
In fact , 2010 was a nightmare . 
The crises in Ireland and Greece called into question the euro &apos;s viability and raised the prospect of a debt default . 
On both sides of the Atlantic , unemployment remained stubbornly high , at around 10 % . 
Even though 10 % of US households with mortgages had already lost their homes , the pace of foreclosures appeared to be increasing - or would have , were it not for legal snafus that raised doubts about America &apos;s vaunted &quot; rule of law . &quot; 
Unfortunately , the New Year &apos;s resolutions made in Europe and America were the wrong ones . 
The response to the private-sector failures and profligacy that had caused the crisis was to demand public-sector austerity ! 
The consequence will almost surely be a slower recovery and an even longer delay before unemployment falls to acceptable levels . 
There will also be a decline in competitiveness . 
While China has kept its economy going by making investments in education , technology , and infrastructure , Europe and America have been cutting back . 
It has become fashionable among politicians to preach the virtues of pain and suffering , no doubt because those bearing the brunt of it are those with little voice - the poor and future generations . 
To get the economy going , some people will , in fact , have to bear some pain , but the increasingly skewed income distribution gives clear guidance to whom this should be : Approximately a quarter of all income in the US now goes to the top 1 % , while most Americans &quot; income is lower today than it was a dozen years ago . 
Simply put , most Americans didn &apos;t share in what many called the Great Moderation , but was really the Mother of All Bubbles . 
So , should innocent victims and those who gained nothing from fake prosperity really be made to pay even more ? 
Europe and America have the same talented people , the same resources , and the same capital that they had before the recession . 
They may have overvalued some of these assets ; but the assets are , by and large , still there . 
Private financial markets misallocated capital on a massive scale in the years before the crisis , and the waste resulting from underutilization of resources has been even greater since the crisis began . 
The question is , how do we get these resources back to work ? 
Debt restructuring - writing down the debts of homeowners and , in some cases , governments - will be key . 
It will eventually happen . 
Banks never wanted to admit to their bad loans , and now they don &apos;t want to recognize the losses , at least not until they can adequately recapitalize themselves through their trading profits and the large spread between their high lending rates and rock-bottom borrowing costs . 
The financial sector will press governments to ensure full repayment , even when it leads to massive social waste , huge unemployment , and high social distress - and even when it is a consequence of their own mistakes in lending . 
No one would wish the trauma that Argentina went through in 1999-2002 on any other country . 
But the country also suffered in the years before the crisis - years of IMF bailouts and austerity -from high unemployment and poverty rates and low and negative growth . 
Since the debt restructuring and currency devaluation , Argentina has had years of extraordinarily rapid GDP growth , with the annual rate averaging nearly 9 % from 2003 to 2007 . 
By 2009 , national income was twice what it was at the nadir of the crisis , in 2002 , and more than 75 % above its pre-crisis peak . 
Likewise , Argentina &apos;s poverty rate has fallen by some three-quarters from its crisis peak , and the country weathered the global financial crisis far better than the US did -unemployment is high , but still only around 8 % . 
We could only conjecture what would have happened if it had not postponed the day of reckoning for so long - or if it had tried to put it off further . 
So this is my hope for the New Year : we stop paying attention to the so-called financial wizards who got us into this mess - and who are now calling for austerity and delayed restructuring - and start using a little common sense . 
If there is pain to be borne , the brunt of it should be felt by those responsible for the crisis , and those who benefited most from the bubble that preceded it .
