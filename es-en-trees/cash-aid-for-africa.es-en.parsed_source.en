Cash Aid for Africa 
STOCKHOLM - Europe has made an ambitious commitment to scale up its aid to Africa , and Africa &apos;s challenges call for that greater engagement . 
But boosting aid to countries that are already aid-dependent requires clearer delivery mechanisms and a degree of budgetary predictability . 
Something new is called for , and cash transfers directly to poor people could be an alternative − but only as a part of a longer-term vision of partner countries &quot; welfare systems . 
The European Union has committed itself and its member states to increase aid flows to 0.56 % of GDP by 2010 and 0.7 % by 2015 − with a big focus on Africa . 
The combined aid commitments of OECD Development Assistance Committee member countries would mean a doubling of official development assistance to Africa between 2004 and 2010 - that is , if they are honored . 
It is , after all , fair to question whether donor countries will stick to these commitments and , indeed , whether conditions in partner countries will permit them to . 
But a theoretical doubling of African aid by 2010 − with the possibility of even more after that − offers a huge opportunity to combat poverty . 
So tackling any obstacles that could inhibit the effective application of these additional resources is a priority . 
While Africa &apos;s needs are relatively well known , there are challenges in scaling up aid to tackle them . 
This reflects such problems as macroeconomic management , aid-dependency syndromes , absorption capacity , transaction costs , and − related to all of it − the risk of decreasing returns as aid levels rise . 
Given the current aid-to-GDP ratios in sub-Saharan Africa − with approximately half of countries yielding ratios of above 10 % even before future increases in aid are taken into account − these challenges must be taken seriously . 
Donors and their partners agree on a way forward that could , in theory , tackle these challenges . 
The agreement is contained in the so-called Paris Agenda , which defines principles of ownership , alignment , and harmonization . 
It calls for the improved predictability of aid flows , with budget support and program-based aid as the preferred means of delivering support . 
It is an agenda for improved partnerships , reduced transaction costs , and increased efficiency . 
It is when the Paris Agenda leaves theory and confronts reality that problems emerge . 
Budget support suffers from low credibility , not only among donor taxpayers , but also among citizens in recipient countries . 
While it assumes predictable financial flows , such predictability can be spurious . 
After all , neither donor countries nor their partners are exempt from such problems as corruption , political crises , armed conflicts , human rights abuses , vested interests , or international power politics . 
As a result , placing so many eggs in one basket leaves the business of aid provision looking increasingly risky . 
Furthermore , budget support that &apos;s linked to national poverty-reduction strategies also rests on the questionable assumption that the political economy of a partner country works to the benefit of the poorest . 
Politics on the donor side is no less complicated , with growing aid budgets often viewed by taxpayers as excessive at a time when the anti-aid lobby is becoming more vocal . 
When donors finance 50 % or more of a country &apos;s national budget , they may sometimes find intervention unavoidable − donors certainly have the power to intervene . 
That could mean more conditions being placed on aid , not fewer − even if the rhetoric sometimes appears to suggest the opposite . 
Would dispensing aid by making cash transfers directly to the poorest work better ? 
Experimental schemes have been implemented in Latin America in which child allowances are conditional on school attendance and vaccination . 
Cash aid has sometimes replaced food aid in humanitarian crisis situations , and there have been targeted social protection schemes in Zambia , as well as incipient welfare schemes for the elderly in India , South Africa , and Lesotho . 
The results so far are very promising . 
Poor people spend money reasonably effectively on investment as well as on consumption . 
Food and other basic goods are bought - benefiting the local economy - nutrition improves , and kids attend school for longer . 
An unconditional child grant scheme in South Africa − with mothers as recipients − even demonstrated the impact in centimeters , because the height-for-age index among children improved in relation to control groups . 
Affordability does not appear to be a big hurdle . 
Assume , for example , that an annual universal grant of $ 50 is given to all children below 10 years of age in Mozambique , Malawi , and Zambia − covering roughly 10 million children . 
These are three low-income countries with HIV prevalence rates of roughly 15 % . 
Further assuming a relatively generous 20 % administration overhead , the total cost of the scheme would be approximately $ 600 million - equivalent to a fifth of the reported aid flow to these countries in 2004 and to 3.5-4 % of their combined GDP . 
It would certainly be costly , but not out of reach if African aid is doubled . 
For cash-transfer schemes to work , they must be regular , predictable , and long term . 
But , while donors and their taxpayers might be willing to make long-term commitments for such a purpose , there is likely to be rather less appetite for making commitments which would seem to be never-ending . 
A formula for burden sharing would be needed that gradually increases domestic financing . 
But under no circumstances should these schemes be established as purely donor-driven mechanisms that bypass local budgets and institutions . 
Partner countries must be ready to invest in their institutions and develop their own vision of how they want to organize their welfare systems . 
Would African partners want this ? 
Maybe . 
In any case , the cash-transfer debate is no longer limited to those in northern development circles . 
It has now reached the agenda of some African governments and the African Union .
