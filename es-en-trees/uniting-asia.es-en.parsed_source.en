Uniting Asia 
North Korea &apos;s nuclear ambitions seem to have died down , at least for now . 
The Six-Party Talks have , at long last , succeeded - thanks , apparently , to China &apos;s solid opposition to the nuclearization of northeast Asia . 
Under the aegis of the Six-Party umbrella , the United States and North Korea have even held the bilateral talks that North Korea &apos;s Kim Jong Il has long coveted . 
So , for now , northeast Asia is temporarily calmer and less unstable than it has been for almost two decades . 
Yet it remains a potential flashpoint . 
During this time of tension , an increasingly self-confident South Korea began to chart a course independent of its American patron . 
In November 2005 , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) accused the South Korean government of having enriched a tiny amount of uranium - to a level close to what could be used in an atomic weapon . 
The government denied this , claiming that the experiments were conducted without its knowledge by academic researchers &quot; for scientific interest . &quot; 
South Korea &apos;s evolving foreign policy also may involve moving closer to China , as Korean nationalists join the Chinese in resisting Japan &apos;s rival claims to potential hydrocarbon deposits in the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan . 
New generations of South Koreans , who have no personal recollections of - and perhaps only casual interest in - the Korean War , apparently resent what they regard as America &apos;s undermining South Korea &apos;s &quot; sunshine policy &quot; toward North Korea . 
For Japan , North Korea &apos;s missile capability is the most immediate concern . 
A sweeping defense review that Japan recently carried out reaffirms that it will continue to oppose its immediate neighbors &quot; possession of nuclear arms . 
Of course , Japan itself already possesses both nuclear technology and solid-fuel missiles . 
All in all , the calmer situation in Northeast Asia might seem to be a fragile basis for creating long-term peace and prosperity in the region . 
But the basic lesson from Western Europe , whose greatest powers , France and Germany , fought three great wars in 70 years , is that the only lasting solution to conflict is to embed neighboring countries in dense networks of economic , political , and security relationships , and in regional institutions that serve their mutual interests . 
Of course , the creators of today &apos;s united Europe did not start by calling for national sovereignty to be abrogated . 
Indeed , Robert Schuman once declared that &quot; Europe will not be built in a day , nor as part of an overall design . 
Accordingly , what became the European Union started inconspicuously , with the integration of French and German industries that had been most directly associated with war production - coal and steel . 
Only after economic integration had progressed did the first serious efforts at political integration take place . 
In today &apos;s East Asia , too , the market is fostering integration . 
Now that the 10 southeast Asian states have been gathered into ASEAN - and are promulgating an ASEAN Charter - the concept of an East Asian Economic Grouping ( EAEG ) that would incorporate ASEAN and China , Japan , and ( a presumably unified and nuclear-free ) Korea is moving forward steadily . 
The initial phase of this grand ambition , a free-trade area ( FTA ) between ASEAN and China , began in 2004 and should be completed by 2010 . 
Concurrently , an FTA comprising ASEAN , Japan , and also with South Korea is being negotiated . 
Since 2005 , India , too , has expressed interest in such an arrangement with ASEAN-10 . 
But northeast Asia , alone among the Asian regions , has no regional organization . 
This is why it needs a concert of powers to sustain its fragile stability . 
North and South Korea must begin the work of reconciliation and community-building on their own initiative , as France and Germany did in 1952 . 
Economics must once again outflank politics , with trade , investment , tourism , and technology transfer intensifying across the 38th Parallel . 
Meanwhile , the instruments for a larger Asia-Pacific economic community are already in place , starting with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum , with the ultimate goal being to meet the imperative for durable peace and security . 
Over the next decade , our statesmen must replace the Pax Americana that has enforced stability in the Asia-Pacific region with a Pax Asia-Pacifica , in which the major countries and sub-regional blocs contribute to and share in the maintenance of Asia-Pacific security in the face of our common geopolitical threats . 
As regional neighbors and partners , we should exploit the convergence of interests that the US , Japan , China , India , Russia , ASEAN , Canada , a unified , nuclear weapon-free Korea , Pakistan , Australia-New Zealand , and others share - just as Western European exploited the Cold War stalemate between the US and the Soviet Union to consolidate and expand the EU . 
America &apos;s overstretched military provides the irrefutable rationale for a deep restructuring of Asia-Pacific security . 
Clearly , this will involve burden-sharing by all nations in the Asia-Pacific region , and a cooperative understanding among the most affluent and powerful countries in our part of the world - the US , Japan , China , and South Korea .
