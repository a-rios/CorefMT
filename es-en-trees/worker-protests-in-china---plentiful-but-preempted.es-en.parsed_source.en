Worker Protests In China : Plentiful But Preempted 
The last annualized figure for labor protests that Beijing was willing to announce publicly was 100,000 for the year 1999 . 
But a 2001 internal report from the Ministry of Public Security disclosed that the numbers &quot; began a rise like a violent wind &quot; from 1997 , the year of the Communist Party &apos;s Fifteenth Congress , which pressed for factory firings in the name of &quot; efficiency . &quot; 
While the government is determined to keep news of all disturbances out of the media - or at least downplay their size and disruptiveness - it has been possible to collect information on nearly 200 separate events occurring between 1994 and 2004 , some from news sources in Hong Kong , some from the Western media , and a few from Chinese publications . 
They all exhibit the same , unchanging pattern : the government , whether in Beijing or the localities , tolerates the low-decibel , smaller-scale , relatively non-disruptive marches and sit-ins by demonstrators bearing petitions and posters , especially if they appear to be spontaneous , un-organized , localized and leaderless . 
The incidents loom substantially more dangerous to the political elite if they seem to have been mobilized by dissidents , are marked by some measure of violence , threaten to spread , or entail the obstruction of major transport trunklines . 
Indeed , the episodes that make it into the media beyond the Mainland are usually such protests . 
What is sparking so much unrest in a country usually depicted as daily growing more affluent ? 
Generally the causes are these : unpaid wages and pensions ; sudden and massive job terminations ; and management corruption held responsible for the bankruptcy of industrial enterprises - where discharged workers were secure , enjoying privileges and benefits , since the 1950s . 
Job losses in the range of 60 million have suddenly rendered nearly an eighth of the urban populace indigent . 
Often without a dependable channel for airing their grievances , hordes of laid-off workers and retired folk have filled the avenues over the past decade or so . 
Doesn &apos;t the government mind if so much of its urban populace is sinking into poverty and becoming disaffected ? 
Why is this stability-obsessed regime allowing so much instability ? 
In fact , the leaders are terribly uneasy about the situation and discuss it frequently . 
But there is also a compensatory effort that has absorbed much of the energy of the bureaucracies for labor and social security , and for civil affairs . 
For 2004 , the central government allocated some 78 billion yuan for laid-off workers and the poor , with localities also upping their outlays . 
But the sad truth is that probably only about a quarter of those pushed out of their plants ever received assistance . 
For those who have , however , this policy has nipped discontent in the bud . 
Additionally , there have been attempts to create new posts , develop labor-intensive industries and small and medium sized firms , promote the private sector , and encourage service jobs , plus offering occupational training : the government allocated an additional 4.7 billion yuan expressly for job creation in 2004 . 
These policies mitigate the pain of job loss for their recipients . 
Promotion of the law also aims at alleviating anger . 
As workers &apos; consciousness of their rights increases , they are gradually more and more apt to appeal grievances to the courts : from 1995 to 2001 , adjudicated labor disputes rose from 28,000 to 101,000 . 
Offering workers legal redress has turned their attention temporarily from the streets to mediation and may well have reduced the number of street demonstrations . 
Other initiatives are a program of allowances , training and placement for the laid-off ; unemployment insurance ( which , unfortunately , depends on the economic health of the firm to which a worker was once attached ) ; and pension reform - having similar problems . 
There is also a scheme to supply a &quot; minimum livelihood guarantee &quot; to the desperately poor . 
Recipients numbered over 20 million as of early 2004 , when 15 billion yuan was budgeted for the program ( with the central government contributing a full 60 % ) . 
Protest in China has spun upward dramatically in recent years , in numbers , scale , and organization . 
But overall , increasing responsiveness - if clearly not in a democratic mode - has managed to maintain the instability that does exist at a level and within a scope that marks a game of unwritten rules  -  one of complainants confining their choler within understood bounds and of the government watchful over an ever-simmering stew .
