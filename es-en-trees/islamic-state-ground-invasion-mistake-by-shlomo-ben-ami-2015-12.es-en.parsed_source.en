Blinded By ISIS 
MADRID - The general consensus emerging since last month &apos;s carnage in Paris seems to be that the Islamic State ( ISIS ) can be defeated only by a ground invasion of its &quot; state . &quot; 
This is a delusion . 
Even if the West and its local allies ( the Kurds , the Syrian opposition , Jordan , and other Sunni Arab countries ) could agree about who would provide the bulk of ground troops , ISIS has already reshaped its strategy . 
It is now a global organization with local franchised groups capable of wreaking havoc in Western capitals . 
In fact , ISIS has always been a symptom of a deeper malady . 
Disintegration in the Arab Middle East reflects the region &apos;s failure to find a path between the bankrupt , secular nationalism that has dominated its state system since independence and a radical brand of Islam at war with modernity . 
The fundamental problem consists in an existential struggle between utterly dysfunctional states and an obscenely savage brand of theocratic fanaticism . 
With that struggle , in which most of the region &apos;s regimes have exhausted their already-limited stores of legitimacy , a century-old regional order is collapsing . 
Indeed , Israel , Iran , and Turkey - all non-Arab-majority countries - are probably the region &apos;s only genuinely cohesive nation-states . 
For years , key states in the region - some of them , like Saudi Arabia and Qatar , darlings of the West - have essentially paid protection money to jihadists . 
Yes , America &apos;s wars in the region - as destructive as they were stupid - bear a substantial part of the blame for the mayhem now engulfing the Fertile Crescent . 
But that does not exculpate the Arab fundamentalist monarchies for their role in reviving the seventh-century vision that ISIS ( and others ) seek to realize . 
ISIS &apos;s army of psychopaths and adventurers was launched as a &quot; startup &quot; by Sunni magnates in the Gulf who envied Iran &apos;s success with its Lebanese Shia proxy , Hezbollah . 
It was the combination of an idea and the money to propagate it that created this monster and nurtured its ambition to forge a totalitarian caliphate . 
For years , the Wahhabis of Arabia have been the fountainhead of Islamist radicalism and the primary backer and facilitator of extremist groups throughout the region . 
As former US Senator Bob Graham , the lead author of the classified Senate report on the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 , put it earlier this year , &quot; ISIS is a product of Saudi ideals &quot; and &quot; Saudi money . &quot; 
Indeed , Wikileaks quotes former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accusing Qatar and Saudi Arabia of collusion &quot; with Al Qaeda , the Taliban , and other terrorist groups . &quot; 
That raises an obvious question : When regimes in the region collaborate with terrorist groups , how can intelligence cooperation with them , let alone a coalition to fight Islamic extremism , be credible ? 
The so-called pro-Western regimes in the Arab Middle East simply do not see eye to eye with the West about the meaning and implications of the war on terror , or even about what violent radicalism is . 
That is just one reason why an invasion of the caliphate , with local armies supported by Western airstrikes , could have devastating unintended consequences - think of George W. Bush &apos;s invasion of Iraq . 
Indeed , even if such a division of labor could be agreed , a ground invasion that denies ISIS its territorial base in Iraq and Syria would merely push it to redeploy in a region that is collapsing into various no man &apos;s lands . 
At that point , &quot; Caliph &quot; Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , or some future would-be caliph , would invariably fuse the region &apos;s mounting governance chaos with a global jihadi campaign - a process that , as we have seen in Paris and elsewhere , has already started . 
The ideological and strategic rift between ISIS and Al Qaeda notwithstanding , an alliance against the common enemy - the incumbent Arab regimes and the West - cannot be entirely discounted . 
Osama Bin Laden himself never ruled out the idea of establishing a caliphate . 
Indeed , his terrorism was perceived as a prelude to it . 
At the same time , Syria and Iran might exploit the inevitable chaos to expand their presence in Iraq , and all parties , including Turkey , would oppose a central role for the Kurds . 
The latter have proven themselves to be tremendously reliable and capable fighters , as the battles to liberate the cities of Kobani and Sinjar from ISIS control have shown . 
But no one should think that they can be the West &apos;s tool for subduing the Sunni heartland of Iraq and Syria . 
Nor is it clear that the West is capable of compensating the Kurds with full-fledged statehood . 
The geostrategic constraints that have prevented Kurdish independence for centuries are even more acute today . 
Some of the consequences of a Western-backed Arab invasion of the caliphate are no less predictable for being &quot; unintended . &quot; 
It would eventually stir up mass sympathy for the caliphate throughout the region , thus providing ISIS with a propaganda victory and further inspiration for alienated young Muslims in Europe and elsewhere to fight the &quot; Crusaders &quot; and the Muslim &quot; traitors &quot; aligned with them . 
The only realistic alternative is more - much more - of the same . 
That means a constant and resolute effort to stop the caliphate &apos;s expansion , cut off its sources of finance , deepen and expand intelligence cooperation among credible allies , end the oil-rich monarchies &quot; collusion with terrorist groups , and encourage reform ( without engaging in grand state-building projects ) . 
The Arab Middle East is not susceptible to quick fixes . 
It requires profound indigenous change that might take the better part of this century to produce . 
For now , turning the caliphate into yet another failed state in the region seems to be the best possible outcome .
