What Does America Want ? 
When the leaders of the world &apos;s richest nations gather in Evian , France , one unasked question will dominate : what does America want in the world ? 
So it may be helpful to outline the principles and ideas that guide US foreign policy . 
First , inconsistency is no vice . 
Indeed , in foreign policymaking , inconsistency is often a virtue . 
I speak not of principles , but of policy . 
The US does not have a &quot; one size fits all &quot; approach to the world . 
What happened in Iraq should not be over ‑ interpreted as a rigid template for US policy toward countries that pursue weapons of mass destruction , support terrorism , or deny people liberty . 
In Iraq , the US used force as a last resort , against a country with a clear record of aggression , and after a large degree of international consensus had developed about what Iraq needed to do . 
Different policies-tailored for local , regional , and international realities-will be needed to meet the challenges posed by North Korea , Iran , Syria , or elsewhere . 
America &apos;s armed forces are an essential background to much of what the US accomplishes internationally . 
But defense policy is only one component of foreign policy . 
Not every threat to America &apos;s national interests can be addressed with military power . 
If all you have to work with is a hammer , as the saying goes , every problem looks like a nail . 
Success in foreign policy , as in carpentry , requires the right tools for the job . 
Partnership is essential here . 
For all of America &apos;s power , there is little that the US can do in the world that it can &apos;t do better with the active participation of others , be they governments , international organizations , or non-governmental organizations . 
Partnership facilitates solutions to problems that defy purely national responses and means that burdens are shared . 
America relies on partnerships in the global war on terrorism : foreign governments provide intelligence and law enforcement cooperation ; trading partners ensure the security of shipping containers ; private financial institutions help track the transfers of funds that sustain terror networks . 
Beyond partnerships , international institutions add value-provided they are effectively organized , have realistic mandates , and contain members that are committed to common norms and aims . 
Such institutions can and often do advance US national interests . 
Indeed , it would be difficult to carry out critical dimensions of US foreign policy-from trade to non ‑ proliferation to environmental policy-without them . 
The World Trade Organization is a case in point . 
It provides a forum in which to negotiate new trade liberalization agreements , seek remedies against protectionist and discriminatory policies , and resolve disputes with trading partners . 
But the US must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities . 
NATO , for example , is evolving from a Cold War alliance focused solely on Europe to one suited to meeting today &apos;s security challenges wherever they may arise , such as in Afghanistan and possibly Iraq . 
Multilateralism is most successful when built on a real convergence of interests and values . 
The UN and other global frameworks may sometimes be best placed to address US foreign policy goals . 
When the UN or other bodies are unwilling or unable to move against dire threats , America reserves the right to act in less encompassing alliances or flexible , ad hoc coalitions of the willing . 
Not even the UN has a monopoly on legitimacy , which depends most on an action &apos;s rationale and the manner in which it is undertaken . 
This flexibility is needed because of the nature of the challenges that loom on the horizon . 
We ignore failing states at our peril , because anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and can offer a haven for terrorists , criminals , and drug traffickers . 
One of our most pressing tasks today is to prevent the implosion of weak states . 
Another is to assist countries that have collapsed into violence to begin the slow process of recovery . 
One impulse behind America &apos;s international engagement , and one of the great sources of its global power , has been its enduring impulse to make the world a better place . 
Any US foreign policy must combine interests and values , because the American public always insists that US national objectives be linked to national ideals . 
The appeal of US leadership abroad rests in part on the attractiveness of America &apos;s political institutions , society , and culture , and its willingness to champion human rights and democracy . 
At the same time , our efforts to promote democracy worldwide serve US interests , owing to the hardheaded realization that democracies settle their differences peaceably . 
Today &apos;s world lacks irreconcilable conflict among the main concentrations of world power : Europe , Russia , China , Japan , and the US . 
This congruence of interest and agreement on the rules of international order offers a promising foundation for managing the common challenges that confront us all . 
Our over ‑ riding goal should be to create a world in which governments , organizations , and peoples embrace arrangements that allow them to realize their shared interests and that reflect fundamental universal values . 
Everyone has an interest in a world in which force is used only as a last resort , terrorism is regarded as beyond the pale , weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used , free trade becomes the norm , citizens enjoy basic liberties , democratic values triumph , and the rule of law replaces the way of the gun . 
Bringing such an integrated world may be optimistic , even idealistic , but it is hardly naive .
