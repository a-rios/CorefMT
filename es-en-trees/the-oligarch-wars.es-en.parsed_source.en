The Oligarch Wars 
I am in no position to be dispassionate about President Vladimir Putin &apos;s war against Russia &apos;s &quot; oligarchs , &quot; the class of men and women ( yes , there are some , the wife of Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzkov being the most prominent ) who control the country &apos;s most lucrative companies and natural-resource assets . 
How can I be neutral , as I am usually counted among them ? 
But an insiders &quot; perspective is valuable nonetheless , for only an insider knows what is really being done behind the scenes . 
Having been a target of Putin &apos;s &quot; war , &quot; I can speak of it in very concrete terms . 
Because I was forced to leave Russia and defend myself from the Kremlin while in exile in England , I know how the entire repressive power of a state can be brought to bear on a single man . 
Such a thing could not happen in a Western democracy . 
Can anyone imagine the workings of the entire French state - the police , the security services , the military , and the bureaucracy - being coordinated to secure the imprisonment of a lone individual ? 
In Russia , it is more than imaginable . 
For years , the whole force of the Russian state has worked relentlessly to ensure my extradition to Russia in order to portray me as a criminal . 
It took me three years in a London court to prove that I was being prosecuted for purely political reasons . 
The British authorities ruled that I was to be given asylum - a decision that fortunately is not being challenged in Russia . 
At least some in the Kremlin realize that not all courts exist merely to do the bidding of those in power . 
Putin &apos;s war against the oligarchs is sometimes interpreted as a fight against separate individuals or against ill-gotten wealth . 
In fact , it is a war against independent people with the wherewithal to stand up and be counted . 
The fight began with the parliamentary elections of 2003 , when independent politicians were systematically stifled . 
I may disagree with the liberal Grigory Yavlinsky and his Yabloko Party , or with Anatoly Chubais ( who continues to serve Russia by heading the national electricity company ) , but both faced insurmountable obstacles to gaining seats in the State Duma ( the lower house of parliament ) . 
They were kept out of parliament because , in truth , they represent more than themselves ; they stand for people who sincerely wish to defend the idea of a &quot; liberal Russia , &quot; a country that is free and democratic . 
They were basically destroyed politically - scared away , fired from various jobs , or forced to leave the country . 
There is more than a whiff of hypocrisy in Putin &apos;s anti-oligarch campaigns . 
Among the people persecuting the oligarchs , I haven &apos;t met one who isn &apos;t trying to become an oligarch himself . 
Indeed , Putin &apos;s treasured KGB cronies , who are supposed to be such ascetic hard men , all seem to be marrying their government jobs with lucrative posts in state-owned enterprises . 
The infamous Igor Sechin , the Cardinal Richelieu of Putin &apos;s Kremlin , somehow also manages to have time to be the chairman of Rosneft , the big state oil concern . 
Two conditions marked Russia &apos;s oligarchs for persecution . 
First , they could foresee the future more clearly than others . 
So when everybody thought that Russia was about to become a market economy , they had seen that the turn had already happened - and so were miles ahead of the game . 
Second , having quickly established their businesses , they had the will to get involved in politics at critical moments , and ruthlessly to defend the political system that they felt was needed for capitalism to survive in Russia . 
Boris Yeltsin &apos;s re-election in 1996 was such a moment . 
Unfortunately , at a certain moment , some oligarchs started explaining themselves . 
Mikhail Khodorkovsky , the jailed boss of Yukos Oil , for example , began to repent his actions publicly in order to please the Kremlin . 
Although I hate to be critical of a man unjustly imprisoned , his example shows that most of the oligarchs lacked the toughness to defend the political system in which they believed . 
They bickered among themselves and fell into a trap . 
That trap was the phony belief that capital and power can be made separate . 
But such a wall of separation does not exist in true democracies . 
On the contrary , wealthy people and businesses in countries throughout the world compete with each other and with other interest groups for political access and influence . 
Indeed , such political action makes for responsible wealth . 
For only in this way is great wealth made a healthy and organic part of the country &apos;s political and social life . 
So , if Putin wins his war against the oligarchs , it will be a Pyrrhic victory : wealth will be more than intimidated ; it will become purely a creature and plaything of power .
