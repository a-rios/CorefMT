Two and a Half Cheers for the Mediterranean Union 
Maybe it is time to be a bit more generous to French President Nicolas Sarkozy and look at the outcome of what he does rather than the way that he does it . 
The original launch of the Mediterranean Union almost sank the whole enterprise . 
Appearing to speak without giving the issue much thought , Sarkozy initially proposed a club of European and mostly Arab states along the Mediterranean &apos;s shore . 
It would have been in essence a French-run enterprise that the rest of Europe would have paid for . 
This did not go down well , particularly with the Germans . 
There was also a strong suspicion that the French were trying to find a way to buy off Turkey with a relationship falling well short of European Union membership . 
So the auguries for an attempt to revitalize Europe &apos;s relationship with its Mediterranean partners were not good . 
But by the time of the grand Paris Summit in July to send the new club on its way , the initial suspicions had largely been overcome . 
Sarkozy bowed to his European critics and enjoyed a diplomatic triumph . 
We shall soon see whether there is substance to the initiative , or whether it is just a coat of fresh paint on an old and tired idea . 
The original Barcelona Process , launched in 1995 , was an excellent scheme . 
Intended to provide an economic and political backdrop to peace-making through confidence-building in the Middle East , it was an admirable recognition of Europe &apos;s historical , commercial , cultural , and political ties with its neighbors to the south of the sea which has brought us all together over the years . 
There were aspirations for a free-trade area by 2010 . 
There were pledges of political integration based on shared values . 
There were people-to-people links . 
There was a forum where Israelis and their long-term Arab foes could sit together and discuss other matters than the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . 
There was a development budget . 
And there were meetings . 
So many meetings . 
The effort was far from worthless . 
Development projects were funded through grants or cheap loans , and these have probably played at least some part in increasing the attractiveness of the Maghreb and the Mashraq to foreign investors . 
There was some lowering of agricultural and other tariffs by the EU . 
Dialogue on political reform , and euros to support it , helped further the process in some countries , notably Morocco and Jordan . 
There was some co-operation on common problems like drugs and illegal immigration . 
But , as a significant component of Europe &apos;s policy toward its most crucial neighbors , the successes of the Barcelona Process were modest : a great idea on the launch pad had difficulty getting off the ground . 
So Sarkozy deserves at least two and a half cheers for trying to revitalize it . 
But if the Mediterranean Union is to achieve more than was managed in its first manifestation , a number of things will need to happen . 
First , Europe is better at talking about free-trade areas than delivering free trade . 
For example , there are still too many barriers to agricultural trade between the North and the South . 
And guess which country leads the opposition to any significant opening up of European agriculture . 
Step forward , France , and take a bow . 
Second , however slow we have been in opening up a real Mediterranean market , the barriers to freer trade between Arab League countries are just as great . 
Third , it was excellent that in Paris Sarkozy began the process of bringing Syria in out of the diplomatic cold . 
We must also hope that his attempts to act as a peace-broker between West Bank Palestinians and Israel are blessed with success . 
But the truth is that Europe , for all the gallant efforts of Javier Solana , has been absent from serious politics in the Middle East . 
We have not dared to cross America . 
A largely non-existent European policy toward the region has been dictated by the absentee monopolists of policy in Washington . 
Europe should get more seriously involved , even at the risk of occasionally irritating America , which may be less likely to happen once the Bush administration is history . 
For a start , we should recognize that there will be no political settlement in Palestine without including Hamas . 
What would incredibly have been former British Prime Minister Tony Blair &apos;s first visit to Gaza in his first year of peace-making had to be canceled recently because of security concerns . 
Enough said . 
Finally , Europe has to decide how serious it is about all the admirable stuff in the Barcelona Process on pluralism , civil society , the rule of law , and democracy . 
Is Europe serious that a shared concept of human rights should be one of the foundations of our Mediterranean partnership ? 
If so , what are we in Europe proposing to do about it ? 
If this is just blah-blah , better not say it . 
We discredit ourselves and important principles when we say things that we do not mean .
