Can the Elephant Dance with the Dragon ? 
TRIVANDRUM , INDIA - It is fashionable these days , particularly in the West , to speak of India and China in the same breath . 
These are the two big countries said to be taking over the world , the new contenders for global eminence after centuries of Western domination , the Oriental answer to generations of Occidental economic success . 
Indeed , two new books explicitly twin the two countries : Robyn Meredith &apos;s The Elephant and the Dragon : The Rise of India and China and What It Means for All of Us and Harvard business professor Tarun Khanna &apos;s Billions of Entrepreneurs : How China and India are Reshaping their Futures - and Yours . 
Both books view the recent rise of India and China as shifting the world &apos;s economic and political tectonic plates . 
Some even speak of &quot; Chindia , &quot; as if the two were joined at the hip in the international imagination . 
Count me among the skeptics . 
It is not just that China and India have little in common , save for the fact that they occupy a rather vast landmass called &quot; Asia . &quot; 
It is also that they are already at very different stages of development . 
China started its liberalization a decade and a half before India , hit double-digit growth when India was still hovering around 5 % , and , with compound growth , has put itself in a totally different economic league from India , continuing to grow faster from a larger base . 
Moreover , the two countries &quot; systems are totally dissimilar . 
If China wants to build a new six-lane expressway , it can bulldoze its way through any village in its path . 
In India , if you want to widen a two-lane road , you could be tied up in court for a dozen years over compensation entitlements . 
When China built the Three Gorges dam , it created a 660-kilometer long reservoir that necessitated displacing two million people - all accomplished in 15 years without a fuss in the interest of generating electricity . 
When India began the Narmada Dam project , aiming to bring irrigation , drinking water , and power to millions , it spent 34 years ( so far ) fighting environmental groups , human rights activists , and advocates for the displaced all the way to the Supreme Court , while still being thwarted in the streets by protesters . 
That is how it should be : India is a fractious democracy , China is not . 
But , as an Indian , I do not wish to pretend that we can compete in the global growth stakes with China . 
But if we can &apos;t compete , can we co-operate ? 
The two civilizations had centuries of contact in ancient times . 
Thanks mainly to the export of Buddhism from India to China , Chinese came to Indian universities , visited Indian courts , and wrote memorable accounts of their voyages . 
Nalanda received hundreds of Chinese students in its time , and a few Indians went the other way ; a Buddhist monk from India built the famous Lingyin Si temple in Huangzhou in the fifth century . 
Southwest India &apos;s Kerala coastline is dotted with Chinese-style fishing nets , and the favorite cooking pot of the Malayali housewife is the wok , locally called the cheen-chetti ( Chinese vessel ) . 
But it has been a while since Indians and Chinese had much to do with each other . 
The heady days of Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai ( &quot; Indians and Chinese are brothers &quot; ) , the slogan coined by Nehru &apos;s India to welcome Chou En-Lai in 1955 , gave way to the humiliation of the 1962 border war , after which it was &quot; Hindi-Chini bye-bye &quot; for decades . 
The border dispute remains unresolved , with periodic incursions by Chinese troops onto Indian soil and new irritants such as the anti-Chinese protests by Tibetan exiles who have been given asylum in India . 
To speak of a bilateral &quot; trust deficit &quot; might be an understatement . 
And yet , there is some good news . 
Trade has doubled in each of the last three years , to an estimated $ 40 billion this year ; 
China has now overtaken the United States as India &apos;s largest single trading partner . 
Tourism , particularly by Indian pilgrims to the major Hindu holy sites in Tibet , Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar , is thriving . 
Indian information technology firms have opened offices in Shanghai and Hangzhou , and Infosys recruited nine Chinese this year for its headquarters in Bangalore . 
There are dozens of Chinese engineers working in ( and learning from ) Indian computer firms and engineering companies , while Indian software engineers support the Chinese telecoms equipment manufacturer Huawei . 
By and large , India is strong in areas in which China needs to improve , notably software , while China excels at hardware and manufacturing , which India sorely lacks . 
So India &apos;s Mahindra and Mahindra company manufactures tractors in Nanchang for export to the US . 
The key operating components of Apple &apos;s iPod were invented by the Hyderabad company PortalPlayer , while the iPod itself are manufactured in China . 
Philips employs nearly 3,000 Indians at its &quot; Innovation Campus &quot; in Bangalore to write more than 20 % of the company &apos;s global software , which Philips &quot; 50,000-strong workforce in China then turns into brand-name goods . 
In other words , the elephant is already dancing with the dragon . 
The only question is whether political tensions could bring the music screeching to a halt . 
There is no doubt that , whatever India &apos;s legitimate differences with China &apos;s Communist regime , cooperation is in the best interests of both peoples . 
After all , one plus one doesn &apos;t only equal two ; put together properly , it can add up to 11 .
