The Price of Biodiversity 
DHAKA - We humans do not only share the planet with a range of other species , including plants , animals , and even microbes ; we also depend on them for our survival . 
Can we determine the economic value of protecting the natural world ? 
Some people will balk at the idea of putting a price tag on biodiversity , viewing its protection as an obvious imperative . 
But they would undoubtedly also agree that preventing human death and suffering , while providing food , water , and an education to all , is vital . 
The reality is that there are simply not enough resources to do everything . 
Hard choices have to be made . 
This is particularly relevant today , as the world &apos;s 193 national governments work to establish the Sustainable Development Goals to guide global development efforts for the next 15 years . 
The SDGs will be modeled on the Millennium Development Goals , which were agreed in 2000 and focused on objectives like lowering maternal and infant mortality , eradicating poverty , and improving access to primary education . 
So far , a huge number of potential SDG targets have been proposed , some of which relate to biodiversity . 
But , though trillions of dollars will be spent on the SDGs , there are simply not enough resources to complete every project . 
My think tank , the Copenhagen Consensus , is working with more than 60 top economists and several Nobel laureates to identify which targets promise the highest return on investment . 
Preserving biodiversity , it turns out , is not only desirable ; according to three new studies by the economists Anil Markandya , Luke Brander , and Alistair McVittie , it also makes good financial sense , at least for some projects . 
Protecting forests is a good place to start , with every dollar spent bringing benefits worth about $ 10 . 
Some of the resources that forests provide - such as timber , firewood , and tourism - can be valuated relatively easily . 
But the value of others - such as the wide range of animal species they support and their intrinsic worth to people - is more difficult to quantify . 
In attempting to do so , economists have conducted surveys to find out how much people would be prepared to pay to protect forests and the animal species they support . 
Forests also serve as an enormous &quot; carbon sink , &quot; storing atmospheric carbon dioxide for many decades or centuries ; thus , protecting forests would help to mitigate climate change . 
Moreover , forests absorb intense rainfall , thereby reducing the risk of flooding . 
The 2010 flooding in Pakistan , for example , would have been far less devastating if so many trees from upper slopes had not been felled . 
The conclusion is thus that each dollar spent on conserving forests would yield $ 5-15 worth of social good , including tangible benefits , such as from logging or carbon capture , and &quot; soft &quot; gains , like preserving forests &apos; intrinsic beauty . 
Conserving the world &apos;s wetlands - which also provide valuable services , including protection of coastal areas and river valleys from flooding - is also sensible , providing a tenfold return on each dollar spent . 
But protecting coral reefs would bring the highest returns , amounting to an extraordinary $ 24 worth of benefits for every dollar spent . 
Like forests , coral reefs provide multiple services - including tourism and fish nurseries , which help to sustain commercial fishing - and have an intrinsic value to people . 
To reduce the loss of coral reefs by half would cost about $ 3 billion each year - and yield at least $ 72 billion in benefits . 
Not all projects aimed at protecting biodiversity are a smart use of public resources . 
Creating additional nature reserves , for example , might sound like a great way to protect more species &apos; natural habitats , but the economic benefits would not cover the nearly $ 1 trillion in costs . 
Doubling the area of protected coastal land and bringing substantial areas of open ocean into reserves is a particularly formidable task . 
Clearly , protecting coral reefs is a much better use of limited resources . 
Though the SDGs will aim largely to improve daily life for the very poor , a cool-headed economic assessment suggests that there are also smart biodiversity targets that should be considered . 
If world leaders take advantage of cost-benefit analysis to separate the wheat from the chaff , the next 15 years could be a boon for global development - including the preservation of biodiversity .
