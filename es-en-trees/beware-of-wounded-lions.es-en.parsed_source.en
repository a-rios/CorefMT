Beware of Wounded Lions 
CAMBRIDGE - G-20 leaders who scoff at the United States &quot; proposal for numerical trade-balance limits should know that they are playing with fire . 
The US is not making a demand as much as it is issuing a plea for help . 
According to a recent joint report by the International Monetary Fund and the International Labor Organization , fully 25 % of the rise in unemployment since 2007 , totaling 30 million people worldwide , has occurred in the US . 
The voter anger expressed in the US mid-term elections could prove to be only the tip of the iceberg . 
Protectionist trade measures , perhaps in the form of a stiff US tariff on Chinese imports , would be profoundly self-destructive , even absent the inevitable retaliatory measures . 
The new US Congress is looking for scapegoats for the country &apos;s economic quagmire . 
If trade frictions do boil over , policymakers may look back on today &apos;s &quot; currency wars &quot; as a minor skirmish in a much larger battle . 
In light of America &apos;s current difficulties , its new proposal for addressing the perennial problem of global imbalances should be seen as a constructive gesture . 
Rather than harping endlessly on China &apos;s currency peg , which is only a small part of the problem , the US has asked for help where it counts : on the bottom line . 
True , today &apos;s trade imbalances are partly a manifestation of broader long-term economic trends , such as Germany &apos;s aging population , China &apos;s weak social safety net , and legitimate concerns in the Middle East over eventual loss of oil revenues . 
And , to be sure , it would very difficult for countries to cap their trade surpluses in practice : there are simply too many macroeconomic and measurement uncertainties . 
Moreover , it is hard to see how anyone - even the IMF , as the US proposal envisions - could enforce caps on trade surpluses . 
The Fund has little leverage over the big countries that are at the heart of the problem . 
Somehow , they must find ways to help the US expand its exports . 
Fortunately , emerging markets have a great deal of scope for action . 
India , Brazil , and China , for example , continue to exploit World Trade Organization rules that allow long phase-in periods for fully opening up their domestic markets to developed-country imports , even as their own exporters enjoy full access to rich-country markets . 
Lackluster enforcement of intellectual property rights exacerbates the problem considerably , hampering US exports of software and entertainment . 
A determined effort by emerging-market countries that have external surpluses to expand imports from the US ( and Europe ) would do far more to address the global trade imbalances over the long run than changes to their exchange rates or fiscal policies . 
Emerging markets have simply become too big and too important to be allowed to play by their own set of trade rules . 
Their leaders must do more to tackle entrenched domestic interests and encourage foreign competition . 
Germany might rightly argue that it has followed a relatively laissez-faire attitude towards trade , and that it should not be punished , despite its chronic surpluses . 
After all , it has stood by as the euro has soared recently . 
Nevertheless , Germany is a huge winner from global free trade , and it is hardly without tools and means to reduce its surpluses - for example , by pressing to de-regulate its highly rigid product markets . 
Given all its recent economic challenges , it is remarkable how , so far , the US has remained steadfast in its support of free trade . 
Even in cases where its rhetoric has sent mixed messages , US policies have been decidedly liberal . 
Consider the long-suffering US-Colombia free-trade negotiations . 
Although one would never know it from listening to the Congressional debate , the main effect of an agreement would be to lower Colombian barriers on US goods , not vice versa . 
Colombian goods already enjoy virtual free entry to the US market , while Colombian consumers would benefit enormously if their country were to reciprocate by opening its markets to US goods and services . 
All should be eliminated . 
American hegemony over the global economy is perhaps in its final decades . 
China , India , Brazil , and other emerging markets are in ascendancy . 
Will the transition will go smoothly and lead to a global economy that is both fairer and more prosperous ? 
However much we may hope so , the current rut in which the US finds itself could prove to be a problem for the rest of the world . 
Unemployment in the US is high , while fiscal and monetary policies have been stretched to their limits . 
Exports are the best way out , but the US needs help . 
Otherwise , simmering trade frictions could suddenly throw globalization sharply into reverse . 
It wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
