The Ethanol Hunger 
WEST LAFAYETTE , INDIANA - Food prices have in many cases surpassed the peak levels reached in July 2008 . 
At that time , food-price increases were attributed to growing global demand for food commodities , a major decline in the value of the US dollar , crop failures in some parts of the world , and biofuels . 
I believe that the key factors now are somewhat different from those that drove up food prices in 2008 . 
Growth in global demand for food and feed commodities is still a major part of the story , as are biofuels . 
As developing countries become better off , one of the first things that happens is so-called &quot; dietary transition . &quot; 
With more income at their disposal , people begin to consume more of their food basket in the form of animal products . 
Producing these animal products requires significantly more agricultural resources than a predominantly plant-based diet . 
So , as incomes grow , demand for food products grows even faster . 
Both population growth and dietary transition contribute to faster demand growth and higher food prices . 
Biofuels policies in the US and the European Union have led to the creation of biofuels industries with significant output capacity - mainly ethanol in the US and biodiesel in the EU . 
In the US , government policy mandates 48 billion liters of ethanol in 2011 . 
Production capacity already exceeds that level . 
Since this quantity is required by the government to be blended with gasoline , regardless of the price of ethanol , corn , or gasoline , the demand that it creates for corn is not at all responsive to the price of corn . 
In economic terms , such demand is highly &quot; inelastic &quot; : the mandate must be met at any price . 
That is the situation in which we now find ourselves , at least in the short run . 
The added inflexibility ( or inelasticity ) amplifies the price response to a real or perceived crop shortfall either in the US or elsewhere . 
In addition , the fact that nearly 40 % of the US corn crop is being used for ethanol , up from around 5 % a few years ago , means that corn prices must be higher to meet the feed , export , and ethanol demands for corn . 
The bottom line is that the current version of US biofuels policy , with its fixed requirement for blending , leads to a greater price response in the event of a crop shortfall - in the short run . 
We saw this in 2008 , and are now seeing it again . 
But the 2011 surge appears to be rooted in broader commodity scarcity than before . 
In the first half of 2008 , commodity prices moved up quickly - and plummeted just as fast in the second half of the year . 
There may well have been speculative behavior that contributed to the rapid swing . 
Even with normal crop production around the world , we will end this year with stocks-to-use ratios near historic lows . 
Stocks-to-use ratios are a primary driver of commodity prices , because they give us an indication of the cushion that we have for shortfalls somewhere in the world . 
The ratio tells us essentially how many months of stocks we have , and today they are around 15 % for some key commodities - meaning two months of stocks . 
What about the long run ? 
With several years to adjust , we would expect a powerful supply-side response to higher commodity prices now prevailing all over the world . 
In many regions around the world , crop yields are only a fraction of US levels - even in agricultural zones with similar climate , soils , and other production conditions . 
In the US , it is common to see a gap of around 20 % between test plots and actual yields in the same area . 
In many other regions , these gaps are 40-60 % . 
The bottom line is that there is huge potential to increase production in many parts of Eastern Europe , Africa , and South America . 
To the extent that higher commodity prices benefit farmers in these regions , they will respond by increasing their production , which will eventually reduce scarcity , increase stocks-to-use ratios , and attenuate the higher prices . 
In fact , to the extent that developing countries permit higher prices to go to their farmers , the result could be a significant stimulus to economic growth in rural regions of developing countries - where most of the world &apos;s poor live . 
One problem is that developing countries often attempt to isolate their domestic markets from world prices , particularly price increases , in order to protect their more politically powerful urban citizens . 
This policy can stymie rural development and diminish poverty alleviation . 
The short- and long-term stories are simplifications , but they nonetheless convey the essence of some critical drivers of price changes . 
America &apos;s biofuels policies inevitably lead to larger price responses to supply shocks in the short run . 
In the long run , the higher prices that result could become an engine of economic development in the world &apos;s poor rural regions . 
That distinction could make a huge difference to millions of people .
