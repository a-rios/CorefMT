Over the Cliff We Go 
BERKELEY - Unless something unexpected happens , the United States &quot; many legislated reductions in taxes over the past 12 years - all of which have been explicitly temporary - will expire simultaneously at the start of 2013 . 
Some of these reductions were implemented to fight what was seen four years ago as a temporary downturn . 
The immediate increase in tax rates is only part of the story . 
At the same time , automatic reductions in the defense budget and &quot; discretionary &quot; domestic spending - agreed to by both Democrats and Republicans in the summer of 2011 - will take effect . 
Couple these tax increases and spending cuts with the provisions of &quot; Obamacare , &quot; the US health-care reform championed by President Barack Obama , and , as of January 1 , 2013 , America &apos;s long-run structural budget deficit disappears . 
The restored tax rates will , for the foreseeable future , be sufficient to support the US defense establishment , the growing US social-insurance system , and a moderate - albeit inadequate and suboptimal - amount of other &quot; discretionary &quot; federal spending . 
The US national debt / GDP ratio will be on track to fall from its current level of 75 % to 50 % by 2035 . 
Moreover , the US will begin running primary budget surpluses - the fiscal balance minus interest payments on existing debt - by 2015 . 
So why isn &apos;t the prospect of going over the fiscal cliff greeted with enthusiasm ? 
Yes , there will be big spending cuts - which will hit defense contractors , doctors with Medicare patients , and all who benefit from or rely on government discretionary spending - and substantial tax increases . 
But , to balance the budget in the long run , either taxes have to go up or spending has to go down relative to some baseline , or both . 
There are two reasons why deficit hawks are not declaring victory . 
But , they fear that calling for spending cuts will be unpopular , unlike , they hope , demands to balance the budget . 
For them , the problem with the fiscal cliff is that it does not cut spending enough and raises taxes too much . Second , and more important for those who worry about the US economy &apos;s health , the process is not well-described by the term &quot; fiscal cliff . &quot; 
It is , rather , an austerity bomb that hits an economy in which unemployment remains high , the employment-to-population ratio remains horrifyingly low , and there are only feeble signs that the large gap between current and potential output is closing . 
The past two months &quot; run-up to the austerity bomb &apos;s detonation has already reduced projected real GDP growth in 2013 from 3 % to 2.5 % , and has raised likely end-2013 unemployment from 7.5 % to 7.7 % . 
Each day from January 1 to June 30 that the damage continues will have a roughly linear impact on economic performance in 2013 , reducing the likely full-year real GDP growth rate by 0.0084 % - and only if a deal is ultimately reached that would have caused no economic harm in 2013 had it been reached on November 10 , 2012 . 
If no deal is reached by June 30 , America &apos;s likely 2013 real GDP growth rate will be -0.5 % , with the likely unemployment rate returning to 8.9 % . 
Spending cuts and tax increases that in the long run restore fiscal sanity and balance are good . 
Having them all hit a weak , still-depressed economy simultaneously is not good . 
Thus , US officials face four tasks . 
First , Republicans and Democrats must negotiate a bipartisan agreement to stretch out the spending cuts and tax increases that take effect on January 1 , 2013 . 
That way , they will affect the economy gradually over five years , rather than all at once . 
Second , the Federal Reserve should expand its quantitative easing and forward guidance programs . 
Consumers will be spending less in 2013 , owing to higher taxes , as will government , which means that someone has to be spending more . 
Housing construction and exports are the obvious candidates , and both can be boosted somewhat by more aggressive balance-sheet operations by the Fed , together with promises of continued low nominal interest rates and higher inflation in the medium term . 
Third , the large government-sponsored mortgage enterprises , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , should be used as macroeconomic-policy tools to restore housing construction to its long-term trend level . 
This should have been done five years ago , but better late than never . 
Finally , and also five years too late , the US Treasury secretary should announce that while the strong-dollar doctrine was appropriate ( and in America &apos;s interest ) during the dot-com boom , the country needs a weak dollar in the aftermath of the austerity bomb &apos;s detonation . 
Reaching the wrong agreement to defuse the austerity bomb , or cushion the economy from its impact , would merely recreate America &apos;s long-run structural budget deficit - a very bad outcome . 
Failure to take all four steps outlined above all but guarantees renewed recession in America , even if a good agreement is reached on stretching out the tax hikes and spending cuts .
