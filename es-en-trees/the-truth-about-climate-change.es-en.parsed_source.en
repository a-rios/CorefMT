The Truth About Climate Change 
EXETER - Many people ask how sure we are about the science of climate change . 
The most definitive examination of the scientific evidence is to be found in the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and its last major report published in 2007 . 
I had the privilege of being chairman or co-chairman of the Panel &apos;s scientific assessments from 1988 to 2002 . 
Many hundreds of scientists from different countries were involved as contributors and reviewers for these reports , which are probably the most comprehensive and thorough international assessments on any scientific subject ever carried out . 
In June 1995 , just before the G-8 summit in Scotland , the Academies of Science of the world &apos;s 11 largest economies ( the G-8 plus India , China , and Brazil ) issued a statement endorsing the IPCC &apos;s conclusions and urging world governments to take urgent action to address climate change . 
The world &apos;s top scientists could not have spoken more strongly . 
Unfortunately , strong vested interests have spent millions of dollars on spreading misinformation about climate change . 
First , they tried to deny the existence of any scientific evidence for global warming . 
More recently , they have largely accepted the fact of anthropogenic ( man-made ) climate change but argue that its impacts will not be great , that we can &quot; wait and see , &quot; and that in any case we can always fix the problem if it turns out to be substantial . 
The scientific evidence does not support such arguments . 
Urgent action is needed both to adapt to the climate change that is inevitable and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , especially CO2 , to prevent further damage as far as possible . 
At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , the world &apos;s nations signed up to the Framework Convention on Climate Change ( FCCC ) , the objective of which is &quot; to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level that does not cause dangerous interference with the climate system ... , that allows ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change , that ensures food production is not threatened , and that enables economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner . &quot; 
Such stabilization would also eventually stop further climate change . 
It is now recognized that widespread damage due , for instance , to sea level rise and more frequent and intense heat waves , floods and droughts , will occur even for small increases of global average temperature . 
Therefore it is necessary that very strong efforts be made to hold the average global temperature rise below 2ยบ Celsius relative to its preindustrial level . 
If we are to have a good chance of achieving that target , the concentration of CO2 must not be allowed to exceed 450 parts per million ( it is now nearly 390 ppm ) . 
This implies that before 2050 global emissions of CO2 must be reduced to below 50 % of the 1990 level ( they are currently 15 % above that level ) , and that average emissions in developed countries must be reduced by at least 80 % of the 1990 level . 
The United Kingdom has already committed itself to a binding target to reduce emissions by that amount , and President Barack Obama has expressed intention that the United States should also set that target . 
One clear requirement is that tropical deforestation , which is responsible for 20 % of greenhouse gas emissions , be halted within the next decade or two . 
Regarding emissions from the burning of fossil fuels , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) in its &quot; Energy Technology Perspectives &quot; has set out in detail the technologies and actions that are needed in different countries and sectors to meet these targets . 
For the short term , the IEA points out that very strong and determined action will be necessary to ensure that global CO2 emissions stop rising ( the current increase is more than 3 % per year ) , reach a peak by about 2015 , and then decline steadily toward the 2050 target . 
The IEA also points out that the targets can be achieved without unacceptable economic damage . 
In fact , the IEA lists many benefits that will be realized if its recommendations are followed . 
What is required now is recognition that anthropogenic climate change will severely affect our children , grandchildren , the world &apos;s ecosystems , and the world &apos;s poorer communities , and that the severity of the impact can be substantially alleviated by taking action now .
