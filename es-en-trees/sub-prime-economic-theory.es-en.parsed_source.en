Sub-Prime Economic Theory 
The insistence that those responsible for today &apos;s financial crisis pay a price lest they repeat their mistakes - the so called moral hazard argument - recalls the great American orator William Jennings Bryan &apos;s immortal &quot; cross of gold &quot; speech : &quot; You shall not press down upon the brow of labor a crown of thorns . 
You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold . &quot; 
In other words , ordinary people should not be made to suffer for the foibles of policymakers enthralled by some defunct economic theory . Today , the defunct economic theory is that a rapid shift in preferences - colorfully called a &quot; reduced appetite for risk &quot; - is the key reason behind the current sub-prime mortgage and financial crisis . 
To avoid future increases in this appetite , policymakers and pundits have focused on the so-called &quot; moral hazard problem &quot; : the &quot; bad guys &quot; must pay for their mistakes , lest they make them again . 
One would have expected the modern-day William Jennings Bryan to be warning central bankers not to crucify mankind on a &quot; cross of moral hazard and no-bailouts . &quot; 
But , surprisingly , the opposite is occurring . 
Some on the left , motivated in part by revulsion against financial types who are thought to reap unjustified incomes , have joined forces with conventional economists , whose almost religious belief in their models has blinded them to the harm their dubious economic theory can do to the real economy and the interests of ordinary people . 
No bailouts can mean no college for the kids - or , for many , no house . 
The key question economists should now be asking is why financial markets are &quot; seizing up &quot; when banks and other financial institutions are flush with liquidity . 
The conventional explanation - a reduced appetite for risk - is not convincing . 
The sub-prime market seems too small to have caused such a broad-based change in risk preference . 
A more convincing explanation is that the current crisis , with its unknown dimensions and scope , has so clouded the economic landscape as to freeze market participants in their tracks , so to speak , until things clear up . 
That is the fundamental lesson of an important new book , Imperfect Knowledge Economics : Exchange Rates and Risk , by Roman Frydman and Michael Goldberg . 
The key to understanding financial markets , especially when they are as unsettled as they have been in recent weeks , is not a change in preferences , but inherent imperfection of knowledge and altered expectations concerning the future course of macroeconomic fundamentals . 
What policy prescriptions does the &quot; imperfect knowledge &quot; approach imply for the current crisis ? 
The most important one for central bankers is that they should cut interest rates - and cut them fast - to re-assure market participants that turmoil in financial markets will not be allowed to affect the real economy . 
Judging by its recent policy reversal , the US Federal Reserve acts as if it were a late convert to the imperfect knowledge hypothesis . 
Led by Ben Bernanke , a former leading academic economist , the Fed at first fell into the trap of turning a blind eye to the wider consequences of the sub-prime mortgage crisis . 
It injected money into the system , but ruled out interest-rate cuts . 
The results of this misguided policy proved so disastrous - financial markets seized up almost immediately - that a mere ten days after its &quot; What , me worry ? &quot; message , the Fed made an embarrassing but necessary about-face and lowered the discount rate by 50 basis points . 
Downward risks to growth had significantly increased , Fed officials explained . 
It matters little that the Fed could have gone further and cut the federal funds rate as well as the discount rate at its emergency meeting - indeed , that may have to be done . 
The important thing is that the Fed &apos;s policy crossed the bridge from indifference to re-assurance . 
Could it be that Bernanke obtained an advanced copy of the Frydman-Goldberg book during those pregnant ten days in August ? 
Bernanke , after an initial stumble - a rookie mistake as one commentator put it - appears to be following in his predecessor Alan Greenspan &apos;s footsteps . 
But what of Jean-Claude Trichet , president of the European Central Bank ? 
The ECB had indicated in August that it would raise rates in September but backed down when the financial crisis continued unabated . 
Good for it . 
By in effect cutting rates from their expected levels , the ECB joined the US Federal Reserve in moving from a policy of indifference to one of reassurance . 
This should help stabilize financial markets . 
The ECB and Fed now seem to be moving in tandem to limit the effects of the crisis on the real economy . 
Realism has thankfully trumped theory .
