Could the IMF Have Prevented This Crisis ? 
WASHINGTON D.C.  -  
Today , however , emerging countries increasingly prefer to &quot; self-insure &quot; by accumulating reserves ( and sharing them through regional pooling arrangements ) . 
As a result , the Fund must change , reinforcing its supervisory role and its capacity to oversee members &quot; compliance with their obligation to contribute to financial stability . 
So its failure to press the United States to redress the mortgage-market vulnerabilities that precipitated the current financial crisis indicates that much remains to be done . 
Indeed , in its 2006 annual review of the US economy , the IMF was extraordinarily benign in its assessment of the risks posed by the relaxation of lending standards in the US mortgage market . 
It noted that &quot; borrowers at risk of significant mortgage payment increases remained a small minority , concentrated mostly among higher-income households that were aware of the attendant risks , &quot; and concluded that &quot; indications are that credit and risk allocation mechanisms in the U.S. housing market have remained relatively efficient . &quot; 
This , it added , &quot; should provide comfort . &quot; 
Likewise , the problem was not mentioned in one of the IMF &apos;s flagship publications , the Global Financial Stability Report ( GFSR ) , in September 2006 , just ten months before the sub-prime mortgage crisis became apparent to all . 
In the IMF &apos;s view , &quot; &#91; m &#93; ajor financial institutions in mature ... markets &#91; were &#93; ... healthy , having remained profitable and well capitalized , &quot; and &quot; the financial sectors in many countries are in a strong position to cope with any cyclical challenges and further market corrections to come . &quot; 
The IMF began to take notice only in April 2007 , when the problem was already erupting , but there was still no sense of urgency . 
On the contrary , according to the IMF , &quot; weakness has been contained to certain portions of the sub-prime market ( and , to a lesser extent , the Alt-A market ) , and is not likely to pose a serious systemic threat . &quot; 
Moreover , &quot; the US housing market appears to be stabilizing .... Overall , the US mortgage market has remained resilient , although the sub-prime segment has deteriorated a bit more rapidly than had been expected . &quot; 
The GFSR confidently noted that &quot; stress tests conducted by investment banks show that , even under scenarios of nationwide house price declines that are historically unprecedented , most investors with exposure to subprime mortgages through securitized structures will not face losses . &quot; 
Why has the Fund &apos;s surveillance of the US economy been so ineffective ? 
Suppose that the vulnerabilities piling up in the US mortgage market - right under the IMF &apos;s Washington-headquartered nose - had taken place in a developing country . 
It is , frankly , inconceivable that the Fund would have failed so miserably in detecting them . 
The IMF has been criticized for burdening borrowers with unnecessary and sometimes perverse lending conditions , but its highly qualified staff has not been shy in blowing the whistle when it perceived domestic vulnerabilities in other countries . 
So why didn &apos;t they scrutinize the US economy with equal zeal ? 
The answer may be found in the IMF &apos;s governance structure . 
Currently , the distribution of power within the IMF follows the logic of its lending role . 
The more money a country puts in , the more influence it has . 
This may be prompting the Fund to turn a blind eye to the economic vulnerabilities of its most influential members - precisely those whose domestic policies have large , systemic implications . 
This &quot; money-for-influence &quot; model of governance indirectly impairs the IMF &apos;s capacity to criticize the economies of its most important members ( let alone police compliance with their obligations ) . 
In any event , if its staff &apos;s criticism ever becomes too candid , these countries can always use their leverage to water down the public communiqu√©s issued by the IMF &apos;s board . 
The Fund can help to prevent future crisis of this kind , but only if it first prevents undue influence on its capacity to scrutinize , and if necessary criticize , influential countries &quot; policies and regulations . 
This requires a different governance structure in which power is more evenly distributed , so that the IMF can effectively exercise surveillance where it should , not just where it can .
