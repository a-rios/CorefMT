The Trauma of France &apos;s Jews 
PARIS - &quot; Death to the Jews ! &quot; 
In Paris and other French cities , the hate-filled words ring out . 
Attacks on synagogues have taken place for the first time since the Dreyfus Affair at the end of the nineteenth century . 
In suburban areas near Paris , such as the town of Sarcelles , known for its climate of religious and ethnic tolerance , groups of young people have deliberately targeted Jewish properties . 
Faced with the spectacular rise of anti-immigrant populism in France , and now with anti-Zionist demonstrations ( which often coincide with an updated version of anti-Semitism ) , the French Jewish community is anguished and puzzled . 
Some of its members are quietly asking themselves whether there is a future for them in the land of human rights . 
French Jews are rediscovering the dual trauma that they experienced during the twentieth century : the death-camp deportations of World War II and their flight from Algeria following its independence in 1962 . 
It is to be expected that these episodes color - and tend to exacerbate - the emotions of the present . 
French descendants of Eastern European Jews have not yet fully come to terms with a continent - including Vichy France - that they still associate with the Holocaust , whereas Jews from the Maghreb tend to resent the fact that even in France , they remain surrounded by &quot; Arabs . &quot; 
Indeed , a significant portion of the Jewish community in the south of France votes for the far-right National Front , which , under the leadership of Marine Le Pen , has concentrated its xenophobia on Muslims . 
In this tense setting , it comes as no surprise that the question of whether anti-Semitism has returned to France , after a seven-decade hiatus , is making international headlines . 
British and American media reports have made comparisons to the Nazi era , with some even referring , in the aftermath of attacks on French synagogues , to a French Kristallnacht . 
Such hyperbole must be firmly rejected , for it offends the memory of those who suffered as a result of Vichy France &apos;s collaboration with Nazi Germany . 
After the Gestapo arrested my father in Nice in 1943 , he was escorted by French gendarmes to the transit camp at Drancy , in the Paris suburbs , before being deported to Auschwitz . 
In 2014 , by contrast , the French state defends the synagogues and denounces any form of anti-Semitism . 
But even if the French state is not anti-Semitic , anti-Semitism does exist in France - and probably more so recently than in the postwar period . 
And the worsening situation in the Middle East has , of course , played a key role in this , particularly the shocking images from Gaza . 
The asymmetrical war being waged there by Israel seems disproportionate to a majority of world opinion , not just Arabs and Muslims . 
To be sure , no state can passively accept rocket attacks on its cities . 
But the strategy of terror used by the Israeli authorities to deter further attacks or to restore a temporary &quot; quiet &quot; has been costly not only in terms of Palestinian lives lost and Israeli soldiers killed ; it has also contributed to the deterioration of the security of Jews around the world . 
In France , too , many of them express - often quietly - both their deep love for what Israel is and their deep concern for what Israel is now doing . 
It is one thing to say that the Middle East conflict should not be exported to France . 
If the images from Gaza seem to resonate so much in France , it is partly a matter of sheer numbers : the largest Muslim community in Europe faces the largest Jewish community in Europe . 
But it is not only a question of numbers . 
The young thugs who have attacked synagogues come mostly from the ranks of the unemployed and frustrated . 
They vent their rage at a system that does not integrate them . 
They even resent the Republic &apos;s commemoration of Jews &quot; suffering during WWII . 
For them , past horror is abstract ; only the present horror can be felt . 
The encounter between the images of today &apos;s Middle East and the discontent of Muslim minorities ( sometimes influenced by radical fundamentalist ideologies ) should not be allowed to obscure traditional French anti-Semitism , white and bourgeois , which still lingers and is never far beneath the surface . 
But the French state does what it has to do to repress and contain anti-Semitism . 
Comparisons to Nazi-era Europe do nothing to reassure a community that , despite all of the major historical differences between then and now , cannot quite shake the feeling that it is dancing on the rim of a volcano .
