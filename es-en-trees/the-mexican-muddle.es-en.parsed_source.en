The Mexican Muddle 
MEXICO CITY - This month , Mexico &apos;s Felipe Calderón celebrates his second anniversary as president . 
Calderón took office in December 2006 under adverse circumstances . 
Elected with 35 % of the vote , he lacked a majority in Congress , and the opposition refused to acknowledge his victory . 
He has also had to govern in a persistently difficult environment : a lame-duck president next door in the United States , a severe economic downturn , and the legacy of corruption , negligence , and complicity handed down by his predecessors since 1968 , when Mexico &apos;s old one-party political system began to crumble . 
Most immediately , Calderón had to address his immediate predecessor &apos;s failure to implement any of the major reforms that Mexico needed . 
Vicente Fox took office in 2000 with a broad mandate , but , like Calderón , without a majority in Congress . 
He proved unable to forge lasting legislative coalitions , leading Calderón to decide that his first break with the past should consist in building alliances to enact reform . 
Soon , however , this became an end in itself , and Calderón proved adept at constructing short-lived coalitions for largely inconsequential reforms . 
This watered-down gradualism has become his trademark . 
Given this , it is no surprise that the list of question marks attached to Calderón &apos;s administration is longer than that of his achievements . 
His poll numbers reflect this ambivalence . 
He remains personally popular and well regarded , but the public is increasingly dissatisfied and disappointed with his government &apos;s actual performance . 
Among his few successes are state-employee pension fund reforms , which will save the system from bankruptcy . 
Another lies in having weakened and neutralized the left-wing opposition , and being able to govern without major confrontations in the streets or Congress . 
Other changes - a counter-productive electoral reform , a minor revenue-enhancing tax reform , and hypothetical oil-sector reform - all suffer from Calderón &apos;s penchant for minimalism : enacting legislation seems more important to him than the content . 
Indeed , Mexico &apos;s monopoly structures and immense concentration of power remain untouched - as they were under Calderón &apos;s only two democratic predecessors , Ernesto Zedillo and Fox . 
Public monopolies like Pemex , private monopolies like Telmex and Cemex , labor monopolies like the teachers &quot; union , media monopolies like Televisa , and the iron political lock the country &apos;s three parties have on every level of electoral representation , are all stronger than before . 
Calderón has refused to touch these power structures , even though everyone , from the World Bank to left-wing rabble-rouser and former presidential candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador , agree that they are the main impediments to Mexico &apos;s progress . 
Because of this enduring status quo , Mexico &apos;s people do not blame Calderón for today &apos;s harsh economic downturn ; it is business as usual , they think . 
But public opinion is becoming more skeptical about the wisdom of the president &apos;s signature policy : using the armed forces to launch an all-out drive against drug dealers . 
Ultimately , this is what he will be judged by . 
Mexico &apos;s government and military had established a tacit , semi-violent , corrupt , but effective modus vivendi with the drug cartels since the early 1970 &quot; s . 
Mexico was then a producer of heroin and marijuana , and a transit country for cocaine from South America . 
Calderón decided , in late 2006 , that accommodation was no longer tolerable : the violence had gotten out of control ; the corruption and complicity had infected the nation &apos;s police and political elite ; and Mexico had become a major producer of methamphetamines for the US , as well as a significant consumer of cocaine . 
Thus , his declaration of war . 
But the new president kicked over the narcotics beehive with neither a fumigator nor protective netting on hand . 
The bees have overwhelmed him , and violence , corruption , complicity , and contamination of the state have all skyrocketed . 
The reasons for Calderón &apos;s rejection of the former arrangements now appear less self-evident than before . 
It is unclear that drug use in Mexico is extending more widely into the population : alarming rates of addiction growth are misleading , because addiction starts from an extremely low base . 
Calderón had tried to sell his &quot; war on drugs &quot; by insisting that he is waging it to &quot; save our children . &quot; 
If that connection proves faulty , it will not work , and Mexicans may question the point of a &quot; war &quot; that has more than doubled the number of gangland executions , from 2,000 in 2006 to 5,000 in 2008 , when their children , statistically at least , are not in harm &apos;s way . 
Moreover , the capacity of Mexico &apos;s security machinery appears diminished . 
The police are at best useless and at worst outright employees of the drug lords ; the army is less tainted , but unprepared for the role . 
It will take years and billions of dollars to change this state of affairs ; 
Calderón does not have the time , and only the US has the money . 
But Calderón doesn &apos;t want American aid on American terms . 
He rejects the Colombian model , which would put American advisers , instructors , mechanics , agents , and maintenance personnel on the ground in Mexico . 
He may be right , but the alternative is no military makeover , and no likelihood of winning a war that perhaps should not have been declared in the first place . 
Had it not been for the world economic crisis , or if it ends up being short and shallow , many observers , including me , remain convinced that Mexico can continue to muddle through , as it has done since 1996 . 
These past 13 years have been fair-to-middling for the country : mediocre economic growth , but no collapse ; democratic rotation in power , with no uprisings or massacres ; a slow but steady expansion of the middle class ; and a slow but steady drop in corruption . 
Given 15 to 20 more years of this unsatisfactory progress , Mexico will become a lower-middle class country like Portugal , Greece , or Poland . 
But we realistic optimists are no longer holding our breath : we may be disappointed , once again .
