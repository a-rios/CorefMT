Is the Market Moral ? 
Clemenceau once said that war is too important to be left to the generals . 
By the same token , morality is too important to be left to philosophers , especially where the morality of markets is concerned . 
Those who see themselves as the protectors of morality are more likely to be antipathetic to markets , whereas those who favor them typically talk about production , distribution , and material wealth - anything but morality . 
The market &apos;s positive moral features , however , are many . 
Consider one identified by Adam Smith , namely the link between individual autonomy and self-support through legally free labor . 
&quot; It is not from the benevolence of the butcher , the brewer , or the baker that we expect our dinner , but from their regard to their own interest , &quot; Smith wrote . 
&quot; Nobody but a beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow citizens . &quot; 
This passage is a famous statement of the utility of self-interest . 
But notice its assertion that dependence on others is morally degrading . 
Thomas Carlyle , and later Marx and Engels , would decry this appeal to self-interest and the related rise of the &quot; cash nexus &quot; as either a dangerous assault on tradition or a source of human self-alienation . 
At the least , there is the danger that the cash nexus can encourage a mindless commitment to work , and the belief that one &apos;s worth comes only from paid labor , leading to fear of dependence on others , or to shunning vital but unpaid activity . 
But the flip side of the cash nexus is the freedom and self-determination that comes from overturning customary social relations such as slavery and serfdom , which totally subordinated the individual to the will of a master . 
This independence was at the core of Hegel &apos;s insistence that supporting oneself by earning a living is one of the key ways that we gain a sense of ourselves as individuals . 
Moreover , market relations stimulate honesty as a virtue . 
Merchants who seek to build their business on a strong base of regular customers are unlikely to engage in fraud . 
Companies that want to attract and retain investors strive for financial transparency . 
Perhaps most importantly , market relations contribute to international peace by creating ever-wider forms of association . 
As Smith emphasized , when commerce links us to foreign peoples , we come to regard them not as barbarians but as potential suppliers and customers . 
In other words , capitalism creates a rational awareness of their needs and interests . 
Similarly , markets are a powerful solvent of religious and communal antagonism , by creating incentives to cooperate with those whose identity and ultimate commitments differ from our own . 
Having just passed through the bloodiest century in human history , increasing the zone of indifference to the ultimate goals of others - as long as they are not directed against us - should be mankind &apos;s top priority . 
But self-interested indifference does not mean a lack of mutual concern . 
Self-interest is linked to mutual concern every time a sales clerk asks , &quot; Can I help you ? &quot; 
That phrase is often derided as phony and manipulative - except by those who have lived in societies where sales clerks ignore customers . 
The sales clerk &apos;s commercially motivated solicitude does lack true charity and altruism . 
But , seen historically , the market &apos;s ability to create a self-interested regard for others is surely preferable to the alternatives . 
Of course , self-interested solicitude can lead to inauthenticity , to a sense of always selling oneself - or rather , a sense of having to become someone who can be sold . 
This is a consistent theme of modern social criticism , from Rousseau through &quot; Death of a Salesman &quot; and beyond . 
The constant creation of new needs - when not bounded by a sense of how novelty fits into our lives - may put us on a treadmill of joyless consumption . 
But capitalism also creates newer and more complex forms of individuality than before . 
In previous societies , one &apos;s status as a peasant , artisan , or merchant often defined one totally . 
Being a member of a guild , for example , encompassed a complete set of social roles - economic , legal , political , and even religious . 
Modern market society , by contrast , is based upon looser , more temporary associations , founded to pursue specific economic , cultural , or political interests . 
Such associations demand only a small part of the individual &apos;s resources , sometimes only a token monetary contribution . 
As a result , the modern individual can belong to a greater range of groups , but groups that are less all encompassing . 
Modern associations allow for participation without absorption . 
I am a husband and father , a Buddhist , a jazz aficionado , a molecular biologist , a marksman , and a reader of modernist fiction . 
What is historically new - emerging just in the last few hundred years - is the possibility of being all of these things at once . 
This choice of possibilities is due in no small part to the market , and the peril we face is that so much choice can create a protean self , lacking binding commitments to anyone or anything , a self for whom the bottom line of every social contract is the escape clause . 
But awareness of this danger should not lead us to lose sight of a fundamental fact : many of the moral advantages and conceptions of selfhood that those in capitalist societies take for granted are due in no small part to capitalism itself .
