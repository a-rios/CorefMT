Separate but Equal Revisited by Ralf Dahrendorf 
Surely not a wall ? 
An Israeli friend , a &quot; Peace Now &quot; activist , replied to my question with his own : &quot; Do you realise that not one suicide bomber entered Israel from the Gaza Strip ? &quot; 
Why not ? 
&quot; Because there is a fence . &quot; 
If an electric fence was built around the West Bank territory , he continued , two problems could be solved at once . 
Things , of course , are not that simple . 
Such a fence would probably include settlements close to , but inside the 1967 line . 
The return of the settlers would be a difficult process both in practical terms and because of Israeli public opinion . 
Then there are the questions of the Israeli Arabs and of Jerusalem ( for is it , as Berlin once was , to be sliced in two by a wall ? ) . 
Having said that , it is striking that a man of liberal values such as my &quot; Peace Now &quot; friend should advocate the physical separation of groups as the road - perhaps the only road - to peace.Things , of course , are not that simple .

The notion that groups should have equal rights but remain separate was once the ultimate concession of traditionalists in the old segregated American South . 
A form of apartheid without oppression was as far as they were prepared to go .

A form of apartheid without oppression was as far as they were prepared to go . 
Liberal forces , however , pushed for a different solution . They wanted a society in which races and ethnic groups and religious denominations mixed freely . When they lived apart in their own &quot; ghettos , &quot; their children were taken by bus to schools of the other groups so that what is nowadays called multi-culturalism could be practised . Ultimately , the liberal dream saw a blurring of lines of difference not only by common living spaces but also by intermarriage . It is , no doubt , the ultimate dream of a fully developed citizenship that a common floor of rights  -  including a guaranteed economic status - will enable different people to live together in harmony . 
But today we know that this is only a dream . 
It may merely appear to become real where people of different social classes live together , but this is so because the lines of class themselves have become blurred . 
It does not make a lot of difference whether my neighbour makes , sells , repairs or uses computers . 
However , where differences cannot easily be blurred - those of religion , ethnic and cultural origin , colour - common citizenship has not achieved the unity of diversity so many have dreamed about . 
In fact wherever different groups have had to share a space , they have either fought each other or drawn a line to stay separate . 
Sometimes these lines are highly visible . 
They are in fact borders , as they are drawn most dramatically between the parts of what used to be Yugoslavia . 
Usually the drama imposed a high human cost . 
&quot; Ethnic cleansing &quot; meant in most cases persecution and killing . 
Where international peacekeepers stepped in they soon abandoned all hope of making Muslims and Christians , Croats and Serbs live as neighbours again even among those who had been peaceful neighbours in the past . 
Elsewhere , even in the most civilised countries , the same process may not be as visible but is equally prevalent . 
The Turks of Berlin , the Bangladeshis of Bradford , the North Africans of the suburbs of Paris have not blended into the surrounding societies . 
In fact , sometimes the second generation cultivates its difference from the mainstream culture more aggressively than the original immigrants . 
Why ? 
Why do equal citizenship rights not achieve their purpose ? 
In many cases , people may not have tried hard enough . 
After all , so far as Jews are concerned , Israel has done a remarkable job of integrating diversity . 
The United States may be less of a melting pot today than it was a century ago , but even so it sets a good example . 
Perhaps it is the lack of integrative strength in other societies which makes people feel that the only place where they really belong is among their own people . 
Globalisation may have something to do with it , as well as the disintegration that accompanies modernity . 
For those who have not abandoned hope for the eventual victory of enlightened values but who nonetheless see things as they are in the real world , a version of &quot; separate but equal &quot; may provide at least an interim answer . 
So far as equality is concerned , the guarantee of full citizenship rights for all represents a major task . 
Much remains to be done to achieve it . 
So far as separateness is concerned , it should not be explicitly promoted unless a fence seems to be the only hope of peace . 
It should , however , be allowed , while at the same time common spaces should be both available and safe for all . 
London comes to mind when thinking of an example of relative success in the face of extraordinary diversity . 
In this great metropolis , many people live among mostly their own but share the pleasures as well as the miseries of public spaces . 
Their lives are intertwined and yet diverse .
