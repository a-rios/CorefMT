Magna Carta at 800 
PRINCETON - Fly out of London &apos;s Heathrow Airport and you may pass over a grassy field called Runnymede . 
Eight hundred years ago this month , it offered a colorful spectacle , dotted with the tents of barons and knights , and the larger pavilion of King John of England , looking like a circus top with the royal standard fluttering above . 
Despite the gathering &apos;s pageant-like appearance , the atmosphere was undoubtedly tense . 
The purpose was to settle a conflict between rebellious barons and their king , a ruler described by a contemporary as &quot; brimful of evil qualities . &quot; 
John &apos;s efforts to raise money to regain lost lands in France exceeded the usual taxes and levies that the nobles had accepted from his predecessors . 
The king seized the estates , and sometimes the person , of wealthy lords or merchants and demanded hefty payments for their release . 
If his years of amassing cash had led to victory , John might have got away with his arbitrary methods ; but when he was defeated in France , a group of barons rose up against him and captured London . 
As part of a peace deal brokered by the Archbishop of Canterbury , the king accepted the baron &apos;s demands , put to him in a document called Magna Carta , or &quot; the Great Charter . &quot; 
Magna Carta was not the first charter to be granted by an English king . 
A century earlier , Henry I , by issuing a Coronation Charter , had indicated that he would be more respectful of the nobles &quot; privileges than was his predecessor . 
But Henry &apos;s successors soon returned to the arbitrary ways of kings in those times . 
Magna Carta , too , looked like it might be short-lived . 
It was soon annulled by Pope Innocent III , who had formed an alliance with the king . 
But John died the following year , and the nobles backing his successor , the nine-year-old Henry III , needed support against a rival claimant to the throne . 
To gain that support , Henry &apos;s government reissued its own version of Magna Carta , which remains part of the laws of England . 
Copies were made and dispersed to many of the great English cathedrals . 
The Latin original was translated first into French , the language of the nobility , and then into English . 
By the end of the century , peasants were citing it in a struggle against injustice . 
The first printed edition was made in 1508 . 
In the 1640s , parliamentarians saw in it a legal basis for their overthrow of King Charles I. Later rebels , including the American revolutionaries and Nelson Mandela , have similarly justified their actions by appealing to Magna Carta . 
What these fighters for justice and freedom take from this 3,500-word document is the brief statements of general principles in response to John &apos;s arbitrary seizure of his subjects &quot; property and person . 
In its 39th Chapter , Magna Carta states : &quot; No free man is to be arrested , or imprisoned , or diseised &#91; dispossessed &#93; , or outlawed , or exiled , or in any way destroyed , nor will we go against him , nor will we send against him , save by the lawful judgement of his peers or by the law of the land . &quot; 
Chapter 40 states , concisely , another powerful principle : &quot; To no one will we sell , to no one will we deny or delay , right or justice . &quot; 
These two chapters have their modern echo in the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution , which decrees that no state shall deprive anyone of life , liberty , or property &quot; without due process of law &quot; or deny anyone &quot; the equal protection of the laws . &quot; 
Yet Magna Carta is not a democratic document . 
Although it established the requirement of common consent to taxation , that consent was to be obtained from an assembly of earls , barons , bishops , and abbots - in the age of chivalry , not even knights were invited to participate . 
The idea that towns such as London should be represented was voiced at the time , but it found no place in the final text . 
What Magna Carta shows , therefore , is that &quot; Who rules ? &quot; is one question , and &quot; What , if any , are the limits to political power ? &quot; is another . 
Because Magna Carta attempted to set limits to political power without grounding these limits in the sovereignty of the people , it demonstrated a problem with which philosophers have grappled for even longer than 800 years . 
From where do the principles that constrain rulers come , if from neither the rulers nor their subjects ? 
The tradition of natural law offers an answer that was familiar to medieval scholars , for whom natural law was knowable to us by our natural reason ( as opposed to those laws that could be discovered only through divine revelation ) . 
Magna Carta &apos;s key principles can be seen as derived from reason because the very idea of a law excludes arbitrary arrest and seizure , as well as the rendering of a verdict on any grounds other than the proper application of the law . 
If A is legally bound to return B &apos;s cow when she strays onto his land , and then C &apos;s cow strays onto B &apos;s land in relevantly similar circumstances , B must also be bound to return C &apos;s cow . 
C need not bribe the judge to get his cow back . 
There is nothing in Magna Carta that prevents the enactment and enforcement of unjust laws ; but it does elevate the law above the ruler &apos;s will . 
Unfortunately , that idea still is not accepted in many countries . 
Moreover , as the continued existence of the US prison camp at Guant√°namo Bay shows , even among countries that trace their political institutions to Magna Carta , perceived security threats have weakened the requirement that no one be arrested except under the law of the land , and that justice not be delayed .
