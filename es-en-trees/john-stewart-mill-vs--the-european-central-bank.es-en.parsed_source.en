John Stewart Mill vs. the European Central Bank 
BERKELEY - One of the dirty secrets of economics is that there is no such thing as &quot; economic theory . &quot; 
There is simply no set of bedrock principles on which one can base calculations that illuminate real-world economic outcomes . 
We should bear in mind this constraint on economic knowledge as the global drive for fiscal austerity shifts into top gear . 
Unlike economists , biologists , for example , know that every cell functions according to instructions for protein synthesis encoded in its DNA . 
Chemists begin with what the Heisenberg and Pauli principles , plus the three-dimensionality of space , tell us about stable electron configurations . 
Physicists start with the four fundamental forces of nature . 
Economists have none of that . 
The &quot; economic principles &quot; underpinning their theories are a fraud - not fundamental truths but mere knobs that are twiddled and tuned so that the &quot; right &quot; conclusions come out of the analysis . 
The &quot; right &quot; conclusions depend on which of two types of economist you are . 
One type chooses , for non-economic and non-scientific reasons , a political stance and a set of political allies , and twiddles and tunes his or her assumptions until they yield conclusions that fit their stance and please their allies . 
The other type takes the carcass of history , throws it into the pot , turns up the heat , and boils it down , hoping that the bones will yield lessons and suggest principles to guide our civilization &apos;s voters , bureaucrats , and politicians as they slouch toward utopia . 
Not surprisingly , I believe that only the second kind of economist has anything useful to say . 
So what lessons does history have to teach us about our current global economic predicament ? 
In 1829 , John Stuart Mill made the key intellectual leap in figuring out how to fight what he called &quot; general gluts . &quot; 
Mill saw that excess demand for some particular set of assets in financial markets was mirrored by excess supply of goods and services in product markets , which in turn generated excess supply of workers in labor markets . 
The implication of this was clear . 
If you relieved the excess demand for financial assets , you also cured the excess supply of goods and services ( the shortfall of aggregate demand ) and the excess supply of labor ( mass unemployment ) . 
Now , there are many ways to relieve excess demand for financial assets . 
When the excess demand is for liquid assets used as means of payment - for &quot; money &quot; - the natural response is to have the central bank buy government bonds for cash , thus increasing the money stock and bringing supply back into balance with demand . 
We call this &quot; monetary policy . &quot; 
When the excess demand is for longer-term assets - bonds to serve as vehicles for savings that move purchasing power from the present into the future - the natural response is twofold : induce businesses to borrow more and build more capacity , and encourage the government to borrow and spend , thus bringing the supply of bonds back into balance with demand . 
We call the first of these &quot; restoring confidence , &quot; and the second &quot; fiscal policy . &quot; 
When excess demand is for high-quality assets - places where you can park your wealth and be assured that it will still be there when you come back - the natural response is to have credit-worthy governments guarantee some private assets and buy up others , swapping them out for their own liabilities and thus diminishing the supply of risky assets and increasing the supply of safe assets . 
We call this &quot; banking policy . &quot; 
Of course , no real-world policy falls cleanly into any one of these ideal types . 
Right now , the European Central Bank worries that continued expansionary fiscal policy will backfire . 
Yes , it argues , having governments spend more money and continue to run large deficits will increase the supply of bonds , and thus relieve excess demand for longer-term assets . 
It will have relieved a shortage of longer-term assets by creating a shortage of high-quality assets , and so be in a worse position than it was before . 
The ECB contends that the core economies of the global North - Germany , France , Britain , the United States , and Japan - are now at the point where they need rapid fiscal retrenchment and austerity , because financial markets &quot; confidence in the quality of their debt is shaken , and may collapse at any moment . 
And policymakers are falling into line : in late July , Peter Orszag , Director of the US Office of Management and Budget said that the coming fiscal consolidation in the US over the next three years will be the country &apos;s deepest retrenchment in 60 years . 
Yet , as I look at the world economy , I see a very different picture - one in which markets &quot; trust in the quality of government liabilities of the global North &apos;s core economies most certainly is not on the brink of collapse . 
I see production 10 % below capacity , and I see unemployment rates approaching 10 % . 
More importantly for near-term economic policy , I see a world in which investors have enormous confidence in core economies &quot; government debt - for many , the only safe port in this storm . 
In these circumstances , we can be sure of what Mill would have recommended .
