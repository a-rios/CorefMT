Japan &apos;s New Monetary Policy 
CAMBRIDGE : The economic world breathed easier when the Bank of Japan announced that it would expand Japan &apos;s money supply in order to boost demand . 
Japan &apos;s stock market soared nearly 10 % , though it has fallen a bit since . 
Worries about Japan - the world &apos;s second-largest economy , gripped by stagnation for years - are high . 
Unless its monetary policy really changes , both America and Japan could fall into recession simultaneously , with risks for all the world . 
In the 1980s , Japan &apos;s economy could do no wrong . 
Its economy grew 4 % annually , much faster than America &apos;s annual 3 % growth . 
In the 1990s , however , Japanese growth averaged less than half of the annual 3.4 % growth of the US . 
Two usual explanations exist for Japan &apos;s poor economic performance . 
One is that Japan still suffers from the collapse of a financial bubble in the late 1980s . 
Steep decline in Japan &apos;s stock and real estate markets at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s left many financial bankruptcies and a weak banking system filled with bad loans . 
Japan &apos;s Government has been rather ineffective in cleaning up the mess , for example by delaying for nearly a decade the re-capitalization of Japanese banks . 
A second explanation is that Japan &apos;s economic structure became rigid because vested interests , especially in construction and services , prevented structural changes . 
Political paralysis also contributed to the lack of structural change . 
These explanations are undoubtedly correct , at least in part . 
But there are stranger aspects to Japan &apos;s sluggish economy . 
After the oil price hikes of 1974 and 1980 , Japan &apos;s economy recovered through export-led growth . 
Each time , the Yen weakened , making Japan &apos;s exports - particularly electronics and automobiles - more competitive internationally . 
This export-led recovery did not occur in the 1990s . 
Why ? 
A partial , little-recognized explanation of Japan &apos;s sluggishness in the 1990s is that export-led recovery was prevented by America and Europe . 
When Japan &apos;s financial bubble burst in 1990 , the exchange rate stood around 140 Yen / 1dollar . 
As the economy weakened , the Yen strengthened , reaching 83 Yen / 1 dollar in 1994 . 
While the Yen later weakened , it remained in the range of 100-120 Yen / 1dollar until recently , when it weakened to around 123 Yen / 1dollar . 
This is strange . 
In a floating exchange rate system , a currency should weaken in the face of chronic weakness in the economy . 
This didn &apos;t happen . 
The direct explanation is that the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy tight , so that the currency did not weaken alongside the economy . 
But a policy like that demands a deeper explanation . 
Was it monetary policy error or something else ? 
If we review debates about Japan since 1988 we recognize the international pressures felt by Japan &apos;s politicians and policymakers . 
In the 1980s , Japan was not seen as a laggard but as a juggernaut who would soon dominate world markets in automobiles , semiconductors , electronics , even finance . 
So American and European leaders insisted that Japan &quot; voluntarily &quot; restrain exports or face steep tariff and non-tariff barriers . 
Japan &apos;s export growth was crippled by these non-market interventions , not by a loss of competitiveness . 
Moreover , the Bush and Clinton Administrations warned that Japan should not export its way out of trouble , as if a trade surplus resulting from export growth was somehow &quot; unfair . &quot; 
Japan is a country with a structural trade surplus - ie , exports are likely to remain above imports on a sustained basis because Japan &apos;s trade surplus results from an excess of national saving over investment . 
With Japan &apos;s high saving rate ( a function of Japan &apos;s aging population ) and with investments held down by rates of return that diminished as Japan invested heavily during the postwar period , Japan &apos;s excess savings naturally sought outlets abroad . 
This translated into exports persistently higher than imports . 
Notwithstanding this economic logic , America told Japan that it must grow through domestic demand , not exports . 
US advice was : cut the savings rate . 
Incredibly , Japan was told to run huge budget deficits ( reducing government saving ) to boost domestic demand . It was the kind of advice you give to others , but never follow yourself . 
Predictably , the results were awful . 
First , Japan &apos;s government ran up enormous debts . 
Second , as government stopped saving , Japanese households saved even more . 
They feared that the government would never be able to pay their pensions when due . 
Thus , higher household savings negated the stimulus of government deficits . 
While government ran large deficits , the Bank of Japan kept the money supply tight . 
That decision came , in part , out of fear of reprisals if the Yen weakened more than American and European politicians deemed &quot; fair . &quot; 
The strong Yen led to weak demand for Japanese products , and an inability to surmount the pile of bad debts through export-led growth . 
Relatively slow growth in the money supply also led to deflation , worsening the problems of bad debts . 
While Japan &apos;s problems are partly due to its own mistakes , both America and Europe bear responsibility for its ongoing debacle . 
It &apos;s time for an expansionary monetary policy in Japan ( and in other parts of Asia ) , even if the Yen weakens , as is likely ( especially against the Euro , but also against the dollar ) . 
Other Asian countries should let their currencies weaken , too . 
If international trade and financial markets are allowed to operate freely , Japan &apos;s recovery will come faster than in the past decade , benefiting the entire world .
