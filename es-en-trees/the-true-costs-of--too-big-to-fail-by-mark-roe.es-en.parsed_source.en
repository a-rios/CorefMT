Measuring the Costs of &quot; Too Big To Fail &quot; 
CAMBRIDGE - The idea that some banks are &quot; too big to fail &quot; has emerged from the obscurity of regulatory and academic debate into the broader public discourse on finance . 
Bloomberg News started the most recent public discussion , criticizing the benefit that such banks receive - a benefit that a study released by the International Monetary Fund has shown to be quite large . 
Bankers &quot; lobbyists and representatives dismissed the Bloomberg editorial for citing a single study , and for relying on rating agencies &quot; rankings for the big banks , which showed that several would have to pay more for their long-term funding if financial markets didn &apos;t expect government support in case of trouble . 
In fact , though , there are about ten recent studies , not just one , concerning the benefit that too-big-to-fail banks receive from the government . 
Nearly every study points in the same direction : a large boost in the too-big-to-fail subsidy during and after the financial crisis , making it cheaper for big banks to borrow . 
But a recent research report released by Goldman Sachs argues the contrary - and deserves to be taken more seriously than previous efforts to dismiss the problem . 
The report concludes that , over time , big banks &quot; advantage in long-term funding costs relative to smaller banks has been one-third of one percentage point ; that this advantage is small ; that it has narrowed recently ( and may be reversing ) ; that it comes from the big banks &quot; efficiency and their bonds &quot; liquidity ; and that historically it has been mostly small banks , not big ones , that have failed . 
Goldman is surely right that the United States has historically propped up small banks that it would not allow to fail . 
The savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980 &quot; s was a $ 100 billion problem . 
The banks that failed during the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s were small banks . 
More perniciously , because small banks , unlike big ones , paid for most of the costs of their failure through an insurance fund , small banks were given local monopolies , for fear that vigorous competition would lead too many to fail . 
Customers suffered because competition was weak . 
The Goldman report seems to be aimed at a recent proposal by Senators Sherrod Brown and David Vitter to increase big banks &quot; capital requirements sharply , while exempting small banks ( presumably to get the small banks &quot; political support , or out of nostalgia for local banking , or because the senators believe that small banks present no regulatory problems ) . 
Because small banks have historically been failure-prone , and have failed en masse , the Brown-Vitter proposal sidesteps a major problem - call it &quot; too-many-to-fail . &quot; 
But , although Goldman is right to widen the focus to include small banks &quot; weakness , doing so undermines the logic underlying its view that the narrowing of the long-term funding-cost advantage implies that America &apos;s banking problems are over . 
Goldman is right that small banks fail and have been protected by government insurance and bailouts ; but that means that the big banks &quot; funding advantage over small banks needs to be added to whatever advantage the small banks themselves have . 
Likewise , if big banks &quot; funding advantage is really not so large now as it was in the past , that narrowing may mean that others understand what the Goldman report is saying : small banks fail , too , and the government or the insurance fund bails them out . 
A narrowing gap in funding costs could just mean that financial markets recognize this . 
Moreover , by measuring the too-big-to-fail subsidy on the basis of banks &quot; long-term bonds , the Goldman report misses much . 
It is a big bank &apos;s short-term debt that sinks it in a crisis , and it is this debt that is bailed out first . 
Big banks , not small banks , are the major players in the market for short-term debt , which makes their bonds riskier than small banks &quot; bonds . 
So , if the market prices the big and small banks &quot; long-term debt similarly , even though the big banks &quot; debt is riskier , something must be giving the big banks &quot; riskier debt a boost . 
US regulators are strongly hinting that they will allow long-term debt to default in a bank failure , while affirming that they will find a way to bail out short-term debt . 
If financial markets view them as likely to follow through , the too-big-to-fail boost may apply more to the big bank &apos;s short-term debt than to any banks &quot; long-term debt . 
And is it right to say that the amount involved - one-third of one percentage point in annual interest savings on long-term debt - is small ? 
Big banks use so much debt nowadays and so much less equity - the ratio is typically ten to one - that a small financing advantage amounts to a large fraction of a bank &apos;s profit . 
Depending on how much long-term debt a bank uses , a financing advantage of one-third of a percentage point can readily amount to 10 % or more of its annual profit . 
That is not small change by anyone &apos;s definition . 
Finally , if we focus on the too-big-to-fail subsidy at any particular time , we miss too much . 
As the economy improves , failure is less likely . 
The banks may remain too big to fail , but , with their chance of failing lower in a more buoyant economy , the immediate subsidy declines . 
It stems from the economic havoc caused by too many financial institutions weakening and unexpectedly failing simultaneously , cutting back on lending , and degrading economic activity overall . 
Mass financial failure is costly , even if no one , big or small , is bailed out .
