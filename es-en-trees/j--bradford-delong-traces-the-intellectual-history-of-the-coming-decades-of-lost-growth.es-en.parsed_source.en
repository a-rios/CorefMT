The Long Short Run 
BERKELEY - Before 2008 , I taught my students that the United States was a flexible economy . 
It had employers who were willing to gamble and hire when they saw unemployed workers who would be productive ; and it had workers who were willing to move to opportunity , or to try something new in order to get a job . 
As bosses and entrepreneurial workers took a chance , supply would create its own demand . 
Yes , I used to say , adverse shocks to spending could indeed create mass unemployment and idle capacity , but their effects would be limited to one , two , or at most three years . 
And each year after the initial downturn had ended , the US economy would recover roughly 40 % of the ground between its current situation and its full employment potential . 
The domain of the Keynesian ( and monetarist ) short run , I said , was 0-2 years . 
When analyzing events at a horizon of 3-7 years , one could safely assume a &quot; classical &quot; model : the economy would return to full employment , while changes in policy and in the economic environment would alter the distribution but not the level of spending , production , and employment . 
Beyond seven years was the domain of economic growth and economic institutions . 
All of this is now revealed as wrong , at least for today , if not in the past or the future . 
Japan since the start of the 1990 &quot; s provides strong evidence that the short run can last for decades , and then be followed not by a return to the old normal , but by a transition to a new normal in which the Keynesian short run of economic depression casts a long shadow . 
What we have seen since 2008 is that Japan is not an exception . 
The default framework for thinking about these questions is a very old one : the market-and-natural-interest-rate framework of Knut Wicksell &apos;s Geldzins und Guterpreis ( &quot; Interest and Prices &quot; ) . 
In every economy , the argument goes , there is a market interest rate determined by the financial system , and there is a natural interest rate - the value at which desired savings at full employment equal desired investment at full employment , and at which the economy as a whole desires neither to leverage nor to deleverage . 
If the economy as a whole desires to leverage up , the result is an inflationary boom . 
If the economy as a whole desires to deleverage , a depression ensues . 
It is then the central bank &apos;s job to intervene in the banking system in order to push the market interest rate to the natural interest rate , thereby balancing the economy at full employment without excess inflation . 
The problem now is that the natural interest rate - that is , the liquid safe nominal interest rate on short-term US Treasury securities - is less than zero . 
Thus , the central bank cannot push the market interest rate there . 
Until something happens to raise the natural interest rate , we are stuck with a depressed economy . 
Some blame a global savings glut for this state of affairs , and call for less thrift . 
But if we were at full employment , we would recognize that the world still has mammoth growth opportunities , and to sacrifice future growth for current well-being is a second-best choice . 
Others blame a global investment shortfall driven by a lack of technological opportunities . 
But , given that this view is expressed in every deep depression , it appears to be an effect of economic stagnation , rather than a cause of it . 
Still others say that the problem would resolve itself , at least in the US , if the target for annual inflation were raised from 2 % to 5 % , because a loss of so much of the real purchasing power that people hoard in cash would induce the needed boost in real investment . 
I think they are probably right , but former central bankers like Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan would warn that a 5 % inflation target is ultimately unsustainable . 
People can be happy with a stable 2 % target ( which is too low to notice ) , but 5 % annual inflation would eventually become 10 % , and 10 % would eventually become 20 % , and then the US would face another deep recession , like in 1982 , or even more unpleasant alternatives . 
Finally , according to a fourth group of economists , centered around Ricardo Caballero of MIT , the problem is a global shortage of safe assets . 
This view translates into policies aimed at better mobilizing society &apos;s financial risk-bearing capacity , and that use the public sector to outwit the forces of time and ignorance that curb willingness to engage in risky investments . 
So we have four theories , all advocated by smart , thoughtful , and hard-working economists . 
In a better world , sophisticated debate in a vibrant public sphere would inform economic policy . 
In the world as it is , we are all Japan in the early 1990 &quot; s , looking ahead to two or more decades of lost economic growth .
