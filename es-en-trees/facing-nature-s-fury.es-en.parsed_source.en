Facing Nature &apos;s Fury 
The Pakistan earthquake continues a streak of shocking natural disasters during the past year : the Indian Ocean tsunami , killer droughts in Niger and other countries in Africa , Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , Central American mudslides , and Portugal &apos;s wildfires . 
These events are unrelated , and humankind &apos;s vulnerability to natural hazards is as old as our species . 
Yet there are also commonalities - and warnings to us all : we are not prepared for these massive shocks , more of which are certain to come . 
Massive population growth has exposed vast numbers of people to new kinds of extreme vulnerability . 
There are now 6.5 billion people on the planet , almost four billion people more than fifty years ago . 
Current trends , according to the United Nations , will push the world &apos;s population up to around 9.1 billion by 2050 . 
As population rises , billions of people crowd into Earth &apos;s vulnerable areas - near coastlines battered by storms and rising sea levels , on mountainsides susceptible to landslides and earthquakes , or in water-stressed regions plagued by drought , famine , and disease . 
Typically , the poorest of the poor are pushed into the riskiest places to live and work - and also to die when natural catastrophes strike . 
Many of the key hazards are increasing in frequency and intensity . 
Climate change is partly responsible . 
Both the number and strength of hurricanes are most likely increasing as a result of rising sea-surface temperatures caused by man-made global warming . 
Earth is set to warm further in the decades ahead , bringing more and bigger fires , mudslides , heat waves , droughts , and powerful hurricanes . 
Similarly , we are also seeing the emergence and spread of new infectious diseases , such as AIDS , SARS , and avian flu . 
As human populations crowd new parts of the planet and come into contact with new animal habitats , new infectious diseases spread from animals to humans . 
Such is the case with AIDS and avian flu . 
Other infectious diseases are likely to emerge , or to become more severe ( as with dengue fever in Asia this year ) , as a result of changes in climate and interaction between human and animal habitats . 
Another common element in all of these disasters is our shocking lack of preparedness , especially to help the poorest members of society . 
After Hurricane Katrina hit the United States , we discovered that President Bush had appointed a crony rather than a professional as head of America &apos;s emergency relief agency . 
Equipment and personnel needed to address the crisis were halfway around the world in Iraq . 
Likewise , Pakistan was substantially ill equipped to deal with the recent earthquake , in part because , like the US , Pakistan over-spends on its military and under-spends on public health and emergency preparedness . 
International relief agencies are also starved for cash and resources . 
Governments should be taking some basic steps . 
First , they should be making careful assessments of the specific kinds of risks their countries face , including risks from epidemics , climate change , extreme weather events , and earthquakes . 
Such assessments require establishing and maintaining a system of high-level and high-quality scientific advising . 
Bush , for example , would vastly improve US and global security if he started listening to top scientists and paid less attention to political lobbyists regarding the growing risks from man-made climate change . 
There is a growing body of expertise to help get the job done . 
The Earth Institute at Columbia University , which I direct , recently completed a global assessment of several kinds of natural hazards , such as droughts , earthquakes , and floods , in partnership with the World Bank . 
Using advanced statistical and mapping methods , they identified how these various threats are arrayed around the world . 
Other colleagues at the Earth Institute , and in similar research institutes , are making careful estimates of how these risks are evolving in view of changes in our planet &apos;s climate , population , and patterns of international travel and human settlement . 
But political leaders are not using this kind of scientific information adequately , owing mainly to deep divides that persist between the scientific community , politicians , and the general public . 
The public is largely unaware of the scientific knowledge we have concerning the threats and risks that we face , and that we can reduce these risks by thinking ahead . 
Politicians , in general , are experts at winning votes or building alliances , rather than at understanding the underlying global processes of climate , energy , disease , and food production that affect all of our planet &apos;s inhabitants . 
Even different groups of scientists - in public health , climate , seismology , and other specialities - do not communicate adequately with one another , despite the fact that today &apos;s threats often cut across different scientific disciplines . 
These gaps between politicians and scientists , and among scientists themselves , must be closed if we are to overcome the risks that we face . 
Nature has reminded us all year of what is at stake . 
The bad news is that the threats will almost surely intensify in the coming years , as our planet becomes even more crowded and subject to man-made change . 
The good news is that we have the science and the technology to address these risks better than we ever have . 
We can build a safer future , but only if we are prepared to use our scientific knowledge and expertise for the common good .
