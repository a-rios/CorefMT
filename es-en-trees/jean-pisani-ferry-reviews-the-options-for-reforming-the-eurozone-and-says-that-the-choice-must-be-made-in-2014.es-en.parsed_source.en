The Eurozone &apos;s Crossroad 
PARIS - Heading into 2014 , financial markets are quiet and Europe &apos;s politicians are relieved , but the fundamental problems that have driven the euro crisis for the last four years remain , and now is the time to address them . 
That is the claim of two important recent papers , one by a bipartisan group of German economists , lawyers , and political scientists called the Glienicker Gruppe , and the other by Ashoka Mody , a former International Monetary Fund official who is now at Princeton University and the European think tank Bruegel . 
Aside from the need to act , however , the authors agree on little else . 
The German group argues that the eurozone &apos;s survival requires a political union equipped with a common budget . 
Mody says that European Union &apos;s federalist plans have been disappointed for five decades , and that the only way forward is to abandon efforts to fine-tune national policies set in Brussels and instead pursue a decentralized union . 
Their shared premise is correct : complacency about the euro crisis is misguided , the fixes adopted so far do not go far enough to ensure lasting stability , and the current respite should be used to design the bloc &apos;s permanent architecture . 
Furthermore , the advent of a bipartisan government coalition in Germany , together with the appointment of a new European administration following the European Parliament election in May , creates a window for new thinking . 
The two papers &quot; disagreement is political , not economic . 
The Glienicker Gruppe argues that a stable monetary union needs a transfer mechanism to help cushion severe economic downturns and a legitimate government to ensure that democracy and the rule of law prevail at all times and in all countries . 
Their point is that the EU has passed the integration threshold beneath which EU members could behave independently . 
The degree of interdependence that the euro has created calls for proportionate instruments to manage common public goods . 
Their idea is that the eurozone could not afford a neo-fascist government in a member country , and that preventing such an outcome requires both carrots ( transfer mechanisms ) and sticks ( supranational powers ) . 
Mody concurs that a political union would enhance the eurozone &apos;s functioning . 
Grand plans , he says , will only end in a muddle , so it would be wiser to accept reality and draw the right conclusions from it : Europe should abandon efforts to create a federation . 
Furthermore , it should rid itself of its technocratic surveillance apparatus , which lacks both legitimacy and effectiveness . 
The arrangement that Mody proposes is one whereby states decide by themselves which fiscal policy they prefer and default if they become insolvent ; banks know that public debt is risky and behave accordingly ; and governments force banks to shrink by refusing to stand behind them and socialize their losses . 
In short , Europe should emulate the late-nineteenth-century United States ( or , perhaps more accurately , the early-twentieth-century gold standard ) . 
Mody &apos;s solution is logically coherent and looks attractive . 
But it is not clear that it would pass the test of reality . 
The state of California &apos;s debt today amounts to about 1 % of US GDP , whereas Italy &apos;s debt represents 18 % of eurozone GDP . 
California &apos;s default would be a secondary event in the US , whereas in the eurozone , an Italian default would impoverish debt holders massively , bring down several banks , and set in motion a dangerous chain reaction . 
To be sure , investors , anticipating such a catastrophe , would refrain from holding Italian bonds , forcing Italy to reduce its public debt . 
In the meantime , the entire eurozone would be vulnerable , while the very transition to the new , lower-debt steady state would add to Europe &apos;s woes . 
Second , a union of the kind imagined by Mody might not be very resilient . 
Deprived of their partners &quot; assistance , member countries could choose to quit . 
Indeed , Greece might have exited by now , had it not received massive financial assistance . 
The two papers thus advance opposite templates for the eurozone &apos;s future , neither of which is without risks . 
If , as they both suggest , Europe &apos;s preference for the middle road is mistaken , and one or the other of the proposed solutions must be chosen , a true dilemma will have to be confronted . 
That would be one more reason to use the current respite to think hard , lay out options , and be candid about preferences and their consequences .
