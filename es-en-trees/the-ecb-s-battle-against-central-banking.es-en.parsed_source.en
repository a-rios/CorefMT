The ECB &apos;s Battle against Central Banking 
BERKELEY - When the European Central Bank announced its program of government-bond purchases , it let financial markets know that it thoroughly disliked the idea , was not fully committed to it , and would reverse the policy as soon as it could . 
Indeed , the ECB proclaimed its belief that the stabilization of government-bond prices brought about by such purchases would be only temporary . 
It is difficult to think of a more self-defeating way to implement a bond-purchase program . 
By making it clear from the outset that it did not trust its own policy , the ECB practically guaranteed its failure . 
If it so evidently lacked confidence in the very bonds that it was buying , why should investors feel any differently ? 
The ECB continues to believe that financial stability is not part of its core business . 
As its outgoing president , Jean-Claude Trichet , put it , the ECB has &quot; only one needle on &#91; its &#93; compass , and that is inflation . &quot; 
The ECB &apos;s refusal to be a lender of last resort forced the creation of a surrogate institution , the European Financial Stability Facility . 
Perhaps the most astonishing thing about the ECB &apos;s monochromatic price-stability mission and utter disregard for financial stability - much less for the welfare of the workers and businesses that make up the economy - is its radical departure from the central-banking tradition . 
Modern central banking got its start in the collapse of the British canal boom of the early 1820 &quot; s . 
During the financial crisis and recession of 1825-1826 , a central bank - the Bank of England - intervened in the interest of financial stability as the irrational exuberance of the boom turned into the remorseful pessimism of the bust . 
In his book Lombard Street , Walter Bagehot quoted Jeremiah Harman , the governor of the Bank of England in the 1825-1826 crisis : 
&quot; We lent ... by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted before ; we took in stock on security , we purchased exchequer bills , we made advances on exchequer bills , we not only discounted outright , but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an immense amount , in short , by every possible means consistent with the safety of the Bank , and we were not on some cases over-nice . 
Seeing the dreadful state in which the public were , we rendered every assistance in our power ... &quot; 
The Bank of England &apos;s charter did not give it the legal authority to undertake such lender-of-last-resort financial-stability operations . 
But the Bank undertook them anyway . 
Half a generation later , Britain &apos;s Parliament debated whether the modifications of the Bank &apos;s charter should give it explicit power to conduct lender-of-last-resort operations . 
The answer was no : granting explicit power would undermine confidence in price stability , for already there was &quot; difficulty restrain &#91; ing &#93; over-issue , depreciation , and fraud . &quot; 
Indeed , granting explicit lender-of-last-resort powers to the Bank of England would mean that the &quot; millennium of the paper-mongers would be at hand . &quot; 
But the leaders of Parliament also believed that the absence of a codified authority to act as lender of last resort would not keep the Bank of England from doing so when necessity commanded . 
As First Lord of the Treasury Sir Robert Peel wrote : &quot; If it be necessary to assume a grave responsibility , I dare say men will be willing to assume such a responsibility . &quot; 
Our current political and economic institutions rest upon the wager that a decentralized market provides a better social-planning , coordination , and capital-allocation mechanism than any other that we have yet been able to devise . 
But , since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , part of that system has been a central financial authority that preserves trust that contracts will be fulfilled and promises kept . 
Time and again , the lender-of-last-resort role has been an indispensable part of that function . 
That is what the ECB is now throwing away .
