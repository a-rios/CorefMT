Two Policy Prescriptions for the Global Crisis 
WASHINGTON , DC - One thing that experts know , and that non-experts do not , is that they know less than non-experts think they do . 
This much was evident at the just-completed Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group - three intense days of talks that brought together finance ministers , central bankers , and other policymakers . 
Our economic expertise is limited in fundamental ways . 
Consider monetary and fiscal policies . 
Despite decades of careful data collection and mathematical and statistical research , on many large questions we have little more than rules of thumb . 
For example , we know that we should lower interest rates and inject liquidity to fight stagnation , and that we should raise policy rates and banks &quot; cash-reserve ratios to stifle inflation . 
Sometimes we rely on our judgment in combining interest-rate action with open-market operations . 
But the fact remains that our understanding of these policies &quot; mechanics is rudimentary . 
These rules of thumb work ( at least tolerably so ) as a result of evolution . 
Over time , the wrong moves are penalized , and their users either learn by watching others or disappear . 
We get our monetary and fiscal policies right the same way that birds build their nests right . 
As with all behaviors shaped by evolution , when the environment changes , there is a risk that existing adaptations become dysfunctional . 
This has been the fate of some of our standard macroeconomic policies . 
The formation of the eurozone and a half-century of relentless globalization have altered the global economic landscape , rendering once-proven policies ineffective . 
When Sweden &apos;s Riksbank was founded in 1668 , followed by the Bank of England in 1694 , the motivation was that a single economy should have a single central bank . 
Over the next three centuries , as the benefits of instituting a monopoly over money creation became more widely recognized , a slew of central banks were established , one for each politically bounded economy . 
What was not anticipated was that globalization would erode these boundaries . 
As a result , we have returned to a past from which we tried to escape - a single economy , in this case the world , with multiple money-creating authorities . 
This is clearly maladaptive , and it explains why the massive injections of liquidity by advanced-country central banks are failing to jump-start economies and create more jobs . 
After all , in a globalized economy , much of this liquidity spills across political boundaries , giving rise to inflationary pressures in distant lands and precipitating the risk of currency wars , while unemployment at home remains dangerously high , threatening to erode workers &quot; skills . 
The long-run damage could be devastating . 
What was evident at the World Bank / IMF Spring Meetings was that virtually all policymakers are distressed and no one has a complete answer . 
Neither do I. But here are two simple ideas that could help to mitigate the crisis . 
First , in the absence of a single global central-banking authority , a modicum of monetary-policy coordination among major economies is required . 
We need a group of the major economies - call it &quot; G Major &quot; - that announces monetary policies in a coordinated fashion . 
To see why , consider the case of Japan . 
Japanese policymakers have good reason to try to promote some inflation and even correct some of the yen &apos;s secular appreciation over the last six or seven years . 
But , in today &apos;s unilateral world , other central banks would soon respond by injecting liquidity , prompting the Bank of Japan to act again . 
These actions are usually justified as policies for boosting domestic demand , but they end up fueling a surrogate , low-grade currency war . 
If , however , the G Major economies issued quarterly announcements of significant upcoming policy changes - for example , a small round of quantitative easing by country X , a larger liquidity injection by countries Y and Z , and so on - markets would be reassured that a currency war was not being fought . 
Exchange-rate movements would be minimal and only as intended , and volatility would be contained , because tit-for-tat injections would no longer occur and speculation would wane . 
Moreover , liquidity injections would be likely to have a greater impact on demand , because synchronization would reduce leakage across national boundaries . 
The second recommendation pertains to the mechanics of liquidity injection , much of which takes place nowadays - in Europe , Japan , and elsewhere - through asset purchases . 
The US Federal Reserve , for example , is currently purchasing assets ( many of them mortgage-backed ) worth $ 85 billion each month . 
Liquidity injections and low interest rates have a microeconomic effect that has received little attention : they lower the cost of capital vis-Ã -vis the cost of labor , which causes a relative decline in demand for labor . 
This is very likely exacerbating the unemployment problem ; it certainly is not mitigating it . 
One solution is to channel part of the liquidity injections toward countering this factor-cost asymmetry . 
Thus , for every $ 100 of new liquidity , we could use $ 60 to purchase assets and the remainder to give firms a marginal job-creation subsidy , which could be especially effective in economies with flexible labor markets that enable short-term hiring . 
Even if the employment subsidy were offered only for , say , one year , firms would be tempted to use more labor during this time . 
And , because the current bout of high unemployment is self-reinforcing , once the equilibrium is broken for a while , the economy could move to a higher-employment equilibrium permanently , without the need for any further government support . 
This prescription has one problem . 
Asset purchases have no balance-sheet effect , because assets replace money . 
Subsidizing labor , by contrast , is a pure injection of liquidity . 
However , for precisely that reason , an employment subsidy is likely to be more effective in boosting demand , which implies that a smaller injection of this kind is likely to boost demand as much as a larger asset purchase would . 
Among the few certainties in crafting economic policy is the need to adapt to external change . 
Our challenge is like that of Industrial Revolution-era moths , which adapted to their new soot-laden environment by becoming darker ( and thus better able to hide from predators ) . 
In a globalized economy , national policymakers should not be left circling light bulbs .
