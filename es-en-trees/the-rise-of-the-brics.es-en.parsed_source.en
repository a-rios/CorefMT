The Rise of the BRICs 
PRINCETON  -  
The East Asian tigers that pushed themselves onto the world economy &apos;s center stage were small units , and in some cases - Singapore , Taiwan , or Hong Kong - were not even treated as states . 
Even South Korea , which is a giant in comparison , was only half a country . 
Such states are vulnerable , and the past is littered with small and successful globalizers that lost out because of power politics : the Italian city states of the Renaissance , the Dutch Republic , or , in the twentieth century , Lebanon and Kuwait . 
Small states frequently became the victims of larger but poorer neighbors envious of their success and eager to seize their assets , while oblivious to the fact that such seizure actually destroys the source of wealth and dynamism . 
In the world of pure globalization , small states do best , because they are more flexible and can adapt more easily to rapidly changing markets . 
Small states are better at public policy adjustments , freeing up labor markets , establishing a solid framework for competition , and facilitating cross-border takeovers and mergers . 
The urgency of such a program has been underscored in much recent analysis of the poor performance of the major continental European economies - France , Germany , and Italy - compared with smaller and much more dynamic economies in northern and central Europe . 
But , at the same time , small states are also more likely to be successful in defending crucial aspects of the welfare state . 
A larger state can inevitably do more to control the economy , and hence is exposed to the costly temptation to intervene in response to political pressure from vested interests . 
In a small-state setting , imposition of a dense network of controls is likely to lead to the loss of mobile factors of production , while in a large state it is harder for labor or capital to escape . 
On the international stage , large states try to make international rules , and often build their domestic legitimacy on their claims to be able to shape a larger world : they think in terms of what French thinkers call &quot; harnessing globalization . &quot; 
Instead of accepting the international system roughly as it is , with all its imperfections , they think that they can use their weight to alter the rules - in their favor . 
Small states &quot; nervousness and fear began to increase roughly in 2000 . 
The new political realities were highlighted by the Iraq war , China &apos;s search for energy sources in developing countries , and Russia &apos;s assertiveness in foreign and domestic policy . 
In today &apos;s world , it looks as if the new winners are big states with large populations and rapid growth : Brazil , Russia , India , and China ( BRICs ) , in addition to the United States . 
These dynamic giants terrify the wealthy populations of the industrialized world with the potential power of their low-cost competition , cheap products , and outsourcing of services . 
The BRICs ( we might rewrite the term as Big and Really Imperial Countries ) project power more easily , but they also need to project power to compensate for their weaknesses . 
They have their own problems , but at the same time they are likely to behave more like traditional big states , and will try to shape globalization rather than simply accepting it as an inevitable process . 
There are at least three obvious flaws that afflict these big globalizers much more than the small globalizers who had done so well previously . 
First , highly populous countries must integrate their poor and ill-educated underclass ( in China and India mostly rural ) as they engage with world markets . 
Second , China and Russia have financial systems that lack transparency , while Brazil and India are financially underdeveloped , putting further integration in the world economy at risk and increasing prospects for a financial crisis . 
Third , Russia is already facing massive demographic decline and an aging and sickening population ; 
China faces the near certainty of a Japanese-style demographic downturn from the 2040 &quot; s onward , a belated legacy of its one-child policy . 
Flawed geo-political giants have in the past been a source of instability ( Germany before World War I is an obvious analogy ) , and there are good reasons to see them presenting increased risk in the twenty-first century . 
But for the moment they are unquestionably powerful . 
The result is that the BRICs will look for compensating power , and military and strategic influence and prestige , as a way to solve internal problems . 
Gone are the 1990 &quot; s , when for a brief moment in the immediate aftermath of the end of the Cold War , the world looked as if it would be permanently peaceful and unconcerned with power . 
That hope soon proved illusory . 
Many commentators , indeed , were stunned by the rapidity with which tensions returned to the international system . 
While many blame US behavior , these tensions have in fact been fueled by the unfolding of a new logic in international politics .
