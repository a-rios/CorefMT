California Bad Dreaming 
STANFORD - While central governments &quot; fiscal problems plague many economies , a parallel crisis is enveloping many subnational governments around the world . 
From Spain to China to the United States to Italy , these governments - regions , states , provinces , cities , and towns - face immense fiscal challenges . 
Higher levels of government are &quot; on the hook &quot; to bail out local insolvent governments , and may even suffer bond downgrades as a result ; in Spain , Italy , and China , that role falls to the national government , and for US cities and towns , to their states . 
There are many similarities within and among countries in terms of the nature and causes of these local fiscal calamities . 
Local officials used growing revenues during the boom to fund pet projects or boost pay and benefits , with little regard to future costs . 
In the downturn , revenues and subsidies from the central government collapsed and the bills came due . 
Creative accounting gimmicks masked the full extent of the problem . 
Now comes the reckoning . 
To finance local businesses , Chinese local governments use local-government financing vehicles ( LGFVs ) to circumvent bans on direct borrowing . 
In Spain , housing and employment collapses have hammered revenue . 
Rumors of an imminent default swirl around Sicily , whose governor has resigned as borrowing soared after cutbacks from Rome . 
A new report from a task force co-chaired by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker indicates that unfunded pension and health-care costs make many American states &quot; medium- and longer-run fiscal prospects bleak . 
California &apos;s fiscal crises may also provide lessons for subnational governments around the world . 
Three California cities have recently declared bankruptcy : Stockton , the largest American city ever to do so ; 
Compton is rumored to be next ; most observers expect more to follow . 
The state faces another large budget deficit , yet Governor Jerry Brown &apos;s budget this year includes a substantial spending increase . 
Brown &apos;s ballot initiative this November would raise California &apos;s top personal income-tax rate to 13.3 % , the nation &apos;s highest . 
According to Brown , the tax hike would be temporary , yet it would last seven years . 
Meanwhile , he claims to be tough on California &apos;s notoriously well-paid and powerful public-employee unions by negotiating a 5 % pay cut . 
Cities are declaring bankruptcy to escape the pressure of exponentially rising pension and health costs . 
In contrast to the state , cities have even cut back essential services , including 20 % reductions in police and fire personnel . 
Bankruptcy should allow local governments to renegotiate their bond debt and , perhaps , their retired employees &quot; pension and health-care costs ( that &apos;s up to a bankruptcy judge ) . 
The state would be expected to take over essential public services from bankrupt local governments . 
But the state itself is in dire financial straits ; one of the cities &quot; problems is the sharp curtailment of state funds to localities . 
Despite these problems , Brown has committed California to a San Francisco-to-Los Angeles high-speed rail boondoggle . 
To get the cost projections down to $ 68 billion from a $ 100 billion estimate , some existing low-speed rail will be used , likely doubling the time it takes to travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco to 5-6 hours . 
California will most likely be unable to pay for the entire project , leaving little use for the first segment in the sparsely populated Central Valley . 
And , if the project somehow is completed , it will be a not-so-high-speed rail that will drain badly needed resources from other essential government services for many decades . 
These sorry episodes reveal some important lessons . 
One-party government weakens accountability and breeds hubris . 
The California legislature has been controlled by the Democratic Party for decades , and it takes its cue from its party &apos;s most powerful special interests : public-employee unions , environmentalists , trial lawyers , and teachers &quot; unions . 
They have concocted an extremely progressive social experiment : with 12 % of the US population , California has more than 30 % of its welfare dependents . 
From the mid-1980 &quot; s to 2005 , California &apos;s population grew by 10 million , while Medicaid recipients soared by seven million ; tax filers paying income taxes rose by just 150,000 ; and the prison population swelled by 115,000 . 
The state income tax is not only uncompetitively high , but the revenues are volatile . 
In the economic and stock-market upswing , revenues roll in far more rapidly than incomes rise , owing to the extremely progressive income tax ( in good years , the top 1 % pays about half the state &apos;s income taxes ) . 
The legislature spends it as if the elevated revenues will continue forever . 
Then the inevitable recession and stock-market collapse plunges the state into crisis . 
The progressive social experiment has gone so severely off-track that the state cannot even dependably provide essential services , from courts to education , for the most needy . 
Not surprisingly , California &apos;s economy , which used to outperform the rest of the US , now substantially underperforms . 
The unemployment rate , at 10.8 % , is almost one-third higher than the national average , and higher than every other state except Nevada and Rhode Island . 
California still has great strengths in technology , entertainment , and agriculture . 
But citizens and politicians alike must agree to target services far more carefully ; reform the tax system with lower rates on a broader base of economic activity and people ( almost half pay no state income tax ) ; and modernize inefficient state programs to spend less and produce far better outcomes . 
Not coincidentally , that &apos;s a perfect prescription for bloated , debt-ridden central and subnational governments worldwide .
