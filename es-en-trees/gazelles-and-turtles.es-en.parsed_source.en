Gazelles and Turtles 
MUNICH - The world &apos;s worst post-war financial crisis is over . 
It arrived suddenly in 2008 , and , after roughly 18 months , vanished almost as quickly as it had come . 
Bank rescue programs on the order of € 5 trillion and Keynesian stimulus programs on the order of a further € 1 trillion staved off collapse . 
After falling 0.6 % in 2009 , world GDP is expected to grow this year by 4.6 % , and by 4.3 % in 2011 , according to International Monetary Fund forecasts - faster than average growth over the last three decades . 
The European debt crisis , however , remains , and markets do not fully trust the current calm . 
The risk premia that financially distressed countries must pay remain high and signal continuing risk . 
Greek interest rate premiums relative to Germany on ten-year government bonds stood at 8.6 % on August 20th , which is even higher than at the end of April when Greece became practically insolvent and European Union-wide rescue measures were prepared . 
The spreads for Ireland and Portugal have also been rising , even though by the end of July it seemed that the gigantic € 920 billion rescue package put together by the EU , the eurozone countries , the IMF , and the European Central Bank would calm the markets . 
The world is currently divided into two groups of countries : those that are off to a strong recovery , and those that lag behind and are signaling new problems . 
The BRIC countries - Brazil , Russia , India , and China - are in the first group . 
Even Russia , where the upswing was difficult and hesitant , is expected to grow by 4.3 % this year . 
China remains the champion , with a growth rate around 10 % . 
The second group consists of countries with debt problems , above all the United States . 
While the US is expected to grow by 3.3 % this year and by 2.9 % next year - roughly the long-term average for the past 30 years , this cannot be called a self-sustained upswing , given that the fiscal deficit is expected to reach a breathtaking 11 % of GDP this year , before easing to a still-high 8.2 % in 2011 . 
While the US no longer suffers from rising unemployment , the current 9.5 % jobless rate is very high for the US , roughly double its level before the recession . 
The problem remains the real-estate market , whose collapse caused the crisis . 
The Case-Shiller index for single-family homes seemed to have recovered in spring 2009 , after a 34 % decline relative to the last boom . 
But home prices since then have been flat and show no visible trend . 
Construction of new single-family homes in May 2010 was at its lowest point since this indicator &apos;s introduction in 1963 . 
Commercial real-estate prices fell from May to June this year by an alarming 4 % . 
All this has negative implications for US consumption , for the building industry , and for the banking system . 
Moreover , despite the recent banking reform legislation , the US has not yet resolved the structural deficiencies of its capital markets . 
The main problem is that the flow of foreign credit has been impaired because US mortgage-backed securities and the derivatives based on them have become nearly unsellable everywhere . 
That market has simply disintegrated , with annual emissions volume plummeting 97 % - from $ 1.9 trillion to just $ 50 billion - between 1996 and 2009 . 
Nearly all ( 95 % ) of housing finance in 2009 had to go through the state agencies Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and Ginnie Mae to prevent a complete collapse of the US economy . 
In Europe , the picture is also mixed . 
The former boom countries - Greece , Ireland , and Spain - remain in recession , and their GDPs will continue to shrink . 
The unemployment rate in Spain , one of Europe &apos;s large economies , has sky-rocked to 20 % and still shows no sign of improving . 
The Spanish economy contracted by 3.6 % in 2009 , and is expected to shrink by 0.4 % this year . 
For Finland , Britain , and Italy , below-average growth rates are expected . 
But Europe &apos;s biggest economy , Germany , is experiencing a surprisingly strong economic upswing . 
The Ifo business-cycle indicator is now clearly in &quot; boom &quot; territory , with regard both to expectations and to assessments of the current situation . 
In fact , in its 50-year history , the indicator never climbed as steeply as it has over the past 12 months . 
Germany , the laggard of Europe for many years , is expected to grow by about 3 % or more this year , while the average of the EU-15 ( and the EU-27 ) stands at only 1.1 % . 
The German labor market , too , has shown a miraculous turnaround . 
The unemployment rate , now at 7 % , is slightly lower than it was even at the peak of the last boom , in autumn 2008 , and is expected to decline . 
On the other hand , France , Europe &apos;s second biggest economy , is struggling . 
Its unemployment rate is currently 10 % , and GDP growth this year will be in the vicinity of 1.3 % , only slightly above the EU average . 
Whereas Germany &apos;s unemployment rate is now a bit lower than in the last boom , the French rate is significantly higher than in the last slump ( 2004-2005 ) . 
The explanation for this divided world is that countries like Greece , Spain , and the US , which experienced a long boom financed by huge capital imports , now face growing difficulties in finding foreign finance . 
By contrast , countries that exported capital now enjoy an excess of liquidity because capital is shying away from &quot; saturated &quot; countries . 
This excess supply of credit results in additional consumption and investment , triggering a boom . 
The western world is currently experiencing a process of portfolio rebalancing , which is reversing the international ranking of growth rates relative to those before the crisis . 
Former champions are now limping around the track ; former turtles are sprinting like gazelles .
