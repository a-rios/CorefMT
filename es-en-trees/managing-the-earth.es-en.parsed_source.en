Managing the Earth 
Sometime in the next twenty years , the relationship between human beings and the natural world is going to change , profoundly and forever . 
It won &apos;t happen suddenly , but current scientific developments will make change inevitable . 
Like it or not , ready or not , these scientific developments are putting us on the road to becoming the managers of the global ecosystem , rather than just a participant in it . 
I like to think about this coming revolution in historical terms . 
For most of the three and a half million years that beings we might call &quot; human &quot; have walked the Earth , they were unambiguously part of the natural system . 
The iron laws of evolution governed their survival , and those who couldn &apos;t compete died early and were soon forgotten . 
Our only defenses against a hostile world were primitive stone tools and fire - a minimal kind of protection at best . 
Then , about 10,000 years ago , something extraordinary happened . 
Somewhere in the Taurus mountains in what is now Turkey , a group of people , probably women , began to develop a new set of technologies that would change the way that human beings interacted with their environment . 
We call these technologies &quot; agriculture , &quot; and , for the first time , they gave human beings the power to move outside the laws of natural selection . 
No longer would our ancestors have to content themselves with the food that nature offered - they could start to grow their own , far surpassing nature &apos;s meager supply . 
Since the birth of agriculture , human history has been a steady progression of further liberation from the restraints of nature . 
Instead of generating power using human and animal muscles , we developed machines that could liberate sunlight stored in coal and oil . 
Instead of relying on natural defenses against diseases , we developed antibiotics and the other tools of modern medicine . 
The result is that human beings are no longer really a part of nature - the survival of our species no longer depends on our ability to compete in the Darwinian jungle . 
We depend on our social structure and technology , rather than on our genes . 
Today , we are poised to take another giant step , one that will bring us back into the natural system of our planet rather than remove us farther from it . 
For the first time in history , we are starting to understand how the living things around us work , how all the pieces fit together . 
Some of these advances are theoretical , allowing us to build computer models of complex systems like continent-wide forests or entire oceans . 
Others are more mundane , involving long-term experiments and observation of smaller ecosystems , such as plots of prairie grass or swamplands . 
Finally , of course , we have the spectacular advances in our knowledge of genomics , the science that lets us understand the basic mechanisms that operate inside all living systems , including humans . 
Together these new areas of science will allow us to manage the ecosystems on our planet , predicting the effects of human interventions , anticipating the flow of natural cycles . 
We truly have the power to become the managers of planet Earth . 
This is not a responsibility we can shirk . 
The analogy I like to use involves the homely example of caring for a suburban lawn . 
You can decide to mow the grass , in which case you produce one kind of ecosystem , one kind of future . 
Or you can decide not to mow the grass , in which case you produce another kind of ecosystem , another kind of future . 
Either way , your actions determine what happens to the lawn . 
The one thing you cannot do is fail to decide . 
No matter what you do , even if you decide to do nothing , the future of the lawn depends on you . 
In fact , our relation to the planet will be like that of a gardener to a garden . 
The gardener doesn &apos;t destroy his plants indiscriminately , but he does regularly pull up weeds . 
The gardener doesn &apos;t &quot; conquer &quot; his or her plants , but studies them to produce the garden that is desired . 
Most importantly , the gardener does not manage the garden for the sake of the plants , but for some other goal - to raise food , produce flowers , or just to look pretty . 
In the same way , human beings are on the brink of being able to manage the planet , and the decisions we make will determine what the future of the planet will be . 
Given the phenomenal rate at which science advances these days , it is not too early to start thinking about how we are going to handle this awesome new responsibility .
