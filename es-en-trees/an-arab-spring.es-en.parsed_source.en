An Arab Spring ? 
PARIS - Is Tunisia the first Arab authoritarian domino to fall ? 
Or is it a unique case that should not be viewed as a precedent for either the Arab world in general or the Maghreb in particular ? 
The region &apos;s dictators have sought to dismiss the &quot; Jasmine Revolution , &quot; but the spark that started in Tunisia could spread - perhaps in a matter of months or years - to the entire Arab world . 
Indeed , the wall of fear has crumbled , the people have spoken , and an &quot; Arab spring &quot; could be at hand . 
The message from Tunisia , at least so far , is clear : corrupt and authoritarian regimes , beware : unless you reform deeply and quickly , your days are numbered . 
The greatest danger is that the Jasmine Revolution could go the way of Romania &apos;s anti-communist uprising of 20 years ago , with the old regime &apos;s underlings expelling their bosses in order to stay in power . 
But the best analogy for Tunisia today is Spain in the years preceding and following the death of Francisco Franco . 
By opening itself to the world through tourism , and with its emphasis on education and women &apos;s rights , Ben Ali &apos;s regime created something unique in the Middle East : a vibrant middle class . 
Given this , it would seem wrong , if not dangerous , to compare Tunisia and its Jasmine Revolution to other national contexts in the region . 
Nevertheless , if Morocco looks stable today , this largely reflects two factors : monarchy and reform . 
Led by a group of technocrats surrounding the young King Mohammed VI , a reform process - including political liberalization - has begun in earnest , even if the results still seem modest . 
Moreover , Mohammed VI , as &quot; Commander of the Believers , &quot; benefits from a &quot; Muslim &quot; legitimacy that the leaders of Algeria and Egypt , two of the region &apos;s most vulnerable regimes , do not possess . 
And Morocco , contrary to Algeria , does not suffer from the curse of oil . 
Even if the case of Tunisia is largely unique , it would be shortsighted to dismiss its potential influence elsewhere in the region , where many young Arabs in this age of Facebook and Twitter now &quot; feel Tunisian . &quot; 
They , too , are humiliated by their leaders &quot; performance and , more deeply , their vulgar despotic essence . 
They , too , thirst for freedom . 
Whatever the Jasmine Revolution &apos;s outcome , and even if it cannot become for the Arab world what the fall of the Berlin Wall was for Europe , it will establish a &quot; before &quot; and an &quot; after . &quot; 
The &quot; after &quot; is likely to highlight two potential models of political development for the Arab world : Turkey and Iran . 
If the revolutionary wave that began in Tunisia spreads to the rest of the Arab world , how many countries will be tempted by Turkish openness , and how many by Iranian fundamentalism ? 
Of course , that is a somewhat simplistic dichotomy . 
There are grey areas in the Turkish experiment with &quot; moderate Islam , &quot; and , beyond Iran &apos;s Mullahs , there are reasons for hope in the vibrant and resilient character of that country &apos;s civil society . 
What is clear is the West &apos;s preference for the Turkish model . 
Most Europeans may want to keep Turkey at a reasonable distance , but , confronted with changes and possible disorder , if not chaos , in the Arab world , they look favorably on Turkey &apos;s potential to play a stabilizing role . 
To be sure , history never repeats itself , but could some kind of neo-Ottoman order be the best answer to the risk of &quot; Arab chaos &quot; ? 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan &apos;s Turkey already plays a growing role in the region , and has strengthened its image with ordinary Arabs by taking a muscular diplomatic position against Israel &apos;s deadly military assault in June 2010 on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla that had been organized by a Turkish charity . 
But it is one thing to be popular and another to serve as a model . 
Turkey is demonstrating that Islam and modernity are compatible . 
It would be dangerous to assume that after Tunisia , democracy in the Arab world is just around the corner . 
For better or worse , history is on the move in the Arab world - and there is very little the West can do about it .
