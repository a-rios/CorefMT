Raúl Castro &apos;s China Strategy 
MEXICO CITY  -  
Raúl replaced Fidel as President of the Councils of Ministers and of State , but not as First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party . 
And , in a scene worthy of the glory years of Stalinism , Raúl received the unanimous permission of Cuba &apos;s &quot; parliament &quot; to consult with Fidel on all major issues . 
As long as Fidel is around - writing , meeting foreign dignitaries , and weighing in on everything from ethanol to the American presidential campaign - two things will remain clear . 
First , Raúl will barely be able to budge even on the modest , strictly economic and regulatory reforms that he hopes , somewhat naïvely , will put food back on Cubans &quot; table . 
Second , while the succession arrangement that the Castros designed years ago has the advantage of stability and predictability , Raúl will be unable to replace the old guard with younger leaders ( his successor in the Armed Forces is 72 and his vice-president is 77 ) . 
Doing so would give whomever he chooses an edge when Raúl , who is 76 , passes on , and he and Fidel do not necessarily agree on who should come next . 
Raúl &apos;s strategy is to pursue a Vietnamese or Chinese solution : pro-market economic reforms under continued Communist rule , with no progress on democracy or human rights . 
For those in the United States who have rightly concluded that the half-century trade embargo has proved counter-productive , this is an appealing halfway response that provides an alibi for moderation : one day , economic reforms will bring political change . 
For Latin American pragmatists , always fearful of Cuban fifth columnists , it offers a way to square the circle : encouraging change in Cuba without going too far . 
And , for some European governments , it is a typical hands-off remedy that places the problem squarely in America &apos;s lap . 
But the Vietnamese or Chinese roads are unacceptable in Latin America , which has made huge progress in transforming advances in democracy and respect for human rights into a regional legal order that goes beyond national sovereignty or the sacrosanct principle of non-intervention . 
After decades of coups , dictatorships , torture , and disappearances , Latin America today , while not devoid of these plagues , has built a number of firewalls to forestall them . 
Accepting a Cuban exception would represent an enormous setback . 
What will deter the next Central American dictator and murderer if the Cubans are given a free pass ? 
Invoking pragmatism to justify continued human rights violations in Cuba merely because economic reforms might dissuade a mass exodus to Mexico and Florida is a bad idea . 
Mexico has seemed especially tempted to return to its Cuban complicity of the past . 
It appears that during an upcoming visit to Havana , the Mexican foreign minister will not meet with local dissidents , breaking with precedents established since 1993 . 
There are sound reasons to set a timetable for Cuba &apos;s return to the Latin American democratic fold , without imposing elections as a first step or precondition . 
Indeed , free and fair elections and full respect for human rights can come at the end of the road - if that end is clearly established . 
What would be unacceptable are the two extremes : making an immediate transition to democratic rule a precondition for normalization of relations with the US and re-entering the Latin American community , or exempting Cuba from the obligation to adhere to democratic principles and practices on the grounds that it is somehow different . 
In 1953 , Fidel Castro , in what is probably the best-known speech in Latin American political history , proclaimed in court that history would absolve him . 
In fact , history will judge him , and his nearly 50 years in power , only when the results are in : when the initial achievements in health and education and combating inequality are evaluated according to international standards and with the transparency to which the rest of the region &apos;s countries are subject . 
Only then we will know if the trade-off at least made sense , even if for many it was unacceptable : authentic social justice and progress in exchange for authoritarian rule , international ostracism , and a cultural desert .
