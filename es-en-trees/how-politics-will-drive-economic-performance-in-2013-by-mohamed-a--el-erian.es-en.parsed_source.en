The Political Economy of 2013 
NEWPORT BEACH - Watching America &apos;s leaders scramble in the closing days of 2012 to avoid a &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; that would plunge the economy into recession was yet another illustration of an inconvenient truth : messy politics remains a major driver of economic developments . 
In some cases during 2012 , politics was a force for good : consider Prime Minister Mario Monti &apos;s ability to pull Italy back from the brink of financial turmoil . 
Close and defining linkages between politics and economics are likely to persist in 2013 . 
Having said this , we should also expect much greater segmentation in terms of impact - and that the consequences will affect both individual countries and the global system as a whole . 
In some countries - for example , Italy , Japan , and the United States - politics will remain the primary driver of economic-policy approaches . 
This duality in causation speaks to a world that will become more heterogeneous in 2013 - and in at least two ways : it will lack unifying political themes , and it will be subject to multi-speed growth and financial dynamics that imply a range of possible scenarios for multilateral policy interactions . 
With an election looming in Italy , the country &apos;s technocratic interim administration will return the reins of power to a democratically elected government . 
The question , both for Italy and Europe as a whole , is whether the new government will maintain the current economic policy stance or shift to one that is less acceptable to the country &apos;s external partners ( particularly Germany and the European Central Bank ) . 
Monti may or may not be involved in the new government . 
The further removed from it he is , the greater the temptation will be to alter the policy approach in response to popular pressures . 
This would involve less emphasis on fiscal and structural reforms , raising concerns in Berlin , Brussels , and Frankfurt . 
Japan &apos;s incoming government has already signaled an economic-policy pivot , relying on what it directly controls ( fiscal policy ) , together with pressure on the Bank of Japan , to relax the monetary-policy stance , in an effort to generate faster growth and higher inflation . 
In the process , officials are weakening the yen . 
They will also try to lower Japan &apos;s dependence on exports and rethink sending production facilities to lower-wage countries . 
The economic impact of politics in the US , while important , will be less dynamic : absent a more cooperative Congress , politics will mute policy responses rather than fuel greater activism . 
Continued congressional polarization would maintain policy uncertainty , confound debt and deficit negotiations , and impede economic growth . 
From stymieing medium-term fiscal reforms to delaying needed overhauls of the labor and housing markets , congressional dysfunction would keep US economic performance below its capacity ; over time , it would also eat away at potential output . 
In other countries , the causal direction will run primarily from economics to politics . 
In Egypt and Greece , for example , rising poverty , high unemployment , and financial turmoil could place governments under pressure . 
Popular frustration may not wait for the ballot box . 
In China , the credibility of the incoming leadership will depend in large part on whether the economy can consolidate its soft landing . 
Specifically , any prolonged period of sub-7 % growth could encourage opposition and dissent - not only in the countryside , but also in urban centers . 
Then there is Germany , which holds the key to the integrity and unity of the eurozone . 
So far , Chancellor Angela Merkel has been largely successful in insulating the German economy from the turmoil elsewhere in Europe . 
Unemployment has remained remarkably low and confidence relatively high . 
While some would have favored greater policy activism , Merkel &apos;s Germany has provided a steady anchor for a eurozone struggling to end bouts of financial instability and put an end to questions about its survival as a well-functioning monetary union ( one that aspires to becoming much more ) . 
A change in German leadership would , therefore , raise questions about Europe &apos;s policy underpinning . 
How politics and economics interact nationally and globally is one of the important questions for 2013 and beyond . 
There are three scenarios : good economics and effective politics provide the basis for a growing and more cooperative global economy ; bad economics interact with dysfunctional politics to ruin the day ; or the world muddles through , increasingly unstable , as a tug of war between economics and politics plays out , with no clear result or direction . 
Part of the answer depends on what happens in three countries in particular - China , Germany , and the US . 
Their economic and political stability is essential to the well-being of a world economy that has yet to recover fully from the 2008 global financial crisis . 
Current indications , albeit incomplete , suggest that the three will continue to anchor the global economy in 2013 . 
That is the good news . 
The bad news is that their anchor may remain both tentative and insufficient to restore the level of growth and financial stability to which billions of people aspire .
