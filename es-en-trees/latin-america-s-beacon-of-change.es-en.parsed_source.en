Latin America &apos;s Beacon of Change 
BOGOTA - Next month , Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos will host the sixth Summit of the Americas . 
Every Latin American leader except Cuba &apos;s - 32 altogether - will attend to discuss an ambitious agenda of regional cooperation . 
The event could mark the high point of Santos &apos;s 19-month-old presidency . 
External perceptions of Colombia have improved markedly over the past decade , reflected in rising foreign investment and exports , both of which reached their highest levels ever in 2011 . 
Colombia is no longer seen as a problem country whose neighbors fear destabilization from its guerrillas and narcotics traffickers . 
Moreover , its democracy has matured , and its economy is advancing toward modernity , driven by an economic bonanza of mineral resources , mainly oil , coal , and gold . 
Colombian diplomacy is experiencing a golden era as well . 
Santos has improved relations with neighboring countries and the Andean sub-region as a whole , despite deep ideological disagreement with these countries &quot; leaders - Venezuela &apos;s Hugo Chávez , Ecuador &apos;s Rafael Correa , Bolivia &apos;s Evo Morales , and Peru &apos;s Ollanta Humala . 
Each of these leaders governs his country in the region &apos;s nationalist tradition of caudillo rule . 
They also employ an economic model that , unlike the neo-liberalism that Santos promotes , distrusts the free market and - especially in the case of Chávez and Morales - hinders free trade . 
The differences extend to other vital questions as well , such as their conception of democracy and their relations with the United States . 
Colombia maintains close ties with the US , which has provided $ 6 billion in aid over the past ten years - almost all of it coming in the form of military assistance - to strengthen the government &apos;s ability to confront the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia ( FARC , Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) and drug traffickers . 
Moreover , the two countries have just ratified a free-trade agreement . 
By contrast , for Chávez and , to a lesser degree , other Andean leaders ( Peru being a notable exception ) , the behemoth to the north is a dangerous imperialist enemy . 
Santos &apos;s predecessor , Álvaro Uribe , endured tensions with Venezuela and Ecuador because of their alleged support for the FARC , a Marxist-Leninist guerilla insurgency that funds itself largely through drug trafficking . 
Colombia &apos;s diplomatic relations with both countries were suspended , and Chávez &apos;s support of the FARC , which suffered its worst military defeats during Uribe &apos;s eight years as President , brought the country to the brink of war with Venezuela . 
But , in August 2010 , just days after taking office , Santos abandoned Uribe &apos;s confrontational attitude and worked to normalize relations with Colombia &apos;s neighbors . 
He prepared an agenda of cooperation on multiple issues , including security as a top priority . 
Ecuador and Venezuela , interested in putting the conflict behind them , began to participate in operations against illegal groups - leftist guerrillas , right-wing paramilitary forces , and drug traffickers - that use their frontiers to elude Colombia &apos;s armed forces . 
Santos was a political ally of Uribe &apos;s , and served as Defense Minister in his administration , but , as President , he has radically transformed the country &apos;s foreign policy . 
He has set aside Uribe &apos;s overly ideological approach and combative rhetoric , instead adopting a pragmatic attitude aimed at fostering good relations with his counterparts . 
In addition , Santos has embraced a more diverse agenda , rather than focusing on security matters and military cooperation with the US , as Uribe had . 
As a result of his policies , Colombia &apos;s diplomatic stature has grown . 
The country has become a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council ; a former foreign minister , María Emma Mejía , is now Secretary General of the Union of South American Nations ; and Santos himself has visited more foreign countries and attended more multilateral forums than any Colombian leader since independence 201 years ago . 
For a year and a half , Santos &apos;s policies have been advancing in concentric circles . 
After normalizing ties with neighboring countries , he began to address regional issues , softening Uribe &apos;s radical and unpopular positions . 
Now he is seeking closer ties with regions and powers beyond the Americas . 
Colombia is currently in line to enter the OECD and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation . 
These projects will not be realized immediately . 
To succeed , Santos will need to demonstrate persistence throughout his second term , if , as expected , he is re-elected in 2014 . 
Some critics believe that Santos &apos;s intentions are too ambitious , or that they are unsustainable in the long run . 
But his results , and the domestic and foreign support that his changes have received , suggest that he is headed in the right direction . 
Indeed , one hopes that others will follow his example .
