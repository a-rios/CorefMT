Japan &apos;s Unfinished Reformation 
TOKYO - Revolutions , it is often claimed , do not happen when people are desperate . 
Perhaps this is why they so often end in disappointment . 
Expectations , usually set too high to begin with , fail to be met , resulting in anger , disillusion , and often in acts of terrifying violence . 
Japan &apos;s change of government in 2009 - when the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) broke the almost uninterrupted monopoly on power held by the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) since 1955 - was not a revolution . 
But , rather like the election of the first black president of the United States , it was fizzing with popular expectations , promising a fundamental shift from the past . 
This was even truer of Japan than the US . 
The DPJ not only put many new faces into power , it was going to change the nature of Japanese politics . 
At last , Japan would become a fully functioning democracy , and not a de facto one-party state run by bureaucrats . 
To judge from the Japanese press , as well as the DPJ &apos;s plunging poll ratings , disillusion has already set in . 
The permanent bureaucracy proved resistant , and DPJ politicians , unused to power , made mistakes . 
One of the worst was Prime Minister Naoto Kan &apos;s announcement in June of a consumption-tax hike just before the Upper House elections , which the DPJ went on to lose badly . 
The other disappointment has been the government &apos;s failure to get the US to move its Marine airbase out of Okinawa . 
This promise by the DPJ was meant to be part of Japan &apos;s new assertiveness , a first step away from being a mere &quot; aircraft carrier &quot; for the US , as a former LDP prime minister once described his country . 
If Japan &apos;s status quo is to change , the country &apos;s oddly skewed relationship with the US is one key factor . 
Japan &apos;s one-party state , under the conservative LDP , was a product of World War II and the Cold War . 
Like Italy , the old Axis partner during the war , Japan became a front-line state in the battle against Communist powers . 
And , as in Italy , a right-wing party , backed by the US , dominated politics for decades in order to crush any chance for the left to take power . 
Even former Japanese war criminals , one of whom became prime minister in the late 1950 &quot; s , became subservient allies of the US in the wars ( hot and cold ) against Communism . 
In fact , Japanese dependence on the US was even greater than that of Italy and other European powers . 
West European armies were embedded in NATO . 
Japan , whose armed forces were entirely blamed for driving the country into the catastrophic Pacific War , was not even supposed to have an army or navy after the war . 
During their occupation of Japan in the 1940 &quot; s , Americans wrote a new pacifist constitution , which made the use of Japanese military force abroad unconstitutional . 
In matters of war and peace , Japan abdicated its sovereignty . 
Most Japanese were happy to be pacifists and concentrate on making money . 
Japanese governments could devote their energy to building up the country &apos;s industrial wealth , while the US took care of security , and by extension much of Japan &apos;s foreign policy . 
It was an arrangement that suited everyone : the Japanese became rich , the Americans had a compliant anti-communist vassal state , and other Asians , even Communist China , preferred Pax Americana to a revival of Japanese military clout . 
But there was a steep political price to pay . 
A democracy that is over-dependent on an outside power , and monopolized by one party whose main role is to broker deals between big business and the bureaucracy , will become stunted and corrupt . 
Italy , under the Christian Democrats , had the same problem . 
But the end of the Cold War in Europe changed the political status quo - with mixed results , to be sure . 
Old parties lost power , which was a good thing . 
The vacuum was filled in Italy by the rise of Silvio Berlusconi , which may have been less of a good thing . 
In East Asia , by contrast , the Cold War is not yet entirely over . 
North Korea still causes trouble , and China is nominally a Communist state . 
But it is a very different world from the one left in ruins in 1945 . 
For one thing , China has become a great power , and Japan , like other Asian countries , must adapt to new circumstances . 
But , while it is the only Asian democracy able to balance the power of China , the system established after WWII is not best suited to this task . 
This was recognized by the DPJ , which would like Japan to play a more independent role , as a more equal ally , rather than a mere protectorate , of the US , and thus be a more assertive political player in Asia . 
Hence , the first symbolic step was to get the US to move its marines from Okinawa , an island that has carried the burden of a US military presence for much too long . 
The US did not see things that way . 
The DPJ threatened to change comfortable old arrangements , whereby the US could more or less tell the Japanese what to do . 
As a result , the US showed little patience with Japan on the question of Okinawa , and has barely concealed its contempt for the DPJ government , feeding popular disappointment with its performance so far . 
The US seems to prefer an obedient one-party state to a difficult , faltering , but more democratic partner in Asia . 
The Obama administration , struggling to fulfill its own promises of change , should be more understanding of its Japanese counterpart . 
If the US is as serious about promoting freedom abroad as it claims , it should not be hindering one of its closest ally &apos;s efforts to strengthen its democracy .
