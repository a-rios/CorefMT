Keeping Europe &apos;s Eastern Promise 
KYIV - For many years , the European Union &apos;s eastward expansion seemed unstoppable . 
But with Russia &apos;s invasion of Ukraine , President Vladimir Putin appears to have succeeded in ordering a halt to Europe &apos;s efforts to extend democracy , the rule of law , and open markets throughout the continent . 
The EU must not kowtow to his demands . 
Ukraine &apos;s fate has become Europe &apos;s fate . 
Indeed , Putin not only wants to stop European political , civic , and social norms from taking root within Ukraine ; he wants to roll them back in the Baltics , the Balkans , and anywhere else in Europe made politically brittle by economic crisis and / or demagogic populism . 
The EU Eastern Partnership summit in Riga can and must demonstrate Europe &apos;s determination to defend its unity , security , and values in the face of Russian aggression . 
And it must do so in concrete ways , not simply with quickly forgotten official communiqu√©s for which the Kremlin and its Ukrainian separatist proxies have only contempt . 
Of paramount importance is to make the new policy a true partnership among peoples . 
The citizens of the partner countries must become the real beneficiaries if this partnership is to become more than the inert agreement that it has been . 
Generous EU commitments on mobility , aid to SMEs and entrepreneurs , and a vast increase in educational opportunities are among the key ingredients that could make such a partnership politically popular for a vast majority . 
Ukraine should be the centerpiece of any effort to revive the Eastern Partnership as a way to attract the support of Europeans who remain outside the EU . 
Yes , the news from my country remains bad . 
Thousands of our citizens are dead . 
Hundreds of thousands are now refugees in their own homeland . 
The Minsk II cease-fire agreement has failed to restrain Russian / separatist forces . 
Although Ukraine &apos;s economy is no longer in free-fall , as it was last winter , GDP has declined by a quarter since Russian troops first invaded in February 2014 . 
Official unemployment now stands at over 10 % , compared to 7.3 % before Russia &apos;s occupation and annexation of Crimea . 
Our national debt is mounting by the day to levels that inspired The Economist to suggest that we may become the &quot; Greece of the east . &quot; 
Moreover , much of our economy remains in separatist hands , and they , no surprise , are running the stolen assets into the ground . 
In the face of such calamitous conditions , Ukraine &apos;s government is a bit like the proverbial Dutch boy who put his finger in a dike to stop the sea from leaking through . 
Despite herculean efforts , more leaks continue to appear . 
The simple truth that Europe must grasp is that we Ukrainians simply do not have enough fingers to plug all the leaks , and thus rebuild our economy , on our own . 
Despite the depth of Ukraine &apos;s plight , Europe cannot avoid taking up the challenge that Putin has set before it . 
After all , if Putin succeeds in turning Ukraine into a failed state with a frozen conflict embedded within it , he will seek the same outcome all along the EU &apos;s borders , from Estonia to Greece . 
Fortunately , the EU has a real partner in Ukraine , whose people &apos;s devotion to Europe has been tested by snipers in the streets of Kyiv and now by the Russian army . 
Their courage , and their newfound political activism , has stiffened the government &apos;s backbone in implementing needed reforms and made it impossible for any political actor in Ukraine to buck the pro-EU consensus . 
The EU can stiffen it even more by demanding much greater clarity in the fight against corruption . 
Yet , given the war in the eastern Donbas region , the shattering of so much of our economy , and the precarious nature of our government &apos;s finances , the International Monetary Fund and others are clearly asking too much of Ukrainians . 
The idea that Ukraine can embrace the economic &quot; shock therapy &quot; that Poland pursued a quarter-century ago is the type of cookie-cutter policymaking that resulted in the 2008 global financial crisis . 
That is why the Eastern Partnership , if it is to be renewed , must embrace bold new initiatives for Ukraine , and not try to reheat old policies designed for very different circumstances . 
A recent report from the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies provides some guidance concerning what the EU should now try to do for Ukraine . 
For starters , the EU should help us create a more stable exchange-rate regime to overcome the currency volatility that has wracked our economy since Russia &apos;s invasion . 
And , although fiscal consolidation is necessary , given the state of our economy , Ukraine &apos;s most vulnerable people are now enduring a hand-to-mouth existence . 
They have nothing more to sacrifice . 
On the contrary , they need relief , and Europe should insist that its programs , and those of the IMF , take their needs into account . 
Perhaps most important for the long term , the EU must honor its commitment to the deep free-trade and association agreement that Ukraine &apos;s previous government refused to sign in late 2013 . 
After all , it was to secure that agreement that young Ukrainians braved former President Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s snipers , and are now braving the might of the Russian army . 
To follow through would do more to anchor Ukrainians &quot; confidence in their European future , and to convince the Kremlin that it cannot succeed in rolling back European values , than anything else the EU might do . 
One clear way that Europe can demonstrate that its association agreement with Ukraine remains alive is to encourage investment in my country . 
Since Russia &apos;s invasion , FDI into Ukraine has collapsed , which is precisely what Putin wants . 
The EU can demonstrate its commitment to Ukraine &apos;s economic renewal by having the European Investment Bank invest in a showcase infrastructure project , say improved rail links to the EU . 
The EU faces a stark choice : a renewed Eastern Partnership or a renewed division of Europe . 
The decisions that it makes , beginning at the Riga summit , will determine Europe &apos;s fate for decades to come .
