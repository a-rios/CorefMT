Racial Medicine \ u0027s Revival 
It wasn &apos;t supposed to be this way . 
In the spring of 2000 , Francis Collins and Craig Venter announced at a White House news conference the completion of &quot; the first draft &quot; of the mapping and sequencing of the human DNA . 
With President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair nodding their approval , Collins and Venter agreed that racial classifications make no sense at the molecular level ; we humans are 99.9 % alike in our DNA . 
News media around the world picked up the story , intrigued by science &apos;s definitive refutation of racial thinking . 
Not so fast . 
While we may all be 99.9 % alike , there are three billion base pairs of human DNA , which leaves at least three million points of difference ( single nucleotide polymorphisms , or SNP &apos;s ) between any two people . 
Armed with the promise of powerful new computer-driven technology , scientific attention is becoming riveted to that remaining 0.1 % of genetic difference . 
Why has science turned - after only a few years - from repudiating the existence of racial differences between human beings to generating a near obsession with them ? 
Around the same time that the first draft of the human genome was being completed , IBM announced the development of a new Super Computer capable of performing 7.3 trillion calculations per second on human DNA . 
The original idea was that greater computing capacity would enable particularized therapies , because we could now turn our attention to individual differences in everything from gene therapy to the delivery of pharmaceuticals . 
But gene therapy has run up against a brick wall . 
An experiment at the University of Pennsylvania resulted in the death of the patient , Jesse Gelsinger , in late 1999 . 
Then another gene therapy experiment in France generated leukemia in several patients - and the protocols were stopped immediately . 
So the blind alley of gene therapy has sent biotechnology heading full throttle down the road of drug development , based on the new genomics . 
Here , researchers are keen to exploit national , ethnic , and racial bio-databanks . 
A breakthrough came in December 1998 , when Iceland &apos;s parliament approved a bill giving a private biotechnology company legal access to a comprehensive genetic database - the first of its kind - for the country &apos;s entire population of 270,000 . 
Iceland has kept medical data on its population for more than a century , including records of the deceased . 
By combining both stored and newly collected blood and tissue samples , and supplementing these with detailed genealogical charts and records , the biotechnology company believes that it has gained a head start in searching for genes that are implicated in human disease . 
What is worrisome , however , is the putative &quot; ethnic purity &quot; of the database . 
According to the magazine Science , Iceland &apos;s &quot; isolated position &quot; and catastrophes that &quot; wiped out large parts of &#91; its &#93; population &quot; have left it with &quot; a remarkably homogenic gene pool . &quot; 
This makes it &quot; relatively easy to track down disease-causing mutations that might form the basis for new tests and therapies . &quot; 
Here was the foot in the door , the first step toward conceptualizing strategies of research and then delivery of drugs to populations that are defined by ethnicity and race . 
The next step was not long in coming . 
In March 2001 , the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) allowed the biotech firm NitroMed to proceed with a full-scale clinical trial of what has been touted as &quot; the first ethnic drug . &quot; 
The trial itself was the first ever &quot; conducted exclusively in black men and women suffering from heart failure . &quot; 
The drug , BiDil , is designed to treat or prevent congestive heart failure by raising low or depleted levels of nitric oxide in the blood . 
It was originally designed for a wide population base , and race was irrelevant . 
But early clinical studies revealed no compelling results , and an FDA advisory panel voted 9 to 3 against the drug &apos;s approval . 
However , BiDil was suddenly born again as a racialized remedy . 
This is all the more remarkable because , by concentrating only on blacks , the clinical trials now under way can have little or nothing compelling to say about comparative results according to supposed racial differences between humans . 
Moreover , the underlying epidemiological mistake of such &quot; racial medicine &quot; is obvious . 
As Michael Klag and his colleagues showed a decade ago , in general , the darker one &apos;s skin color , the higher the rate of hypertension for American blacks , even within the African American community . 
The differences were not biological or genetic in origin , but biological in effect due to stress-related outcomes of darker skin color : reduced access to valued social goods such as employment , promotion , housing , etc . 
Unfortunately , while the new mantra of biotechnology is to claim that someday soon pharmaceuticals will be marketed to individuals based on their DNA , the fundamental truth is that selling drugs is still a mass-market business . 
Target markets consist of groups and population aggregates , not individuals . 
So , for the pharmaceutical industry , racial categorizations make economic sense . 
It has always been difficult to use the market to battle racial discrimination , and many governments nowadays behave as though they would prefer to give up the fight . 
But racialized drugs ? 
They may be coming soon , accompanied by the retrograde racial thinking - with its full range of dangerous assumptions and historical associations - that molecular biology was supposed to have dispelled .
