Europe &apos;s Fight Against Terrorism 
Three years ago this month , international terrorism struck Europe . 
In simultaneous bomb attacks on trains in Madrid , Islamist terrorists killed 191 people and wounded over 2,000 . 
Last month the suspects went on trial in a Spanish court . 
Violent extremists claiming to act in the name of Islam have hit many countries around the world , before and after the attacks on America of September 11 , 2001 . 
But the attacks in Madrid - and in London in July 2005 - showed that Europe is one of their prime targets , prompting European governments to respond by bolstering their defenses , including at the level of the European Union . 
In the past three years , security standards at European ports and airports have been strengthened , biometric passports have been introduced , and terrorist financing targeted . 
More than 2,000 terrorism suspects and those suspected of other major forms of crime have been arrested and extradited on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant . 
Similarly , European security and intelligence services have pooled resources in a common center for threat analysis in Brussels . 
Through Europol and Eurojust , European police forces and judicial authorities have intensified cooperation , and ministers are preparing to grant law enforcement agencies of other EU countries access to national databases of DNA and fingerprints . 
For the first time , security-related research figures prominently in the EU budget , with â‚¬ 1.4 billion earmarked for this purpose . 
European police and security agencies have prevented many terrorist attacks . 
But , while Europe &apos;s defenses have been considerably strengthened , the threat of terrorism has not diminished . 
The risk of new attacks in Europe and worldwide is serious and will remain so for the foreseeable future . 
To face this global threat , international cooperation must be improved . 
In particular , Muslims and non-Muslims need to combine their efforts to defend the sanctity of human life . 
First , the world must work from common standards . 
Many countries still need to improve their defenses and implement the 16 counter-terrorism instruments established by the United Nations , including the convention against terrorist financing . 
Reducing the risk of terrorists obtaining weapons of mass destruction equally requires stronger international cooperation . 
To this end , the EU is working closely with its partners , from Morocco and Indonesia to Saudi-Arabia and other Gulf states . 
The EU will extend support to the African Union &apos;s Center for Counter-Terrorism in Algiers . 
Cooperation with India , Pakistan , and Russia has also been strengthened , and the Union will continue to work closely with the US , Japan , and Australia . 
Second , more must be done to address the international conflicts that terrorists seek to exploit . 
Afghanistan remains a critical front-line state in the fight against terrorism . 
The Taliban must not be allowed to bomb Afghanistan back in time . 
The EU will increase its aid , notably in support of the Afghan police . 
Likewise , efforts to bring peace to the Middle East remain essential . 
While progress on the road to peace between Israel and the Palestinians would not by itself stop terrorism , it would deal a powerful blow to terrorist incitement and propaganda . 
Javier Solana , the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy , will continue to press for results . 
Third , we must counter the ideology of the terrorists . 
Very few Muslims want to live under a seventh century-style caliphate . 
They prefer to live in freedom and in parliamentary democracies . 
What unites Muslims and non-Muslims is a commitment to basic human rights . 
To respect and promote human rights is critical to winning the battle for hearts and minds , including in Europe . 
This means that governments need to practice what they preach . 
Detention without trial is counterproductive in the fight against terrorism . 
So is torture . 
To defeat the terrorists we must offer a vision of a more just and equitable world and act accordingly , at home and abroad . 
Ultimately , the values of liberty and justice are our best defense .
