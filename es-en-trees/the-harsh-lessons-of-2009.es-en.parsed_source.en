The Harsh Lessons of 2009 
NEW YORK - The best that can be said for 2009 is that it could have been worse , that we pulled back from the precipice on which we seemed to be perched in late 2008 , and that 2010 will almost surely be better for most countries around the world . 
The world has also learned some valuable lessons , though at great cost to both current and future prosperity - costs that were unnecessarily high given that we should already have learned them . 
The first lesson is that markets are not self-correcting . 
Indeed , without adequate regulation , they are prone to excess . 
In 2009 , we again see why Adam Smith &apos;s invisible hand often appears invisible : it is not there . 
The bankers &quot; pursuit of self-interest ( greed ) did not lead to the well-being of society ; it did not even serve their shareholders and bondholders well . 
It certainly did not serve homeowners who are losing their homes , workers who have lost their jobs , retirees who have seen their retirement funds vanish , or taxpayers who paid hundreds of billions to bail out the banks . 
Under the threat of a collapse of the entire system , the safety net- intended to help unfortunate individuals meet the exigencies of life - was generously extended to commercial banks , then to investment banks , insurance firms , auto companies , even car-loan companies . 
Never has so much money been transferred from so many to so few . 
We are accustomed to thinking of government transferring money from the well off to the poor . 
Here it was the poor and average transferring money to the rich . 
Already heavily burdened taxpayers saw their money - intended to help banks lend so that the economy could be revived - go to pay outsized bonuses and dividends . 
Dividends are supposed to be a share of profits ; here it was simply a share of government largesse . 
The justification was that bailing out the banks , however messily , would enable a resumption of lending . 
That has not happened . 
All that happened was that average taxpayers gave money to the very institutions that had been gouging them for years - through predatory lending , usurious credit-card interest rates , and non-transparent fees . 
The bailout exposed deep hypocrisy all around . 
Those who had preached fiscal restraint when it came to small welfare programs for the poor now clamored for the world &apos;s largest welfare program . 
Those who had argued for the free market &apos;s virtue of &quot; transparency &quot; ended up creating financial systems so opaque that banks could not make sense of their own balance sheets . 
And then the government , too , was induced to engage in decreasingly transparent forms of bailout to cover up its largesse to the banks . 
Those who had argued for &quot; accountability &quot; and &quot; responsibility &quot; now sought debt forgiveness for the financial sector . 
The second important lesson involves understanding why markets often do not work the way they are meant to work . 
There are many reasons for market failures . 
In this case , too-big-to-fail financial institutions had perverse incentives : if they gambled and succeeded , they walked off with the profits ; if they lost , the taxpayer would pay . 
Moreover , when information is imperfect , markets often do not work well - and information imperfections are central in finance . 
Externalities are pervasive : the failure of one bank imposed costs on others , and failures in the financial system imposed costs on taxpayers and workers all over the world . 
The third lesson is that Keynesian policies do work . 
Those countries , like Australia , that implemented large , well designed stimulus programs early emerged from the crisis faster . 
Other countries succumbed to the old orthodoxy pushed by the financial wizards who got us into this mess . 
Whenever an economy goes into recession , deficits appear , as tax revenues fall faster than expenditures . 
The old orthodoxy held that one had to cut the deficit - raise taxes or cut expenditures - to &quot; restore confidence . &quot; 
The fourth lesson is that there is more to monetary policy than just fighting inflation . 
Excessive focus on inflation meant that some central banks ignored what was happening to their financial markets . 
The costs of mild inflation are miniscule compared to the costs imposed on economies when central banks allow asset bubbles to grow unchecked . 
The fifth lesson is that not all innovation leads to a more efficient and productive economy - let alone a better society . 
Private incentives matter , and if they are not well aligned with social returns , the result can be excessive risk taking , excessively short-sighted behavior , and distorted innovation . 
For example , while the benefits of many of the financial-engineering innovations of recent years are hard to prove , let alone quantify , the costs associated with them - both economic and social - are apparent and enormous . 
Indeed , financial engineering did not create products that would help ordinary citizens manage the simple risk of home ownership - with the consequence that millions have lost their homes , and millions more are likely to do so . 
Instead , innovation was directed at perfecting the exploitation of those who are less educated , and at circumventing the regulations and accounting standards that were designed to make markets more efficient and stable . 
As a result , financial markets , which are supposed to manage risk and allocate capital efficiently , created risk and misallocated wildly . 
We will soon find out whether we have learned the lessons of this crisis any better than we should have learned the same lessons from previous crises . 
Regrettably , unless the United States and other advanced industrial countries make much greater progress on financial-sector reforms in 2010 , we may find ourselves faced with another opportunity to learn them .
