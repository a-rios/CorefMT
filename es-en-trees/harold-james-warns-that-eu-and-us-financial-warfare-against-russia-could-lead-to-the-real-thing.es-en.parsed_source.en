The West &apos;s Financial Arsenal 
PRINCETON - The revolution in Ukraine and Russia &apos;s illegal annexation of Crimea have generated a serious security crisis in Europe . 
But , with Western leaders testing a new kind of financial warfare , the situation could become even more dangerous . 
A democratic , stable , and prosperous Ukraine would be a constant irritant - and rebuke - to President Vladimir Putin &apos;s autocratic and economically sclerotic Russian Federation . 
In order to prevent such an outcome , Putin is trying to destabilize Ukraine , by seizing Crimea and fomenting ethnic conflict in the eastern part of the country . 
At the same time , Putin is attempting to boost Russia &apos;s appeal by doubling Crimeans &quot; pensions , boosting the salaries of the region &apos;s 200,000 civil servants , and constructing large , Sochi-style infrastructure , including a $ 3 billion bridge across the Kerch Strait . 
This strategy &apos;s long-term sustainability is dubious , owing to the strain that it will put on Russia &apos;s public finances . 
But it will nonetheless serve Putin &apos;s goal of projecting Russia &apos;s influence . 
For their part , the European Union and the United States have no desire for military intervention to defend Ukraine &apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity . 
But verbal protests alone would make the West look ridiculous and ineffective to the rest of the international community , ultimately giving rise to further - and increasingly far-ranging - security challenges . 
This leaves Western powers with one option : to launch a financial war against Russia . 
As the former US Treasury official Juan Zarate revealed in his recent memoir Treasury &apos;s War , the US spent the decade after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks developing a new set of financial weapons to use against America &apos;s enemies - first Al Qaeda , then North Korea and Iran , and now Russia . 
These weapons included asset freezes and blocking rogue banks &quot; access to international finance . 
When the Ukrainian revolution began , the Russian banking system was already over-extended and vulnerable . 
But the situation became much worse with the toppling of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the annexation of Crimea , which triggered a stock-market panic that weakened the Russian economy considerably and depleted the assets of Russia &apos;s powerful oligarchs . 
In a crony capitalist system , threatening the governing elite &apos;s wealth rapidly erodes loyalty to the regime . 
For the corrupt elite , there is a tipping point beyond which the opposition provides better protection for their wealth and power - a point that was reached in Ukraine as the Maidan protests gathered momentum . 
Putin &apos;s public speeches reveal his conviction that the EU and the US cannot possibly be serious about their financial war , which , in his view , would ultimately hurt their highly complex and interconnected financial markets more than Russia &apos;s relatively isolated financial system . 
After all , the link between financial integration and vulnerability was the main lesson of the crisis that followed the US investment bank Lehman Brothers &quot; collapse in 2008 . 
In fact , Lehman was a small institution compared to the Austrian , French , and German banks that have become highly exposed to Russia &apos;s financial system through the practice of using deposits from Russian companies and individuals to lend to Russian borrowers . 
Given this , a Russian asset freeze could be catastrophic for European - indeed , global - financial markets . 
Putin &apos;s plan for destabilizing Ukraine is thus two-pronged : capitalize on linguistic or national animosities in Ukraine to foster social fragmentation , while taking advantage of Western - especially European - financial vulnerabilities . 
Indeed , Putin sometimes likes to frame it as a contest pitting him against the power of financial markets . 
The arms race that preceded World War I was accompanied by exactly the same mixture of military reluctance and eagerness to experiment with the power of markets . 
In 1911 , the leading textbook on the German financial system , by the veteran banker Jacob Riesser , warned that , &quot; The enemy , however , may endeavor to aggravate a panic &amp; hellip ; by the sudden collection of outstanding claims , by an unlimited sale of our home securities , and by other attempts to deprive Germany of gold . 
Attempts may also be made to dislocate our capital , bill , and securities markets , and to menace the basis of our system of credit and payments . &quot; 
Politicians began to grasp the potential consequences of financial vulnerability only in 1907 , when they faced a financial panic that originated in the US but that had serious consequences for continental Europe ( and , in some ways , prefigured the Great Depression ) . 
That experience taught every country to make its own financial system more resilient to ward off potential attacks , and that attacks could be a devastating response to diplomatic pressure . 
That is exactly what happened in 1911 , when a dispute over control of Morocco spurred France to organize the withdrawal of DM200 million invested in Germany . 
But Germany was prepared and managed to ward off the attack . 
Indeed , German bankers proudly noted that the crisis of confidence hit the Paris market much harder than markets in Berlin or Hamburg . 
Countries &quot; efforts to protect their financial systems often centered on increased banking supervision and , in many cases , enlarging the central bank &apos;s authority to include the provision of emergency liquidity to domestic institutions . 
Subsequent debates about financial reform in the US reflected this imperative , with some of the US Federal Reserve &apos;s founders pointing out the military and financial applications of the term &quot; reserve . &quot; 
At that time , financial-reform efforts were driven by the notion that building up financial buffers would make the world safe . 
But this belief fueled excessive confidence among those responsible for the reforms , preventing them from anticipating that military measures would soon be needed to protect the economy . 
Instead of being an alternative to war , the financial arms race made war more likely - as it may well be doing with Russia today .
