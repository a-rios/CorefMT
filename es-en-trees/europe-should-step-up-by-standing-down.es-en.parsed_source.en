Europe Should Step Up By Standing Down 
LONDON - Ten years on , the euro is a resounding success . 
A financial-market heavyweight , it now outperforms the dollar , the yen , and , until recently , the mighty Chinese yuan , while euro-denominated bond trading rivals the US market in size . 
But Europe should be doing better . 
It should act with greater imagination to unleash more genuine economic freedom and competition , stop championing national enterprises , and start giving the European Central Bank more support . 
Euro-zone policymakers should also seize the initiative in the world &apos;s key economic clubs . 
In particular , members of Europe &apos;s economic and monetary union should give up their seats in the G-7 and the International Monetary Fund . 
There may be some justification for each EMU state to be represented in the G-8 , but not in the main economic organizations . 
If they volunteered to act collectively at these forums , Europe would free up much-needed space for other important countries at the top table of world economic discussions , which would foster greater respect for global policymakers . 
Internally , euro-zone &quot; success &quot; can best be measured by the yardstick of economic growth . 
Many commentators cite the wide disparities between euro-zone members &quot; growth rates as a sign of failure . 
It should also be obvious that , in the absence of currency markets to act as a &quot; valve &quot; for economic and financial pressures , economic volatility may increase . 
In fact , euro-zone leaders should be less worried about variations in internal growth than about clear evidence of overall economic underperformance . 
While growth has been reasonably stable since EMU started , per capita GDP - probably the best measure of economic success available - shows that Europe has lagged other regions , even when the figures are adjusted for workforce size . 
It is also well known that European productivity is falling behind , too , probably due to the same factors that make Europe seem dull , cautious , and lacking in ambition when compared with many of its competitors . 
When it comes to internal competition policies , most European countries still think within the national &quot; box . &quot; 
For the euro to help lift European growth and productivity in any significant way , governments must allow - indeed , encourage - stronger competitive forces across the EMU area . 
In terms of external economic policy , European policymakers have done very little in response to the wholesale changes now underway in the world economy - beyond complaining about Chinese imports and Russia &apos;s aggressive use of its commodities , and , most recently , becoming embarrassingly obsessed with so-called Sovereign Wealth Funds . 
This is a poor showing for countries that successfully confronted the challenges of creating the EU and monetary union . 
After all the diplomacy and effort that these epoch-making events required , European policymakers should be able to tackle reform of the IMF , the World Bank , the G-7 , and the G-8 . 
Yet all of these institutions still reflect the post-World War II status quo , which serves little purpose in today &apos;s world . 
For example , why is there an international economic organization such as the G-7 without China , which is poised to overtake Germany as the world &apos;s third largest economy and since 2000 has contributed almost as much to global economic activity as the entire euro zone ? 
Most global economic issues today cannot be solved without policy steps in China . 
Indeed , how can the G-7 have the audacity to make repeated public comments about the currency of an outside country and hope for a positive response ? 
It is almost farcical . 
Meanwhile , France , Germany , and Italy are all in the G-7 , even though they share the same monetary policy and currency . 
It would be better if the ECB and the EU finance ministers adopted a common position ahead of G-7 meetings , then allowed their joint view to be represented by a single Council representative and the ECB &apos;s president . 
Because ministers meet before each G-7 meeting , this would be an easy procedure to introduce . 
Indeed , a &quot; financial G-6 &quot; may today make more sense than the current G-7 , but that may no longer hold true tomorrow . 
In another 10 years , India may be in the top echelon of economic powers . 
Can Canada keep its place while Russia and Brazil are excluded ? 
And what other economic giants are waiting in the wings ? 
Clearly , therefore , we need to devise a system of membership for key international organizations that ensures that their structures are relevant but that is also flexible enough to allow members to come and go . 
One way forward would be to establish numerical guidelines - along the lines of the Maastricht Treaty - for conferring G-7 membership . 
Europe should lead by example - offering the world the benefit of its deep experience of financial diplomacy and volunteering to take the first steps forward . 
Given that Europe managed to construct EMU , the Maastricht Treaty , and the stability and growth pact that underlines the euro , it should be relatively easy for euro-zone experts to help devise a system for judging G-7 type membership . 
Unless European countries take the initiative on global financial institutional reform , it will remain a lost cause .
