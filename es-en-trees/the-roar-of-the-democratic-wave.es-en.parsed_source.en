The Roar of the Democratic Wave 
PARIS - Has the uprising in Tunisia sparked a new democratic wave that will conquer Egypt and eventually sweep away the authoritarian &quot; Arab exception &quot; ? 
After southern Europe in the 1970 &quot; s , Latin America in the late 1980 &quot; s , and Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990 &quot; s , it seems that now it is the Mediterranean region &apos;s turn . 
For Europe , democratization immediately to its south is a vital interest . 
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali &apos;s ouster in Tunisia signalled the collapse of the Arab &quot; stability &quot; model , praised by many Western leaders , consisting of authoritarianism and overrated economic performance . 
The surge of anger and revolt in Egypt , whatever its final outcome , marks the beginning of the end for authoritarian nationalist Arab regimes . 
In contrast to Tunisia , the military is a pillar of the Egyptian regime . 
But it is unlikely that Egypt &apos;s huge ( mostly conscript ) army will engage in massive , violent repression , which would be unprecedented in that country . 
Even if President Hosni Mubarak hangs on to complete the remainder of his term , the ruling National Democratic Party &apos;s regime , its legitimacy irreparably shaken , will not survive for long . 
Omar Suleiman &apos;s appointment as Vice-President ( and heir-apparent ) indicates that the army has accepted that Mubarak must leave sooner or later . 
Nor , it seems clear , will Mubarak secure the succession of his son , Gamel , before he goes . 
The regime &apos;s international legitimacy is equally in a shambles . 
The United States , Egypt &apos;s main ally , while stopping short of siding with the protesters , is holding the regime to Mubarak &apos;s promise of a &quot; better democracy , &quot; and demanding swift action to meet the people &apos;s legitimate demands . 
By hinting strongly that its $ 1.5 billion in largely military aid would be withheld in the event of unacceptable levels of repression , the US revealed that the post-Mubarak era is already being contemplated . 
The US - and Europe - are keen to avoid a sudden collapse of the Egyptian regime . 
But a protracted and incremental process of small steps towards economic and then political reform - the sequence contemplated by the European Union - is no longer an option . 
The regime is past reforming , and must give way to a new democratic republic , with a new constitution . 
Ideally , this should come about in a manner similar to democratic transitions in Latin America in the 1980 &quot; s , when authoritarian , army-backed rulers yielded to popular demands for radical , democratic regime change . 
Resorting to thugs to carry out widespread intimidation , and blaming violence on the largely peaceful protests of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Egyptians , as their government has done , is not a good omen . 
Unlike in Tunisia , Europeans and Americans should increase the pressure on Egypt &apos;s leaders - primarily the military at this stage - to start fulfilling the regime &apos;s promises of political reform . 
This will lack credibility under Mubarak , whose refusal to stand down is a recipe for chaos . 
It is necessary that the international community : 
· Withdraw support for Mubarak ; 
· Support the formation of a transitional authority , supported by the military and the &quot; street , &quot; and including independent political figures untainted by the regime , to prepare free and fair elections ; 
· Call for an amnesty for all political prisoners . 
Many of the conditions needed for a democratic transformation - a vibrant and organized civil society , a relatively free press , and well-respected opposition figures , as well as a variety of battered but breathing political parties of different persuasions - are already present . 
Fear of the Muslim Brotherhood , which is only marginally involved in an uprising that it did not initiate and has no hope of controlling , is no excuse for trying to save a failing regime . 
The tragic consequences of eleventh-hour attempts to save the Shah in Iran should not be forgotten . 
There is also no reason to believe ( contrary to the regime &apos;s insistence ) that the Brotherhood would emerge victorious from a democratic transition . 
Of course , there are concerns about the future of Egypt &apos;s foreign policy , especially toward Israel . 
But there is no indication that a non-authoritarian Egyptian regime would call into question the bilateral peace treaty , though a definite end to the Gaza blockade and a shift in attitude towards Hamas - in the sense of a more serious attempt at forging Palestinian unity - are to be expected . 
For Europe , the best option is to support the mass movement calling for regime change led by Mohammed ElBaradei , the Nobel laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency . 
The joint declaration by German Chancellor Angela Merkel , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , and British Prime Minister David Cameron , calling for a &quot; broad-based government &quot; and &quot; free and fair elections &quot; in Egypt stands in stark contrast to the embarrassed silence that was heard at the outset of Tunisia &apos;s democratic uprising . 
It is still too soon , however , to conclude that Europeans have finally overcome their fear of Arab democracy and will not be tempted to accept milder forms of &quot; liberal authoritarianism &quot; should the crisis drag on or a military takeover occur . 
That would be a grave mistake , for such an outcome would most likely pave the way for extreme alternatives . 
Europe and the US must be as supportive of democracy in the Mediterranean region as they are within Europe itself . 
When tides are turning , people will remember who stood with them and who did not . 
As it did during Ukraine &apos;s Orange Revolution in 2004 , Europe needs to show that it stands for democracy , not merely for stability .
