Winning at Corporate Governance 
CAMBRIDGE : Despite NASDAQ crashes and the threat of US recession , the New Economy is here to stay . 
Indeed , it remains the key to improved performance in Europe and Japan in the years ahead . 
But where , exactly , does the heart of the New economy lie ? 
Is it in more competitive labor markets or in better tax systems or in deregulation ? 
Corporate governance , too , is a motor of the New Economy that should not be underrated . 
If managers create productive , flexible structures focused on wealth creation , companies find it easy to adjust and explore new sources of productivity and cost control . 
If decentralization and risk taking are part of a company &apos;s mission , innovation in products and processes is certain to take place . 
If , on the contrary , bosses behave like cautious executors of a wealthy estate , their companies will soon look like museums . 
A country &apos;s economic performance , indeed , is a mirror image of its resident companies . 
Countries with great companies show great performance . 
Where then are the great companies of the world to be found ? 
No surprise that more than half of the most respected companies are American . 
Although Europe is roughly the same economic size as the US , it has far fewer winning corporate teams . 
Japan may be much smaller than America or Europe , but it underperforms its share of G7 income or wealth . 
The picture could not be clearer : the US economy performs stunningly , as does its corporate sector ; 
Europe is far behind ; and Japan does not really register . 
Peering into the future of this premier league of companies five years from now , the FT sees a number of shifts as likely , with Europe catching up , Japan losing even more ground , and America giving up some ground , too . 
This glimpse into the future mirrors today &apos;s perceptions of a maturing ( a code-word for losing its edge ) American economy and a Europe able to play catch-up because the new business culture is at last taking hold . 
This survey also accurately reflects the reality that very few Japanese firms are succeeding at the hard task of restructuring , of shifting to modern , world-class governance . 
World-class Sony stays ahead ; 
The dynamics of the next 5 years will also reflect a head-on competition between winning corporations . 
Boeing versus Airbus may be the most interesting example . 
In the current rankings , both are locked in a clinch close to the bottom of the FT list of top firms . 
In 5 years , however , Airbus will likely be up and Boeing out of the champions league altogether . 
Why ? 
Airbus has looked ahead , invested , and is bringing on a new Jumbo jet that will make Boeing &apos;s existing products look outdated and inefficient . 
For Boeing became complacent and forgot that the airline business is a cut-throat world . 
When thinking about economic potential , we tend to look at the quality of the labor force , a people &apos;s willingness to work , and the level of education . 
Seen from this perspective , Europe and Japan should trounce the US because of their far superior basic education systems , and Japanese discipline make Europeans look lazy . 
In fact , effort and education are not what matters most . 
Far more significant is the economic environment in which people work - a market economy versus some form of socialism - and the organization of businesses in which they participate . 
The best model of corporate governance to produce strong and lasting economic performance remains to be found . 
In the 1980s , respect for the long-run view of the Japanese model ran high . 
This is no longer so because of Japan &apos;s economic malaise . 
Then there was the flirtation with the German model of business-banking integration , which brings capital markets in-house . 
That lost its attraction when it became clear that cozy relations between bankers and bosses result in tolerance for poor rates of return on capital . 
Now the US model is in : decentralized , lean on middle management , tough on the CEO ; and with a &quot; don &apos;t take no for an answer &quot; code . 
But this won &apos;t be the last answer , although for the time being it will drive corporate restructuring and the managerial mind . 
All this begs the question as to whether it makes sense to change corporate cultures every 10 or 20 years . 
The pragmatic answer is that it takes very different models to handle a stable and stationary world as opposed to a world in which deregulation and technology produce dramatic change daily . 
The US model works in times of rapid , pervasive change . 
This is what lies ahead for the foreseeable future .
