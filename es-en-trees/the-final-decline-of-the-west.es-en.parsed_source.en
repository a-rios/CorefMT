The Final Decline of the West 
PARIS - In 2040 / 2050 , will demographers speak of &quot; the white man &apos;s loneliness &quot; in the way historians once referred to &quot; the white man &apos;s burden &quot; to describe the so-called &quot; imperial responsibilities &quot; of some European nations ? 
Demography is not an exact science . 
Countless dire predictions , from that of Malthus to that of the Club of Rome , have been proven wrong . 
The Western world will represent only 12 % of the world &apos;s population , with Europeans reduced to 6 % . 
( In 1913 , a year before the outbreak of World War I , Europe was slightly more populated than China . ) 
What we are witnessing can be seen is a return to the past , with the West returning to its old place in the world before the start of China &apos;s long process of historical decline at the beginning of the nineteenth century . 
We are entering a new historical cycle , in which there will be proportionally fewer Westerners , more Africans and Middle Easterners , and - with greater relevance economically and strategically - many more Asians . 
It is with these figures in mind that one must consider Barack Obama &apos;s decision not to attend the next European-American summit that was due to take place in Madrid in May . 
It would be tempting to use a formula coined during the Cold War to describe the comparative evolution of the United States and the Soviet Union and to apply the notion of &quot; competitive decline &quot; to the relationship between the US and Europe . 
An America that may be undergoing a process of relative if not absolute decline chooses to ignore a Europe that in US eyes is no longer a problem compared with Asia or the Middle East , and that offers little help in finding solutions to the problems that most vex Americans . 
In a hasty and excessively provocative manner , some in the American media are starting to speak of Obama as &quot; a second Jimmy Carter &quot; and predict that he will serve only one term . 
What is more serious is the impression that the American political system , with its inability to transcend party divisions and forge national consensus , is increasingly sclerotic . 
America &apos;s political institutions have aged like the country &apos;s infrastructure . 
They were devised more than two centuries ago for a mostly agrarian world . 
Today , they need to be amended and rejuvenated . 
As for the European Union , the problem is not what will not happen in Madrid . 
The EU &apos;s problem is much more what happened in Copenhagen last December at the summit to &quot; save the planet , &quot; or what is taking place before our eyes with the challenge to the euro posed by the weakness of some of its member states , most prominently Greece . 
In Copenhagen , Europe came with a common and responsible position . 
The EU was &quot; showing the way &quot; to other great actors and behaved as the &quot; good pupil &quot; of the world class . 
The Union was ignored , with the US and China choosing to disagree over its head . 
Europe must realize that it cannot be seen as a model for anyone if no one any longer takes it seriously as a global actor . 
But how can you be taken seriously by others if you do not take yourself seriously ? 
The EU &apos;s new High Representative for external affairs , Baroness Catherine Ashton , tried to justify her failure to go to Haiti in the immediate aftermath of its terrible earthquake by saying , &quot; I am neither a nurse nor a fire person . &quot; 
Lack of such skills did not keep US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from traveling to the scene of the devastation to show here support and concern . 
Confronted with revolutionary demographic and economic transformations , Americans and Europeans should behave in a much more responsible manner . 
Instead of ignoring the other ( the American way ) or lamenting a wounded ego ( the European way ) , they should confront the common challenges they face as a result of a globalization process that they are no longer able to master .
