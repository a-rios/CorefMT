Markets vs. Market Psychology 
The sharp one-day drop in the Chinese stock market on February 27 apparently had an enduring negative effect on major stock markets around the world . 
By the time the exchange closed at 7 : 00 GMT that Tuesday , the Shanghai Composite Index had fallen 8.8 % for the day - the biggest one-day fall in China in ten years . 
A cascade of declines in other countries immediately followed . 
In Singapore , the Straits Times Index was down 2.3 % when the market closed . 
In Bombay , the Sensex 30 fell by 1.3 % that day at the market &apos;s closing . 
In Moscow , the RTSI index was down by 3.3 % at its closing bell . 
In London , the FTSE 100 was off by 2.3 % when trading ended that day . 
In Sao Paolo , the Bovespa index was down by 6.6 % , and in New York the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by 3.3 % , when those markets closed at 21 : 00 GMT . 
These were significant declines - larger one-day drops in the Dow , for example , have occurred only 35 times since January 1950 , or about once every twenty months . 
Moreover , two weeks later , all these markets outside of China were down from 4.3 % to 7.8 % compared to their close on February 26 . 
This large and enduring effect has surprised many , since the &quot; story &quot; about the Chinese drop - that the trigger was a rumor that China &apos;s government , concerned about speculation , planned to impose controls on the stock market - seems to have no logical relevance elsewhere . 
But , unless one believes that stock markets move only in response to information about economic fundamentals , there really is no reason to be surprised . 
One-day drops in important stock markets have always had enduring and general effects , owing to market psychology . 
Given the international preoccupation with China &apos;s economic success , the country is now a highly salient market to investors all over the world . 
If history is any guide , markets can be severely destabilized by one-day drops , which make powerful stories that have more psychological salience to investors than much larger drops that occur over longer time intervals . 
For example , people were really agitated when the Dow dropped 3.8 % on December 6 , 1928 , nearly a year before the famous 13.5 % crash on Monday , October 29 , 1929 . 
Nowadays , of course , no one remembers that one-day slide in 1928 , but , from the participants &quot; perspective , it was an enormous event . 
Newspapers the next day described it as &quot; one of the severest declines the market has ever gone through , &quot; and &quot; the worst money scare since July 1 , 1920 . &quot; 
No news story that day discussed economic fundamentals or gave a clear indication of the cause of the decline , relying instead on sensational prose - &quot; the house that Jack built threatened to topple over &quot; and &quot; traders were quaking in their boots . &quot; 
But the December 6 , 1928 , event began a sequence of increasingly severe one-day drops in the Dow over the course of the following year . 
Despite a generally rising market , the Dow fell by 3.6 % on February 7 , 1929 , 4.1 % on March 25 , 4.2 % on May 22 , 4 % on May 27 and August 9 , 4.2 % on October 3 , and 6.3 % on October 23 , before the infamous &quot; Black Monday &quot; crash . 
On each occasion , newspaper accounts further established the 1929 market psychology . 
The story was always that speculation in the markets had government leaders worried , which is , of course , essentially the same story that we heard from China on February 27 . 
The historical parallels do not stop there . 
On September 11 , 1986 , the Dow dropped 4.6 % , the steepest one-day decline since May 28 , 1962 . 
This was followed the next day by a further 1.9 % decline , and then , over succeeding months , by a series of sharp one-day drops that were precursors to the 22.6 % collapse on October 19 , 1987 - the largest-ever one-day correction . 
At the time of the September 11-12 , 1986 , event , I thought very hard about what could have caused it . 
Media accounts were vague , with the respectable story pointing to the &quot; rekindling of inflation fears , &quot; which , in fact , was not news . 
I wondered what people were really thinking , apart from what could be read in the newspapers . 
Immediately afterward , I sent out a short questionnaire to 175 institutional investors and 125 individual investors in the United States . 
I asked , &quot; Can you remember any reason to buy or sell that you thought about on those days ? 
( Please try hard to remember . 
Don &apos;t cite something you thought or talked about later ) . &quot; 
The response rate was 38 % , and no reason was repeated by more than three respondents , except the stock-market drop itself . 
This , and a more elaborate questionnaire that I sent out after the next &quot; Black Monday &quot; crash on October 19 , 1987 , convinced me that nothing more sensible is occurring than just what newspapers describe : speculators , responding to changing market prices , and fearing further changes in the same direction , simply decide to bail out . 
The actual decision to do so often can wait until the next stimulus , that is , the next day that a big drop occurs - hence , the possibility of a sequence of large one-day declines . 
Unfortunately , this behavioral theory of stock market movements is not amenable to easy quantification and forecasting . 
After February 27 , 2007 , it looked as if the markets were settling down , and the VIX measure of stock market volatility had fallen back nearly to earlier levels . 
But then a 2 % fall in the Dow on March 13 pushed the VIX back up . 
The bright side is that one-day stock market declines occur more commonly as isolated events with no long-term repercussions . 
So investors must now hope that the latest episode will be forgotten - unless and until hope succumbs to market psychology .
