Testing America &apos;s Financial Stability 
WASHINGTON , DC - Far-reaching financial-reform legislation has just been enacted in the United States - a landmark response to the most devastating financial crisis in decades , and one that takes important and welcome steps toward addressing the many weaknesses in the US regulatory and financial system that the crisis revealed . 
While the Obama administration and the US Congress were drawing lessons from the crisis and deliberating on reforms , the International Monetary Fund was also assessing the US financial system under the Financial Sector Assessment Program ( FSAP ) . 
The FSAP was introduced in the wake of the Asia crisis in the mid-1990 &quot; s to enable objective assessment of the strengths and vulnerabilities of countries &apos; financial systems , including the extent to which they measure up to international standards . 
The latest global crisis prompted the G-20 to re-affirm the importance of these FSAP &quot; check-ups &quot; to efforts to promote global stability , and it has even committed its members to undergo them regularly . 
So , with the US now having undertaken this exam , what insights does it provide about the health of the US financial system and recent regulatory reforms ? 
The review contains many positive conclusions . 
It commends the US authorities for their bold and decisive action to stem the risk of systemic collapse during a period of extreme market turmoil . 
Although the crisis has imposed devastating costs nationally and internationally , the mistakes that led to the Great Depression seem to have been avoided . 
The US authorities also acted quickly to introduce reform legislation that addresses the weaknesses that led to the crisis . 
The passage of the Dodd-Frank Act by Congress represents a significant milestone in the reform of the US financial sector . 
Under the new act , a systemic risk regulator has been established , oversight of the shadow banking sector has been strengthened , and new mechanisms have been created to deal with the failure of systemically important non-banks . 
These reforms provide a basis for a safer and sounder financial system . 
Nevertheless , the FSAP assessment emphasizes that the job is not yet finished , and that there is critical work still to be done . 
First , while broad financial stability has been restored , and bank capital has been boosted significantly as a result of last year &apos;s &quot; stress tests , &quot; there are still important pockets of weakness . 
For , even if growth continues at its current pace , more capital will be needed , especially for small and mid-sized banks . 
These needs seem manageable , but , as recent events in Europe and recent US data have reminded us , the recovery and confidence remain fragile , especially against the backdrop of high public debt . 
If the economy were to weaken , the need for additional bank capital could be significant . 
Second , the Dodd-Frank Act represents a huge step forward in improving regulation of both individual financial institutions and the system as a whole . 
But it missed an important opportunity to streamline US supervisory agencies , leaving it unclear whether the longstanding gaps and conflicting mandates that contributed to the crisis have really been resolved . 
The legislation provides a skeleton for the new regulatory architecture , and it will be up to the new Financial Stability Oversight Council to put supervisory muscle on these bones : to improve interagency cooperation , tighten rules governing systemically important institutions , and respond quickly and forcefully to systemic risks . 
Third , reducing systemic risks will require determined action to ensure that financial institutions are not too big to fail . 
The new legislation takes important steps in this direction , calling for additional capital and other charges on firms in proportion to their systemic risks , requiring systemically important firms to prepare &quot; living wills &quot; so that they can be easily wound up , and introducing a special resolution framework if they do fail . 
But these measures cannot be a substitute for strong and pre-emptive consolidated supervision ; rules and regulations cannot be a substitute for the &quot; will to act . &quot; 
Fourth , reform of US housing finance remains unfinished business . 
Public policies to subsidize US mortgage lending have been costly , inefficient , and have encouraged excessive risk-taking , which helped push the system toward crisis . 
Concrete proposals for addressing this situation are now being formulated , but the financial system cannot be said to be repaired without a decisive resolution of America &apos;s &#91; government-sponsored &#93; mortgage agencies and significant cuts in US subsidies for mortgage borrowing . 
In sum , the US authorities have done much to strengthen the financial sector . 
Their participation in the FSAP assessment - and their agreement to publish the results - speaks to their commitment to global efforts to ensure that the crisis of the last three years will not be repeated . 
The true test , however , will be how the recent reforms are implemented domestically , and how they will be coordinated internationally .
