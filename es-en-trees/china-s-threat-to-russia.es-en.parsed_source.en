China &apos;s Threat to Russia 
Last week , Russia and China held joint military maneuvers in the presence of both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Hu Jintao . 
Indeed , China officially considers several regions in Russia &apos;s Far East to be only &quot; alienated &quot; from it . 
China &apos;s territorial claims on Russia are often noted in Chinese grade school geography textbooks , which include a number of Russian Far Eastern regions within China &apos;s borders . 
This is consistent with the Chinese strategic concept of &quot; vital space , &quot; which includes all spheres of a state &apos;s strategic activities , on land , at sea , under water , in the air , and in space . 
The dimensions of &quot; vital space &quot; are determined by a country &apos;s economic , scientific , technical , social , and military capabilities - in essence , its &quot; total power . &quot; 
According to Chinese theorists , the &quot; vital space &quot; of great powers extends far beyond a state &apos;s borders , whereas the &quot; vital space &quot; of weak countries is limited to strategic boundaries that do not always correspond to the borders of their national territory . 
Today , China has territorial claims against 11 of its 24 neighbors , including India , Japan , Vietnam , and the Philippines , in addition to Russia . 
In China &apos;s relations with all of them , the potential use of military force was and remains an important factor . 
In September 2006 , China &apos;s People &apos;s Liberation Army ( PLA ) conducted an unprecedentedly large 10-day exercise , involving the Shenyang and Beijing military districts , the two most powerful of China &apos;s seven military districts . 
Shenyang abuts the Russian Armed Forces &quot; Far Eastern District , and the Beijing district shares a border with Russia &apos;s Siberian Military District . 
During the exercises , Shenyang units advanced 1,000 kilometers into the Beijing district , where they engaged in joint war games . 
To military observers , the Beijing / Shenyang exercises seemed to be practice for a possible offensive operation against Russia , because exercises on such a scale are undertaken only at the final stage of a multi-year program to train troops to enact specific strategic and operational plans . 
The geography of the exercises , and the offensive nature of the tasks undertaken , leaves little doubt that Russia was cast in the role of &quot; potential adversary . &quot; 
Such a show of force is an ancient , traditional Chinese political technique . 
Paradoxically , these exercises were undertaken during a period when bilateral political and economic ties appeared on the surface to be at their highest point . 
Russia has an important place in Chinese geopolitical calculations , as a supplier of both modern weaponry and energy resources needed to continue its modernization . 
Therefore , the Chinese are doing everything possible to strengthen their economic and political position in Russia , and to draw Russia into their sphere of influence . 
And China is succeeding , most importantly by consistently reinforcing Putin &apos;s anti-American and anti-Western agenda . 
While Beijing / Shenyang exercise should have indicated to Russian leaders that China &apos;s intentions toward Russia may not always be benign , Russia &apos;s political and military leadership seem not to sense any threat ; on the contrary , they continue to sell the Chinese advanced weapons . 
Russia &apos;s current diplomatic tilt , indeed , is clearly against its own long-term national security interests . 
China will never be interested in Russia &apos;s economic and political modernization , for it prefers Russia to remain a source of mineral and energy resources and a vast &quot; strategic rear &quot; in its looming challenge with the United States . 
Likewise , the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) , which just concluded its annual meeting , is in China &apos;s eyes a tool of regional policy that helps strengthen China &apos;s influence and control over Central Asia &apos;s natural resources at the expense of Russia . 
No nation threatens China &apos;s land borders . 
China can solve its domestic problems , such as separatism , by itself . 
China is militarily self-sufficient and needs military cooperation under the SCO framework only in order to free its hands if any conflict should arise that affects its interests . 
In fact , conflict between Russia and China is possible precisely in Central Asia , given the clear differences in the two countries &quot; economic and political interests in that region . 
Aside from control of the region &apos;s energy supplies , water has become a potential source of conflict , given China &apos;s serious shortages . 
Yet , while the Chinese clearly understand these contingencies and are preparing themselves to deal with them diplomatically and militarily , the Kremlin remains myopically obsessed with the phantom threat of America . 
Thus , as the Kremlin dreams of re-establishing its domination over what Russians refer to as the &quot; near abroad &quot; ( Ukraine , Belarus , the Baltic countries , and the other post-Soviet states ) , China is increasingly looking at Russia as its own &quot; near abroad . &quot; 
Will the Kremlin finally wake up to this ? 
Thirty-six years ago , Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong turned world politics upside down , as both America and China realized that it was the Soviet Union , and not each other , that posed the greater threat . 
Vladimir Putin needs his own &quot; Nixon moment . &quot; 
Alienating the West is a foolish strategy when the greatest long term threat to Russia comes from the East .
