America &apos;s Rehearsals for Retirement 
BERKELEY - As the first wave of America &apos;s baby boomers begins to retire , the retirement system is revealing its flaws . 
More than half of all workers ( and more than 60 % of low-income workers ) are at risk of lacking sufficient savings to maintain their living standards after they stop working . 
In a recent international comparison , America &apos;s retirement system received a passing grade of C ; but , for a large and growing number of Americans , the system is failing . 
The slow recovery from the Great Recession has exacerbated the challenge . 
Homes are most Americans &quot; major retirement asset , and , despite a recent pickup , housing prices are still 28 % below their 2006 peak , while 28 % of all homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their property is worth . 
Discretionary employer retirement plans are a major pillar of America &apos;s retirement system . 
But nearly 16 million Americans are either unemployed or have dropped out of the labor force , while more than half of the jobs created during the recovery are low-wage positions that usually do not offer such plans . 
By contrast , most of the 625,000 public-sector jobs lost during the recovery offered generous pensions . 
Nearly 60 % of all employed private-sector workers aged 25-64 are not covered by employer retirement plans , and coverage rates vary by income : 73 % of all workers in the top earnings quartile are covered by such plans , compared to only 38 % in the bottom quartile . 
Plan participation also varies by income , with low-income workers much less likely to participate than high-income workers . 
The lack of universal coverage also means that workers move in and out of plans as they change jobs ; more than one-third of all households end up with no employer-based pension coverage . 
By contrast , in several other countries , mandatory employer and employee participation in national employer-based plans means nearly universal coverage . 
Personal retirement savings , another pillar of the US retirement system , are woefully inadequate for most households , partly because the decades-long stagnation in median wages has made it difficult to save . 
According to a recent study , one-third of Americans aged 45-54 have nothing saved specifically for retirement . 
Meanwhile , three-quarters of near-retirees - those aged 50-64 - have annual incomes below $ 52,201 and average total retirement savings of less than $ 27,000 . 
The United States relies on generous tax incentives to encourage personal retirement savings , but these incentives are poorly targeted and yield limited returns . 
More than 80 % of the value of these incentives goes to the top 20 % of taxpayers , who earn more than $ 100,000 a year . 
Moreover , while the incentives cost the US Treasury nearly $ 100 billion annually , they induce little new saving ; instead , they cause high-income taxpayers to shift their savings to tax-advantaged assets - a major reason why President Barack Obama proposes capping the tax deduction for retirement saving . 
A more radical proposal would convert the tax deduction into a means-tested and refundable matching government contribution - deposited directly into a taxpayer &apos;s individual retirement account ( IRA ) . 
Taxpayers are more responsive to matching incentives than they are to tax incentives , because the former are easier to understand and more transparent . 
Lack of coverage in employer-based plans and insufficient personal savings leave more than one-third of all households ( and more than 75 % of low-income households ) entirely dependent on Social Security for their retirement income . 
And , because Social Security replaces only about 40 % of pre-retirement income for low-wage workers and less than a third for median-wage workers , those who rely on it as their sole source of income live at or below the poverty line . 
( Replacement rates in other developed countries are in the 70 % range , compared to a benchmark of 80 % recommended by retirement experts . ) 
Addressing the looming retirement crisis in the US requires increasing worker coverage in employer-based plans . 
Here , automatic enrollment , unless workers opt out , has proved effective , boosting employee participation to more than 90 % . 
Indeed , recent research indicates that automatic enrollment is much more effective than tax incentives for increasing retirement saving . 
But many employers do not offer retirement plans , while almost all workers are eligible for tax-advantaged IRAs . 
As Obama has proposed , employers that do not offer retirement plans should be required to offer automatic contributions to their workers &quot; IRAs through regular payroll deductions . 
Matching government contributions should be used in lieu of , or in addition to , tax deductions to encourage low-income workers to participate . 
California and several other US states are also evaluating new state-administered retirement-savings programs for private-sector workers without access to employer-based plans . 
The California plan , based on a proposal by Teresa Ghilarducci and her colleagues , would automatically enroll eligible employees , defined as private-sector workers at firms with five or more employees that do not offer retirement plans . 
Contributions would be made through automatic payroll deductions by employers at a default rate of 3 % of gross pay , but employees could opt out or adjust their contribution rates . 
Under this scheme , each worker would have an individual account balance ( treated as an IRA from a tax perspective ) , but the assets that secure the plan &apos;s benefits would be held in a pooled trust , with a real return guaranteed by private insurance and paid out as an annuity upon retirement . 
Accounts would be linked to workers , not to their employers , ensuring portability between jobs . 
( The lack of portability and the absence of annuity payouts are major shortcomings of most employer plans . ) 
An independent board would oversee the state plan &apos;s administration , relying on a competitive bidding process to select investment managers . 
Senator Tom Harkin recently proposed a national plan with many similar features , open to all workers whose employer plans do not meet minimum requirements . 
The countries that outrank the US on the global retirement index in terms of coverage , adequacy of benefits , and long-term sustainability have national pension plans in addition to their basic social-security-type programs . 
Some are mandatory , some have automatic enrollment , and some rely on matching government contributions to encourage participation . 
In the US , making saving easier and more financially rewarding through better-targeted tax incentives , matching government contributions , automatic IRAs , and state-wide retirement plans would help boost retirement savings , especially for low- and middle-income households . 
Improving financial literacy would also help . 
The current obsession with government deficits and budgetary constraints should not deflect attention from the need for reforms that address the looming retirement crisis confronting many Americans .
