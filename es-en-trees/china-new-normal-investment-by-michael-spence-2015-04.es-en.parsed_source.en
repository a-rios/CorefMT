China &apos;s Slowing New Normal 
MILAN - The world &apos;s two largest economies , the United States and China , seem to be enduring secular slowdowns . 
But there remains considerable uncertainty about their growth trajectory , with significant implications for asset prices , risk , and economic policy . 
The US seems to be settling into annual real ( inflation-adjusted ) growth rates of around 2 % , though whether this is at or below the economy &apos;s potential remains a source of heated debate . 
Meanwhile , China seems to be headed for the 6-7 % growth rate that the government pinpointed last year as the economy &apos;s &quot; new normal . &quot; 
Some observers agree that such a rate can be sustained for the next decade or so , provided that the government implements a comprehensive set of reforms in the coming few years . 
Others , however , expect China &apos;s GDP growth to continue to trend downward , with the possibility of a hard landing . 
There is certainly cause for concern . 
Slow and uncertain growth in Europe - a major trading partner for both the US and China - is creating headwinds for the US and China . 
Moreover , the US and China - indeed , the entire global economy - are suffering from weak aggregate demand , which is creating deflationary pressures . 
As central banks attempt to combat these pressures by lowering interest rates , they are inadvertently causing releveraging ( an unsustainable growth pattern ) , elevated asset prices ( with some risk of a downward correction , given slow growth ) , and devaluations ( which merely move demand around the global economy , without increasing it ) . 
For China , which to some extent still depends on external markets to drive economic growth , this environment is particularly challenging - especially as currency depreciation in Europe and Japan erode export demand further . 
Even without the crisis in major external markets , however , a large and complex middle-income economy like China &apos;s could not realistically expect growth rates above 6-7 % . 
Yet , in the aftermath of the global economic crisis , China insisted on maintaining extremely high growth rates of 9 % for two years , by relying on fiscal stimulus , huge liquidity injections , and a temporary halt in the renminbi &apos;s appreciation . 
Had the government signaled the &quot; new normal &quot; earlier , expectations would have been conditioned differently . 
This would have discouraged undue investment in some sectors , reduced non-performing loans , and contained excessive leverage in the corporate sector , while avoiding the mispricing of commodities . 
Growth would still have slowed , but with far less risk . 
In the current situation , however , China faces serious challenges . 
Given weak growth in external demand and an already-large market share for many goods , China cannot count on export growth to sustain economic performance in the short run . 
And , though support for infrastructure investment by China &apos;s trading partners - especially through the &quot; one belt , one road &quot; policy - may help to strengthen external markets in the longer term , this is no substitute for domestic aggregate demand . 
Investment can sustainably drive growth only up to the point when returns decline dramatically . 
In the case of public-sector investment , that means that the present value of the increment to the future GDP path ( using a social discount rate ) is greater than the investment itself . 
The good news is that growing discipline seems to be pushing out low-return investment . 
And there is every reason to believe that investment will remain high as the economy &apos;s capital base expands . 
But , in order to boost demand , China will also need increased household consumption and improved delivery of higher-value services . 
Recent data suggest that , notwithstanding recent wage increases , consumption amounts to only about 35 % of GDP . 
With a high household savings rate of around 30 % of disposable income , per capita disposable income amounts to roughly half of per capita GDP . 
Expanded social-security programs and a richer menu of saving and investment options could go a long way toward reducing precautionary saving and boosting consumption . 
But what is really needed is a shift in the distribution of income toward households . 
Without a concerted effort to increase households &quot; share of total income and raise consumption &apos;s share of aggregate demand , growth of consumer products and services on the supply side will remain inadequate . 
Given that services are a significant source of incremental employment , their expansion , in particular , would help to sustain inclusive growth . 
Another key challenge concerns China &apos;s slumping property sector , in which construction and prices dropped rapidly last year . 
If highly leveraged developers are under stress , they could produce non-performing loans - and thus considerable risk - in both the traditional and shadow banking sectors . 
Fortunately , Chinese households &quot; relatively low leverage means that the kind of balance-sheet damage that occurred in some advanced countries during the crisis , leading to a huge drop in demand , is unlikely , even if real-estate prices continue to decline . 
It also means that there remains some space for expanding consumer credit to boost demand . 
That is not the only source of hope . 
Wages are rising , deposit insurance will be introduced , and deposit rates are being liberalized . 
Internet investment vehicles are growing . 
New businesses in the services sector - 3.6 million of which were started just last year - are generating incremental employment , thanks partly to a new streamlined licensing framework . 
And online platforms are facilitating increased consumption , while expanding market access and financing for smaller businesses . 
China &apos;s leaders should aim to accelerate and build upon these trends , rather than pursuing additional fiscal and monetary stimulus . 
Public investment is high enough ; expanding it now would shift the composition of aggregate demand in the wrong direction . 
And , with the corporate sector already overleveraged , a broad-based expansion of credit is not safe . 
Any fiscal stimulus now should focus on improving public services , encouraging consumption , and increasing household income . 
Accelerating the expansion of state-funded social security could bring down household savings over time . 
More generally , China must deploy its large balance sheet to deliver income or benefits that expand what households view as safely consumable income . 
Given that private investment responds mainly to demand , such measures would likely reverse its current downward path . 
A further slowdown in China is a distinct possibility . 
China &apos;s leaders must do what it takes to ensure that such a slowdown is not viewed as secular trend - a perception that could undermine the consumption and investment that the economy so badly needs .
