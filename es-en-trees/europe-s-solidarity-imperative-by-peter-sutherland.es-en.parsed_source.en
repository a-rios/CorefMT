Europe &apos;s Solidarity Imperative 
LONDON - When Mario Draghi , the president of the European Central Bank , publicly proclaimed that the ECB would do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to ensure the future stability of the euro , the effect of his remarks was immediate and remarkable . 
Borrowing costs fell dramatically for the governments of Italy and Spain ; stock markets rallied ; and the recent decline in the external value of the euro was suddenly checked . 
It remains unclear how long-lasting the effects of Draghi &apos;s intervention - or of the public support offered to him by German Chancellor Angela Merkel , French President Fran√ßois Hollande , and Italian premier Mario Monti - will prove to be . 
What we can say with certainty is that Draghi &apos;s remarks and the reaction they evoked demonstrate that the fundamental problems of the eurozone are not primarily financial or economic ; they are political , psychological , and institutional . 
International observers took such notice of Draghi &apos;s commitment to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to save the euro because so many of them have come to doubt other leading European players &quot; commitment to do likewise . 
( Some of these doubts are , of course , politically or financially self-serving ; a certain model of financial capitalism perceives the euro as a threat , and its adherents will do everything they can to bring about its demise . ) 
But eurozone leaders &quot; inability to assuage doubt about their commitment to the euro after two and a half years of crisis suggests that the problem is deeply rooted . 
In their own defense , eurozone ministers point to the raft of reforms that they have introduced over the past 30 months , which will promote economic modernization , the restoration of sound government finances , and closer economic coordination . 
Unfortunately , these reforms have all too often served as displacement activity - worthwhile in themselves , but failing to answer unambiguously the question posed with increasing urgency by international markets : Are the eurozone &apos;s largest and currently most prosperous members absolutely committed to its continuation ? 
No one doubts that Germany and most other eurozone members would prefer the single currency to continue . 
Today &apos;s uncertainty concerns whether this preference may be overridden by pressing considerations of national politics , or resentment at the slow pace of reform in certain eurozone countries . 
Indeed , a German proverb to the effect that &quot; trust is good , but control is better &quot; has been the basis of eurozone leaders &quot; policy since the developed world &apos;s debt crisis engulfed the single currency &apos;s system of governance . 
The implication is clear : trust between the members of the eurozone cannot be taken for granted , but must be earned and maintained . 
The limitations of this approach have now been revealed . 
While the eurozone &apos;s richer countries have indeed done much to help their troubled neighbors , they have done so in an obtrusively conditional , transitional , and incremental fashion . 
At one level , it is entirely understandable that Germany and other eurozone countries should demand assurances that their resources will not be wasted . 
But this constant need for reassurance , for the limiting of risk and involvement to the minimum necessary , provokes a fear that at some point Germany and others will judge their partners &quot; assurances insufficient and the risks run in helping them intolerable . 
If that happens , the euro &apos;s demise cannot be far behind . 
The Treaty of Rome , signed in 1957 , represented a noble and ambitious departure in European history . 
Solidarity and predictability in international relations , based on common institutions and common interests , would ensure Europe &apos;s prosperity and stability much more effectively than had the traditional balancing act of high-wire diplomacy , whose practitioners had too often crashed to the ground . 
The euro was founded in this spirit of solidarity , and its contribution to limiting economic and financial instability in Europe over the past five years should not be underestimated . 
The example of the 1930 &quot; s is a reminder of how much worse things might have been . 
Eurozone leaders &quot; temptation to revert to earlier , discredited models of European relationships was bearable for a time , but it has now reached the limit of its tolerability . 
My impression is that German public and political opinion is beginning to recognize the economic devastation for Europe and Germany implied by a euro breakup . 
German politicians bear the important democratic responsibility of reinforcing this realization and advocating the steps needed to avert a catastrophe . 
It can be no part of a well-functioning democracy for leaders to hide unwelcome truths from their electorates . 
It would be a delusion to imagine that the eurozone need only follow its current path to ensure the single currency &apos;s future . 
If nothing else , that current path unacceptably accentuates the differences between member states in a way that is politically and economically unsustainable in the longer term . 
The philosophy of control and reciprocity that until now has characterized the eurozone &apos;s approach to its crisis of governance needs to be replaced by one of solidarity and all that follows from it . 
This means a more balanced economic policy within the eurozone , an enhanced role for the ECB , a real banking and financial union , and a road map to partial and conditional mutualization of legacy debt . 
Eurozone leaders have spoken about all of these , but the time has come for unequivocal commitments and a realistic timetable for action . 
We are now perilously close to the moment when &quot; muddling through &quot; could give way to renewed crisis . 
So the Bundesbank &apos;s self-righteous zeal in asserting that its responsibilities are somehow graver - and more binding - than those of other central banks is dangerously wrong-headed . 
&quot; Nein &quot; merely brings calamity closer . 
None of Europe &apos;s financial problems would look remotely as challenging today if doubts about the eurozone &apos;s future had been dispelled two years ago , and the reputational and financial costs would have been dramatically less than they have been in the past 30 months . 
In the long run , solidarity is cheaper for all involved , while its absence could become ruinously expensive in the foreseeable future .
