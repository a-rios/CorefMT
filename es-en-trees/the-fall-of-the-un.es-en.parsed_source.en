The Fall of the UN 
Saddam Hussein &apos;s reign of terror is about to end . 
His Ba &apos;athist government , however , will not go alone . 
In a fitting irony , the United Nations is going down with him . 
Perhaps the entire UN will not disappear . 
Those parts devoted to &quot; good works &quot; ( i.e. , the low-risk peacekeeping bureaucracies or those that fight AIDs and malaria or protect children ) will remain . 
The looming chatterbox on New York &apos;s East River will also continue to bleat . 
What died with the Security Council &apos;s unwillingness to sanction force to implement its own resolutions on Iraq &apos;s possession of weapons of mass destruction was the decades-old fantasy of the UN as the bedrock of world order . 
As we sift the debris of the war to liberate Iraq , it will be important to preserve-the better to understand-the intellectual wreckage of the liberal conceit of security through international law administered by international institutions . 
As free Iraqis document the quarter-century nightmare of Saddam &apos;s rule , we must not forget who supported this war and who did not , who held that the international community &apos;s moral authority was enshrined in pleas for more time for the UN arms inspectors , and who marched against &quot; regime change . &quot; 
In the spirit of post-war reconciliation that diplomats are always keen to engender , we must not reconcile ourselves to the timid , blighted notion that world order requires us to recoil before rogue states that terrorize their citizens and menace our own . 
Decent , thoughtful , high-minded , the millions who marched against holding Iraq to account were catalyzed by the idea that only the UN Security Council has the authority to legitimize the resort to force . 
A voluntary coalition of liberal democracies willing to put their own soldiers in harm &apos;s way isn &apos;t good enough . 
It does not seem to matter that such troops are being used to enforce the UN &apos;s own demands . 
If a country or coalition of countries other than the UN Security Council uses force , even as a last resort , &quot; anarchy , &quot; not international law , would prevail , destroying all hope of world order . 
Or so the protestors believed . 
But this is a dangerously wrong idea , an idea that leads inexorably to handing great moral ( and even existential politico-military decisions ) to the likes of Syria , Cameroon , Angola , Russia , China , and France . 
If a policy is right when the Security Council approves , how can it be wrong just because communist China or Russia or France or a gaggle of minor dictatorships withhold approbation ? 
Those who opposed the actions of the coalition in Iraq usually fall back on the answer that &quot; order &quot; must have primacy over &quot; anarchy . &quot; 
But is this right ? 
Is the UN Security Council the institution most capable of ensuring order and saving us from anarchy ? 
History suggests not . 
The UN arose from the ashes of a war that the League of Nations was unable to avert . 
The League was simply not up to confronting Italy in Abyssinia , much less ( had it survived that debacle ) taking on Nazi Germany . 
In the euphoric aftermath of the victory in World War Two , the hope that security could be made collective was reposed in the UN Security Council-with abject results . 
During the Cold War the Security Council was hopelessly paralyzed . 
Indeed , the decision to defend South Korea from attack in 1950 was taken by the Council only because Stalin ordered his diplomats to boycott UN proceedings , which meant that no Soviet ambassador was around to cast a veto . 
It was a mistake the Soviets would not make again . 
In both 1967 and 1973 , with war looming , the UN withdrew from the Middle East , leaving Israel to defend itself . 
The Soviet empire was wrestled to the ground , and Eastern Europe liberated , not by the UN but by the mother of all coalitions , NATO . 
Facing Milosevic &apos;s multiple aggressions , the UN could not stop the Balkan wars or even protect its victims . 
Remember Sarajevo ? 
Remember Srebrenica and the slaughter of thousands of Muslims under the supposed protection of the UN ? 
It took a coalition of the willing to save Bosnia from extinction . 
When the war was over , peace was made in Dayton , Ohio , not at the UN . 
The rescue of Kosovo &apos;s Muslims was not a UN action : their cause never gained Security Council approval . 
This century now challenges the hopes for a new world order in new ways . 
We will not defeat or even contain fanatical terror unless we can carry the war to the territories from which it is launched . 
This will sometimes require that we use force against states that harbor terrorists , as we did in destroying the Taliban regime in Afghanistan . 
The most dangerous of these states are those that possess weapons of mass destruction , the chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons that can kill not hundreds or thousands but hundreds of thousands . 
Iraq was such a state , but there are others . 
Whatever hope exists that they can be persuaded to withdraw support or sanctuary from terrorists rests on the certainty and effectiveness with which they are confronted . 
The chronic failure of the Security Council to enforce its own resolutions ( with respect to Iraq ) is unmistakable : it is simply not up to the task . 
So we are left with coalitions of the willing . 
Far from disparaging them as a threat to a new world order , we should recognize that they are , by default , the best hope for that order , and the true alternative to the anarchy caused by the dismal failure of the United Nations .
