Learning from Mexico 
On July 2 , Mexico held a presidential election that triggered what has become a bitter political firefight . 
After conservative candidate Felipe Calderon was declared the winner by less than 1 % of the vote , his populist rival , Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , quickly claimed fraud . 
For the past two months , thousands of Lopez Obrador &apos;s most fervent supporters have transformed the Zocalo , Mexico City &apos;s central square , into a virtual sea of tents - the center of gravity of opposition to the official result . 
On September 1 , dozens of opposition lawmakers created a primetime spectacle inside Mexico &apos;s parliament by occupying the speaker &apos;s podium , thereby denying outgoing President Vicente Fox the chance to deliver his final state of the nation address in person . 
Four days later , Mexico highest electoral court ruled that Fox had improperly interfered in the election but unanimously reaffirmed Calderon &apos;s victory . 
Lopez Obrador has vowed to obstruct Calderon &apos;s presidency from the moment he takes office on December 1 . 
You learn a lot about a country &apos;s underlying stability by how it responds to a crisis . 
Similar electoral conflicts unfolded in the United States in 2000 and in Ukraine in 2004 . 
In the wake of fiercely contested presidential elections , large numbers of voters in each country questioned the legitimacy of the outcome . 
But US political and economic stability was never in doubt in 2000 , because public confidence in the country &apos;s governing institutions allowed them to resolve the conflict peacefully . 
These institutions proved far more powerful than the political personalities involved . 
In Ukraine , on the other hand , public outrage , buttressed by international pressure , brought the government to a halt . 
In a second vote , the election &apos;s loser was crowned the winner . 
But the initial euphoria that accompanied the so-called &quot; Orange Revolution &quot; quickly faded , and Ukraine is still dealing with the political and economic fallout . 
What , then , should we make of Mexico and its disputed election ? 
Here , too , a large segment of the electorate told pollsters that they doubted the legitimacy of the official result . 
The judiciary rejected calls for a full recount , though they did examine roughly 9 % of the ballots before ruling that the review indicated no challenge to the election &apos;s outcome . 
Like Ukraine &apos;s Viktor Yushchenko , who lost the initial vote in Ukraine , Lopez Obrador demanded that the result be overturned . 
Unlike Yushchenko , he was denied . 
But the good news for Mexicans is that their country &apos;s political institutions have proven far more stable than did Ukraine &apos;s . 
Despite Lopez Obrador &apos;s best efforts to create chaos in the streets with public demonstrations involving hundreds of thousands of protesters , domestic and international confidence remains strong . 
The peso has barely budged since the election - a clear indication that investors have not lost faith in the country . 
Their resilience is important , because market fears of instability often become a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
The point is not that public confidence ( or lack thereof ) in an election outcome doesn &apos;t matter . 
It does . 
Unlike in Ukraine , investors have shrugged off the noisy demonstrations in Mexico City &apos;s streets and remained focused on interest rates and fluctuations in the global economy . 
Indeed , while Lopez Obrador continues to denounce the outcome and has threatened to make Mexico ungovernable , Mexico &apos;s growing middle class has taken the political conflict in stride . 
Many who supported Lopez Obrador &apos;s candidacy do not support the post-election protests in his name . 
A recent poll in the newspaper Reforma found that Calderon would now defeat him by 19 percentage points . 
Voters may prefer Lopez Obrador , but they value Mexico &apos;s stability above all . 
Moreover , during the political standoff , Calderon has worked behind the scenes to form an administration and to settle on a governing strategy . 
Aware that he must establish a greater sense of political legitimacy , his cabinet is likely to include representatives of other political parties . 
He will probably introduce measures to tackle poverty and create jobs . 
Calderon &apos;s task will not be easy . 
Lopez Obrador and his supporters can be expected to work relentlessly to thwart his plans . 
The underlying stability highlighted by Mexico &apos;s post-election crisis is also evident elsewhere in Latin America . 
Whatever the potential for a leftward shift this year in some Latin American countries , others , including Mexico , Chile , and Brazil , are clearly less vulnerable to the type of populist rule we &apos;ve seen in Venezuela and Bolivia . 
Elected leaders in these countries face institutional constraints - parliaments that check the powers of the executive and courts that check the powers of both - on their ability to shape policy . 
To be sure , political and market volatility in a broad range of emerging-market economies will continue . 
Beyond Latin America , several Eastern European countries offer ready examples . 
In these states , regulatory and taxation issues now affect confidence more deeply and consistently than does political tension . 
Many in the media may not comprehend that yet . 
Though Mexico &apos;s election saga may continue to make headlines , its true significance is that it reveals just how politically sturdy a place Mexico has become .
