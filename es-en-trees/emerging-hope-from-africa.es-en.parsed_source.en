Emerging Hope from Africa 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has put Africa squarely on the agenda of next week &apos;s G8 Summit . 
We in Liberia and across Africa welcome her leadership , and are grateful for the G8 &quot; s support for Africa , particularly its commitments in recent years to reduce debt burdens , double aid by 2010 , expand trade access , and fight HIV / AIDS . 
Strong efforts by Africans , coupled with the investments of the G8 and other partners , are paying off in important ways that are often unnoticed by the outside world . 
Consider three major historical trends . 
First , in 1989 , there were just four democracies in Africa . 
Today , there are at least 18 , including South Africa , Mozambique , Tanzania , Benin , Mali , Ghana , Senegal , with Liberia the most recent to join the group . 
Second , economic policies have greatly improved . 
With few exceptions , gone are the days of dual exchange rates , hyperinflation , and extensive trade barriers . 
Third , for many countries , the 25-year-old debt crisis is finally over , allowing much higher investment in health , education , and infrastructure . 
These three trends overlap in a group of about 15 African countries that are strongly committed to accountable governance and sensible economic policies . 
These countries are putting more kids in school , vigorously fighting diseases , and creating new economic opportunities for the poor . 
Average incomes have increased by 25 % over the last decade - a far cry from the zero growth of the past . 
Their recovery is still fragile , but it is real and tangible , and it is providing new hope across the continent . 
Most of the credit for these changes goes to Africans who demanded an end to the misrule of the past . 
The dual challenges are to sustain this progress in countries where it has started , and to initiate it in others . 
The G8 can take four steps towards these ends . 
First , it can ensure that its members are on track to double aid to Africa by 2010 . 
While progress has been made , it appears several countries are falling behind on this pledge . 
Second , it can focus new resources in critical areas such as education , malaria , agriculture , and infrastructure , and ensure that most funding goes to well-governed countries . 
Third , it can complete the process of debt relief for countries that have not received it , and help protect poor countries from predatory commercial creditors . 
Finally , it can expand market access for African exporters , especially by redoubling efforts to complete the Doha round of global trade talks . 
My own country , Liberia , embodies Africa &apos;s emerging hope and the progress that can be made through a commitment to good governance and strong international support . 
Just four years ago , we were enmeshed in a brutal 14-year civil war that claimed 270,000 lives , destroyed the fabric of our communities , and reduced average income by over 80 % . 
Liberia was Africa &apos;s basket case . 
Today , the war is over . 
Through two rounds of free and democratic elections in 2005 , the people of Liberia courageously chose peace , reconciliation , and development over ethnic divisions and violence . 
Since then revenues have doubled , the economy is growing by 8 % per year , school enrollment is up 50 % , and electricity and water have been restored to parts of Monrovia for the first time in 15 years . 
Families are being reunited , and , after years of suffering , there is finally hope for the future . 
Liberians have made tremendous sacrifices . 
Nevertheless , our recovery remains fragile , and our success is far from assured . 
It will take years to rebuild physical infrastructure , establish strong institutions , and heal the wounds of war . 
As has been the case in some other countries , a return to conflict remains a threat if a clear peace dividend does not quickly materialize throughout the country . 
The stakes for Liberia and for the region could not be higher . 
With this support , in a few years we will be able to stand on our own two feet again . 
Debt relief is at the heart of the support we need . 
Our external debt exceeds $ 4 billion , more than 3,000 % of annual exports . 
Most of this is accumulated interest on loans borrowed by rapacious dictators of the past . 
We have met all of the conditions asked by the international community to start the debt relief process , but creditor countries have not yet agreed on the financing . 
We hope that the G8 can help finalize these arrangements , and can help us ensure that the costs of debt relief are shared among all creditors , including those from the private sector . 
The people of Liberia are grateful for the strong support we have received as we have moved from the crisis of the past to the opportunity of the present . 
We hope you will continue to stand with us as we fight to secure peace , provide basic freedoms , and create the opportunity to rebuild our lives .
