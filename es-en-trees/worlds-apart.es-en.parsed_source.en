Worlds Apart 
Macroeconomic policies , financial globalization , and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades , not only in income and wealth , but also in access to education , healthcare , social protection , as well as in political participation and influence . 
Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth , an array of factors , exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes , has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge , social responsibility , and life chances from one generation to the next . 
As surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality Predicament , few countries , rich or poor , have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality , or to its consequences for education , health , and social welfare . 
Of course , there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence . 
But inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability , threatening security . 
Excluded and facing bleak life prospects , young people , in particular , often experience anomie and may turn to anti-social behavior , including violence . 
Nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty . 
Clearly , however , poverty arises from various complex conditions , and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach . 
It is hard to imagine , for example , how to &quot; make poverty history &quot; without also generating enough decent work , educational opportunities , and healthcare for all . 
To be sure , the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades . 
Access to education for girls has improved , and some gender gaps have been reduced . 
Despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis , life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems . 
Overall , however , the inequality gaps are large and , in many cases , growing . 
The most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality , with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries . 
Meanwhile , growing unemployment , widening skill and productivity gaps , and the &quot; informalization &quot; or &quot; casualization &quot; of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide , as the number of &quot; working poor &quot; and the incidence of &quot; jobless growth &quot; has spread . 
Nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs , imposed since the 1980 &quot; s , delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth . 
Growth in much of the world during the past quarter-century has been slower than in the previous 25 years , despite more rapid growth in East Asia , India , and a few other countries . 
Such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally . 
But inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years , largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels . 
Indeed , in much of the world , such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government , while otherwise increasing overall inequalities . 
The few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions . 
But they are exceptions : the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries , with rising unemployment , greater earnings disparities , reduced social protection , and environmental degradation . 
International financial liberalization , for example , has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities . 
In addition , contrary to the promises of its proponents , financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital-poor to the capital-rich over the long term , while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity . 
Meanwhile , free-trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends . 
Developing countries &quot; international terms of trade have worsened : prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures , as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture , and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights . 
As a result , trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de-industrialization and greater unemployment in much of the world , as in the case of garments this year . 
And , while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries , the main beneficiaries will be the more well-to-do agricultural exporters . 
Countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off . 
The &quot; retreat of the state &quot; in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government , including the capacity to lead and sustain development , as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education , health , housing , and utilities . 
The economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start , and its consequences have become glaringly obvious . 
Unless the world refocuses economic policies to address the adverse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction , the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart .
