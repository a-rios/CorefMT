Inside America &apos;s Tax Battle 
BERKELEY - America &apos;s recent presidential election answered the question of whether an increase in revenues will be part of the country &apos;s long-run deficit-reduction plan . 
The answer is yes : there is now bipartisan agreement on the need for a &quot; balanced &quot; approach that includes revenue increases and spending cuts . 
But there are still deep political and ideological divisions about how additional revenues should be raised and who should pay higher taxes . 
If a preliminary agreement on these questions is not reached by the end of the year , the economy faces a &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; of $ 600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts that will shave about 4 % from GDP and trigger a recession . 
The majority of citizens agree with President Barack Obama that tax increases for deficit reduction should fall on the top 2-3 % of taxpayers , who have enjoyed the largest gains in income and wealth over the last 30 years . 
That is why he is proposing that the 2001 and 2003 rate cuts for these taxpayers be allowed to expire at the end of the year , while the rate cuts for other taxpayers are extended . 
So far , Obama &apos;s Republican opponents are adamant that the cuts be extended for all taxpayers , arguing that increases in top rates would discourage job creation . 
This claim is not supported by the evidence . 
Recent research finds no link between tax cuts for top taxpayers and job creation . 
In contrast , tax cuts for the bottom 95 % have a positive and significant effect on job growth . 
During the past three decades , income inequality in the United States has increased significantly ; indeed , the US now has the fourth-highest level of income inequality in the OECD , behind Chile , Mexico , and Turkey . 
At the same time , as the largest tax cuts have gone to high-income taxpayers , the US tax system has become considerably less progressive . 
The US needs fiscal measures that both curb the deficit and contain rising income inequality - and the inequality of opportunity that it begets . 
But how should additional revenues be raised from top taxpayers to achieve these two goals ? 
Most economists believe that increasing revenues by reforming the tax code and broadening the tax base is &quot; probably &quot; better for the economy &apos;s long-term growth than raising income-tax rates . 
The analytical case for this belief is strong , but the empirical evidence is weak . 
In theory , higher marginal tax rates have well known negative effects - they reduce private incentives to work , save , and invest . 
Yet most empirical studies conclude that , at least within the range of income-tax rates in the US during the last several decades , these effects are negligible . 
A recent Congressional Research Service report , withdrawn under pressure from Congressional Republicans , found that changes in the top income-tax rate and the rate on capital gains had no discernible effect on economic growth during the last half-century . 
A recent review of the economic literature by three distinguished academics found no convincing evidence that real economic activity responds materially to tax-rate changes on top income earners , although such changes do affect their tax-avoidance behavior . 
So Obama has evidence on his side when he says that allowing the tax cuts for high-income taxpayers to expire at the end of the year will not affect economic growth . 
Republicans have proposed tax reforms in lieu of rate hikes on high-income taxpayers to raise revenues for deficit reduction . 
Obama has signaled that he is willing to consider this approach , provided it increases tax revenues from the top 2-3 % by at least the same amount as higher rates while protecting other taxpayers . 
The federal tax system is certainly in need of reform . 
Tax expenditures - which include all deductions , credits , and loopholes - account for about 8 % of GDP . 
Indeed , the US tax code is riddled with special preferences and contains large differences in effective tax rates across individuals and economic activities . 
These differences distort decisions about investment allocation and financing . 
Reforms that made the tax system simpler , fairer , and less distortionary would have a beneficial effect on economic growth , although economists concede that the size of this effect is uncertain and impossible to quantify . 
Because tax expenditures are so large , limiting them could raise a significant amount of additional revenue that could be used both for deficit reduction and to finance across-the-board cuts in income-tax rates . 
Analysis of the Simpson-Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin deficit-reduction plans by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center confirms that this approach is arithmetically feasible . 
Reducing large regressive tax expenditures like preferential tax rates for capital gains and dividends and deductions for state and local taxes , and replacing deductions with progressive tax credits , could generate enough revenue to finance rate cuts for all taxpayers , increase the tax code &apos;s overall progressivity , and contribute meaningfully to deficit reduction . 
But the odds of such an outcome are very low : what is arithmetically feasible is unlikely to be politically possible . 
Efforts to cap popular tax expenditures will encounter strong opposition from Republicans and Democrats alike . 
Nonetheless , some tax reforms are likely to be a key component of a bipartisan deficit-reduction deal , because they provide Republicans who oppose increases in tax rates for high-income taxpayers with an ideologically preferable way to increase revenue from them . 
Unfortunately , it will take time to negotiate tax reforms - more time than remains until the end of the year , when the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are scheduled to expire for all taxpayers . 
But there is still time to negotiate an agreement that extends these cuts for the bottom 98 % , and that contains temporary measures to cap deductions and credits for high-income taxpayers in 2013 . 
Such an agreement could help to break the political impasse over whether and how much these taxpayers &quot; rates should rise next year , thereby preventing the US from falling over the fiscal cliff and back into recession .
