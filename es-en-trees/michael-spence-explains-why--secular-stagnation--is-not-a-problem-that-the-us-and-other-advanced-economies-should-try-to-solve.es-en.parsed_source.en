The Real Challenges to Growth 
MILAN - Advanced economies &quot; experience since the 2008 financial crisis has spurred a rapidly evolving discussion of growth , employment , and income inequality . 
That should come as no surprise : For those who expected a relatively rapid post-crisis recovery , the more things stay the same , the more they change . 
Soon after the near-collapse of the financial system , the consensus view in favor of a reasonably normal cyclical recovery faded as the extent of balance-sheet damage - and the effect of deleveraging on domestic demand - became evident . 
In the United States , GDP growth remains well below what , until recently , had been viewed as its potential rate , and growth in Europe is negligible . 
Employment remains low and is lagging GDP growth , a pattern that began at least three recessions ago and that has become more pronounced with each recovery . 
In most advanced economies , the tradable sector has generated very limited job growth - a problem that , until 2008 , domestic demand &quot; solved &quot; by employing lots of people in the non-tradable sector ( government , health care , construction , and retail ) . 
Meanwhile , the adverse trends in income distribution both preceded the crisis and have survived it . 
In the US , the gap between the mean ( per capita ) income and the median income has grown to more than $ 20,000 . 
The income gains from GDP growth have been mostly concentrated in the upper quartile of the distribution . 
Prior to the crisis , the wealth effect produced by high asset prices mitigated downward pressure on consumption , just as low interest rates and quantitative easing since 2008 have produced substantial gains in asset prices that , given weak economic performance , probably will not last . 
The growing concentration of wealth , together with highly uneven educational quality , is contributing to declines in intergenerational economic mobility , in turn threatening social and political cohesion . 
Though causality is elusive , there has historically been a high correlation between inequality and political polarization , which is one reason why successful developing-country growth strategies have relied heavily on inclusiveness . 
Labor-saving technology and shifting employment patterns in the global economy &apos;s tradable sector are important drivers of inequality . 
Routine white- and blue-collar jobs are disappearing , while lower-value-added employment in the tradable sector is moving to a growing set of developing economies . 
These powerful twin forces have upset the long-run equilibrium in advanced economies &quot; labor markets , with too much education and too many skills invested in an outmoded growth pattern . 
All of this is causing distress , consternation , and confusion . 
First , expectations are or have been out of line with reality . 
It takes time for the full impact of deleveraging , structural rebalancing , and restoring shortfalls in tangible and intangible assets via investment to manifest itself . 
In the meantime , those who are bearing the brunt of the transition costs - the unemployed and the young - need support , and those of us who are more fortunate should bear the costs . 
Otherwise , the stated intention of restoring inclusive growth patterns will lack credibility , undercutting the ability to make difficult but important choices . 
Second , achieving full potential growth requires that the widespread pattern of public-sector underinvestment be reversed . 
A shift from consumption-led to investment-led growth is crucial , and it has to start with the public sector . 
The best way to use the advanced countries &quot; remaining fiscal capacity is to restore public investment in the context of a credible multi-year stabilization plan . 
This is a much better path than one that relies on leverage , low interest rates , and elevated asset prices to stimulate domestic demand beyond its natural recovery level . 
Not all demand is created equal . 
We need to get the level up and the composition right . 
Third , in flexible economies like that of the US , an important structural shift toward external demand is already underway . 
Exports are growing rapidly ( outpacing import growth ) , owing to lower energy costs , new technologies that favor re-localization , and a declining real effective exchange rate ( nominal dollar deprecation combined with muted domestic wage and income growth and higher inflation in major developing-country trading partners ) . 
Eventually , these structural shifts will offset a lower ( and more sustainable ) level of consumption relative to income , unless inappropriate increases in domestic demand short-circuit the process . 
Fourth , economies with structural rigidities need to take steps to remove them . 
All economies must be adaptable to structural change in order to support growth , and flexibility becomes more important in altering defective growth patterns , because it affects the speed of recovery . 
Finally , leadership is required to build a consensus around a new growth model and the burden-sharing needed to implement it successfully . 
Many developing countries spend a lot of time in a stable , no-growth equilibrium , and then shift to a more positive one . 
There is nothing automatic about that . 
In all of the cases with which I am familiar , effective leadership was the catalyst . 
So , while we can expect a multi-year process of rebalancing and closing the gap between actual and potential growth , exactly how long it will take depends on policy choices and the speed of structural adjustment . 
In southern Europe , for example , the process will take longer , because there are more missing components of recovery in these countries . 
Of course , the technological and demographic factors that underpin potential growth ebb and flow over longer ( multi-decade ) timeframes ; and , regardless of whether the US and other advanced countries have entered a long-run period of secular decline , there really is no way to influence these forces . 
But the immediate issue confronting many economies is different : restoring a resilient and inclusive growth pattern that achieves whatever the trend in potential growth permits .
