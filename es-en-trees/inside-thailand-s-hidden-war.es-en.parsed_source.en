Inside Thailand &apos;s Hidden War 
LEEDS - Thailand &apos;s former prime minister , Chavalit Yongchaiyudh , recently ignited a furor when he proposed that the separatist campaign in his country &apos;s Muslim-majority southern provinces might be solved politically , with a form of self-rule . 
Thailand &apos;s ruling Democrat Party immediately called Chavalit &apos;s remarks &quot; traitorous . &quot; 
But recent developments surrounding Afghanistan &apos;s elections have highlighted the shortcomings of using military force alone to resolve a civil war . 
This precedent offers an important lesson for Thailand and other countries facing intractable insurgencies . 
As Arisotle put it , &quot; politics is the master science in the realm of action . &quot; 
In June 2006 , I sat in a village in southern Thailand &apos;s Yala province with several ordinary-looking young men who had taken part in extraordinary events . 
They had joined the militants who had attacked a dozen security checkpoints across three southern provinces on April 28 , 2004 . 
Armed mainly with machetes and kitchen knives , 106 attackers perished that day , 32 of them inside Pattani &apos;s historic Krue-Ze mosque , where they had taken refuge . 
Five members of the Thai security forces were also killed . 
None of the youths I talked to could give any clear explanation for their actions , except to say that an Islamic schoolteacher known as Ustadz So had recruited them into a shadowy militant movement . 
Ustadz So had taught them that Thai rule over this historically Malay region was illegitimate , that Thai officials were cruel and heartless , and that the time had come for the Muslim population to rise up and expel the Buddhist infidels . 
According to counter-insurgency expert David Kilcullen , the violence in Thailand &apos;s deep South - which has now claimed more than 3,500 lives - was some of the most intense in the world between 2004 and 2007 , &quot; second only to Iraq and Afghanistan during this period . &quot; 
Yet , despite such alarming levels of bloodshed , the insurgency has been under-reported and under-researched , barely registering on the international community &apos;s radar screen , largely because the conflict cannot be reduced to a sound bite-friendly narrative of identifiable bad guys and good guys . 
First , the militant movement itself has no name , operating in a highly decentralized manner through small local cells that operate relatively independently - what might be described as self-managed violence franchises . 
Thai political expert Chaiwat Satha-Anand has called the movement a &quot; network without a core . &quot; 
The lack of a defined enemy makes reporting on and understanding the conflict difficult for journalists , diplomats , and government officials . 
Second , outcomes are not predictable . 
On April 28 , 2004 , the insurgents &quot; primary targets were Buddhist members of the security forces , but most of those who died were Malay Muslims . 
The would-be perpetrators also became the primary victims . 
Some victims have been killed extra-judicially . 
The one group not targeted by anyone has been Westerners . 
Again , reporting such a messy story is a challenge ; most Western news editors have preferred to highlight Iraq and Afghanistan . 
A third factor is that the violence has become a marginal issue even within Thailand . 
The breaking news teams returned to Bangkok long ago , where a military coup , ongoing mass protests , and other big political stories have kept them busy ever since . 
And , because the violence tends to come in dribs and drabs - rarely since 2004 has any one day &apos;s casualties reached double figures - the South has never risen back up the news agenda . 
Many Thai military and police officials now privately admit that the insurgency cannot be defeated through security measures . 
After a dip in the number of incidents during late 2007 and 2008 , violence once again increased in 2009 . 
The military &apos;s belief that Malay Muslims could be re-educated and re-socialized into accepting a Thai identity has proved untenable . 
The same goes for earlier hard-line rhetoric about rooting out the militants and destroying their organization . 
The current government under Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva misses the point with rhetoric about creating peace simply through promoting justice , or by funding large-scale socio-economic development projects . 
Malay Muslims in Thailand &apos;s southern provinces are demanding their own political space . 
Few of them seriously believe that a tiny separate Patani state , wedged between Thailand and Malaysia , would be viable . 
What many are seeking is some form of special status within Thailand , enabling them to pursue their own cultural and religious traditions without interference from Bangkok . 
Until the Thai government grasps this simple point , young men like those I met in Yala will still be recruited into militant activity . 
As Chavalit Yongchaiyudh understands , the southern Thai conflict is a political problem in need of a political solution - just like Afghanistan and other more familiar wars .
