Russia &apos;s No-Participation Pact 
MOSCOW - The Russian government , with its solid hold on power , has invariably gotten away with poor performance , inefficiency , corruption , and widespread violation of political rights and civil liberties . 
Polls consistently demonstrate that the Russian people are not deluded : they routinely respond in surveys that government officials are corrupt and self-serving . 
More than 80 % of Russians , according to a poll conducted last summer , believe that &quot; many civil servants practically defy the law . &quot; 
And yet Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who still remains Russia &apos;s most powerful person despite his not holding the presidency , has enjoyed high and steady approval ratings for years . 
A mild drop in early 2011 probably reflected frustration over social injustice and a growing sense of insecurity and uncertainty about the future . 
Even so , roughly 70 % of respondents in a February poll said that they approved of Putin &apos;s performance . 
President Dmitri Medvedev &apos;s approval ratings are only slightly lower . 
Russian leaders &quot; high ratings do not , however , indicate a rational preference for the incumbents over potential contenders ; with political competition in Russia eviscerated , comparison and choice are not part of the political left . 
Rather , these poll numbers are a &quot; vote &quot; for the status quo ; they convey a broadly shared sense that political change is not desired , notwithstanding terrorist attacks , technological catastrophes , lawless police , or rigged elections . 
During the years of Putin &apos;s leadership , the Kremlin has steadily pushed citizens farther and farther from decision-making by virtually dismantling representative institutions . 
Gubernatorial elections were abolished six years ago , and even elected city mayors have been progressively replaced by appointed officials . 
Polls routinely indicate that more than 80 % of Russians believe that they can make no difference in national or even regional affairs . 
This system of political alienation is accepted by an overwhelming majority of Russians . 
The &quot; masses &quot; and the &quot; best and the brightest &quot; alike show no interest in political participation . 
Political opposition groups do not attract public support , which makes it easy for the government to suppress them . 
Indeed , in the absence of political participation , the government enjoys easy dominance over society . 
The perennial Russian order - the dominant state and a powerless , fragmented society - remains largely in place . 
Twice in the twentieth century , the omnipotent Russian state was dramatically weakened : at the beginning , when the Russian Empire collapsed , and at the end , when the USSR ceased to exist . 
Both times , however , the traditional pattern of state dominance was quickly reestablished . 
Although state-society relations in Russia hue to a traditional pattern , different leaderships have shaped them in different ways . 
Stalin &apos;s regime could be compared to a cruel , sadistic father who keeps his children in a state of fear and submission . 
Brezhnev &apos;s model resembled a bad marriage , exhausted of love or respect , in which the spouses constantly cheat , take advantage of each other , and grab each other &apos;s property , though the powerful husband occasionally reminds his wife that he is boss and demands at least a formal pledge of loyalty - or else . 
Compared to these two models , Putin &apos;s model of state-society relations looks like a divorce , or at least a separation : each side minds its own business and doesn &apos;t interfere with the other &apos;s sphere . 
It is a model best described as ano-participation pact.The Kremlin may have monopolized decision-making , but it is largely non-intrusive and enables citizens to live their own lives and pursue their own interests - as long as they do not encroach on the government realm . 
Unlike in the USSR , which massively infringed on citizens &quot; private space , today &apos;s Russians enjoy virtually unlimited individual freedoms . 
The non-intrusive nature of the government is appreciated : people eagerly engage in their private affairs - with little regard for the political realm , which they have willingly abandoned . 
Nevertheless , the last 20 years of broad individual freedom and limited civil liberties have generated shifts in Russian society - if not across the board , then certainly among certain groups . 
In particular , Russians have acquired some organizational and community-building skills . 
The use of online social networks , for example , has grown faster than in any other country in Europe , and has helped create some semblance of a public sphere , with the Russian blogosphere often a venue for angry public expression about social injustice , undeserved privileges , lawlessness , and police impunity . 
Socioeconomic protests have also become a feature of Russian life , especially during the economic crisis . 
Unlike political groups , which attract very limited public support , socioeconomic demands have repeatedly brought together thousands of people in various parts of the country . 
In big cities , moreover , anew urban class is emerging - advanced and modernized Russians with good professional skills who feel at ease in the globalized world . 
It is mostly due to this group that private charity has developed in recent years . 
But , despite opportunities for self-expression , community building and activism remain marginal and do not alter or weaken the state &apos;s dominance over society . 
Despite the recent rise in negative public sentiment , protest activity remains fragmented and invariably local in scope and demands . 
For now , at least , provincial Russians and the new urban class alike have accepted Putin &apos;s no-participation pact . 
In fact , should events turn out badly , critically-minded and well-informed urban achievers would be most likely to embrace the ultimate form of non-participation : emigration . 
In the current political climate , the more enlightened Russians would rather use their skills and talents for self-fulfillment abroad than be the driving force of Russia &apos;s modernization .
