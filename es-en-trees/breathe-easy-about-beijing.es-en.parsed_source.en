Breathe Easy About Beijing 
Images of the Beijing skyline seemingly bathed in a soup of smog and haze have been a common sight on the world &apos;s TV screens in recent days and weeks . 
Foreign journalists with hand-held air pollution detectors have been popping up on street corners checking levels of soot and dust . 
Everyone seems keen to prove that the city &apos;s air will be a decisive and debilitating factor for one of the world &apos;s most high-profile sporting events . 
Without doubt Beijing is facing a huge challenge . 
There are real and understandable concerns for the health of competitors , especially those in endurance and long-distance events such as cycling and the marathon . 
But the current frenzied focus is marked by considerable amnesia . 
After all , air pollution was a major concern in Los Angeles 24 years ago , though few now seem to recall the dramatic scene at the end of the women &apos;s marathon , when the Swiss competitor was seen staggering and stumbling from exhaustion , the heat , and , perhaps , the effects of air pollution . 
And air quality was also an issue for subsequent Olympic Games in Barcelona , Atlanta , Seoul , and Athens . 
So the debate about the Beijing Games deserves more fair play than it has received . 
Indeed , real and , one hopes , long-lasting achievements have been made by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games , the city as a whole , the government , and the six provinces concerned . 
This is all the more remarkable when set against the city &apos;s double-digit economic growth and the fact that the Games are being staged in a developing country , with all the social , economic , health , and environmental challenges this entails . 
For example , some 200 polluting factories have been closed , switched to new kinds of cleaner production , or moved out of the city over the past seven years . 
Moreover , as a result of a $ 17 billion investment , more than 90 % of the city &apos;s wastewater is now treated , more than 50 % of the city is forested , and natural gas accounts for more than 60 % of energy generation , up from roughly 45 % in 2000 . 
Meanwhile , eight new railway lines , covering 200 kilometers and with a daily capacity of close to four million people , have become operational this year , alongside 60 kilometers of bus lines . 
New vehicle emission standards meet the most stringent equivalent European standards , and are higher than in the United States . 
In addition , 50,000 old taxis and 10,000 buses have been replaced , and 4,000 of the new buses are powered by natural gas - now the largest fleet of its kind in the world . 
In recent days , the authorities have also requested businesses to stagger the working day before , during , and after the Games to reduce traffic volumes , alongside a raft of other traffic-cutting measures . 
Then there is the attention to eco-detail at the Olympic venues themselves , including the 400,000-square meter Olympic Village , where water reclaimed from the Qinghe sewage treatment plant is being used for heating and cooling systems , resulting in an estimated 60 % savings in electricity consumption . 
Only time will tell if all these measures will bring air pollution down to acceptable levels . 
The United Nations Environment Program will certainly make this a focus of its post-Games report , building on the initial one issued in 2007 . 
But it is clear that Beijing is striving to be part of the Green Team , embracing environmental standards that are now central to the modern Olympic movement , and that are increasingly part of other big sporting events , such as the Green Goals for the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups . 
Increased public awareness , the ability to showcase new and more sustainable ways of managing an urban setting , and the legacy of more environmentally friendly energy , transport systems , and other infrastructure should also not be underestimated . 
Humanity is currently engaged in a far-reaching and urgent competition that pits the need to embed a twenty-first century &quot; green economy &quot; against the rapid implosion of our climate and natural life-support systems . 
The catalytic and inspirational possibilities of events like the Olympics thus have a wider role to play , one that might just help prevent us from staggering and collapsing under the weight of our environmental degradation .
