A Berlin Consensus ? 
HONG KONG - A recent trip to Berlin brought back memories of an earlier visit in the summer of 1967 , when I was a poor student who marveled at the Wall that would divide and devastate an entire society for another two decades . 
Berlin today is vibrant and rejuvenated , rebuilt by the German peoples &apos; hard work and sacrifice to unify the country , and an apt setting for the conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking ( INET ) , which I was there to attend . 
The conference &apos;s theme was &quot; Paradigm Lost , &quot; with more than 300 economists , political scientists , systems analysts , and ecologists gathering to rethink economic and political theory for the challenges and uncertainty posed by growing inequality , rising unemployment , global financial disarray , and climate change . 
Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was broken , but there was no agreement on what can replace it . 
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen attributed the European crisis to four failures - political , economic , social , and intellectual . 
The global financial crisis , which began in 2007 as a crisis of US subprime lending and has broadened into a European sovereign-debt ( and banking ) crisis , has raised questions that we cannot answer , owing to over-specialization and fragmentation of knowledge . 
And yet there is no denying that the world has become too intricate for any simple , overarching theory to explain complex economic , technological , demographic , and environmental shifts . 
In particular , the rise of emerging markets has challenged traditional Western deductive and inductive logic . 
Deductive inference enables us to predict effects if we know the principles ( the rule ) and the cause . 
By inductive reasoning , if we know the cause and effects , we can infer the principles . 
Eastern thinking , by contrast , has been abductive , moving from pragmatism to guessing the next steps . 
Abductive inference is pragmatic , looking only at outcomes , guessing at the rule , and identifying the cause . 
Like history , social-scientific theory is written by the victors and shaped by the context and challenges of its time . 
Free-market thinking evolved from Anglo-Saxon theorists ( many from Scotland ) , who migrated and colonized territories , allowing fortunate individuals to assume that there were no limits to consumption . 
European continental thinking , responding to urbanization and the need for social order , emphasized institutional analysis of political economy . 
Thus , the emergence of neoclassical economics in the nineteenth century was very much influenced by Newtonian and Cartesian physics , moving from qualitative analysis to quantifying human behavior by assuming rational behavior and excluding uncertainty . 
This &quot; predetermined equilibrium &quot; thinking - reflected in the view that markets always self-correct - led to policy paralysis until the Great Depression , when John Maynard Keynes &apos;s argument for government intervention to address unemployment and output gaps gained traction . 
By the 1970 &quot; s , the neoclassical general-equilibrium school captured Keynesian economics through real-sector models that assumed that &quot; finance is a veil , &quot; thereby becoming blind to financial markets &quot; destabilizing effects . 
Economists like Hyman Minsky , who tried to correct this , were largely ignored as Milton Friedman and others led the profession &apos;s push for free markets and minimal government intervention . 
But then technology , demographics , and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the neoclassical approach could not foresee . 
Even as the world &apos;s advanced countries over-consumed through leveraging from derivative finance , four billion of the world &apos;s seven billion people began moving to middle-income status , making huge demands on global resources and raising the issue of ecological sustainability . 
New thinking is required to manage these massive and systemic changes , as well as the integration of giants like China and India into the modern world . 
A change of mindset is needed not just in the West , but also in the East . 
In 1987 , the historian Ray Huang explained it for China : 
&quot; As the world enters the modern era , most countries under internal and external pressure need to reconstruct themselves by substituting the mode of governance rooted in agrarian experience with a new set of rules based on commerce .... This is easier said than done . 
The renewal process could affect the top and bottom layers , and inevitably it is necessary to recondition the institutional links between them . 
Comprehensive destruction is often the order ; and it may take decades to bring the work to completion . &quot; 
Using this macro-historical framework , we can see Japanese deflation , European debt , and even the Arab Spring as phases of systemic changes within complex structures that are interacting with one another in a new , multipolar global system . 
We are witnessing simultaneous global convergence ( the narrowing of income , wealth , and knowledge gaps between countries ) and local divergence ( widening income , wealth , and knowledge gaps within countries ) . 
Adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evolve . 
As the philosopher Bertrand Russell presciently put it : &quot; Security and justice require centralized governmental control , which must extend to the creation of a world government if it is to be effective . 
Progress , on the contrary , requires the utmost scope for personal initiative that is compatible with social order . &quot; 
A new wave of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called &quot; creative destruction &quot; is under way : even as central banks struggle to maintain stability by flooding markets with liquidity , credit to business and households is shrinking . 
We live in an age of simultaneous fear of inflation and deflation ; of unprecedented prosperity amid growing inequality ; and of technological advancement and resource depletion . 
Meanwhile , existing political systems promise good jobs , sound governance , a sustainable environment , and social harmony without sacrifice - a paradise of self-interested free riders that can be sustained only by sacrificing the natural environment and the welfare of future generations . 
We cannot postpone the pain of adjustment forever by printing money . 
Sustainability can be achieved only when the haves become willing to sacrifice for the have-nots . 
The Washington Consensus of free-market reforms for developing countries ended more than two decades ago . 
The INET conference in Berlin showed the need for a new one - a consensus that supports sacrifice in the interest of unity . 
Europe could use it .
