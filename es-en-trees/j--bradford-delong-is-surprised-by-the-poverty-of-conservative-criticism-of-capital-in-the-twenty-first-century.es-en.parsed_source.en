The Right &apos;s Piketty Problem 
BERKELEY - In the online journal The Baffler , Kathleen Geier recently attempted a roundup of conservative criticism of Thomas Piketty &apos;s new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century . 
Piketty &apos;s argument is detailed and complicated . 
But five points seem particularly salient : 
1 . 
A society &apos;s wealth relative to its annual income will grow ( or shrink ) to a level equal to its net savings rate divided by its growth rate . 
2 . 
Time and chance inevitably lead to the concentration of wealth in the hands of a relatively small group : call them &quot; the rich . &quot; 
3 . 
The economy &apos;s growth rate falls as the low-hanging fruit of industrialization is picked ; meanwhile , the net savings rate rises , owing to a rollback of progressive taxation , the end of the chaotic destruction of the first half of the twentieth century , and the absence of compelling sociological reasons for the rich to spend their incomes or their wealth rather than save it . 
4 . 
A society in which the rich have a very high degree of economic , political , and sociocultural influence is an unpleasant society in many ways . 
5 . 
A society in which the wealth-to-annual-income ratio is a very large multiple of the growth rate is one in which control over wealth falls to heirs - what Geier elsewhere has called an &quot; heiristocracy &quot; ; such a society is even more unpleasant in many ways than one dominated by a meritocratic and entrepreneurial rich elite . 
Now , even in thumbnail form , this is a complicated argument . 
As a result , one would expect that it would attract a large volume of substantive criticism . 
And , indeed , Matt Rognlie has attacked ( 4 ) , arguing that the return on wealth varies inversely with the wealth-to-annual-income ratio so strongly that , paradoxically , the more wealth the rich have , the lower their share of total income . 
Tyler Cowen of George Mason University , echoing Friedrich von Hayek , has argued against ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . 
The &quot; idle rich , &quot; according to Cowen , are a valuable cultural resource precisely because they form a leisured aristocracy . 
It is only because they are not bound to the karmic wheel of earning , getting , and spending on necessities and conveniences that they can take the long and / or heterodox view of things and create , say , great art . 
Still others have waved their hands and hoped for a new industrial revolution that will create more low-hanging fruit and be accompanied by another wave of creative destruction . 
Should that happen , more upward mobility will be possible , thus negating ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . 
But the extraordinary thing about the conservative criticism of Piketty &apos;s book is how little of it has developed any of these arguments , and how much of it has been devoted to a furious denunciation of its author &apos;s analytical abilities , motivation , and even nationality . 
Clive Crook , for example , argues that &quot; the limits of the data &#91; Piketty &#93; presents and the grandiosity of the conclusions he draws ... borders on schizophrenia , &quot; rendering conclusions that are &quot; either unsupported or contradicted by &#91; his &#93; own data and analysis . &quot; 
And it is &quot; Piketty &apos;s terror at rising inequality , &quot; Crook speculates , that has led him astray . 
Meanwhile , James Pethokoukis thinks that Piketty &apos;s work can be reduced to a tweet : &quot; Karl Marx wasn &apos;t wrong , just early . 
Pretty much . 
Sorry , capitalism . # inequalityforevah . &quot; 
And then there is Allan Meltzer &apos;s puerile accusation of excessive Frenchness . 
France has , for many years , implemented destructive policies of income redistribution . &quot; 
Combining these strands of conservative criticism , the real problem with Piketty &apos;s book becomes clear : its author is a mentally unstable foreign communist . 
This revives an old line of attack on the US right , one that destroyed thousands of lives and careers during the McCarthy era . 
But the depiction of ideas as being somehow &quot; un-American &quot; has always been an epithet , not an argument . 
Now , in center-left American communities like Berkeley , California , where I live and work , Piketty &apos;s book has been received with praise bordering on reverence . 
We are impressed with the amount of work that he and his colleagues have put into collecting , assembling , and cleaning the data ; the intelligence and skill with which he has constructed and presented his arguments ; and how much blood Arthur Goldhammer sweated over the translation . 
To be sure , everyone disagrees with 10-20 % of Piketty &apos;s argument , and everyone is unsure about perhaps another 10-20 % . 
But , in both cases , everyone has a different 10-20 % . 
In other words , there is majority agreement that each piece of the book is roughly correct , which means that there is near-consensus that the overall argument of the book is , broadly , right . 
Unless Piketty &apos;s right-wing critics step up their game and actually make some valid points , that will be the default judgment on his book .
