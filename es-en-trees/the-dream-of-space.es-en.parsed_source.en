The Dream of Space 
More than 50 years ago , visionaries like the British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke and the German ( and American ) rocket engineer Wernher von Braun laid out a series of steps for the journey into space . 
Clark presented his vision in a 1951 book The Exploration of Space and von Braun &apos;s proposals appeared in a series of Collier &apos;s magazine articles published between 1952 and 1954 . 
A few years later - indeed , 50 years ago this week - the Soviet Union launched the first earth orbiting satellite , inaugurating the space age . 
After 50 years , many elements of the original vision have been achieved , some have failed , and there have been more than a few surprises . 
Clarke and von Braun encountered a wall of skepticism when their proposals first appeared . 
The public viewed space travel as science fiction , a form of popular entertainment thought to have little chance of realization . 
But Clarke , von Braun , and others persevered . 
We would , they predicted , launch satellites , dispatch humans on orbital flights , assemble a large earth-orbiting space station , build reusable space shuttles , construct space telescopes , and send humans to the moon , Venus , and Mars . 
Clarke explained how humans could build communication satellites . 
Von Braun predicted that military forces would use orbiting platforms to observe troop movements and prevent surprise attacks . 
All of these visions appeared before the first artificial satellite was launched . 
In 1959 , officials at the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) adopted most of these steps as part of their long-range plan . 
The Soviet Union engaged the US in a race to the moon . 
Government support for realizing the vision inspired the British film maker Stanley Kubrick to present the steps in his classic movie 2001 : A Space Odyssey , released in 1968 . 
Clarke helped to write the screenplay . 
The movie depicted a large space station , a winged space shuttle , a lunar base , and astronauts on a trip to the outer solar system . 
True to the plan , humans built scientific satellites , communication satellites , reconnaissance or &quot; spy &quot; satellites , space stations , and reusable space shuttles . 
They sent robotic spacecraft to the moon , Venus , Mars , and other planets , and humans to the moon . 
In those respects , the original vision was achieved . 
The human space effort , nonetheless , departed from the plan in unexpected ways . 
The International Space Station , currently under construction , does not resemble the large , rotating wheels presented by Kubrick , Clarke , and von Braun . 
Early planners viewed the space station as an assembly point for expeditions to the moon and planets . 
Kubrick &apos;s 900-foot wide wheel rotated in such a fashion as to produce a sense of gravity equal to that felt on the moon , to which many of the station &apos;s fictional occupants were bound . 
The real space station is a micro-gravity research laboratory with no capability to launch trips to the moon or beyond . 
Larger capabilities were part of the original space station plan , approved in 1984 , but subsequently disappeared as the cost of the facility grew . 
Nor has the US space shuttle accomplished its goals . 
Von Braun predicted that the US would need to launch 364 space shuttles in less than one year to prepare for the first lunar voyage . 
When the space shuttle was approved in 1972 , NASA officials predicted that they would launch one every week or two . 
But the space shuttle has proven far more difficult and costly to operate than anticipated , flying only four times per year on average . 
It has neither reduced the cost of space access nor made space flight safe and routine , as promised . 
When the shuttle is retired around 2010 , NASA will replace it with an old-fashioned spacecraft with no wings at all . 
In contrast to human space flight , which has lagged behind expectations , the robotic space effort has exceeded them . 
Von Braun endorsed an automated telescope in space , but thought that astronauts would need to visit the instrument to change the film . 
Early plans for military reconnaissance stations assumed that soldiers would be stationed on board . 
Clarke believed that astronauts would be dispatched to maintain and operate communication satellites . 
Kubrick suggested that people - accompanied by a computer - would pilot spacecraft to explore planets like Jupiter and Saturn . 
But none of this proved necessary , owing to remarkable advances in robotics , solid-state electronics , imaging , data collection , and communication . 
Sensors that convert light waves into electronic signals eliminated the need for film on space telescopes , while computer chip technology ( integrated circuits ) allowed communication satellites to be operated without periodic human repair . 
Robotic spacecraft are currently returning information from the outer regions of the solar system and roving the surface of Mars . 
No military force has yet perceived the need to station soldiers on its various reconnaissance , communication , or navigation satellites . 
Robotic technology is advancing more rapidly than the technologies supporting human space flight . 
Around the world , clever scientists , engineers , and entrepreneurs are working to realize the remainder of the space exploration dream . 
Watch for humans to establish space tourism , return to the moon , and attempt an expedition to Mars . 
Advances in robotics will continue to occur , with automated spacecraft that can dig and swim , and telescopes that can look for earth-like planets around nearby stars . 
If the past is any guide , much of what seems like science fiction today will become reality tomorrow .
