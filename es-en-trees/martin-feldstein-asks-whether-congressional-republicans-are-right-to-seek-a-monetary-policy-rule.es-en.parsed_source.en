Fighting the Fed 
CAMBRIDGE - The US Federal Reserve is battling with members of Congress over a proposed law , the Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act , that would require the Fed to use a formal rule to guide monetary policy . 
The Fed fears that the law would limit its independence , while the bill &apos;s proponents argue that it would produce more predictable growth with low inflation . 
Who is right ? 
In order to understand the conflict , it is useful to compare the Fed &apos;s independence with that of the Bank of England and the European Central Bank . 
In Britain , the BoE has &quot; instrument independence &quot; but not &quot; target independence . &quot; 
The head of the Treasury sets a goal for the inflation rate and leaves it to the BoE to decide which policies will achieve that goal . 
If the target is missed by more than one percentage point on either side , the BoE &apos;s governor must send an open letter to the head of the Treasury explaining why ( and what the Bank proposes to do about it ) . 
By contrast , the Maastricht Treaty tasked the ECB with maintaining &quot; price stability , &quot; but left it free to provide its own operational definition . 
The ECB defined price stability to be annual inflation of less than but close to 2 % . 
Given the structure of the European Monetary Union , there is no government oversight of the ECB , which thus has both &quot; target independence &quot; and &quot; instrument independence , &quot; though restrictions preclude specific policies . 
The Fed is &quot; independent , &quot; but only in a very special sense : vis-Ã -vis the government &apos;s executive branch . 
While the US president can instruct administrative agencies like the Commerce Department or the Treasury Department to take specific actions ( as long as they do not conflict with valid legislation ) , the administration cannot tell the Fed how to manage interest rates , reserve requirements , or any other aspects of monetary policy . 
But , though the Fed is independent of the White House , it is not independent of Congress . 
The Fed was created by Congressional legislation that now stipulates a &quot; dual mandate &quot; of price stability and maximum employment . 
It is up to the Fed to formulate operational definitions of these goals and the policies it will pursue to achieve them . 
The proposed legislation would affect both &quot; target &quot; and &quot; instrument &quot; independence . 
The Fed decided to define price stability as a &quot; two percent annual inflation over the medium term of the price index of consumer expenditures . &quot; 
For the past 12 months , that rate of increase has been about 1.5 % . 
While full employment has not been defined , many economists believe it is equivalent to an unemployment rate of about 5.5 % . 
The most recent rate was 6.1 % . 
Reflecting the fear that the Fed &apos;s current policy of sustained low interest rates will lead to higher inflation , the law would require the Fed to adopt a formal procedure for setting its key short-term interest rate , the &quot; federal funds rate . &quot; 
More specifically , the law suggests a specific interest-rate rule ( the Reference Policy Rule ) while giving the Fed the opportunity to adopt a different rule if it explains to Congress why it prefers the alternative . 
The Reference Policy Rule is essentially the rule first proposed in 1993 by John Taylor of Stanford University , based on his statistical estimate of what the Fed appeared to have been doing under Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan during a period of both low inflation and low unemployment . 
It states that the federal funds rate should be 2 % plus the current inflation rate plus one-half of the difference between current and target inflation and one-half of the percentage difference between current and full-employment GDP . 
All of this implies that if the economy is at full employment and targeted inflation , the federal funds rate should equal 2 % plus the rate of inflation . 
Given uncertainty about the level of full-employment GDP , this rule still leaves the Fed substantial discretion . 
The Fed could argue that the gap between current and full-employment GDP is larger than the 6.1 % unemployment rate implies , owing to the large number of part-time workers who would prefer full-time employment and the sharp decline in the labor force participation rate . 
If the GDP gap is 4 % , as a recent Congressional Budget Office estimate implied , the Taylor rule would indicate an optimal federal funds rate of about 1.25 % ( 2 + 1.5 - 0.25 - 2 ) , compared to the current rate of only 0.1 % . 
While the federal funds rate may be heading to 1 % over the next 12 or 18 months , by then the narrowing GDP gap will imply an even higher Taylor-rule interest rate . 
Instead , the Fed will be focusing on the interest rate on excess reserves . 
The proposed legislation is full of excessive and impossible requirements , and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives may not be able to pass it , even in modified form . 
Even if it does , it will not get through the Democratic-controlled Senate . 
He or she might veto it , but a Republican president after the 2016 election might not . 
The Fed no doubt fears that if the principle of requiring a formal rule is accepted , Congress could tighten the requirement , forcing a more restrictive monetary policy . 
That is why the new Fed chair , Janet Yellen , forcefully opposed such legislation in recent congressional testimony . 
One thing is certain : The bill will put pressure on the Fed to pay more attention to inflation , avoiding a persistent rate above its own 2 % target . 
Otherwise , the Fed &apos;s operational independence could be restricted , forcing it to focus its policies more sharply on its inflation mandate .
