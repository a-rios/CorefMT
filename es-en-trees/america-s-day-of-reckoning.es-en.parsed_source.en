America &apos;s Day of Reckoning 
The pessimists who have long forecasted that America &apos;s economy was in for trouble finally seem to be coming into their own . 
Of course , there is no glee in seeing stock prices tumble as a result of soaring mortgage defaults . 
But it was largely predictable , as are the likely consequences for both the millions of Americans who will be facing financial distress and the global economy . 
The story goes back to the recession of 2001 . 
With the support of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , President George W. Bush pushed through a tax cut designed to benefit the richest Americans but not to lift the economy out of the recession that followed the collapse of the Internet bubble . 
Given that mistake , the Fed had little choice if it was to fulfill its mandate to maintain growth and employment : it had to lower interest rates , which it did in an unprecedented way - all the way down to 1 % . 
It worked , but in a way fundamentally different from how monetary policy normally works . 
Usually , low interest rates lead firms to borrow more to invest more , and greater indebtedness is matched by more productive assets . 
But , given that overinvestment in the 1990 &quot; s was part of the problem underpinning the recession , lower interest rates did not stimulate much investment . 
The economy grew , but mainly because American families were persuaded to take on more debt , refinancing their mortgages and spending some of the proceeds . 
And , as long as housing prices rose as a result of lower interest rates , Americans could ignore their growing indebtedness . 
In fact , even this did not stimulate the economy enough . 
To get more people to borrow more money , credit standards were lowered , fueling growth in so-called &quot; subprime &quot; mortgages . 
Moreover , new products were invented , which lowered upfront payments , making it easier for individuals to take bigger mortgages . 
Some mortgages even had negative amortization : payments did not cover the interest due , so every month the debt grew more . 
Fixed mortgages , with interest rates at 6 % , were replaced with variable-rate mortgages , whose interest payments were tied to the lower short-term T-bill rates . 
What were called &quot; teaser rates &quot; allowed even lower payments for the first few years : they were teasers , because they played off the fact that many borrowers were not financially sophisticated , and didn &apos;t really understand what they were getting into . 
And Alan Greenspan egged them to pile on the risk by encouraging these variable-rate mortgages . 
On February 23 , 2004 , he pointed out that &quot; many homeowners might have saved tens of thousands of dollars had they held adjustable-rate mortgages rather than fixed-rate mortgages during the past decade . &quot; 
But did Greenspan really expect interest rates to remain permanently at 1 % - a negative real interest rate ? 
Did he not think about what would happen to poor Americans with variable-rate mortgages if interest rates rose , as they almost surely would ? 
Of course , Greenspan &apos;s behavior meant that under his watch , the economy performed better than it otherwise would have . 
But it was only a matter of time before that performance became unsustainable . 
Fortunately , most Americans did not follow Greenspan &apos;s advice to switch to variable-rate mortgages . 
But even as short-term interest rates began to rise , the day of reckoning was postponed , as new borrowers could obtain fixed-rate mortgages at interest rates that were not increasing . 
Remarkably , as short-term interest rates rose , medium- and long-term interest rates did not , something that was referred to as a &quot; conundrum . &quot; 
One hypothesis is that foreign central banks that were accumulating trillions of dollars finally figured out that they were likely to be holding these reserves for years to come , and could afford to put at least some of the money into medium-term US treasury notes yielding ( initially ) far higher returns than T-bills . 
The housing price bubble eventually broke , and , with prices declining , some have discovered that their mortgages are larger than the value of their house . 
Others found that as interest rates rose , they simply could not make their payments . 
Too many Americans built no cushion into their budgets , and mortgage companies , focusing on the fees generated by new mortgages , did not encourage them to do so . 
Just as the collapse of the real estate bubble was predictable , so are its consequences : housing starts and sales of existing homes are down and housing inventories are up . 
By some reckonings , more than two-thirds of the increase in output and employment over the past six years has been real estate-related , reflecting both new housing and households borrowing against their homes to support a consumption binge . 
The housing bubble induced Americans to live beyond their means - net savings has been negative for the past couple of years . 
With this engine of growth turned off , it is hard to see how the American economy will not suffer from a slowdown . 
A return to fiscal sanity will be good in the long run , but it will reduce aggregate demand in the short run . 
There is an old adage about how people &apos;s mistakes continue to live long after they are gone . 
That is certainly true of Greenspan . 
In Bush &apos;s case , we are beginning to bear the consequences even before he has departed .
