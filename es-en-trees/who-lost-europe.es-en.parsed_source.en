Who Lost Europe ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Financial meltdown has been averted in Europe - for now . 
But the future of the European Union and the fate of the eurozone still hang in the balance . 
If Europe doesn &apos;t find a way to reactivate the continent &apos;s economy soon , it will be doomed to years of gloom and endless mutual recrimination about &quot; who sabotaged the European project . &quot; 
Having suffered a deeper economic collapse in 2009 than the United States did , Europe &apos;s economy is poised for a much more sluggish recovery - if one can call it that . 
The International Monetary Fund expects the eurozone to expand by only 1 % this year and 1.5 % in 2011 , compared to 3.1 and 2.6 % for the US . 
Even Japan , in a deep slump since the 1990 &quot; s , is expected to grow faster than Europe . 
European growth is constrained by debt problems and continued concerns about the solvency of Greece and other highly indebted EU members . 
As the private sector deleverages and attempts to rebuild its balance sheets , consumption and investment demand have collapsed , bringing output down with them . 
European leaders have so far offered no solution to the growth conundrum other than belt tightening . 
The reasoning seems to be that growth requires market confidence , which in turn requires fiscal retrenchment . 
As Angela Merkel puts it , &quot; growth can &apos;t come at the price of high state budget deficits . &quot; 
But trying to redress budget deficits in the midst of a collapse in domestic demand makes problems worse , not better . 
A shrinking economy makes private and public debt look less sustainable , which does nothing for market confidence . 
In fact , it sets in motion a vicious cycle . 
The poorer an economy &apos;s growth prospects , the larger the fiscal correction and deleveraging needed to convince markets of underlying solvency . 
But the greater the fiscal correction and private-sector deleveraging , the worse growth prospects become . 
The best way to get rid of debt ( short of default ) is to grow out of it . 
So Europe needs a short-term growth strategy to supplement its financial-support package and its plans for fiscal consolidation . 
The greatest obstacle to implementing such a strategy is the EU &apos;s largest economy and its putative leader : Germany . 
Even though its fiscal and external accounts are strong , Germany has resisted calls for boosting its domestic demand further . 
Its fiscal policy has been expansionary , but nowhere near the level of the US . 
Germany &apos;s structural fiscal deficit has increased by 3.8 percentage points of GDP since 2007 , compared to 6.1 percentage points in the US . 
What makes this perverse is that Germany runs a huge current-account surplus . 
Projected to amount to 5.5 % of GDP in 2010 , this surplus is not far behind China &apos;s 6.2 % . 
So Germany has to thank deficit countries like the US , or Spain and Greece in Europe , for propping up its industries and preventing its unemployment rate from rising further . 
For a wealthy economy that is supposed to contribute to global economic stability , Germany is not only failing to do its fair share , but is free-riding on other countries &quot; economies . 
It is Germany &apos;s partners in the eurozone , especially badly hit countries like Greece and Spain , that bear the brunt of the costs . 
These countries &quot; combined current-account deficit matches Germany &apos;s surplus almost exactly . ( The eurozone &apos;s aggregate current account with the rest of the world is balanced . ) 
The traditional remedy for countries caught in the kind of crisis that Spain , Greece , Portugal , and Ireland find themselves in is to combine fiscal retrenchment with currency depreciation . 
The latter gives the economy a quick shot of competitiveness , improves the external balance , and reduces the output loss and unemployment that accompany fiscal cutbacks . 
But eurozone membership deprives these countries of this powerful tool , and depreciation of the euro itself is of limited benefit since so much of their trade ( around 50 % ) is with Germany and other eurozone members . 
There are few other tools at hand . 
There is the usual call from international organizations and some economists for &quot; structural reforms , &quot; which in this context largely means increasing firms &quot; ability to fire workers . 
Whatever long-term benefits such reforms might bring , it is difficult to see how they would provide immediate benefits . 
Reducing the cost of firing workers will not increase demand for labor much when no one wants to hire new workers . 
Short of dropping out of the eurozone , the only real option available to Greece , Spain , and the others to boost competitiveness is to engineer a one-time across-the-board reduction in nominal wages and prices for utilities and services . 
This is a difficult task under the most favorable circumstances . 
The European Central Bank &apos;s low inflation target ( 2 % ) renders it virtually impossible , as it implies requisite downward adjustment in wages and prices of 10 % or more . 
So Germany &apos;s refusal to boost domestic demand and reduce its external surplus , along with its insistence on conservative inflation targets for the ECB , severely undercuts prospects for European prosperity and unity . 
It virtually guarantees that Greece , Spain , and others with large private and public debts will be condemned to years of economic decline and high unemployment . 
At some point , these countries may well choose to default on their external obligations rather than endure the pain . 
Germany &apos;s leaders may take comfort in lecturing other governments about their profligacy . 
And it is true that some , like the Greek government , ran too-high deficits during the good times and endangered their future . 
But what about Spain or Ireland , where the borrowers were not the government but the private sector ? 
If others borrowed too much , doesn &apos;t it follow that Germans lent excessively ? 
If Germany wants the rest of Europe to swallow the bitter pill of fiscal retrenchment , it will eventually have to recognize the implicit quid pro quo . 
It must pledge to boost domestic expenditures , reduce its external surplus , and accept an increase in the ECB &apos;s inflation target . 
The sooner Germany fulfills its side of the bargain , the better it will be for everyone .
