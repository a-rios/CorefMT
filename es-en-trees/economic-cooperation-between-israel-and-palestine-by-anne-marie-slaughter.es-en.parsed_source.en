The Middle East &apos;s Arc of Prosperity 
PRINCETON - As Egypt trembles on the brink of civil war , with alarming levels of violence and hardening divisions on all sides , it is hard to find a truly bright spot anywhere in the Middle East or North Africa . 
Syria &apos;s agony continues unabated ; sectarian attacks in Iraq are becoming more frequent and deadly ; the threads of Lebanon &apos;s fragile peace are fraying ; 
Jordan is awash in refugees ; 
Tunisia faces political crisis ; and Turkey &apos;s star as the embodiment of Islamic democracy has dimmed . 
Yet even with this litany of problems , US Secretary of State John Kerry has decided to focus on Israel and Palestine . 
His justification - &quot; if not now , never &quot; - is almost certainly true . 
In the immortal words of James Carville , Bill Clinton &apos;s campaign manager in 1992 , &quot; It &apos;s the economy , stupid . &quot; 
The dismal failure of Middle Eastern and North African economies to deliver the prosperity that their people desperately want is a constant factor pushing people into the streets . 
It is not the only factor , but rising food prices helped to spread revolutionary fervor from a small group of activists to much of Egypt &apos;s population in 2011 , and again this year in June , when the most frequent grievance against former President Mohamed Morsi concerned not his ideology but his indifference to ordinary Egyptians &quot; needs . 
Against this backdrop , Israel and the Palestinian territories are relatively stable places . 
Israel &apos;s high-quality infrastructure could easily be extended to the West Bank and Gaza if security could be assured , and a young generation of entrepreneurs and technologists has grown up on both sides of the border . 
Forbes magazine reports that &quot; hundreds of Israeli &#91; s &#93; and Palestinians are becoming actual business partners and colleagues in startups that are slowly transforming the Palestinian economy , at least in the West Bank . &quot; 
This is most true in high-tech industries , the sector in which the Middle East lags the most . 
The author of the Forbes article describes a scene in Ramallah that is &quot; indistinguishable from one in Austin or San Francisco , &quot; where &quot; twentysomething Palestinians sip cocktails , their laptops open , their smartphones on . &quot; 
All of this activity is taking place against the odds . 
Alec Ross , a former senior adviser for innovation to former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , argues that the best way to reinvigorate the peace process is to provide 3G Internet connectivity to the West Bank . 
He quotes a young woman in the audience at Palestine Polytechnic University , who said , to loud applause , &quot; We must have a better economy to have better lives , and we must have 3G to have ... a better economy . &quot; 
Without high-speed Internet , foreign investment and indigenous entrepreneurship are almost impossible . 
The human capital for rapid economic growth is there ( roughly 2,000 Palestinians graduate every year with technical skills , yet only 30 % of them find a way to use such skills in a paying job ) , as is the will and the investment capital ; but the necessary infrastructure is lacking . 
A vision of a very different Palestine , and of the Israel beside it , is not hard to find . 
In 2005 , the Rand Corporation , a US research institute , developed the &quot; Arc , &quot; a genuinely inspiring plan to build a transportation corridor that would link Palestine &apos;s principal business and population hubs in the West Bank , then curve across Israel into Gaza , where a long-planned airport and seaport would be built . 
The concept behind this vision is that the size and population density of a future Palestine will be roughly the same as in extended urban regions like the San Francisco Bay area or greater Cairo . 
Thus , the West Bank should be viewed as &quot; an integrated urban region of independent but connected cities . &quot; 
Anyone who spends nine minutes watching the video presentation of the Arc will see that its potential is nothing short of breathtaking . 
While Palestine would gain economically , Israel would gain politically and socially . 
The costs of not reaching a peace settlement may not show up in Israel &apos;s economic statistics or in formal diplomatic interactions . 
Bernard Avishai , a distinguished Israeli professor of business and government who divides his time between Israel and the US , notes that whatever Israel &apos;s young people may think of the Palestinians , they &quot; expect to fly off from Ben-Gurion Airport and land , accepted , in the Western world . &quot; 
Now they know that the stakes are rising . 
So are the opportunities . 
Whereas the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has long been an island of violence and turmoil in a relatively stable ( if oppressed ) region , now the tables are turned . 
An Israel and Palestine that could resolve their differences and live side by side as democracies would become an island of stability and sanity in a sea of political disorder and economic retrenchment . 
Add a free-trade agreement , or even a customs union with Jordan , and you have the makings of a Middle Eastern Benelux ( the grouping of Belgium , the Netherlands , and Luxembourg that formed the economic kernel of what became the original European Community ) . 
A late summer night &apos;s dream ? 
Perhaps . 
And Israelis and Palestinians themselves , with actual or potential civil war on three of their four borders , need no reminders of what could happen if they do not start spreading peace from the inside out .
