Putinism &apos;s Authoritarian Allure 
PARIS - A surprising phenomenon is increasingly apparent in Western Europe : far-right parties are moving away from their traditional anti-communist and anti-Russia ideologies , with many expressing admiration - and even outright support - for Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s regime . 
To be sure , several former and current European political leaders have sought to ally themselves with Putin &apos;s regime . 
Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , for example , joined the board of the Nord Stream gas-pipeline project ( ensuring Germany direct access to Russian supplies via the Baltic Sea ) immediately after leaving office . 
Similarly , The Economist described former Czech President Václav Klaus , a prominent Euro-skeptic , as one of Putin &apos;s &quot; warmest admirers abroad . &quot; 
But opportunism is not ideological affinity . 
By contrast , Germany &apos;s far-right National Democratic Party has demonstrated nostalgia for East German virtues , calling the defunct German Democratic Republic &quot; a better Germany &quot; than the Federal Republic . 
In 2011 , the NPD officially merged with another far-right party , the German People &apos;s Union , which has long been linked to Russia &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party ( LDPR ) and its founder and leader , the ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky . 
While Zhirinovsky has long been a prominent member of Putin &apos;s opposition , he has displayed similarly authoritarian tendencies , for example , by promising to establish a police state if elected President . 
And his communist links are clear . 
Not only was the LDPR &apos;s establishment a joint project of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the KGB , but Zhirinovsky has also advocated returning to Germany the eastern territories - including much of Poland and the Baltic region - that it lost in World War II . In France , the extreme right &apos;s shifting allegiances are even more pronounced , exemplified in its budding friendship with the new Russia . 
In a 2011 interview , Marine Le Pen , leader of the National Front , conveyed her admiration for Putin , before announcing that , if she were elected President in 2012 , France would leave NATO and seek a trilateral alliance with Germany and Russia . 
Moreover , Marion Maréchal-Le Pen , Le Pen &apos;s niece and one of the party &apos;s two MPs , is a prominent member of the National Front-sponsored France-Europe-Russia group , which advocates a &quot; multipolar &quot; - or , more accurately , a less American - world . 
Last December , Maréchal-Le Pen allegedly visited Aleksey Pushkov , chairman of the Duma &apos;s international affairs committee and a reputed Putinist hardliner . 
Given Putinism &apos;s uncertain ideological roots , this turn toward Russia might seem puzzling . 
After all , Putinism is characterized less by what it endorses than by what it opposes - the West and Western-style democracy , liberalism , communism , and individualism . In fact , Western Europe &apos;s extreme-right parties &quot; attraction to Putin &apos;s negative agenda can be understood in relation to another authoritarian anti-ideology : Benito Mussolini &apos;s fascism . 
According to Mussolini &apos;s 1932 essay La dottrina del fascismo ( The Doctrine of Fascism ) , written with the philosopher Giovanni Gentile , fascism opposes democracy , socialism , liberalism , and individualism ( in addition to Bolshevism , parliamentarianism , Freemasonry , pacifism , and egalitarianism ) . 
But , while Putinism and Italian Fascism share the rare characteristic of rejecting both communist and democratic ideologies , there is an important distinction in their approach to the latter . 
While Mussolini formally declared fascism to be anti-democratic , Putin does not openly reject democracy , or explicitly advocate a one-party state . 
Rather , he claims to have established a &quot; managed &quot; or &quot; sovereign &quot; democracy - a system that prevents the alternation of power , thereby establishing a one-party state as a matter of fact , if not of principle . 
In this sense , Putinism can serve as a model for extreme-right parties , which , in post-World War II Europe , cannot openly advocate an authoritarian regime or a one-party system . 
Indeed , Putinism is demonstrating how to manipulate the rules of parliamentary democracy - by which all of Europe &apos;s political parties have been forced to play since WWII &apos;s end - to serve authoritarian objectives . 
Putin &apos;s public image as a strong and virile adventurer , captured in photos depicting him fishing and hunting shirtless , reinforces his appeal as a powerful , charismatic leader . 
( Similarly , Mussolini was filmed bare-chested , harvesting corn . ) 
And a clear parallel exists between Putin &apos;s close relationship with the conservative , ultra-nationalist Russian Orthodox Church and the National Front &apos;s connection to integrist Catholic circles . 
Furthermore , Western Europe &apos;s extreme right can learn from Putin &apos;s management of his youth organization , Nashi . 
Unlike the Soviet Union &apos;s Komsomol , which had all but ceased to serve as an ideological tool for the Communist Party by the time the USSR collapsed , Nashi has been accused of harassing diplomats and the regime &apos;s opponents - suggesting a closer resemblance to the Hitler Youth or even Mussolini &apos;s Blackshirts . 
Indeed , while Nashi seems more like a collection of roguish hooligans , its members do receive paramilitary training to complement their ultra-nationalist ideological indoctrination . 
Putinism presents a clever and effective model of a right-wing authoritarian regime that can function within modern Europe &apos;s sociopolitical constraints - one that Western Europe &apos;s extreme right seems keen to emulate . 
Let us hope that these forces do not make common cause with Europe &apos;s more unscrupulous mainstream political leaders .
