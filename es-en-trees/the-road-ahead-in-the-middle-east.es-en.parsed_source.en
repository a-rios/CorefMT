The Road Ahead in the Middle East 
During these hard times for Israeli-Palestinian relations , it is vital that positive steps be taken and international goodwill be mobilized . 
For a significant number of both Palestinians and Israelis , the use of force has come to represent the only conceivable option . 
Palestinian society can feel very little hope in the immediate term , so what else is there to lose ? 
Yet it seems just as clear that the pursuit of extreme measures by any party will surely lead to wider and worse clashes . 
Rather than resign ourselves to more years of hate and misery , it is urgent that the foundations for future peace be rebuilt before all civilized structures are swept away . 
The priority in everyone &apos;s minds is the present conflict ; but until human well being becomes a universal priority , conflicts will continue to dominate interpersonal and international relations . 
Those who wish to contribute to reducing tensions should identify and promote starting points for peace-builders to find common ground . 
Political and media support ought to focus on programs that work on the ground , as reported by humanitarian and non-governmental agencies , and not on particular religious agendas . 
Priority should go to cooperative projects - enhancing cooperation between different faiths , between different schools within the same faith , and between religious and secular groups . 
Islam as a religion of peace and human betterment is betrayed by anyone who commits atrocities in its name . 
It is a broad and inclusive religion whose adherents across the world presently suffer from their lack of a unified voice . 
For example , issuing fatwas , or religious edicts , is legitimately undertaken by those whose high standing is acknowledged by the whole Ummah , or Muslim community . 
We need trustworthy and reputable bodies for issuing globally significant fatwa , with the authority to represent Muslim communities worldwide ; such bodies could be based in Mecca and Najaf , representing Sunni and Shi &apos;a centers of religious thought . 
Such a step would bring to non-Muslims some of the sharpest thinking in the Islamic world , and would contribute a missing voice to debates about global values . 
Globalization and Islam are not incompatible , so long as Islam is recognized as a tradition that has much to contribute to world civilization , not treated as a menace to be neutralized . 
The goal today must be to modernize each tradition , while remaining faithful to its roots . 
A total collapse of religious norms would truly be destabilizing . 
If it is to succeed in making the world a better place , globalization can not be predicated upon market forces alone , but needs to reinforce the stability and integration of diverse societies . 
In the Middle East , clear ethical leadership is needed . 
But such leadership cannot achieve results in a vacuum . 
Global standards of behavior can only be implemented effectively if they are upheld by all . 
If a supposedly universal policy is seen to be applied inconsistently in order to further one nation &apos;s or culture &apos;s interests , that policy will lose credibility and be rejected as representing a double standard . 
It is the responsibility of rulers and opinion leaders to insist that universal rights are implemented universally - that all , without exception , are subject to the rule of law . 
Only when we achieve a culture of compliance with humanitarian norms will we be able to establish the framework for securing a vibrant civil society , negotiation instead of conflict , and continuing human welfare . 
The developed world has an obligation to live up to the standards of the Declaration of Human Rights and other documents describing universal norms . 
One of the most important expressions of goodwill is the gift of humanitarian aid . 
At this time , when military conflict risks worsening in different corners of the world , western agencies in particular can support the people of a troubled area . 
Yet humanitarian aid must not become just another foreign policy tool . 
If aid is thought by the people receiving it to be manipulated for political gain , it will reduce the possibility for international relations based on any kind of trust . 
There should be a re-evaluation of the place of altruism and compliance with universal humanitarian norms . 
The international community can offer stability and improvements in living conditions for both Israelis and Palestinians by intervening now with a peacekeeping and humanitarian presence , endorsed by the United Nations and with the support of the United States . 
Outside intervention may be necessary , including international commitment to specific objectives - not just to a process intended to reach those objectives - before it becomes possible to visualize a viable future in which both parties can flourish alongside each other .
