Overcoming Europe &apos;s Twin Growth Challenges 
MUNICH - As economic recovery finally begins to take hold in Europe , the imperative for policymakers is to ensure that growth can be sustained far into the future . 
Fiscal and monetary stimulus may have been appropriate at the peak of the crisis , but they will do little to address the biggest threat to the continent &apos;s long-term prospects : a toxic twosome of weak demographics and low investment . 
Even assuming a steady inflow of immigrants , the combined workforces of the 28 European Union countries are projected to shrink by 12-16 million people over the next 15 years , according to the OECD and the European Commission . 
A sharper rise in the number of newcomers could help ameliorate the situation ; but higher immigration is not , on its own , an adequate solution to the EU economy &apos;s long-term problems . 
Europe &apos;s only hope for sustained growth is to boost productivity , so that it can derive more value from its shrinking workforce . 
The trouble is that it has been many years since the continent last saw significant productivity gains . 
In Western Europe , growth in labor productivity ( output per hour worked ) has been decelerating for decades . 
In the 1960s , labor productivity grew at a robust 4 % annual rate , before slowing to 2 % in the 1980s and dropping below 1 % around the turn of the century . 
Today it crawls forward at about 0.5 % a year . 
Meanwhile , total factor productivity , which takes into account technological innovation , has been stagnant . 
The EU desperately needs economic growth to enable its member states to sustain their social security and welfare systems as their societies get older - a challenge that other regions and countries are facing as well . 
China , for example , is facing a similar demographic challenge , as its labor force shrinks and the number of retirees rises rapidly . 
The decline in productivity growth in the EU is surprising , given the rapid onset of digitalization - often described as the industrial revolution of the twenty-first century . 
In fact , part of the perceived slowdown can be attributed to measurement issues : In Europe , as well as the United States , the technological changes being wrought by smartphones and the Internet simply are not showing up in the productivity data . 
Statisticians struggle , for example , to account for how consumers are benefiting from the increased quality and speed of delivery that often results from digitalization . 
Furthermore , in the digital age , many services are being provided free of charge , which means they are not being counted as consumption at all . 
Another factor that may be contributing to flat productivity is that many corporations run traditional physical business models parallel to new digital ones . 
Adding high-tech systems to traditional processes can temporarily increase costs and thus depress productivity , especially if the new and old businesses are not well connected . 
These issues should diminish with time ; as that happens , part of the productivity lull should disappear . 
But not all of the slowdown in productivity growth can be attributed to the cumbersome transition to a new technological era . 
Even as the economy has started to recover , investment in Europe remains well below its level in 2008 . 
Long-term economic health will depend , in large part , on whether investment recovers and by how much . 
And there are reasons for pessimism . 
Weak investment activity partly reflects a gloomy view of the European market . 
If workforces are stagnating or shrinking and growth is subdued , why spend on boosting output ? 
Simply put , Europe &apos;s problems have become intertwined . 
The continent needs productivity-enhancing investment in order to compensate for its shrinking workforce ; but its demographic weakness is causing companies to hold back . 
Fortunately , there is much that can be done . 
A renewed push to integrate European markets for services , digital goods , capital markets , and energy would remove barriers to business and bring new incentives to invest . 
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that the EU is currently negotiating with the US would also create a larger market , with less burdensome regulation and more competition . 
On a national level , reform drives like those carried out in Ireland , Portugal , and Spain could improve business conditions and competitiveness across the continent . 
Finally , all European countries could redouble their efforts to educate and train their residents for the digital era . 
Policymakers must not rest on the optimistic assumption that Europe &apos;s economy will recover on its own . 
As workers and companies struggle to compete in a rapidly changing - and increasingly winner-take-all - global economy , the need for policies that will ensure long-term growth could not be more urgent .
