Is Syria the Next Domino ? 
LONDON - With the Tunisian and Egyptian regimes gone and street protests roiling cities from Algiers to Tehran , many people are now wondering which domino might fall next . 
Syria , whose secular , militarized dictatorship most closely resembles the fallen regimes of Tunisia and Egypt , may not be next in line , but appears nonetheless to be approaching a tipping point . 
Of course , the old &quot; domino theory &quot; in international relations was only a crude way of emphasizing that different parts of any region are linked to each other . 
For today &apos;s Arab world , a better metaphor might be a chessboard , from which the removal of even a pawn inevitably alters the relationships among all the other pieces . 
Today , as protests mount and multiply , the government of every Arab state in the Middle East and North Africa probably believes that , if left to its own devices , it can contain internal dissent . 
In Syria , it seems inevitable that protest may soon crack the regime &apos;s brittle political immobility . 
Most ordinary Syrians face extremely difficult economic and social conditions , including high unemployment , rising food prices , constraints on personal freedom , and endemic corruption . 
These factors are no different from those that brought people on to the streets in North Africa and the Middle East . 
What began as protests over living conditions became full-scale demands for freedom and democracy . 
The regime in Damascus is fearful of similar unrest , as it should be . 
The best way to avoid a confrontation between the people and the security forces is a process of genuine reform leading to elections and a government of national unity . 
The ingrained inertia of the current regime , however , seems to preclude any early move toward that . 
Instead , Syria &apos;s rulers are offering inducements to ensure that key constituencies remain in line - laptops for teachers , subsidies for public-sector workers , and empty reformist rhetoric . 
But the current situation calls for far more serious measures . 
Lifting the state of emergency that has been in force since 1963 - giving sweeping powers to the regime and its security services - would be both a symbolic and tangible step in the right direction . 
Unless Syria &apos;s rulers , like other leaders in the Arab world , begin to appreciate that freedom is a fundamental human right , even the most quiescent people &apos;s patience may wear dangerously thin . 
High food prices may have served as a trigger in North Africa , but the speed with which the protesters turned their attention to political reform caught everyone off guard . 
Putting this genie back in its bottle would be virtually impossible without bloodshed of the type we are now witnessing in some parts of the Arab world . 
So the Syrian leadership knows that it must respond - hence the half-hearted reform agenda that it recently outlined . 
But trying to address deep-rooted popular grievances with flowery language and a bouquet of subsidies is like trying to extinguish a forest fire with a water pistol . 
The solutions to Syria &apos;s problems must be as substantive as the problems are serious . 
Until now , Syria &apos;s rulers have relied on their anti-Israel , anti-Western rhetoric to protect themselves . 
But cries about the Israel-Palestine conflict were rarely heard in the protests in Tunis and Cairo . 
Furthermore , in the last few years , when Israeli planes struck targets in Syria , there was no answer from the regime -amp # 160 ; and still none when Israeli planes flew over the presidential palace . 
The regime claims that it is part of the &apos; resistance &apos; with its senior partner Iran . 
However the WikiLeaks cables show that the Syrian leadership told the Iranian regime not to count on it in any war with Israel because it is too weak . 
So the regime is making a fatal error if it thinks that its old diversionary tactics will continue to provide it with immunity . 
On the contrary , with a young , well-educated population unable to find suitable work , the regime has created its own cadre of potential protestors , who are aware that it is using empty slogans to keep the state of emergency and stay in power . 
The Syrian people are strong , patient , resilient , and resourceful . 
Family and social bonds remain potent in the face of adversity . 
When food is scarce , people share . 
When the regime cracks down on the Internet , people use proxy servers . 
But they should not have to make do . 
They should not have to risk their safety when they seek to engage with the world online . 
No one wants to see the streets of Damascus consumed in protest , or a violent confrontation erupt between protesters and security forces . 
What the Syrian people want is a meaningful dialogue with the regime . 
The regime must appreciate that , despite its best efforts , Syrians have been watching events in the region with as much interest as the rest of the world . 
Syria &apos;s people may have no predilection for violence , but the birth of freedom , once witnessed , is not easily forgotten - or trumped by state handouts and vacuous statements by a distant , self-isolated leadership . 
People said the Berlin Wall would not fall . 
They said that Mubarak would not stand down . 
And still some say that Syria cannot change . 
But Syria will change , and I , like my compatriots , pray that when change comes , it is peaceful and harmonious .
