Hillary in Asia , Round Two 
SINGAPORE - US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is scheduled to travel to Asia again in July to meet foreign ministers at the ASEAN Regional Forum , and to visit India . 
On her first Asian trip in February , she provided a welcome contrast to the past with her openness to others &quot; views , her willingness to cooperate , and her star power . 
She made Asians look at America anew . 
But this trip will be trickier . 
One challenge is that part of the plot for the US and Clinton is being written by others . 
North Korea will be on the agenda after its missile tests , as will Myanmar , since its generals persist in prosecuting Aung San Suu Kyi , the world &apos;s most famous political detainee , on trivial charges . 
Nothing positive will come from the US condemning these two difficult regimes unilaterally . 
So a key goal of Clinton &apos;s visit must be to pull together with the Asian leaders present at the ASEAN Regional Forum . 
As for Myanmar , its neighbors and fellow ASEAN members - Indonesia , Singapore , Malaysia , and Thailand - are also concerned about Suu Kyi &apos;s continued prosecution . 
The US should begin to work with these countries not only on this matter , but also on the elections that Myanmar military junta has promised for 2010 . 
Together , they should press for assurances of a free and fair process , with the aim of avoiding the kind of mess that followed the Iranian elections . 
Indonesia can be one ally . 
After decades of autocracy , this vast archipelago of a country just concluded a presidential election that has solidified its transition to democracy . 
India , proud of its long-standing democracy and fresh from its own elections , shares a border with Myanmar and can also assist efforts there . 
The approach to North Korea is similar . 
Kim Jong-il is a naughty boy who wants attention and incentives to behave decently . 
Rather than debate with her counterparts , Clinton needs to ensure that other countries in the six-party framework , especially China and South Korea , are on the same page as the US . 
On both issues , there is little capacity to exert force or sufficient pressure for solutions any time soon . 
So diplomatic efforts must instead aim to join Americans and like-minded Asians in common cause , to push for steps forward in the medium to longer term . 
Others must be brought on board , especially the Regional Forum hosts , ASEAN and Thailand . 
A moral community should form in Asia , one that displaces its leaders &quot; usual cynical calculations of power in order to jump on the right bandwagon . 
In all this , China is the 800-pound dragon in the room . 
China is already closer to ASEAN and a key player with respect to Myanmar , North Korea , and other sticky issues . 
A &quot; bamboo &quot; economic zone appears to be emerging , perhaps to replace today &apos;s weakening US-centric trans-Pacific ties . 
This is the context for Clinton &apos;s visit to India , as well . 
George W. Bush &apos;s administration should be credited for giving overdue recognition to India , but this was done primarily on a bilateral basis . 
The US should now leverage that relationship to work on regional and even global issues . 
Besides her own work , Clinton is likely to also be inundated during this visit with requests concerning President Barack Obama . 
There is still no confirmation concerning when Obama will visit Asia , though many expect that he will attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit , to be held in Singapore in November . 
China , Japan , and Indonesia must be among Obama &apos;s priorities , but many others will clamor for him to visit their capitals . 
Clinton and the US administration would do well to decide which requests are merely photo ops and confine these to meetings at the sidelines of APEC . 
The US should insist on a substantive agenda as a precondition for any Obama visit . 
In China , for example , Clinton successfully established an agenda for the two countries to work together on climate change . 
Plans and resources now must be prepared . 
Clinton has reopened the doors for Obama in Asia with charm and confidence . 
Obama will eventually come to Asia with many high expectations and star billing . 
While his charisma and openness to dialog will be sought after , substance will also be measured and much needed . 
By November , after all , it will be more than a year since the global crisis began in the US , and Obama and his team must show tangible prospects for recovery . 
American leadership - globally and in Asia - can no longer be presumed .
