Making Human Rights Treaties Work 
As the United States prepares to take the war on terrorism to Saddam Hussein &apos;s doorstep , the Bush administration has repeatedly called attention to human rights violations in Iraq . 
The Iraqi regime , President Bush tells us , has engaged in torture and extra-judicial killing and keeps the Iraqi people from enjoying basic civic and political freedoms . 
Not once , however , has the President suggested that these problems might be addressed through the UN human rights treaty system - a system through which Iraq has committed to abide by the very principles it is accused of violating . 
Perhaps this is because the Bush administration , which has just opted out of the treaty creating the International Criminal Court and is busy trying to minimize the effects of the treaty on the US , would rather not focus attention on UN treaties just now . 
Or perhaps it is because Iraq is far from alone in its disregard of its human rights treaty commitments . 
Whatever the reason , the apparent irrelevance of the human rights treaty system in current debates is a worrisome sign . 
In the half century since the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the world community has created nearly 100 universal and regional human rights agreements governing issues as diverse as discrimination against women , state-sponsored torture , and the right of collective bargaining . 
Although these developments provide clear symbols of the world &apos;s ongoing commitment to protecting human rights , strikingly little is known about the true effectiveness of such treaties in achieving their goals . 
My own recent research suggests that although countries that ratify treaties usually have better human rights records than countries that do not , countries with the worst human rights records actually ratify many treaties as often as nations with the best practices . 
Indeed , half of the countries responsible for the most recent widespread cases of genocide , including Rwanda in 1994 and Yugoslavia in the early 1990s , had ratified the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide . 
This was essentially the same rate of ratification found among countries that had committed no genocide . 
Moreover , violations of human rights treaties abound . 
Iraq , which just held an election in which Saddam Hussein was re-elected in an uncontested election with 100 % of the vote , long ago ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 
And Afghanistan , which under the Taliban prohibited women &apos;s participation in political or civic life , was and is a member of the Convention on the Political Rights of Women . 
Of course , that some rogue states ratify human rights treaties should not call the treaty system as a whole into doubt . 
Human rights treaties serve to foster gradual improvements in human rights practices in both non-ratifying and ratifying countries through changes in shared understandings of what behavior is acceptable . 
Torture was once considered acceptable state practice . 
That it is no longer is partly due to the creation of several treaties that prohibit its use . 
Human rights treaties may also have positive effects on ratifying countries over the long term , creating public commitments to which human rights activists can point as they push nations to make gradual , if grudging , improvements down the road . 
Nonetheless , there is as of yet no clear evidence that the UN &apos;s human rights treaties have a direct measurable positive impact on the human rights practices of individual countries that ratify them , all else being equal . 
Perhaps this should not be so surprising . 
For the most part , human rights treaties are poorly monitored and enforced , and those countries that join face little or no penalty for failing to match their rhetoric with action . 
In this context , it is perhaps to be expected that some countries might be tempted to use ratification to try to placate those pressing for improvements in human rights , thereby turning ratification into a substitute for , rather than a spur to , real improvements in human rights . 
What , then , should be done to make the human rights treaty system more effective and more relevant ? 
A first step would be to augment today &apos;s reliance on self-policing with a stronger system of independent expert monitoring . 
The more information we have about countries &apos; human rights practices , the harder it will be for them to get away with abuses . 
Above all , guardians of human rights must remain vigilant , viewing ratification of treaties not as the end of the struggle for human dignity , but as the beginning in an evolving campaign .
