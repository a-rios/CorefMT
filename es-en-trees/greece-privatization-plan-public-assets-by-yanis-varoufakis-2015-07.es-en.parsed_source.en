Europe &apos;s Vindictive Privatization Plan for Greece 
ATHENS - On July 12 , the summit of eurozone leaders dictated its terms of surrender to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras , who , terrified by the alternatives , accepted all of them . 
One of those terms concerned the disposition of Greece &apos;s remaining public assets . 
Eurozone leaders demanded that Greek public assets be transferred to a Treuhand-like fund - a fire-sale vehicle similar to the one used after the fall of the Berlin Wall to privatize quickly , at great financial loss , and with devastating effects on employment all of the vanishing East German state &apos;s public property . 
This Greek Treuhand would be based in - wait for it - Luxembourg , and would be run by an outfit overseen by Germany &apos;s finance minister , Wolfgang Schäuble , the author of the scheme . 
It would complete the fire sales within three years . 
Euclid Tsakalotos , who succeeded me as Greece &apos;s finance minister two weeks ago , did his best to ameliorate the worst aspects of the Greek Treuhand plan . 
He managed to have the fund domiciled in Athens , and he extracted from Greece &apos;s creditors ( the so-called troika of the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund ) the important concession that the sales could extend to 30 years , rather than a mere three . 
Alas , the Greek Treuhand remains an abomination , and it should be a stigma on Europe &apos;s conscience . 
Worse , it is a wasted opportunity . 
The plan is politically toxic , because the fund , though domiciled in Greece , will effectively be managed by the troika . 
It is also financially noxious , because the proceeds will go toward servicing what even the IMF now admits is an unpayable debt . 
It did not have to be this way . 
On June 19 , I communicated to the German government and to the troika an alternative proposal , as part of a document entitled &quot; Ending the Greek Crisis &quot; : 
&quot; The Greek government proposes to bundle public assets ( excluding those pertinent to the country &apos;s security , public amenities , and cultural heritage ) into a central holding company to be separated from the government administration and to be managed as a private entity , under the aegis of the Greek Parliament , with the goal of maximizing the value of its underlying assets and creating a homegrown investment stream . 
The Greek state will be the sole shareholder , but will not guarantee its liabilities or debt . &quot; 
The holding company would play an active role readying the assets for sale . 
It would &quot; issue a fully collateralized bond on the international capital markets &quot; to raise € 30-40 billion ( $ 32-43 billion ) , which , &quot; taking into account the present value of assets , &quot; would &quot; be invested in modernizing and restructuring the assets under its management . &quot; 
The plan envisaged an investment program of 3-4 years , resulting in &quot; additional spending of 5 % of GDP per annum , &quot; with current macroeconomic conditions implying &quot; a positive growth multiplier above 1.5 , &quot; which &quot; should boost nominal GDP growth to a level above 5 % for several years . &quot; 
This , in turn , would induce &quot; proportional increases in tax revenues , &quot; thereby &quot; contributing to fiscal sustainability , while enabling the Greek government to exercise spending discipline without further shrinking the social economy . &quot; 
In this scenario , the primary surplus ( which excludes interest payments ) would &quot; achieve &quot; escape velocity &quot; magnitudes in absolute as well as percentage terms over time . &quot; 
As a result , the holding company would &quot; be granted a banking license &quot; within a year or two , &quot; thus turning itself into a full-fledged Development Bank capable of crowding in private investment to Greece and of entering into collaborative projects with the European Investment Bank . &quot; 
The Development Bank that we proposed would &quot; allow the government to choose which assets are to be privatized and which not , while guaranteeing a greater impact on debt reduction from the selected privatizations . &quot; 
After all , &quot; asset values should increase by more than the actual amount spent on modernization and restructuring , aided by a program of public-private partnerships whose value is boosted according to the probability of future privatization . &quot; 
Our proposal was greeted with deafening silence . 
More precisely , the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers and the troika continued to leak to the global media that the Greek authorities had no credible , innovative proposals on offer - their standard refrain . 
A few days later , once the powers-that-be realized that the Greek government was about to capitulate fully to the troika &apos;s demands , they saw fit to impose upon Greece their demeaning , unimaginative , and pernicious Treuhand model . 
At a turning point in European history , our innovative alternative was thrown into the dustbin . 
It remains there for others to retrieve .
