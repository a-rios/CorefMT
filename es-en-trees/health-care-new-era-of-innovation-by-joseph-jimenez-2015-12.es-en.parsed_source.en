A New Era of Health-Care Innovation 
ZURICH - We are experiencing a new wave of innovation in health care - one that promises to create the smartest , most connected , and most efficient health systems the world has ever seen . 
Game-changing new technologies and treatments are transforming the practice of medicine , dramatically altering the patient experience , and creating conditions for even more breakthroughs . 
The proof is in the data . 
Last year , a record 61 drugs were introduced worldwide , compared with an annual average of 34 in the previous decade . 
More than 40 % of these treatments were for rare or difficult-to-treat conditions , including hepatitis C , meningococcal B , and metastatic melanoma . 
And more new breakthroughs are on the horizon . 
It is estimated that about 70 % of the drugs currently in development across the industry are potential &quot; first in class &quot; treatments , meaning that they use a completely new mechanism of action against disease . 
The new wave of innovation is attributable to three key factors : the ability to personalize therapy , the capacity to get treatments to market faster , and improved engagement with patients . 
First , major advances in our knowledge of genomics - specifically , the way diseases manifest and develop in the body at the genetic level - are improving our ability to target illness at each stage and improve the patient experience . 
Genetic markers , for example , can indicate which patients are likely to benefit from a drug , thereby improving outcomes while allowing patients to avoid potentially painful side effects of treatments that are unlikely to work . 
For early-stage breast cancer patients , genetic markers show whether chemotherapy is likely to have an impact , or if hormone therapy alone is the better option . 
A new lung cancer drug developed by my company , Novartis , is effective only in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who have a particular genetic mutation . 
The use of genomic expertise to improve health care is just beginning . 
One promising area of investigation is CRISPR - a cutting-edge tool that could allow us to delete , repair , or replace the genes that cause disease . 
As our understanding of the characteristics of a particular patient &apos;s illness becomes increasingly precise , treatment will become increasingly effective and will reduce the risk of side effects . 
Moreover , advances in our understanding of disease are boosting the efficiency of the drug development process , making it possible to bring new innovations to market faster . 
For example , genetic testing is being used to pre-select participants for clinical trials , cutting recruitment times . 
With this approach , research can begin in as little as three weeks , compared to the 34 weeks , on average , for a standard trial . 
Add to that our ability to analyze data more quickly , and to make more precise decisions about dosing , and the clinical trial timeframe shrinks considerably . 
Finally , real-time data and emerging technology tools have the potential to improve patient engagement and adherence , especially among those with chronic conditions caused by non-communicable diseases ( NCDs ) . 
As the world &apos;s population ages , the incidence of NCDs is expected to rise , accounting for 52 million deaths annually by 2030 . 
More than 80 % of NCD deaths are the result of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases , cancer , and diabetes . 
As it stands , noncompliance with medication regimes is a major problem in treating NCDs . 
For example , diabetes patients in the United States with the lowest level of compliance have a 30 % yearly risk of hospitalization , compared to a 13 % risk for patients with a high level of adherence . 
That implies large costs for health-care systems - about $ 200 billion in the US and â‚¬ 125 billion ( $ 133 billion ) in the European Union each year . 
Technologies that engage patients in their own health care and enable more seamless adherence to medication regimes have the potential to improve disease management , reduce hospitalization , and lower costs . 
Today &apos;s transformational advances in health care owe much to new genomics information , to the availability of big data to influence decisions in real time , to more targeted and individualized therapies , and to smarter , more connected delivery systems . 
But they are just the beginning . 
Further breakthroughs , enabled by the convergence of science and technology , can be expected , especially as unconventional players enter the health-care sector . 
In this process , partnerships between health-care and technology companies will become increasingly important . 
It is an exciting time for health care , with many disruptive innovations on the horizon . 
For patients and providers alike , this is very good news .
