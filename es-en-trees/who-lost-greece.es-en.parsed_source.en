Who Lost Greece ? 
BRUSSELS - The blame game in Europe has not yet begun . 
An agreement between Greece and its private creditors and public lenders will enable it to meet its next debt repayment deadline of March 20 . 
The Europeans should be commended for a significant step in the direction of realism . 
Private creditors have accepted a haircut of more than 50 % on their claims and a lowering of interest rates , bringing the total debt relief to more than two-thirds . 
But , while a solution was found in extremis , many people believe that it will merely postpone the day of reckoning , as Greece will not implement the promised austerity , and will end up either deciding to exit the eurozone or being pushed out following an eventual default . 
Even before the latest deal , political leaders in the Netherlands and Finland , and some in Germany , were wondering aloud why Greece should remain in the euro . 
In Athens , exasperation has reached new heights , and the bitterness of the disputes has started to echo dangerously the rabid disputes over German reparations of the 1920 &quot; s . 
&quot; Who lost China ? &quot; 
Europeans may well soon start asking themselves the same question about Greece . 
The main culprit , of course , is the Greeks themselves . 
The fecklessness of their politicians has plumbed new depths , patronage has poisoned their government , Transparency International &apos;s corruption index ranks their country 80th in the world , and , in September 2011 , the Greek treasury had carried out only 31 of the 75 tax audits of high-income individuals promised for the year as a whole . 
But it would be too easy to leave it at that and absolve the rest of Europe of responsibility . 
European officials &quot; first error was to procrastinate for months , only to produce an unrealistic assistance program that foresaw Greece &apos;s return to the capital markets by 2013 . 
It is now clear that it will take years , perhaps a decade , to reform the economy and correct its imbalances . 
Europe &apos;s second error was its incoherent response to the solvency crisis . 
Two strategies were possible : either an early reduction of Greece &apos;s sovereign debt , thereby restoring solvency rapidly , or mutualization of Greek debt in the name of preserving the collective reputation of all eurozone sovereigns . 
Either strategy would have been coherent , but Germany and France agreed on a cocktail of both , which was not . 
The Germans and French pretended that Greece was solvent and lent to it at punitive interest rates , which made the situation worse . 
It took 18 months to abandon this policy . 
The third error was getting priorities wrong . 
From the outset of the crisis , the International Monetary Fund diagnosed a twin problem : weak public finances and a severe loss of competitiveness . 
Unfortunately , policymakers focused on the former , and blithely hoped that structural reforms would resolve the latter . 
The Greek authorities invested most of their meager political capital in budgetary adjustment rather than in building a competitive economy . 
The program now being finalized reverses the order of priorities , putting competitiveness and growth ahead of completion of budgetary consolidation . 
Still , the question remains why this decision had to wait almost two years . 
Fourth , nothing substantive has been done about growth . 
Greece could in principle have counted on a large amount of regional development aid from the European Union budget , which was underutilized owing to a lack of local co-financing . 
It took until last summer to recognize - and even then only to a modest degree - that this aid could be used to support economic recovery . 
Europe &apos;s final error was a certain level of indifference to fair burden-sharing . 
It is understandable that the IMF , a technocratic institution , does not venture beyond macroeconomics . 
But the EU is a political entity that has made social justice one of its fundamental goals . 
Contrary to much facile criticism , Europe cannot be reproached for imposing austerity on the Greeks . 
This is the necessary counterpart of a major effort at financial support , and a country with such huge imbalances must inevitably be subject to extreme rigor . 
But Europe can be reproached for an initially late , badly designed , unbalanced , and inequitable program . 
If the question as to who lost Greece arises one day , there will be enough blame to go around .
