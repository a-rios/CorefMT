The Death of Death 
Once again killing on a great scale has been taking place , this time in a land in which Paradise is said to have once lay - the valley between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers . 
Today &apos;s killing is no worse than history &apos;s countless massacres , perhaps even more restrained . 
Some suggest that it was necessary to forestall future killings . 
In any case , it is the sad , solitary privilege of human beings to kill our own consciously , as well as to commit suicide . 
This is so , we can rightfully assume , because human beings are the only beings that comprehend death - that of others as well as our own . 
We all know that we will die one day . 
&quot; You are one being among many / Only you hang on to Beauty / And know : you must part , &quot; wrote the poet Reiner Kunze . 
This knowledge penetrates every moment of our lives . 
Media in vita in morte sumus - in the midst of life , we are surrounded by death - went a medieval song . 
Heidegger made the knowledge of death key to the understanding of what it means to live . 
Death isolates every individual , because there is no such thing as collective dying . 
Everyone dies alone . 
Those who realize this are thus tempted to deny any meaning to human conduct ; everything , it seems , is futile in the end , because in dying we leave society and society leaves us . 
On the other hand , only the knowledge of our mortality provides our existence with its preciousness . 
If we did not die , everything would lose meaning . 
Everything we do today , we could do tomorrow . 
At a golden wedding anniversary one may wish that , now , everything should really start in earnest . 
But endlessly ? 
That would immediately ruin everything . 
Knowledge of the end opens up dimension of meaning , which also makes it possible for some things to be meaningless . 
&quot; You hang on to beauty ... &quot; - this is the other characteristic that Kunze &apos;s poem ascribes to humanity . 
The experience of beauty is closely related to knowledge of death . 
Beauty does not derive its meaning from its value for our biological survival or its use for other people , who must also die . 
What we call beautiful has meaning in itself . 
It can be human gestures and actions , even when they are futile or squandered on the wrong people . 
Beauty is resistant to the hubbub of the absurd . 
For religious believers , as earlier with Plato , beauty is a foretaste of what survives death . 
How does society deal with dying and death ? 
With death one ceases to be a member of society . 
A state can threaten death , but , as many totalitarian regimes have learned , no one is stronger - and possibly more dangerous - than those who have overcome the fear of death . 
The threat of death is a powerful weapon . 
To have to deliver on that threat is always a defeat . 
The ritualized culture of death and funerals in the old European tradition was an experience in which society was aware of its limits . 
By embedding death in rituals , society made its self-questioning into a part of itself . 
This attitude has a necessary religious dimension - and one that legitimized society . 
By acknowledging itself as finite and limited , society could think of itself as also sanctioned by God . 
Belief in immortality made the opposition between life and death relative . 
Mortals see death as the gateway to true life , much as a caterpillar might look at a butterfly . 
As the words inscribed on an execution sword in Munster put it : &quot; When I raise this sword , I wish the poor sinner eternal life . &quot; 
Our atheist modern age understands the contrast between life and death as absolute . 
We search for some palliatives , but they are ineffective . 
&quot; My life continues in the lives of my children , &quot; we say , but for an individual this is an empty phrase . 
We doggedly fight to prolong life , only to find that we cannot win this battle - and are left unable to produce authentic rituals to accompany the end of our existence . 
Because our societies have no sense of limits , they strive to eliminate death from our consciousness . 
More and more often , death takes place in a hidden hospital room . 
Death is suppressed socially , but the effect is that individuals &apos; fear of death grows ever greater . 
Most people nowadays face death never having witnessed the death of someone else ! 
Next comes a desire to eliminate quietly those who can no longer be seen as members of the social world . 
Holland , with its euthanasia law , is not internationally condemned ; indeed , its killer-doctors see themselves as an avant-garde . 
Suddenly , such killings can &apos;t go fast enough . 
Definition of death as &quot; brain death &quot; allows one to declare breathing beings dead and to eliminate the process of dying , in order to exploit the dying as warehouses of spare parts for the living . 
Death no longer comes at the end of the process of dying , but - by decree of a Harvard commission - at the beginning . 
The Judeo-Christian custom of burial is rapidly being replaced - not by the ritual of an Indian pyre , but by a crematorium , i.e. , the destruction of a corpse by means of high-temperature machines , a procedure from which the public is excluded . 
More and more people believe that they are doing their children a favor by letting themselves be buried anonymously &quot; under the green grass &quot; to spare them the costs of the funeral and the upkeep of the grave . 
The oldest distinction of homo sapiens - ritual burial of the dead - is disappearing .
