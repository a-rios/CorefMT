India &apos;s Growth Crossroads 
MANILA - As the slowdown in the world &apos;s major industrial economies drags on , growth in developing Asia is being affected . 
A serious burden will likely be placed on the region &apos;s major economies , particularly its two giants , India and China . 
Both countries &quot; external sectors have clearly been hit hard , while domestic consumption is stagnating . 
Fixed-asset investment in India rose by only 2.3 % in the first half of 2012 , compared to 9 % in the year-earlier period . 
Unlike China , which has shown clear signs of stabilization since mid-2012 , there is no clear evidence of recovery in India yet , as delay in implementing necessary reforms , among other factors , has weakened the economy &apos;s competitiveness . 
While recent government measures are expected to boost economic revival , an additional challenge is that growth must be made sustainable and more inclusive , which requires addressing four key issues . 
The first is service-sector upgrades . 
India already has a large service sector , which has been a major source of growth . 
Considering the country &apos;s young and growing population , the service sector needs to create more jobs for the millions who will join the workforce every year . 
But India &apos;s service sector has been dominated by traditional , low-wage output in informal businesses , such as restaurants and personal services . 
To achieve inclusive growth , India must shift toward modern services , such as Internet connectivity technology , finance , law , accountancy , and other professional business services . 
The authorities must reduce burdensome regulations to allow the sector to be more competitive and dynamic ( recent government service sector reform is most welcome ) . 
Second , improvements in the investment climate are vital , especially if India is to realize its potential in manufacturing . 
India needs to expand dramatically the sources and volume of available infrastructure financing . 
This will not be possible without private-sector participation , which requires , in turn , a business environment that ensures adequate return on investment , transparency in procurement , and high-quality governance and regulation . 
Third , while India possesses some of the world &apos;s best managers , scientists , and engineers , a large portion of its workforce is unskilled or semi-skilled , which may constrain the country &apos;s ability to deliver inclusive growth . 
The National Policy on Skill Development marks a welcome shift from the traditional , government-led model of skill development and vocational training to one that emphasizes private-sector-led initiatives . 
Finally , there is the challenge of urbanization . 
Migration to urban centers is causing new cities to emerge and existing ones to expand . 
India must seize the opportunity to adopt green urban planning early on : mass-transport systems should link satellite cities to ports and megacities , and new cities should be eco-friendly and energy-conserving . 
The Indian government &apos;s recent promotion of dynamic economic corridors between major cities is a step in the right direction . 
The Asian Development Bank is working on innovative mechanisms to bring more finance to the infrastructure sector , such as the recent partial credit guarantee facility set up by India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited in collaboration with the ADB . By boosting the credit ratings of infrastructure projects via credit enhancements , this facility will allow pension funds and insurers to invest in infrastructure projects . 
A large share of our assistance is focused on India &apos;s lagging states , making our work strongly inclusive . 
Moreover , the ADB &apos;s support includes skills development , particularly to foster skills required by the infrastructure sectors , and strengthening skills design and delivery systems . 
The ADB is also exploring possibilities for focusing a subset of our operations around a few high-priority economic corridors , which leads naturally to the issue of regional cooperation and integration . 
With India playing a major role , the benefits of cooperation are immense , both within South Asia and across the continent more broadly . 
Greater regional cooperation can help South Asia to achieve shared prosperity that is both inclusive and sustainable . 
Indeed , only 5.4 % of South Asia &apos;s current trade flows are intra-regional , compared to 51 % in East Asia . 
Major hurdles include poor transport connectivity and stifling non-tariff barriers , which impede growth and undermine welfare in Nepal , Bhutan , Bangladesh , and north-eastern India . 
With strong support from India , the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program , known as SASEC , has achieved much success in prioritizing trade facilitation ; developing regional road and rail projects in Nepal , Bhutan , Bangladesh , and India ; and agreeing on a time-bound investment program , including investment in the Siliguri corridor connecting India &apos;s north-eastern states with the rest of the country . 
Improved connectivity and trade will not only boost growth , but also promises an economic lifeline for millions of poor people . 
India is expected to continue to benefit from its so-called demographic dividend and to lead global growth in the coming decades . 
Everybody sees the country &apos;s enormous potential . 
Timely reforms on key issues will open the door to a bright future for its people .
