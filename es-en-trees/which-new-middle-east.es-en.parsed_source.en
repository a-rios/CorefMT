Which New Middle East ? 
BERLIN - Regardless of whether democratization in the &quot; new Middle East &quot; succeeds or authoritarian forms of government prevail once again , one fundamental change has already become clear : no one will be able to govern without taking into account domestic public opinion . 
This change will shift the foreign-policy parameters of the Middle East conflict ( understood as both an Israeli-Palestinian conflict and as a conflict between Israelis and Arabs more generally ) . 
Despite wars in Lebanon and Gaza , and the intifadas in the occupied West Bank , these parameters have proven surprisingly stable for decades , anchored by the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan and the Oslo accords with the Palestinians . 
All this is about to change . 
And , while the tectonic shift in the region was triggered by the &quot; Arab Awakening , &quot; its players are not limited to the Arab world or to the confines of the Middle East conflict . 
The United States , Europe , Turkey , and , in a certain sense , Iran all play a role - some more directly than others . 
Let &apos;s begin with the US . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s speech in Cairo two years ago created great expectations , but few or none have been fulfilled . 
Instead , the US allowed a political vacuum to form in the absence of any movement on the part of Israel &apos;s government . 
This vacuum has now been filled by the Arab Awakening . 
Europe , meanwhile , is preoccupied with its own crisis . 
But , in the last few years , the Europeans , led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy , have de facto slammed the door to European Union accession in Turkey &apos;s face . 
As a result , Turkey has embraced a &quot; neo-Ottoman &quot; foreign policy , in which the Arab world - even more than the Caucasus , Central Asia , and the Balkans - plays the central role . 
Of course , Turkey , in accordance with its political , security , and economic interests , has no choice but to pay close attention to its southern neighborhood , and must try to prevent chaotic developments there . 
Turkey would be facing the same risks even if it were integrated into a European context , but its priorities would then be completely different . 
Because of Europe &apos;s short-sightedness , Turkey has in effect abandoned its ambitions for EU membership and opted for the neo-Ottoman project of becoming a Middle Eastern power - a policy shift that reflects both interests and ideology . 
On the one hand , Turkey views regional dominance as a stepping-stone to a greater global role ; on the other hand , it views itself as a role model for successful modernization of the Middle East on an Islamic-democratic basis . 
This bid for regional preeminence will sooner or later bring Turkey into serious conflict with neighboring Iran . 
If Turkey prevails , Iran and the radicals in the region will be caught on the losing side of history - and they know it . 
While Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s government is trying to maintain good relations with Iran , its ambition to become the leading Sunni power means that Turkey must sooner or later contest Iran &apos;s influence in Iraq , as well as in Syria and Palestine . 
And that means conflict . 
The drastic deterioration in Turkey &apos;s relations with Israel is related to this emerging Iranian-Turkish rivalry . 
To be sure , this rivalry also has a positive side from the Israeli point of view - the weakening of Iran and other regional radicals . 
But , for Turkey as an aspiring regional leader , the interests of the Palestinians are naturally more important than its relations with Israel . 
This has become all the more true in light of the revolutionary changes in the Arab world , and is at the root of Erdoğan &apos;s foreign-policy reorientation . 
As a result , Israel is in an increasingly difficult situation . 
Without a strategic re-orientation of its own - to remain passive is a risky endeavor in a rapidly changing world order - Israel would further delegitimize and isolate itself internationally . 
A viable Israeli answer to the dramatic changes in the region - and to their already foreseeable consequences - can only take the form of a serious offer of negotiations to Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s Palestinian government , with the objective of signing a comprehensive peace treaty . 
Security questions must be taken seriously , but they carry less and less weight , because a sufficiently long period can be left between the treaty &apos;s conclusion and its full implementation to resolve them by mutual agreement . 
But Israel &apos;s current passivity - with all of its negative long-term consequences for the country - is likely to continue as long as Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu considers his coalition &apos;s survival more important than a decisive peace initiative . 
At the same time , the pressure of the Arab revolutions is transforming the Palestinians into a dynamic political factor . 
For example , in view of the looming fall of Syria &apos;s President Bashar al-Assad , the pressure of the Egyptian revolution , and the new role of Islamism in the region , Hamas &apos;s alliance with Iran is becoming increasingly problematic . 
It remains to be seen whether , in the end , the &quot; Turkish course &quot; will prevail against the radicals in Gaza or not . 
In any case , Hamas faces some risky and consequential decisions of its own - all the more so should its main rival , Abbas &apos;s Palestinian Authority , succeed in its current diplomatic campaign at the United Nations . 
Obama had promised a Palestinian state within one year , and Abbas is now building upon that promise . 
But what happens next is crucial . 
Will Abbas be able to keep the Palestinians on a diplomatic path , or will the situation degenerate again into violence and another disaster ? 
And what will the Palestinian road towards peace look like after the UN decision to recognize some form of statehood for Palestine ? 
Given the current pace of change in the Middle East , we might not have to wait long for answers - or for more questions .
