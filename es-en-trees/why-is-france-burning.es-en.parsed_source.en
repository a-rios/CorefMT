Why is France Burning ? 
The urban disturbances in France have been called the most severe since the riots by students and workers in 1968 . 
While the 1968 protests challenged the French Republican model to live up to its finest aspirations , today &apos;s crisis challenges the French Revolution &apos;s model of citizenship and integration itself . 
The French Republican model asserts that all French citizens have the same cultural identity . 
Indeed , this is the only acceptable identity . 
To achieve this shared identity , all citizens have to speak the one official language and be educated according to a common curriculum . 
But they also enjoy equal rights , and have the same duties , in the public arena . 
All this is not only fostered by the state , but also requires the kind of uniformity that only a centralized state can impose . 
Indeed , the French Revolution &apos;s ideological commitment to unity was so strong that during parts of the nineteenth century , advocating federalism was a capital offense . 
Three components of this model incited today &apos;s crisis and make it difficult for the French Republic to address it effectively . 
The first component is the classic French Republican prohibition on gathering data in the official census - or by government agencies or public or private enterprises - on ethnicity , religion , and even social class . 
Collecting these data would , it is argued , violate the Republican tenet that France is &quot; one and indivisible . &quot; 
But the absence of a secondary breakdown of such data , like the UK-style , four-fold class analysis ( plus examination of patterns of unemployment by ethnicity or religion ) , makes it hard for social workers , public heath officials , and economic planners to diagnose new problems . 
Without the necessary data for analysis , public health policies , for example , cannot be directed toward groups that are especially disadvantaged or otherwise at risk . 
The second factor is the classic French Republican rejection of , and legal norms against , any form of &quot; affirmative action , &quot; or positive discrimination , even of the most inoffensive kind . 
Like the prohibition of fine-tuned data - without which positive discrimination is in any case impossible - affirmative action is seen as damaging to the Republican model because it is based on recognition of ethnic differences . 
The third component is the post-welfare state , which is now part of the French model of citizenship and guarantees all full-time employees one of the highest minimum wages in the world and high employer-paid benefits . 
This makes it extremely difficult to let workers go , which makes employers reluctant to hire new people in the first place . 
Many of the social-democratic countries of Europe , like Sweden , Holland , and Denmark , created similar norms in their full-employment eras . 
Unlike France , however , they also used census data to identify pockets of new unemployment , and to invest socially and politically , not only in excellent job-training programs , but in job creation , and , just as importantly , in job-placement schemes . 
France is now very bad at creating new jobs . 
It has few training programs , but high benefits for the unemployed and strong restrictions against firing workers . 
Put all of this together , and it is like slamming a door in the face of young minority men looking for work . 
This is the primary cause of the 30-50 % unemployment rates among minorities aged 16-24 in many French &quot; urban zones of sensitivity . &quot; 
Thus , the riots that France is now seeing emerge from French policies , not from instigations by Islamists . 
France has simply failed to incorporate minority citizens - many of them third-generation immigrants who have been educated for twenty years in assimilationist public schools . 
But few political leaders accept that the crisis has anything to do with the French model of citizenship . 
Indeed , they confidently wait for assimilation to kick in . 
France is only now beginning to come to grips with the crisis of its Republican model of equal citizenship . 
A newly created Minister of Social Cohesion has begun to commission studies documenting discrimination . 
One study showed that for similarly qualified job applicants , those with an Islamic-sounding name , and an address in an ethnically segmented suburb , had only one-fifth the chance of even getting an interview as people with a French-sounding name and a &quot; safe &quot; address . 
Two hundred and fifty of the largest private and public enterprises have created an organization aimed at working with the government to allow them , for the first time ever , to document , and then redress , their discriminatory employment practices . 
Fortunately , organized Muslim leaders so far have not aggravated the rioting . 
Of course , the government &apos;s reduction of community policing in favor of paramilitary forces stationed in quasi-military barracks , and the Minister of Interior &apos;s description of the young rioters as &quot; scum &quot; who should be washed away with an industrial power hose , has not helped . 
The French Republican model enshrines the laudable abstract principles of liberty , equality , and fraternity . 
However , so long as second- and third-generation minority citizens are taught that the only acceptable cultural identity is French , but are not in fact accepted as French - indeed , are blocked from enjoying the full rights of French citizenship - the Republican model will fuel alienation rather than democratic integration .
