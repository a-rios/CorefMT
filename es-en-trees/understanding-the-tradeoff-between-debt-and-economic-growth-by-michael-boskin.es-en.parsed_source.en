The Debt-Growth Controversy 
STANFORD - The recent controversy over errors in a 2010 paper by the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff is a sad commentary on the demands of the 24 / 7 news cycle and the politically toxic atmosphere surrounding fiscal policy in the United States , Europe , and Japan . 
In their paper , &quot; Growth in a Time of Debt , &quot; Reinhart and Rogoff estimated large declines in growth associated with public-debt / GDP ratios above 90 % . 
But it contained coding errors discovered by a University of Massachusetts graduate student . 
When corrected , the effect is substantially smaller , but nonetheless economically consequential . 
The Reinhart / Rogoff paper is just a small part of a voluminous academic literature that shows high debt levels to be economically risky . 
A more fundamental question is causality : the state of the economy certainly affects the fiscal position , just as taxation , spending , deficits , and debts may affect economic growth . 
Research errors in economics are not uncommon , but they are usually caught at an early stage , as happened once to me in a prepublication draft . 
Sometimes errors are not discovered until later , when they are working papers , as with Reinhart and Rogoff , or after publication , as with Nobel laureate Ken Arrow , who had to correct a mistake in the proof of his famous impossibility theorem . 
Economists use different methods to analyze fiscal issues : stylized analytical models ; macroeconometric models fitted to aggregate data , such as those used by the Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , and the US Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) ; empirical estimation of key parameters , such as spending multipliers ; vector autoregressions ; and historical studies . 
Each of these approaches has its strengths and weaknesses , and serious economists and policymakers do not rely on a single study ; rather , they base their judgments on complementary bodies of evidence . 
Thus , there is no excuse for the outrage , the exaggerated claims for one paper &apos;s influence , and the attempt to use the error to discredit legitimate concerns over high levels of debt ( let alone to vilify the authors ) . 
While large deficits are usually undesirable , sometimes they can be benign or even desirable , such as in recession , wartime , or when used to finance productive public investment . 
In normal times , deficits crowd out private investment ( and perhaps crowd in private saving and / or foreign capital ) , and hence reduce future growth . 
By contrast , in a deep , long-lasting recession , with the central bank &apos;s policy rate at the zero lower bound ( ZLB ) , a well-timed , sensible fiscal response can , in principle , be helpful . 
But the political process may generate poorly timed or ineffective responses - focused on transfers rather than purchases , infra-marginal tax rebates , and spending that fails cost-benefit tests - that do little good in the short run and cause substantial harm later . 
America &apos;s 2008 stimulus barely budged consumption upward , and the 2009 fiscal stimulus cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per job - many times higher than median pay . 
We should adopt policies that benefit the economy in the short run at reasonable long-run cost , and reject those that do not . 
That sounds simple , but it is a much higher hurdle than politicians in Europe and the US have set for themselves in recent years . 
I estimated the impact on GDP of America &apos;s recent and projected debt increase ( in which the explosive growth of public spending on pensions and health care looms largest ) , using four alternative estimates of the effect of debt on growth : a smaller Reinhart / Rogoff estimate from a more recent paper ; a widely used International Monetary Fund study , which finds a larger impact ( and which deals with the potential reverse-causality problem ) ; a related CBO study ; and a simple production function with government debt crowding out tangible capital . 
The results were quite similar : unless entitlement costs are brought under control , the resulting rise in debt will cut US living standards by roughly 20 % in a generation . 
Corroborating statistical evidence shows that high deficits and debt increase long-run interest rates . 
The effect is greater when modest deficit and debt levels are exceeded and current-account deficits are large . 
The increased interest rates are likely to retard private investment , which lowers future growth in employment and wages . 
Numerous studies show that government spending &quot; multipliers , &quot; even when large at the ZLB , shrink rapidly , then turn negative - and may even be negative during economic expansions and when households expect higher taxes beyond the ZLB period . 
Permanent tax cuts and those on marginal rates have proved more likely to increase growth than spending increases or temporary , infra-marginal tax rebates ; successful fiscal consolidations have emphasized spending cuts over tax hikes by a ratio of five or six to one ; and spending cuts have been less likely than tax increases to cause recessions in OECD countries . 
Some argue that fiscal consolidation by gradual permanent reductions in spending would be expansionary for high-debt countries , as occurred in some historical episodes . 
Others maintain that a temporary increase in spending now would boost growth . 
Both could be expansionary - or not , depending on details and circumstances . 
Because many countries have been consolidating simultaneously , interest rates are already low ; and , for the US , which accounts for more than 20 % of the global economy and issues the global reserve currency , caution in generalizing from other fiscal episodes is highly advisable . 
Nonetheless , the evidence clearly suggests that high debt / GDP ratios eventually impede long-term growth ; fiscal consolidation should be phased in gradually as economies recover ; and the consolidation needs to be primarily on the spending side of the budget . 
Finally , the notion that we can wait 10-15 years to start dealing with deficits and debt , as economist Paul Krugman has suggested , is beyond irresponsible .
