Europe \ u0027s Moment in Iraq Has Arrived 
The formal end of America &apos;s occupation of Iraq , with sovereignty transferred to an Iraqi government , provides Europe with a chance to play a serious role in determining the future of that vital nation . 
The European Union must get off the sidelines and act , both to assure that the transitional government holds elections and creates a viable Iraqi state , and to preserve Europe &apos;s own interests and values in the region . 
The total failure of the Bush administration &apos;s Iraq policy has opened the door for Europe to offer a serious alternative vision for Iraq &apos;s future . 
Of course , it is tempting for Europe not to propose or do anything , and simply wait for the Iraqi crisis to sweep John Kerry into the White House and George Bush back to Texas . 
A policy of &quot; the worse the better &quot; is simply not acceptable : it mirrors the cynicism that the US administration is rightly criticized of adopting . 
The EU should present its own policy proposal in the context of the debate now taking place within the UN , and it should outline the conditions that the US would have to accept if it truly wants to find a way out of the crisis and ensure active European involvement . 
This requires that Europe &apos;s proposal be universally understood and embraced . 
Only a common European position - Britain included - has any chance of influencing the Bush administration . 
Those who believe that &quot; preventive &quot; war is the worst possible medicine should show that there has always been an alternative based on the principles and regional options that led them to oppose the military intervention in Iraq . 
That intervention exemplifies the failure of the &quot; wounded beast &quot; theory of diplomacy , according to which the US could do anything after the terrorist attacks of 2001 , with the ends justifying the means . 
The senseless intervention in Iraq and the torture of prisoners in Guantánamo , Iraq , and Afghanistan follow the logic of this theory . 
But a policy based on arrogance cannot create conditions that support building democracy in Iraq or effectively combating terrorism . 
In the case of both policies , efficacy is synonymous with legitimacy , which is thus an essential condition for success . 
This was as true yesterday as it is today . 
To resolve the Iraqi crisis and to consolidate a democratic system effectively means that the neo-conservative vision of imposing democracy will have been defeated . 
Europe cannot once again remain passive in the face of an issue that is of such crucial importance for the international order , especially one that is in its own neighborhood . 
At the same time , however , Europe cannot become politically engaged without the right political conditions in place . 
If the EU accepts a merely cosmetic change in US policy , not only will it fail to contribute to resolving the crisis , but its actions and image will also be contaminated by the anti-Americanism that dominates the region . 
The first condition for European engagement , and the only guarantee of domestic legitimacy , is that the new transitional Iraqi government be politically independent of the US-led Coalition . 
Once domestic legitimacy has been achieved , international legitimacy can be generated by the UN &apos;s assumption of a truly leading role in managing all aspects of international support in Iraq ( political , economic , and security related ) . 
The UN can begin to adopt this role by organizing an International Conference for Iraq that involves the Arab nations . 
There can be no meaningful reconstruction or appropriate conditions to hold elections without security ( Europe already contributes € 200 million annually to reconstruction ) . 
The US must remain militarily involved - although it is the problem there today , it must also be a vital part of the solution . 
But security cannot remain essentially in the hands of the Coalition . 
The US must ultimately accept an East Timor-style solution for Iraq . 
What does that mean ? 
Initially , Australia guaranteed security in East Timor after its independence from Indonesia , and later accepted that it should continue to play a major role , but within a UN framework and under UN command . 
It is possible that Europe could build up a strong presence in Iraq , including a military presence , if a future democratically elected Iraqi government should request it . 
Finally , as stated repeatedly since the start of the war , there can be no success in Iraq without a strong Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative . 
A European plan for Iraq must call for international intervention to enforce the Geneva accords through a process along the lines of the Dayton Agreements that ended the Bosnian war . 
It remains to be seen whether the Bush administration , in the midst of an election , can be called to reason and persuaded that only a policy along the lines I have outlined stands a chance of stabilizing Iraq . 
If the Bush administration will not change course , that is all the more reason for Americans to change their president .
