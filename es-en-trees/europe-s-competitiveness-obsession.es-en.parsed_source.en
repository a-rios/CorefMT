Europe &apos;s Competitiveness Obsession 
BRUSSELS - The President of the European Central Bank is said to show at each meeting of the European Council a graph depicting the evolution of relative wage costs across the eurozone &apos;s 16 member countries . 
This chart shows increasing divergences over the last ten years , with the countries now facing difficulties ( Greece , Portugal , and Spain ) having lost competitiveness by around 20 % relative to Germany . 
In other words , since 1999 , wage costs have increased by about 20 % less in Germany than in southern Europe . 
The conclusion seems straightforward . 
The eurozone &apos;s southern European members must reduce their wage costs to claw back the competitiveness that they have lost since adopting the common currency . 
Concern about such divergences has also reached the task force headed by European Union President Herman Van Rompuy , which is supposed to devise fundamental reforms to the rules for economic policy coordination within the EU . 
A key proposal from the task force &apos;s first meeting was to develop competitiveness indicators , and then force member countries to take &quot; remedial action &quot; should the EU find large divergences . 
But this approach risks leading in the wrong direction . 
Competitiveness , which is usually measured in terms of unit labor costs , is a relative concept . 
One country &apos;s gain is another &apos;s loss . 
Restoring competitiveness in some member countries ( Spain , Greece ) would require others ( Germany in the first instance ) to accept deterioration in theirs . 
The adjustment might come about through wage increases in countries with lower labor costs , rather than cuts in countries where costs are too high . 
The official response to this is that no country should be forced to increase wages , and that everybody gains if structural reforms increase productivity . 
The latter is certainly true , but it does not solve the fundamental problem - that a country &apos;s relative unit labor costs can decline only if another country &apos;s rise . 
Even assuming that agreement can be found within the eurozone on how to allocate the desired gains and losses in competitiveness across countries , member countries are not centrally planned economies . 
There is little that government can do in a market economy to force down wages in the private sector . 
Governments can , of course , enforce public-sector wage cuts . 
This is being done on a large scale in Greece and Spain , for example . 
But there is little empirical evidence that public-sector wages have a significant impact on private-sector wage growth . 
So is higher productivity the way out ? 
Even assuming that governments could identify and implement structural reforms that yielded quick productivity gains , it is not clear that higher productivity leads to increased competitiveness . 
In fact , across the EU , the opposite often is true . 
Some of the countries that achieved the highest growth in labor productivity also lost the most competitiveness ( e.g. Ireland ) . 
How is this possible ? 
After all , higher productivity should bring lower unit labor costs . 
But improvements in productivity are easily overwhelmed by changes in wages . 
While productivity growth usually is measured in fractions of a percentage point , wage increases have been much larger . 
So the real question is , What drives wages ? 
Country-level data suggest that the largest wage increases over the last decade are generally associated with the strongest growth in domestic demand ( e.g. Spain , Greece ) . 
Are wages driving demand , or vice versa ? 
Most of the loss of competitiveness in southern Europe occurred once unemployment there had fallen significantly . 
The measured loss of competitiveness in southern Europe thus should not be ascribed to a lack of structural reforms or unreasonable trade unions , but rather booms in domestic demand , fueled mainly by the easy availability of cheap credit for consumption ( Greece ) and construction ( Spain , Ireland ) . 
This excessive consumption and construction demand led to excess demand for labor , especially in protected sectors like services , thus driving up wage costs . 
If excessive domestic demand was the problem , the solution should now be on its way . 
International capital markets already have curtailed credit to these countries . 
The sharp fiscal retrenchment that has now started throughout southern Europe should contribute further to a sharp deceleration , if not outright fall , in domestic demand there . 
If labor markets are flexible , this should result in lower wages . 
Indeed , that is the key condition : labor-market flexibility on the way down as much as on the way up . 
Adjustment would be much easier , of course , if wages did not fall in Germany as well . 
But , given that unemployment is actually declining in Germany , which in the past has tended to increase wages ( moderately ) , this is unlikely . 
The proposition that governments &quot; must do something about competitiveness &quot; risks leading to an excessively activist approach to economic policy coordination , with governments and EU institutions constantly trying to influence wage-setting in the private sector . 
This might work - at least partly - in the current crisis , but it will not be able to prevent future divergences in competitiveness if domestic demand diverges again . 
Structural reforms are always useful , but increasing productivity takes a long time and does not always translate into higher competitiveness . 
What is needed in southern Europe is acceptance that domestic demand must fall to a level that allows countries to live without further capital inflows . 
After that , it should be sufficient to allow labor markets to work until the system finds its new equilibrium .
