From Welfare State to Innovation State 
PRINCETON - A specter is haunting the world economy - the specter of job-killing technology . 
How this challenge is met will determine the fate of the world &apos;s market economies and democratic polities , in much the same way that Europe &apos;s response to the rise of the socialist movement during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries shaped the course of subsequent history . 
When the new industrial working class began to organize , governments defused the threat of revolution from below that Karl Marx had prophesied by expanding political and social rights , regulating markets , erecting a welfare state that provided extensive transfers and social insurance , and smoothing the ups and downs of the macroeconomy . 
In effect , they reinvented capitalism to make it more inclusive and to give workers a stake in the system . 
Today &apos;s technological revolutions call for a similarly comprehensive reinvention . 
The potential benefits of discoveries and new applications in robotics , biotechnology , digital technologies and other areas are all around us and easy to see . 
Indeed , many believe that the world economy may be on the cusp of another explosion in new technologies . 
The trouble is that the bulk of these new technologies are labor-saving . 
They entail the replacement of low- and medium-skilled workers with machines operated by a much smaller number of highly skilled workers . 
To be sure , some low-skill tasks cannot be easily automated . 
Janitors , to cite a common example , cannot be replaced by robots - at least not yet . 
But few jobs are really protected from technological innovation . 
Consider , for example , that there will be less human-generated trash - and thus less demand for janitors - as the workplace is digitized . 
A world in which robots and machines do the work of humans need not be a world of high unemployment . 
But it is certainly a world in which the lion &apos;s share of productivity gains accrues to the owners of the new technologies and the machines that embody them . 
The bulk of the workforce is condemned either to joblessness or low wages . 
Indeed , something like this has been happening in the developed countries for at least four decades . 
Skill and capital-intensive technologies are the leading culprit behind the rise in inequality since the late 1970s . 
By all indications , this trend is likely to continue , producing historically unprecedented levels of inequality and the threat of widespread social and political conflict . 
It doesn &apos;t have to be this way . 
With some creative thinking and institutional engineering , we can save capitalism from itself - once again . 
The key is to recognize that disruptive new technologies produce large social gains and private losses simultaneously . 
These gains and losses can be reconfigured in a manner that benefits everyone . 
Just as with the earlier reinvention of capitalism , the state must play a large role . 
Consider how new technologies develop . 
Each potential innovator faces a large upside , but also a high degree of risk . 
If the innovation is successful , its pioneer reaps a large gain , as does society at large . 
But if it fails , the innovator is out of luck . 
Among all the new ideas that are pursued , only a few eventually become commercially successful . 
These risks are especially high at the dawn of a new innovation age . 
Achieving the socially desirable level of innovative effort then requires either foolhardy entrepreneurs - who are willing to take high risks - or a sufficient supply of risk capital . 
Financial markets in the advanced economies provide risk capital through different sets of arrangements - venture funds , public trading of shares , private equity , etc . 
But there is no reason why the state should not be playing this role on an even larger scale , enabling not only greater amounts of technological innovation but also channeling the benefits directly to society at large . 
As Mariana Mazzucato has pointed out , the state already plays a significant role in funding new technologies . 
The Internet and many of the key technologies used in the iPhone have been spillovers of government subsidized R D programs and US Department of Defense projects . 
But typically the government acquires no stake in the commercialization of such successful technologies , leaving the profits entirely to private investors . 
Imagine that a government established a number of professionally managed public venture funds , which would take equity stakes in a large cross-section of new technologies , raising the necessary funds by issuing bonds in financial markets . 
These funds would operate on market principles and have to provide periodic accounting to political authorities ( especially when their overall rate of return falls below a specified threshold ) , but would be otherwise autonomous . 
Designing the right institutions for public venture capital can be difficult . 
But central banks offer a model of how such funds might operate independently of day-to-day political pressure . 
Society , through its agent - the government - would then end up as co-owner of the new generation of technologies and machines . 
The public venture funds &quot; share of profits from the commercialization of new technologies would be returned to ordinary citizens in the form of a &quot; social innovation &quot; dividend - an income stream that would supplement workers &quot; earnings from the labor market . 
It would also allow working hours to be reduced - finally approaching Marx &apos;s dream of a society in which technological progress enables individuals to &quot; hunt in the morning , fish in the afternoon , rear cattle in the evening , criticize after dinner . &quot; 
The welfare state was the innovation that democratized - and thereby stabilized - capitalism in the twentieth century . 
The twenty-first century requires an analogous shift to the &quot; innovation state . &quot; 
The welfare state &apos;s Achilles &quot; heel was that it required a high level of taxation without stimulating a compensating investment in innovative capacity . 
An innovation state , established along the lines sketched above , would reconcile equity with the incentives that such investment requires .
