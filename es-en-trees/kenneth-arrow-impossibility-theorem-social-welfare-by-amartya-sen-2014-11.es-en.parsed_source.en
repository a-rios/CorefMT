Social Choice and Social Welfare 
CAMBRIDGE - Human beings have always lived in groups , and their individual lives have invariably depended on group decisions . 
But the challenges of group choice can be daunting , particularly given the divergent interests and concerns of the group &apos;s members . 
So , how should collective decision-making be carried out ? 
A dictator who wants to control every aspect of people &apos;s lives will seek to ignore the preferences of everyone else . 
But that level of power is hard to achieve . 
More important , dictatorship of any kind can readily be seen to be a terrible way to govern a society . 
So , for both ethical and practical reasons , social scientists have long investigated how the concerns of a society &apos;s members can be reflected in one way or another in its collective decisions , even if the society is not fully democratic . 
For example , in the fourth century BC , Aristotle in Greece and Kautilya in India explored various possibilities of social choice in their classic books , Politics and Economics , respectively ( the Sanskrit title of Kautilya &apos;s book , Arthashastra , translates literally as &quot; the discipline of material wellbeing &quot; ) . 
The study of social choice as a formal discipline first came into its own in the late eighteenth century , when the subject was pioneered by French mathematicians , particularly J. C. Borda and Marquis de Condorcet . 
The intellectual climate of the time was greatly influenced by the European Enlightenment , with its interest in reasoned construction of a social order , and its commitment to the creation of a society responsive to people &apos;s preferences . 
But the theoretical investigations of Borda , Condorcet , and others often yielded rather pessimistic results . 
For example , the so-called &quot; voting paradox &quot; presented by Condorcet showed that majority rule can reach an impasse when every alternative is defeated in voting by some other alternative , so that no alternative is capable of standing up to the challenge of every other alternative . 
Social choice theory in its modern and systematic form owes its rigorous foundation to the work of Kenneth J. Arrow in his 1950 Columbia University PhD dissertation . 
Arrow &apos;s thesis contained his famous &quot; impossibility theorem , &quot; an analytical result of breathtaking elegance and reach . 
Arrow &apos;s theorem shows that even very mild conditions of reasonableness in arriving at social decisions on the basis of simple preference rankings of a society &apos;s individuals could not be simultaneously satisfied by any procedure . 
When the book based on his dissertation , Social Choice and Individual Values , was published in 1951 , it became an instant classic . 
Economists , political theorists , moral and political philosophers , sociologists , and even the general public rapidly took notice of what seemed like - and indeed was - a devastating result . 
Two centuries after visions of social rationality flowered in Enlightenment thinking , the project suddenly seemed , at least superficially , to be inescapably doomed . 
It is important to understand why and how Arrow &apos;s impossibility result comes about . 
Scrutiny of the formal reasoning that establishes the theorem shows that relying only on the preference rankings of individuals makes it difficult to distinguish between very dissimilar social choice problems . 
The usability of available information is further reduced by the combined effects of innocuous-seeming principles that are popular in informal discussions . 
It is essential , particularly for making judgments about social welfare , to compare different individuals &quot; gains and losses and to take note of their relative affluence , which cannot be immediately deduced only from people &apos;s rankings of social alternatives . 
It is also important to examine which types of clusters of preference rankings are problematic for different types of voting procedures . 
Nonetheless , Arrow &apos;s impossibility theorem ultimately played a hugely constructive role in investigating what democracy demands , which goes well beyond counting votes ( important as that is ) . 
Enriching the informational base of democracy and making greater use of interactive public reasoning can contribute significantly to making democracy more workable , and also allow reasoned assessment of social welfare . 
Social choice theory has thus become a broad discipline , covering a variety of distinct questions . 
Under what circumstances would majority rule yield unambiguous and consistent decisions ? 
How robust are the different voting procedures for yielding cogent results ? 
How can we judge how well a society as a whole is doing in light of its members &quot; disparate interests ? 
How , moreover , can we accommodate individuals &quot; rights and liberties while giving appropriate recognition to their overall preferences ? 
How do we measure aggregate poverty in view of the varying predicaments and miseries of the diverse people who comprise the society ? 
How do we arrive at social valuations of public goods such as the natural environment ? 
Beyond these questions , a theory of justice can draw substantially on the insights and analytical results emerging from social choice theory ( as I discussed in my 2009 book The Idea of Justice ) . 
Furthermore , the understanding generated by social choice theorists &quot; study of group decisions has helped some research that is not directly a part of social choice theory - for example , on the forms and consequences of gender inequality , or on the causation and prevention of famines . 
The reach and relevance of social choice theory is extensive . 
Rather than undermining the pursuit of social reasoning , Arrow &apos;s deeply challenging impossibility theorem , and the large volume of literature that it has inspired , has immensely strengthened our ability to think rationally about the collective decision-making on which our survival and happiness depend .
