Alternatives to Austerity 
NEW YORK - In the aftermath of the Great Recession , countries have been left with unprecedented peacetime deficits and increasing anxieties about their growing national debts . 
In many countries , this is leading to a new round of austerity - policies that will almost surely lead to weaker national and global economies and a marked slowdown in the pace of recovery . 
Those hoping for large deficit reductions will be sorely disappointed , as the economic slowdown will push down tax revenues and increase demands for unemployment insurance and other social benefits . 
The attempt to restrain the growth of debt does serve to concentrate the mind - it forces countries to focus on priorities and assess values . 
The United States is unlikely in the short term to embrace massive budget cuts , à la the United Kingdom . 
But the long-term prognosis - made especially dire by health-care reform &apos;s inability to make much of a dent in rising medical costs - is sufficiently bleak that there is increasing bipartisan momentum to do something . 
President Barack Obama has appointed a bipartisan deficit-reduction commission , whose chairmen recently provided a glimpse of what their report might look like . 
Technically , reducing a deficit is a straightforward matter : one must either cut expenditures or raise taxes . 
It is already clear , however , that the deficit-reduction agenda , at least in the US , goes further : it is an attempt to weaken social protections , reduce the progressivity of the tax system , and shrink the role and size of government - all while leaving established interests , like the military-industrial complex , as little affected as possible . 
In the US ( and some other advanced industrial countries ) , any deficit-reduction agenda has to be set in the context of what happened over the last decade : 
· a massive increase in defense expenditures , fueled by two fruitless wars , but going well beyond that ; 
· growth in inequality , with the top 1 % garnering more than 20 % of the country &apos;s income , accompanied by a weakening of the middle class - median US household income has fallen by more than 5 % over the past decade , and was in decline even before the recession ; 
· underinvestment in the public sector , including in infrastructure , evidenced so dramatically by the collapse of New Orleans &quot; levies ; and 
· growth in corporate welfare , from bank bailouts to ethanol subsidies to a continuation of agricultural subsidies , even when those subsidies have been ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization . 
As a result , it is relatively easy to formulate a deficit-reduction package that boosts efficiency , bolsters growth , and reduces inequality . 
Five core ingredients are required . 
First , spending on high-return public investments should be increased . 
Even if this widens the deficit in the short run , it will reduce the national debt in the long run . 
What business wouldn &apos;t jump at investment opportunities yielding returns in excess of 10 % if it could borrow capital - as the US government can - for less than 3 % interest ? 
Second , military expenditures must be cut - not just funding for the fruitless wars , but also for the weapons that don &apos;t work against enemies that don &apos;t exist . 
We &apos;ve continued as if the Cold War never came to an end , spending as much on defense as the rest of the world combined . 
Following this is the need to eliminate corporate welfare . 
Even as America has stripped away its safety net for people , it has strengthened the safety net for firms , evidenced so clearly in the Great Recession with the bailouts of AIG , Goldman Sachs , and other banks . 
Corporate welfare accounts for nearly one-half of total income in some parts of US agro-business , with billions of dollars in cotton subsidies , for example , going to a few rich farmers - while lowering prices and increasing poverty among competitors in the developing world . 
An especially egregious form of corporate special treatment is that afforded to the drug companies . 
Even though the government is the largest buyer of their products , it is not allowed to negotiate prices , thereby fueling an estimated increase in corporate revenues - and costs to the government - approaching $ 1 trillion dollars over a decade . 
Another example is the smorgasbord of special benefits provided to the energy sector , especially oil and gas , thereby simultaneously robbing the treasury , distorting resource allocation , and destroying the environment . 
Then there are the seemingly endless giveaways of national resources - from the free spectrum provided to broadcasters to the low royalties levied on mining companies to the subsidies to lumber companies . 
Creating a fairer and more efficient tax system , by eliminating the special treatment of capital gains and dividends , is also needed . 
Why should those who work for a living be subject to higher tax rates than those who reap their livelihood from speculation ( often at the expense of others ) ? 
Finally , with more than 20 % of all income going to the top 1 % , a slight increase , say 5 % , in taxes actually paid would bring in more than $ 1 trillion over the course of a decade . 
A deficit-reduction package crafted along these lines would more than meet even the most ardent deficit hawk &apos;s demands . 
It would increase efficiency , promote growth , improve the environment , and benefit workers and the middle class . 
There &apos;s only one problem : it wouldn &apos;t benefit those at the top , or the corporate and other special interests that have come to dominate America &apos;s policymaking . 
Its compelling logic is precisely why there is little chance that such a reasonable proposal would ever be adopted .
