Whose War on Terror ? 
&quot; We are all Americans , &quot; wrote Le Monde on September 12 , 2001 . And so it was with most people in the Muslim world , who were as appalled as anyone else at the carnage of the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York . 
Indeed , when America responded to the attacks , almost no one mourned the fall of the Taliban , who were universally condemned for their fanaticism . 
This unanimity of opinion no longer exists . 
In the five years since the attacks , two audiences for the so-called &quot; war on terror &quot; have emerged . 
Indeed , as the &quot; war &quot; progressed , the audience closest to the action began to see the emerging combat in a way that was diametrically opposed to that of the United States and the West . 
To the US administration , every act in the drama of the war on terror was seen as discrete and self-contained : Afghanistan , Iraq , Palestine , and Hezbollah in Lebanon . 
The Bush administration , having proclaimed a war on terror , invaded and occupied countries , and yet failed to see that these events were being linked in the eyes of people in the region . 
Glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite channels , the various battles of the &quot; war on terror &quot; came to be viewed as a single chain of events in a grand plot against Islam . 
Worse yet , America waved the banner of democracy as it prosecuted its wars . But hopes for democracy , be it secular or Islamist , for the people concerned have been buried in the rubble and carnage of Baghdad , Beirut , and Kandahar . 
Many Muslims understand - as well as anyone in the West , and in the same terms - the underlying causes of the alienation that animates Islamic radicalism and violence . They know that the rigid dictatorships of the region have paralyzed their populations . Only those consumed by the fires of their rage seem able to melt the shackles of these authoritarian societies . 
But the price of escape is a kind of deformation . 
Embittered , fanatical , vengeful : those who rebel against the status quo enter the wider world seeking retaliation , not just against the regimes that deformed them , but against the West , which propped up the region &apos;s authoritarians in the interest of &quot; stability . &quot; 
Many Muslims also understand that the problem of Palestine , unsolved for three generations , goes beyond the suffering of the Palestinian people . They know that the region &apos;s dictators have used Palestine to justify their misrule and to avoid political and economic liberalization . 
So when America called for democracy , the hearts of many in the region soared with the hope that reform would come at last . But America , as so many times before , let them down . 
As people at last began to hope for more liberal and decent societies , the US continued to endorse the regimes that were repressing them . America simply could not adhere to its own democracy-promotion script . 
After the ouster of the Taliban in Afghanistan , the US turned its sights on the secular dictatorship of Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq . Instead of encouraging reform of the Saudi / Wahhabi regime - the system that spawned 15 of the 19 hijackers in the 9 / 11 attacks - the average Muslim saw America as waging war on a regime that had nothing to do with that crime . 
Many Muslims acquiesced in this deviation , viewing the invasion of Iraq as part of the passing of dictatorship and the coming of democracy . But the bloodstained shambles of the US occupation led America to abandon the quest for democracy . 
The deeper America sank into the Iraqi quagmire , the more the US began to turn a blind eye to the region &apos;s surviving dictators , particularly those in Saudi Arabia , Syria , Egypt , and Pakistan . 
Indeed , the last thing the region &apos;s dictators wanted to see was a democratic Iraq . 
Almost from the moment of Saddam &apos;s fall , Saudi / Wahhabi jihadis poured into Iraq almost unimpeded . 
Worse yet , the Muslims who supported the project to democratize Iraq widely suspect that the Sunni resistance that incited the Iraqi civil war has been financed by Saudi oil money . 
( Terrorism also kept Iraqi oil from becoming a serious challenger to Saudi Arabia . ) 
So the effort to democratize Iraq - indeed , the entire American project to democratize the region - has fallen under deep suspicion by even the most moderate of Muslims . 
America , they believe , only wants a democracy that suits its interests . 
If Palestinians freely vote for Hamas , their choice is actively opposed . 
Lebanon &apos;s &quot; Cedar Revolution , &quot; which galvanized the West in the same way as Ukraine &apos;s Orange Revolution , has been systematically undermined . 
With democracy in most of the region still a long way off - indeed , perhaps a more distant prospect now than five years ago - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeats her mantra that the dead civilians of Beirut , Sidon , Tyre , and Gaza represent the &quot; birth pangs &quot; of a new Middle East . 
But until the West stops regarding dead babies as political props , we cannot understand how the Muslim world perceives all that has happened since September 11 , 2001 . 
Only then will we understand why the unified view of five years ago has fractured so violently .
