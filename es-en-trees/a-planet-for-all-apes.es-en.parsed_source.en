A Planet for All Apes 
MELBOURNE - Two new movies released this month - one a science-fiction blockbuster , the other a revealing documentary - raise the issue of our relations with our closest non-human relatives , the great apes . 
Both dramatize insights and lessons that should not be ignored . 
Rupert Wyatt &apos;s Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the seventh film in a series based on Pierre Boule &apos;s 1963 novel , Planet of the Apes , about a world populated by highly intelligent simians . 
Publicity for the new film claims that it is &quot; the first live-action film in the history of movies to star , and be told from the point of view of , a sentient animal . &quot; 
Yet no live apes were used . 
Instead , &quot; performance capture technology , &quot; originally invented for the movie Avatar , enables a human actor , Andy Serkis , to play the role of the chimpanzee Caesar , not by dressing in a chimp suit , but by having every gesture and facial movement , even the twitch of an eyebrow , transformed into the movement of an ape . 
When I spoke with Wyatt last month , he acknowledged that there were practical reasons for not using real apes in his movie . 
&quot; There are things I didn &apos;t want to be involved in , &quot; he told me . 
&quot; To get apes to do anything you want them to do , you have to dominate them ; you have to manipulate them into performing . 
That &apos;s exploitative . &quot; 
Wyatt &apos;s reluctance to join in the exploitation of great apes is understandable , given that the film itself tells the story of apes rising up in response to oppression from dominant humans . 
The central human character , Will Rodman ( played by James Franco ) , is a scientist seeking a cure for Alzheimer &apos;s disease who experiments on apes . 
Many films would have glorified a scientist seeking such a goal , and treated the use of animals for that purpose as obviously justified . 
Rise of the Planet of the Apes , however , portrays Rodman as , in Franco &apos;s words , &quot; a cold , isolated person . &quot; 
Only when Rodman &apos;s superiors cancel his experiments and he takes home Caesar , an infant chimpanzee , does the scientist begin to care about others . 
The plot then takes another turn when Caesar becomes too big and aggressive to live in a human home , and is taken to what is supposed to be a primate sanctuary , but is in fact a dumping ground for unwanted apes , run by humans who display cruelty to the captive animals . 
As far as the treatment of apes is concerned , much of the film is firmly grounded in reality , as a viewing of Project Nim , a documentary based on Elizabeth Hess &apos;s book Nim Chimpsky : The Chimp Who Would be Human , clearly demonstrates . 
Nim was born in 1973 , in a primate research facility in Oklahoma , and was taken from his mother when he was only ten days old , to be used in a sign-language experiment . 
Reared as part of a human family , he learned to use more than 100 signs from American Sign Language , the language used by Deaf Americans . 
He grew stronger and more aggressive and began biting his teachers . 
Herbert Terrace , the Columbia University psychologist who was directing the project , decided to end it and sent Nim back to the primate facility in Oklahoma . 
There , the pampered chimpanzee - who , when asked to sort photos of humans and apes , put his own photo among the humans - was locked in a cage with other chimps . 
He demonstrated his view of that situation by signing &quot; out &quot; to passing humans . 
Nim suffered various other vicissitudes - and narrowly escaped being infected with hepatitis as part of a medical experiment - until he was eventually released to an animal sanctuary , where he died in 2000 . 
In 1993 , Paola Cavalieri and I founded The Great Ape Project , an organization dedicated to the idea of recognizing that great apes have a moral status befitting their nature as self-aware beings who are capable of thought and have rich and deep emotional lives . 
At a minimum , they should have the rights to life , liberty , and protection from torture that we grant to all members of our own species , regardless of their intellectual abilities . 
In the intervening years , that idea has made steady progress . 
Since 2010 , the European Union has essentially banned the use of great apes in experiments . 
Experiments on great apes are now either banned or severely restricted in New Zealand , Australia , and Japan . 
In the United States , a bipartisan group of members of Congress is supporting legislation to end the use of chimpanzees in invasive research . 
In Spain in 2008 , a parliamentary resolution urged the government to grant some basic legal rights to great apes , but the Spanish government has yet to implement it . 
Perhaps the release of these two very different films will lead to a further push to bring great apes within the circle of beings with moral and legal rights . 
In that way , our closest relatives could serve to bridge the moral gulf that we have dug between ourselves and other animals .
