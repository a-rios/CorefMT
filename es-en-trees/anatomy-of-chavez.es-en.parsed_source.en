Anatomy of Chavez 
Hugo Chavez &apos;s almost 8 years in power in Venezuela - which he will seek to extend in presidential elections next month  -  seems to defy economic analysis . 
Indeed , any and all economic examination of Chavez &apos;s Venezuela confirms Edgar R. Fiedler &apos;s quip that if you &quot; ask five economists something , you will get five answers ... or six if one of them is a Harvard graduate . &quot; 
Some people see in Chavez an innovative statesman who has seized an almost magical moment - the windfall Venezuela has received from today &apos;s sky high oil prices  -  to change the rules of the game in his country . 
A few key indicators appear to support this . 
In that two year period , Chavez stepped on the gas for his social reforms - education , health care , etc . - and also in regard to breaking down the country &apos;s excessive concentrations of wealth . 
Although over 70 % of national income remains in the hands of just 20 % of the population , Chavez has forced big foreign oil companies to pay much higher royalties and has started expropriating unproductive land and industrial facilities . 
With oil prices now six times higher than they were when he came to power , Chavez presided over economic growth of 9 % in 2005 and as much again in the first quarter of 2006 . 
Above all , however , he has achieved a 6.3 % effective reduction of poverty , after taking over a country whose vast majority - 80 % - was perched between poverty and squalor . 
Seen in this angle , Chavez appears to have real achievements . 
But there is another , darker , angle from which to view his presidency . 
It is possible to see in Chavez but another Latin American populist sorcerer &apos;s apprentice , one whose political shelf life will expire whenever oil prices begin their inevitable shift backward . 
To those who think that this is the case , Chavez is not an innovator but someone who is merely squandering Venezuela &apos;s oil wealth in the same way that governments did following the oil shocks of the 1970 &apos;s . 
The notion of specific &quot; Chavist &quot; growth can also be challenged . 
The highest growth achieved in the Chavez years is lower than Venezuela &apos;s average during the second half of the 1990 &apos;s , when oil was the exclusive domain of the private sector . 
Moreover , growth under Chavez seems to reflect an increase in domestic consumption resulting from the flow of petrodollars and nothing more fundamental , as oil remains the economy &apos;s only real engine . 
So nothing Chavez has done translates into a fundamental improvement in , or diversification of , Venezuela &apos;s economy . 
Private investors appear to understand this , as such investment in Venezuela grew by a mere 3 % between 2000 and 2004 . 
Suspiciously , the country &apos;s central bank refuses to publish that figure for 2005 . 
Only one out of every ten Venezuelan companies polled states any intention of making middle or long term investments such as renovating existing industrial plants or building new ones . 
True , businessmen have tempered their criticisms of Chavez and seem eager to participate in the profit feast brought about by increased consumption . 
But they may also be waiting for the first external shock to puncture the Chavez balloon before they pounce . These two versions of the Chavez years are both distorted  -  to a certain degree  -  by nostalgia . 
Those who see him as successful have the 1960 &apos;s and 1970 &apos;s as their dream fantasy . 
Their main arguments are reminiscent the arguments put forward by those who backed the Cuban Revolution . 
Those who revile Chavez often do so in the name of the &quot; Washington Consensus , &quot; that mix of capitalism and democracy that was almost hegemonic across the continent in the 1980 &apos;s and 1990 &apos;s . 
Thus , Chavez is portrayed as a return to the Latin American populist heresy , a heresy that must be resisted because it affects not only the country with the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East , but also because it may tempt the rest of Latin America down that road . 
But history never truly repeats itself . 
The years of the biggest transformation demands in Latin America or those of its docility to economic orthodoxy will not come back because we can remember them . 
Especially , the view of the Washington Consensus seems irretrievable ; its &quot; grand tale &quot; is now beyond the pale in the region &apos;s societies after it did not deliver the promised prosperity . 
Yet one thing is clear : Chavez was the first ruler of his generation to recognize the region &apos;s fatigue and disillusion with neo-liberalism , and to propose new rules of the game . 
In the end these may not be the rules he envisions today , but neither are they a spent force . 
To believe that one can accurately foresee what will become of Chavez and Venezuela brings to mind another warning by Fiedler : &quot; He who lives by the crystal ball must sooner or later learn to chew glass . &quot;
