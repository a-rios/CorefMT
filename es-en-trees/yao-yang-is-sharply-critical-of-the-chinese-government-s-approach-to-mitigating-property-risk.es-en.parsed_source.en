China &apos;s Real-Estate Wrongs 
BEIJING - China &apos;s real-estate sector has been a source of serious concern for several years , with soaring property prices raising fears of overheating in the housing market . 
But , with price growth easing , it seems that the government &apos;s campaign to rein in property risk is finally taking hold . 
The danger now is that the housing market will collapse - bringing China &apos;s economic prospects down with it . 
In its effort to control rising housing prices , China &apos;s government has pursued nine distinct policies , not all of which have served their purpose . 
Though policies like limits on mortgages for first-time buyers and minimum residency requirements for purchasing property in a first-tier city like Beijing or Shanghai helped to ease demand , supply-side tactics , such as limiting credit to real-estate developers and imposing new taxes on property sales , have proved to be counter-productive . 
This flawed approach allowed China &apos;s housing prices to continue to rise steadily , fueling major housing bubbles , especially in first-tier cities . 
The average Beijing resident would have to save all of his or her income for 34 years before to be able to purchase an apartment outright . 
The expectation that this trend will continue has driven homeowners to retain possession of their properties , even though rental rates amount to less than 2 % of a property &apos;s market value . 
But , with the real-estate sector finally facing a downturn , the time to rethink this investment strategy has arrived . 
In the first four months of 2014 , housing sales dropped by nearly 7 % year on year , with construction of new floor area falling by more than 22 % . 
As a result , downward pressure on property prices is mounting . 
In normal times , citizens and officials alike would welcome this trend . 
But , at a time of weakening economic performance , China cannot afford an implosion of the real-estate sector , which accounts for at least 30 % of overall growth . 
Indeed , though China &apos;s government has expressed its willingness to sacrifice some growth in its pursuit of structural reform and rebalancing , the impact of a housing-market collapse on the financial sector would cause growth to slow beyond the acceptable limit . 
That impact partly reflects the highly problematic nature of the Chinese government &apos;s long-awaited move to liberalize interest rates . 
Instead of taking a direct approach - lifting the interest-rate cap imposed on banks - liberalization has been achieved by allowing shadow banking to flourish . 
As a result , a large number of nonbank financial institutions - such as wealth-management companies and online financial-services providers - are now using promises of high returns to attract small investors . 
Making matters worse , the monetary authorities have tightened the credit supply , in an effort to deleverage the Chinese economy . 
While both interest-rate liberalization and deleveraging are critical to the long-term health of China &apos;s economy , the skyrocketing cost of borrowing is forcing many low-risk companies , which are unable to offer sufficiently high rates of return , out of the market . 
At the same time , real-estate developers who have borrowed heavily from shadow-banking institutions , based on the assumption that property prices would continue to rise steadily , may struggle to repay their debts , with a sharp decline in prices inevitably leading to defaults . 
Given that the formal banking sector provides a large share of shadow-banking finance , this could initiate a chain reaction affecting the entire financial sector . 
Many remain convinced that China &apos;s government - which wields with the world &apos;s largest foreign-exchange reserves and virtually unchecked authority - would be able to prevent a major financial crisis . 
But the financial crisis in the fast-growing city of Wenzhou , triggered by bad loans , suggests otherwise - not least because the economy has yet to recover fully . 
There is no reason to believe that a similar crisis could not occur on a national scale . 
To avoid such an outcome , China &apos;s leaders must urgently adopt counter-cyclical measures . 
They should begin by eliminating non-market-based restrictions on the real-estate sector , which have generated serious distortions not only to the economy , but also to people &apos;s lives , with couples divorcing temporarily to gain the right to purchase an additional apartment . 
When it comes to the real-estate sector , China &apos;s government has consistently had the right objective and the wrong strategy . 
It is time to align intention with action . 
Otherwise , China &apos;s financial sector - indeed , its entire economy - will suffer .
