Asian Alternatives to the G7 Bank Bailout 
The trillion-dollar commitments made so far by governments , with the exception of Britain &apos;s , have been biased toward restoring market confidence instead of healing the core of what ails banks . 
So it might be a good idea for them to look to Asia to help them get the job done , and to do it right , both in terms of strategy and funding . 
Ending the crisis requires not only easing liquidity , but also repairing banks &quot; balance sheets and rebuilding their capital base . 
While the times call for a systematic approach , the solutions offered have been disjointed or inadequate . 
Guarantees on interbank lending won &apos;t reduce bad loans ; purchasing bad loans won &apos;t improve banks &quot; ability to lend ; and taking minority stakes in banks with marquee names ignores smaller ones that are just as likely to be badly exposed to sub-prime debt and thus unable to serve the local businesses and consumers that oil the economy . 
One of the astounding things about the ongoing efforts to resolve the crisis has been the lack of a clear initiative to inspect banks &quot; balance sheets thoroughly . 
Regulators need to know just how many banks are in trouble and approximate how bad their situations are in order to design and implement targeted solutions . 
The measures that Asian governments took to repair their financial sectors during the Asian crisis ten years ago could provide a template for the US and European bailouts . 
Asian governments borrowed heavily from the International Monetary Fund to bail out their crumbling financial systems . 
They assessed the health of major financial institutions , and then established asset management companies to acquire non-performing loans at a fraction of face value , as well as restructuring agencies to close insolvent banks , nationalize ailing ones , and recapitalize viable ones . 
Those that survived the cull were forced to consolidate and then were recapitalized . 
Weaker banks merged with stronger rivals , or combined to form new , stronger entities under state supervision . 
In some cases , banks were given a timetable for meeting capital-adequacy ratios . 
Eventually , the state agencies sold controlling stakes in the nationalized banks to foreign investors , and auctioned off the bad loans they had repackaged . 
Now substitute the IMF loan with the American and European rescue packages , the bad loans with sub-prime debt , and you have virtually parallel situations and transplantable measures with which to fix the US and European financial sectors . 
It is , of course , clear that the US and others in the G7 are wary of even temporary nationalization . 
By buying minority stakes in a handful of banks , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is acting like an investment banker who focuses on instant results , not like a regulator who takes aim at the root of the problem . 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown deserves the accolades he is now receiving . 
His actions toward HBOS and RBS show that his government is prepared to take control , not just equity . 
One option that Western regulators can pursue to boost their banks is to bring in Asian sovereign wealth funds ( SWFs ) and large financial institutions . 
Learning from their own hardships has helped some Asian countries become the cash-rich sovereigns they are today . 
China , which dealt with its own bad-loan problems in the first half of this decade , now has nearly $ 2 trillion in foreign reserves , almost three times the size of the US bailout budget . 
There is no reason why the US and Europe should not take advantage of the wealth of Asian institutions . 
In return , the Asian institutions would have a chance at the rich returns they desperately seek but cannot receive at home . 
SWFs are meant to diversify state investments to higher-risk , higher-return assets . 
China , Korea , Singapore , and Japan all have aging populations and massive pension obligations that need immediate funding . 
Likewise , many of their banks are overcapitalized with nowhere to go : after the Asian crisis and the Japanese asset bubble of the 1990 &quot; s , companies have become conservative borrowers , while banks &quot; opportunities to expand within the region remain limited by restrictions on foreign ownership of local banks . 
Unfortunately , some SWFs that invested in financial institutions in the earlier part of the year have seen their portfolios decline in value . 
It therefore behooves the US and Europe to reach out to Asian institutions to participate in mending their financial systems . 
A key to the success of Asia &apos;s restructuring effort , despite massive social , political , and economic obstacles , is the defined and systematic way in which each market dealt with its banks to reorganize the sector . 
This approach , so far , has been lacking in the West . 
As the crisis threatens the global economy , regulators do not have the luxury of taking their time .
