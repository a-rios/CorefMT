Iran - a Land of Paradoxes 
Iran is marking the 23 rd anniversary of its Islamic Revolution with nostalgic blasts at &quot; America , the Great Satan , &quot; thanks , in part , to President George Bush naming Iran as part of the &quot; Axis of Evil &quot; involved in terrorism and the production of weapons of mass destruction . 
Beneath the surface , however , Iran is no longer Ayatollah Khomeini &apos;s sharia state . 
Iran does deserve to be classified as a regional and , perhaps , a global promoter of instability ; its support for the fundamentalist Islamic terrorism of Hizbollah in Lebanon is , indeed , aimed at further undermining the diminishing chances for an Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation . 
But internal developments in Iran are complex , and demonization of the Islamic Republic is not helpful . 
Neither is a drawing a simple dichotomy between &quot; conservatives &quot; and &quot; reformers , &quot; the latter led by President Khattami , helpful . 
In many respects , Iran is perhaps the most interesting country in the region , with the greatest potential for development leading to - not to a Western-style democracy - but greater opening and liberalization . 
The paradox is that Iran &apos;s potential is embedded in its ideology as an Islamic state . 
After the first turbulent and murderous years of the Iranian revolution , the last few years have shown some remarkable developments . 
Among them : 
Elections : these are confined to an Islamic discourse , and all candidates and parties must secure the imprimatur of the highest Islamic authority in the land before they can be listed on a ballot . 
But despite these restrictions , there is a fierce contest between various groups and interpretations ; 
Women can vote and participate actively and publicly in political life . 
Moreover , the general image of Iranian women suppressed behind their black chadors is more complicated than it first seems . 
For example , in medicine : because male doctors are prevented by strict Islamic law from treating women , the government has encouraged the training of female doctors . 
Today , there are many more women doctors in Iran than under the Shah , and the number of women dying at childbirth is among the lowest in the region . 
The government has also instituted a very pro-active birth control program , and has found a way of legitimizing it within an Islamic context , saying &quot; we want educated Islamic families , not just large Islamic families . &quot; 
Iran , as a consequence , has one of the lowest birth rates in the region . 
Because elections to the Majlis ( Parliament ) and the Presidency are contested , they are meaningful . 
It is , for example , clear that President Khattami was elected with the support of women and younger people , and the &quot; establishment &quot; candidate was not elected . 
There is nothing like this in any Arab country : In Egypt or Syria ( just as in Belarus ) there is virtually only one candidate , and he receives between 97-98 % of the vote . 
Parliamentary debates are real , and real contested voting takes place . 
Again , this is nothing like the rubber-stamp sham parliaments of countries like Egypt and Syria . 
The shades of gray have real consequences for policy towards Iran : as an Iranian political scientist recently put it at a seminar in Germany , younger people in Iran do feel themselves to be Muslims , and Iran will never become a secular society . 
But they view their Islam as part of their Iranian identity , whereas the older clerics viewed Islam as a universal revolutionary identity . 
These younger people - the Iranian scholar claimed - are first of all Iranian nationalists , and would like to dissociate themselves from Middle Eastern politics , in particular the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
They will continue , of course , to give verbal support for the Palestinian course , but it is not at the top of their agenda . 
In sum , Iran presents a complex , sometimes confusing picture . 
But anyone who knows European history can identify a parallel : the Calvinist , Puritan revolution . 
The Calvinists of Geneva , or Cromwell &apos;s Puritans , were - like the mullahs of Teheran - biblio-centric , with a Holy Book as their model for the ideal society . 
Their society was meant to be puritanical , frugal , non-permissive , with laws against conspicuous consumption and luxuries . 
It was also anti-feminist , anchored in patriarchal family structures . 
Because the Calvinists did not accept a Church hierarchy , they - like the Iranian Shi &apos;ites who are not part of the Sunni majoritarian universalism - based their legitimacy on the community of believers and so introduced elections . 
But once you hold real elections , different modes of interpretation of the Holy Book become possible and legitimate . 
Suddenly , there exists a mechanism for participation , control , dissent ( limited as it may be ) and the introduction of innovative strategies that seek to legitimize change within a traditional context . 
In Europe , after all , Calvin &apos;s Geneva - an autocratic theocracy , more similar to Khomeini &apos;s Teheran than to any other regime - eventually developed , through English Puritanism , towards modern parliamentary government . 
Indeed , in Britain until the l820 &apos;s only members of the Church of England could vote in Parliament or be elected to it . 
Will Shi &apos;ite Iran follow a road similar to that of the European Calvinists ? 
Nothing is pre-determined ; but the parallel is striking . 
For all of today &apos;s involvement of some Iranian leaders in terrorism , the picture is more complex , more interesting - and perhaps more promising than President Bush &apos;s speech suggests .
