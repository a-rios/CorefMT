Financial History &apos;s False Lessons 
TOULOUSE - If history punishes those who fail to learn from it , financial history does its punishing with a sadistic twist - it also punishes those who learn from it too enthusiastically . 
Time and again , financial crises have reflected the weaknesses of regulatory systems founded on the lessons learned from previous crises . 
Today &apos;s crisis is no exception ; nor will the next one be . 
The post-war system of financial regulation was founded on three supposed lessons from the 1930 &quot; s . 
First , we thought that the main reason why banks fail is that depositors panic , not that the main reason depositors panic is that banks are in danger of failing . 
Like the view that running away from lions provokes them to eat you , there is a grain of truth in the view that banks fail because depositors panic . 
In fact , many panics happen for a good reason . 
Even in the 1930 &quot; s , most banks failed as a result of bad management and illegal activity , as is true today . 
Second , we thought that the depositors prone to panic would always be small depositors - households and small firms - rather than corporations or professional investors . 
We now know that this is wrong , but there was never any serious reason to believe it . 
If large corporations ( and other banks ) have deposits that they expect to be able to claim on short notice , and if they know that not all such deposits can be withdrawn at the same time , then suspicion that a bank might fail gives them as much reason to rush to the exit as households have . 
If bank failures typically reflect real underlying problems , sensitive professional investors can be expected to react quickly when any whiff of panic is in the air . 
Lending between banks , as well as deposits placed by large corporations , increased spectacularly in the years leading up to the crisis . 
Until the financial reforms adopted since the crisis , this &quot; shadow &quot; banking system operated outside the regulatory regime that applied to traditional deposit-taking banks . 
Indeed , shadow banking would not have grown so fast had that regime not been devised with the apparent lessons of the 1930 &quot; s in mind . 
In this case , unlike in the 1930 &quot; s , banks stopped trusting each other before the rest of us realized that it was time to stop trusting banks . 
The third false lesson is that if we could only maintain confidence in the financial system ( and by extension the wider economic system ) , the system itself could be trusted to survive and prosper . 
The dot-com bubble wasn &apos;t a threat to the banking system as such , but rather a threat to aggregate demand . 
The idea that something that was good for confidence might lead to danger for the banking system was too strange to be believable . 
The lesson that confidence-building measures averted a crash in 2000 was precisely the lesson that the financial system did not need to learn . 
Why were we all taken in by the idea that we could make ourselves collectively richer by selling each other overpriced equities and houses ? 
We were collectively irrational , but that is no explanation . 
We need to know why some forms of collective irrationality gain a stronger grip on us than others . 
An intriguing clue comes from research in neuroscience that explains why it is impossible to tickle yourself . 
Tickling appears to be caused by unexpected sensations on certain areas of the skin . 
Because the brain of a person trying to tickle herself anticipates the sensations that will be caused by her fingers - a process performed within the cerebellum - the sensation no longer tickles . 
You can , however , succeed in tickling yourself through an intermediary - a machine , for instance , that translates the movements of your fingers into sensations on the skin by a method indirect enough for the cerebellum to be unable to anticipate them . 
Although the conscious part of your brain knows that the tickling sensation comes from you and isn &apos;t &quot; really &quot; unexpected , the cerebellum doesn &apos;t get it , and the tickling works . 
Tickling yourself is as futile as trying to make yourself richer by writing yourself a check - or selling yourself your house for twice its current market price . 
It isn &apos;t much better if you and a friend write each other checks , or sell each other houses . 
For a few years we managed to circumvent that part of our brains that told us we couldn &apos;t tickle ourselves to greater wealth . 
Perhaps ordinary citizens always knew that when they sold houses for real gains , ultimately they were profiting at someone else &apos;s expense . 
It was only economists , who studied the lessons of previous crises , who fell for the idea that no one would lose out . 
Today &apos;s policymakers , reasoning from the 1930 &quot; s , appear to believe that creating confidence is somehow different from creating good reasons to be confident . 
The recent &quot; stress tests &quot; of European banks were blatantly designed as a confidence-building measure rather than a genuine exploration of possible systemic weaknesses - failing , for instance , to include the possibility of default on Greek sovereign debt . 
That , of course , is like testing your home &apos;s fire extinguishers against burglars . 
Positive results will persuade only those who have learned well the lessons of the 1930 &quot; s - and then failed to forget them .
