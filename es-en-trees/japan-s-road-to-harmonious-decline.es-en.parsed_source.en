Japan &apos;s Road to Harmonious Decline 
PARIS - Forget what you have heard about the hard-working Japanese salaryman : since the early 1990 &quot; s , the Japanese have drastically slackened their work habits . 
Indeed , Tokyo University economist Fumio Hayashi has demonstrated that the main reason behind Japan &apos;s 20 years of stagnation has been the decrease in the quantity of work performed by the Japanese . 
The government itself has led the way here , starting with its decision to close public administration buildings on Saturdays . 
Japan &apos;s banks followed suit . 
From 1988 to 1993 , the legal work week fell 10 % , from 44 hours to 40 . 
In the service sector , the decline is even worse than in manufacturing , because services are heavily regulated and partially closed to foreign competition . 
In the retail sector , which employs a huge number of Japan &apos;s unskilled workers - the so-called &quot; mom and pop &quot; shops - Japanese productivity is now 25 % lower than in Western Europe . 
Former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi ( in power between 2000 and 2004 ) and his chief economic adviser and minister of finance , Heizo Takenaka , understood all too well that Japan was losing ground in terms of productivity . 
They sought to counter the trend toward less work through privatization and deregulation . 
Japan &apos;s powerful bureaucrats , nostalgic for the 1960 &quot; s model of development , whereby government and its business cronies nurtured the Japanese miracle , strongly opposed this bold , free-market solution . 
Moreover , public opinion never supported Koizumi &apos;s policy , which was alleged then , as it is now , to be a source of inequality . 
Nonetheless , the newly victorious Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) has been able to make the accusation stick to free-market policies . 
The recent electoral triumph of Yukio Hatoyama &apos;s untested DPJ thus confirmed the popular wish not to follow America &apos;s free-market model . 
Hatoyama makes no economic sense in declaring that growth is important but that happiness comes first . 
Nevertheless , this sentiment does reflect the mood of many Japanese . 
Assuming that Hayashi and Takenaka are right about the causes of Japan &apos;s stagnation , one must ask whether today &apos;s Japanese are willing to work more in order to catch up with the United States and to lead Asia development ? 
Stagnation is a tacit collective choice made by a country &apos;s majority . 
Have the Japanese people opted for it ? 
Nearly half of the Japanese population is either retired or near retirement age , and they worked very hard to achieve a high level of comfort . 
Thanks to them , despite the blighted economy of the &quot; lost decade , &quot; Japanese income is still higher than it is in Europe . 
Moreover , unemployment is low compared to the Western world , because the unproductive distribution sector absorbs young people who cannot find better jobs . 
Stagnating Japan has thus remained a peaceful and rather conservative society . 
By contrast , a higher growth rate would require fewer golf breaks for salarymen and significant immigration in a nation that is unaccustomed to foreign intrusion and different cultural habits . 
Are the Japanese really ready to accept such a cure ? 
Most Japanese , mostly among the old generation , are satisfied with the kind of society they have built . 
They perceive Americans and Europeans as being obsessed with money and material ambition , and they seem ready to accept some stagnation as the price of remaining truly Japanese . 
Hatoyama understands this , which is why he won the recent election . 
Hatoyama &apos;s talk about a &quot; new age , &quot; which sounds strange from a Western perspective , is in harmony with the Japanese way : this is a country where thousands of cult leaders offer myriad paths to Happiness , in particular a glib mishmash of New Age and Zen Buddhism . 
How long can Japan sustain this period of harmonious stagnation ? 
Japan &apos;s high-tech industries remain competitive , and the country is still the world &apos;s second largest exporter . 
It retains a highly innovative economy , which registers more new patents each year than all European countries combined - second only to the US and eons ahead of China and India . 
Japan &apos;s 150 million people still produce far more than 2.5 billion Chinese and Indians . 
In ten years or so , however , Japan could lose its status vis-Ã -vis the rest of Asia . 
Stagnation is already having a big impact on Japan &apos;s young , for whom it is becoming hard to find a job , let alone life-long employment in a leading global company . 
Teenagers know that they will have fewer opportunities than their parents had . 
How they will pay for their parent &apos;s pensions and health care is unknown . 
Most troubling is the absence of open debate about these matters . 
Japan is a hush-hush society , where everyone is supposed to guess what is going on , and the media are careful not to provoke social division . 
Hard questions are not to be asked , and straightforward answers are considered too rude and crude to be given . 
Foreigners are welcome to make comments , but their advice will usually be ignored . 
It may seem to most Japanese that their continuing economic power affords them the luxury of indulging such ingrained habits . 
Perhaps they should bear in mind Ernest Hemingway &apos;s description of how a man goes broke : &quot; slowly , then all at once . &quot;
