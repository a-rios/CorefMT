Voodoo Economics Revisited 
WASHINGTON , DC - Democratic and Republican leaders in Washington are suddenly falling over themselves to agree on the need for major tax cuts - affecting not just middle-class Americans , but also very rich people ( both living and when they die ) . 
Does this sudden outbreak of the long-desired bipartisan consensus indicate that a new , stronger America is just around the corner ? 
Unfortunately , the opposite is true . 
What we are seeing is agreement across the aisle on a very dangerous approach to public finance : a continuation and extension of what President George H.W. Bush memorably called &quot; voodoo economics . &quot; 
Its consequences are about to catch up with America , and the world . 
Bush was competing with Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination in 1980 . 
Reagan suggested that tax cuts would pay for themselves , i.e. , actually raise revenue - a notion that became known as &quot; supply side &quot; economics . 
There &apos;s nothing wrong with worrying about the disincentive effect of higher taxes , but the extreme version put forward by Reagan did not really apply to the United States . 
When you cut taxes , you get lower revenue , which means a bigger budget deficit . 
To be sure , no serious people are claiming the full Reagan effect today - partly because the Congressional Budget Office has kept everyone honest by showing in detail that the tax cuts will increase the deficit by close to $ 900 billion . 
But there is a broader Reagan-type reasoning at work here : unemployment is high , the economy is not growing fast enough , and we &quot; need a fiscal stimulus . &quot; 
For those who generally like lower taxes , of course , this , too , is wishful thinking . 
Experience with fiscal policy over the past few decades is clear . 
It is worth stimulating the economy with discretionary fiscal policy only occasionally - specifically , when not doing so would be calamitous . 
Thus , it made sense to pursue a fiscal stimulus of some kind in early 2009 . 
More generally , fiscal stimulus is unlikely to have much lasting effect , as is the case now . 
There may be some temporary positive impact on demand , or higher interest rates could offset the entire fiscal push - rates on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond are up significantly from a month ago ( from 3.21 % to 4.16 % ) , when the discussion of tax cuts began in earnest . 
The market is nervous - mostly about the prospect of large fiscal deficits as far as the eye can see . 
Some commentators dismiss this as irrational , but , again , that is wishful thinking . 
The path-breaking work over many years of Carmen Reinhart , my colleague at the Peterson Institute in Washington , makes this very clear - no country , including the US , escapes the deleterious consequences of persistent large fiscal deficits . 
( Indeed , her book with Ken Rogoff , This Time Is Different , should be required reading for US policymakers . ) 
In this environment , a further fiscal stimulus may prove counterproductive , with the extra spending counterbalanced by the negative effect on the housing market of higher interest rates . 
The US Federal Reserve promised to hold down longer-term rates , but its commitments in that direction now seem ineffective . 
But that is not the real danger here . 
Most American politicians like to think and talk only about the US . 
But longer-term US interest rates are very much affected by what happens in the rest of the world - and how private-sector investors view US government debt relative to other countries &quot; sovereign debt . 
The eurozone &apos;s problems certainly help the US sell more debt at lower prices - for now . 
But the chances are high that the eurozone will sort out its difficulties in a year or so ( most likely after another round or two of crisis ) , in part through the judicious use of fiscal austerity . 
It would make complete sense if a German-led core emerged stronger and more politically integrated than before - within a eurozone that has a different composition , a different structure , and very different rules . 
This presumably more fiscally unified political entity would be highly attractive to investors . 
A year from now , what kind of economy will the US have ? 
Any short-term &quot; fiscal stimulus &quot; effect will have worn off , unemployment will still be high , and there will no doubt be politicians clamoring for more tax cuts . 
The budget deficit will likely be in the range of 8-10 % of GDP , even if growth comes back to some extent . 
And the bond markets will be much more nervous , meaning higher interest payments , which will widen the deficit further . 
We might also be looking at a potential ratings downgrade for US government debt - implying the prospect of even higher interest rates . 
Some people expected Paul Ryan , a rising star within the Republican Party who will become Chairman of the House budget committee in the next Congress , to provide a fiscally responsible anchor to the next round of the deficit debate in the US . 
Writing in The Financial Times in early November , Ryan suggested , &quot; America is eager for an adult conversation on the threat of debt . &quot; 
But all indications are that he is just as childishly reckless on fiscal policy as most of his Republican colleagues since Ronald Reagan . 
Unfortunately , there is no sign yet that the Democratic leadership is ready for a mature conversation about fiscal consolidation , either . 
Both parties &quot; leaders will get there - but only when dragged , kicking and screaming , by the financial markets .
