Afghanistan &apos;s Customary Anguish 
FARAH , AFGHANISTAN - When the problems riddling Afghan society are listed - violence , insecurity , corruption , religious fundamentalism - one dominating factor is usually left out : the influence of customary law . 
In Afghanistan , there are three principal legal references : constitutional law , the Koran , and the system of customary law known as Farhang , the most dominant and strictest version of which is called Pashtunwali ( the way of the Pashtuns ) . 
Originally an ancient honor code , Farhang ensures the dominance of the oldest male of any household , followed by married sons , unmarried sons , and grandsons , then wives ( with the youngest at the bottom ) . 
Collective decisions are taken by patriarchs in councils called jirgas , where all have to be in agreement . 
This agreement includes including collaborating or not with the Taliban , cooperating with the Coalition forces , accepting or refusing poppy eradication in a village . 
Everything else is left to patriarchal discretion . Here , no one will intervene except to reinforce the application of the patriarch &apos;s rights - say , in stoning a supposedly wayward girl , or turning a blind eye to so-called &quot; honor killings &quot; of women . 
Every act of an Afghan male &apos;s life is integrated in a form of reciprocity , in which nothing is free . 
Melmastia , the basic tenet of hospitality means &quot; I will give you shelter if you ask me to , even if you are a fugitive murderer ; but , in exchange , you fight my battles . &quot; 
This sense of customary obligation is why so many of President Hamid Karzai &apos;s cronies remain in place and Taliban leaders remain safe . 
Women are excluded from collective decision-making , as they are mere objects . 
Girls are literally sold upon marriage ( the father is paid money for his daughter &apos;s labor and reproductive capacity ) and join their husband &apos;s household . 
The younger the girl , the higher the price . 
Marriage , especially in the provinces , is routinely consummated on pre-pubescent bodies . 
Yet women are precious in their own way . 
A family &apos;s principal &quot; cultural capital &quot; is its honor , which is ensured by denying women any opportunity to highlight male failings and therefore tarnish clan respectability . 
As a result , women must be strictly secluded and made invisible when in public , for they are personally responsible for the desire that they could ignite in schools , hospitals , parks , or markets . 
The all-covering burqa ensures sufficient anonymity to permit women a certain amount of freedom in public space . 
Every female simultaneously carries her father &apos;s and her husband &apos;s honor , and will stoically submit to all forms of violence committed in its name . 
This may mean dying in childbirth rather than risking the &quot; dishonor &quot; of giving birth in a public place , a hospital , in front of strangers . 
Going to court is practically unheard of , as it would mean renouncing family practices . 
From the male point of view , resorting to outside police or judicial intervention would signify an inability to fight one &apos;s own battles - an admission of defeat and a symbolic castration . 
This helps explain the intense corruption present in Afghan courts , where &quot; honor &quot; can be redeemed by bribing a judge to have a rapist or murderer released . 
As violence is strictly a private matter , relinquishing justice to state institutions could be an unacceptable humiliation . 
Customary law is not rigid in that it is made to fit round the demands of global economy . 
It has become more rigorous in it s applications due to the influence of 
For example , while the Koran allows for a measure of female inheritance , tribal custom does not authorize it , which explains the popularity of tribal councils to resolve inheritance problems and cheat women out of their rights . 
Similarly , whereas the Koran requires four eyewitnesses as proof of adultery , mere suspicion of some unregulated , potentially sexual conduct by a woman warrants stoning under customary law . 
Yet an awareness of alternatives is seeping in through the media , even in remote provinces . 
Iranian films and the much loved Indian TV serials , not to mention the occasional American film , influence peoples &apos; expectations . 
Add to that the experience of having lived abroad as refugees in Pakistan and Iran . 
Girls know that there are options to an unacceptable way of life : women are increasingly demanding more from life than what custom ordains . 
This is especially true for those who have lived in Iran , a totally Muslim environment that allows women the freedom to study and work as well as access to adequate healthcare and family planning . 
Once back in rural Afghanistan , forced into brutal marriages , many desperate women - especially returnees from Iran - resort to self-immolation . 
Violence and murder of women are on the increase , perpetrated by men who feel that these alternatives pose a threat to their authority . 
The West imagines that religion is the central issue in Afghanistan . 
But the heart of the matter is the preservation of ancient patriarchal rights that go back to Biblical times , reformatted to fit the demands of globalized capitalism . 
Governments and international aid organizations have failed to take into consideration the role of
