Islam \ u0027s Clash with Modernization 
Ten years ago , Samuel Huntington argued that the fault lines of world politics in the post-Cold War era are mainly cultural - a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; defined by five or six major cultural zones that can sometimes co-exist but will never converge , because they lack shared values . 
One implication of this argument is that the September 11 th terrorist attacks , and the US-led response , should be viewed as part of a larger civilizational struggle between Islam and the West . 
Another is that what we in the West regard as universal human rights are simply an outgrowth of European culture , inapplicable to those who do not share this particular tradition . 
I believe that Huntington is wrong on both counts . 
Sir V. S. Naipaul , recently awarded the Nobel Prize for literature , once wrote an article entitled &quot; Our Universal Civilization . &quot; 
How appropriate . 
Naipaul is , after all , an author of Indian descent who grew up in Trinidad . 
He argued not only that Western values are applicable across cultures , but that he owes his literary achievements to precisely that universality afforded by crossing Huntington &apos;s putative civilizational boundaries . 
Universality is possible in broader terms as well , because the primary force in human history and world politics is not cultural plurality , but the general progress of modernization , whose institutional expressions are liberal democracy and market-oriented economics . 
The current conflict is not part of a clash of civilizations in the sense that we are dealing with cultural zones of equal standing ; rather , it is symptomatic of a rearguard action by those who are threatened by modernization , and thus by its moral component , respect for human rights . 
Virtually any right that is or has been asserted historically relies on one of three authorities : God , man , or nature . 
The original source of rights , God or religion , has been rejected in the West since the beginning of the Enlightenment . 
John Locke &apos;s &quot; Second Discourse on Government &quot; begins with a long polemic against Robert Filmer &apos;s argument for the divine right of kings . 
In other words , the secularism of the Western conception of rights lies at the root of the liberal tradition . 
Today , this seems to be the major dividing line between Islam and the West , because many Muslims reject the secular state . 
But before we endorse the idea of an irreducible clash of civilizations , we should consider why modern secular liberalism arose in the West in the first place . 
It is no accident that liberal ideas emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries , when bloody sectarian struggles between Christian sects throughout Europe exposed the impossibility of a religious consensus on which to base political rule . 
Hobbes , Locke , and Montesquieu reacted to such horrors as the Thirty-Year War by arguing that religion and politics must be separated in the interest , first and foremost , of ensuring civil peace . 
Islam now confronts a similar dilemma . 
Efforts to unite politics and religion are dividing Muslims just as they divided Christians in Europe . 
Our politicians are right ( and not merely expedient ) to insist that the current conflict is not with Islam - an extremely heterogeneous faith that recognizes no authoritative source of doctrinal interpretation . 
Intolerance and fundamentalism form one choice for Muslims , but Islam has always had to contend with the question of secularism and the need for religious tolerance , as is evident from the ongoing reformist ferment in theocratic Iran . 
The second source of rights - the essentially positivist view that whatever a society declares by some constitutional means to be a right becomes one - likewise provides no guarantee for liberalizing tendencies , for it leads to cultural relativism . 
If , as Huntington implies , the rights that we claim in the West emerged uniquely from the political crisis of European Christianity after the Protestant Reformation , what is to stop other societies from appealing to their own local traditions to deny these rights ? 
The Chinese government is very adept at wielding this question . 
The final source of rights is nature . 
In fact , the language of natural rights - advanced most emphatically in 18 th century America - continues to shape our moral discourse . 
When we say , for example , that race , ethnicity , wealth , and gender are all non-essential characteristics , this obviously implies that we believe that there is a substrate of &quot; humanness &quot; which entitles us to equal protection against certain types of behavior by other groups or states . 
This belief is the ultimate reason to reject cultural arguments that would subordinate some - women , for example - within a society . 
Moreover , the spread of democratic institutions in non-European contexts during the last decades of the 20 th century suggests that we in the West are not alone in this belief . 
But if human rights are indeed universal , should we demand their implementation everywhere and at all times ? 
Aristotle argues in his Nicomachean Ethics that natural rules of justice exist , but that their application demands flexibility and prudence . 
That insight remains valid today . 
We must distinguish between a theoretical belief in the universality of human rights and the actual practice of supporting human rights around the world , for our shared &quot; humanness &quot; is shaped in varying social environments , such that our perception of rights differs . 
In many traditional societies , where life choices and opportunities are limited , the Western , individualistic view of rights is very jarring . 
This is because the Western conception cannot be abstracted from the larger process of modernization . 
To argue otherwise is to put the cart before the horse . 
For our commitment to the universality of human rights forms but one part of the complex context of a universal civilization , from which an understanding of the other elements of modern societies - economic justice and political democracy - cannot be excluded .
