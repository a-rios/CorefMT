Why America Isn &apos;t Working 
CAMBRIDGE - As the US economy limps toward the second anniversary of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy , anemic growth has left unemployment mired near 10 % , with little prospect of significant improvement anytime soon . 
Little wonder that , with mid-term congressional elections coming in November , Americans are angrily asking why the government &apos;s hyper-aggressive stimulus policies have not turned things around . 
What more , if anything , can be done ? 
The honest answer - but one that few voters want to hear - is that there is no magic bullet . 
It took more than a decade to dig today &apos;s hole , and climbing out of it will take a while , too . 
As Carmen Reinhart and I warned in our 2009 book on the 800-year history of financial crises ( with the ironic title &quot; This Time is Different &quot; ) , slow , protracted recovery with sustained high unemployment is the norm in the aftermath of a deep financial crisis . 
Why is it so tough to boost employment rapidly after a financial crisis ? 
One reason , of course , is that the financial system takes time to heal - and thus for credit to begin flowing properly again . 
Pumping vast taxpayer funds into financial behemoths does not solve the deeper problem of deflating an overleveraged society . 
Americans borrowed and shopped until they were blue in the face , thinking that an ever-rising housing price market would wash away all financial sins . 
The rest of the world poured money into the US , making it seem as if life was one big free lunch . 
Even now , many Americans believe that the simple solution to the nation &apos;s problem is just to cut taxes and goose up private consumption . 
Cutting taxes is certainly not bad in principle , especially for supporting long-term investment and growth . 
But there are several problems with the gospel of lower taxes . 
First , total public-sector debt ( including state and local debt ) is already nearing the 119 % -of-GDP peak reached after World War II . 
Some argue passionately that now is no time to worry about future debt problems , but , in my view , any realistic assessment of the medium-term risks does not permit us simply to dismiss such concerns . 
A second problem with tax cuts is that they might well have only a limited impact on demand in the short run , with the private sector hoarding a significant share of the funds to repair badly over-leveraged balance sheets . 
Last but not least , there is a fairness issue . 
By some measures , nearly half of all Americans do not pay any income tax already , so cutting taxes skews an already very unequal income distribution . 
Deferred maintenance on income equality is one of many imbalances that built up in the US economy during the pre-crisis boom . 
If allowed to fester , the political consequences could be severe , including trade protectionism and perhaps even social unrest . 
Those who think that the government should take up the slack in private spending point out that there is an abundance of growth-enhancing projects - a point that should be obvious to anyone familiar with America &apos;s fraying infrastructure . 
Likewise , transfers to state and local governments , which have limited constitutional scope to borrow , would help slow down wrenching layoffs of teachers , firefighters , and police . 
Lastly , extending unemployment insurance in the wake of a once-in-a-half-century crisis should be a no-brainer . 
But , unfortunately , Keynesian demand management is no panacea , either . 
While tax cuts enhance long-term productivity , expanding the government sector is hardly a recipe for economic vitality . 
There are surely many useful activities for the government to undertake in a market economy , but a frenzied orgy of stimulus spending is not conducive to rational discussion of what they should be . 
And of course , there again is the matter of the soaring national debt . 
All in all , the G-20 &quot; s policy of aiming for gradual stabilization of growth in government debt , bringing it into line with national-income growth by 2016 , seems a reasonable approach to balancing short-term stimulus against longer-term financial risks , even at the cost of lingering unemployment . 
While America is facing the limits of fiscal policy , monetary policy can do more , as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke detailed in a recent speech in Jackson Hole , Wyoming . 
With credit markets impaired , the Fed could buy more government bonds or private-sector debt . 
Bernanke also noted the possibility of temporarily raising the Fed &apos;s medium-term inflation target ( a policy that I suggested in this column in December 2008 ) . 
Given the massive deleveraging of public- and private-sector debt that lies ahead , and my continuing cynicism about the US political and legal system &apos;s capacity to facilitate workouts , two or three years of slightly elevated inflation strikes me as the best of many very bad options , and far preferable to deflation . 
While the Fed is still reluctant to compromise its long-term independence , I suspect that before this is over it will use most , if not all , of the tools outlined by Bernanke . 
The bottom line is that Americans will have to be patient for many years as the financial sector regains its health and the economy climbs slowly out of its hole . 
The government can certainly help , but beware of pied pipers touting quick fixes .
