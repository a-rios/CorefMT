The Soccer Mafia 
NEW YORK - The only surprise about the arrest of seven FIFA officials in a Swiss hotel in the early morning of May 27 is that it happened at all . 
Most people assumed that these pampered men in expensive suits , governing the world &apos;s soccer federation , were beyond the reach of the law . 
Whatever rumors flew or reports were made on bribes , kickbacks , vote-rigging , and other dodgy practices , FIFA President Joseph &quot; Sepp &quot; Blatter and his colleagues and associates always seemed to emerge without a scratch . 
So far , 14 men , including nine current or former FIFA executives ( but not Blatter ) , have been charged with a range of fraud and corruption offenses in the United States , where prosecutors accuse them , among other things , of pocketing $ 150 million in bribes and kickbacks . 
There is , of course , a long tradition of racketeering in professional sports . 
American mobsters have had a major interest in boxing , for example . 
Even the once gentlemanly game of cricket has been tainted by the infiltration of gambling networks and other crooked dealers . 
FIFA is just the richest , most powerful , most global milk cow of all . 
Some have likened FIFA to the Mafia , and Blatter , born in a small Swiss village , has been called &quot; Don Blatterone . &quot; 
This is not entirely fair . 
So far as we know , no murder contracts have ever been issued from FIFA &apos;s head office in Zürich . 
One could , of course , choose to see FIFA as a dysfunctional organization , rather than a criminal enterprise . 
The entire operation is run by a close-knit group of men ( women play no part in this murky business ) , all of whom are beholden to the boss . 
This did not start under Blatter . 
It was his predecessor , the sinister Brazilian João Havelange , who turned FIFA into a corrupt and vastly rich empire by incorporating more and more developing countries , whose votes for the bosses were bought with all manner of lucrative marketing and media deals . 
Huge amounts of corporate money from Coca-Cola and Adidas went sloshing through the system , all the way to the roomy pockets of Third World potentates and , allegedly , of Havelange himself . 
Coke was the main sponsor of the 1978 World Cup in Argentina , ruled in those days by a brutal military junta . 
Blatter is not quite as uncouth as Havelange . 
Unlike the Brazilian , he does not openly associate with mobsters . 
In the case of Qatar , this meant the right to stage the World Cup in an utterly unsuitable climate , in stadiums hastily built under terrible conditions by underpaid foreign workers with few rights . 
Complaints from slightly more fastidious Europeans are often met with accusations of neo-colonialist attitudes or even racism . 
Indeed , this is what makes Blatter a typical man of our times . 
He is a ruthless operator who presents himself as the champion of the developing world , protecting the interests of Africans , Asians , Arabs , and South Americans against the arrogant West . 
Things have changed since the days when venal men from poor countries were paid off to further Western political or commercial interests . 
This still occurs , of course . 
Western businessmen , architects , artists , university presidents , and museum directors - or anyone who needs large amounts of cash to fund their expensive projects - now have to deal with non-Western autocrats . 
Pandering to authoritarian regimes and opaque business interests is not a wholesome enterprise . 
The contemporary alliance of Western interests - in the arts and higher education no less than in sports - with rich , undemocratic powers involves compromises that might easily damage established reputations . 
One way to deflect the attention is to borrow the old anti-imperialist rhetoric of the left . 
Dealing with despots and shady tycoons is no longer venal , but noble . 
Selling the franchise of a university or a museum to a Gulf state , building yet another enormous stadium in China , or making a fortune out of soccer favors to Russia or Qatar is progressive , anti-racist , and a triumph of global fraternity and universal values . 
This is the most irritating aspect of Blatter &apos;s FIFA . 
The corruption , the vote-buying , the absurd thirst of soccer bosses for international prestige , the puffed-out chests festooned with medals and decorations - all of that is par for the course . 
It is the hypocrisy that rankles . 
To lament the shift in global power and influence away from the heartlands of Europe and the US is useless .
