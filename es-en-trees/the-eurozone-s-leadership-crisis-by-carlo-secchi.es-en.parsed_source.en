More Leadership for More Europe 
MILAN - The debate about improving economic governance within the eurozone is shedding new light on the system &apos;s weaknesses . 
It was already evident when the Maastricht 
Then , for the common currency &apos;s first decade , that fundamental flaw was papered over . 
Now the eurozone - with a centralized monetary policy , run by the European Central Bank , alongside 27 national fiscal policies - has come to look like a mockery of economic common sense . 
Early on , important states like France and Germany stopped taking seriously the European Union &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact ( SGP ) , which was supposed to guarantee fiscal discipline and coordination among the member states . 
With the euro &apos;s introduction boosting intra-European trade and lowering inflation in many member states , fiscal obligations were simply ignored . 
The euro quickly became the world &apos;s second most important currency , and it proved to be a shield against external financial turbulence . 
Optimism soared and prudence fled - reflected in premature eurozone membership for countries like Greece , as well as in the gap between the pace of EU enlargement and that of institutional integration . 
In other words , Europe &apos;s decision-makers ultimately overlooked the basic requirements of a monetary union in a heterogeneous economic area : 
A sizeable common budget for the provision of public goods .

Satisfying these conditions would , of course , lead to fully-fledged political union , but the process could be gradual , starting with a banking union , a fiscal union , or a central bank with lender-of-last-resort status - a functionalist approach that might be more politically viable . 
Some will oppose greater solidarity nonetheless , disregarding the elementary fact that enhanced interdependence in a monetary union requires it , and ignoring the Lisbon Treaty &apos;s affirmation of Europe &apos;s &quot; social market &quot; model . 
A monetary union that does not benefit all of its participants will not survive for long . 
After the eurozone &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis erupted , defaults were avoided by establishing the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism ( since replaced by the European Stability Mechanism ) , and by crafting a more pragmatic and reinforced role for the ECB ( acting with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund ) . 
And a new &quot; fiscal compact &quot; foresees enshrining member states &quot; commitment to budget balance - and to reducing public debt to within 60 % of GDP in 20 years - in their constitutions . 
But any assessment of European economic governance must acknowledge the slow , contradictory nature of intergovernmental decision-making , in which a misconceived notion of national interest , together with upsurges in popular anti-EU sentiment and electoral pressure , has led to a stop-and-go process , punctuated by financial-market swoons . 
Viewed in these terms , the European political class has clearly failed to exercise leadership . 
The challenge now is twofold : how to cope with the financial crisis while creating a safer economic future through better governance . 
Excessive emphasis on fiscal rigor , unaccompanied by measures to stimulate growth , has reinforced recessionary trends , placing additional strain on national budgets and debt / GDP ratios . 
That drives up affected governments &quot; borrowing costs further , fueling a downward spiral . 
Any lasting solution requires Europeans to acknowledge that they now face a common problem that can be resolved only by greater cohesion and financial solidarity . 
The ECB must become a genuine central bank for Europe . 
The European banking system must be turned into a banking union with the ECB responsible for prudential supervision . 
The fiscal compact must be implemented quickly , and progress on harmonizing fiscal policies should continue . 
But fiscal discipline must be accompanied by policies that promote growth , without which balanced budgets and debt reduction cannot be achieved . 
The Europe 2020 strategy , approved two years ago in part to improve economic governance , is a good starting point , offering the basis for the &quot; growth compact &quot; that some EU governments have sought . 
The path to improved European economic governance leads through the EU &apos;s political institutions , with &quot; more Europe &quot; presupposing further strengthening of the European Parliament and the European Commission , and the abolition of veto powers in the European Council . 
The argument that strengthening Europe &apos;s common institutions would reduce national sovereignty appears very weak , for the simple reason that in today &apos;s globalized economy sovereignty is more apparent than real . 
Parallel with these changes , European leaders must publicly acknowledge that if the euro collapses , Europe will quickly revert to competitive devaluations , intra-EU protection , and &quot; beggar-thy-neighbor &quot; policies , all of which were evident in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s . 
European public opinion must be made aware that increasing interdependence means that the exchange-rate stability and gradual completion of the single market implied by the euro really do benefit all participants . 
Europe &apos;s political class needs to find the courage to take the next steps toward a closer union . 
The small price that nation-states will have to pay is negligible compared to the likely consequences of inaction .
