Putin &apos;s Dilemma 
PARIS - Many critics argue that the sanctions imposed on Russia for its actions in Ukraine are ineffective , because they are too limited in scale and scope . 
Moreover , sanctions are seen as allowing President Vladimir Putin to blame the West for Russia &apos;s internal problems . 
Indeed , some of Putin &apos;s supporters within Russia welcome the sanctions as a means to compel Russian autarky - and thus strategic independence from the West . 
These arguments are wrong . 
Though the sanctions are not backed by China , they are already having a powerful effect , and the expectation that they will be tightened further is a huge concern for investors and the Russian government . 
Full autarky , meanwhile , would imply a dramatic decline in Russian living standards - the foundation of Putin &apos;s domestic support . 
The latest sanctions are unprecedented . 
The European Union went even further than the United States . 
Exposure to Russian markets varies widely among EU countries - and between the EU and the US . 
But , after the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 , Russia can no longer pursue a divide-and-rule strategy that leverages these differences . 
Both the EU and the US have now sanctioned Russia &apos;s highest officials and leading companies and banks . 
The EU list includes all of the main state-owned banks ( the country &apos;s largest ) . 
Most important , the EU added Sberbank , a cornerstone of Russia &apos;s financial system , with assets totaling almost 30 % of Russian GDP and about half of Russian retail deposits . 
Currently , the sanctions only limit Sberbank &apos;s access to European capital markets . 
In the immediate future , Sberbank - and other sanctioned banks - will be able to replace European funds with liquidity provided by the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) or Asian sources . 
But the fact that Sberbank is on the list has created enormous anxiety for all foreign investors in Russia . 
They are right to be worried ; 
Russia &apos;s financial system is highly vulnerable . 
The banking sector &apos;s total external debt is $ 214 billion , of which $ 107 billion is due within a year ( and $ 129 billion within two years ) . 
Non-financial firms &quot; external debt totals $ 432 billion , with $ 128 billion due within a year ( and $ 175 billion within two years ) . 
These are large numbers even for Russia , with its currency reserves of $ 480 billion . 
Likewise , though the ban on exports to Russia of technology for the oil and gas sector holds no immediate implications for the Russian economy , over the course of the next few years , Russia will have to use Western technology to develop new oil fields . 
Otherwise , its oil output will stagnate or even fall , hitting the ruble and living standards hard . 
Financial markets and Russia &apos;s government understand the gravity of the medium-term risks . 
To avoid ruble depreciation and inflationary pressure , the CBR raised its benchmark interest rate to 8 % ( from 5.5 % before the Crimea crisis ) . 
But this may not be enough , given that Russia &apos;s recently introduced &quot; counter-sanctions &quot; - an embargo of food imports from the EU and the US - will contribute significantly to price growth . 
Since January , Russian stocks have lost 16 % of their value on the MSCI index , after already trading at a 50 % discount in 2013 , while Brazilian and Turkish equities are up by 13 % and 27 % , respectively . 
With MSCI now set to offer investors emerging-markets indices that exclude Russia , a massive sell-off of Russian stocks by index funds will drive down prices further . 
Indeed , the net capital outflow is expected to grow from $ 60 billion in 2013 to at least $ 100 billion dollars this year , with some estimates as high as $ 200 billion . 
One consequence of all of this is that the government can no longer balance its books and has started to discuss spending cuts and new taxes , in particular a sales tax . 
Over the last ten years , the question has been whether to keep the existing 18 % value-added tax or replace it with a sales tax . 
Now the debate is whether to introduce a sales tax on top of the VAT or to raise the VAT rate . 
In addition , Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has said that the government must use this year &apos;s pension contributions for projects in Crimea , while some highway construction has been postponed indefinitely . 
The government now says that it will expropriate next year &apos;s pension contributions as well ( Deputy Minister of Economic Development Sergei Belyakov was fired after publicly apologizing for the move ) . 
In a leaked letter , Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich explicitly acknowledged to Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev the impossibility of fulfilling Putin &apos;s spending promises , and proposed a radical revision of current fiscal plans . 
Apparently , fear of even more serious economic troubles - for example , further capital flight when taxes are raised - has precluded an open invasion of eastern Ukraine . 
Russian leaders seem to understand that , despite rising support for &quot; self-sufficiency , &quot; autarky has never worked for Russia . 
Even in the Stalin era - when the economy was much more closed than in Czarist times - industrialization required the import of Western capital and knowhow . 
More important , Putin &apos;s popularity rests on historically high living standards . 
Annual household consumption is now double the level achieved in the Soviet Union &apos;s dying days . 
Consumption growth has been driven largely by Russia &apos;s integration into the global economy - and cannot be sustained without it . 
The last generation of Soviet leaders well understood the importance of maintaining living standards , which is why they used revenues from oil and gas exports to import consumer goods . 
When oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s , household consumption collapsed ; soon after , so did the Soviet Union . 
Today , though oil prices remain high , Russia &apos;s budget and financial system face severe problems over the next 2-3 years . 
If the West introduces full-blown sanctions against the largest Russian banks - as the US has already done against relatively small banks - those problems may become insurmountable . 
How will Russia &apos;s government respond ? 
Putin cannot afford to return to the pre-Crimean status quo , which would be viewed domestically as a major political defeat . 
This implies that sanctions will remain in place . 
But , having already deployed political repression , censorship , and propaganda , Putin &apos;s tools for maintaining control as Russians &quot; living standards decline will be limited . 
The nature of that dilemma makes it impossible to predict what he will do next .
