The Crisis of Thai Democracy 
One year after he was re-elected in a landslide , Thailand &apos;s Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been forced to dissolve the National Assembly and call a snap election . 
Although his Thai Rak Thai ( TRT ) party commands a 75 % majority in the assembly , Thaksin is embattled . 
He remains immensely popular with rural voters and the urban poor , who comprise more than 60 % of Thailand &apos;s electorate , but he has been battling a fervent Bangkok-based insurrection against his rule by the intelligentsia and middle classes . 
They accuse Thaksin , Thailand &apos;s wealthiest businessman , of corruption and treason for the tax-free sale of his family-owned Shin Corporation to the Singapore government &apos;s Temasek Holdings for $ 1.9 billion . 
Thaksin &apos;s rapid reversal of political fortune attests to the limits of the ballot box , as well as to democratic shortcomings that now beset a host of developing countries , including regional neighbors such as the Philippines . 
Until recently , Thaksin appeared to be as unassailable at home as he was bold and credible abroad . 
Exploiting Thailand &apos;s deep urban-rural divide , Thaksin bulldozed his way to power in 2001 on a populist platform . 
He stirred up national pride and promised rural Thais that their country would rise to greatness following the devastating 1997 economic crisis . 
A raft of populist policies underpinned his first four-year government , from rural debt suspension and cheap universal healthcare to handing out $ 25,000 to each of 77,000 villages for entrepreneurial start-up funds . 
Reminiscent of development strategies prevalent in East Asia , Thaksin picked strategic niche industries to propel Thailand &apos;s economic expansion , focusing on automobiles , fashion , food , healthcare , and tourism . 
In foreign affairs , Thaksin carved out his own space on the international stage with ambitious regional cooperation schemes anchored around the 25-member Asia Cooperation Dialogue ( ACD ) , the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation ( ACMECS ) and a clutch of bilateral free-trade agreements with the major powers , including the US , China , Japan , India , and Australia . 
The ACD was designed to make Thailand the political center of gravity in Southeast Asia ; 
At his zenith , many saw Thaksin as a worthy successor to former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad , buoyed by authoritarian rule at home and assertive leadership abroad . 
Voters overwhelmingly returned Thaksin to office in February 2005 . 
But his personal popularity then plummeted , owing to the spate of separatist violence in the Muslim-dominated south and the scourge of corruption . 
Sins overlooked during his first term - from harassment of the media and coercion of civil society groups to extrajudicial killings in an anti-drug campaign and conflicts of interest that benefited his Shinawatra telecommunications empire - soon caught up with him . 
The shady sale of Shin Corporation in February galvanized long-simmering discontents . 
The deal was viewed as the epitome of Thaksin &apos;s sophisticated corruption and a betrayal of his proclaimed nationalism , thus exhausting his moral authority and political legitimacy . 
The company &apos;s value quadrupled during Thaksin &apos;s reign , with assets such as satellites , a mobile phone service , and an airline having originated from state concessions that were conditioned on majority Thai ownership . 
For Thaksin &apos;s opponents , the sale of these assets to a foreign company owned by a foreign government amounted to putting Thailand &apos;s economic sovereignty on the block . 
Thaksin &apos;s days appear numbered , for Thailand seems poised to eject a popularly elected prime minister . 
The number of street protesters has since swelled from five digits to six . 
His predicament illustrates the common dictum in the politics of developing countries where rural electorates elect governments but urban elites get to throw them out . 
Indeed , the anti-Thaksin coalition will settle for no less than his ouster from office , permanent banishment from Thai politics , and possibly exile . 
But the opposition has decided to boycott the snap election , which the TRT would likely win again by a large margin , because Thaksin has captured and manipulated the institutions established by the constitution to safeguard against graft and uphold separation of powers within the state . 
Thai politics has thus reached an impasse . 
Only intervention by King Bhumibol Adulyadej , who is widely revered , seems capable of saving the day . 
In a fiercely contested battle between Thaksin and his opponents , King Bhumibol is the fundamental difference between Thailand and the Philippines , where &quot; people power &quot; revolts regularly undermine and sometimes overthrow presidents . 
The King &apos;s intervention would put an unconditional stop to the street confrontations . 
But the Thai people cannot afford to look to their aging and ailing King every time they have a problem . 
Moreover , a royal intervention would risk returning Thailand to square one , seeking to rewrite its constitution to remedy the shortfalls of its democratic culture . 
What Thai democracy needs in order to mature is not a political safety net , but a vigilant citizenry to ensure disciplined enforcement of the constitution &apos;s provisions and institutions , so that they can no longer be hijacked by the likes of a Thaksin .
