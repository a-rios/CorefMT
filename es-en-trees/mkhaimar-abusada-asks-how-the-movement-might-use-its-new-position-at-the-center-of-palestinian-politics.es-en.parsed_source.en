Did Hamas Win ? 
GAZA CITY - This summer &apos;s 51-day war on Gaza left more than 2,100 Palestinians dead , over 11,000 injured , and vast areas of devastation that will take years to rebuild . 
After the third Israeli war on Gaza in less than six years , many Palestinians are questioning the purpose of continuing to fight - and hoping for a solution that does not increase their suffering . 
Can Hamas , with its newly acquired position at the forefront of Palestinian politics , provide such a solution ? 
Before the latest war erupted , Hamas was politically isolated . 
It had lost traditional allies in Syria , Iran , and Hezbollah . 
Most damaging , the ouster of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi &apos;s Muslim Brotherhood government had deprived Hamas of its lifeline of supplies and armaments . 
Egypt &apos;s military regime , led by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi , has been unrelentingly hostile toward Hamas , blaming it for the fighting in Sinai between the army and insurgent groups . 
Egypt even mounted an operation to destroy the tunnels between Gaza and Sinai , isolating Gaza completely . 
Hamas faced an intensifying crisis . 
Unable to pay the salaries of more than 40,000 public employees in Gaza , it was being slowly strangled by the Israeli and Egyptian authorities . 
And the unity government that it established with the Palestinian Authority in June brought no relief . 
With nothing to lose , Hamas decided that another round of fighting with Israel was the only way to shake things up . 
Despite its modest military capabilities , Hamas managed to hold out for 51 days - and , in the process , place itself at the center of Palestinian and regional politics . 
Israel , by contrast , failed to achieve any of its goals - beginning with restoring its deterrent capacity . 
Indeed , despite Israel &apos;s best efforts , Hamas continued to launch long-range missiles at major populated areas from Haifa in the north to Ashkelon and Dimona in the south , and it repeatedly crossed Israeli lines using underground tunnels . 
Such achievements shattered the indomitable image of the Israeli army , exposing a weakness that other radical Islamist groups may attempt to exploit . 
Against this background , it is perhaps unsurprising that Hamas managed to compel most Israelis living in areas adjacent to Gaza to flee , with many Israelis accusing their government of failing to protect its citizens adequately . 
In short , the war in Gaza shook the status quo . 
It did not , however , bring about any progress toward resolving the outstanding issues underlying the dispute between Israel and Hamas , or change the conditions that spurred the latest conflict in the first place . 
Israel did agree to terms much like those that ended its last assault on Gaza in 2012 ; but that agreement was never implemented . 
Israel is now expected , for example , to ease its blockade of Gaza and allow the transport of humanitarian and construction supplies . 
But more complicated issues , such as the release of Palestinian prisoners and the establishment of a Gaza airport and seaport , will be left for next month &apos;s discussions . 
And there is no guarantee that Israel will accede to Hamas &apos;s demands without disarming Gaza . 
The stakes for Hamas could not be higher . 
By breaking Gaza &apos;s political isolation , the ceasefire has fueled hope of relief from economic and financial deprivation . 
Given Hamas &apos;s leading role , it will be held accountable not only for the success of Gaza &apos;s reconstruction , but also for any further delays in Palestinian reconciliation . 
Hamas also faces pressure from the international community , which , despite supporting the Palestinians &quot; demand for an end to the Israeli siege and blockade , is adamant that Israel &apos;s security concerns also be addressed . 
As United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned , &quot; Any peace effort that does not tackle the root causes of the crisis will do little other than set the stage for the next cycle of violence . &quot; 
In other words , achieving a lasting peace deal will require compromises from both sides - the kind of compromises that Hamas has long resisted . 
For its part , the international community must embrace Hamas &apos;s involvement in the pursuit of a peaceful settlement of the Palestine-Israel conflict . 
Former Israeli President Shimon Peres once said , &quot; The real challenge is to transform any crisis , however large , into new opportunities for action . &quot; 
It is time for all of the relevant actors in the conflict between Israel and Palestine to address this challenge , and to take concrete , productive , and creative action to bring peace to Gaza at last . 
Hamas has proved its staying power . 
After decades of standoffs and stalemate , perhaps it can focus less on its own survival and more on helping to achieve a just and lasting peace .
