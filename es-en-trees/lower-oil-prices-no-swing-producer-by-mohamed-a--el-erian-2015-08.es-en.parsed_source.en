Oil &apos;s New Normal 
LAGUNA BEACH - Oil prices have been heading south again , with a barrel of US crude recently falling below $ 42 - the lowest level since March 2009 , the nadir of the global financial crisis . 
And , while last year &apos;s sharp price drop was heavily influenced by two large supply shocks , the current decline also has an important demand dimension . 
At the same time , oil markets are discovering what it is like to operate under the regime of a new swing producer : the United States . 
As a result , the price formation process is much clumsier nowadays , with considerably longer adjustment lags . 
The dynamics of the energy markets changed notably as shale-oil production came onstream at a market-moving scale in 2013-2014 . 
With this new source meeting more of world energy demand , particularly in the US , energy users were no longer as dependent on OPEC and other oil producers . 
In the process , they also became less vulnerable to geopolitical concerns . 
Adding to the supply-side changes was Saudi Arabia &apos;s subsequent historic announcement that it would no longer lead OPEC in playing the role of swing producer . 
It would no longer lower production when prices fell sharply , and increase output in response to large price surges . 
That decision was both understandable and rational . 
Playing the role of swing producer was coming at a growing cost to both current and future generations of Saudi citizens . 
Non-traditional suppliers had increased their market influence , non-OPEC producers continued to plan high output , and some OPEC members failed to adhere to their production ceilings . 
Given all this , Saudi Arabia could no longer be expected to incur the growing short- and long-term cost of being the stabilizing market force that it had been for decades . 
Such fundamental changes in the supply side of the market naturally drove oil prices lower - a lot lower . 
Prices plummeted by more than half in a period of just a few months last year , catching many oil traders and analysts by surprise . 
Oil prices stabilized after a somewhat temporary overshoot , trading increasingly robustly for a while on the back of two conventional market reactions . 
First , the large price drop caused massive supply destruction , as some energy producers , from both the traditional and non-traditional sectors , became unprofitable . 
Second , as consumers reacted to lower energy costs , demand adjusted only gradually . 
But a new factor soon disturbed this relative stability , pushing oil prices even lower : Evidence that the global economy was weakening , and that much of the weakening was occurring in relatively energy-intensive countries such as China and Brazil , as well as Russia ( itself an energy producer ) . 
Today , indicators of this global slowdown are to be found everywhere - from underwhelming retail and trade data to unanticipated policy responses , including China &apos;s surprise currency devaluation ( which coincides with its leaders &quot; commitment to a long-term shift toward a more market-based exchange-rate regime ) . 
The impact is not limited to economic performance and financial-market movements . 
Slower global growth is also amplifying political pressures and , in some countries , adding to social strains - both of which tend to constrain policy responses . 
It is hard to see the global oil market &apos;s current configuration of supply and demand rapidly changing any time soon . 
As for the new swing producer , the US has a much slower ( and leakier ) reaction function relative to that of Saudi Arabia and OPEC . 
Over the next few months , the US will indeed alter its supply and demand conditions in a way that puts a floor under oil prices and enables a gradual recovery in the market . 
Indeed , we should expect an even sharper reduction in US energy output as persistently low prices increase the pressure on domestic producers . 
From the shutdown of additional rigs to the curtailment of new investment in exploiting shale resources , the US will likely experience a fall in its absolute energy production , as well as in its share of world output . 
But , while demand will increase , this will not have much of an immediate effect on oil prices . 
Yes , US consumers will be tempted to buy more trucks and bigger cars , drive more miles , and fly to more places . 
At the end of the day , no swing producer controls the fate of today &apos;s oil prices . 
A sustained price recovery requires a healthier global economy that combines faster inclusive growth and greater financial stability .
