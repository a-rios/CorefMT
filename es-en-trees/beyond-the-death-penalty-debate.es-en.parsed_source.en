Beyond the Death Penalty Debate 
China &apos;s decision to execute the head of its drug regulatory agency has rekindled international debate about capital punishment . 
It is an age-old question , one that harks back to Plato , who in his &quot; Laws &quot; saw the need to punish by death those who commit egregious crimes . 
Supporters of capital punishment usually put forward three arguments to justify state-sanctioned killing of those who take the life of another . 
First , there is the old law of &quot; an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . &quot; 
In the words of Immanuel Kant , not some Texas governor , no other &quot; penalty is capable of satisfying justice . &quot; 
Then there is a utilitarian argument : capital punishment deters many criminals from murder . 
Furthermore , killing murderers prevents recidivism : if released from prison , they might kill again . 
The third argument is also utilitarian , although of a lower quality : the state saves money by killing murderers instead of keeping them in prison for life at the expense of the community . 
Abolitionists respond with two ethical arguments . 
First , in a modern democracy , punishment must be not only retributive , but should also try to rehabilitate the criminal in order to enable him to live in society with other human beings . 
The second ethical argument is based on the commandment &quot; thou shalt not kill &quot; which also enjoins the state from killing . 
Opponents of the death penalty also rely on utilitarian arguments . 
The death penalty is irreversible . 
If a convict turns out to be innocent , his execution cannot be undone . 
Moreover , abolitionists assail the deterrent effect of the death penalty . 
Thucydides , in recounting the Athenians &quot; discussion of what penalty to impose on the rebellious Mytilenians , noted that &quot; the death penalty has been laid down for many offenses , yet people still take risks when they feel sufficiently confident ; it is impossible for human nature , once seriously set upon a certain course , to be prevented from following that course by the force of law or by any other means of intimidation whatsoever . &quot; 
Criminologists have shown , statistically , that in US states where convicts are executed , serious crimes have not diminished . 
Other criminologists argue that this finding , if well-founded , should then apply to any criminal law : every day , criminal prohibitions are infringed ; yet if we did not have such prohibitions , crimes would be even more rampant . 
In their view , capital punishment serves at least to restrain the homicidal leanings of human beings . 
So the death penalty debate boils down to an exchange of conflicting ethical and utilitarian views . 
I , for one , believe that the death penalty radically negates the doctrine of human rights , which is founded on respect for life and the dignity of human beings . 
But , whether or not you oppose the death penalty , two lessons can be drawn from the debate . 
First , the fight for human dignity and respect for life , as with any struggle for human rights , is set in motion and tenaciously pursued by members of civil society , by individuals more than by states . 
It was a representative of the Age of Reason , Cesare Beccaria , who first advocated in 1764 , in a few pages of a seminal booklet , the abolition of capital punishment . 
Indeed , it is thanks to a few thinkers and activists that states have gradually moved away from age-old tenets . 
As Tommaso Campanella , a great philosopher who spent much time in prison and was tortured because of his ideas , wrote a few centuries ago , &quot; history is changed first by the tongue and then by the sword . &quot; 
Nowadays , it is associations such as Amnesty International and Hands Off Cain that push states to abolish capital punishment . 
The second lesson is that the death penalty debate should not absorb all our attention . 
If we intend to abolish the gallows , we should also fight for the prevention of crime and against the inhumanity of many prisons . 
After all , what is the point of suggesting imprisonment as an alternative to electrocution , if inmates are subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment ? 
How can we ignore that a high number of inmates commit suicide - self-inflicted capital punishment - to escape the inhumanity of their imprisonment ? 
How can we ignore that many states today kill not only through legal punishment , but also by murdering and massacring in international or civil wars , or by allowing starvation ? 
In short , opposition to the death penalty cannot be an end in itself , for it is only one element of a more general fight for human dignity .
