The Bailout Bias 
WARSAW - The seemingly never-ending debate over the eurozone &apos;s fiscal problems has focused excessively on official bailouts , in particular the proposed purchase of government bonds on a massive scale by the European Central Bank . 
Indeed , we are warned almost daily - by the International Monetary Fund and others - that if bailout efforts are not greatly expanded , the euro will perish . 
For some , this stance reflects the benefits that they would gain from such purchases ; for others , it reflects mistaken beliefs . 
Creditors obviously support bailing out debtor countries to protect themselves . 
Many political leaders also welcome official crisis lending , which can ease market pressure on them . 
The media , meanwhile , always thrives on being the bearers of bad news . 
Mistaken beliefs , on the other hand , are reflected in metaphors like &quot; contagion &quot; and &quot; domino effect , &quot; which imply that financial markets become blind , virulent , and indiscriminate when they are disturbed . 
Such terms provoke fear that , once confidence in any one country is lost , all others are in danger . 
According to this logic , it follows that only a formidable countervailing power - such as massive official intervention - can halt the ravenous dynamics of financial markets . 
Widespread use of expressions like &quot; aim a bazooka at the eurozone , &quot; and &quot; it &apos;s them or us , &quot; demonstrates a pervasive Manichean view of financial-market behavior vis-Ã -vis governments . 
But financial markets , even when agitated , are not blind . 
They are capable of distinguishing , however imperfectly and belatedly , between macroeconomic conditions in various countries . 
This is why interest-rate spreads within the eurozone have been widening , with Germany and the Nordic countries benefiting from lower borrowing costs and the &quot; problem &quot; countries being punished by a high-risk premium . 
Another , related , fallacy is the assumption that reforms can reap benefits only in the long run . 
This misconception reduces the short-term solution to affected governments &quot; sharply higher borrowing costs to bailouts . 
In fact , properly structured reforms have both short- and long-term effects . 
For example , one does not need to wait for the completion of a pension reform to see reduced yields on government bonds . 
Markets react to credible announcements of reforms , as well as to their implementation . 
The countries that have been severely affected by the financial crisis illustrate the impact of reform . 
One group - Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania ( BELL ) - experienced a surge in yields on their government bonds in 2009 , followed by a sharp decline . 
Another group - Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece , and Spain ( PIIGS ) - has had more mixed outcomes : yields have soared on Greek and Portuguese bonds , while Ireland &apos;s were falling until recently . 
These differences can be explained largely by the variations in the extent and structure of these countries &quot; reforms . 
Proper reforms can produce confidence and growth . 
Official crisis lending can buy time to prepare , and it can help to stop a banking-sector crisis , but it cannot substitute for reform . 
All bailouts can create moral hazard , because they weaken the incentive to implement reforms that will avoid bad outcomes in the future . 
To some extent , official crisis lending replaces the pressure from financial markets with pressure from experts and creditor countries &quot; politicians . 
Among the proposed eurozone bailouts , none has come under the spotlight as much as the idea that the ECB should purchase massive quantities of the problem countries &quot; bonds . 
Advocates of this approach stretch the concept of &quot; lender of last resort &quot; to suggest that providing liquidity to commercial banks is the same as funding governments . 
They also present the alternative to a bailout as a &quot; catastrophe . &quot; 
Finally , they cite similar policies implemented by the United States Federal Reserve , the Bank of England , and the Bank of Japan - as though merely mentioning past examples is evidence that ECB lending will work . 
These rhetorical devices must not overshadow careful analysis of the various options . 
There has been surprisingly little comparative analysis of the effects of quantitative easing ( QE ) in Japan , the US , and Britain . 
Yet the evidence indicates that QE is no free lunch . 
Although it may offer potential benefits in the short run , costs and risks invariably emerge later . 
In Japan , QE may have contributed to delays in economic reform and restructuring , thereby weakening longer-term economic growth and exacerbating fiscal distress . 
In the US , it failed to avert the slowdown during 2008-2011 , while America &apos;s 2011 inflation figures may turn out to be higher than they were in 2007 . 
In Britain , economic growth is even slower , while inflation is much higher . 
And these countries &quot; QE has also fueled asset bubbles in the world economy . 
Massive purchases of government bonds by the ECB would be the worst type of bailout . 
The fact that such purchases are potentially unlimited would exacerbate the problem of moral hazard . 
It would also increase the risk of inflation , along with other negative economic consequences . 
Moreover , such a bailout could undermine the ECB &apos;s trustworthiness as guardian of the euro &apos;s stability , particularly in light of the new political power that it would obtain . 
The key to resolving the eurozone crisis lies in properly structured reforms in the ailing countries . 
Indeed , experience shows that there is no substitute .
