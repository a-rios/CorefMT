Less Carbon Can Mean More Growth Indeed , if we are smart , public policy can serve the twin goals of stimulating growth and fighting global warming . 
Governments hammering out a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol at the United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen later this year should adopt strong incentives to cut greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Doing so could kick-start private investment and help to fuel economic recovery . 
The broad outlines of an effective and efficient response to global warming have been clear for years . 
A system to cap CO2 emissions and trade emission allowances would channel resources toward the most cost-effective reduction measures . 
And widespread adoption of efficiency standards for appliances , vehicles , and buildings would help companies and individuals use less energy . 
Moreover , several specific policy initiatives could help government and society better harness companies &quot; agility and innovative power in the quest to control greenhouse-gas emissions : 
· Agreements among groups of key countries to reduce emissions in specific industrial sectors ; 
· Incentives for companies to capture CO2 and store it safely underground , accelerating the deployment of this promising technology ; 
· Technology funds to support the development and commercial demonstration of new technologies , such as advanced biofuels , with high potential for lowering CO2 emissions . 
Until now , negotiators have aimed for a global deal palatable to developed and developing countries alike . 
While that remains the ultimate goal , it has so far proven devilishly complex to formulate . 
A possible stepping-stone would be agreements between smaller groups of pivotal countries to cap emissions from individual high-emitting sectors of their economies . 
Such agreements could be important building blocks for a broader deal . 
Sectors to focus on include power generation , which accounts for about 35 % of global CO2 emissions , and production of cement , chemicals , and steel . 
Involving a limited number of the most important countries would facilitate a compromise . 
Such deals would ease concern in competitive global industries that strict emission rules in one region would put companies at a disadvantage relative to rivals in countries with less strict policies . 
As a hypothetical example , an agreement on emissions from coal-fired power stations might include large users such as China , the European Union , India , Japan , and the United States , which together account for about 80 % of global coal-fired capacity . 
Such a deal could include mechanisms for transferring clean-coal technology from developed countries to developing ones . 
Cap-and-trade systems could provide a potential source of funds through the auctioning of emission allowances . 
The need is urgent . 
Asia alone will build some 800 gigawatts of new coal-fired generating capacity over the next 10 years , equal to the EU &apos;s total electricity generating capacity today . 
Once built , the plants will emit more than four billion tons of CO2 each year - about the same as the EU &apos;s total energy-related emissions - and operate for 30 years or more . 
Climate negotiators should also give CO2 capture and storage ( CCS ) high priority . 
While increased use of renewable and nuclear energy will help reduce emissions , by themselves they will not be able to keep up with fast-growing energy demand . 
Fossil fuels , like it or not , will remain the world &apos;s main source of energy for decades . 
Indeed , &quot; cleaning up &quot; fossil fuels is a necessary and vital bridge to a low-carbon future . 
According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , CCS may contribute up to 55 % of the emission reductions that scientists believe are necessary during this century to address global warming . 
But companies are reluctant to invest in CCS because it adds substantial cost and generates no revenue . 
If CCS is to fulfill its potential , companies need incentives to invest and a way to make money . 
Policymakers should promote CCS in several ways . 
First , they must put a price on CO2 emissions . 
They could do so by capping emissions and creating a market where companies can buy and sell emission allowances , as in the European Emissions Trading Scheme . 
Second , CCS needs to be recognized within the Kyoto Protocol &apos;s Clean Development Mechanism , through which developed countries can invest in emission-reduction projects in developing countries . 
Finally , governments should stimulate the development and commercial demonstration of technologies that hold promise for a low-carbon energy future . 
The dramatic drop in energy prices in recent months makes it less likely that private investors will gamble on unproven technologies . 
Clearly , strapped treasuries will have difficulty providing funds . 
For example , the EU recently set aside 300 million tradable emission allowances , to be awarded to innovative renewable energy projects or CO2 storage projects . 
Depending on the market price for a ton of CO2 , that could mean about € 6-9 billion in assistance to get such new technologies up to scale . 
No one knows if the economic crisis will last months or years . 
But a good outcome in Copenhagen will serve the world for decades to come by sparking growth and taking steps to control greenhouse-gas emissions .
