The Right Price for Preserving Our Climate 
WASHINGTON , DC - When world leaders convene in Paris this week for the United Nations Climate Change Conference , their task will be to reach a global agreement on curbing greenhouse-gas emissions . 
A successful outcome , demonstrating that countries can work together for the good of the planet , would send a powerful message of hope to the world - and to the people of Paris , who remain unbowed after the recent terrorist attacks . 
Climate pledges will be made on the basis of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ( INDCs ) , or commitments to the reduction of emissions worldwide . 
I believe that the price of emissions should be at the center of these pledges . 
Achieving a decline in greenhouse-gas emissions at the lowest possible cost requires a revolution in energy use and production . 
Gradual , predictable , and reliable increases in energy prices would provide strong incentives for consumers to reduce their energy bills . 
At the same time , the right carbon price would enable a smooth transition away from fossil fuels by encouraging investments in technological innovation . 
That is why the International Monetary Fund &apos;s staff have recommended a three-part strategy on carbon fuel : &quot; price it right , tax it smart , and do it now . &quot; 
Each component is essential . 
First , setting the right price for fossil fuels means taking into account their true environmental costs . 
Prices should pass on to end users the full cost not only of production and acquisition , but also of the damage - including air pollution and climate change - caused by intensive reliance on fossil fuels . 
A fairer carbon price will drive energy savings and boost demand for cleaner fuels and &quot; greener &quot; investments . 
Second , the necessary change in prices would be achieved by taxing energy , using tools that are both practical and efficient . 
The best option is to build a carbon charge into existing fuel taxes and apply similar charges to coal , natural gas , and other petroleum products . 
The revenue implications would be significant . 
If large emitting countries were to impose carbon prices of $ 30 per ton of CO2 , they could generate fiscal revenues amounting to about 1 % of their GDP . 
These revenues could be used to manage the overall fiscal burden of climate action , as well as to finance cuts in taxes on labor and capital that distort economic activity and harm growth , or to reduce deficits where needed . 
In short , carbon pricing is about &quot; smart &quot; taxes , not higher taxes . 
Smart taxes should be phased in gradually to allow households and firms time to adjust and for new technologies to come on stream . 
Gradual and tailored adjustment is particularly important for developing economies , many of which make little contribution to global emissions . 
Time may be necessary , in many cases , to ensure that social safety nets are in place to protect low-income households and to provide retraining programs for workers in energy-intensive industries . 
This approach would also allow for climate investments to be financed through private capital flows . 
Third , there is no time to lose : policymakers need to act immediately . 
Given the slump in energy prices , there has never been a better time to undertake the transition to smart , credible , and effective carbon pricing . 
Nor should countries wait for others to move first . 
Work at the IMF has shown that a fair amount of carbon pricing is in many countries &quot; national interest - even ignoring adverse climate effects on other countries - because it would help resolve major domestic environmental problems . 
According to the World Health Organization , outdoor air pollution causes more than three million premature deaths a year . 
And early action is essential to avoid the need for much more drastic - and costly - efforts later . 
Ahead of the Paris summit , more than 160 countries submitted emissions mitigation pledges . 
By implementing these commitments , countries will substantially reduce projected future global warming . 
The challenge now is to deliver on these pledges . 
In Paris , a select group of leaders who are true champions of carbon pricing will issue a call for action . 
The Carbon Pricing Panel , led by the IMF and World Bank , will further increase the policy momentum at the national , regional , and municipal levels . 
In addition to public-sector efforts , we also need the robust engagement of financial institutions and markets . 
Hedging instruments such as so-called catastrophe bonds can help insure against the increasing risk posed by natural disasters . 
Other financial instruments , such as &quot; green &quot; stock indices and &quot; green &quot; bonds , can help reallocate investment to sectors that support environmentally sustainable growth . 
Here , too , carbon prices that are predictable and sufficiently high will be essential to guide investment choices . 
There is a lot at stake this week in the City of Light . 
Paris recently experienced humanity at its worst . 
The climate summit will be an opportunity to show it at its best .
