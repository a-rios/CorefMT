The Allure of Asia 
President Bush is in Asia to attend the Asian Pacific Economic Council in China , but he should pay attention to another Asian summit to which he was not invited . 
In December , Malaysia will host an East Asian meeting that deliberately excludes the United States . 
According to many close observers , America &apos;s attractiveness is declining in the region where the allure , or &quot; soft power , &quot; of others has increased . 
Asian countries have impressive potential resources for soft power . 
The arts , fashion , and cuisine of Asia &apos;s ancient cultures have had a strong impact on other parts of the world for centuries , but Asia went through a period of relative decline as it lagged behind the industrial revolution in the West , and this undermined its influence . 
In the 1950 &quot; s , Asia conjured up images of poverty and starvation . 
There was a brief political infatuation among some Westerners in the 1960 &quot; s with Nehru jackets and Maoist revolution , but it was brief . 
As John Lennon sang in 1968 , &quot; if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao , you ain &apos;t gonna make it with anyone anyhow . &quot; 
Asia &apos;s resurgence began with Japan &apos;s economic success . 
By the end of the century , Japan &apos;s remarkable performance not only made the Japanese wealthy , but also enhanced the country &apos;s soft power . 
As the first non-Western country that drew even with the West in modernity while showing that it is possible to maintain a unique culture , Japan has more potential soft-power resources than any other Asian country . 
Today Japan ranks first in the world in the number of patents , third in expenditure on research and development as a share of GDP , second in book sales and music sales , and highest for life expectancy . 
It is home to three of the top twenty-five multinational brand names ( Toyota , Honda , and Sony ) . 
The decade-long economic slowdown of the 1990 &quot; s tarnished Japan &apos;s reputation , but it did not erase Japan &apos;s soft-power resources . 
Japan &apos;s global cultural influence grew in areas ranging from fashion , food , and pop music to consumer electronics , architecture , and art . 
Japanese manufacturers rule the roost in home video games . 
Pokemon cartoons are broadcast in 65 countries , and Japanese animation is a huge hit with filmmakers and teenagers everywhere . 
In short , Japan &apos;s popular culture was still producing potential soft-power resources even after its economy slowed down . 
Now , with signs of a reviving economy , Japan &apos;s soft power may increase even more . 
But there are limits . 
Unlike Germany , which repudiated its past aggression and reconciled with its neighbors in the framework of the European Union , Japan has never come to terms with its record in the 1930 &quot; s and 1940 &quot; s . 
The residual suspicion that lingers in countries like China and Korea sets limits on Japan &apos;s appeal that are reinforced every time the Japanese prime minister visits the Yasukuni Shrine . 
Japan also faces serious demographic challenges . 
By mid-century , Japan &apos;s population could shrink by 30 % unless it attracts 17 million immigrants - a hard task in a country historically resistant to immigration . 
Moreover , the Japanese language is not widely spoken , and Japan &apos;s meager English-language skills make it difficult to attract international talent to its universities . 
Japan &apos;s culture remains inward-looking . 
Looking ahead , China and India are the looming giants of Asia , with their huge populations and rapid economic growth rates . 
Not only are their military , or &quot; hard power , &quot; resources growing ; there are signs that their soft-power resources are increasing , too . 
In 2000 , Chinese novelist Gao Xingjian won China &apos;s first Nobel prize for literature , followed a year later by the Indian diaspora writer V.S. Naipaul . 
The Chinese film &quot; Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon &quot; became the highest grossing non-English film , and Indian movies like &quot; Monsoon Wedding &quot; were global box-office successes . 
Indeed , &quot; Bollywood &quot; produces more movies every year than Hollywood . 
The list goes on . 
Yao Ming , the Chinese star of the National Basketball Association &apos;s Houston Rockets , could become another Michael Jordan , and China is set to host the 2008 Summer Olympics . 
Large expatriate communities in the US - 2.4 million Chinese and 1.7 million Indians - have increased interest in their home countries among other Americans . 
Moreover , transnational connections in the information industry are close , as Western high-tech companies increasingly employ affiliates in Bangalore and Shanghai to provide real-time services . 
But the real promise for China and India lies in the future . 
A country &apos;s soft power rests upon the attractiveness of its culture , the appeal of its domestic political and social values , and the style and substance of its foreign policies . 
In recent years , both China and India have adopted foreign policies that have increased their attractiveness to others . 
While culture provides some soft power , domestic policies and values set limits , particularly in China , where the Communist Party fears allowing too much intellectual freedom and resists outside influences . 
Both countries have a reputation for corruption in government . 
India benefits from democratic politics , but suffers from overly bureaucratized government . 
In foreign policy as well , both countries &quot; reputations are burdened with the problems of longstanding disputes over Taiwan and Kashmir . 
Moreover , in the US , the attraction of an authoritarian China is limited by the concern that it could become a future threat . 
The soft power of Asian countries , then , lags behind that of the US , Europe , and Japan , but it is likely to increase . 
Indeed , if the US continues to pursue unattractive policies , it may find that its absence from the summit in Malaysia in December is a harbinger of things to come .
