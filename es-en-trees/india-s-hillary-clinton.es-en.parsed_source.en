India &apos;s Hillary Clinton ? 
As Americans debate their readiness to accept a woman such as Hillary Clinton as president , India has already done so , with the election of Pratibha Patil . 
Although India &apos;s presidency is primarily a ceremonial post that carries less weight than that of prime minister ( the position once held by Indira Gandhi ) , it is symbolically significant . 
Sonia Gandhi , the leader of the ruling Congress Party , who pushed hard to promote Patil &apos;s candidacy primarily on gender grounds , calls this election &quot; a special moment for women across the country . &quot; 
Moreover , India can claim a great deal of pride in the fact that the last two presidents were from minority populations - one from the lowest of castes ( Harijan , formerly referred to as &quot; untouchables &quot; ) , and another one from the Muslim community . 
As a daughter of a woman who fought for women &apos;s rights during the independence movement and was instrumental in starting one of the first women &apos;s institutions in India , I should feel a genuine sense of pride in the election of Patil . 
But at best I have mixed emotions . 
Both of India &apos;s last two presidents had distinguished themselves in professional careers before being elected - one in the Foreign Service and the other in nuclear physics - and their reputations were above reproach . 
Patil , on the other hand , is a controversial figure , with questionable qualifications . 
Most of India &apos;s major news outlets highlighted in their coverage of the story charges of corruption and ineptitude . 
One well-respected publication even called Mrs. Patil &apos;s selection &quot; embarrassing . &quot; 
Women hear over and over that we have to be twice as good as men to be perceived as successful , deserving leaders . 
Even if we disregard some of the accusations against Patil as baseless , it is hard to imagine a less powerful candidate for the highest ceremonial post in the largest democracy in the world . 
All the same , I applaud Sonia Gandhi for her commitment to appointing a woman to this important position . 
In a country full of contradictory attitudes toward women - ranging from the worship of the powerful goddess Durga to the killing of innocent young brides - such gestures can be very powerful . 
But gestures cannot be a substitute for real action , or for the hard work that is necessary to empower all Indian women . 
Indeed , one could argue that such symbolic acts may even create a blind euphoria that obscures the fact that , as a result of less education and lower pay , young females in India continue to have far fewer resources than their male counterparts . 
While India &apos;s president may be only a ceremonial head of state , during periods of political instability - especially in the current age of coalition governments - it is the president who makes crucial decisions about governing parties . 
Many past presidents have also used the position to throw their intellectual weight behind such important issues as education and India &apos;s cultural diversity . 
So President Patil has large shoes to fill . 
One can only hope that she will prove her critics wrong . 
For those women in India who have proven themselves to be effective leaders in all segments of society , it would be wonderful if she can demonstrate early on that she has the intellectual and professional gravitas that befits the position .
