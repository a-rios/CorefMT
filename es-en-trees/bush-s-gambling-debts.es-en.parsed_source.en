Bush &apos;s Gambling Debts 
George W. Bush &apos;s economic policies have been based on an extraordinarily reckless gamble that reflects a political coalition of two major forces : the super-rich and evangelical Christians . 
As those policies fail , global financial markets are reacting negatively , adding uncertainty to the world economy , and there is little relief in sight , because America is entering a period of prolonged political infighting and stalemate . 
The super-rich had one over-riding objective in joining the Bush coalition : tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest households . 
Evangelicals were brought in on the basis of so-called &quot; family values , &quot; meaning opposition to abortion and gay marriage , and promises of active government support for religious activities , including direct payments to religious groups for social services that they provide locally and internationally . 
The Bush team believed that they would eventually balance the tax cuts for the rich with reductions in government spending , but they never explained this to the public . 
Instead , for four years they pretended that budget deficits were of little concern . 
Only after being re-elected did they begin to explain that large budget deficits , caused mainly by lower tax revenues , would require sharp cuts in social security , health care spending , and other areas . 
But the majority of Americans , having supported the tax cuts in Bush &apos;s first term because it gave them a little extra cash , do not support the attack on basic government services that has followed . 
This opposition extends to Christian evangelicals voters , who tend to live in working-class and middle-class households that depend on many kinds of government social services . 
Despite the avowedly &quot; free-market &quot; beliefs of many Christian fundamentalists , as voters they support government-financed pensions , health care , and other public services . 
Bush &apos;s tax cutting was irresponsible from the start , but became much more so after September 11 , 2001 . 
The Bush administration raised military spending sharply as it went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq , and as it increased spending on national security at home , without ever explaining to the American people how this would be financed . 
The military-plus-security budget soared by more than 2 % of GNP , while tax revenues fell by much more . 
At the same time , Bush supported expenditure increases for popular items like education and prescription drug benefits , but paid for these services by borrowing the money rather than ensuring sufficient tax revenues . 
No sooner did this strategy pay off with a narrow re-election victory - one that strengthened Republican control of Congress - than the dark realities of Bush &apos;s fiscal recklessness started to be recognized . 
The annual US budget deficit reached 5 % of GNP , with an enormous part of the gap financed each year by Asian central banks , which now hold about $ 2 trillion in claims against America . 
The problem is that Bush &apos;s reckless gamble has now built up considerable political momentum . 
As soon as he was re-elected , Bush started to propose cuts in popular government programs , but his own party is rejecting those cuts . 
With the Republican-controlled Congress seeking to make the tax cuts for the rich permanent , the world is beginning to realize that America &apos;s budget deficits are now entrenched , with no end in sight . 
Because America &apos;s economy is so large , and the dollar so central to global finance , chronic US budget deficits mean huge global repercussions . 
The dollar is weakening , as financial markets understand that the US will need to borrow huge sums from abroad for years to come . 
More ominously , the willingness of foreign central banks to lend to the US also looks likely to end . 
In a bizarre , but not unexpected way , America is lashing out at others for its problems . 
Huge tax cuts and rising military spending have fueled an enormous rise in imports , and therefore a yawning trade deficit now accompanies America &apos;s weak fiscal position . 
This response to homegrown problems plays well with voters , but it is ridiculous and ignorant , especially since the US has been depending on China to help finance the fiscal deficits . 
In essence , the US is lashing out at its own banker , even as it asks the banker for yet more loans ! 
When Bush asked for spending cuts at the beginning of the year - including a social security reform that includes cuts in future benefits - world financiers expected that Bush would get his way , or most of it . 
Little did they appreciate that American voters , having never actually supported spending cuts , would resist . 
As that reality sinks in , economic prospects darken . 
Foreigners will become less enthusiastic about continued lending to the US , weakening the dollar further , forcing up US interest rates , and threatening to undermine America &apos;s stock market and consumer spending . 
But as the storm clouds gather in the coming year , the political coalition that put Bush in power will stifle progress in undoing the fiscal mess . 
Bush &apos;s gamble was a loser from the start , generating costly results - mainly for the US , but for the rest of the world , too - for years to come .
