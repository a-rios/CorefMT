Deconstructing Saleh 
LONDON - Ali Abdullah Saleh is finished as Yemen &apos;s president . 
Popular democratic protests that started on a small scale in mid-February outside Sanaa University have widened to encompass the whole country . 
The continuity and strength of the demonstrations clearly indicate that the regime &apos;s days are numbered . 
Tribal leaders have joined the protesters . 
Even close allies who belong to Saleh &apos;s own Hashid tribe , such as Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar , have abandoned him . 
Now , even his long-term protector , the United States , seems to be abandoning him . 
Saleh , who has been in power since 1978 , knows that his time is up . 
&quot; They are falling like leaves in autumn , &quot; he recently said of the regime &apos;s defectors . 
Resignations have increased : ambassadors , ministers , significant media figures , and army generals . 
It is the last group that is decisive : when senior military and security personnel abandon an authoritarian regime in the face of popular pressure , its days are numbered . 
Yet Saleh retains the loyalty of the interior ministry , the Republican Guard , and part of the air force . 
Still , clashes between the army and the Republican Guard are further eroding the regime &apos;s coherence . 
Like other dictators in their political death throes - former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libya &apos;s Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi , for example - Saleh has warned of the dangers the world would face if he is forced to depart : the Muslim Brotherhood , al-Qaeda attacks , Iranian regional hegemony , and the breakup of Yemen.Après moi le déluge seems to be the sole justification he can offer for his continued rule . 
His desperation mounting , Saleh has ordered deadly attacks on protesters , evidently believing that his considerable skill at political manipulation would see him through . 
But , when he declared a state of emergency on March 23 , the number of protesters in the streets doubled . 
Given his regime &apos;s obvious lack of legitimacy , Saleh is playing a dangerous game ; the sooner he leaves , the better for Yemen &apos;s stability and security . 
Indeed , all Yemenis - Houthis , Harak , and even al-Hashids - appear united in their opposition to Saleh &apos;s ailing regime and in their quest for civil and human rights . 
Members of hundreds of tribes have erected tents in &quot; Change Square &quot; in Sanaa . 
Perhaps more remarkably , in a country containing more than 12 million guns , the protesters have not fired a shot . 
Then , on the eve of the Yemeni opposition &apos;s planned &quot; Friday of Departure &quot; protests in late March , the United States resuscitated Saleh &apos;s rule . 
Defense Secretary Robert Gates declared that , &quot; the fall of Saleh would pose a real problem for US counterterrorism work . &quot; 
Saleh , emboldened by Gates &quot; remarks , immediately appeared on television and ordered all opponents to leave Yemen , as if millions of Yemenis would simply desert the country , leaving him and his family to reside in peace . 
Since 2009 , the US has showered Saleh &apos;s government with military aid . 
But the US knows that al-Qaeda is an enemy of convenience for Saleh , and that the danger to the US from post-Saleh chaos in Yemen is exaggerated . 
Democracy does not coexist with al-Qaeda . 
On the contrary , the rising threat of radicalization stems from delaying Saleh &apos;s departure . 
America &apos;s credibility , already low in Yemen , has hit rock bottom ; its leaders &quot; words are no longer taken at face value . 
The gap between US rhetoric and policies has widened . 
The Obama administration relied on the language of human rights in Libya , but it was content to ignore the democratic demands of millions of Yemenis . 
The reality is that the US has known for weeks that it cannot save Saleh &apos;s regime . 
Its concern for Saleh &apos;s political survival is closely linked to its guardianship of the Saudi regime , which fears that ferment in Yemen could give Saudi Arabia &apos;s own Shia , Zaidi , and Ismaili populations dangerous ideas about democratic reform , if not threaten the very existence of the Saudi state . 
After all , Saudi Arabia &apos;s southern tribes and Yemen &apos;s northern tribes are historically the same people , while the Shia in the Kingdom &apos;s oil-rich Eastern Province are protesting in political harmony with the Shia of Bahrain . 
Not surprisingly , Saleh tried to reach for the familiar Saudi lifeline , sending his foreign minister to Riyadh to plead for the sort of help the Saudi king provided to Bahrain . 
But the Saudis , having backed Saleh financially , and having sent troops to Yemen in 2009 to help him wage war against the Houthis , now consider him beyond saving . 
Instead , they are betting on potential new alliances within Yemen to deal with their unpredictable neighbor . 
Finally , the US now appears to have concluded that Saleh &apos;s regime cannot be revived . 
The most compassionate measure that the US , and Saudi Arabia , should take is a form of political euthanasia . 
A young Yemeni protester put this case succinctly : &quot; America , stop administering life support to Saleh and deal with us directly . 
Yemen is the Yemeni people . 
We are Yemen . 
Saleh is only your crony . &quot;
