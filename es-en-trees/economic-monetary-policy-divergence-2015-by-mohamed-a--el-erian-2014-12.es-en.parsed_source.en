A Year of Divergence 
LAGUNA BEACH - In the coming year , &quot; divergence &quot; will be a major global economic theme , applying to economic trends , policies , and performance . 
As the year progresses , these divergences will become increasingly difficult to reconcile , leaving policymakers with a choice : overcome the obstacles that have so far impeded effective action , or risk allowing their economies to be destabilized . 
The multi-speed global economy will be dominated by four groups of countries . 
The first , led by the United States , will experience continued improvement in economic performance . 
Their labor markets will become stronger , with job creation accompanied by wage recovery . 
The benefits of economic growth will be less unequally distributed than in the past few years , though they will still accrue disproportionately to those who are already better off . 
The second group , led by China , will stabilize at lower growth rates than recent historical averages , while continuing to mature structurally . 
They will gradually reorient their growth models to make them more sustainable - an effort that occasional bouts of global financial-market instability will shake , but not derail . 
The third group , led by Europe , will struggle , as continued economic stagnation fuels social and political disenchantment in some countries and complicates regional policy decisions . 
Anemic growth , deflationary forces , and pockets of excessive indebtedness will hamper investment , tilting the balance of risk to the downside . 
In the most challenged economies , unemployment , particularly among young people , will remain alarmingly high and persistent . 
The final group comprises the &quot; wild card &quot; countries , whose size and connectivity have important systemic implications . 
The most notable example is Russia . 
Faced with a deepening economic recession , a collapsing currency , capital flight , and shortages caused by contracting imports , President Vladimir Putin will need to decide whether to change his approach to Ukraine , re-engage with the West to allow for the lifting of sanctions , and build a more sustainable , diversified economy . 
The alternative would be to attempt to divert popular discontent at home by expanding Russia &apos;s intervention in Ukraine . 
This approach would most likely result in a new round of sanctions and counter-sanctions , tipping Russia into an even deeper recession - and perhaps even triggering political instability or more foreign-policy risk-taking - while exacerbating Europe &apos;s economic malaise . 
Brazil is the other notable wild card . 
President Dilma Rousseff , chastened by her near loss in the recent presidential election , has signaled a willingness to improve macroeconomic management , including by resisting a relapse into statism , the potential benefits of which now pale in comparison to its collateral damage and unintended consequences . 
If she delivers , Brazil would join Mexico in anchoring a more stable Latin America in 2015 , helping the region to overcome the disruptive effects of a Venezuelan economy roiled by lower oil prices . 
This multi-speed economic performance will contribute to multi-track central banking , as pressure for divergent monetary policies intensifies , particularly in the systemically important advanced economies . 
The US Federal Reserve , having already stopped its large-scale purchases of long-term assets , is likely to begin hiking interest rates in the third quarter of 2015 . 
By contrast , the European Central Bank will pursue its own version of quantitative easing , introducing in the first quarter of the year a set of new measures to expand its balance sheet . 
The Bank of Japan will maintain its pedal-to-the-metal approach to monetary stimulus . 
Of course , there is no theoretical limit on divergence . 
The problem is that exchange-rate shifts now represent the only mechanism for reconciliation , and the divide between certain market valuations and their fundamentals has become so large that prices are vulnerable to bouts of volatility . 
For the US , the combination of a stronger economy and less accommodative monetary policy will put additional upward pressure on the dollar &apos;s exchange rate - which has already appreciated significantly - against both the euro and the yen . 
With few other countries willing to allow their currencies to strengthen , the dollar &apos;s tendency toward appreciation will remain strong and broad-based , potentially triggering domestic political opposition . 
Moreover , as it becomes increasingly difficult for currency markets to perform the role of orderly reconcilers , friction may arise among countries . 
Fortunately , there are ways to ensure that 2015 &quot; s divergences do not lead to economic and financial disruptions . 
Indeed , most governments - particularly in Europe , Japan , and the US - have the tools they need to defuse the rising tensions and , in the process , unleash their economies &quot; productive potential . 
Avoiding the disruptive potential of divergence is not a question of policy design ; there is already broad , albeit not universal , agreement among economists about the measures that are needed at the national , regional , and global levels . 
Rather , it a question of implementation - and getting that right requires significant and sustained political will . 
The pressure on policymakers to address the risks of divergence will increase next year . 
The consequences of inaction will extend well beyond 2015 .
