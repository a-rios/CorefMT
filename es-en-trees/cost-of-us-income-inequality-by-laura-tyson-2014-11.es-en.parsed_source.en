The Rising Costs of US Income Inequality 
BERKELEY - During the last several decades , income inequality in the United States has increased significantly - and the trend shows no sign of reversing . 
The last time inequality was as high as it is now was just before the Great Depression . 
Such a high level of inequality is not only incompatible with widely held norms of social justice and equality of opportunity ; it poses a serious threat to America &apos;s economy and democracy . 
Underlying the country &apos;s soaring inequality is income stagnation for the majority of Americans . 
With an expanding share of the gains from economic growth flowing to a tiny fraction of high-income US households , average family income for the bottom 90 % has been flat since 1980 . 
According to a recent report by the Council of Economic Advisers , if the share of income going to the bottom 90 % was the same in 2013 as it was in 1973 , median annual household income ( adjusted for family size ) would be 18 % , or about $ 9,000 , higher than it is now . 
The disposable ( after tax and transfer ) incomes of poor families in the US have trailed those of their counterparts in other developed countries for decades . 
Now the US middle class is also falling behind . 
During the last three decades , middle-income households in most developed countries enjoyed larger increases in disposable income than comparable US households . 
Once the generous public benefits in education , health care , and retirement are added to estimates of disposable family income in these countries , the relative position of the US middle class slips even further . 
The main culprit behind the languishing fortunes of America &apos;s middle class is slow wage growth . 
After peaking in the early 1970s , real ( inflation-adjusted ) median earnings of full-time workers aged 25-64 stagnated , partly owing to a slowdown in productivity growth and partly because of a yawning gap between productivity and wage growth . 
Since 1980 , average real hourly compensation has increased at an annual rate of 1 % , or half the rate of productivity growth . 
Wage gains have also become considerably more unequal , with the biggest increases claimed by the top 10 % of earners . 
Moreover , technological change and globalization have reduced the share of middle-skill jobs in overall employment , while the share of lower-skill jobs has increased . 
These trends , along with a falling labor-force participation rate during the last decade , explain the stagnation of middle-class incomes . 
For most Americans , wages are the primary source of disposable income , which in turn drives personal consumption spending - by far the largest component of aggregate demand . 
Over the past several decades , as growth in disposable income slowed , middle- and lower-income households turned to debt to sustain consumption . 
Personal savings rates collapsed , and credit and mortgage debt soared , as households attempted to keep pace with the consumption norms of the wealthy . 
For quite some time , growing income inequality did not slow consumption growth ; indeed , &quot; trickle-down consumption &quot; pressures fostered more consumer spending , more debt , more bankruptcy , and more financial stress among middle- and lower-income households . 
The moment of reckoning arrived with the 2007-2008 financial crisis . 
Since then , aggregate consumption growth has been lackluster , as middle- and lower-income families have been forced to reduce their borrowing and pay down their debt , often through painful defaults on their homes - their primary ( and often their only ) asset . 
As these families have tightened their belts , the pace of consumption spending and economic growth has become more dependent on earners at the top of the income distribution . 
Since the recession ended in 2009 , real consumption spending by the top 5 % has increased by 17 % , compared to just 1 % for the bottom 95 % . 
The recovery &apos;s pattern has reinforced longer-run trends . 
In 2012 , the top 5 % of earners accounted for 38 % of personal-consumption expenditure , compared to 27 % in 1995 . 
During that period , the consumption share for the bottom 80 % of earners dropped from 47 % to 39 % . 
Looking to the future , growing income inequality and stagnant incomes for the majority of Americans mean weaker aggregate demand and slower growth . 
Even more important , income inequality constrains economic growth on the supply side through its adverse effects on educational opportunity and human-capital development . 
Children born into low- and high-income families are born with similar abilities . 
The resulting educational-attainment gap between children born into low and high-income families emerges at an early age and grows over time . 
By some estimates , the gap today is twice as large as it was two decades ago . 
So the US is caught in a vicious circle : rising income inequality breeds more inequality in educational opportunity , which generates greater inequality in educational attainment . 
Although the economic costs of income inequality are substantial , the political costs may prove to be the most damaging and dangerous . 
The rich have both the incentives and the ability to promote policies that maintain or enhance their position . 
Given the US Supreme Court &apos;s evisceration of campaign-finance restrictions , it has become easier than ever for concentrated economic power to exercise concentrated political power . 
Though campaign contributions do not guarantee victory , they give the economic elite greater access to legislators , regulators , and other public officials , enabling them to shape the political debate in favor of their interests . 
As a result , the US political system is increasingly dominated by money . 
This is a clear sign that income inequality in the US has risen to levels that threaten not only the economy &apos;s growth , but also the health of its democracy .
