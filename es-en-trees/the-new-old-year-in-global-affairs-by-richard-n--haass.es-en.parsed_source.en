The New Old Year 
NEW YORK - Any look back at 2012 would necessarily focus on three parts of the world : the eurozone , with its seemingly endless financial uncertainties ; the Middle East , with its many upheavals , including , but hardly limited to , the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s accession to power in Egypt and Syria &apos;s savage civil war , which has already claimed more than 60,000 lives ; and the Asia-Pacific region , with its rising nationalism and political tensions after decades of being defined almost exclusively by extraordinary economic growth amid considerable political calm . 
But which issues will dominate 2013 ? 
In no small part , as the French are fond of saying , plus ça change , plus c &apos;est la même chose . 
Thus , we can safely predict ongoing difficulty throughout Europe , as the countries of the south , in particular , struggle to reduce public spending in order to align their fiscal policies with actual economic capacity . 
What might be different this year is that France , rather than Greece and Spain , could well be at the center of the storm . 
This would pose fundamental , even existential questions for Germany , the other half of a tandem that has been at the heart of the European project since World War II . 
The likelihood that Europe as a whole will experience little , if any , economic growth will make matters all the more difficult for officials in governments , banks , and regional institutions . 
Likewise , the Middle East remains in the early phase of a revolutionary transition . 
In a year , Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi will almost certainly still be in power , but it is not so clear how he will use that power - and what Egypt will look like politically and economically as a result . 
Recent disagreements over the drafting of a new constitution reveal a deeply divided society and a government that appears to equate ( and confuse ) majority rule with democracy . 
By contrast , Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime is likely to have been ousted before the year &apos;s end . 
But , as we have seen elsewhere in the region , it will prove far more difficult to put something benign and effective in its place . 
Civil war along sectarian lines could well predominate , or fighting between the various anti-Assad opposition groups could erupt . 
There is also a real possibility of major upheavals in both Bahrain and Jordan . 
Finally , the friction in the Asia-Pacific region is unlikely to diminish ; in fact , it is far more likely to intensify . 
The chance of a military incident involving China and one of its neighbors - be it Japan , the Philippines , or Vietnam - cannot be ignored , and it remains to be seen whether the region &apos;s diplomatic circuits can carry the load . 
New leadership in many of the region &apos;s countries , including China , Japan , and South Korea , make the future even more uncertain . 
What else can we expect in the 2013 ? 
One disappointing probability is that global efforts to fashion new arrangements to promote trade , slow the pace of climate change , or regulate cyberspace are likely to come to naught . 
Large-scale multilateralism , in which most of the world &apos;s 193 United Nations-recognized countries meet to negotiate accords , has become too unwieldy . 
Instead , the most we can hope for are small accords among select governments or accords that tackle only a part of much larger problems . 
The biggest challenge for the world may well be what to do about Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
Iran has put into place much of what is needed to produce nuclear weapons . 
There are signs of a growing debate inside the country about whether to press ahead with nuclear weapons - and thus risk not only economic ruin , but also military attack - rather than to accept a diplomatic compromise . 
The main question this year is thus likely to be whether an outcome can be negotiated that is enough for Iran but not too much for the United States , Israel , and others . 
What is certain , however , is that 2013 will be defined in a fundamental way by whether military action against Iran occurs or is averted . 
One more country needs to be added to the list of &quot; unpredictables &quot; : the US . 
The question here is whether the American political system can meet the challenges that it faces , many of which it has aggravated . 
The US remains the greatest economic and military power in the world , but questions about its solvency have in turn cast doubt on its ability to act and lead in the world . 
Recent events in Washington have been less than reassuring . 
Global developments not just in the year ahead , but also during the next decade and beyond , will depend in large part on whether the US can better manage its domestic challenges and divisions .
