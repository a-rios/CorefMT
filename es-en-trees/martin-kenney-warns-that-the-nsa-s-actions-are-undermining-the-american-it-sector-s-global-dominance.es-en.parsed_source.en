Silicon Valley &apos;s Spy Problem 
DAVIS , CALIFORNIA - In a recent letter to US President Barack Obama , the CEO of Cisco Systems , John Chambers , requested that the National Security Agency stop intercepting the company &apos;s products to install devices for spying on foreign customers . 
This is the latest in a series of revelations of how US information-technology firms have been enlisted , knowingly or otherwise , in the &quot; war on terror &quot; - revelations that are threatening the American IT sector &apos;s global dominance . 
Since the scale of the NSA &apos;s Internet eavesdropping came to light , governments and large companies outside of the United States are questioning the capacity of American IT firms to guarantee their products &quot; security . 
America &apos;s central position in the world &apos;s information economy , which seemed secure just two years ago , is now under threat - a fact that should raise serious concerns for every entrepreneur , executive , employee , and venture capitalist in the American industry . 
There is more than a little irony in this turn of events . 
America &apos;s global IT leadership , after all , can be traced directly to its national security apparatus . 
Following World War II , and especially after the Soviet Union &apos;s launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 , the US made massive investments in electrical engineering and , later , computer science . 
Cost-plus contracting allowed what were then small technology firms like Hewlett-Packard and Fairchild Semiconductor to charge the Department of Defense for the price of research and development that none could pay on its own . 
This enabled the firms to create technology products that eventually created entire new markets and economic sectors . 
The US government also made massive , continuous investments in university-based research , boosting the country &apos;s supply of engineers and scientists . 
These highly trained people created countless new technologies , including computer graphics , semiconductors , networking equipment , groundbreaking software , and the Internet itself . 
In fact , the US government remains a critical supporter of scientific and engineering research to this day . 
In 2012 , the defense department invested $ 1.3 billion in electrical engineering and computer science alone , while the National Science Foundation invested another $ 900 million . 
The US military has provided a particularly large amount of funding to university researchers in computer security and encryption . 
With so many of America &apos;s top entrepreneurs , executives , and researchers having received support from the defense department , it is no surprise that Google &apos;s founders and executives , for example , have exchanged friendly emails with NSA officials . 
Professional and personal connections made recruiting corporate leaders to the anti-terror war relatively easy . 
Few , it seems , considered the potential consequences of their participation . 
The resulting relationship between Silicon Valley and Washington , DC , is remarkable for its longevity and depth . 
For example , the database software giant Oracle has been rumored to maintain close ties with the CIA . 
Similarly , the partly CIA-funded Keyhole , Inc . , was among the acquisitions that produced Google Maps . 
The CIA &apos;s Silicon Valley venture-capital operation , In-Q-Tel is meant to ensure that the interests of America &apos;s national security apparatus are implanted in technology startups . 
The consequence of these ties is that America &apos;s IT industry has become an agent of the national security state . 
This undermines consumers &quot; faith in firms &quot; willingness or ability to guarantee their privacy , while making it difficult for companies to claim the moral high ground when , say , China &apos;s government restricts their domestic operations . 
Given that America &apos;s IT sector is so far ahead globally , the impact of these perceptions will remain largely localized in the short term . 
But , as European and Asian IT firms catch up , America &apos;s advantage will gradually deteriorate . 
Foreign customers &quot; search for alternatives is underway in both existing and emerging industries . 
For example , Oracle is experiencing a slowdown in the Asia-Pacific region , where its main competitor , the German company SAP , is thriving . 
And the competition that Cisco faces from Huawei of China is what likely drove Chambers &quot; recent appeal to Obama . 
In one of the newest IT fields , cloud computing , where US firms are pioneers , firms and entrepreneurs in many countries are exploring the creation of non-US alternatives . 
Preventing this self-inflicted threat to America &apos;s IT preeminence will require strong action by US political leaders , who are responsible for this dangerous trend . 
First and foremost , Obama , with support from Congress , must demand the release of all information regarding interactions between national security agencies and American IT firms . 
Furthermore , corporations and privacy advocates should be encouraged to use the court system to challenge government requests to install spy software in commercial products . 
If the government &apos;s agents break privacy laws , at home or abroad , the Department of Justice should prosecute them to the full extent of the law . 
Given how extensively the NSA &apos;s activities have degraded global trust in America &apos;s government and IT sector , nothing less than complete transparency is required . 
It is time for US leaders to place the well-being of the high-tech wealth machine - which cost US taxpayers tens of billions of dollars to build - above the illusory notion that the only route to safety is unfettered access to the world &apos;s digital traffic .
