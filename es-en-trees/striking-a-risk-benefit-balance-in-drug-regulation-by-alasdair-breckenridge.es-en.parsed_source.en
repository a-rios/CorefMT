Life-Saving Killer Drugs 
LONDON - The harmful effects of medicines capture headlines worldwide . 
After all , horror stories about &quot; killer drugs &quot; are easy to sell . 
But , while drugs &quot; damaging effects are a legitimate cause for concern , they do not necessarily constitute a serious public-health issue , provided that they are outweighed by the benefits they confer . 
Drugs with serious adverse safety profiles are used to treat potentially fatal conditions - including various forms of cancer , inflammatory arthritis , and HIV - because they ultimately help more than they hurt . 
Rather than assess a medicine &apos;s safety in isolation , its adverse effects must be considered in relation to its efficacy . 
In other words , a benefit-risk balance must be struck . 
But getting this message across to the public has proven to be difficult . 
Successful drug treatment and disease prevention can fail to capture the attention of readers or voters . 
Moreover , drug safety is a leading factor in determining how medicines are regulated . 
In 1961 , thalidomide , a hypnotic drug also used to treat nausea in pregnant women , was found to have caused severe birth defects in more than 10,000 children in 46 countries since its introduction four years earlier . 
In the tragedy &apos;s wake , drug-development processes were adjusted in order to bolster medicines &quot; safety profile . 
As a result , many of the most widely prescribed drugs today were subject to a long process of preclinical experimentation , followed by clinical studies that lasted several years and cost millions of dollars , before gaining regulators &quot; approval . 
But this development model is no longer sustainable . 
Not only is it expensive and slow , but it also has been unproductive . 
Since 2001-2002 , the pharmaceutical sector has spent $ 1.1 trillion on research and development , but the 12 largest companies have received regulatory approval for only 139 new molecular compounds . 
But things are changing . 
Such drugs have the realistic potential to cure forms of cancer and autoimmune diseases rather than merely treat the symptoms of disease . 
This poses a dilemma , because regulators are concerned about the lack of safety information about these new drugs . 
But that concern might be as unnecessary as it is inhibiting . 
Patients with serious conditions can gain early access to promising drugs before they are fully licensed . 
The adaptive licensing model thus recasts drug licensing as a more fluid process , based on the benefit-risk ratio . 
Rather than determining simply whether the drug is effective or has unwanted side-effects , it aims to appraise the benefits and risks in view of the patient &apos;s specific needs . 
The price of medicines has become increasingly important as the cost of developing new medicines such as biopharmaceuticals has risen . 
In the United Kingdom , a biologically-based drug costs , on average , £ 9,500 ( $ 15,200 ) per patient annually , compared to £ 450 for conventional drug treatment . 
Given the substantial discrepancy , cash-strapped health-care payers must assess whether the new generation of medicines represents value for money . 
As a result , drug developers are increasingly aware that surmounting the regulatory hurdle is no longer enough ; they must also satisfy the payer , who in effect has become a second gatekeeper to patients &quot; access to new medicines . 
A related issue is the advent of what is known as personalized medicine . 
Increasing knowledge of genetics is producing a new generation of medicines specifically tailored for individual patients , posing yet another new challenge to the industry , regulators , and payers . 
In short , innovations in medical research demand an updated drug-development process in which the patient is paramount . 
By relying on benefit-risk analysis , rather than on a more rigid , phased approval process , potentially life-saving medications can better reach the patients who need them .
