The &quot; Asset Crisis &quot; of Emerging Economies 
BEIJING - In theory , the difference between capital inflows and outflows in developing countries should be positive - they should be net capital importers , with the magnitude of the balance equivalent to the current-account deficit . 
Since the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis , however , many East Asian countries have been running current-account surpluses - and hence have become net capital exporters . 
Even odder is the fact that while they are net capital exporters , they run financial ( capital ) account surpluses . 
In other words , these countries lend not only the money they earned through current-account surpluses , but also the money they borrowed through capital-account surpluses - mainly to the United States . 
As a result , East Asian countries are now sitting on a huge pile of foreign-exchange reserves in the form of US government securities . 
While China has attracted a large amount of foreign direct investment , it has bought an even larger amount of US government securities . 
Whereas the average return on FDI in China was 33 % for American firms in 2008 , the average return on China &apos;s investment in US government securities was a mere 3-4 % . 
So , why does China invest its savings so heavily in low-return US government securities , rather than in high-return domestic projects ? 
One answer lies in the fact that China &apos;s FDI policy over the past 30 years has crowded out Chinese investors from high-return projects , forcing them to settle for less lucrative projects . 
But there are still potential investors who cannot find any suitable investment opportunities in China , generating excess resources , which in turn are invested in US government securities . 
But , while China &apos;s foreign assets are denominated in US dollars , its liabilities , such as FDI , are mostly denominated in renminbi . 
As a result , when the dollar depreciates against the renminbi , the value of China &apos;s foreign liabilities increases in dollar terms , while that of its foreign assets remains unchanged . 
As a result , China &apos;s net international investment position ( NIIP ) , which is the difference between China &apos;s gross assets and its gross liabilities , automatically worsens . 
The deterioration of China &apos;s NIIP is a reflection of the transfer of wealth from China to the US . 
Since the 2000 &quot; s , China &apos;s gross assets and gross liabilities have increased dramatically , owing to the success of China &apos;s trade-promotion and FDI policies . 
As a result , China &apos;s net international investment position has become very vulnerable to the devaluation of the dollar . 
Meanwhile , capital inflows into developing countries have surged since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis . 
In 2010 , China &apos;s capital-account surplus stood at $ 230 billion , and capital inflows remain large this year . 
With ever-increasing gross dollar assets and gross renminbi liabilities , a stronger renminbi means that China will suffer additional welfare losses from the valuation effect of exchange-rate movements . 
( It is worth noting that this is not solely a Chinese phenomenon ; all major emerging-market economies are faced with the same fate . ) 
During the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis , East Asia &apos;s economies paid heavily for excessive accumulation of dollar-denominated debts . 
Because governments failed to defend their currencies , they lost hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign-exchange reserves to international speculators . 
Whether for self-insurance or to maintain a competitive exchange rate , East Asia has since then accumulated a huge volume of dollar-denominated assets . 
This time around , thanks to the deterioration of the US fiscal position and the Federal Reserve &apos;s expansionary monetary policy , &quot; the long-term risk &#91; for &#93; emerging markets &quot; external balance sheets is shifting , &quot; as Eswar Prasad of the Brookings Institution has pointed out , &quot; to the asset side . &quot; 
Rather than confronting a debt crisis , as in 1997-98 , emerging-market economies now face an &quot; asset crisis , &quot; but they will suffer the same result : great capital losses on their foreign-exchange reserves . 
Indeed , the magnitude of the losses will be on par with that of Asian financial crisis , if not higher . 
While China &apos;s government should make greater efforts to rebalance the economy by conventional measures , it also should focus more attention on adjusting the currency structure of the country &apos;s gross assets and gross liabilities . 
In particular , China should try to replace its dollar-denominated assets with renminbi-denominated assets , and its renminbi-denominated liabilities with dollar-denominated liabilities . 
If China cannot do very much about existing gross assets and gross liabilities , it should address new assets and liabilities in order to minimize future capital losses . 
In short , China must take into consideration the ongoing asset crisis facing emerging economies , especially when considering highly consequential questions such as full renminbi convertibility and the currency &apos;s internationalization .
