Haiti and the Limits of Generosity 
MELBOURNE - All over the world , people have responded generously to the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti . 
In just three days , more than a million Americans had donated $ 10 with the aid of text messages from their cellphones . 
People with very little themselves , like Maria Pacheco , an unemployed single mother from Chicago , donated food and clothes . 
Others did whatever they could - from pedicures to washing cars - to raise money . 
On current indications , the amount Americans will give to relief efforts in Haiti could surpass the $ 1.9 billion they gave to assist victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami , which until now has stood as a record for donations to a disaster outside the United States . 
Given that the US is undergoing economic hard times , the size of the response has surprised many . 
Haiti &quot; s proximity , plus the fact that close to a million Haitians live in the US , goes some way towards explaining why Americans have responded so generously . 
But the response has been worldwide . 
In Melbourne for the Australian Open , Roger Federer , Serena Williams , and other stars held an exhibition match that led to donations of $ 600,000 . 
In Rwanda , a group of community health workers making less than $ 200 a month raised $ 7,000 for Haiti . 
All of this raises many questions about how we respond - and how we should respond - to such tragedies . 
The earthquake killed up to 200,000 people . 
Terrible as that is , it is fewer than the number of children who , according to the United Nations Children &apos;s Fund , UNICEF , die every 10 days from avoidable , poverty-related causes . 
Moreover , as Elie Hassenfeld has argued on GiveWell.net , there are good grounds for thinking that disaster relief is less cost-effective than aid aimed at saving the lives of those who are risk from extreme poverty . 
Why do people give generously to earthquake victims , but not to prevent the much larger number of deaths brought about by extreme poverty , insufficient food , unsafe water , lack of sanitation , and the absence of even the most basic health care ? 
Media saturation obviously makes a critical difference . 
Scenes from Hurricane Katrina , the Asian tsunami , and now the Haitian earthquake were shown over and over again on all television news broadcasts . 
An earthquake in a remote part of Pakistan that killed 80,000 people received relatively little television coverage , and a much less generous response . 
The daily deaths of children in poor countries from diarrhea , measles , and malaria are part of the background of the world we live in , and so are not news at all . 
Suppose that a million children all in one place seemed likely to be swept away and drowned by approaching floodwaters . 
The media coverage would be enormous . 
Now imagine the jubilation if they were saved ! 
And imagine the acclaim for the heroes who had saved so many children . 
Yet when UNICEF announced , in September of last year , that the number of children dying each year from poverty-related causes had dropped by one million , as compared to two years earlier , the story got very little media attention . 
The people who contributed to this drop by delivering effective basic health care , building a supply of safe water , or immunizing children against measles remain largely unknown . 
Perhaps people respond more generously to the victims of natural disasters than they do to those in extreme poverty because , after a natural disaster , we tend not to blame the victims . 
We seem to accept that to be struck by an earthquake , a tidal wave , or a hurricane is just bad luck ( unless , as the American evangelist Pat Robertson suggested after the Haitian earthquake , your ancestors made a pact with the devil in order to free themselves from colonial rule ) . 
Still , many people profess to believe that poverty is the result of not working hard enough , or of having too many children . 
But the circumstances that produce extreme poverty are not , except in rare cases , under the control of such poor people . 
They may be , to some extent , under the control of governments , and undoubtedly bad government is a major contributor to poverty . 
But then , bad government can also contribute to the toll exacted by a natural disaster . 
Two years ago , a team of geophysicists led by Eric Calais of Purdue University predicted that the fault that produced the recent Haitian earthquake was at high risk of doing exactly what it did . 
They urged the Haitian government to take steps to strengthen critical buildings , including hospitals and schools . 
Failure to do so contributed to the toll . 
What should we do ? 
Brian Tucker , founder of the non-profit organization Geohazards International , urges that 10 % of the money raised by relief efforts should be set aside for mitigating damage from future earthquakes : training builders , improving engineering , and making the public more aware of the risks and how to reduce them . 
He claims that every dollar invested in preparing for natural disasters saves ten dollars in future damage . 
Tucker &apos;s proposal makes good sense , but it is difficult - and arguably unethical - for charities that raised money to help Haitians now to divert some of those funds to programs to mitigate the damage caused by future earthquakes . 
It would be excellent if the general public responded to an appeal for funds for mitigating future damage . 
But the prospects of that happening are slim , because such an appeal would lack the emotional pull of the desire to help immediate victims . 
Instead , governments that are pledging aid to Haiti now should ensure that part of their assistance goes to reducing the chances that such a disaster will affect Haiti so dramatically again .
