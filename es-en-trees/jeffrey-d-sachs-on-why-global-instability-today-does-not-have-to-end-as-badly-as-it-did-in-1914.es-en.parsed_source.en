The Waste of War 
NEW YORK - Karl Marx famously wrote that history repeats itself , &quot; the first time as tragedy , the second time as farce . &quot; 
Yet when we look around nowadays , we can &apos;t help but wonder whether tragedy will be followed by yet more tragedy . 
Here we are , at the centenary of the outbreak of World War I , and we find ourselves surrounded by cascading violence , duplicity , and cynicism of the very sort that brought the world to disaster in 1914 . 
And the world regions involved then are involved again . 
WWI began with a mindset , one based on the belief that military means could resolve pressing social and political issues in Central Europe . 
A century earlier , the German military theorist Carl von Clausewitz had written that war is &quot; a continuation of political intercourse carried on with other means . &quot; 
Enough politicians in 1914 agreed . 
Yet WWI proved Clausewitz tragically wrong for modern times . 
War in the industrial age is tragedy , disaster , and devastation ; it solves no political problems . 
WWI ended four imperial regimes : the Prussian ( Hohenzollern ) dynasty , the Russian ( Romanov ) dynasty , the Turkish ( Ottoman ) dynasty , and the Austro-Hungarian ( Habsburg ) dynasty . 
The war not only caused millions of deaths ; it also left a legacy of revolution , state bankruptcy , protectionism , and financial collapse that set the stage for Hitler &apos;s rise , World War II , and the Cold War . 
We are still reeling today . 
Territory that was once within the multi-ethnic , multi-state , multi-religious Ottoman Empire is again engulfed in conflict and war , stretching from Libya to Palestine-Israel , Syria , and Iraq . 
The Balkan region remains sullen and politically divided , with Bosnia and Herzegovina unable to institute an effective central government and Serbia deeply jolted by the 1999 NATO bombing and the contentious independence of Kosovo in 2008 , over its bitter opposition . 
The former Russian Empire is in growing turmoil as well , a kind of delayed reaction to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , with Russia attacking Ukraine and violence continuing to erupt in Georgia , Moldova , and elsewhere . 
In East Asia , tensions between China and Japan - echoes of the last century - are a growing danger . 
As was the case a century ago , vain and ignorant leaders are pushing into battle without clear purpose or realistic prospects for resolution of the underlying political , economic , social , or ecological factors that are creating the tensions in the first place . 
The approach of too many governments is to shoot first , think later . 
Take the US . 
Its basic strategy has been to send troops , drones , or bombers to any place that would threaten America &apos;s access to oil , harbors Islamic fundamentalists , or otherwise creates problems - say , piracy off the coast of Somalia - for US interests . 
Hence , US troops , the CIA , drone missiles , or US-backed armies are engaged in fighting across a region stretching from the Sahel in West Africa , through Libya , Somalia , Yemen , Syria , Iraq , Afghanistan , and beyond . 
All of this military activity costs hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars . 
But , rather than solving a single underlying problem , the chaos is growing , threatening an ever-widening war . 
Russia is not handling itself any better . 
For a while , Russia backed international law , rightly complaining that the US and NATO were violating international law in Kosovo , Iraq , Syria , and Libya . 
But then President Vladimir Putin took aim at Ukraine , fearing that the country was about to drop into Europe &apos;s pocket . 
Suddenly , he was silent about obeying international law . 
His government then illegally annexed Crimea and is fighting an increasingly brutal guerrilla war in eastern Ukraine , through proxies and , it now appears , direct engagement of Russian forces . 
In this context , the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 is terrifying not only for its brutality , but also in its intimation of a world gone mad . 
At the time of this writing , those who aimed and fired the missile remain unknown , though Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine are the most likely culprits . 
What is certain , however , is that the violence unleashed by Putin &apos;s war on Ukraine has claimed hundreds of innocent lives and brought the world a step closer to disaster . 
There are no heroes among the great powers today . 
The US effectively violates international law by resorting to force without United Nations sanction . 
It sends drones and secret forces into sovereign countries without their approval . 
It spies relentlessly on friend and foe alike . 
Russia does the same , inflicting death on Ukraine , Georgia , and other neighbors . 
The only constants in all of this are the easy resort to violence and the lies that inevitably accompany it . 
There are four major differences between now and the world of 1914 . 
For starters , we have since lived through two disastrous wars , a Great Depression , and a Cold War . 
We have had the opportunity to learn a thing or two about the stupidity and uselessness of organized collective violence . 
Second , the next global war , in this nuclear age , would almost surely end the world . 
The third major difference is that today , with our wondrous technologies , we have every opportunity to solve the underlying problems of poverty , hunger , displacement , and environmental degradation that create so many dangerous tinderboxes . 
Finally , we have international law , if we choose to use it . 
The belligerents in Europe and Asia 100 years ago could not turn to the UN Security Council and UN General Assembly , venues where diplomacy , rather than war , can be the true continuation of politics . 
We are blessed with the possibility to construct peace through a global institution that was founded to help ensure that global war would never recur . 
As citizens of the world , our job now is to demand peace through diplomacy , and through global , regional , and national initiatives to address the scourges of poverty , disease , and environmental degradation . 
On this hundredth anniversary of one of the greatest disasters of human history , let us follow tragedy not by farce or more tragedy , but by the triumph of cooperation and decency .
