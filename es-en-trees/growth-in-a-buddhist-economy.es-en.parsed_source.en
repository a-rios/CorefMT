Growth in a Buddhist Economy 
NEW YORK - I have just returned from Bhutan , the Himalayan kingdom of unmatched natural beauty , cultural richness , and inspiring self-reflection . 
From the kingdom &apos;s uniqueness now arises a set of economic and social questions that are of pressing interest for the entire world . 
Bhutan &apos;s rugged geography fostered the rise of a hardy population of farmers and herdsmen , and helped to foster a strong Buddhist culture , closely connected in history with Tibet . 
The population is sparse - roughly 700,000 people on territory the size of France - with agricultural communities nestled in deep valleys and a few herdsmen in the high mountains . 
Each valley is guarded by a dzong ( fortress ) , which includes monasteries and temples , all dating back centuries and exhibiting a masterful combination of sophisticated architecture and fine arts . 
Bhutan &apos;s economy of agriculture and monastic life remained self-sufficient , poor , and isolated until recent decades , when a series of remarkable monarchs began to guide the country toward technological modernization ( roads , power , modern health care , and education ) , international trade ( notably with neighboring India ) , and political democracy . What is incredible is the thoughtfulness with which Bhutan is approaching this process of change , and how Buddhist thinking guides that thoughtfulness . 
Bhutan is asking itself the question that everyone must ask : how can economic modernization be combined with cultural robustness and social well-being ? 
In Bhutan , the economic challenge is not growth in gross national product , but in gross national happiness ( GNH ) . 
I went to Bhutan to understand better how GNH is being applied . 
There is no formula , but , befitting the seriousness of the challenge and Bhutan &apos;s deep tradition of Buddhist reflection , there is an active and important process of national deliberation . 
Therein lies the inspiration for all of us . 
Part of Bhutan &apos;s GNH revolves , of course , around meeting basic needs - improved health care , reduced maternal and child mortality , greater educational attainment , and better infrastructure , especially electricity , water , and sanitation . 
This focus on material improvement aimed at meeting basic needs makes sense for a country at Bhutan &apos;s relatively low income level . 
Yet GNH goes well beyond broad-based , pro-poor growth . 
Bhutan is also asking how economic growth can be combined with environmental sustainability - a question that it has answered in part through a massive effort to protect the country &apos;s vast forest cover and its unique biodiversity . 
It is asking how it can preserve its traditional equality and foster its unique cultural heritage . 
I came to Bhutan after hearing an inspiring speech by Prime Minister Jigme Thinley at the 2010 Delhi Summit on Sustainable Development . 
Thinley had made two compelling points . 
The first concerned the environmental devastation that he could observe - including the retreat of glaciers and the loss of land cover - as he flew from Bhutan to India . 
The second was about the individual and the meaning of happiness . 
Thinley put it simply : We are each finite and fragile physical beings . 
How much &quot; stuff &quot; - fast foods , TV commercials , large cars , new gadgets , and latest fashions - can we stuff into ourselves without deranging our own psychological well-being ? 
For the world &apos;s poorest countries , such questions are not the most pressing . 
Their biggest and most compelling challenge is to meet citizens &quot; basic needs . 
But , for more and more countries , Thinley &apos;s reflection on the ultimate sources of well-being is not only timely , but urgent . 
Everybody knows how American-style hyper-consumerism can destabilize social relations and lead to aggressiveness , loneliness , greed , and over-work to the point of exhaustion . 
What is perhaps less recognized is how those trends have accelerated in the United States itself in recent decades . 
This may be the result of , among other things , the increasing and now relentless onslaught of advertising and public relations . 
The question of how to guide an economy to produce sustainable happiness - combining material well-being with human health , environmental conservation , and psychological and cultural resiliency - is one that needs addressing everywhere . 
Bhutan has many things going its way . 
It will be able to increase exports of clean , run-of-the-river hydropower to India , thereby earning foreign exchange in a manner that is sustainable and that can fill government coffers to fund education , health care , and infrastructure . 
The country is also intent on ensuring that the benefits of growth reach all of the population , regardless of region or income level . 
There are serious risks . 
Global climate change threatens Bhutan &apos;s ecology and economy . 
Incautious and expensive advice from McKinsey and other private consulting firms could help turn Bhutan into a degraded tourist zone . 
One must hope that the quest for GNH will help steer the country away from such temptations . 
The key for Bhutan is to regard GNH as an enduring quest , rather than as a simple checklist . 
Bhutan &apos;s Buddhist tradition understands happiness not as attachment to goods and services , but as the result of the serious work of inner reflection and compassion toward others . 
Bhutan has embarked on such a serious journey . 
The rest of the world &apos;s economies should do the same .
