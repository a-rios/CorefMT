America &apos;s Reactionary Feminists 
NEW YORK - It is obvious that the left and the media establishment in the United States cannot fully understand the popular appeal of the two Republican tigresses in the news - first Sarah Palin , and now , as she consolidates her status as a Republican presidential front-runner , Michele Bachmann . 
What do they have that other candidates don &apos;t - and that so many Americans seem to want ? 
Both Bachmann and Palin are regularly derided in the mainstream press . 
In Palin &apos;s case , the dominant perception is that she is an intellectual lightweight : a clip of her unable to mention a single newspaper or news magazine that she reads regularly got millions of hits on YouTube during the last presidential election . 
Bachmann , on the other hand , is portrayed as being slightly unhinged . 
Indeed , I can attest from personal experience that to debate her is to encounter someone who is absolutely certain of facts that must exist somewhere in a parallel universe . 
But it would be a mistake simply to dismiss their appeal with no effort to comprehend its source . 
Palin has not managed to secure the support and mentorship of the Republican Party establishment , and will continue to showcase her odd appeal as a media personality . 
The nature of their attraction has to do with two strains in American thought to which the US left and media establishment are truly blind . 
One is the American tradition of populist demagoguery - a tradition that , in the twentieth century , included the racist Father Charles Coughlin in the 1930 &quot; s , the anti-Communist witch-hunter Joe McCarthy in the 1950 &quot; s , and the radical Malcolm X in the 1960 &quot; s . 
Populist leaders inspire passionate devotion , usually in people who feel ( and often are ) economically , politically , and culturally marginalized . 
These populist movements &quot; energy can be directed for good or ill , but demagogues in America embrace similar tactics to fuel their rise to visibility and power . 
They use emotive rhetoric . 
They often invent shadowy networks of &quot; elite &quot; forces ranged against the ordinary , decent American . 
They create an &quot; us versus them &quot; scenario . 
Palin and Bachmann speak this highly personal or emotional language , which even the most rock-ribbed male Republican finds difficult to emulate . 
In the last three decades , America &apos;s male-dominated politics has become increasingly wonky , abstract , and professionalized . 
As a result , Palin is free to talk about &quot; death panels &quot; - a wholly invented threat of President Barack Obama &apos;s health-care reform - and Bachmann can summon the spirit of McCarthy to raise the equally bizarre specter of socialism &apos;s tentacles infiltrating the highest levels of government . 
Both can issue homespun appeals as &quot; hockey moms &quot; or &quot; soccer moms &quot; - precisely the type of emotionalism that more cut-and-dried professional male politicians , even ( or especially ) at the top of the party , cannot manage to deliver . 
The second reason that Bachmann and Palin appeal to so many Americans - and this should not be underestimated , either - has to do with a serious historical misreading of feminism . 
Because feminism in the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s was articulated via the institutions of the left - in Britain , it was often allied with the labor movement , and in America , it was reborn in conjunction with the emergence of the New Left - there is an assumption that feminism itself must be leftist . 
In fact , feminism is philosophically as much in harmony with conservative , and especially libertarian , values - and in some ways even more so . 
The core of feminism is individual choice and freedom , and it is these strains that are being sounded now more by the Tea Party movement than by the left . 
They prefer what they see as the rugged individualism of free-market forces , a level capitalist playing field , and a weak state that does not impinge on their personal choices . 
Many of these women are socially conservative , strongly supportive of the armed forces , and religious - and yet they crave equality as strongly as any leftist vegetarian in Birkenstocks . 
It is blindness to this perfectly legitimate approach to feminism that keeps tripping up commentators who wish to dismiss women like Margaret Thatcher , or Muslim women , or now right-wing US women leaders , as somehow not being the &quot; real thing . &quot; 
But these women are real feminists - even if they do not share policy preferences with the already recognized &quot; sisterhood , &quot; and even if they themselves would reject the feminist label . 
In the case of Palin - and especially that of Bachmann - we ignore the wide appeal of right-wing feminism at our peril .
