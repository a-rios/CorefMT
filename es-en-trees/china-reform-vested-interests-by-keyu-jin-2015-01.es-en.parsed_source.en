China &apos;s Reform Stalemate 
BEIJING - China &apos;s reform program has reached an impasse , with fundamental conflicts of interest and subtle resistance mechanisms blocking progress . 
Until these barriers are removed , there is little hope that China &apos;s slowing economy - which grew by 7.4 % in 2014 , its lowest rate in nearly a quarter-century - can rely on reform to give it the push it needs . 
Chinese leaders are well acquainted with how difficult it can be to implement drastic reforms . 
When Deng Xiaoping launched his radical program of &quot; reform and opening up &quot; in 1978 , he faced fierce opposition - mostly from fervent ideologues and revolutionary diehards . 
Just as Deng &apos;s status and forcefulness enabled him to face down his opponents and keep China &apos;s economic modernization on course , President Xi Jinping &apos;s determined leadership can overcome vested interests and implement the needed reforms . 
Of course , reconciling the fundamental misalignment of interests in China will not be easy - not least because interest groups will not discuss , much less oppose , reforms in an open and transparent manner . 
Only small concessions have been made to scaling back government intervention , affecting powers that are either irrelevant or never actually existed . 
There are two types of conflicts of interest among the government bodies . 
First , China &apos;s powerful bureaucracy is disinclined to cede its powers in the name of liberalization and a shift toward a more market-oriented economy . 
For example , the Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council ( SASAC ) is the ministry-level government institution responsible for state-owned enterprises . 
Its task now includes eliminating the SOEs &quot; monopoly power , which is hampering market competition . 
But reducing the SOEs &quot; power would also mean a diminished role for SASAC - and , most likely , its eventual obsolescence . 
As a result , efforts to fight monopoly are lagging , and the next stage of reform - the transition to a &quot; blended ownership system &quot; - remains distant . 
Similarly , the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( SAFE ) , the subsidiary of the People &apos;s Bank of China that controls the foreign-exchange transactions of commercial banks and households , derives its power from controlling capital inflows and outflows . 
Recognizing that progress toward capital-account liberalization would imply its eventual demise , SAFE has made numerous excuses ( to which the recent financial crises in the West have lent credence ) for retaining tight control over foreign-exchange transactions . 
So , despite the government &apos;s stated commitment to liberalize the capital account , the PBOC has yet to make observable progress . 
The second major conflict of interest in China is between the central and local governments , which are supposed to be adjusting their revenue-sharing model . 
The problem lies in a mismatch between their respective shares of tax revenues and mandatory expenditures . 
With local governments forced to cover a large proportion of public spending with a disproportionately low share of revenues , local-government debt has swelled . 
But the central government remains reluctant to make significant changes to the revenue-sharing model , wary not only of the effects on its coffers , but also of conferring more authority on local officials . 
Moreover , they doubt local governments &quot; ability to manage their budgets properly and to use the additional tax revenues efficiently . 
The fundamental contradiction , as these examples show , is between the goals of the reform process and the incentives that underpin them . 
Nowhere is this clearer than in the &quot; mixed ownership system &quot; envisaged by the Third Plenary of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China . 
Encouraging the private sector to take stakes in SOEs in strategic areas like energy , power , and finance is supposed to increase competition , boost efficiency , and reduce pressure on the government to invest . 
But why should private investors put their money in SOEs ? 
As minority shareholders in firms whose managers are appointed by the Central Personnel Ministry , private actors cannot influence decision-making . 
Until the central government is willing to yield its control over SOE management , ownership reforms are likely to spark only tepid interest from the private sector . 
If implemented fully , the current round of reforms would have a far-reaching impact on China &apos;s political economy , because they shift the balance of power from officials to markets . 
This would enable China to continue its ascent toward high-income status , improving the wellbeing of millions of its citizens along the way . 
But vested interests will not back down . 
Though they will not oppose reforms outright , they will continue to procrastinate and spread fear about economic instability and social tension to prevent changes that threaten to diminish their status and prerogatives . 
Unless and until China &apos;s top leaders overcome such resistance , progress on reform will remain sluggish .
