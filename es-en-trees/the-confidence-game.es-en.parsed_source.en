The Confidence Game 
Confidence is a vital element of life , for nations and civilizations as much as for individuals . 
Confidence is the ingredient of hope . 
It allows you to project yourself into the future , to fulfill or even transcend your capabilities . 
It comes from within , but can be reinforced or weakened by the way others perceive you . 
But confidence , like blood pressure , must be balanced : the problem starts when you have too much or too little of it . 
Overconfidence tends to be as destabilizing as a lack of it . 
Consider , for example , America in Iraq . 
The Bush administration &apos;s overconfidence in the validity of its objectives - democratizing the Middle East - much more than implementation failures , was the key factor behind the unfolding catastrophe there . 
I recently debated one of the key thinkers behind the decision to &quot; liberate &quot; Iraq from Saddam Hussein . 
A prominent neo-conservative , he seemed to me something of a Bolshevik of democracy , owing to his unshakeable confidence in the validity of his vision . 
According to him , the status quo in the Middle East was untenable and dangerous . 
Democracy in Iraq would not only bring peace in Jerusalem , but also a new , safer , and better equilibrium in the entire Arab world . 
Because the United States is the most powerful and wisest of nations , it has a unique role to play , and the world should rally behind it in courageously tackling this challenge . 
In other words , even as late as the early summer of 2007 , he was , like the Bush administration , in a state of denial . 
For him , things were going well in Iraq , and a new balance of forces was being established - one that would benefit Iraq &apos;s Shia majority , but not necessarily Iran . 
The courage and audacity of the US government and its army was finally &quot; paying off . &quot; 
Daily violence should not be allowed to hide deeper strategic realities : victory was around the corner , and soon , the world - despite all the anti-Bush propaganda - would recognize it . 
At such a level , overconfidence is generally the product of an excessive assessment of one &apos;s capabilities and an insufficient appreciation of the capabilities of one &apos;s adversary . 
Both are the product of an ideological reading of the world that bears little connection with reality . 
In invading Russia in 1941 , Hitler , like Napoleon , demonstrated a military overconfidence that resulted in catastrophe . 
Saddam himself fatally overplayed his cards , convinced as he was that America would not dare to attack him . 
At the same time , lack of confidence on the part of a country , a culture , or a civilization can be just as dangerous . 
The deep conviction that reform can only lead to revolution and chaos results in a stultification of reality that can lead to immobility and despair - and thus become a dangerous and self-fulfilling prophecy . 
For example , in Egypt , which is highly representative of the prevailing political situation in the Middle East , the status quo is the result of the regime &apos;s absolute lack of confidence in its ability to open up and reform . 
This same lack of confidence is behind the potentially explosive situations in Algeria , Tunisia , and even Morocco . 
Because their legitimacy does not rest upon the support of their people , these non-democratic regimes consider the risk of opening themselves greater than the cost of maintaining the status quo . 
Of course , confidence and self-doubt are not mutually exclusive . 
A country like Israel booms with economic confidence , but is full of self-doubt when it comes to strategic and political considerations . 
Can the right amount of confidence be instilled in countries or groups that badly need it ? 
And if overconfidence is so dangerous , can restraint and modesty be taught to those who do not have it ? 
Strangely , it may be easier to gain confidence than to restrain it . 
Confidence can come from three things : hope , pride , and progress . 
Success breeds confidence , and confidence brings progress . 
Today &apos;s Chinese and Indians are now convinced that they are succeeding . 
They see in the West a mixture of respect for their achievements and apprehension for the challenge they now pose , and that fills them with pride . 
Attempting to impose democracy on others is an act of unbounded arrogance . 
But democracy is also the best remedy against overconfidence , because it allows ordinary people to decide whether their leaders are behaving arrogantly or responsibly . 
Only the self-correcting mechanisms of truly democratic regimes can ensure the right balance .
