Berlusconi on the Boil 
Silvio Berlusconi was elected as Italy &apos;s prime minister after campaigning on a platform of reinvigorating the economy through tax cuts and liberalization . 
After three years in office , he has not delivered on his economic agenda and his government is in shambles . 
What went wrong ? 
Italy &apos;s economic ills are well known . 
At the risk of over-simplifying , they can be grouped under three headings : 
· Weak public finances . 
When Italy joined the European Monetary Union , its primary budget surplus ( tax receipts in excess of government spending , excluding interest payments ) was about 5 % of national income . 
In 2004 , the surplus will shrink to about 1.5 % - before the tax cuts that Berlusconi promised for next year . 
Excessive social welfare spending ( mainly public pensions ) and the cost of servicing the public debt drain resources from more productive government spending and impose a high tax burden . 
The government has failed to take any meaningful action , and the problem is getting worse . 
Unsurprisingly , the rating agency Standard 
Poor &apos;s recently downgraded Italian public debt . 
· Declining competitiveness . 
Italy &apos;s most dynamic producers are small manufacturing firms in traditional sectors with relatively low technological content . 
With these firms now exposed to foreign competition from low-cost producers in Asia and Eastern Europe , Italy &apos;s share of world exports has been shrinking in recent years . 
Italy has a few large corporations , mainly in services , utilities , or sectors shielded from competition . 
These monopolistic producers act like a distorting tax on the rest of the economy . 
Smaller but more competitive manufacturing firms lack the resources to expand in more advanced technological sectors . 
The volume of private and public R D spending is one of the lowest among industrial countries . 
As a result , Italy is receiving immigrants with relatively low skills , while many of its most productive young graduates emigrate to the US , the UK , or other European countries . 
The government has done little to remedy this . 
Liberalization attempts in energy and public utilities have faltered , perhaps also because the government pockets monopoly rents through dividends from public enterprises . 
Privatization has stalled . 
· The Mezzogiorno . 
Labor productivity is traditionally much lower in Italy &apos;s south than in the rest of the country . 
But centralized wage negotiations impose the same salary everywhere . 
So many in the South remain poor and out of work , particularly the young . 
Early on , the government proposed legislation to increase labor market flexibility and relax constraints on firing rules . 
But its strategy of dividing the trade unions failed and some of the proposed legislation was eventually withdrawn . 
Why has the government achieved so little , despite a large majority in Parliament , widespread backing among the population , and supportive media ? 
The main reason is government infighting . 
In a well functioning democracy , electoral competition between government and opposition induces the government to pursue efficient policies . 
Not so in Italy , where the main site of electoral competition has always been within the governing coalition . 
Each government party is afraid of losing votes to its coalition partners , and undermines or blocks whatever the government is trying to do . 
The result is policy paralysis , until time has run out for everyone . 
The same problems led to the collapse of the previous government ( a left-wing coalition led by current EU Commission President Romano Prodi ) , and they would certainly continue under a new government if a left-wing coalition was voted into office at the next election . 
Unstable coalition governments have been typical of Italy &apos;s postwar politics . 
In an attempt to solve the problem , a mixed electoral system was introduced in the early 1990 &apos;s , with about three quarters of the seats assigned under plurality rule in single member districts and the rest allocated under proportional representation . 
But the hope that this would ensure greater stability has been unfulfilled . 
The residual proportional component of the electoral system has kept many political parties alive . 
Because all of them compete for these proportional seats , government infighting remains acute . 
A logical solution would be to scrap the proportional component of the electoral system altogether , and move decisively toward a two-party political system under fully majoritarian elections . 
But that is unlikely . 
On the contrary , the smaller centrist parties that scored a victory in the recent European Parliament elections are now demanding a return to full proportionality . 
If they get it , matters will most likely go from bad to worse . 
Under the current system , Italian governments achieve little , but at least they last longer . 
A return to full proportionality would probably mean a return to rapid government turnover , which carries with it the risk that policy horizons will also become shorter . 
As Italians know all too well , government instability inevitably breeds financial volatility .
