Just Say No to Bush 
For three years , America &apos;s president has pursued a unilateralist agenda , ignoring all evidence that contradicts his positions , and putting aside basic and longstanding American principles . 
Take global warming . 
Here Bush is conspicuously absent without leave ( AWOL in military jargon ) . 
Time and again , he questions the scientific evidence . 
( Of course , Bush &apos;s academic credentials were never very impressive . ) 
Bush &apos;s position is more than wrong ; it is an embarrassment . 
Indeed , when asked by Bush to look into the matter , America &apos;s National Academy of Sciences came to a resounding verdict ( the only one they could honestly reach ) that greenhouse gases are a menace . 
But America &apos;s automakers love their gas-guzzlers , and Bush &apos;s oil industry pals want no interference with their destruction of the planet &apos;s atmosphere . 
So no change in policy . 
In Iraq , Bush again pursued a unilateralist agenda , saying that there was incontrovertible evidence of a link with Al Queda , and that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction . 
Even before the invasion , there was overwhelming evidence that Bush was lying . 
Detection technology made it clear that Iraq did not have nuclear weapons , as chief UN inspector Hans Blix pointed out . 
It &apos;s possible that Bush read those reports , but that they were beyond his comprehension . 
It is also possible that he did not believe what he read . 
Whatever the case , American policy was not based on evidence . 
Since the Cold War &apos;s end , America is the world &apos;s sole superpower . 
Yet it has failed to exercise the kind of leadership needed to create a new world order based on principles like fairness . 
Europe and the rest of the world are aware of this ; but they don &apos;t vote in American elections . 
Even so , the rest of the world is not powerless . 
Instead , the rest of the world should just say no . 
America has not won the hearts and minds of those in Iraq ; indeed , it has lost them , just as it has lost the hearts and minds of much of the world . 
The US wants to retain control of the occupation , but it wants others to receive the bullets now mowing down American soldiers . 
UN soldiers should not bear the consequence of America &apos;s failure to manage the occupation , so US cries for financial help should fall on deaf ears . 
What sympathy does the US agenda deserve , when President Bush has ladled out tax cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars to the richest people in the world . 
It was not long ago that a Republican Congress held up $ 1 billion of UN dues , and threatened that it would only pay what it owed if the UN satisfied a raft of conditions . 
America &apos;s unwillingness to provide small sums to wage peace contrasts sharply with the huge amounts Congress quickly granted to wage war . 
Advocates of a softer approach say that if the UN stays on the sidelines , it will become irrelevant ; by participating in Iraq , it will build trust with America , so that the next time a dispute such as this arises , America will turn earlier to the UN . 
Nonsense . 
Those in the White House today believe in 
I normally write about economics , not politics . 
But in the new world of globalization , there is greater economic interdependence , which requires more collective action , rules and institutions , and an international rule of law . 
Economic globalization has , however , outpaced political globalization ; the processes for decision making are far from democratic , or even transparent . 
In no small measure , the failures of globalization can be traced to the same mindset that led to the failures in Iraq : multilateral institutions must serve not just one country &apos;s interest , but all countries &apos; . 
At the recent World Trade Organization ( WTO ) meeting in Cancun , the developing countries put America - and Europe - on notice that this system can no longer continue . 
In that case , Europe was as much the culprit as America . 
Europe has no trouble seeing the dangers of unilateralism in America &apos;s actions , in everything from abandoning Kyoto to its refusal to join the International Criminal Court . 
But Europe should also reflect on its own practices , including trade policy , where the EU works systematically to unbalance the global trade regime against developing countries , despite promising that those imbalances would be corrected in the current round of trade negotiations . 
Here , Europe acts like America , which has long talked the rhetoric of free trade , while its actions have long ignored the principles . 
Forget about America &apos;s rhetoric of upholding fairness and justice ; in trade negotiations , the US ignores the pleas of the poorest countries of the world to eliminate the cotton subsidies that have had so devastating an effect on them . 
If we are to make the world politically more secure and economically more stable and prosperous , political globalization will have to catch up with economic globalization . 
Principles of democracy , social justice , social solidarity , and the rule of law need to be extended beyond national boundaries . 
Europe and the rest of the world will have to do their part - abiding by these principles themselves , and giving each other , and America , a shove in the right direction . 
Right now , this entails &apos; Just Saying No &apos; to President Bush .
