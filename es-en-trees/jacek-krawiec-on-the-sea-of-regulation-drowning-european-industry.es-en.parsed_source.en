Europe &apos;s Red-Tape Economy 
WARSAW - Over the past 60 years , the project of European integration has confronted many challenges : post-war economic hardships , the heavy yoke of communism , and the uncertain footing of the post-Cold War world . 
European business is bound up in rules and regulations , many of which originate from unelected officials in Brussels , whose laudable intention to harmonize business conditions across the EU is instead sapping the continent &apos;s commercial creativity and dynamism . 
As a result , economic performance has become sluggish as competitiveness declines and unemployment , especially among young people , remains stubbornly high . 
EU institutions issue thousands of regulations , directives , and decisions every year . 
In 2012 , 1,799 laws were enacted ; in 2011 , there were 2,062 . 
Some laws , enacted long ago for a European Community of six founding members , are still on the books . 
It is this thicket of red tape that hampers business and deters entrepreneurs . 
One small but important example of this is the average cost of setting up a business , which is € 158 ( $ 212 ) in Canada , € 664 in the US , and € 2,285 in the EU ( and as much as € 4,141 in Italy ) . 
The sheer cost of getting started is as big a deterrent as one can imagine for a young entrepreneur trying to escape the bounds of unemployment . 
European industry is afflicted by similar problems . 
The refining and petrochemical sector supplies the EU with a large proportion of its fuel , and is also a major source of tax revenue . 
The downstream sector , together with fuels distribution , contributes a total of around € 240 billion annually to treasury coffers . 
By any reckoning , this is an important industry that should not suffer from overregulation . 
Excessive law-making has pushed up prices and pushed out investors , not only from refining and petrochemicals , but from all energy-intensive sectors , including aluminum , steel , and cement . 
In some EU states , electricity prices for industrial customers are twice what their North American counterparts pay . 
Overly complex climate regulations , political resistance to shale-gas development , and energy policies that favor expensive , ineffective technologies are largely to blame . 
Some policymakers in Brussels are gradually beginning to recognize that lower energy prices might be good for the economy . 
They assume that robust recovery and job creation will emerge simply of their own accord ; as a result , rather than enjoying sustainable growth , Europe is heading toward a model for which a new term - &quot; sustainable stagnation &quot; - might be appropriate . 
This approach is a colossal waste of money . 
As Bjørn Lomborg of the Copenhagen Consensus Center notes , &quot; The European Union will pay $ 250 billion for its current climate policies each and every year for 87 years . 
For almost $ 20 trillion , temperatures by the end of the century will have been reduced by a negligible 0.05ºC. &quot; 
By contrast , the EU is allocating a paltry € 8 billion over seven years to alleviate youth unemployment , which currently runs close to 60 % in some member states . 
But Europe &apos;s economy will not grow , and a sufficient number of jobs will not be created , if such vital industries as aluminum , steel , fuels , plastics , and cement are not allowed to thrive . 
This outcome would be bad not only for the economy , but also for the environment , because these industries will simply continue relocating to markets with far worse environmental records . 
The problem is not a lack of investment capital . 
In 2011 , Europe &apos;s publicly traded firms had an estimated € 750 billion in cash sitting on their balance sheets , equivalent to twice the decline in private-sector investment in the EU from 2007 to 2011 . 
Europe &apos;s governments urgently need to undertake a root-and-branch review of the regulatory environment , especially in those industries that have the greatest impact on the wider economy . 
And , after six decades of meddling , EU policymakers should step back and consider which restrictions have become harmful or irrelevant , and how better to support the entrepreneurs and industries of the future . 
Much of the groundwork has already been laid by the OECD , in several guiding principles : economic goals , especially growth and competitiveness , should be as important as social and environmental goals ; a regulation &apos;s benefits must justify its costs ; regulations should be reviewed frequently , and a cost-benefit analysis of all the alternatives - including simply maintaining the status quo - should always be carried out . 
With 7 % of the global population , 25 % of global GDP , and 50 % of global welfare expenditure , the EU has created a model that inspires millions of people to dream of emigrating to Europe . 
However , the EU &apos;s historic emphasis on achieving its social goals , to the exclusion of industry &apos;s long-term needs , is undermining the entire European project . 
The EU cannot be the inclusive , thriving , and democratic home that millions dream of if red tape is allowed to strangle the industries that are crucial to European prosperity .
