Twilight of Our Political Gods 
For some time I thought that the Twenty-Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was probably the best way to ensure that political leaders do not overstay their welcome , and , just as importantly , wear out their effectiveness . 
This Amendment bars US Presidents from holding office for more than two four-year terms . 
Perhaps I had forgotten the travails of President George W. Bush &apos;s predecessors in their second term , but his own current predicament shows that the constitutional limit has its own problems . 
For one thing , it makes the President a lame duck sometime in his second term . 
Does anyone remember that after his re-election Bush promised to reform the pension system ( &quot; Social Security &quot; ) ? 
Now he is clearly hamstrung not only by the Democratic opposition , but also , and perhaps more so , by the succession struggles within his own party . 
However , the fate of Bush &apos;s friend , British Prime Minister Tony Blair , shows that lame-duck status can occur even without a constitutional term limit - indeed , without a written constitution at all . 
Blair made the fatal mistake of setting his own limit to his tenure of office by saying that he would not contest a fourth election as leader of the Labour Party . 
Indeed , reforms announced by Blair increasingly sound like empty promises , because the apparently inevitable has happened : the Prime Minister has lost touch with the public . 
What used to be his charisma is now the permanent re-enactment of the all-too-familiar . 
Of course , it is always very hard for leaders to relinquish power . 
Some have done so , more or less voluntarily , only to re-emerge suddenly from oblivion . 
Can it be the same President Oscar Arias who ( barely ) won the recent presidential election in Costa Rica and now returns to power after 20 years ? 
And was not Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s candidate for the presidency of the Italian Senate , Giulio Andreotti , a junior member of one of Italy &apos;s first post-1945 governments ? 
Did Portugal &apos;s Cavaco Silva , the successful Prime Minister of the 1990 &quot; s , have to reappear as President in 2006 ? 
Who can forget Margaret Thatcher &apos;s tears when her &quot; friends &quot; told her that her time was up ? 
When Prime Minister Harold Wilson suddenly resigned in 1976 and left No. 10 Downing Street to the late James Callaghan , people became suspicious : had he been forced out by some secret service plot concerning South Africa ? 
It appears that there is no way for political leaders to leave the scene gracefully . 
Even if there is an &quot; orderly transition &quot; - a term much used about Tony Blair and Gordon Brown at the moment - it is accompanied by sorrow , or at least by pain . 
Political office , it seems , is more addictive than heroin . 
Abandoning the habit involves not only the inconvenience of losing perks and a certain lifestyle , but also the loss of power . 
Power may be increasingly illusory in a globalized world , but it is an illusion that is shared by others , and the longer one inhabits it , the more one &apos;s circle consists of others who share the belief . 
The addiction to political office is always worrisome , because democracies turn into autocracies when leaders cease to recognize the limits of their power . 
Disconnection is the beginning , followed by the belief that one is the only person who knows what is right and good . 
When Tony Blair says that the most important liberty is security from terrorist attacks , he has forgotten the first principles of his party and his country . 
Overstaying one &apos;s welcome may be the professional disease of political leaders , but it is above all incompatible with democracy as a framework for bringing about change without violence . 
The question , then , is whether there is any way to ensure that political leaders leave in time . 
While the US Constitution shows the limits of institutional safeguards , the role of political parties is clearly significant when it comes to limiting terms in power . 
Like Thatcher , Blair now hears from his party that he should go and replies that &quot; the people &quot; still want him . 
Yet the party might have a better sense of what is viable not just today , but also tomorrow - at the next election , for example . 
In the end , there is no foolproof method to guarantee that political leaders leave without tears . 
What matters is that mechanisms are in place that do make them leave , probably rather too late , and certainly with some pain and unhappiness , but in time for the constitution of liberty to remain intact .
