America &apos;s Overrated Decline 
CAMBRIDGE - With the approach of the US Congressional elections , questions about the health of America &apos;s political institutions and the future of its global leadership have become rampant , with some citing partisan gridlock as evidence of America &apos;s decline . 
According to the political scientist Sarah Binder , the ideological divide between America &apos;s two main political parties has not been as large as it is now since the end of the nineteenth century . 
Despite the current gridlock , however , the 111th Congress managed to pass a major fiscal stimulus , health-care reform , financial regulation , an arms-control treaty , and revision of the military policy on homosexuality . 
Clearly , the US political system cannot be written off ( especially if partisan gridlock is cyclical ) . 
Nonetheless , today &apos;s Congress is plagued by low legislative capacity . 
Though ideological consistency has more than doubled over the last two decades , from 10 % to 21 % of the public , most Americans do not have uniformly conservative or liberal views , and want their representatives to meet one another halfway . 
Political parties , however , have become more consistently ideological since the 1970s . 
This is not a new problem for the US , whose constitution is based on the eighteenth-century liberal view that power is best controlled by fragmentation and countervailing checks and balances , with the president and Congress forced to compete for control in areas like foreign policy . 
In other words , the US government was designed to be inefficient , in order to ensure that it could not easily threaten the liberty of its citizens . 
This inefficiency has likely contributed to the decline in confidence in American institutions . 
Today , less than one-fifth of the public trusts the federal government to do the right thing most of the time , compared to three-quarters in 1964 . 
Of course , these figures surged occasionally during that period , such as after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks ; but the overall decline is considerable . 
The federal government is not alone . 
Over the last several decades , public confidence in many influential institutions has plummeted . 
From 1964-1997 , the share of Americans who trusted universities fell from 61 % to 30 % , while trust in major companies fell from 55 % to 21 % . 
Trust in medical institutions dropped from 73 % to 29 % , and in journalism from 29 % to 14 % . 
Over the last decade , confidence in educational institutions and the military has recovered , but trust in Wall Street and large corporations has continued to fall . 
But these ostensibly alarming figures can be misleading . 
In fact , 82 % of Americans still consider the US to be the world &apos;s best place to live , and 90 % like their democratic system of government . 
Americans may not be entirely satisfied with their leaders , but the country is certainly not on the brink of an Arab Spring-style revolution . 
Moreover , though party politics have become more polarized in recent decades , this follows the 1950s and early 1960s , when the escape from the Great Depression and victory in World War II fueled unusually high confidence in US institutions . 
Moreover , declining trust in the government has not been accompanied by significant changes in citizens &quot; behavior . 
For example , the Internal Revenue Service is among the government institutions that inspire the least public confidence ; yet there has been no major surge in tax evasion . 
In terms of controlling corruption , the US still scores in the 90th percentile . 
The loss of confidence that Americans have expressed may be rooted in a deeper shift in people &apos;s attitudes toward individualism , which has brought about decreased deference to authority . 
Indeed , similar patterns are characteristic of most post-modern societies . 
This social shift probably will not influence US institutions &quot; effectiveness as much as one might think , given America &apos;s decentralized federal system . 
In fact , gridlock in the national capital is often accompanied by political cooperation and innovation at the state and municipal levels , leading citizens to view state and local governments , as well as many government agencies , much more favorably than the federal government . 
This approach to governance has had a profound impact on the mentality of the American people . 
A 2002 study indicated that three-quarters of Americans feel connected to their communities , and consider their quality of life to be excellent or good , with nearly half of adults participating in a civic group or activity . 
That is good news for the US . 
Whether such sources of gridlock can be overcome remains to be seen . 
But , as the conservative author David Frum notes , over the last two decades , the US has experienced a swift decline in crime , auto fatalities , alcohol and tobacco consumption , and emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide , which cause acid rain - all while leading an Internet revolution . 
Given this , dire comparisons to , say , the decline of Rome are simply unwarranted .
