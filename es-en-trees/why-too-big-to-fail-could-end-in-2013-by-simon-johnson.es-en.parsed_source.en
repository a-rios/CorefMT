Financial Reform &apos;s Breakthrough Year 
ZANZIBAR - Here &apos;s an odd prediction for the coming year : 2013 will be a watershed for financial reform . 
True , while the global financial crisis erupted more than four years ago , and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms were adopted in the United States back in 2010 , not much has changed about how Wall Street operates - except that the large firms have become bigger and more powerful . 
Yet there are reasons to expect real progress in the new year . 
The US Federal Reserve is finally shifting its thinking . 
In a series of major speeches this fall , Governor Dan Tarullo made the case that the problem of &quot; too big to fail &quot; financial institutions remains with us . 
We need to take additional measures to reduce the level of systemic risk - including limiting the size of our largest banks . 
News reports indicate that the Fed has already started saying no to some bank mergers . 
At the same time , the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has become a bastion of sensible thinking on financial-sector issues . 
In part , this is because the FDIC is responsible for cleaning up the mess when financial-sector firms fail , so its senior officials have a strong incentive to protect its insurance fund by preventing risks from getting out of control . 
The FDIC is showing intellectual leadership as well as organizational capabilities - Vice Chairman Tom Hoenig &apos;s speeches are a must-read . 
Wall Street is pushing back , of course . 
But the rolling series of scandals surrounding global megabanks makes it difficult for anyone to keep a straight face when executives insist that our largest banks must maintain their current scale and scope . 
Do we need HSBC to facilitate global money laundering ? 
Do we need Barclays and UBS to manipulate Libor ( a key benchmark for interest rates around the world ) ? 
Do we need still more losses at poorly run trading operations for JP Morgan Chase ? 
The pro-bank lobby groups are positioning themselves to argue that the new resolution powers under Dodd-Frank have ended the too-big-to-fail problem , and we can expect a public-relations drive in this direction early in the new year . 
But the consensus view at the most recent meeting of the FDIC &apos;s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee ( of which I am a member ) was that this claim should not be taken seriously . 
Under Dodd-Frank , it is arguably easier for the FDIC to handle the failure of a single large financial institution than it was in pre-Dodd-Frank days . 
But what if two or three or seven firms are all in trouble at the same time ? 
The answer , as former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker implied at the meeting , is that we would be right back where we started - in the panic and frozen credit markets that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 . 
Indeed , the idea that substantial shocks could soon hit the US financial system is not far-fetched . 
The European debt crisis , for example , remains far from being resolved . 
A significant sovereign-debt restructuring there would bring down European banks and potentially damage US banks - as well as financial institutions around the world . 
Meanwhile , the continuing problems at European banks are a stark reminder that operating highly leveraged , thinly capitalized firms is incredibly risky . 
And the regulatory failures in Europe - consider the German Landesbanks , for example - will become only more obvious in the coming months . 
Creating a common supervisory authority will mean nothing unless it can clean up the mess created by the existing supervisors . 
And that cleanup will expose more of the rot in banks &quot; current operations . 
The need for banks to finance themselves with more equity and relatively less debt will be the focus of one of the main publishing events in economics in 2013 . 
Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig &apos;s The Bankers &quot; New Clothes : What &apos;s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About it ? will appear officially in March , but advance copies are already being closely read in leading central banks . 
Bankers everywhere will rush to read it before their regulators do . 
The road to the ongoing financial and economic crisis was built on a foundation of intellectual capture : not only regulators , but academics , too , became captivated by modern finance and its methods . 
Admati and Hellwig are at the vanguard of the counterrevolution , challenging the great myths of banking head-on . 
Do we need financial institutions to be so highly leveraged ( that is , carrying so much debt relative to equity ) ? 
No , they argue . 
If banks of all kinds were financed with more equity , they would have stronger buffers to absorb losses . 
Both the equity and the debt issued by well-capitalized banks would be safer - and therefore cheaper . 
Bankers want to be so highly leveraged for a simple reason : implicit government guarantees mean that they get the upside when things go well , while the downside is someone else &apos;s problem . 
Contrary to bankers &quot; claims , this is not a good arrangement for society . 
Admati and Hellwig are confronting the bankers and their allies in no uncertain terms , grounding their argument in deep financial thinking , yet writing for a broad audience . 
Whatever else happens in 2013 , we can be sure that they will not win the Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year award .
