German Reunification and the New Europe 
PARIS - I began writing this column shortly after a remarkable anniversary . 
October 3 , 1990 , was the effective date for the implementation of a stunning decision taken barely a month earlier . 
On August 23 , East Germany &apos;s House of Representatives , the Volkskammer , voted for unilateral adherence by the East German Länder to West Germany &apos;s Constitution . 
Article 23 of the West German Basic Law permitted this , but neither West Germany &apos;s government nor its Parliament had been consulted ! 
Reunification terms were subsequently defined in a Treaty signed in Berlin on August 31 , 1990 , and ratified by both the East and West German parliaments on September 20 . 
The Peace Treaty between the two German states and the four victorious Allies was signed in Moscow on the same day , and reunification was officially proclaimed on October 3 . 
These events , accomplished by three actors , shook the world - and changed it forever . 
The first actor was Mikhail Gorbachev , who approved the act - the opening of the border between Austria and Hungary - that triggered the chain of events leading to reunification . 
And it was Gorbachev who proclaimed that Soviet forces would not intervene to support troubled communist regimes against the will of their people - a declaration aimed directly at East Germany . 
The second key figure was West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who rushed into the opened breach , overriding his Allies &quot; caution , while the third actor was the East German people , who rushed into the streets , regardless of the risks , to demonstrate and push reunification forward . 
These events had a profound impact on relations between Germany and its allies . 
The United States , Great Britain , and France all seemed to think that everything was happening too fast , that international security was at risk should the new Germany not confirm its membership in NATO ( which Germany finally did ) . 
But for a few months , there were fears that Russia would demand Germany &apos;s withdrawal from the Alliance as a condition of its agreement to reunification . 
While the US masked its doubts , Great Britain and France were less at ease . 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher limited herself to worried public statements , but French President François Mitterrand felt it necessary to improvise a visit to East Berlin , against the opinion of his Foreign Ministry and despite the French people &apos;s great enthusiasm for German reunification . 
Mitterrand hoped to slow the process and to link negotiations to some international guarantees . 
His effort was a fiasco , remembered in Berlin to this day . 
The motive of Mitterrand &apos;s &quot; mission &quot; was to determine what precautions could or should be taken against the potential vagaries of this powerful but unpredictable people . 
The response was eventually enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty , which extended the European Union &apos;s competences to foreign affairs and judicial matters , making them partly supranational . 
Great Britain and Denmark , however , insisted that these new competences be exercised on intergovernmental grounds only , not by the European Commission , and thus only through consensus . 
France did not vote , so Great Britain and Denmark won by default . 
Europe would take common action related to foreign affairs only on unanimous grounds . 
Political Europe was stillborn at the moment of greatest potential . 
This was a major disappointment for Germany , particularly as it could no longer count on France , its main ally in Europe . 
In Germany itself , failure to achieve a politically integrated federal Europe baffled pro-integration political forces and dented the war generation &apos;s moral authority . 
The New Germany and its post-war generation felt tempted to recover a reunified , yet lonely , German identity , one with influence in Europe and worldwide . 
As a result , reunified Germany naturally fell back on its old sphere of dominance , Eastern Europe . 
But Germany &apos;s leaders were uneasy with these changes . 
In September 1994 , two MPs from the majority Christian Democratic Union published a political statement on Europe , questioning its future , particularly the prospect of federalism . 
A dismal silence greeted its publication , which left Germany &apos;s pro-European establishment isolated and dispirited . 
Indeed , in May 2000 , Joschka Fischer , the ex-leader of the Green Party and German Foreign Minister , gave a long speech about the necessity of European integration . 
The question about European federalism was posed to all member states , and none answered . 
France , obviously in the limelight , remained silent , again leaving Germany to feel abandoned by its partners . 
A process of erosion , catalyzed by British diplomacy , was under way . 
It succeeded . 
The prospect of genuine European integration on foreign affairs and defense issues was denied time and again , at each step of the successive negotiations for the Treaties of Amsterdam , Nice , the aborted constitutional project , and Lisbon . 
Time passed , generations changed . 
In today &apos;s Germany , because no one with decisive power in business , finance , or government experienced the war , the European project is no longer viewed as conditioning Europe &apos;s collective future . 
These new leaders envision Europe only as a trade regime . 
Meanwhile , German diplomacy is actively reconstructing the country &apos;s economic and cultural spheres of influence , and not only in Eastern Europe . 
The impact of this lost European perspective became clear in the autumn of 2008 when , in the aftermath of the sub-prime crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s first impulse was nationalistic and wholly anti-European . 
There would be no common European plan to address the crisis , and no call for public funds . 
Germany would protect its banks &apos;depositors on its own and through private means . 
Only the sheer gravity of the situation brought Germany back within the European realm for the subsequent G-20 meeting . 
Twenty years after reunification was completed , Germany has become one of the world &apos;s great democracies . 
Many wish that it were also more European in its outlook and behavior . 
But Germany does not bear the main responsibility for killing off the vision of political Europe .
