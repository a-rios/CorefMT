A People &apos;s Economics 
NEW HAVEN - We are in the midst of a boom in popular economics : books , articles , blogs , public lectures , all followed closely by the general public . 
I recently participated in a panel discussion of this phenomenon at the American Economic Association annual meeting in Denver . 
An apparent paradox emerged from the discussion : the boom in popular economics comes at a time when the general public seems to have lost faith in professional economists , because almost all of us failed to predict , or even warn of , the current economic crisis , the biggest since the Great Depression . 
So , why is the public buying more books by professional economists ? 
The most interesting explanation I heard was that economics has become more interesting , because it no longer seems to be a finished and closed discipline . 
It is no fun to read a book or article that says that economic forecasting is best left to computer models that you , the general reader , would need a Ph.D. to understand . 
And , in truth , the public is right : while there is a somewhat scientific basis for these models , they can go spectacularly wrong . 
Sometimes we need to turn off autopilot and think for ourselves , and when a crisis occurs , use our best human intellect . 
The panelists all said , in one way or another , that popular economics facilitates an exchange between specialized economists and the broader public - a dialogue that has never been more important . 
After all , most economists did not see this crisis coming in part because they had removed themselves from what real-world people were doing and thinking . 
Successful popular economics involves the reader or listener , in some sense , as a collaborator . 
That , of course , means that economists must be willing to include new and original theories that are not yet received doctrine among professional specialists . 
Until recently , many professional economists would be reluctant to write a popular book . 
Certainly , it would not be viewed favorably in considering a candidate for tenure or a promotion . 
Since it does not include equations or statistical tables , they would argue , it is not serious work that is worthy of scholarly attention . 
Worse than that , at least until recently , a committee evaluating an economist would likely think that writing a popular economics book that does not repeat the received wisdom of the discipline might even be professionally unethical . 
Imagine how the medical profession would view one of its members who recommended to the general public some therapy that had not yet passed scrutiny from the appropriate authorities . 
Medical professionals know how often seemingly promising new therapies turn out , after careful study , not to work , or even to be harmful . 
There is a rigorous process of scholarly review of proposed new therapies , associated with professional journals that uphold high research standards . 
Circumventing that process and promoting new , untested ideas to the general public is unprofessional . 
In the decades prior to the current financial crisis , economists gradually came to view themselves and their profession in the same way , encouraged by research trends . 
For example , after 1960 , when the University of Chicago started creating a Univac computer tape that contained systematic information about millions of stock prices , a great deal of scientific research on the properties of stock prices was taken as confirming the &quot; efficient markets hypothesis . &quot; 
The competitive forces that underlie stock exchanges were seen to force all securities prices to their true fundamental values . 
All trading schemes not based on this hypothesis were labeled as either misguided or outright frauds . 
Science had triumphed over stock-market punditry - or so it seemed . 
The financial crisis delivered a fatal blow to that overconfidence in scientific economics . 
It is not just that the profession didn &apos;t forecast the crisis . 
Their models , taken literally , sometimes suggested that a crisis of this magnitude couldn &apos;t happen . 
One way to interpret this is that the economics profession was not fully accounting for the economy &apos;s human element , an element that can &apos;t be reduced to mathematical analysis . 
The relatively few professional economists who warned of the current crisis were people , it seems , who not only read the scholarly economics literature , but also brought into play more personal judgment : intuitive comparisons with past historical episodes ; conclusions about speculative trading , price bubbles , and the stability of confidence ; evaluations of the moral purposes of economic actors ; and impressions that complacency had set in , lulling watchdogs to sleep . 
These were judgments made by economists who were familiar with our business leadership - their inspirations , beliefs , subterfuges , and rationalizations . 
Their views could never be submitted to a scholarly journal and evaluated the way a new medical procedure is . 
There is no established scientific procedure that could prove their validity . 
Of course , economics is in many ways a science , and the work of our scholars and their computer models really does matter . 
But , as the economist Edwin R. A. Seligman put it in 1889 , &quot; Economics is a social science , i.e. , it is an ethical and therefore an historical science .... It is not a natural science , and therefore not an exact or purely abstract science . &quot; 
To me , and no doubt to the other panelists , part of the process of pursuing the inexact aspects of economics is speaking honestly to the broader public , looking them in the eye , learning from them , reading the emails they send , and then searching one &apos;s soul to decide whether one &apos;s favored theory is really close to the truth .
