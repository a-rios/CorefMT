Borlaug and the Bankers 
NEW YORK - The recent death of Norman Borlaug provides an opportune moment to reflect on basic values and on our economic system . 
Borlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in bringing about the &quot; green revolution , &quot; which saved hundreds of millions from hunger and changed the global economic landscape . 
Before Borlaug , the world faced the threat of a Malthusian nightmare : growing populations in the developing world and insufficient food supplies . 
Consider the trauma a country like India might have suffered if its population of a half-billion had remained barely fed as it doubled . 
Before the green revolution , Nobel Prize-winning economist Gunnar Myrdal predicted a bleak future for an Asia mired in poverty . 
Instead , Asia has become an economic powerhouse . 
Likewise , Africa &apos;s welcome new determination to fight the war on hunger should serve as a living testament to Borlaug . 
The fact that the green revolution never came to the world &apos;s poorest continent , where agricultural productivity is just one-third the level in Asia , suggests that there is ample room for improvement . 
The green revolution may , of course , prove to be only a temporary respite . 
Soaring food prices before the global financial crisis provided a warning , as does the slowing rate of growth of agricultural productivity . 
India &apos;s agriculture sector , for example , has fallen behind the rest of its dynamic economy , living on borrowed time , as levels of ground water , on which much of the country depends , fall precipitously . 
But Borlaug &apos;s death at 95 also is a reminder of how skewed our system of values has become . 
When Borlaug received news of the award , at four in the morning , he was already toiling in the Mexican fields , in his never-ending quest to improve agricultural productivity . 
He did it not for some huge financial compensation , but out of conviction and a passion for his work . 
What a contrast between Borlaug and the Wall Street financial wizards that brought the world to the brink of ruin . 
Without any other compass , the incentive structures they adopted did motivate them - not to introduce new products to improve ordinary people &quot; lives or to help them manage the risks they faced , but to put the global economy at risk by engaging in short-sighted and greedy behavior . 
Their innovations focused on circumventing accounting and financial regulations designed to ensure transparency , efficiency , and stability , and to prevent the exploitation of the less informed . 
There is also a deeper point in this contrast : our societies tolerate inequalities because they are viewed to be socially useful ; it is the price we pay for having incentives that motivate people to act in ways that promote societal well-being . 
Neoclassical economic theory , which has dominated in the West for a century , holds that each individual &apos;s compensation reflects his marginal social contribution - what he adds to society . 
By doing well , it is argued , people do good . 
But Borlaug and our bankers refute that theory . 
If neoclassical theory were correct , Borlaug would have been among the wealthiest men in the world , while our bankers would have been lining up at soup kitchens . 
Of course , there is a grain of truth in neoclassical theory ; if there weren &apos;t , it probably wouldn &apos;t have survived as long as it has ( though bad ideas often survive in economics remarkably well ) . 
Nevertheless , the simplistic economics of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , when neoclassical theories arose , are wholly unsuited to twenty-first-century economies . 
In large corporations , it is often difficult to ascertain the contribution of any individual . 
Such corporations are rife with &quot; agency &quot; problems : while decision-makers ( CEO &apos;s ) are supposed to act on behalf of their shareholders , they have enormous discretion to advance their own interests - and they often do . 
Bank officers may have walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars , but everyone else in our society - shareholders , bondholders , taxpayers , homeowners , workers - suffered . 
Their investors are too often pension funds , which also face an agency problem , because their executives make decisions on behalf of others . 
In such a world , private and social interests often diverge , as we have seen so dramatically in this crisis . 
Does anyone really believe that America &apos;s bank officers suddenly became so much more productive , relative to everyone else in society , that they deserve the huge compensation increases they have received in recent years ? 
Does anyone really believe that America &apos;s CEO &apos;s are that much more productive than those in other countries , where compensation is more modest ? 
Worse , in America stock options became a preferred form of compensation - often worth more than an executive &apos;s base pay . 
Stock options reward executives generously even when shares rise because of a price bubble - and even when comparable firms &quot; shares are performing better . 
Not surprisingly , stock options create strong incentives for short-sighted and excessively risky behavior , as well as for &quot; creative accounting , &quot; which executives throughout the economy perfected with off-balance-sheet shenanigans . 
The skewed incentives distorted our economy and our society . 
We confused means with ends . 
Our bloated financial sector grew to the point that in the United States it accounted for more than 40 % of corporate profits . 
But the worst effects were on our human capital , our most precious resource . 
Absurdly generous compensation in the financial sector induced some of our best minds to go into banking . 
Who knows how many Borlaugs there might have been among those enticed by the riches of Wall Street and the City of London ? 
If we lost even one , our world was made immeasurably poorer .
