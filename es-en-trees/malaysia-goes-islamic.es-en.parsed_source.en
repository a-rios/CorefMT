Malaysia Goes Islamic 
SINGAPORE - In Malaysia &apos;s current political climate , it is no longer possible to distinguish Islamic radicals from Islamic moderates . 
Despite official boasting about the country &apos;s diverse population and commitment to pluralism , Islam and the government have essentially merged . 
For two decades , the ruling United Malays National Organization ( UMNO ) government invested enormous public resources in building up a network of Islamic institutions . 
The government &apos;s initial intention was to deflect radical demands for an extreme version of Islamic governance . 
Over time , however , the effort to out-do its critics led the UMNO to over-Islamicize the state . 
The UMNO &apos;s program has put Sharia law , Sharia courts , and an extensive Islamic bureaucracy in place , a collective effort that has taken on a life of its own . 
The number of Islamic laws instituted has quadrupled in just over ten years . 
After Iran or Saudi Arabia , Malaysia &apos;s Sharia court system is probably the most extensive in the Muslim world , and the accompanying bureaucracy is not only big but has more bite than the national parliament . 
Islamic laws in Malaysia are based on religious doctrine but codified and passed as statutes by state parliaments . 
Not much debate attends their enactment , because a fear of heresy keeps most critics from questioning anything deemed Islamic . 
While the UMNO still trumpets its Islamic advocacy , the party is facing difficult choices , particularly as it wishes to maintain foreign investment in an increasingly polarized environment . 
For example , Minister of Home Affairs Hishamuddin Hussein recently held a press conference to support Muslims who demonstrated against the construction of a Hindu temple in their neighborhood . 
The protestors paraded a severed , bloodied cow &apos;s head in the street , then spat and stomped on it . 
This was an offense to Malaysia &apos;s Hindus , who consider the cow a sacred animal . 
Just a week earlier , a young mother by the name of Kartika was sentenced by Malaysia &apos;s Sharia court to six lashes by cane and fined $ 1500 after she was caught drinking beer at a hotel . 
Although the sentence is still in limbo , Hussein publicized his acceptance of the punishment by inviting the official floggers to his office to demonstrate how an Islamic caning would be carried out . 
They used a chair as a mock target , leaving him satisfied that Islamic caning can be appropriately used as a punishment for women . 
Ironically , Hishamuddin Hussein is far from an Islamic hard-liner . 
The son of Malaysia &apos;s third prime minister and a cousin of the current prime minister , he is widely considered modern , moderate , and cosmopolitan . 
A true hard-liner is Nik Aziz , the chief minister of Kelantan state , who is also the spiritual leader of Malaysia &apos;s largest Islamic party , PAS , which now controls two state governments . 
However , Aziz opposed the anti-Hindu protest , even calling a group of anti-Muslim protestors in the United Kingdom more civilized in their approach . 
Hence , it is no longer accurate to think of the PAS as a fundamentalist party and the UMNO as moderate . 
Party strategies are leading them in unexpected directions . 
The UMNO &apos;s more radical turn is being matched by the PAS &apos;s attempts at moderation . 
The PAS is aiming for the most unlikely of voters : non-Muslims , who account for 40 % of Malaysia &apos;s population and are increasingly alienated from the UMNO . 
The UMNO , meanwhile , is intent on dividing the opposition coalition , of which the PAS is a member . 
The coalition is currently led by former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim , and has picked up political momentum from real gains in last year &apos;s general election . 
Concerned by its losses , the UMNO has staked a claim to the defense of Islam in Malaysia . 
The &quot; cow head &quot; protest , which was led by UMNO members , quickly fuelled racially-charged manipulation of public sentiment . 
The formula is simple : portray Islam as being threatened by infidels , and then have the UMNO ride to the rescue of the besieged Muslim community . 
The caning of Kartika , on the other hand , is not an example of political manipulation , and for this reason is perhaps even more worrisome . 
Her sentence was roundly supported by modernist Muslim intellectuals , who insisted that the punishment was justly applied and cannot be questioned because it has divine sanction . 
These are not politicians , but former idealists who are happy that their goals of Islamicizing the state are being realized . 
Most are anti-UMNO and support the PAS . 
As a result , the UMNO finds itself squeezed between an Islamic lobby that presses for greater &quot; Talibanization &quot; of the country and the rising voices of international critics , who cannot be ignored , because the party needs both radical supporters and foreign investors to stay in power . 
Balancing these two constituencies is becoming increasingly difficult for the UMNO . 
Islamic politics has now taken on a life of its own . 
But the opposition will also be forced to figure out the role of religion in Malaysia , if ever they get an opportunity to form a government . 
As a young Islamic radical , Anwar Ibrahim used to ask : How does one Islamicize government ? Now he has to figure out how one governs it .
