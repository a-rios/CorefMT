Another Great Leap Forward for Development 
MADRID - Next month , the world will achieve a milestone for global development efforts . 
The United Nations General Assembly will adopt the Sustainable Development Goals , an ambitious set of global objectives expected to improve the lives of millions of people by 2030 . 
The fact that the SDGs are being established on the UN &apos;s 70th anniversary could not be more appropriate . 
Though the UN &apos;s record over the last seven decades has not been perfect , with many instances of inadequate responses , its success in engaging the world in the pursuit of shared objectives like development has been impressive . 
In 2000 , the UN adopted a development agenda underpinned by the so-called Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) and guided by the principle that no one should have to suffer the consequences of extreme poverty . 
At that time , very few people believed that the goals could be attained by the 2015 target date . 
But , although poverty has not been eliminated , there has been significant progress - and some major victories . 
Since 1990 ( the reference year for measuring improvement ) , the number of people living in extreme poverty ( living on less than $ 1.25 a day ) has fallen by 33 % , from 1.9 billion to 836 million worldwide , with most of that progress coming after the MDGs entered into effect . 
The number of people with access to safe drinking water has increased by 15 % , to 1.9 billion . 
Infant mortality has been cut by more than half , and maternal mortality by 45 % . 
Likewise , primary-school enrollment rates have risen from 83 % to 91 % since 2000 . 
The number of new HIV / AIDS infections has dropped by 40 % . 
And official development assistance from developed countries has risen by 66 % . 
These figures show that , with well-defined objectives and real action , it is possible to bring about big changes . 
This idea was instrumental in designing the post-2015 development agenda . 
The SDGs build on the MDGs &quot; success , while adding a new dimension : sustainability . 
World leaders now recognize that efforts to meet development needs today must not jeopardize future generations &quot; prospects . 
The sustainability dimension brings with it a universality that was lacking from the MDGs . 
Developed countries are no longer just enablers of progress , earmarking a percentage of their GDP to support the efforts of developing countries to reduce poverty , improve health , and raise living standards . 
Instead , they must be committed and active participants in the effort to achieve the agreed goals , in some cases even modifying their own domestic policies . 
In this sense , the SDGs more clearly reflect the conviction , upheld by the UN , that all of us are global citizens . 
This conviction lies behind the establishment of international humanitarian law and the supranational courts that address violations of it . 
And it underpinned the adoption of the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; principle , which demands that the international community defend a country &apos;s people from mass-atrocity crimes when their own government fails to do so . 
It comes down to personal dignity . 
Future generations , too , deserve personal dignity - including that afforded by a clean and healthy environment . 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has emphasized personal dignity in the discussions leading to the adoption of the SDGs , even asking Pope Francis to address the General Assembly on the subject at its next meeting . 
So what exactly is on the next development agenda ? 
Fulfilling this ambitious agenda will require realistic and effective evaluation mechanisms that help reveal the best policies and keep countries &quot; efforts on track . 
According to the draft agenda , the monitoring procedures will be directed by individual countries , so that each government can tailor them according to national priorities . 
But it is up to the international community to ensure that all governments establish specific goals and deadlines for meeting them . 
Without strong accountability mechanisms , the SDGs will amount to little more than an exercise in raising awareness , effectively subordinating the health , dignity , and prosperity of all humanity to short-term national interests . 
The upcoming SDG summit , which will bring together the largest concentration of heads of state and government in the history of the UN , presents the ideal opportunity to establish such mechanisms . 
The SDGs are extremely ambitious .
