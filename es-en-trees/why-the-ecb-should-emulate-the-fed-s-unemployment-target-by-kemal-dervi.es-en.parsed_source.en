Should Central Banks Target Employment ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - On December 12 , US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced that the Fed will keep interest rates at close to zero until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 % , provided inflation expectations remain subdued . 
While the Fed &apos;s governing statutes , unlike those of the European Central Bank , explicitly include a mandate to support employment , the announcement marked the first time that the Fed tied its interest-rate policy to a numerical employment target . 
It is a welcome breakthrough , and one that should be emulated by others - not least the ECB . 
Central banks &quot; statutes differ in terms of the objectives that they set for monetary policy . 
All include price stability . 
Many add a reference to general economic conditions , including growth and employment or financial stability . 
Some give the central bank the authority to set an inflation target unilaterally ; others stipulate coordination with the government in setting the target . 
There is no recent example , however , of a major central bank setting a numerical employment target . 
This should change , as the size of the employment challenge facing the advanced economies becomes more apparent . 
Weak labor markets , low inflation , and debt overhang suggest that a fundamental re-ordering of priorities is in order . 
In Japan , Shinzo Abe , the incoming prime minister , is signaling the same set of concerns , although he seems to be proposing a &quot; minimum &quot; inflation target for the Bank of Japan , rather than a link to growth or employment . 
The spread of global value-chains that integrate hundreds of millions of developing-country workers into the global economy , as well as new labor-saving technologies , imply little chance of cost-push wage inflation . 
Likewise , the market for long-term bonds indicates extremely low inflation expectations ( of course , interest rates are higher in cases of perceived sovereign default or re-denomination risk , such as in Southern Europe , but that has nothing to do with inflation ) . 
Moreover , the deleveraging underway since the 2008 financial implosion could be easier if inflation were moderately higher for a few years , a debate the International Monetary Fund encouraged a year ago . 
Together with these considerations , policymakers should take into account the tremendous human and economic costs of high unemployment , ranging from the millions of shattered lives , skills erosion , and disappearance of opportunities for an entire generation , to the dead-weight loss of idle human resources . 
Is the failure to ensure that millions of young people acquire the skills required to participate in the economy not as great a liability for a society as a large stock of public debt ? 
Nowhere is this reordering of priorities more needed than in the eurozone . 
Yet , strangely , it is the Fed , not the ECB , that has set an unemployment target . 
The US unemployment rate has declined to around 7.7 % and the current-account deficit is close to $ 500 billion , while eurozone unemployment is at a record high , near 12 % , and the current account shows a surplus approaching $ 100 billion . 
If the ECB &apos;s inflation target were 3 % , rather than close to but below 2 % , and Germany , with the world &apos;s largest current-account surplus , encouraged 6 % wage growth and tolerated 4 % inflation - implying modest real-wage growth in excess of expected productivity gains - the eurozone adjustment process would become less politically and economically costly . 
Indeed , the policy calculus in Northern Europe greatly underestimates the economic losses due to the disruptions imposed on the South by excessive austerity and wage deflation . 
The resulting high levels of youth unemployment , health problems , and idle production capacity also all have a substantial impact on demand for imports from the North . 
Contrary to conventional wisdom , the ECB &apos;s legal mandate would allow such a re-ordering of priorities , as , with reference to the ECB , the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that &quot; The primary ( emphasis added ) objective of the European System of Central Banks &amp; hellip ; shall be to maintain price stability , &quot; and there is another part of the Treaty dealing with general eurozone economic policies that emphasizes employment . 
This would seem not to preclude a temporary complementary employment objective for the ECB at a time of exceptional challenge . 
Moreover , the ECB has the authority to set the eurozone-wide inflation target , and could set it higher for two or three years , without any treaty violation . 
The real problem is the current political attitude in Germany . 
Somehow , the memory of hyperinflation in the early 1920 &quot; s seems scarier than that of massive unemployment in the early 1930 &quot; s , although it was the latter that fueled the rise of Nazism . 
Maybe the upcoming German elections will allow progressive forces to clarify what is at stake for Germany and Europe - indeed , the entire world . 
In a more global context , none of this is to dismiss the longer-term dangers of inflation . 
In most countries , at most times , inflation should be kept very low - and central banks should anchor inflation expectations with a stable long-term target , although the alternative of targeting nominal GDP deserves to be discussed . 
Moreover , monetary policy cannot be a long-term substitute for structural reforms and sustainable budgets . 
Long periods of zero real interest rates carry the danger of asset bubbles , misallocation of resources , and unintended effects on income inequality , as recent history - not least in the US and Japan - demonstrates . 
For the coming 2-3 years , however , particularly in Europe , the need for deleveraging , the costs of widespread joblessness , and the risk of social collapse make the kind of temporary unemployment target announced by the Fed highly desirable .
