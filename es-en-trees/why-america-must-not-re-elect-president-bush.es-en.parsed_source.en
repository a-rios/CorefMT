Why America Must Not Re-elect President Bush 
I have never been heavily involved in partisan politics , but these are not normal times . 
President George W. Bush is endangering the United States and the world &apos;s safety while undermining American values . 
For opposing him , I have been demonized by the Bush campaign . 
President Bush ran in 2000 on a platform promising a &quot; humble &quot; foreign policy . 
If re-elected , the Bush doctrine of preemptive action - and the invasion of Iraq - will be endorsed , and the world will have to live with the consequences . 
By repudiating Bush &apos;s policies at the polls , America will have a chance to regain the respect and support of the world . 
The terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , required a strong response . 
But they also led to suspension of the critical process so essential to a democracy - a full and fair discussion of the issues . 
Bush silenced criticism by calling it unpatriotic . 
For 18 months after 9 / 11 , he managed to suppress all dissent . 
That is how he led America in the wrong direction . 
In fact , Bush played right into the hands of Osama bin Laden . 
Afghanistan &apos;s invasion was justified : that was where bin Laden lived and al Qaeda had its training camps . 
Invading Iraq was not . 
It was Bush &apos;s unintended gift to bin Laden . 
Immediately after 9 / 11 , there was a spontaneous outpouring of sympathy for America worldwide . 
It has given way to widespread resentment . 
There are many more people willing to risk their lives to kill Americans than there were on September 11 . 
Bush likes to insist that terrorists hate Americans for what they are - a freedom loving people - not what they do . 
But war and occupation create innocent victims . 
We count the body bags of American soldiers - over 1,000 in Iraq . 
The wider world also counts the Iraqis who get killed daily , perhaps 20 times more . 
Nor was the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison the work of a few bad apples . 
It was part of a system of dealing with prisoners put in place by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld . 
Public opinion condemns America worldwide , and our troops in Iraq are paying the price . 
Bush convinced people that he is good for American security by playing on the fears generated by the 9 / 11 attacks . 
At a time of peril , people rally around the flag , and Bush exploited this by fostering a sense of danger . 
His campaign assumes that people do not really care about the truth and will believe almost anything if it is repeated often enough . 
There must be something wrong with Americans if we fall for it . 
For instance , some 40 % of Americans still believe that Saddam Hussein was connected with 9 / 11 , although the 9 / 11 Commission - set up by Bush and chaired by a Republican - definitively established that no such connection existed . 
I want to shout : &quot; Wake up America . 
Don &apos;t you realize we are being misled ? &quot; 
The war in Iraq was misconceived from start to finish - if it has a finish . 
It is a war of choice , not necessity . 
Moreover , America went to war on false pretenses . 
Weapons of mass destruction could not be found , and the connection with al Qaeda could not be established . 
Bush then claimed that America went to war to liberate Iraq . 
But democracy cannot be imposed by force . 
Saddam Hussein was a tyrant , and Iraqis - and the world - can rejoice in being rid of him . 
But America had an obligation to maintain law and order ; instead , we stood idly by while Baghdad and other cities were ransacked . 
If we had cared about the Iraqi people , we should have had more troops available for the occupation . 
We should have provided protection not only for the oil ministry , but also other ministries , museums , and hospitals . 
Worse still , when American soldiers encountered resistance , they employed methods - invading homes and mistreating prisoners - that alienated and humiliated the population , generating resentment and rage . 
The Bush administration &apos;s flip-flops and missteps are legion . 
First the Iraqi army was dissolved , then America tried to reconstitute it . 
First the US tried to eliminate the Baathists , then America turned to them for help . 
When the insurgency became intractable , America installed an Iraqi government . 
The man chosen to lead it was a protégé of the CIA with a reputation for being a strongman - a far cry from democracy . 
Despite the Bush campaign &apos;s efforts at spin control , the situation in Iraq is dire . 
Much of the western part of the country has been ceded to insurgents , the prospect of holding free and fair elections in January is fast receding , civil war looms . 
Bush &apos;s war in Iraq has done untold damage to America as well , impairing its military power and undermining the morale of the armed forces . 
Before the war , America could project overwhelming force . 
Not anymore . 
Afghanistan is slipping from control . 
North Korea , Iran , Pakistan , and other countries pursue nuclear programs with renewed vigor . 
The Bush administration can be criticized for many other policies , but none are as important as Iraq . 
The war has cost nearly $ 200 billion , and costs will continue to mount , because getting into Iraq was much easier than getting out will be . 
Bush has been taunting John Kerry to explain how he would do things differently . 
Kerry has responded that he would have done everything differently , and that he would be in a better position to extricate us . 
But it won &apos;t be easy for him , either , because America is caught in a quagmire . 
Top military and diplomatic experts desperately warned Bush not to invade Iraq . 
He ignored them . 
He suppressed the critical process , arguing that any criticism of the Commander-in-Chief puts US troops at risk . 
But this is Bush &apos;s war , and he ought to be held responsible for it . 
Americans should step back for a moment and ask : who got them into this mess ? 
A moment &apos;s reflection should raise another question : does Bush &apos;s Texas swagger qualify him to remain America &apos;s Commander-in-Chief ?
