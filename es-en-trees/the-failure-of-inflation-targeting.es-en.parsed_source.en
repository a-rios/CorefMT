The Failure of Inflation Targeting 
New York - The World &apos;s central bankers are a close-knit club , given to fads and fashions . 
In the early 1980 &quot; s , they fell under the spell of monetarism , a simplistic economic theory promoted by Milton Friedman . 
After monetarism was discredited - at great cost to those countries that succumbed to it - the quest began for a new mantra . 
The answer came in the form of &quot; inflation targeting , &quot; which says that whenever price growth exceeds a target level , interest rates should be raised . 
This crude recipe is based on little economic theory or empirical evidence ; there is no reason to expect that regardless of the source of inflation , the best response is to increase interest rates . 
One hopes that most countries will have the good sense not to implement inflation targeting ; my sympathies go to the unfortunate citizens of those that do . ( Among the list of those who have officially adopted inflation targeting in one form or another are : Israel , the Czech Republic , Poland , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , South Africa , Thailand , Korea , Mexico , Hungary , Peru , the Philippines , Slovakia , Indonesia , Romania , New Zealand , Canada , the United Kingdom , Sweden , Australia , Iceland , and Norway . ) 
Today , inflation targeting is being put to the test - and it will almost certainly fail . 
Developing countries currently face higher rates of inflation not because of poorer macro-management , but because oil and food prices are soaring , and these items represent a much larger share of the average household budget than in rich countries . 
In China , for example , inflation is approaching 8 % or more . 
In Vietnam , it is even higher and is expected to approach 18.2 % this year , and in India it is 5.8 % . 
By contrast , US inflation stands at 3 % . 
Does that mean that these developing countries should raise their interest rates far more than the US ? 
Inflation in these countries is , for the most part , imported . 
Raising interest rates won &apos;t have much impact on the international price of grains or fuel . 
Indeed , given the size of the US economy , a slowdown there might conceivably have a far bigger effect on global prices than a slowdown in any developing country , which suggests that , from a global perspective , US interest rates , not those in developing countries , should be raised . 
So long as developing countries remain integrated into the global economy - and do not take measures to restrain the impact of international prices on domestic prices - domestic prices of rice and other grains are bound to rise markedly when international prices do . 
For many developing countries , high oil and food prices represent a triple threat : not only do importing countries have to pay more for grain , they have to pay more to bring it to their countries and still more to deliver it to consumers who may live a long distance from ports . 
Raising interest rates can reduce aggregate demand , which can slow the economy and tame increases in prices of some goods and services , especially non-traded goods and services . 
But , unless taken to an intolerable level , these measures by themselves cannot bring inflation down to the targeted levels . 
For example , even if global energy and food prices increase at a more moderate rate than now - for example , 20 % per year - and get reflected in domestic prices , bringing the overall inflation rate to , say , 3 % would require markedly falling prices elsewhere . That would almost surely entail a marked economic slowdown and high unemployment . 
The cure would be worse than the disease . 
So , what should be done ? 
First , politicians , or central bankers , should not be blamed for imported inflation , just as we should not give them credit for low inflation when the global environment is benign . 
Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , it is now recognized , deserves much blame for America &apos;s current economic mess . 
He is also sometimes given credit for America &apos;s low inflation during his tenure . 
Second , we must recognize that high prices can cause enormous stress , especially for lower-income individuals . 
Riots and protests in some developing countries are just the worst manifestation of this . 
Advocates of trade liberalization touted its advantages ; but they were never fully honest about its risks , against which markets typically fail to provide adequate insurance . 
Over a quarter-century ago , I showed that , under plausible conditions , trade liberalization could make everyone worse off . 
I was not arguing for protectionism , but rather sounding a cautionary note that we must be aware of the downside risks and be prepared to deal with them . 
When it comes to agriculture , developed countries , such as the US and European Union members , insulate both consumers and farmers from these risks . 
But most developing countries do not have the institutional structures , or the resources , to do likewise . 
Many are imposing emergency measures like export taxes or bans , which help their own citizens , but at the expense of those elsewhere . 
If we are to avoid an even stronger backlash against globalization , the West must respond quickly and strongly . 
Bio-fuel subsidies , which have encouraged the shift of land from producing food into energy , must be repealed . 
In addition , some of the billions spent to subsidize Western farmers should now be spent to help poorer developing countries meet their basic food and energy needs . 
Most importantly , both developing and developed countries need to abandon inflation targeting . 
The struggle to meet rising food and energy prices is hard enough . 
The weaker economy and higher unemployment that inflation targeting brings won &apos;t have much impact on inflation ; it will only make the task of surviving in these conditions more difficult .
