China &apos;s Flawed Balance-of-Payments Position 
BEIJING - The balance-of-payments figures that China &apos;s State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( SAFE ) released in April should have triggered serious concern , if not alarm . 
The data adjusted China &apos;s investment-income deficit for 2011 from $ 26.8 billion to $ 85.3 billion - a massive revision that casts doubt on the reliability of China &apos;s balance-of-payments statistics and exposes a flaw in the economy &apos;s growth path . 
But few people seem to care . 
According to SAFE , as of February 2012 , China had accumulated $ 4.7 trillion in foreign assets through purchases of United States government securities and other investments , and more than $ 2.9 trillion in foreign liabilities through foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and borrowing . 
This puts China &apos;s net foreign assets at roughly $ 1.8 trillion . 
But , despite China &apos;s position as one of the world &apos;s largest creditors , its net investment-income balance is deeply negative . 
In fact , China has run investment-account deficits for six of the last nine years , with preliminary statistics suggesting a deficit of $ 57.4 billion in 2012 . 
Two factors explain this anomaly . 
The first is the high return on foreign investment in China . 
In 2008 , US corporations gained a 33 % return on their investments in China , while other multinationals got a 22 % return . 
By contrast , the return on US government securities , which form the bulk of China &apos;s foreign assets , was next to nothing . 
Second , China &apos;s foreign assets are denominated almost exclusively in US dollars , while its foreign liabilities are denominated mostly in renminbi . 
As a result , whenever the US dollar declines , China &apos;s net international-investment position ( the difference between its external financial assets and liabilities ) deteriorates - and so does its investment-income balance . 
China &apos;s drive for renminbi internationalization so far has made the balance-sheet structure even more unfavorable . 
According to the economist Geoffrey Crowther , a country &apos;s balance-of-payments position evolves in six stages , with the key variable being net assets - that is , the country &apos;s net international-investment position . 
In the first three stages , the country is a net borrower with a deficit on the investment-income account . 
As an &quot; immature debtor-borrower , &quot; its trade balance and current account are also in deficit ; as a &quot; mature debtor-borrower , &quot; its trade balance enters surplus ; and , as a &quot; debtor-repayer , &quot; its current account moves to surplus . 
In the later stages , the country becomes a net creditor , running an investment-income surplus . 
As an &quot; immature creditor-lender , &quot; the trade balance and current account are in surplus as well ; as a &quot; mature creditor-lender , &quot; the trade balance returns to deficit ; finally , as a &quot; creditor-borrower , &quot; the country &apos;s current account swings into deficit . 
A country in the later stages of development can use investment income from its past accumulation of net foreign assets to compensate for the decline in citizens &quot; incomes due to aging and other changes . 
China breaks Crowther &apos;s mold . 
Given that it has been running an investment-income deficit , a trade surplus , and current-account surplus , it seems that it should be classified as a &quot; debtor-repayer . &quot; 
But China is a net creditor . 
If China runs an investment-income deficit with net assets of almost $ 2 trillion , how will it make the transition to an investment-income surplus ? 
China &apos;s investment-income deficit will probably persist in the foreseeable future . 
Its stock of foreign capital will increase steadily as foreign firms invest and reinvest in China . 
FDI in the country will continue to garner substantial returns , partly owing to local-government hospitality . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s outward FDI will continue to encounter challenges , as various short- and long-term factors - from weak international demand to an aging population - cause its trade surplus to decline , diminishing its ability to export capital . 
China &apos;s investment in US government securities and other sovereign debt will continue to yield extremely low returns . 
In fact , this investment will never be repaid in full , so a large write-off is inevitable . 
The value of China &apos;s assets as future claims on real resources has already been diluted by dollar depreciation , and calls in the US for inflating away America &apos;s debt burden portend a further decline . 
Moreover , while China may have profited from the rise in government-bond prices over the last few years , prices have been inflated artificially by expansionary monetary policy in advanced countries , which implies that the bubble could burst . 
Whether through inflation or collapsing government-bond prices , China will suffer significant capital losses on its foreign assets , further damaging its investment-income balance . 
Without fundamental changes in its economic-growth pattern , it is difficult to imagine how China can become an immature creditor-lender and a mature creditor-lender . 
A more likely scenario is that China will continue to have a trade surplus ( though much smaller ) and an investment-income deficit , mirrored by America &apos;s trade deficit and investment-income surplus . 
If both countries have balanced current accounts , their balance-of-payments positions can be sustainable . 
In such a scenario , the US exports to China what Ricardo Hausmann and Federico Sturzenegger have dubbed &quot; dark matter &quot; ( unaccounted assets , such as knowledge , which US corporations export through their investments ) , while China exports consumer goods and services to the US . 
But would China be happy with this division of labor ? 
China &apos;s leaders should think hard about this question now - before it is too late to change the situation .
