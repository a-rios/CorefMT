Going to the Dogs 
GAINESVILLE , FLORIDA - There are about 70 million dogs living in human homes in the United States . 
The pattern in other Western nations is similar . 
Roughly 40 % of house dogs are allowed to sleep on their owners &quot; beds . 
How did dogs achieve such an intimate position in our lives ? 
One theory is that , in the thousands of years that dogs have lived with humans , they have become attuned to human ways of thinking . 
Certainly dogs have a remarkable sensitivity to human behavior . 
Dogs are able to follow human pointing gestures to find hidden food , and they can indicate successfully to their owners by their own pointing actions where a hidden toy is located . 
Under certain circumstances , dogs understand that a human who cannot see them ( because , for example , she is blindfolded ) is less likely to respond to begging with a tasty treat than a person whose vision is not obscured . 
Dogs are also more likely to obey a command to leave something desirable alone if their master stays in the room than if he steps out . 
And yet attempts to view canine smarts as cut from the same cloth as human intelligence gloss over a lot of the details about how dogs and humans operate . 
Evolution doesn &apos;t ever build the same form of intelligence twice - even though similar problems may lead to similar solutions . 
As most owners of puppies know , it takes time and care for a dog to learn the ways of humans . 
We don &apos;t literally raise our hackles when angry , or sniff each other &apos;s backsides when making new friends . 
And dogs don &apos;t gesture with their forepaws or use an elaborate grammatical language when trying to explain things . 
In our own research , we have found that people remain somewhat mysterious to dogs for the first five months of life , and dogs at our local pound lag considerably behind house dogs when it comes to understanding human beings . 
Recent research by Alexandra Horowitz at Barnard College in New York accentuates the &quot; talking past each other &quot; that sometimes goes on between humans and dogs . 
Horowitz asked owners to forbid their dogs to take a biscuit and then briefly leave the room . 
When the owners returned after a few moments away , some were told that their dogs had been naughty and eaten the forbidden food . 
Others were told their dog had been good and left the biscuit alone . 
If the dog had misbehaved , the owner was given a moment to berate his pet for its misdeed . 
The owners were then asked whether their dog looked guilty . 
The twist in this tale is that only half of the owners were correctly informed . 
Half of the time , Horowitz told the owner of a dog that had actually left the biscuit alone that his dog had taken the treat . 
And half the time the owner of a naughty dog was told that his dog had been good . 
The point of this deception was that when Horowitz asked each owner whether his dog looked guilty , she could consider whether the owner &apos;s report of &quot; guilty looks &quot; actually had to do with the facts of the matter - whether the dog had taken the forbidden treat - or whether it reflected nothing more than whether the owner had chastised his hound . 
The results showed very clearly that a dog &apos;s &quot; guilty looks &quot; came about solely because it was being scolded : the look had nothing to do with whether the dog had really committed an offense . 
This does not mean that we should not chastise our dogs ( or praise them ) . 
All it means is that , if we want to live harmoniously with another species in our most intimate places , we must recognize that some of the time our preferred modes of reasoning are not theirs . 
We must try to understand dogs on their own terms , and help them to understand us .
