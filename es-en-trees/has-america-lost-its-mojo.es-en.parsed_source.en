Has America Lost its Mojo ? 
Cambridge - You know that American self-confidence is shaken when even the President starts expressing fear that the financial crisis may turn out worse than the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s . 
George Bush is not alone in worrying that things might get a lot worse before they get better . 
A growing number of savvy business people are also starting to wonder whether the United States will be able to right its economy anytime soon . 
Professional forecasters are considerably more sanguine , with the consensus forecast for US growth in 2009 at around -1.5 % , after a similar contraction in the second half of 2008 . 
This would be a painful recession , but far short of the 10-15 % output drop normally associated with a full-blown depression . 
Of course , economic forecasters have generally been far too optimistic at every turn of late , so the public is understandably leery of their prognostications . 
Consensus forecasts do still seem optimistic . 
With its financial system on life support , housing prices continuing to plummet , and unemployment rising , the US economy is looking more vulnerable than it has at any time since the 1970 &quot; s , and perhaps since World War II . 
Still , it must be noted that negative output growth for more than two years is a relatively rare event , even in the aftermath of severe banking crises . 
Historical statistical relationships are perhaps cold comfort in a downturn that now seems so insidiously different from previous catastrophes . 
Japan may have taken what seemed like forever to recover from its 1990 &quot; s crisis , but it is an exception - the crisis occurred as the Japanese economy needed to restructure in the face of the huge challenges posed by China &apos;s emergence . 
The complete policy paralysis that has prevailed during the interregnum between Presidents Bush and Obama has not helped . 
US policy has devolved into a sort of &quot; wheel of fortune &quot; game for financial firms . 
One day you get bankruptcy , another day loans with few strings attached . 
One hopes that President-elect Obama &apos;s all-star economic team will at least adopt a coherent and consistent policy . 
Consistency alone would be a big boost for confidence . 
The basic elements of a recovery package include , first and foremost , a rational approach to rebooting the financial system . 
This means mark-to-market pricing of assets , restructuring and recapitalizing banks , and a new approach to regulation that allows creativity while better protecting the public against some of the madness that has prevailed for more than a decade . Help for housing is required to prevent overshooting in home prices , as is massive macroeconomic stimulus , including a moderately inflationary monetary policy . 
A number of leaders , most prominently German Chancellor Angela Merkel , are understandably worried about the longer-term consequences of aggressive macroeconomic stimulus . 
These concerns are valid , even more so given government &apos;s growing role in the economy . 
But , as in wartime , one hopes these effects are temporary . 
Besides , is inaction a real alternative ? 
Prior to the 1950 &quot; s , output drops of 15-20 % in a single year were routine ( admittedly , national income accounting was more primitive . ) 
Recessions have important cleansing effects , helping to facilitate painful restructuring . 
But today &apos;s social , economic , and political systems - at least in developed countries - are unable to withstand a peacetime decline in output of 15-20 % within a short period . 
Massive stimulus and intervention - the US Federal Reserve &apos;s current stance - is unavoidable . 
One can only hope that the state can get out of the economy half as fast as it is getting in . 
Nevertheless , the distinct possibility that stimulus and restructuring may work is further cause to hope that the deepening recession will not morph into a full-blown depression . 
The US may be ground zero for the global financial crisis , but it is not the only country riven by self-doubt . 
Britain , Ireland , and Spain each face financial crises of a similar magnitude . 
Some countries that depend on energy exports , particularly governance-challenged ones such as Russia and Venezuela , are experiencing even worse downturns . 
Even once-invulnerable China must contemplate a halving of its growth rate . 
Europe and Japan do not have quite as complex financial messes as the US . 
The global economy is in a pickle . 
But , just as optimists were too sanguine in the boom , ultra-pessimists probably go too far in forecasting a depression around the corner . 
Yet , absent a large-scale conflagration , there is a fair chance that 2010 will see a restoration of weak growth in the US , Europe , and Japan , and probably robust growth in most emerging markets . 
The US economy may have lost a fair chunk of its mojo , but it will require a lot more bad luck and policy blunders to get to a second worldwide Great Depression .
