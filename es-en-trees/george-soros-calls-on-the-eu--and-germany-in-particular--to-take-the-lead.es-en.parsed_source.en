Sustaining Ukraine &apos;s Breakthrough 
NEW YORK - Following a crescendo of terrifying violence , the Ukrainian uprising has had a surprisingly positive outcome . 
Contrary to all rational expectations , a group of citizens armed with not much more than sticks and shields made of cardboard boxes and metal garbage-can lids overwhelmed a police force firing live ammunition . 
There were many casualties , but the citizens prevailed . 
This was one of those historic moments that leave a lasting imprint on a society &apos;s collective memory . 
How could such a thing happen ? 
Quantum mechanics offers a fitting metaphor . 
Physicists know that subatomic phenomena can manifest themselves as both particles and waves ; similarly , human beings may behave both as individual particles and as components of a larger wave . 
In other words , the unpredictability of historical events like those in Ukraine has to do with an element of uncertainty in human identity . 
People &apos;s identity is made up of individual elements and elements of larger units to which they belong , and peoples &quot; impact on reality depends on which elements dominate their behavior . 
When civilians launched a suicidal attack on an armed force in Kyiv on February 20 , their sense of representing &quot; the nation &quot; far outweighed their concern with their individual mortality . 
The result was to swing a deeply divided society from the verge of civil war to an unprecedented sense of unity . 
Whether that unity endures will depend on how Europe responds . 
Ukrainians have demonstrated their allegiance to a European Union that is itself hopelessly divided , with the euro crisis pitting creditor and debtor countries against one another . 
That is why the EU was hopelessly outmaneuvered by Russia in the negotiations with Ukraine over an Association Agreement . 
True to form , the EU under German leadership offered far too little and demanded far too much from Ukraine . 
Now , after the Ukrainian people &apos;s commitment to closer ties with Europe fueled a successful popular insurrection , the EU , along with the International Monetary Fund , is putting together a multibillion-dollar rescue package to save the country from financial collapse . 
I established the Renaissance Foundation in Ukraine in 1990 - before the country achieved independence . 
The foundation did not participate in the recent uprising , but it did serve as a defender of those targeted by official repression . 
The foundation is now ready to support Ukrainians &quot; strongly felt desire to establish resilient democratic institutions ( above all , an independent and professional judiciary ) . 
In the remarkable transformation of Central Europe &apos;s economies in the 1990 &quot; s , management expertise and market access resulted from massive investments by German and other EU-based companies , which integrated local producers into their global value chains . 
Ukraine , with its high-quality human capital and diversified economy , is a potentially attractive investment destination . 
In addition to encouraging foreign direct investment , the EU could provide support to train local companies &quot; managers and help them develop their business strategies , with service providers remunerated by equity stakes or profit-sharing . 
An effective way to roll out such support to a large number of companies would be to combine it with credit lines provided by commercial banks . 
To encourage participation , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) could invest in companies alongside foreign and local investors , as it did in Central Europe . 
Ukraine would thus open its domestic market to goods manufactured or assembled by European companies &quot; wholly- or partly-owned subsidiaries , while the EU would increase market access for Ukrainian companies and help them integrate into global markets . 
I hope and trust that Europe under German leadership will rise to the occasion . 
I have been arguing for several years that Germany should accept the responsibilities and liabilities of its dominant position in Europe . 
Today , Ukraine needs a modern-day equivalent of the Marshall Plan , by which the United States helped to reconstruct Europe after World War II . 
Germany ought to play the same role today as the US did then . 
I must , however , end with a word of caution . 
The Marshall Plan did not include the Soviet bloc , thereby reinforcing the Cold War division of Europe . 
A replay of the Cold War would cause immense damage to both Russia and Europe , and most of all to Ukraine , which is situated between them . 
Ukraine depends on Russian gas , and it needs access to European markets for its products ; it must have good relations with both sides . 
Here , too , Germany should take the lead . 
Chancellor Angela Merkel must reach out to President Vladimir Putin to ensure that Russia is a partner , not an opponent , in the Ukrainian renaissance .
