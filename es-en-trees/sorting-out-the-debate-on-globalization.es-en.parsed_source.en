Sorting out the Debate on Globalization 
CAMBRIDGE : Confusion reigns supreme in the heated debate on globalization . 
For some , globalization is the road to prosperity for poor countries , and it certainly seems that countries such as Singapore , Taiwan , Korea , Chile and a few others have gotten much richer in the past 25 years through an economic strategy based on export growth and participation in the global economy . 
For others , globalization is a curse under which poor countries are bound to fall further and further behind . 
There is little doubt that after twenty years of IMF and World Bank programs in Africa , those countries are still mired in poverty , with little benefit to show from all of those Washington-inspired programs . 
So who &apos;s right in this debate which has spilled into the streets of Seattle , Washington , and now Prague , during the cycle of international economics meetings in the past year ? 
The answer , of course , is that life is more complicated than the contrasting positions of globalization as panacea or curse . 
Different parts of the world face different kinds of challenges . 
For some , globalization is a pretty reliable ticket to success ; for others , it will have little effect by itself , since the most pressing social and economic crises hitting those countries can &apos;t be solved by free trade or market reforms alone . 
First , some countries are heavily burdened by their physical geography . 
These countries are not much helped by globalization . 
They are , in general , stuck in poverty and economic isolation . 
For them , globalization is not a curse , but it is hardly a solution . 
Globalization also does little to eliminate the high incidence of disease linked to tropical climate . 
In parts of Nigeria , a person can expect to be bitten by an infective mosquito carrying malaria up to 300 times in a year , while I am pretty much assured that no mosquito will give me malaria in Boston . 
Africans suffer about 500 million cases of malaria per year , causing around 2 million deaths . 
Malaria can destroy economic growth and hinder foreign investment just as much as war or economic mismanagement . 
Second , national development strategies matter a lot . 
Countries that deliberately avoided world markets through heavy protectionism lost out in the past twenty years . 
Countries that chose socialism all went bankrupt . 
Export-led growth has proved to be necessary for economic development for the simple reason that countries need to purchase technology from world markets ( much of it in the form of high-tech machinery ) , and they can afford to do so only if they are generating sufficient export earnings . 
But free trade is not enough . 
In today &apos;s knowledge economy , the countries that are the biggest success stories are basing their development not only on export growth but also on major investments in science and technology , and higher education . 
A full development strategy therefore requires a combination of globalization with sufficient public investment . 
Many of the protesters at the IMF , World Bank , and WTO meetings have been ill informed about the potential benefits of world markets , but they have been absolutely right about the politics of globalization . 
Many countries are clearly not benefiting from globalization , and are falling further and further behind into extreme poverty . 
The protesters have also understood that , despite repeated promises of financial help , debt cancellation , and support for disease control , the rich countries - and the IMF and World Bank , which the rich countries control - have done very little to help . 
We therefore need a new strategy for globalization that ensures that much more of the world will benefit from the expansion of world markets . 
The rich countries should help the poor countries to overcome the burdens of their geography by helping to fund a major fight against as AIDS , malaria , and other tropical infectious diseases . 
The rich countries can do vastly more to assist the poor countries in becoming a part of the information-technology revolution . 
They should also help support scientists and universities in the poor countries that will be the key to finding technological solutions to the deepest challenges of disease , low agricultural productivity , and environmental degradation facing the poorest peoples of the world . 
Just tens of dollars per person per year would generate tens of billions of dollars of increased foreign assistance and make a profound difference in the quality of life , and in the benefits of globalization , for the world &apos;s poorest people .
