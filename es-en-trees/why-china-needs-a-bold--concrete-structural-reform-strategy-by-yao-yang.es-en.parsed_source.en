China &apos;s Reform Anxiety 
BEIJING - Since 2010 , global financial circles have been obsessing about China &apos;s slowing economy . 
But , while the country barely met the official target of 7.5 % annual GDP growth in the second quarter of this year - generating significant anxiety worldwide - China &apos;s government seemingly remains calm , showing no indication that it plans to launch yet another stimulus package . 
Do China &apos;s leaders really have the situation under control ? 
In fact , the Chinese government &apos;s stance - based on Premier Li Keqiang &apos;s &quot; Likonomics , &quot; which prioritizes structural reform over rapid GDP growth - will prove to be in the best interests of China and the rest of the world . 
China &apos;s structural problems - including restrictions on labor mobility , a rigid and risk-laden financial system , and excessive reliance on government investment - are threatening its stability and economic development . 
Given that China &apos;s GDP growth rate remains respectable relative to the rest of the world , the need to emphasize structural reform is clear . 
But , despite well-intentioned statements and narrow gestures , China &apos;s new leadership has yet to establish a concrete , bold reform plan capable of resolving the economy &apos;s deep-rooted problems . 
For example , last February , the State Council announced plans to reform the hukou ( household registration ) system , which assigns legal residency according to a person &apos;s place of birth . 
The system makes relocating very difficult , as those who do not manage to acquire local residency permits face major hurdles in gaining access to public services when they migrate to other provinces . 
Indeed , their children are even prohibited from taking college entrance exams . 
The reform plan was supposed to improve the situation by allowing migrants in towns and small cities to acquire local residency permits more freely , while easing the requirements in medium-sized cities . 
But efforts to reform the system have been met with strong resistance , especially from local governments and residents , who fear the strain that unregulated migration to their cities will have on resources , employment , and services . 
As a result , a genuine hukou reform strategy remains elusive . 
Similarly , the government has been slow to formulate and implement effective financial-market reforms . 
Hopes were high early this year , when the State Council announced a strategy aimed at liberalizing the capital account , establishing a more flexible exchange-rate policy , and opening the financial sector to domestic private capital . 
But the government then heeded influential economists &quot; warnings of the risks of relaxing capital controls too hastily . 
In fact , the opposite should be happening . 
Narrow policies like the government &apos;s recent credit tightening will make it difficult to direct financial resources to the real economy - one of the primary objectives of &quot; Likonomics . &quot; 
Genuine progress depends on Chinese leaders &quot; willingness to address the structural flaws - namely , the restrictions on domestic private capital - that are impeding the financial system &apos;s ability to channel savings to the most promising economic sectors . 
Despite several rounds of deregulation , it remains very difficult to establish private banks in China , and rules on non-banking financial institutions are often unclear . 
As a result , shadow banking , which provides capital at triple the cost implied by the official base interest rate , is flourishing - and generating significant uncertainty and risk . 
Although the government recently attempted to attract capital back to the official banking sector by eliminating the lending rate &apos;s lower bound , more substantial reform is needed - and that will likely have to wait until the interest rate on deposits is fully liberalized and the financial sector is open to private banks . 
In many other areas , too , China &apos;s government either remains indecisive or is offering only rhetoric and small gestures . 
For example , the devolution of some project-approval powers to local governments will not solve the underlying problem of excessive state intervention in the economy ; on the contrary , it may even enhance the state &apos;s role by giving local governments more freedom to carry out investment projects . 
China &apos;s leaders know what is wrong with the country &apos;s economy . 
But , as their efforts over the last several months have highlighted , they are uncertain as to how to go about fixing it - a fact that is generating significant anxiety in financial markets and among the general public . 
As senior Chinese officials gather for their annual summer meeting in Beidaihe , a coastal resort near Beijing , they must recognize the need for a bold plan for genuine structural reform . 
Otherwise , anxiety will eventually give rise to mistrust , making a comprehensive reform strategy even more difficult to implement .
