The Politics of Economic Stupidity 
NEW YORK - In 2014 , the world economy remained stuck in the same rut that it has been in since emerging from the 2008 global financial crisis . 
Despite seemingly strong government action in Europe and the United States , both economies suffered deep and prolonged downturns . 
The gap between where they are and where they most likely would have been had the crisis not erupted is huge . 
In Europe , it increased over the course of the year . 
Developing countries fared better , but even there the news was grim . 
The most successful of these economies , having based their growth on exports , continued to expand in the wake of the financial crisis , even as their export markets struggled . 
But their performance , too , began to diminish significantly in 2014 . 
In 1992 , Bill Clinton based his successful campaign for the US presidency on a simple slogan : &quot; It &apos;s the economy , stupid . &quot; 
From today &apos;s perspective , things then do not seem so bad ; the typical American household &apos;s income is now lower . 
But we can take inspiration from Clinton &apos;s effort . 
The malaise afflicting today &apos;s global economy might be best reflected in two simple slogans : &quot; It &apos;s the politics , stupid &quot; and &quot; Demand , demand , demand . &quot; 
The near-global stagnation witnessed in 2014 is man-made . 
It is the result of politics and policies in several major economies - politics and policies that choked off demand . 
In the absence of demand , investment and jobs will fail to materialize . 
It is that simple . 
Nowhere is this clearer than in the eurozone , which has officially adopted a policy of austerity - cuts in government spending that augment weaknesses in private spending . 
The eurozone &apos;s structure is partly to blame for impeding adjustment to the shock generated by the crisis ; in the absence of a banking union , it was no surprise that money fled the hardest-hit countries , weakening their financial systems and constraining lending and investment . 
In Japan , one of the three &quot; arrows &quot; of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s program for economic revival was launched in the wrong direction . 
The fall in GDP that followed the increase in the consumption tax in April provided further evidence in support of Keynesian economics - as if there was not enough already . 
The US introduced the smallest dose of austerity , and it has enjoyed the best economic performance . 
But even in the US , there are roughly 650,000 fewer public-sector employees than there were before the crisis ; normally , we would have expected some two million more . 
As a result , the US , too , is suffering , with growth so anemic that wages remain basically stagnant . 
Much of the growth deceleration in emerging and developing countries reflects China &apos;s slowdown . 
China is now the world &apos;s largest economy ( in terms of purchasing power parity ) , and it has long been the main contributor to global growth . 
But China &apos;s remarkable success has bred its own problems , which should be addressed sooner rather than later . 
The Chinese economy &apos;s shift from quantity to quality is welcome - almost necessary . 
And , though President Xi Jinping &apos;s fight against corruption may cause economic growth to slow further , as paralysis grips public contracting , there is no reason for Xi to let up . 
On the contrary , other forces undermining trust in his government - widespread environmental problems , high and rising levels of inequality , and private-sector fraud - need to be addressed with equal vigor . 
In short , the world should not expect China to shore up global aggregate demand in 2015 . 
If anything , there will be an even bigger hole to fill . 
Meanwhile , in Russia , we can expect Western sanctions to slow growth , with adverse effects on an already weakened Europe . 
( This is not an argument against sanctions : The world had to respond to Russia &apos;s invasion of Ukraine , and Western CEOs who argue otherwise , seeking to protect their investments , have demonstrated a disturbing lack of principle . ) 
For the past six years , the West has believed that monetary policy can save the day . 
The crisis led to huge budget deficits and rising debt , and the need for deleveraging , the thinking goes , means that fiscal policy must be shunted aside . 
The problem is that low interest rates will not motivate firms to invest if there is no demand for their products . 
Nor will low rates inspire individuals to borrow to consume if they are anxious about their future ( which they should be ) . 
What monetary policy can do is create asset-price bubbles . 
It might even prop up the price of government bonds in Europe , thereby forestalling a sovereign-debt crisis . 
But it is important to be clear : the likelihood that loose monetary policies will restore global prosperity is nil . 
This brings us back to politics and policies . 
Demand is what the world needs most . 
The private sector - even with the generous support of monetary authorities - will not supply it . 
But fiscal policy can . 
We have an ample choice of public investments that would yield high returns - far higher than the real cost of capital - and that would strengthen the balance sheets of the countries undertaking them . 
The big problem facing the world in 2015 is not economic . 
We know how to escape our current malaise . 
The problem is our stupid politics .
