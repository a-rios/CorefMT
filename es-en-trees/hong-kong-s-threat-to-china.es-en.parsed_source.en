Hong Kong \ u0027s Threat to China 
Last month &apos;s massive demonstrations in Hong Kong , when over half a million residents poured into the streets in protest against the government of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa , continues to echo . 
Never in Hong Kong &apos;s history has popular opposition - uniting investment bankers , street hawkers , off-duty civil servants , and artists , among others - been so loud . 
China &apos;s communist rulers are dithering about how to respond . 
One objective of the demonstrators was to voice their desire to select Hong Kong &apos;s future leaders through universal suffrage . 
Today , 800 electors handpicked by the mainland Chinese government  -  who mostly represent big business  -  choose Hong Kong &apos;s Chief Executive . 
The unpopularity of Hong Kong &apos;s incompetent and sycophantic Chief Executive , chosen by China for a second five-year term that will only end in 2007 , creates a grave dilemma for the country &apos;s communist rulers . 
Before July &apos;s protests , they hoped that Hong Kong would provide so attractive an example of the idea of &quot; One Country , Two Systems &quot; that Taiwan would be lured into accepting the sovereignty of the government in Beijing . 
Now Taiwan &apos;s leaders point to Hong Kong as a failed model of a flawed concept . 
Indeed , Mr Tung &apos;s anticipatory subservience to the real or imagined wishes of China &apos;s rulers exposed the congenital flaw in the political architecture of uniting a liberal society with a dictatorship . 
That flaw infects the heart of the &quot; One Country , Two Systems &quot; notion : the idea that genuine autonomy can exist in a country whose supreme leaders do not believe in rule by consent . 
Now China &apos;s communist rulers find themselves trapped in a bind . 
If they back Tung unconditionally for the rest of his term , they can look forward to the collapse of their long-term strategy to re-absorb Taiwan , for the alternative to peaceful reunification with Taiwan is coercion . 
But any resort to coercion increases the likelihood of military confrontation with the US , Taiwan &apos;s protector . 
In this context , the steady build-up of China &apos;s short- to medium-range missile capability is a cause for alarm , such missiles being the principle threat against Taiwan . 
As the US Defense Department &apos;s &quot; Annual Report on the Military Power of the People &apos;s Republic of China &quot; recently put it , &quot; The primary driving force for China &apos;s military modernization is Beijing &apos;s perceived need to prepare credible military options in any potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait . &quot; 
Such a nightmare scenario isn &apos;t at all likely in Hong Kong , but a steady rot of Hong Kong &apos;s vitality is . 
For if the frustrations of ordinary Hong Kong citizens are allowed to fester without a genuine commitment by China to allow for universal suffrage by 2007 , a far more serious eruption of social and political unrest beckons . 
Such frustrations are growing . 
Unemployment now stands at 9 %  - unimaginable before the handover in 1997 , when both Tung and China promised that Hong Kong would do even better under Chinese sovereignty than under British rule . 
In fact , many observers believe that Hong Kong &apos;s real rate of joblessness is much higher , and fear that the trend is not encouraging . 
China &apos;s leaders , and their handpicked servants in Hong Kong may still believe that Tung &apos;s popularity will revive if and when the economy does . 
So they comfort themselves with the thought that demands for democratization reflect Hong Kong &apos;s economic woes , nothing more . 
But six years of divisive as well as dismissively haughty misrule by Tung &apos;s administration , which pits one group against another as its preferred method of governance , suggest that Hong Kong &apos;s problems are much deeper . 
Hong Kong is now an acrimoniously divided society harking back to the days when Chinese communists routinely classified their own citizens as either &quot; the people &quot; or &quot; enemies of the state . &quot; Most of Hong Kong &apos;s people now recognize that their stagnating economy is not merely a matter of bad policy . 
It also results from deeply flawed political structures . 
In an oligarchic economy such of that of today &apos;s Hong Kong , the costs of stagnation and the fruits of growth are distributed in grossly unfair ways . 
This cynical structure must be changed if people are to have enough confidence in the future for the economy to recover . 
If China &apos;s rulers heed the wishes of Hong Kong &apos;s seven million people to have the right to elect their own leaders through direct elections , however , they face the prospect that China &apos;s 1.3 billion people will demand the same right . 
Perhaps so . 
But a political system is only ever truly put at risk when leaders consistently misrule . 
Indeed , democracies are so stable because they allow misrule to be ended through regularly scheduled elections . 
Because stability is their great goal , China &apos;s communist rulers , if they are wise , will allow Hong Kong to show the way to a system in which Chinese govern themselves democratically , peacefully , and prosperously . 
Taiwan has already done so . 
Hong Kong , linked physically to the mainland , provides a more intimate case study for China &apos;s people to watch and one day follow . 
But if the goal is merely for the communists to retain their monopoly on power , in both Hong Kong and China , then the rot that has settled into Hong Kong &apos;s polity and its economy may begin to infect the mainland . 
At that point , China might wish it had never heard of Tung Chee-hwa . 
Indeed , it might wish it had never secured Hong Kong &apos;s return .
