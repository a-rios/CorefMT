The Dark Underbelly of Finance 
CHICAGO - If you thought that America &apos;s financial sector had gotten enough of bad publicity , think again . 
The insider-trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam , a billionaire hedge-fund manager , has now begun . 
It is likely to provide an especially lurid expos√© of the corrupt underbelly of the financial world . 
Rajaratnam &apos;s trial is remarkable in many ways . 
First , it is one of the few insider-trading cases ever to be brought against a professional hedge-fund manager . 
Historically , both state and federal attorney generals have preferred to prosecute &quot; occasional &quot; traders , who stick out like a sore thumb . 
For example , when a tiny Italian bank received from someone who never traded a large order for shares of US Shoe shortly before the company was acquired by Italian eyewear maker Luxottica , it was not difficult to smell a fish . 
In other words , precisely because occasional traders trade rarely , it is much easier to prove the nexus of causality between their trades and an illegal tip . 
By contrast , it is much more difficult to identify a problem when a person makes hundreds of trades every day . 
In Rajaratnam &apos;s case , the possibility of establishing such a link has come through telephone surveillance . 
This is the trial &apos;s second remarkable aspect : it is the first insider-trading case to rely on an instrument generally reserved for pursuing drug or mafia cases . 
When the contents of these conversations are revealed in court , they will not allay the public &apos;s already considerable distrust of the financial sector , to say the least . 
But the most remarkable aspect of this case is the level of the people involved . 
Past insider-trading prosecutions of people other than occasional traders usually involved rogue financiers , like Ivan Boesky in the 1980 &quot; s . 
This time , we are talking about the very heart of corporate America . 
A managing director of McKinsey , Anil Kumar , has already pled guilty to providing inside information to Rajaratnam in exchange for cash payments of at least $ 1.75 million . 
Raja Gupta , McKinsey &apos;s worldwide managing director for nine years , is accused of being one of the conspirators , as is Rajiv Goel , a managing director of Intel . 
It is so difficult to imagine that successful executives would jeopardize their careers and reputations in this way that many of us probably hope that the accusations turn out to be without merit . 
This research shows that portfolio managers place larger bets on firms that have directors who are their college friends and acquaintances , earning an 8 % excess annual return . 
A benign interpretation of these results is that college mates know each other better ; thus , a portfolio manager has an advantage in judging the quality of the CEO if they spent time with him or her in college . 
After ten weeks of a trial like this , it will be easy for the public to conclude that all hedge funds are crooked , and that the system is rigged against the outsiders . 
Fortunately , this is not the case . 
While there are certainly some rotten apples in the hedge-fund industry , the majority of traders behave properly , and their legitimate research contributes to making the market more efficient . 
Nevertheless , it will be difficult for legitimate hedge-fund managers to remove the taint that rogue traders have now spread over their industry . 
One way to do this is to be proactive in their disclosure . 
Hedge funds should publicly report all past trades that are at least two years old . 
Such delayed disclosure would not weaken their competitiveness , since the half-life of most trading strategies is very short , but it would give them the credibility that comes with having nothing to hide . 
Voluntary public disclosure by hedge funds could also prevent a much stronger regulatory intervention that might otherwise cling to the alarming headlines generated by Rajaratnam &apos;s trial .
