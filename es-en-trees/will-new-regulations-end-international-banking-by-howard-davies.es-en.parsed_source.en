Bankers with Borders 
LONDON - When Mark Carney replaces Mervyn King as Governor of the Bank of England in July 2013 , the world will be deprived of King &apos;s witty public utterances . 
My personal favorite came when , commenting on strong retail-sales figures during one Christmas period , he cast doubt on their significance for assessing the state of the economy . 
&quot; The true meaning of the story of Christmas &quot; he solemnly intoned , &quot; will not be revealed until Easter , or possibly much later . &quot; 
A new career on the stage , or in the pulpit , surely beckons . 
King &apos;s most quoted phrase is that &quot; global banking institutions are global in life , but national in death . &quot; 
They trade globally , across porous borders , attaching little significance to the geographical location of capital and liquidity . 
But , when the music stops , it is the home regulator , and the home central bank , that picks up the tab , even if the losses were incurred elsewhere . 
By the same token , a failing bank may leave behind a mess in third countries , which its home authorities may not clean up . 
Icelandic banks , for example , took deposits in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , and swept them back to Reykjavik , leaving the host countries out of pocket . 
Likewise , the collapse of Lehman Brothers left European creditors more exposed than those in the US , whose funds had been wired home to New York on the Friday before the end . 
Regulators have been wrestling with this problem for years , without conspicuous success . 
In mid-December , the Bank of England ( BoE ) and the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) announced what seemed like a breakthrough , at least concerning the major banks headquartered in the US or the UK - that is , 12 of the 28 institutions regarded by the Financial Stability Board as globally systemic . 
In their case , a resolution authority , in London or Washington , would take control of the parent company , remove senior management , and apportion losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors . 
It sounded plausible . 
BoE officials declared firmly that they were prepared to trust their American counterparts , and would not step in to grab subsidiaries or assets based in the UK . 
&quot; This is a journey that involves trust , &quot; said BoE Deputy Governor Paul Tucker . 
But the Anglo-American love-in quickly soured when the FDIC chairman was asked to give the same assurances of confidence in the British authorities . 
According to the Financial Times , he &quot; laughingly declined . &quot; 
Indeed , while the FDIC and the BoE were working on their plan , the US Federal Reserve was developing proposals that will expose overseas banks in the US to a far tighter set of controls , and closer supervision , than they have hitherto experienced . 
The Fed is seeking to oblige foreign banks to create a holding company to own their separately capitalized subsidiaries , effectively giving the Fed direct oversight of their business . 
They will also be required to maintain stronger capital and liquidity positions in the US . 
The justification offered for these new impositions is that overseas banks have moved beyond their traditional lending business to engage in substantial and often complex capital-market activities . 
&quot; The crisis revealed the resulting risks to US financial stability , &quot; said Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo . 
The UK &apos;s Financial Services Authority has been invoking the same rationale for requiring foreign banks to establish local subsidiaries , rather than taking deposits or lending through a branch of the parent bank . 
On the face of it , these moves appear to be well justified , given the mayhem created by poorly regulated banks in the major financial centers . 
But we should be clear that these changes are not just tinkering at the edges . 
They amount to a reversal of decades of policy by American and British regulators . 
Ernest Patrikis , a former Fed supervisor , points to the clear implication that in the US domestic banks will have a strong advantage over foreign banks . 
More dramatically , he asserts that &quot; subsidiarization would be the end of international banking . &quot; 
Larry Fink , the CEO of the multinational investment-management firm BlackRock , takes a similar view : &quot; It really throws into question &#91; the &#93; whole globalization of these firms , &quot; with &quot; each country for &#91; itself &#93; . &quot; 
He adds : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t call it a trade war , but I would certainly call it a high level of protectionism . &quot; 
One delicious irony in Europe is that Chinese banks are contesting the requirement to subsidiarize in London on precisely those grounds . 
For now , high-octane worries about protectionism are probably overdone . 
And it is difficult to deny that the Fed should take a close interest in the funding strategies of foreign banks operating in the US . 
Another Fed governor , Jeremy Stein , has pointed out that foreign banks have dollar liabilities of roughly $ 8 trillion , much of it short-term wholesale funding . 
But there is a risk that these interventions are the thin end of a dangerous wedge . 
Forced subsidiarization causes capital and liquidity to be trapped in local legal entities , reducing the effectiveness with which that capital is used . 
At a time when bank capital is scarce , that impediment carries significant economic costs . 
Moreover , tools that may be used wisely and well by institutions with a global outlook , like the Fed and the Bank of England , could take on a different character in countries where a commitment to free and open markets cannot be taken for granted . 
So we must hope that the US and British authorities move carefully and do not use their new powers to freeze out foreign competition . 
&quot; Be careful what you wish for &quot; is wise advice in the regulatory world , as it is elsewhere .
