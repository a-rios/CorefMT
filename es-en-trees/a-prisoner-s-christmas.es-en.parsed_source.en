A Prisoner &apos;s Christmas 
LUKYANIVSKA PRISON , KYIV - It has been said that there are no atheists in a foxhole . 
Here , after my show trial and four and a half months in a cell , I have discovered that there are no atheists in prison , either . 
When , despite unbearable pain , you are interrogated - including in your cell - for dozens of hours without a break , and an authoritarian regime &apos;s entire system of coercion , including its media , is trying to discredit and destroy you once and for all , prayer becomes the only intimate , trusting , and reassuring conversation that one can have . 
God , one realizes , is one &apos;s only friend and only available family , because - deprived even of access to a trusted priest - there is no one else in whom to confide one &apos;s worries and hopes . 
In this season of love and family , the loneliness of a prison cell is almost unbearable . 
The gray , dead silence of night ( guards peer in voyeuristically through a slot in the door ) , the sudden , disembodied shrieks of prisoners , shrieks of distress and rage , the distant rattles and clangs of prison bolts : all make sleep impossible , or so restless as to be a torment . 
But what is strange is that your senses are not dulled by this dead and dreadful world . 
On the contrary , they are ignited by it : your mind is set free from mundane concerns to ponder the inestimable and your place within it - a freedom of spirit that is a truly unexpected gift this Christmas season . 
In the cell &apos;s darkness , I gather strength and hope from the fact that God somehow seems so near to me here . 
For where else would Christ be but with those who suffer and are persecuted ? 
Indeed , I have recently been reading Dietrich Bonhoeffer &apos;s sublime and challenging Letters from Prison , in which he yearns for a Christ capable of offering mercy to a world , our world , then in the process of being martyred for a single man . 
Written in a cramped , dank , and putrid cell , where hope was meant to die before the body , Bonhoeffer crafted a book rich in faith , openness , possibility , and , yes , hope - even in humanity &apos;s darkest hour . 
One particular passage resonates with me as I contemplate Ukraine &apos;s plight . 
As he awaited his approaching execution by the Nazis , Bonhoeffer wrote that , in prison , &quot; the godlessness of the world is not ... concealed but , rather , revealed , and is thus exposed to an unexpected light . &quot; 
So I take some comfort this Christmas in knowing that the godlessness , inhumanity , and criminality of the regime that is now ruling in Kyiv is , at long last , being exposed to the world in a clear light . 
Its democratic posturing has been unmasked as cynical political theater , its claim to desire a European future for Ukraine &apos;s people revealed to be a lie , and the rapaciousness of its kleptocrats has been laid bare . 
The regime &apos;s contempt for the constitution and the rule of law is now undeniable , and that clarity is empowering . 
More importantly , the suffering of Ukraine &apos;s people has also become more widely known , and we are no longer so alone in our plight . 
Alleviating it has been embraced as a just cause across Europe and around the world . 
The everyday oppression , stifled media , and shakedowns and extortion of businesses for bribes all point to a mafia state on Europe &apos;s border . 
Now our European friends can no longer deny the smug vileness of the regime with which they are forced to deal . 
And I am thankful this Christmas for being able to believe that democratic Europe will not tolerate this state of affairs . 
Ukrainians will be strong knowing that they are not alone in their fight . 
I do not pretend to be an expert on religious faith and spiritual values . 
I am only a believer who cannot accept that our existence is the result of some freak cosmic accident . 
We are , I believe , part of a mysterious yet integral act , whose source , direction , and purpose , though difficult to grasp at times , does have meaning and purpose - even when one is confined behind prison bars . 
It is only faith in the idea that our lives matter , and that our decisions must be judged by their moral content , that we in Ukraine , and elsewhere , will be able to find our way out of the misery , unhappiness , and despair that has consumed us over the last two years . 
It is within our power to recover or reinvigorate our freedoms and our societies , not by individual efforts , but by joining forces with likeminded people all over the world . 
I know that we will manage this . 
This Christmas , I ask my family and friends everywhere not to worry about me . 
As Anna Akhmatova , the great poetic chronicler of Stalin &apos;s terror , said , &quot; I am alive in this grave . &quot; 
Indeed , I am more alive , I know , than the men who have imprisoned me here . 
Christmas is meant to mark the possibility of a new beginning for all men and women . 
As Bonhoeffer affirmed with his last words : &quot; This is for me ... the beginning of life . &quot;
