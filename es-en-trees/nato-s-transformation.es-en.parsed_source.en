NATO \ u0027s Transformation 
Can NATO play a role in the struggle against international terrorism ? 
Will the Atlantic Alliance be able to defend our safety and security in a radically altered strategic environment ? 
Next week , NATO heads of state and government will answer these questions with an unequivocal &quot; yes . &quot; 
The months since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington have been characterized by intense transatlantic debate . 
No holds were barred . 
Some Americans argued that the US no longer needed allies . 
Some Europeans argued that the US was irreversibly bent on unilateralism . 
Both views are wrong , and the Prague NATO summit will demonstrate why . 
The summit will bring home to even the greatest skeptics that when it comes to managing our long-term security , there is no alternative to Europe and North America acting together . 
Tackling Terrorism : The events of September 11 th , 2001 clearly invalidated the conventional wisdom that terrorists want a lot of people watching , not a lot of people dead . 
Once a largely domestic concern , terrorism has become a major threat to international security . 
This is why NATO will help tackle terrorism . 
The invocation of NATO &apos;s collective self-defense obligation on September 12 th , 2001 was only the beginning . 
A new NATO military concept for defense against terrorism will now follow , supported by the development of specific counter-terrorism capabilities . 
We will further increase our cooperation in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and in dealing with the consequences should prevention fail . 
In short , NATO will become the focus for coordinating and planning the multinational military contribution to our defense against terrorism and other new threats . 
Enhancing Military Capabilities : Military capability is the crucial underpinning of our safety and security . 
It translates directly into political credibility . 
But we need capabilities that are different from those needed during the Cold War . 
We need forces that react more quickly , reach further , and can remain in the field longer . 
Enhancing NATO &apos;s capabilities will thus prove to be the litmus test for the future of the Alliance . 
NATO will pass this test . 
A new NATO Response Force will bring together the most advanced forces within the Alliance for taking ultra-quick action against new security threats . 
We will address shortfalls in our military posture through specific national commitments . 
Re-prioritization , less duplication , and better armaments cooperation are further steps that will ensure that the Alliance retains its military edge . 
We will also see to it that our efforts tie in with steps by the European Union to bolster its military capabilities . 
Inviting New Members : The venue of the Prague summit - the capital of one of NATO &apos;s most recent member states - is a powerful symbol of the Alliance &apos;s success in advancing Europe &apos;s unification . 
But this job is not yet complete . 
That is why , at Prague , we will invite additional countries to join . 
This will end Europe &apos;s Cold War division for good and foreclose any return to the darker chapters of the continent &apos;s past . 
Admission of new members will repeat the positive experience of the last enlargement round . 
Countries that will receive invitations to join NATO during the Prague Summit will have had years of experience working with the Alliance as partners , notably in bringing peace and stability to the Balkans and Southeast Europe . 
Moreover , each will have benefited from several years of NATO-assisted defense reform . 
They will thus be net security contributors rather than mere consumers , making our Alliance even stronger . 
Deepening Partnerships : The attacks of &quot; 9 / 11 &quot; were masterminded by a Saudi who lived in Central Asia , planned by people from the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean living in Western Europe , and carried out in North America . 
These facts illustrate better than anything the need for security partnerships that extend to Central Asia and across the Mediterranean . 
These partnership mechanisms already exist . 
At Prague , we will make them even more effective . 
We will focus much more on combating terrorism together . 
We will intensify our cooperation on security sector reform . 
By enabling meetings in more flexible formats , we will make our partnership mechanisms even more responsive to the interests and concerns of each individual partner country . 
Enhancing NATO-Russia Relations : Once upon a time , most people in the West looked at Russia as part of the security problem . 
No longer . 
Today , in a strategic environment marked by terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , Russia is very much part of the solution . 
If the Prague summit will not showcase any grand new initiative , it is simply because we already launched a new NATO-Russia relationship last May at our special summit in Rome . 
The new NATO-Russia Council created in Rome offers us an effective and flexible mechanism for joint analysis , joint decisions , and even joint action . 
Much has already been achieved over the past six months to transform the political message of Rome into practical cooperation . 
It was Henry Kissinger who argued after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of 2001 that tragedy could be turned into opportunity . 
NATO has been heeding this insight . 
With stronger capabilities , new members , and deepened partnerships , the Alliance will demonstrate that it remains the premier instrument to address current and future security challenges . 
At Prague , this message will ring out loud and clear .
