A Confederation for Kosovo 
Time is running out in Kosovo . 
If a United Nations-backed settlement is not reached by early December , the province &apos;s majority Albanian population is likely to declare independence unilaterally - a move that the United States has announced it may support . 
That would be a disastrous step . 
Russia would be furious , because it fears that Kosovo &apos;s secession - whether or not it is internationally recognized - might fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire . 
Serbia is even more strongly opposed . 
Dusan Prorokovic , Serbia &apos;s state secretary for Kosovo , has said that his country might use force to maintain its sovereignty . 
Even if the government hesitates , ultranationalist groups might push Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to send in troops : the current UN presence in Kosovo is very thin ( only 40 &quot; military observers &quot; and 2,116 policemen ) but the stationing of 15,000 NATO troops could make any armed clash very dangerous . 
After eight years of international administration , Kosovo &apos;s Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is eager for full independence . 
But Serbia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition . 
Moreover , independence would not be accepted by the Serbian public , which has already watched in dismay as &quot; Great Serbia &quot; has been gradually whittled away , most recently with the secession of Montenegro . 
Serbia is prepared to concede only &quot; enhanced autonomy &quot; to Kosovo , and some capacity to enter into international agreements . 
Yet , while the two parties now seem irreconcilable , it is not too late for compromise . 
But this is possible only by resuscitating - and updating - an old institution of the international community : a confederation of states . 
By means of a binding UN Security Council resolution , Kosovo could be granted full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory , as well as limited capacity for action on the international scene . 
It could be authorized to enter into trade agreements as well as agreements concerning individuals ( for example , admission and circulation of foreigners , or extradition ) , plus the right to seek admission to the UN ( which does not require full sovereignty and independence ) . 
Kosovo would thus gain some essential trappings of statehood . 
However , a decision-making body consisting of delegates from Kosovo , Serbia , and the European Union would be given full authority over major foreign policy issues ( for example , alliances and relations with international economic institutions ) , defence , borders ( in case Kosovo wished to join with Albania ) , and the treatment of Kosovo &apos;s Serbian minority . 
As a result , Kosovo and Serbia would constitute two distinct international subjects , bound by a confederation hinging on a common decision-making body . 
Of course , this confederation would be asymmetrical , because the Serbian government &apos;s sovereignty over the rest of Serbia would remain intact and unlimited , whereas the Kosovar government &apos;s &quot; sovereignty &quot; over Kosovo would be restrained . 
To avoid one of the two parties getting the upper hand and imposing arbitrary decisions , the common decision-making body should consist of four Serbian delegates , two Kosovar delegates , and three representatives of the EU , thus requiring both sides to gain the support of the European delegates . 
In addition , the EU should create a small but effective military force ( say , 5,000 troops ) to back up the common body &apos;s decisions . 
As with any compromise , the contending parties would both gain and lose from this arrangement . 
Serbia would save face , and would continue to have a say on crucial matters concerning Kosovo , including the treatment of the Serbian minority . 
Kosovo would acquire limited independence , with its status rising from a province of a sovereign state to an international subject capable of entering into certain agreements with other states and even joining the UN . 
The EU would benefit as well , by contributing to the stabilization of a highly volatile area . 
Subsequently , the EU would monitor Kosovo and prevent any dispute that might turn violent . 
A final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary . 
Historically , confederations sooner or later either become federations ( as occurred in the US , Germany , and Switzerland ) or , pushed by centrifugal forces , split up ( as with the United Arab Republic , established in 1958 , which split three years later into Egypt and Syria ) . 
The confederation I advocate would thus constitute an intermediate stage ( lasting five or ten years ) , at the end of which Kosovo is likely to become fully independent . 
Delaying a final solution in this way would provide time to verify Kosovo &apos;s prospects of joining the EU and thus eventually sharing &quot; sovereign authority &quot; with other independent states , which could deflate Kosovars &quot; dangerously robust nationalistic demands .
