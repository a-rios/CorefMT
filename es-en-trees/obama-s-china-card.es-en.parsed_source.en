Obama &apos;s China Card ? 
MELBOURNE - According to the United States Federal Reserve , Americans &quot; net worth has fallen 40 % since 2007 , returning to its 1992 level . 
Progress towards recovery will be slow and difficult , and the US economy will be weak throughout the run-up to November &apos;s presidential and congressional elections . 
Can any incumbent - and especially President Barack Obama - win re-election in such conditions ? 
To be sure , the blame for America &apos;s malaise lies squarely with Obama &apos;s predecessors : Bill Clinton , for encouraging the Fed to take its eye off financial-market supervision and regulation , and George W. Bush , for his costly wars , which added massively to US government debt . 
But , come Election Day , many ( if not most ) Americans are likely to ignore recent history and vote against the incumbent . 
Given this , it would not be surprising if Obama and others in his administration were seeking non-economic issues to energize his campaign . 
National-security problems in general , and the challenge posed by China in particular , may be shaping up as just such issues . 
Obama &apos;s foreign and defense policies have been assertive , to say the least , especially in the Middle East and the Pacific . 
He has sanctioned far more unmanned drone strikes than Bush did ; extended the security services &quot; intrusion into Americans &quot; privacy ; allowed the CIA to continue its rendition program ; approved trials of accused terrorists by flawed military tribunals ; and has not shut Guant√°namo Bay . 
Moreover , the US is increasing its troop presence in the Pacific at a time when it already has more military force in the region than all other countries combined . 
Six aircraft carriers , with their accompanying support vessels - indeed , 60 % of America &apos;s entire navy - are now stationed in the Pacific . 
In addition , Obama &apos;s administration has been conducting talks with the Philippines to increase and enhance naval cooperation . 
Australia has established a base for marines in Darwin and another for unmanned spy planes on the Cocos Islands . 
That is not all . 
In a move that has received little or no publicity , congressional Republicans added a clause to the Defense Appropriation Bill for next year requiring the Obama administration to consult with countries in the Western Pacific about stationing even more forces - including tactical nuclear weapons - in the region . 
Senator Richard Lugar has advised me that since there has been little or no objection to the amendment from the White House , he sees no reason why it will not pass the Senate . 
At a recent security conference in Singapore , US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta emphasized the American military build-up in the region . 
Afterwards , he went to Vietnam , allegedly for discussions about the US Navy &apos;s use of Cam Ranh Bay , a major American base during the Vietnam War . 
The US , like Australia , denies that all of this adds up to a policy of containment aimed at China . 
But few in the Western Pacific see it that way . 
Panetta &apos;s visit to Vietnam followed hard on US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &apos;s visit to Beijing for strategic and economic talks . 
Those talks seemed to go well , but it is becoming increasingly clear that the US is pursuing a two-track policy : talks , yes , but a build-up and repositioning of US military power in the Pacific just in case . 
All of this is happening at a time when China is preparing for a change of leadership . 
I happen to believe that the political transition will occur smoothly . 
Others suggest that it will be - and already is - a difficult period of turmoil and uncertainty . 
The Obama administration may believe that toughness directed at China will generate electoral support in the US . 
During major international incidents or crises , America has seldom voted against an incumbent president . 
But has he properly reckoned with how provocative his policies are to China ? 
None of this is meant to suggest that the Pacific region does not need America . 
But , while America obviously has a significant role to play in the region , the US should have learned by now that its political objectives are unlikely to be achieved by military means . 
The Chinese themselves do not want the Americans to leave the Western Pacific , as that would make smaller countries on China &apos;s periphery even more nervous about Chinese power . 
China is mature enough to understand this ; nonetheless , a major US military build-up throughout the region is another matter . 
These are dangerous days , not only economically , but also strategically . 
We really do need to ask whether Obama is trying to play a China card to shift the electoral scales in his favor . 
If that is his intention , it is a move fraught with great danger . 
Australia should be saying to the US that it will have none of this . 
I would sooner abrogate the ANZUS Treaty with New Zealand and the US - that is , I would sooner end defense cooperation with the US - than allow nuclear missiles to be sited on Australian territory . 
The current Australian government would not take such a step , and the opposition would be unlikely to do so as well . 
But more and more Australians are beginning to question the closeness and wisdom of our strategic ties to the US . 
The Chinese understand the game being played .
