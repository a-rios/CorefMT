Parties and Populists 
This is not a good time for political parties , especially those with traditional orientations . 
Gone are the times in the older democracies when one could count on two major parties - one social democratic , the other more to the right of center - dominating the political scene . 
In the new democracies of the postcommunist world , such two-party systems never came into being . 
Nowadays the two largest parties can rarely hope to muster two-thirds of the popular vote . 
The rest of the vote is split many ways - unless a political force emerges to cut right through the old party structures by arousing popular nationalist or socialist sentiments , or a combination of the two . 
The decline of parties reflects the decline of class . 
The old proletariat and the old bourgeoisie are gone . 
Instead we see what has sometimes been called a &quot; levelled-in middle-class society , &quot; albeit one with an important elite of the super-rich at one end and an underclass at the other . 
The very structure of society has come to be shaky . 
There are no social groups on which lasting organizations can be built . 
People are , in a sense , socially homeless . 
This means that their interests vary as situations change . 
It also means that they no longer find a political home in parties , but react to situations , to vague moods , and above all to appeals to sentiments , if not resentments . 
This is the condition in which populists thrive . 
In some cases , they are individuals like President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela ( and other Latin American leaders ) or Italy &apos;s ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . 
Mostly they enter the political scene from the fringes but manage to form a highly personalized grouping , like Jörg Haider and his Austrian Freedom Party , Jean-Marie LePen and his French Nationalists , Andrzej Lepper and his Polish Peasant Party , or Prime Minister Robert Fico and his Direction in Slovakia . 
Many other names could be added to the list . 
The list tells us two things . 
One is that a surprising number of populist leaders have managed to get themselves into power in recent years . 
Their success reflects the electorate &apos;s uncertainties and , increasingly , the perceived injustices of globalization , as well as the fear of many about minorities , immigrants , and foreigners in general . 
These populists promise solutions that dispense with the habits and norms of moderation , notably with centrist democratic policies and an internationalism that seeks to promote peace and prosperity . 
One sometimes wonders whether we are experiencing not so much the end of history as the end of enlightened history , perhaps of the enlightenment itself . 
But another look at the list of populists tells us something else as well : most of them do not last . 
As long as they accept elections and election results , they may be gone almost as quickly as they arrived . 
It does not take long for voters to discover that the promises of populists were empty . 
Once in power , they simply make for bad government . 
Taking two recent European examples , Poles and Slovaks will likely soon realize that their new populist governments do more harm than good to the people and their country . 
To be sure , this is not much of a consolation . 
For one thing , some populist leaders may not accept the result of the next elections . 
It took Silvio Berlusconi quite a while to admit that he had lost . 
Beyond that , populist episodes are signs of an underlying instability that neither serves national progress nor contributes to international order . 
Austria paid a price for its Haider interlude , and France did not exactly benefit from the runoff between President Jacques Chirac and Le Pen in the last Presidential election . 
Is there a remedy ? 
Political parties have had a bad press in recent years , and there are good reasons for this . 
Still , they do fulfill a useful function by bundling interests and issues , thereby providing an element of stability in the political system . 
Existing parties urgently need to recapture the support of citizens . 
To succeed requires programmatic clarity , organizational honesty , and an understanding of the concerns of societies that have lost their traditional structures . 
Those structures are gone forever , but a liberal-democratic order cannot succeed through situational politics built on popular resentments . 
It requires a sense of the medium term and a commitment to rational debate of issues , for one tradition that can be revived - that of enlightened thinking - is the most important of all .
