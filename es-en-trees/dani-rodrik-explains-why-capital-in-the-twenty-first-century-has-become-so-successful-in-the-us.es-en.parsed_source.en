Piketty and the Zeitgeist 
PRINCETON - I get the same question these days wherever I go and from whomever I meet : What do you think of Thomas Piketty ? 
It &apos;s really two questions in one : What do you think of Piketty the book , and what do you think of Piketty the phenomenon ? 
The first question is much easier to answer . 
By sheer luck , I was among the earliest readers of the English-language version of Capital in the Twenty-First Century . 
Piketty &apos;s publisher , Harvard University Press , had sent me the pre-publication galleys , hoping that I would contribute a blurb for the back cover . 
I did so happily , as I found the scope , depth , and ambition of the book impressive . 
I was of course familiar with Piketty &apos;s empirical work on income distribution , carried out jointly with Emmanuel Saez , Anthony Atkinson , and others . 
This research had already produced startling new findings on the rise of the incomes of the super-rich . 
It was a tour de force on its own . 
But the book goes far beyond the empirical work , and narrates an intriguing cautionary tale about the dynamics of wealth under capitalism . 
Piketty warns us not to be fooled by the apparent stability and prosperity that was the common experience of the advanced economies during a few decades in the second half of the twentieth century . 
Perhaps more than the argument itself , what makes Capital in the Twenty-First Century a great read is the sense of witnessing a superb mind grapple with the big questions of our time . 
Piketty &apos;s emphasis on the political nature of the distribution of income ; his subtle back-and-forth between the general laws of capitalism and the role played by contingency ; and his willingness to offer bold ( if , to many , impractical ) remedies to save capitalism from itself are as refreshing as they are rare for an economist . 
So I would have liked to claim that I was prescient in foreseeing the huge academic and popular success that the book would have upon publication . 
In truth , the book &apos;s reception has been a big surprise . 
For one thing , the book is hardly an easy read . 
It is almost 700 pages long ( including the notes ) , and , though Piketty does not spend much time on formal theory , he is not beyond sprinkling an occasional equation or Greek letters throughout the text . 
Reviewers have made much of Piketty &apos;s references to Honor√© de Balzac and Jane Austen ; yet the fact is that the reader will encounter mainly an economist &apos;s dry prose and statistics , while the literary allusions are few and far between . 
The economics profession &apos;s response has not been uniformly positive . 
The book &apos;s argument revolves around a number of accounting identities that relate saving , growth , and the return to capital to the distribution of wealth in a society . 
Piketty is very good at bringing these abstract relations to life by hanging real numbers on them and tracing their evolution over history . 
Piketty &apos;s pessimistic prognosis rests on a slight extension of this accounting framework . 
Under plausible assumptions - namely that the wealthy save enough - the ratio of inherited wealth to income ( or wages ) continues to increase as long as r , the average rate of return to capital , exceeds g , the growth rate of the economy as a whole . 
Piketty argues that this has been the historical norm , except during the tumultuous first half of the twentieth century . 
If that is what the future looks like , we are facing a dystopia in which inequality will rise to levels never before experienced . 
Yet extrapolation is dangerous in economics , and the evidence that Piketty adduces to support his argument is hardly conclusive . 
As many have argued , the return to capital , r , may well start to decline if the economy becomes too rich in capital relative to labor and other resources and the rate of innovation slows down . 
Alternatively , as others have pointed out , the global economy may pick up speed , buoyed by developments in the emerging and developing world . 
Piketty &apos;s vision needs to be taken seriously , but it is hardly an iron law . 
Perhaps the source of the book &apos;s success should be sought in the zeitgeist . 
It is difficult to believe that it would have had the same impact ten or even five years ago , in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis , even though identical arguments and evidence could have been marshaled then . 
Unease about growing inequality has been building up for quite some time in the United States . 
Middle-class incomes have continued to stagnate or decline , despite the economy &apos;s recovery . 
It appears that it is now acceptable to talk about inequality in America as the central issue facing the country . 
This might explain why Piketty &apos;s book has received greater attention in the US than in his native France . 
Capital in the Twenty-First Century has reignited economists &quot; interest in the dynamics of wealth and its distribution - a topic that preoccupied classical economists such as Adam Smith , David Ricardo , and Karl Marx . 
It has brought to public debate crucial empirical detail and a simple but useful analytical framework . 
Whatever the reasons for its success , it has already made an undeniable contribution both to the economics profession and to public discourse .
