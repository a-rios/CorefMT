Burma &apos;s Democratic Charade 
PRAGUE - On November 7 , when Burma &apos;s first general election for almost two decades is to be held , a well-rehearsed script will play out . 
The country &apos;s ruling generals will twist what is meant to be a democratic process , whereby the people get to express their will , into a mockery of free expression in which people vote in fear and without hope . 
The international community must judge Burma &apos;s generals by their actions , not their words and promises . 
The facts on the ground in Burma speak the truth more loudly than all the proclamations from the generals about a free ballot and a democratic transition . 
More than 2,100 political prisoners remain in jail in Burma . 
Many have been tortured , kept in horrific conditions , and denied medical care . 
Attacks against the country &apos;s ethnic minorities continue , with the deliberate targeting of civilians , including children , by the Burmese military and police . 
The country &apos;s media remains censored , freedom of expression denied , and the most popular political party in the country , the National League for Democracy , which won elections in 1990 , has been forced to disband because it decided not to register for the November elections . 
In such conditions , free and fair elections will be impossible . 
This so-called democratic transition , a process designed solely by dictators and with input only from the regime &apos;s loyalists , will result in continued dictatorship . 
Before Burma &apos;s fate is sealed in a new-model dictatorship , the United Nations must immediately and vigorously embark on a fresh process designed to deliver national reconciliation and democracy to that troubled country . 
The international community , East and West , must unite behind a UN-led initiative to start genuine dialogue . 
But , for this dialogue to have any real legitimacy , it must include the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi , who has endured decades of house arrest , and her party , the NLD . 
Other democratic opposition groups , and genuine ethnic-minority representatives , also need to be given a voice in the process . 
Pressure must be brought to bear to bring Burma &apos;s generals to a negotiating table where real negotiations take place . 
But responsibility for assisting Burma does not lie solely at the door of the UN . 
The pressure on Burma &apos;s generals must also be bilateral and multilateral - and should be reinforced by carefully calibrated economic measures , including targeted financial and banking sanctions . 
Action must also be taken to end the impunity with which the Burmese generals have ruled . 
The dictatorship stands accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity , mostly against the country &apos;s minorities , who chafe at decades of oppression , ostracism , and military misrule . 
The UN General Assembly should follow the UN Special Rapporteur &apos;s recommendation to establish a Commission of Inquiry into war crimes and crimes against humanity in Burma . 
Moreover , the UN Security Council should impose an arms embargo against Burma , as it has in other countries similarly afflicted by conflict and serious human rights abuses . 
Those countries supplying arms to Burma expose themselves to charges of complicity in the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the dictatorship . 
Dictatorship and human rights abuses will continue in Burma after November 7 . 
We do not need to wait until after the election to know this . 
So there is no excuse for continued inaction . 
Now is the time for the world to unite behind the people of Burma , and to help bring them peace and dignity at last .
