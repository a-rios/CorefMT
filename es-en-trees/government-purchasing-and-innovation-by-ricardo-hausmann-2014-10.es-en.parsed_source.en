The Procurement Goldmine 
WASHINGTON , DC - Gold is rare . 
More than 99.9 % of the Earth &apos;s crust is composed of oxides of silicon , aluminum , calcium , magnesium , sodium , iron , potassium , titanium , and phosphorus . 
Despite the serious environmental consequences of gold mining , including mercury and cyanide pollution and the devastation of landscapes , humanity has not given up the search - and seems unlikely to do so any time soon . 
But there is a figurative goldmine - safer and potentially at least as lucrative as the real thing - that most countries possess , but few choose to exploit fully : government procurement . 
The potential adverse consequences of government procurement are well known . 
It can enable companies to charge excessive prices for low-quality goods and unreliable services , while facilitating corruption , abuses of power , and waste . 
To mitigate these risks , most countries have implemented requirements for open bidding processes and strict transparency rules for government purchases . 
Indeed , most recent free-trade agreements require signatories to open up government procurement to one another &apos;s firms , and the World Bank publishes the names of firms barred for fraud or corruption from bidding on Bank-financed projects . 
Countries that forego open bidding processes end up with the kind of large-scale theft that has been documented in Venezuela and almost certainly occurred in Ukraine under deposed President Viktor Yanukovych . 
But beneath all of this arsenic is gold . 
Most modern production involves not just the cost of doing things , but also the cost of figuring out how to do them . 
Before aircraft manufacturers can produce and sell a new airplane model , they must spend billions of dollars over a decade or more of development - costs that must later be recouped . 
If they were not sure whether there would be a market for the new model , few would assume these costs . 
That is where government procurement comes in . 
For example , in 1946 , the United States government issued a contract for Boeing to develop the B-52 . 
The government obviously did not want the company to deliver more of the same ; it wanted the first fast jet-powered strategic bomber . 
After all , the second-best army in a war is the loser . 
The contract thus had to reflect the risks inherent in finding out how to design and produce the most advanced aircraft of its time . 
But the benefits of the government purchase extended beyond its specific goal , when Boeing used the knowhow it acquired developing the B-52 to create its commercial B-707 aircraft . 
Though the government never purposely promoted the development of commercial airplanes , its procurement of high-quality , technologically advanced military aircraft was essential to the emergence of America &apos;s globally dominant commercial aircraft industry . 
Simply put , figuring out how to do one thing often makes it easier to do other things . 
In this way , a government that is exacting about the quality of its purchases can have a powerful impact on the evolution of its country &apos;s comparative advantage . 
Israel &apos;s government has had a similar impact through its effort to manage its limited water resources . 
Let &apos;s say that the country incurs a cost of 100 of some unit because of its water shortages . 
The innovations that the government encourages , such as drip irrigation or desalination , not only reduce the domestic cost of such shortages to , say , 70 , but also underpin an industry that , by selling its wares in the most demanding markets , accrues a global value of more than 1,000 . 
In this sense , Israel &apos;s water scarcity has made the country wealthier than it otherwise would have been . 
Likewise , Israel &apos;s military investments have generated a set of solutions that , with some extra effort , have had useful - and lucrative - civilian applications . 
This helps to explain why private investment in research and development constitutes a larger share of GDP in Israel than anywhere else in the world . 
The lessons from army purchases can be applied elsewhere . 
Governments are in the business of procuring solutions to their particular society &apos;s most pressing challenges . 
Given that a country &apos;s problems are rarely unique , innovative solutions can spawn globally competitive - even dominant - industries . 
And solutions for one problem may have applications in other areas . 
This should serve as a model for Latin America as it works to improve the quality of its educational systems . 
As it stands , the eight Latin American countries that take the OECD &apos;s standardized PISA exam are among the 15 worst-performing countries of the 65 that participate in the program . 
Instead of sinking massive amounts of money into poorly performing school systems , Latin American governments would undoubtedly be interested in innovative solutions , such as tablet-based textbooks , that can help teachers provide effective lessons , monitor their students &quot; progress , and identify remediation strategies . 
Beyond improving their own children &apos;s performance , such efforts could spawn a globally competitive industry in state-of-the-art teaching tools . 
These are just a few examples of the value that can be extracted from the government-procurement goldmine . 
By committing to purchase large amounts of high-quality products that address major national challenges , governments can encourage private , public , or mixed organizations to incur the fixed costs of finding solutions . 
In many cases , the benefits of those solutions will extend far beyond their original purpose . 
But , in pursuing such a path , governments must remember that mining is a potentially dangerous industry that must be approached with care . 
To this end , they could begin by applying , say , 5 % of their procurement budgets to nurture urgently needed solutions in areas with potentially large global markets . 
After all , anything that is worth doing is worth doing better .
