The Unended Recessional 
Zimbabwe &apos;s crisis has incited an unsettling feeling of déja vu . 
The reason is clear : it is , thankfully , no longer fashionable to decry colonialism &apos;s evils in assigning blame for every national misfortune . 
The imperial statues are toppled , cities and streets renamed , the vestiges of foreign rule either abandoned or adapted . 
With the sole exception of Zimbabwe , no leading politician in any post-imperial country has made a notable speech in recent years attacking colonialism . 
That great staple of political rhetoric appears to have been buried across the developing world . 
Internationally , colonialism is even more passé . 
Once , the votaries of one kind of new international order or another decried the evils of imperialism ( sometimes , but not always , prefixed with a &quot; neo- &quot; ) in justifying demands for a more just dispensation . 
That theme has died out in diplomatic discourse . 
Yet followers of world affairs would be unwise to consign colonialism to the proverbial dustbin of history , for it remains a factor in understanding our world &apos;s problems and dangers . 
To begin , residual problems from the end of the earlier era of colonization , usually the result of untidy exits by the colonial power , still remain dangerously stalemated . 
The events in East Timor in 1999 remain fresh in memory , and difficulties linger . 
But at least closure seems in sight , unlike those messy legacies of European colonialism : Western Sahara , Cyprus , and Palestine . 
Moreover , fuses lit in the colonial era could re-ignite , as they have done , to everyone &apos;s surprise , between Ethiopia and Eritrea , where war broke out over a colonial border that Italy &apos;s occupiers had failed to define with precision . 
In Zimbabwe , colonial land ownership patterns that gave most of the viable farmland to white settlers are at least one root of the country &apos;s current crisis . 
But not only the direct results of colonialism remain relevant : the indirect ones also matter . 
The intellectual history of colonialism is littered with many a willful cause of recent conflict . 
One is careless anthropology : Belgium &apos;s classification of Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi , which reified a distinction that had not existed before , still haunts Africa &apos;s Great Lakes region . 
A related problem arises from sociology : how much bloodshed do we owe , for instance , to the British invention of &quot; martial races &quot; in India ? 
One can never overlook the old colonial administrative habit of &quot; divide and rule , &quot; exemplified , again , by British policy in the subcontinent after 1857 , which led almost inexorably to the tragedy of Partition . 
Such distinctions were not merely pernicious ; they were often characterized by an unequal distribution of the resources of the state within a colonial society . 
Belgian colonialists favored Tutsis , leading to Hutu rejection of them as alien interlopers ; 
A &quot; mixed &quot; colonial history within one modern state is also a potential source of danger . 
When a state has more than one colonial past , its future is vulnerable . 
Ethnicity or language hardly seem to be a factor in the secessions ( one recognized , the other not ) of Eritrea from Ethiopia and the &quot; Republic of Somaliland &quot; from Somalia . 
Rather , it was different colonial experiences ( Italian rule in Eritrea , British rule in Somaliland ) that set them off , at least in their own self-perceptions , from the rest of their ethnic compatriots . 
A similar case can be made about the former Yugoslavia , where lands that existed under Austro-Hungarian rule for 800 years were joined to lands that spent almost as long under Ottoman suzerainty . 
The war that erupted in 1991 in no small measure pitted those parts that had been ruled by the German-speaking empires against those that avoided such colonization . 
Boundaries drawn in colonial times , even if unchanged after independence , still create problems , especially in Africa . 
Where colonial constructions force disparate peoples together by the arbitrariness of a colonial map-maker &apos;s pen , nationhood becomes elusive . 
Older tribal and clan loyalties in Africa were mangled by the boundaries drawn , in distant cities like Berlin , for colonially-created states whose post-independence leaders needed to invent new traditions and national identities . 
The result was the manufacture of unconvincing political myths , as artificial as the countries they mythologize , which all-too-often cannot command genuine patriotic allegiance from their citizenry . 
State failure in the wake of colonialism is another source of conflict . 
The collapse of effective central governments - manifested in recent years in Sierra Leone , Liberia and Somalia - could unleash a torrent of alarming possibilities because &quot; weak states , &quot; particularly in Africa , seem vulnerable to collapsing in a welter of conflict . 
Underdevelopment in post-colonial societies itself causes conflict . 
The uneven development of infrastructure , as a result of priorities skewed to benefit colonialists , can lead to resources being distributed unevenly , which can lead to increasing social fissures . 
Underdevelopment in many countries of the South , which are faring poorly in their struggle to remain viable in a globalizing world , creates conditions of desperate poverty , ecological collapse and rootless , unemployed populations beyond the control of atrophying state systems . 
We will not create a better world in the 21 st century by forgetting what happened in the 19 th and much of the 20 th . 
This is not to say that our responses to the dangers emerging from the legacies of the past must be rooted in the past . 
There is a greater need than ever before for innovative , forward-looking approaches to global governance . 
As we embark upon the still-new millennium , though , it seems ironically clear that tomorrow &apos;s possible disorder might be due , in no small part , to yesterday &apos;s colonial order . 
I have no wish to give politicians in post-colonial countries whose leadership has been found wanting any reason to find excuses in the past for their own failures . 
But in looking to understand possible future sources of conflict , the best crystal ball may be a rear-view mirror .
