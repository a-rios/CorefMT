The Experts &quot; Advantage 
LONDON - Nearly everyone who sits on Google &apos;s board of directors has at least one computer science or engineering degree or doctorate . 
There are two university presidents and eminent scholars - Stanford University &apos;s John Hennessy and former Princeton University President Shirley Tilghman - and several members of the National Academy of Engineering and other illustrious organizations . 
For Google , it pays to have technical expertise at the top . 
But Google is an unusual corporate giant in promoting those with scientific prowess to the top of the management ladder . 
Beyond Silicon Valley , few senior corporate executives boast technical expertise in the products that their companies produce . 
American boardrooms are filled with MBAs , especially from Harvard , while firms in the rest of the developed world ( with the possible exception of Germany ) seem to prefer professional managers over technical or scientific talent . 
Nowadays , it seems as anomalous to have knowledge workers serve as professional leaders as it once did to have scientists in the boardroom . 
It was previously thought that leadership is less necessary in knowledge-intensive organizations , where experts were assumed to be superior because they were motivated by intellectual pleasure rather than such extrinsic motivations as profit growth and cost targets . 
This difference in attitude is evident in many areas of society , not least in hospitals in the United States and the United Kingdom , where knowledge-intensive medical practitioners operate separately from managers . 
Hospitals used to be run by doctors ; today , only 5 % of US hospitals &quot; CEOs are medical doctors , and even fewer doctors run UK hospitals . 
&quot; Medicine should be left to the doctors , &quot; according to a common refrain , &quot; and organizational leadership should be left to professional managers . &quot; 
But this is a mistake . 
Research shows that higher-performing US hospitals are likely to be led by doctors with outstanding research reputations , not by management professionals . 
The evidence also suggests that hospitals perform better , and have lower death rates , when more of their managers up to board level are clinically trained . 
We see similar findings in other fields . 
My research shows that the world &apos;s best universities , for example , are likely to be led by exceptional scholars whose performance continues to improve over time . 
Departmental-level analysis supports this . 
A university economics department , for example , tends to perform better the more widely its head &apos;s own research is cited . 
With experts in charge , it may not always look like there is an effective reporting structure in place . 
But , as the academic saying goes : just because you cannot herd cats , does not mean there is not a feline hierarchy . 
As with cats , academics operate a &quot; relative hierarchy &quot; in which the person in charge changes , depending on the setting . 
Even in the world of sports , where success is not an obvious preparation for management , we see interesting linkages between experience and organizational performance . 
The very best NBA basketball players often make top coaches , while former Formula 1 champion drivers are associated with great team performance . 
Of the 92 soccer clubs in the English football league , club managers played an average of 16 years in senior clubs . 
Alex Ferguson , arguably Britain &apos;s best manager , scored an average of one goal every two games in his professional career . 
But where the pattern does occur , especially in the business world , we should take note . 
The senior partner of any professional services firm is likely to have been a top performer during a long career with the firm . 
This might be because experts and professionals in knowledge-intensive organizations prefer a boss who has excelled in their field . 
The leader &apos;s credibility is vital : if she sets high standards , it seems only right that she should have matched or exceeded them herself . 
In short , she must lead by example . 
This sort of leadership arrangement creates a virtuous circle . 
A leader with prior experience knows how her subordinates feel , how to motivate them , and how to create the right working environment . 
She probably makes better hiring decisions , too - after all , the best scientist or physician is more likely than a professional manager to know which researchers or doctors have the greatest potential . 
The problem , however , is not simply that today &apos;s leaders lack technical knowledge ; it is that experts are often reluctant to lead . 
But that can change . 
By communicating the importance of management and leadership early in a specialist &apos;s career , and by offering tailored , digestible , and jargon-free training , we could bridge the gap . 
Many medical schools are already considering including management education as part of the curriculum . 
The trick is to get experts , who are trained to go ever deeper into their specialization , to step back and view the big picture . 
With the right preparation , there is no reason why a leader cannot specialize and manage . 
The results could be remarkable . 
Think of how governments run by scientists with management skills might respond to climate change .
