Europe \ u0027s Refugee Opportunity 
ROME - Europe &apos;s so-called refugee crisis should never have become an emergency . 
Accommodating one million asylum-seekers should not be a huge challenge for the European Union - an area with 500 million citizens that welcomes more than three million immigrants every year . 
Unfortunately , the lack of a coordinated response is transforming a manageable problem into an acute political crisis - one that , as German Chancellor Angela Merkel has rightly warned , could destroy the EU . 
Most EU member states are selfishly focusing on their own interests . 
This pits them against one another and has precipitated panic , putting refugees in even greater peril . 
A smart , comprehensive plan would calm the fears . 
Instead , Europe has preferred to search for scapegoats - and Greece is the latest to be targeted for blame . 
Greece has been accused of not doing enough to process and house refugees . 
And yet , even if the country were not crippled by economic crisis , it would be unreasonable to expect a single small country to bear the burden alone - especially in a year when more than 800,000 refugees are expected to pass through its territory . 
This is a European and global problem , not solely a Greek problem . 
There is plenty of blame to go around . 
In Greece , George Soros &apos;s Open Society Foundations , acting in partnership with European Economic Area and Norway Grants , anticipated the problems that the lack of a serious European asylum policy would create . 
In 2013 , the partnership established an organization , Solidarity Now , run by the cream of Greek civil society . 
Solidarity Now needs just € 62 million ( $ 67 million ) to care for 15,000 of the 50,000 refugees who need to be housed in Greece next year . 
And yet , though the EU has promised to spend € 500 million to help Greece manage the crisis , some member states have failed to pay their share . 
In addition to supporting Greece , the EU needs a comprehensive plan for managing the arrival of asylum-seekers in a safe , orderly way . 
That means operating beyond Europe &apos;s borders , as , from the donors &quot; perspective , it is much less disruptive and expensive to maintain asylum-seekers close to their present locations . 
For starters , the EU should commit to absorbing at least 500,000 asylum-seekers a year , while working to convince the rest of the world to accept an equal number . 
A public commitment of this magnitude should help calm the disorderly scramble for Europe . 
Asylum-seekers provided with a clear status and promises of safety could be induced to wait in Turkey and other frontline countries , rather than risk a dangerous Mediterranean crossing . 
Second , formal gateways should be established , first in Turkey , and then in Lebanon , Jordan , Tunisia , and Morocco . 
Gateway countries would establish , in close cooperation with the United Nations Refugee Agency and the EU , processing centers to register asylum-seekers and assess their applications . 
Accepted asylum-seekers would then be placed in a queue and required to remain in the gateway country until an EU country accepts them . 
A safe , deliberate process of vetting refugees would quell security concerns in the aftermath of the Paris attacks . 
Gateway countries would have to improve reception , asylum , and integration standards . 
In exchange , these countries should be helped financially and provided with other incentives - for example , easier access to the EU for their citizens . 
Indeed , the EU should establish or expand programs that allow entry to non-asylum-seekers . 
Third , political , financial , and technical support must be provided to frontline countries . 
Turkey , Lebanon , and Jordan , which have borne most of the burden of the crisis , host more than four million Syrian refugees . 
Turkey says it has spent $ 7.8 billion to care for more than two million refugees ; thus far , it has received only $ 415 million from others ( though the EU has promised another € 3 billion ) . 
Full support for refugees in frontline countries is estimated to cost at least € 20 billion per year . 
The EU should commit at least half of this , with the balance coming from the rest of the international community . 
Special economic zones that benefit from preferred trade status with the EU and the United States should be created , in order to generate investment , economic opportunities , and jobs for refugees and locals alike . 
Fourth , the EU needs a truly common asylum and border-guard system . 
The patchwork of 28 separate asylum systems is expensive and inefficient , and it produces wildly uneven results in terms of the reception , status determination , and integration of new arrivals . 
The EU should establish a single European Border Guard and a single Asylum and Migration Agency . 
Fifth , a global response to the crisis , coordinated by the UN , must accompany the EU &apos;s plan . 
This would distribute the responsibility for addressing the refugee crisis over a larger number of states , while helping establish global standards for dealing with the challenge of forced migration . 
Finally , to finance the plan , the EU could use its AAA borrowing capacity to issue long-term bonds . 
The burden of servicing the bonds would be assigned to member states in inverse proportion to the number of asylum-seekers they accept . 
Those countries that can successfully integrate refugees would reap an economic advantage ; already , the German economy is growing significantly faster as a result of its willingness to accept Syrian refugees . 
The ongoing exodus from Syria and other war-torn countries was long in the making , easy to foresee , and eminently manageable . 
Fear-mongering nativists are taking advantage of the lack of a coordinated response to peddle a vision that runs counter to the values upon which the EU was built . 
Their vision , if realized , would violate European law ; already , it threatens to divide and destroy the EU . 
For this reason , it is all the more urgent that the EU backs a comprehensive strategy to end the panic and stop the unnecessary human suffering .
