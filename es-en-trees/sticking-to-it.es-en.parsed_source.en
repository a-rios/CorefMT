Sticking to It 
MELBOURNE - Sometimes we know the best thing to do , but fail to do it . 
New Year &apos;s resolutions are often like that . 
We make resolutions because we know that it would be better for us to lose weight , or get fit , or spend more time with our children . 
The problem is that a resolution is generally easier to break than it is to keep . 
That is why , by the end of January , most people have already abandoned their New Year &apos;s resolutions . 
John Stuart Mill , in his classic defense of liberty , argued that each individual is the best judge and guardian of his or her own interests . 
But recent research suggests that we can use some help . 
Dean Karlan , a professor of economics at Yale University , examined ways to help some of the Philippines &quot; poorest people achieve their goals . 
He found that , like people everywhere , they had difficulties resisting the temptation to spend what little they had , even when they recognized that it would be better to save for a goal that could make a more substantial difference to their lives . 
When given access to banking , they would save a little , but then withdraw it before they reached their goal . 
But , if offered a savings account that penalized them for withdrawing money before they reached a goal that they themselves had specified , many chose that type of account , even though the interest they earned was no higher than in an account that allowed them to make withdrawals whenever they chose . 
Using the account that penalized early withdrawals helped them achieve their goals . 
Karlan then turned to other areas in which people lack self-control . 
He found that when people want to quit smoking , they are more likely to succeed if they arrange to lose money should they fail . 
In a randomized trial , 30 % of those who risked a penalty for failure achieved their goal , compared to only 5 % in the control group . 
Karlan discussed his work with colleagues at Yale . 
How , they asked themselves , can we give people stronger incentives to keep their resolutions and achieve their personal goals ? 
You can find their answer at a Web site they helped to start , www.stickK.com. , where you can make a Commitment Contract , which obliges you to reach a goal of your own choosing . 
Then , as an incentive to fulfill your commitment , you can decide on a penalty that you must pay if you fail . 
For example , one way of giving yourself a strong incentive to reach your goal is to commit to pay money to someone if you fail . 
Better yet , you can specify that you will have to pay a certain sum to a cause that you detest . 
If you support protection of the world &apos;s rain forests , you could decide that your penalty payment will go to an organization that favors commercial development of the Amazon . 
In addition , the Web site makes the commitment public , and allows you to have supporters who will encourage you to meet your goal , and whom you will disappoint if you fail . 
So far , 45,000 people have used stickK to make Commitment Contracts , with a success rate , for those who give themselves a financial incentive , above 70 % . 
Karlan &apos;s research , and the results obtained at stickK , suggests that most people , when they are thinking calmly , have a sense of what is in their interests , but , faced with more immediate temptations , are often unable to keep to their plans . 
For example , the wide availability of electronic gaming machines and online gambling makes it difficult for &quot; problem gamblers &quot; to stop gambling , even though they know that they are losing more than they can afford to lose . 
As a result , many ruin themselves financially , causing great distress to their families . 
Some stoop to crime to pay their gambling debts . 
Could a commitment contract help problem gamblers to stop ? 
For the past two years , almost all gambling in Norway has required the use of an electronic card . 
Cash is forbidden . 
The card allows the government to impose daily and monthly limits on the amount players can lose on electronic gaming machines . 
This approach appears paternalistic , and perhaps it is , but it could also be defended in terms of preventing people from making their children destitute , and becoming - in a country like Norway , which provides for its poor - a burden on the state . 
But the card also gives gamblers the chance to set limits for themselves . 
They can limit how much money they will spend , or how long they will spend at a machine at any one time . 
That is not paternalism , just an encouragement to pause and reflect . 
The idea of offering gamblers a chance to set their own limits before they begin a gambling session is beginning to spread around the world . 
In addition to Norway , it exists , in various forms , in Sweden , New Zealand , and the Canadian province of Nova Scotia . 
Australia &apos;s Productivity Commission recently studied the value of such pre-commitment systems . 
It estimated the annual social cost of problem gambling in Australia at $ 4.7 billion , and recommended that voluntary pre-commitment systems be phased in for electronic gaming machines . 
The government , under pressure from an independent member of parliament on whose support it relies , has now promised to implement the Commission &apos;s main recommendations . 
Human decision-making is complex . 
On our own , our tendency to yield to short-term temptations , and even to addictions , may be too strong for our rational , long-term planning . 
But when the temptations are not immediately present , we can erect barriers to them that make us less likely to succumb when they return . 
Knowing that we can control our own behavior makes it more likely that we will .
