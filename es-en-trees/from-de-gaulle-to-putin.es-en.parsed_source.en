From de Gaulle to Putin 
PARIS - Fifty years ago , General Charles de Gaulle seized power in France in what was , in essence , a legal coup d &apos;etat . 
True , the General had been called upon and elected by the floundering French Parliament . 
But pressure from the French army , and rebellion in Algeria , did not give Parliament much of a choice . 
The ailing French republic &apos;s political leaders hoped that de Gaulle could end the Algerian war , yet keep Algeria French . 
De Gaulle &apos;s agenda was very different : he wanted to rewrite the Constitution and to found a new &quot; Fifth Republic &quot; for France . 
The war in Algeria was , for de Gaulle , but another symptom of a dysfunctional state , an analysis that went back to his own experiences in 1940 , when the French government proved unable to resist invasion by Hitler &apos;s Germany . 
Only a strong leader , de Gaulle thought , could have avoided defeat . 
In his memoirs , de Gaulle stated his preference for restoring the monarchy after the Liberation . 
But public opinion was not prepared for that , and the heirs to the French crown were not up to the task . 
The alternative was an elected monarch : the Fifth Republic &apos;s Constitution , ratified 50 years ago this week , was crafted around that central principle . 
What de Gaulle despised about the Fourth Republic was what he dubbed the &quot; regime of the parties , &quot; which put their own interests above the national interest . 
Only a king or an elected monarch could incarnate the national interest . 
Remarkable propagandist that he was , de Gaulle convinced the French that the Fourth Republic was a disaster - a canard that has remained common wisdom ever since . 
But de Gaulle &apos;s vision of government resonated with the convictions of many French and , above all , with many public intellectuals . 
The French have seldom been enamored of democracy . 
The philosophers who were the intellectual fathers of the 1789 revolution longed not for democracy , but for enlightened despotism , which is what many French still look for when they elect a president . 
Democracy from a French perspective looks too American . 
The French are thus more ready to believe in the cultural diversity of nations than in the universality of democracy . 
This explains why French governments of both right and left tend to support despotism in countries where it seems &quot; natural . &quot; 
Despots in Arab countries , China , and Russia do not shock the French . 
Indeed , no French president would ever think of exporting democracy . 
As former President Jacques Chirac said : to impose democracy in Arab countries means that you despise their cultural differences . 
As de Gaulle wished , the French president has powers without equal in any other Western democracy . 
Montesquieu &apos;s idea of a separation of governmental powers plays no role in France . 
Parliament is weak , the judiciary is under executive control , the media is kept under surveillance , and there is no constitutional guarantee of free speech . 
The president &apos;s powers are limited only by accident , when a majority in parliament happens to be against him : this happened to both the socialist François Mitterrand and the conservative Jacques Chirac . 
Each had to &quot; cohabit &quot; for a time with a hostile parliament . 
Military and foreign affairs - what the French system deems the president &apos;s &quot; reserve domain &quot; - are always in the president &apos;s personal control . 
But when president and parliament are controlled by the same party - Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s current situation - the &quot; reserved domain &quot; knows , in practice , no limit . 
Despite this huge concentration of powers in the presidency , or perhaps because of it , the Fifth Republic has failed to perform better than more democratic Western regimes . 
The French state budget is chronically ill-managed , running deficits on par with Italy . 
Many grandiose Gaullist economic projects - from the Concorde supersonic airplane to a national computer industry - failed . 
Most public-sector industries have been near bankruptcy until saved by competition and privatization . 
France &apos;s elected monarchs have few reasons to be proud of their supposedly efficient state . 
The exception may be the military and the diplomatic service : following de Gaulle &apos;s lead , all French presidents have financed the military generously . 
The Gaullist tradition has also been maintained by an independent diplomatic corps that tends towards &quot; non-alliance with allies &quot; and is often perceived as perfidious and arrogant . 
Indeed , through much of the Cold War , de Gaulle appeared to want to avoid having to choose sides between the United States and the Soviet Union . 
Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing had the best relations with East European communist leaders among all Western leaders . 
Chirac vociferously opposed the war in Iraq . 
Sarkozy nowadays acts more in harmony with the US , NATO , and the European Union , but does so because he wants to be a world leader . 
But the real problem with the Fifth Republic might be its influence beyond France . 
Following de Gaulle &apos;s lead , elective monarchy or enlightened despotism is now perceived as a legitimate alternative to parliamentary democracy or US-style separation of powers . 
Most of Latin America , except for Brazil and Chile , are elective monarchies , a modernized version of the old caudillo tradition . 
Russia , after a brief attempt at democracy under Boris Yeltsin , has reverted to a form of unenlightened despotism under Vladimir Putin . 
It holds elections , but more as a nod to modernity than to represent the people &apos;s will . 
Like the Mona Lisa in the Louvre , the French Revolution &apos;s clarion call for universal rights can be admired only from behind bullet-proof glass , and it is definitely too precious to be exported .
