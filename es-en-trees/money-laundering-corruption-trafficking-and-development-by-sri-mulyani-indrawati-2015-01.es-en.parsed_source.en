Dirty Money and Development 
WASHINGTON , DC - The world has made enormous progress in recent decades in the fight against poverty . 
But , as 2015 begins , one billion people - one in seven - still live on less than $ 1.25 a day . 
It will take a global effort to end poverty - and to find the resources to do so . 
At first glance , the price tag is staggering . 
We know that development aid will not be sufficient to end poverty . 
It will take private sector investment , taxes collected in developing countries , and other sources of finance to do the job . 
The truth is that there is enough money in the world to get it done . 
One unexpected source of wealth that could play a large role is the world &apos;s huge supply of dirty money : multinational companies &quot; undeclared profits , the proceeds of corruption , and the earnings of traffickers of drugs , weapons , and people - all of which is stashed away in offshore bank accounts , companies , and trusts . 
Reliable numbers about the amount of dirty money around the world are difficult to come by . 
But according to an estimate by the non-profit Global Financial Integrity group , $ 1 trillion vanishes from the developing world &apos;s economies every year . 
That is money that is badly needed for development . 
This is also roughly the amount needed to fill the vast infrastructure gap that is preventing the world from addressing critical developmental challenges - from rapid urbanization to climate change and job creation . 
Today , developing and emerging countries invest about $ 1 trillion a year in infrastructure . 
They need an additional $ 1 trillion a year to close the gap , a necessary step to ending extreme poverty by 2030 . 
But a lack of implementation and enforcement of anti-money-laundering , tax transparency , and anti-corruption rules is shielding the perpetrators from prosecution . 
This ultimately prevents developing countries from stopping the outflow of money that is bleeding them of essential resources . 
For the schoolchild in Port-au-Prince , the new mother in Mogadishu , or the farmer in Ocotepeque , these losses have a real impact : overcrowded classrooms , non-existent health clinics , and inadequate water resources . 
People &apos;s opportunities are being stolen from them . 
Fortunately , the international community has woken up . 
An initiative of African finance ministers , chaired by former South African president Thabo Mbeki , is investigating the issue on the continent , where up to $ 1.4 trillion was lost to illicit outflows over the last three decades . 
Most recently , the G-20 has begun to call for global action to ensure that bad deeds do not pay . 
And , at a recent meeting in Berlin , governments signed a deal to crack down on cross-border tax evasion . 
This is good news , particularly for the poor . 
But many hurdles remain , and now the world must focus on three critical issues . 
First , developing countries must build effective institutions while enforcing good governance , transparency , and accountability . 
They must fight corruption , combat organized crime , and implement effective tax systems , which is even more critical in resource-rich countries . 
Recent events in the Middle East and Ukraine demonstrate how the capture of state coffers by vested interests instigates conflict and undermines people &apos;s trust in government . 
But corruption , money laundering , and tax evasion are global problems , not just challenges for developing countries . 
Though weak national institutions and limited law-enforcement capacity may make it easier to initiate illicit financial transfers , we need to acknowledge that dirty money often ends up in financial centers , which have become quasi-enablers . 
That is why addressing the issue requires international cooperation . 
Second , regulations that identify the true owners of illicit funds need to be enforced . 
Once such assets are parked in opaque companies , they are often beyond the reach of tax authorities and investigators . 
Again and again , the true recipients or beneficial owners of companies and trusts are shielded from disclosure by laws and regulations that inadvertently protect criminals . 
This must stop . 
Finally , a system for the automatic exchange of tax information among countries would limit the places where tax evaders and money launderers can easily hide their proceeds . 
Almost 90 countries have now committed to begin , as early as 2017 , cross-border data exchanges that would include information about account holders and certain details regarding their deposits and balances - information that could help authorities identify proceeds from corruption and illegal transactions through suspicious activity and spikes . 
More action is needed this year and beyond . 
At the World Bank , we are already working with our clients in developing countries to improve their governance systems , collect taxes , fight corruption , and recover stolen assets . 
Our work will benefit enormously from the current push for more international cooperation in curbing illicit financial flows . 
Changing much-cherished bank-secrecy laws is worth the effort . 
Corruption , tax evasion , and the capture of natural-resource revenues undermine the rule of law , weaken the social fabric , erode citizens &quot; trust in institutions , fuel conflict and insecurity , and hamper job creation . 
They are not just illegal , but also immoral , because they keep poor people poor .
