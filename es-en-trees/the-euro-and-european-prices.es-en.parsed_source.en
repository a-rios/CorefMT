The Euro and European Prices 
Among the hoped-for effects of the Euro &apos;s physical arrival are an increased transparency of the differences in retail prices between different EMU countries , and a subsequent pressure to equalize these prices . 
The argument for the latter is simple : with national currencies eliminated and everything priced in Euros , how can similar cars or loaves of bread have different prices on either side of a border ? 
Pressures will be formidable to buy where prices are low and sell , or at least not to buy , where prices are high . 
That argument , however , is naive , for it does not take a genius to compare the price of a car in Germany with the price of the same car in France . 
Everybody makes such calculations when they decide where to take vacations abroad , so why believe that they do not do it for other goods and services ? 
People are not as stupid or lazy as politicians and bureaucrats think . 
The interesting question is this : how much are price discrepancies due to sheer ignorance and inertia , and how much are they due to factors that are unlikely to change with the Euro &apos;s arrival ? 
Start with the evidence on retail prices . 
UBS , the Swiss banking group , prices a standard basket of 111 goods and services in various cities around the world . 
For European cities , the results are listed in the table below , which uses Germany as the benchmark . 
Obviously , huge price differences exist- if people in Finland were to do their shopping in Spain , they would increase their purchasing power by 50 % ! 
So , if price equalization were to happen , citizens in rich countries would feast and those in poorer countries would pay through the nose . 
But that won &apos;t happen ; price level differences will not change much , the Euro notwithstanding . 
The UBS survey shows that prices in Frankfurt are 8 % higher than in Berlin . 
Prices in Houston , Texas ( to use prices in a similar unitary monetary area , the US ) are 26 % less than in NY , and somewhat less than in Los Angeles . 
Both differences matter because they show that price equalization does not occur simply because a common currency exists . 
What , then , is behind lasting differences in prices within and between countries ? 
There are three important factors : 
anti-competitive practices . 
Of course free trade exists in principle , but there are often important snags at borders and within countries . 
In America , for example , it is illegal to ship wine privately from California to Massachusetts because wine wholesalers in Massachusetts managed to have a Federal law established that protects their huge profit margins . 
What would be easy arbitrage using the Internet and delivery services gets stopped in its tracks by trade organizations and manufacturers who convince legislators and / or bureaucrats to protect their monopoly rents . 
In Europe , anti-competitive practices are rampant . 
If the EU is serious about creating one market , plenty of work remains to be done . 
differences in competition and scale . 
The smaller the market , the fewer the number of distributors that can serve it profitably . 
But the fewer the number of distributors , the less competition there is . 
So margins become fatter and prices higher . 
Often competition is limited by regulations that fragment markets , but sometimes it is a matter of it being unprofitable to arbitrage to , say , bring in your croissants from Belgium each morning . 
retail prices . 
The critical point here is that a retail price includes not only the price of the goods but also distribution costs - wages of shop personnel , rent , advertising , profit margins , etc . 
These differ vastly across countries , as the table suggests . 
There are no big productivity differences between Finland and Portugal when it comes to standing behind a counter selling stockings . 
Yet wages are vastly different and hence we expect lower retail prices in poorer cities and countries than in richer ones . 
New York versus Houston makes that point just as well as France versus Greece . 
What goes for wages also goes for other distribution costs . 
In principle , the entire Eurozone forms a single market , but that is not how things work out in practice . 
There is a famous saying in America that &quot; all politics are local . &quot; 
The same is true of prices . 
A survey of the cost of grooming a poodle in the Greater Boston Area conducted by Harvard &apos;s Kennedy School of Government revealed price differences in excess of 100 % . 
A surprise ? 
Of course not , pet grooming is expensive in rich parts of Boston and cheap in poor parts , just as haircuts are . 
What is the upshot here ? 
Price divergences are here to stay . 
The Euro will do little to change that . 
Over time , there will be a tendency for these divergences to be compressed , but that won &apos;t be a result of the Euro . 
It will arise from Brussels , the spread of web-based buying habits , and the emergence of EU-wide retail distribution . 
When all is said and done , however , European prices will look as they do in the US , where large divergences exist a century after free trade and a common currency were established between the states .
