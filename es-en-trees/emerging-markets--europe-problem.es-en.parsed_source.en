Emerging Markets &quot; Europe Problem 
PARIS - From Hong Kong to SÃ£o Paulo , and all points between , one word dominates all others among big investors : Greece . 
Will the Greeks remain in the eurozone ? 
What will happen to the European Union and the global economy if they do not ? 
Until recently , Europe was a sort of mirror that confirmed for the major emerging economies the spectacular nature of their own success . 
They could contrast their high growth rates with Europe &apos;s high levels of debt . 
They could oppose their &quot; positive energy &quot; with the pessimism dominating European minds . 
They were only too willing to advise Europe to work harder and spend less , as legitimate pride mingled with an understandable desire to settle historical scores and attenuate their legacies of colonial submission and humiliation . 
But , today , emerging countries are growing very concerned with what they rightly perceive as the serious risks to their own economies implied by excessive weakness in Europe , which remains the world &apos;s trade leader . 
Moreover , Europe &apos;s malaise threatens many of these countries &quot; political stability as well , given the close connection - especially in China - between the legitimacy of existing arrangements and the continuation of rapid economic growth . 
If the crisis in Europe were to cause annual GDP growth to fall below 7 % in China , 5 % in India , and 3 % in Brazil , these countries &quot; most vulnerable citizens would be hardest hit . 
They were never part of the &quot; culture of hope , &quot; based largely on material success , that played a key role in these countries &quot; success . 
If social inequalities were to reach new heights , their frustration and resentment could manifest itself fully . 
In that case , Europe could suddenly become a very different mirror for emerging countries , revealing , if not accentuating , their own structural weaknesses . 
And that is why , just as Europe must save the Greek economy or Spain &apos;s banks at all costs , emerging countries must do whatever they can to contribute to the rescue of the European economy . 
As Europe has learned , the longer one waits , the higher the cost - and the lower the chance of success . 
Unfortunately , a group of countries that are united above all by a common denial of their global responsibilities is unlikely to reach such a conclusion . 
Indeed , most emerging countries would balk at the idea of coming to Europe &apos;s financial rescue for several reasons . 
First , there is no such thing as a bloc of emerging countries . 
They are not united by a common vision of their future , or by a common political ideal , such as democracy in the Western world . 
Whatever the limits or contradictions of shared values , it would be naive to dismiss their importance . 
Europe and the United States will remain allies even if Barack Obama , like Nicolas Sarkozy in France , turns out to be a one-term president . 
Second , emerging countries are more Europe &apos;s rivals than its partners . 
They are united only by their shared suspicion of China . 
In such a context , a common long-term strategy is extremely difficult to conceive . 
The Chinese may proclaim that they tend to think over a &quot; longer &quot; term than Americans , who think more &quot; broadly , &quot; and Europeans , who think more &quot; deeply , &quot; as a well-known Chinese international relations expert has put it . 
But , when it comes to the European financial crisis , China &apos;s behavior seems to be determined by purely short-term tactical considerations , even as Chinese investments in Europe tripled in 2011 . 
To buy half of the Piraeus harbor at a knockdown price may seem more advantageous than investing in the long-term consolidation of the Greek economy and its finances , but is that really the case ? 
Third , emerging countries &quot; short-term opportunism is based on a double distrust : towards Europe , of course , but also , paradoxically , towards themselves . 
That is , they lack confidence in their ability to do their part to save the sick man of the global economy that Europe has become . 
To be sure , this runs counter to the triumphalism emanating from Asia , in particular . 
Kishore Mahbubani , a leading foreign-policy thinker from Singapore , recently proclaimed in Vienna , at a conference organized by my institute , that the next millennium would be Asian . 
And yet one senses among elites from emerging countries something akin to existential doubt , which the European crisis has served to reinforce . 
This insecurity manifests itself in many ways : from the accumulation of liquid wealth as insurance against foreign and domestic uncertainties to the choice of many , if not most , to educate their children abroad . 
In fact , the sick man - undeniably European , if not Western - could reveal himself to be more resilient , owing to the strength of his own natural defenses : democracy and the rule of law . 
That is why the current European crisis may well prove to be a crucial test for emerging countries that are more dynamic than Europe economically , but ultimately more fragile politically .
