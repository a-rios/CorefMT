India or China ? 
NEW DELHI - When US President Barack Obama visited India in November and complimented its leaders on the growing success and prowess of their economy , a tacit question returned to center stage : Will China grow faster than India indefinitely , or will India shortly overtake it ? 
In fact , this contest dates back to 1947 , when India gained independence and democracy became the country &apos;s defining feature , while China turned to Communism with the success of Mao Zedong after the Long March . 
Both countries , the &quot; sleeping giants , &quot; were expected to awaken at some point from their slumber . 
But , since the growth model in vogue at the time laid principal emphasis on capital accumulation , China was widely held to have the advantage , because it could raise its investment rate higher than India , where democracy limited the extent to which the population could be taxed to increase domestic savings . 
As it happened , however , both giants slept on - until the 1980 &quot; s in China and the early 1990 &quot; s in India - mainly because both countries embraced a counter-productive policy framework that crippled the productivity of their investment efforts . 
Reflecting flawed economic arguments , India embraced autarky in trade and rejected inflows of equity investment . 
It also witnessed economic interventionism on a massive scale , including the proliferation of public-sector enterprises in areas beyond public utilities . 
In China , the results were similar , as the political embrace of Communism meant going autarkic and giving the state a massive role in the economy . 
After progressively dismantling their inefficient policy frameworks in favor of &quot; liberal &quot; reforms , the two giants began to stride forth . 
The race was finally on . 
And , once again , China seemed to be the horse to bet on : it grew faster , because it changed its policy framework much faster than democracy permits . 
But there are good reasons to suspect that China &apos;s authoritarian advantage will not endure . 
First , while authoritarianism can accelerate reforms , it can also be a serious handicap . 
Years ago , when both Mao and Zhou Enlai were alive , Padma Desai , the Columbia University expert on Russia , was asked about China &apos;s future growth prospects . 
She answered : it depends on whether Mao dies first or Zhao dies first - her point being that in a top-heavy system , growth paths can become unpredictable , and thus subject to volatility . 
Moreover , we know from experience elsewhere - and now in China itself - that as growth accelerates , political aspirations are aroused . 
Will the Chinese authorities respond to them with ever greater repression , as they have with dissidents and Falun Gong , creating discord and disruption , or will they accommodate new popular demands by moving to greater democracy ? 
Again , China &apos;s authoritarian politics means that it cannot profit from the innovations that depend on software , as that is an instrument through which dissent can flourish and become subversive of total control . 
As one wit has observed , the PC ( personal computer ) and the CP ( Communist Party ) do not go together . 
Finally , China &apos;s growth must continue to depend on its exploitation of external markets , which makes it vulnerable in a world that is increasingly making democracy and human rights a central preoccupation . 
In such a world , continued hassles and hiccups for Chinese exports can be confidently expected . 
Economic factors also militate against Chinese prospects . 
China was clearly able for many years to exploit a &quot; reserve army of the unemployed &quot; Ã  la Karl Marx - to grow rapidly without facing a labor-supply constraint , so that capital accumulation would not run into diminishing returns . 
But now , given China &apos;s one-child policy and lack of adequate infrastructure ( including housing ) in rapidly growing areas , labor is getting scarce and wages are rising . 
In economic jargon , the supply curve of labor was flat but is now sloping upward , so that rapidly increasing demand for labor resulting from rapid growth is driving up wages . 
That means that China is beginning to &quot; rejoin the human race &quot; as capital accumulation meets scarcer labor and growth slows . 
By contrast , India has a far more abundant supply of labor , as well as a more favorable demographic profile , so that , as India &apos;s investment rate increases , labor will not be a constraint . 
India will thus become the new China of the past two decades . 
Besides , in contrast to China , where economic reforms were quicker and more complete , India still has a way to go : privatization , labor-market reforms , and opening up the retail sector to larger , more efficient operators are all pending - and will give a further boost to India &apos;s growth rate once they are implemented .
