What Now In the Middle East ? 
The political and security situation in the vast region between the Indus Valley and the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean is a cause for grave concern . 
When the US intervened militarily in Iraq in 1991 , the intention was to effect fundamental change in the entire region . 
Today it is clear that hardly any aspect of this policy has succeeded . 
Even the success of free elections in Iraq is threatening to divide rather than unite the country . 
The existing power relations in the Middle East have indeed been permanently shaken and , indeed , revolutionized . 
The effect however , has not been a domino-like democratization ; instead we are threatened with a domino effect of descent into chaos . 
The decision to go to war against Iraq to liberate Kuwait , back in 1991 , marked the beginning of America &apos;s role as the sole hegemonic military power in the region . 
The decision to go to war against Iraq for a second time , and then to occupy the country in March 2003 , transformed this hegemony into direct US responsibility for the future of the Middle East . 
Two outcomes could flow from America &apos;s adopted role as the decisive power in the Middle East . 
Were the US to succeed in using its military strength , it would create a new , democratic Middle East . 
But were it , despite its military might , to fail , it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region . 
The second scenario - which was foreseeable from the outset - has now become a reality . 
The very character of the war in Iraq has been transformed from a democratizing mission into a stabilizing mission high in casualties and in cost . 
Instead of the intended radical realignment of power relations in the region , the aim is now to simply maintain the status quo . 
The most the US can hope at this point is a withdrawal that saves face . 
The recent elections in America were a referendum on the war in Iraq . 
Their result in fact set a timetable for the &quot; Iraqisation &quot; and US withdrawal - before the next presidential election . 
Behind the all-too-foreseeable end of the American stabilizing mission lurks a civil war in Iraq , which threatens to turn into an Arab-Iranian proxy war for dominance in Iraq , the Gulf , Lebanon , the Palestinian territories , and beyond . 
Moreover , there is an acute risk that the power vacuum created in Iraq will fuse the Israeli-Arab conflict , Iraq , and Afghanistan into one regional mega-crisis . 
In light of America &apos;s impending withdrawal , the regional powers are reassessing their interests and objectives . 
Iran , Syria , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Jordan , Pakistan , Turkey , and Israel will be the main players . 
With the Iraq war , the US has lost its unilateral-power position in the Middle East , and elsewhere . 
In the future , various global powers will be active in the Middle East - primarily the US , Russia , China , India . 
Let &apos;s hope Europe is amongst them , because its security is defined there . 
So at stake is no longer just Iraq , but rather the future of the entire region . 
We can count ourselves lucky if the emerging chaos can be contained in Iraq . 
Washington &apos;s realization that Iraq can no longer be won or even stabilized unless the regional framework changes , has come late - perhaps too late . 
The US will have to find agreement with its allies and enter into direct talks with all the other players to try and achieve a new regional consensus . 
If this policy shift had taken place a year ago or even early last summer , the prospects would have been better . 
And with every passing day , America &apos;s position in the region is weakening further and the chances of a successful new political strategy become more remote . 
The greatest danger stems from Iran , the clear beneficiary of the Iraqi power vacuum . 
Iran harbors hegemonic ambitions which it seeks to realize by means of its military potential , oil and gas reserves , its nuclear program , its influence over Shiites throughout the region , and its efforts to upset the status quo within the Arab Muslim world . 
Yet Iran is also relatively isolated . 
Its only allies in the region are Syria and Hezbollah . 
What &apos;s more , it is threatened by a de-facto anti-Iranian coalition of all other regional powers , united by their fear of Iranian ascendancy . 
If the West - America and Europe - act swiftly , decisively , and with a joint strategy , there remains a chance to stabilize the situation . 
But to achieve this , it will be necessary to offset , or at least balance , the interests of the most important actors in the region . 
This means a strategy based on political leverage not a threat of military intervention or regime change . 
In their stead must come , on the one hand , direct talks , security guarantees , and support in political and economic integration . 
To be successful , this strategy also requires a realistic threat of isolation of those who continue to undermine regional stability , as well as substantial progress in the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
A new Middle East policy will thus have to concentrate primarily on four aspects : 1 ) a comprehensive offer to Syria to detach the country from Iran and settle open conflicts ; 2 ) an offer to Iran for direct talks about the perspective of a full normalization of relations ; 3 ) a decisive and realistic initiative to resolve the Israeli-Arab conflict 4 ) a regional security architecture that centers on stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan .
