Free Speech under Siege 
LONDON - Recently , at a literary festival in Britain , I found myself on a panel discussing free speech . 
For liberals , free speech is a key index of freedom . 
Democracies stand for free speech ; dictatorships suppress it . 
When we in the West look outward , this remains our view . 
We condemn governments that silence , imprison , and even kill writers and journalists . 
ReportersSans Fronti√®res keeps a list : 24 journalists have been killed , and 148 imprisoned , just this year . 
Part of the promise we see in the &quot; Arab Spring &quot; is the liberation of the media from the dictator &apos;s grasp . 
Yet freedom of speech in the West is under strain . 
Traditionally , British law imposed two main limitations on the &quot; right to free speech . &quot; 
The first prohibited the use of words or expressions likely to disrupt public order ; the second was the law against libel . 
There are good grounds for both - to preserve the peace , and to protect individuals &quot; reputations from lies . 
Most free societies accept such limits as reasonable . 
But the law has recently become more restrictive . 
&quot; Incitement to religious and racial hatred &quot; and &quot; incitement to hatred on the basis of sexual orientation &quot; are now illegal in most European countries , independent of any threat to public order . 
The law has shifted from proscribing language likely to cause violence to prohibiting language intended to give offense . 
A blatant example of this is the law against Holocaust denial . 
To deny or minimize the Holocaust is a crime in 15 European countries and Israel . 
It may be argued that the Holocaust was a crime so uniquely abhorrent as to qualify as a special case . 
France has made it illegal to deny any &quot; internationally recognized crimes against humanity . &quot; 
Whereas in Muslim countries it is illegal to call the Armenian massacres of 1915-1917 &quot; genocide , &quot; in some Western countries it is illegal to say that they were not . 
Some East European countries specifically prohibit the denial of communist &quot; genocides . &quot; 
The censorship of memory , which we once fondly imagined to be the mark of dictatorship , is now a major growth industry in the &quot; free &quot; West . 
Indeed , official censorship is only the tip of an iceberg of cultural censorship . 
A public person must be on constant guard against causing offense , whether intentionally or not . 
Breaking the cultural code damages a person &apos;s reputation , and perhaps one &apos;s career . 
Britain &apos;s Home Secretary Kenneth Clarke recently had to apologize for saying that some rapes were less serious than others , implying the need for legal discrimination . 
The parade of gaffes and subsequent groveling apologies has become a regular feature of public life . 
In his classic essay On Liberty , John Stuart Mill defended free speech on the ground that free inquiry was necessary to advance knowledge . 
Restrictions on certain areas of historical inquiry are based on the opposite premise : the truth is known , and it is impious to question it . 
This is absurd ; every historian knows that there is no such thing as final historical truth . 
It is not the task of history to defend public order or morals , but to establish what happened . 
Legally protected history ensures that historians will play safe . 
To be sure , living by Mill &apos;s principle often requires protecting the rights of unsavory characters . 
David Irving writes mendacious history , but his prosecution and imprisonment in Austria for &quot; Holocaust denial &quot; would have horrified Mill . 
By contrast , the pressure for &quot; political correctness &quot; rests on the argument that the truth is unknowable . 
Statements about the human condition are essentially matters of opinion . Because a statement of opinion by some individuals is almost certain to offend others , and since such statements make no contribution to the discovery of truth , their degree of offensiveness becomes the sole criterion for judging their admissibility . 
Hence the taboo on certain words , phrases , and arguments that imply that certain individuals , groups , or practices are superior or inferior , normal or abnormal ; hence the search for ever more neutral ways to label social phenomena , thereby draining language of its vigor and interest . 
A classic example is the way that &quot; family &quot; has replaced &quot; marriage &quot; in public discourse , with the implication that all &quot; lifestyles &quot; are equally valuable , despite the fact that most people persist in wanting to get married . 
It has become taboo to describe homosexuality as a &quot; perversion , &quot; though this was precisely the word used in the 1960 &quot; s by the radical philosopher Herbert Marcuse ( who was praising homosexuality as an expression of dissent ) . 
In today &apos;s atmosphere of what Marcuse would call &quot; repressive tolerance , &quot; such language would be considered &quot; stigmatizing . &quot; 
The sociological imperative behind the spread of &quot; political correctness &quot; is the fact that we no longer live in patriarchal , hierarchical , mono-cultural societies , which exhibit general , if unreflective , agreement on basic values . 
The pathetic efforts to inculcate a common sense of &quot; Britishness &quot; or &quot; Dutchness &quot; in multi-cultural societies , however well-intentioned , attest to the breakdown of a common identity . 
Public language has thus become the common currency of cultural exchange , and everyone is on notice to mind one &apos;s manners . 
The result is a multiplication of weasel words that chill political and moral debate , and that create a widening gap between public language and what many ordinary people think . 
The defense of free speech is made no easier by the abuses of the popular press . 
But investigative journalism becomes discredited when it is suborned to &quot; expose &quot; the private lives of the famous when no issue of public interest is involved . 
Entertaining gossip has mutated into an assault on privacy , with newspapers claiming that any attempt to keep them out of people &apos;s bedrooms is an assault on free speech . 
You know that a doctrine is in trouble when not even those claiming to defend it understand what it means . 
By that standard , the classic doctrine of free speech is in crisis . 
We had better sort it out quickly - legally , morally , and culturally - if we are to retain a proper sense of what it means to live in a free society .
