Barack Obama , Israel &apos;s True Friend 
HAIFA - How do you tell a true friend ? 
By the fact that he believes and has confidence in you , cares about your true needs , and honestly tells you your mistakes , which he tries to help you correct . 
That is the kind of friend I want at my side , not one who automatically approves of whatever I do , declares his love for me , and accepts me as I am . 
Ever since its great military victory in the Six-Day War of 1967 , when it repelled the combined armies of Egypt , Syria , and Jordan , which had openly proclaimed their desire to destroy the Jewish state , Israel has been in the throes of an ideological and military confusion resulting from the conquests it made during that conflict . 
Following the Six-Day War , Israel did not consider the conquered lands as something to be traded for peace , and thus induce the Arab world and the Palestinians to recognize its legitimacy and ensure the demilitarization of Palestinian territories after their restitution . 
Instead , Israel - either because of its distrust of its enemies and of their commitment to respect any future peace agreement , or because of a desire to annex some of the territories - began to pursue a policy of settlements . 
But , in doing so , it created a reality that is difficult to reverse . 
Israel &apos;s non-military settlements are , and have always been , irrelevant to the country &apos;s security . 
On the contrary , because the settlements are located in the heart of the Palestinian population , they are convenient targets for terrorist attacks and require special defensive measures , including the deployment of large military forces engaged in patrolling and surveillance . 
Even on the Golan Heights , where there is no Syrian presence , the settlements , located only a few kilometers from enormous Syrian troop concentrations , create a heavy burden , because , in the event of war , the Israeli army would be forced to evacuate them quickly , as was the case during the Yom Kippur war of October 1973 . 
The settlements intensify Palestinian hatred toward Israel . 
In addition to occupying Palestinians &quot; land , using their water , and imposing limits on their freedom of movement , the settlements symbolize Israel &apos;s intention to remain , and thus its reluctance to concede independence to the Palestinian people , even if they were to recognize Israel &apos;s legitimacy and show themselves disposed to peaceful coexistence . 
Israel has invested great financial resources in the settlements , often ignoring important needs in Israel proper . 
The settlers , predominantly supporters of religious-nationalist movements and parties , often flaunt an attitude of superiority in their relations with Israeli authorities , pretending to have a special status with respect not only to Palestinians , but also to other Israeli citizens . 
Indeed , a substantial number of them don &apos;t even recognize the Israeli state &apos;s legal authority . 
The greatest problem with the settlements is that if they continue to expand , the two-state solution will be compromised and , sooner or later , lead to a unitary state - one populated by two ethnic groups - between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea . 
Because simple demographic implies that Palestinians would gradually come to constitute a majority , a unitary state is a recipe for the end of Israel . 
The majority of Israelis understand this . 
We have made a mistake , and we have to remedy it before it &apos;s too late . &quot; 
To be sure , when a peace treaty was signed with Egypt , Jewish settlers were forcibly evacuated from the Sinai . 
Similarly , when Jewish communities in the Gaza Strip became unsupportable , the leader of the right , Ariel Sharon , forced out the 9,000 settlers who lived there among 1.5 million Palestinians - a dramatic event that has left deep scars on both sides . 
But there are 250,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank . 
Any attempt to evacuate them could escalate into a civil war . 
The world , including the United States , disapproves of the Israeli settlements . 
But , despite past US administrations &quot; opportunity to make their influence felt , they preferred to permit Israel , an allied , friendly state , to do what it wanted . 
So a moment of truth has arrived . 
Barack Obama , a wise and courageous leader , is - I have no doubt about it - not merely interested in improving America &apos;s image in the eyes of the Muslim world . 
He also seeks Israel &apos;s welfare and security , and says to us , &quot; Enough . 
Stop harming yourselves and your own future . 
Even if you don &apos;t believe in Palestinians &quot; real desire for peace , their capacity to hold terrorist organizations at bay , or their renunciation of the alleged right of return , you can always protect your security with a military presence in Palestinian territories rather than prejudicing the future peace and the two-state solution by expanding useless settlements . &quot; 
With such a clear and direct appeal to the Israeli government , America &apos;s president not only expresses what a majority of Israelis know . 
He also proves his profound friendship for the Jewish state .
