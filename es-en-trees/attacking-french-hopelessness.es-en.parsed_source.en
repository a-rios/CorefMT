Attacking French Hopelessness 
As French cities have burned , other countries have been very severe in judging France . 
Embassies have issued warnings to tourists and their citizens living in France ; television news programs have shown hours of footage of burning cars . 
Other countries &quot; governments , it seems , have been trying to distance themselves from the problem , fearing a contagion that they know is likely to spread . 
Mayors across Europe , however , have responded more moderately , feeling and showing solidarity with the plight of their French colleagues . 
They know that their cities are also vulnerable to urban violence , in so far as they have pockets of social inequality , including marginalized and excluded young people . 
The specificity of the French situation is that the revolt is targeted against the state , and more precisely against the police forces . 
Unlike recent riots in the United Kingdom , which were inter-ethnic , the confrontations in France put their participants face to face with the police . 
Indeed , there is no specific religious or ethnic character to these riots , in so far as youth from various ethnic backgrounds have taken part . 
Minority youth are , to be sure , over-represented among those involved . 
This is easily explained by their geographic segregation , higher levels of unemployment , higher school dropout rates , and disproportionately frequent interactions with the criminal justice system . 
But , in view of the diversity of the young people convicted so far , it would be a mistake to say that these riots are the result of Muslim radicalization . 
There is absolutely no indication so far that organized networks or religious groups are manipulating these youth . 
Of course , this is not to say that Muslim radicals will not exploit the disarray if a satisfying resolution is not found rapidly . 
The rioting may not be organized - no clear leaders or political demands have emerged . 
Yet these violent acts can be viewed as a political conflict in the sense that young people are directly challenging the state by attacking its representatives . 
The violence seems to be proportional to these disenfranchised young people &apos;s sense of perceived injustice and the lack of opportunities for them to express themselves . 
In this sense , France is paying the price for the lack of continuity , coherence , and appropriate funding given to social development policies over the past 30 years . 
Although these policies have undoubtedly helped residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods , they have not been sufficiently ambitious to dampen resentment . 
One example of overly timid policies involves policing . 
In the last few years , France has distinguished itself from other European nations by gradually abandoning community-based policing , which the government considers too &quot; social &quot; and prevention-oriented . 
While European police forces place prevention at the top of their agendas , France has chosen to treat it as a marginal goal . 
As a result , tensions between the police , who are increasingly perceived as &quot; outsiders , &quot; and residents have grown to all-time highs . 
In the absence of a community-based approach , interactions with law-enforcement authorities are now limited to tense , conflict-ridden situations , reinforcing the confrontational atmosphere between rebellious youth and the police . 
At the same time , the fact that police agents must intervene in places with which they are not familiar severely impedes their effectiveness . 
In the current violence , the police have unfortunately been placed in the position of sole representative of the state . 
But all public actors , not just the police , must respond to urban problems . 
First and foremost , mayors should be mobilized as mediators , because they are on the front line in implementing urban policy . 
When these policies fail , citizens hold mayors responsible . 
But mayors are also the most knowledgeable about communication links within their communities , and are thus the most capable of organizing effective partnerships to address and resolve local issues . 
The events in France also point to the need , at the European level , to reinforce policies against discrimination and that promote social equality . 
Although these policies must be implemented at a local level , they should be catalyzed and supported by European institutions . 
Efforts in this area already exist , but it has become increasingly urgent that these efforts be strengthened . 
Equality and social cohesion form the backbone of liberty , justice , and security for European cities . 
This is why Europe &apos;s mayors call upon European institutions to focus on social cohesion with the same commitment that has been invested until now in asylum and border controls .
