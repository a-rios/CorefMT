The Many Crises of Health Care 
PRINCETON - President Barack Obama &apos;s administration spent much of 2009 preoccupied domestically with the political fight over extending health insurance to the tens of millions of Americans who have none . 
People living in other industrialized countries find this difficult to understand . 
They have a right to health care , and even conservative governments do not attempt to take that right away . 
The difficulties that some Americans have with health-care reform tell us more about American hostility to government than it does about health care in general . 
But the debate in the United States highlights an underlying issue that will worry almost every developed country in 2010 and beyond : the struggle to control health-care costs . 
Health care now accounts for about one dollar in every six of all US spending - private as well as public - and is on track to double by 2035 . 
That is a greater share than in anywhere else in the world , but rising health-care costs are also a problem in countries that spend far less . 
There are many places where savings can be made . 
Encouraging people to exercise , to avoid smoking , to use alcohol only in moderation , and to eat less red meat would help to reduce health-care costs . 
But , given developed countries &quot; aging populations , the cost of caring for the elderly is bound to rise . 
So we will have to find other ways to save money . 
Here it makes sense to start at the end . 
Treating dying patients who do not want to go on living is a waste , yet only a few countries allow physicians actively to assist a patient who requests aid in dying . 
In the US , about 27 % of Medicare &apos;s budget goes towards care in the last year of life . 
While some of that is spent in the hope that the patient will have many years to live , it is not unusual for hospitals to provide treatments costing tens of thousands of dollars to patients who have no hope of living more than a week or two - and often under sedation or barely conscious . 
One factor in such decisions is fear on the part of doctors or hospitals that they will be sued by the family for letting their loved one die . 
So , for example , patients close to death are resuscitated , against the doctor &apos;s better judgment , because they have not specifically stated that they do not want to be resuscitated in such circumstances . 
The system by which doctors and hospitals are paid is another factor in providing expensive treatment that is of little benefit to the patient . 
When Intermountain Healthcare , a network of hospitals in Utah and Idaho , improved its treatment for premature babies , it reduced the time they spent in intensive care , thereby slashing the costs of treating them . 
But , because hospitals are paid a fee for each service they provide , and better care meant that the babies needed fewer services , the change cost the hospital network $ 329,000 a year . 
Even if such perverse incentives are removed , tougher questions about controlling costs need to be faced . 
One is the cost of new drugs . 
Development costs of $ 800 million are not unusual for a drug , and we can expect to see more of a new type of drug - biopharmaceuticals made from living cells - which cost even more . 
Development costs have to be passed on in drug prices , which may be exceptionally high when a drug benefits only a relatively small number of patients . 
Gaucher &apos;s disease , for example , is a rare crippling genetic condition that , in its more severe forms , usually killed its victims in childhood . 
Now those with the disease can lead an almost normal life , thanks to a drug called Cerezyme - but it costs $ 175,000 a year . 
New medical devices pose equally difficult dilemmas . 
The artificial heart machine , also known as a left ventricular assist device , or LVAD , has been used to keep patients alive until they receive a heart transplant . 
But there is a shortage of hearts for transplantation , and in the US , LVADs are now being implanted as a long-term treatment for heart failure , just as a dialysis machine replaces a kidney . 
According to Manoj Jain of Emory University , every year 200,000 US patients could be kept alive a little longer with an LVAD , at a cost of $ 200,000 per patient , or $ 40 billion . 
Is that a sensible use of resources in a country in which there are officially 39 million people below the poverty line , which for a family of four is $ 22,000 ? 
In countries that provide free health care to their citizens , it is extraordinarily difficult for officials to tell anyone that the government will not pay for the only drug or medical device that can save their life - or their child &apos;s life . 
But eventually the point will come when such things must be said . 
No one likes putting a dollar value on a human life , but the fact is that we already do , implicitly , by failing to give enough support to organizations working in developing countries . 
GiveWell.net , which evaluates organizations working to save the lives of the world &apos;s poor , has identified several that can save a life for under $ 1,000 . 
The World Health Organization estimates that its immunization programs in developing countries cost about $ 300 per life saved - lives that are saved not for a year , but usually for a lifetime . 
Similarly , the World Bank &apos;s Disease Control Priorities Report tells us that a program to treat tuberculosis in the developing world , promoted by the Stop TB Partnership , gives people an extra year of life at a cost ranging from $ 5 to $ 50 . 
Against that background , spending $ 200,000 to give a patient in an affluent country a relatively short period of extra life becomes more than financially dubious . 
It is morally wrong .
