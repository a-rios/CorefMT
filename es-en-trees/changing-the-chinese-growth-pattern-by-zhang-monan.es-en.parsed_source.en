The New Shape of China &apos;s Economy 
BEIJING - China &apos;s leadership transition attracted global attention in 2012 , and deservedly so , given the country &apos;s global significance . 
But , more important , strategic transformations now underway seem certain to influence its future pattern of growth . 
For three decades , the dividends from Deng Xiaoping &apos;s initial decision to open China &apos;s economy to market forces , and to the world , have fueled rapid growth . 
Until recently , the key was China &apos;s vast supply of low-cost labor , which provided the foundation for the country &apos;s export-oriented model . 
Concentrated in coastal China , this model produced an uneven distribution of output and established a unique pattern of high savings and low consumption . 
Indeed , China &apos;s savings rate of rose steadily following the onset of market reforms , from 38 % of GDP in 1978 to 51 % in 2007 . 
Economic growth is determined not only by factors of production such as labor , capital , and technology , but also by institutional arrangements . 
Through 30 years of reform , China has successfully completed the institutional transition from a highly centralized planned economy to a dynamic market-based system . 
Beginning from rural tiered management based on the household contract system , Chinese reformers supplemented public ownership with various other forms , with the market increasingly playing its fundamental role in allocating resources under the macro control of the state . 
Reform coincided with increasing globalization , unleashing forces that restructured not only Chinese industry , but also production processes around the world as China challenged established manufacturers and became part of global supply chains . 
Developed economies &quot; massive outsourcing of traditional manufacturing , high-tech manufacturing , and even some low-end services has brought exciting opportunities for emerging markets that , like China , have resource and cost advantages , strong market potential , and industrial support capabilities . 
Today , however , the catalytic power of Deng &apos;s initial changes has waned , with rising wages , weakening external demand , and increasing competition from other emerging economies indicating the exhaustion of a growth model premised on exports and investment . 
In particular , the 2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent eurozone debt crisis have forced Chinese officials to forge a new path for future growth . 
Most important , export-led growth must give way to domestic economic drivers . 
This implies the need to upgrade China &apos;s industrial structure , accelerate the formation of human capital , facilitate technological progress , and undertake further institutional reforms . 
If successfully implemented , this agenda is likely to reverse global savings and consumption patterns that have underpinned large imbalances in recent years . 
China is responsible for the savings side , while the US disproportionately accounts for the consumption side , ultimately turning the Chinese into America &apos;s creditors . 
Of course , global savings and consumption patterns have undergone significant change since the financial crisis , with both the West and China trying to restore internal equilibrium . 
Doubling average household income by 2020 - the target set at the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s 18th Congress in November - is likely to release 64 trillion renminbi ( $ 10.3 trillion ) in purchasing power , with China &apos;s huge internal market gradually becoming a new long-term driver of domestic and international growth . 
This model presupposes that China will develop domestic capital , rather than simply relying on foreign investment . 
To be sure , the ability to attract and absorb external financing has been an important reason for China &apos;s accelerated industrialization , marketization , and integration into the global economy . 
Thirty years ago , this was the most efficient and practical strategic choice for China , owing to its lack of capital and advanced technology . 
But a country &apos;s economic development ultimately depends on its ability to accumulate capital and allocate it efficiently . 
With 90 trillion renminbi in banking assets and $ 3.2 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves , China is now playing a significant role in global finance . 
And yet the high volume and inferior quality of these assets have also posed challenges to the country &apos;s ability to complete the transition from trade power to financial power , and thus to exploit the competitive advantages of Chinese capital . 
After three decades of growth on a scale unprecedented in human history , China &apos;s new leaders are facing a historical turning point . 
Whether China successfully changes its economic model ultimately will determine its prospects not only for further growth , but also for continued stability .
