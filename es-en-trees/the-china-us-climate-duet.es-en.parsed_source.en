The China-US Climate Duet 
BEIJING - Without active collaboration between the United States and China , not only will the odds for successful negotiations in Copenhagen this December to secure a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol be diminished , but it will be unlikely that any meaningful remedy will be found in time to arrest rising global temperatures . 
Yet talks between the US and China on climate change currently present two contrasting scenarios , one hopeful , the other discouraging . 
In the first scenario , the two countries &quot; senior delegations remain deadlocked , with their polarized stances frozen in place . 
Moreover , the failure of developed countries - particularly , the US - to take responsibility for their historical emissions of greenhouse gases continues , representing a major sticking point because these emissions far surpass those of the developing world . 
In the second scenario , billions of dollars in &quot; green &quot; stimulus packages trigger a global race that leads to new energy technologies and their deployment . 
The US becomes focused on leading in six key clean-tech areas : building efficiency , battery technology , solar , carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) , smart grids , and electric vehicles ( EV ) . 
These efforts are mirrored by Chinese initiatives in such fields as new low-energy vehicles ; light-emitting diode ( LED ) lighting ; building integrated photovoltaic ( BIPV ) ; innovative energy efficiency technologies ; and various alternative energy sources such as solar , wind , bio-gas , and synthetic fuels . 
Both countries express a determination to find collaborative ways to restructure their energy mixes with new , low-carbon energy technologies . 
Given the stakes , it is perhaps understandable why the US and China are holding their climate-change cards close to their chests . 
Right now , each side is emerging from a period in which they used the other as an excuse for inaction , but have nonetheless now actively started to explore which scenario to follow . 
The nature of these two countries &quot; bilateral engagement will dictate how the low-carbon economic &quot; pie &quot; will get carved up , and thus how fast the global economy as a whole can be transformed . 
Responsibility for this transformation lies irrevocably with China and the US , not only because they are the world &apos;s biggest emitters , but also because only they have the capacity to invest enough in clean-tech Rampamp ; D , provide a large enough labor force , and support a large enough change in global policy . 
So the future of the world &apos;s climate rests not just on their shoulders individually , but on their ability to work together . 
Both sides agree that their roles are critical . 
Indeed , climate change is now included in all major bilateral discussions , alongside trade , exchange rates , human rights , and energy security . 
And recent exchanges and visits seem to give some cause for optimism . 
But climate change represents China &apos;s toughest challenge in international relations since the Cold War &apos;s end . 
Not only has China recently become the world &apos;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases , but the pace of its future emissions is expected to far exceed forecasts . 
At the same time , China remains a vast developing country , ardently seeking more rapid economic growth to lift hundreds of millions out of poverty and to provide better living standards for hundreds of millions more . 
Balancing its need for growth with climate protection makes China &apos;s role precarious . 
The global financial crisis complicates matters further . 
Even though parts of both the developed and the developing world increasingly look to China for leadership , the country &apos;s leaders view such a global role as beyond their current capabilities . 
Yet , China has come a long way from the days of the Kyoto Protocol . 
Like many developing countries , China was more or less dragged along in that process . 
It did sign the Kyoto agreement , albeit as an &quot; Annex I state , &quot; meaning that it did not commit to any defined limits on carbon emissions . 
But China &apos;s views have evolved . 
The biggest milestone came in December 2007 , when it , along with other developing countries , signed the Bali Roadmap , agreeing to work together on a new global deal by 2009 in Copenhagen . 
Today , China actively and constructively participates in the global talks , discussing , for example , what it has been doing to cut emissions per unit of GDP . 
( It has made an ambitious commitment in its 11th Five-Year Plan to a 20 % reduction in energy intensity and attain a 10 % increase in renewable energy by 2010 . ) 
Reaction to these changes from the international community has been largely positive . 
Indeed , last March , US Climate Envoy Todd Stern began to speak positively about China &apos;s domestic efforts to address climate change . 
But this does not mean that agreement is in the offing . 
According to the Kyoto Protocol , what China , as a &quot; developing &quot; country , and the US , as a &quot; developed &quot; country , are required to do is completely different . 
Unlike China , the US must commit to absolute limits on emissions . 
So China would like to see the US lead in making such a commitment , without using China as an excuse for inaction . 
As a developing country that has throughout history emitted only one-fifth of the CO2 emitted by the US , China insists that it has the moral right to resist calls to take the lead . 
With a few months remaining before the Copenhagen talks , China is expected to deliver its commitment to the Bali Action Plan . 
It will , of course , be a far lower commitment than that expected from the European Union or the US . 
If the US is serious about reaching a constructive outcome in Copenhagen , it must set radical and practical targets , take responsibility for its historic carbon emissions , and commit itself to support developing countries &quot; efforts by means of capacity building , technology transfer , and finance . 
Only then will the developing world view the US as truly willing to assume its role as a global leader .
