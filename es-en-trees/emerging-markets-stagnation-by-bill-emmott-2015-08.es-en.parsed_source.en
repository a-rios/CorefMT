The Great Emerging-Market Bubble 
LONDON - Something has gone badly wrong in the emerging economies that were supposed to be shaping , even dominating , the future of the world . 
The search for culprits is under way : commodity prices , fracking , US interest rates , El Nino , China , these and others lead the field . 
But the answer is simpler and more traditional . 
There an economy once tipped for ever-lasting boom has barely grown for more than two years , and is currently shrinking . 
Falling prices for its commodity exports haven &apos;t helped , but Brazil &apos;s economy was supposed to be about far more than just harvests and extractive industries . 
Or look at Indonesia . 
That economy is still expanding , but at a rate - 4.7 % annually in the latest quarter - that is disappointing in terms both of previous expectations and of population growth . 
The same can be said of Turkey , where growth has sagged to 2.3 % in the latest quarter - which at least beats population growth but is meager compared with the country &apos;s go-go years of 2010 and 2011 , when it expanded by 9 % . 
Or South Africa , where economic progress has constantly been too slow , whether in boom years for gold and other resources or busts , to make any real dent in poverty levels . 
Then there is China itself , whose slowdown is everybody else &apos;s favorite explanation for their own sluggishness . 
There , private economists are back enjoying their favorite pastime during periods of economic stress , namely trying to construct their own indices for GDP growth as at such times they do not believe the official statistics . 
Officially , Chinese growth is rock-steady at 7 % per year , which happens to be the government &apos;s declared target , but private economists &quot; estimates mostly range between 4 % and 6 % . 
One mantra of recent years has been that , whatever the twists and turns of global economic growth , of commodities or of financial markets , &quot; the emerging-economy story remains intact . &quot; 
By this , corporate boards and investment strategists mean that they still believe that emerging economies are destined to grow a lot faster than the developed world , importing technology and management techniques while exporting goods and services , thereby exploiting a winning combination of low wages and rising productivity . 
There is , however , a problem with this mantra , beyond the simple fact that it must by definition be too general to cover such a wide range of economies in Asia , Latin America , Africa , and Eastern Europe . 
It is that if convergence and outperformance were merely a matter of logic and destiny , as the idea of an &quot; emerging-economy story &quot; implies , then that logic ought also to have applied during the decades before developing-country growth started to catch the eye . 
But it didn &apos;t . 
The reason why it didn &apos;t is the same reason why so many emerging economies are having trouble now . 
More precisely , although countries can ride waves of growth and exploit commodity cycles despite having dysfunctional political institutions , the real test comes when times turn less favorable and a country needs to change course . 
That is what Brazil has been finding so difficult for the past four disappointing years . 
Unable to keep inflation under control without causing a recession , the country has , since 2010 , got stuck not because of bad luck , or any loss of entrepreneurial spirit in its private sector , but because of political failings . 
Brazil &apos;s government has been unwilling or unable to cut back its bloated public sector , has been mired in vast corruption scandals , and yet its president Dilma Rousseff continues to evince a fondness for just the sort of state-led capitalism that leads to exactly these problems . 
The democracies of Brazil , Indonesia , Turkey , and South Africa are all currently failing to perform what is a basic task for any political system : to mediate smoothly between competing interest groups and power blocs in order to permit a broader public interest to prevail . 
By that is meant essentially a public interest in allowing the economy to evolve flexibly , so that resources move from uses that have become unprofitable to ones that have a higher potential . 
A clogged up economy , one that does not permit such creative destruction and adaptation to new circumstances , is one that will not grow sustainably . 
Is this something that democracies , especially immature ones with fragile institutions of the rule of law and freedom of speech , are simply bad at , when compared with authoritarian regimes ? 
Certainly , what these stumbling economies are guilty of is a failure to learn from Singapore , a system whose managed democracy is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year , and which has successfully avoided the sort of interest-group sclerosis and corruption that is holding back Brazil , for example . 
One comfort , perhaps , for the democrats is that right now China is failing to learn the Singaporean lesson , too . 
Its current slowdown appears to arise from a failure by the Communist Party to challenge the monopoly powers of state-owned enterprises and to free up new sectors for private enterprise . 
It is not a question of whether democracy or authoritarianism is best . 
The bottom line is that unless emerging economies can ensure that they remain flexible and adaptable , they will not continue to &quot; emerge . &quot; 
And the determinant of that flexibility and ability to adapt lies in political institutions and their willingness to challenge interest groups , mediate social conflicts , and maintain the rule of law . 
It &apos;s the politics , stupid .
