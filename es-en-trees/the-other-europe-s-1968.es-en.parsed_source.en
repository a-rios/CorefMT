The Other Europe &apos;s 1968 
WARSAW - In Paris , West Berlin , London , and Rome , the spring of 1968 was marked by student protests against the Vietnam War . 
In Warsaw , too , students were protesting , but their cause was not the same as their Western counterparts . 
Young Poles took to the streets of Warsaw not to chant &quot; Ho , Ho , Ho Chi Minh &quot; in solidarity with the Viet Cong , but rather to defend their own country &apos;s freedom and culture against a smothering Communist rule . 
Instead of chanting Ho &apos;s name , young Poles put flowers under the monument of Adam Mickiewicz , a nineteenth-century poet whose drama Forefathers Eve , written in praise of the struggle for freedom , had recently been declared subversive and anti-Soviet , and its performance at the National Theater in Warsaw closed down . 
These are only a few of the differences between West and East European students in that springtime of rebellion of forty years ago . 
Although the two youthful revolts were undertaken by the same generation and took similar forms of street demonstrations and sit-ins , there were far more differences than similarities as students rebelled on both sides of the Iron Curtain . 
It was , of course , the context that made the difference . 
The point of departure for Western students - freedom of speech and assembly , ideological pluralism , and a democratic political system - was , for their Eastern colleagues , a distant objective that they were unlikely to achieve . 
Unhappy with the capitalist consumer society that was metastasizing all around them , West European and American students attacked the system from far-left positions . 
Polish , Czechoslovak , and Yugoslav students directed their protests against the Communist dictatorship , which was depriving their societies of elementary civic freedoms . 
For the Westerners , the main threat was American imperialism , blamed for the &quot; dirty &quot; war in Vietnam . 
For the Poles and other Easterners , the threat was Soviet imperialism - a threat soon realized in Brezhnev &apos;s crushing of the Prague Spring . 
While the former wanted a revolution , the latter demanded only - but no less audaciously - that the authorities obey the law . 
&quot; The press lies ! &quot; demonstrators shouted in Warsaw and burned Party-controlled newspapers . 
For Wladyslaw Gomulładyslaw Gomułka , then Poland &apos;s Party leader , and other Communist brass , free media was a bourgeois aberration . 
That same spring , demonstrators in Paris burned cars in opposition to the bourgeois lifestyle . 
What you see depends on where you sit . 
While students in Paris and Berkeley turned against academic science , their contemporaries in Warsaw and other Polish cities demonstrated in defense of the traditional role of the university and its autonomy , and were supported by many of their professors . 
Unlike in the West , intergenerational conflict played a minor role in the Polish 1968 . 
Writers and scientists , who were also enraged by official censorship of Mickiewicz &apos;s play and national culture , joined the young in protest . 
The student movement in Poland took on a mass character during a demonstration at the University of Warsaw on March 8 , 1968 . 
Students united to support two of their colleagues who had been expelled for their protests at the National Theater . 
One student was Adam Michnik , later a long-term political prisoner , who became a political strategist of Solidarity in the 1980 &quot; s . 
The peaceful demonstration was brutally dispersed by the police and &quot; volunteer &quot; party vigilantes . 
No dialogue was ever sought . 
In violation of a centuries-long tradition of university autonomy , the police marched onto campus , beat up students , and arrested a large number of demonstrators . 
In response , a wave of protests spread to universities around the country , often supported by young workers . 
Mendacity in the Communist press , which distorted the protests &quot; meaning and personally attacked student leaders , inflamed matters more . 
The party resorted to anti-Semitic propaganda , pointing to the Jewish ancestry of some of the student leaders . 
The campaign of hatred that followed underscored the country &apos;s utter lack of free speech . 
The demand for the abolition of censorship was one of the first political slogans of the Polish March &quot; 68 . 
Demands for freedom of assembly and the right to organize followed . 
Crucially , the protesters did not demand free elections . 
In this they were realists , but they did demand a measure of civic control over the authorities , both in the political and the economic sphere . 
One slogan was &quot; No bread without freedom . &quot; 
After 1968 , Western student protestors gradually entered their countries &quot; political and intellectual establishments . 
The Polish dissidents found themselves in prison or exile . 
Several thousand were expelled from universities , and 80 were imprisoned following political trials . 
The authorities also sacked prominent professors who had influenced and supported the students . 
The regime &apos;s darkest response , an anti-Semitic purge , resulted in an exodus of more than 10,000 people , who were also deprived of their citizenship . 
The springtime of protests that many in the West remember fondly led to very different outcomes . 
Anti-capitalist radicalism pushed many Western protesters toward the extreme left , rejection of liberal democracy , and , in some cases , terrorism . 
The ideological evolution of the Polish students led in the opposite direction - from efforts to &quot; improve &quot; socialism in the name of &quot; true &quot; Marxism to anti-totalitarian opposition and the construction of a free civil society . 
Imprisonment completed the evolution of the March combatants and left them free of illusions . 
In the 1970 &quot; s , they created the biggest center of opposition in the socialist &quot; camp . &quot; 
The Solidarity movement of the 1980 &quot; s and the peaceful overthrow of communism was , in large measure , the work of their generation . 
It was the only suitable end to the road begun in 1968 under the monument of Mickiewicz .
