Mazowiecki &apos;s Miracle 
WARSAW - It was a hot day and a tense moment . 
As Poland &apos;s first post-communist prime minister , Tadeusz Mazowiecki , laid out his government &apos;s ground-breaking program , he wobbled and appeared to faint . 
While the packed parliament speculated nervously , Mazowiecki slipped out of a side entrance to get some fresh air in nearby Ujazdowski Park in central Warsaw . 
&quot; Who &apos;s that ? &quot; a child playing in a sandbox asked his mother . 
&quot; Nasz premier , &quot; she replied - &quot; Our prime minister . &quot; 
That was not a phrase that had been readily used to describe Poland &apos;s Communist leaders over the previous four decades . 
When Mazowiecki returned to the podium , he apologized and , with his customary dry wit , suggested that the Polish economy was as unsteady on its feet as he was . 
He was right . 
Communism had left Poland politically and economically bankrupt . 
Marxist ideology had become all but a façade ; not even party apparatchiks pretended to believe it . 
Poland &apos;s economy , close to outright collapse , struggled to meet citizens &quot; basic needs , let alone repay foreign loans . 
It fell to the Catholic journalist and opposition activist Mazowiecki to be modern Poland &apos;s first non-Communist prime minister and to start the road to recovery . 
Though he was in office for less than 17 months , from August 1989 to January 1991 , he managed to set Poland on a path toward a market economy and NATO and European Union membership . 
In the final weeks of Communist rule , Mazowiecki helped to establish a model for negotiated political transition that still informs , inspires , and guides other societies on the cusp of change . 
I am proud that Poland , thanks to the expertise gained in the Mazowiecki years and after , can provide advice to the European Union &apos;s eastern and southern neighbors , as well as countries like Tunisia and Burma . 
The gaunt , gentlemanly Mazowiecki had served as an adviser to Lech Wałęsa , the leader of the Solidarity movement . 
He had seen the movement swell to more than nine million members in the heady days after the August 1980 Gdansk Shipyard strike - and , like the rest of the movement &apos;s leadership , had been interned when General Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law and banned Solidarity 16 months later . 
The union survived as an underground operation , printing discussion documents and organizing rallies . 
Gradually , the balance of advantage swung away from the Communist leadership - especially after Mikhail Gorbachev took over as Soviet leader - and back toward Solidarity . 
Exhausted , the Polish Communist regime agreed to sit down to talks with Solidarity . 
The negotiations , known as the Round Table Talks , led to the Communist world &apos;s first competitive - though not entirely free - parliamentary election , on June 4 , 1989 . 
Five months before the fall of the Berlin Wall and Czechoslovakia &apos;s Velvet Revolution , Poland had negotiated its way out of totalitarianism . 
But the Mazowiecki government faced a nearly impossible task : building democratic political institutions while resuscitating the country &apos;s torpid economy . 
One of the Mazowiecki team &apos;s greatest achievements was the introduction , led by Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz , of fast and far-reaching market reforms and privatization . 
The &quot; shock therapy &quot; of the Balcerowicz Plan unsettled Poles , but it brought the country &apos;s terrifyingly high inflation under control . 
Mazowiecki backed Balcerowicz , and the success of economic reform underpinned Poland &apos;s relatively smooth political transition . 
Indeed , despite some initial hiccups , the positive effects of economic reform quickly became apparent . 
Poland recorded impressive growth . 
Within 20 years , GDP increased four-fold , while exports increased more than ten-fold . 
Once a peripheral European country economically and politically , Poland has become one of Europe &apos;s leading states and a co-shaper of its future . 
The Round Table Talks and the political transition overseen by Mazowiecki marked a period of compromise that had advantages and disadvantages . 
The advantages included a rapid political changeover and the assistance of some of the former Communist elite in building a free , democratic , and pro-Western state . 
The disadvantages included the lack of a clean break between Poland &apos;s authoritarian past and its democratic present . 
The price of a smooth transition was also that many members of the Communist regime - including Jaruzelski - were not held accountable for their crimes while in power . 
At the time , I was critical of the path Mazowiecki was taking . 
I believed that Poland &apos;s transformation could be accomplished faster and more effectively . 
But this never tarnished my high opinion of him . 
On the contrary , looking back on that era , it is amazing how much was achieved within such a short amount of time . 
Together with Wałęsa , Mazowiecki was a founder of Polish independence . 
His place in the history books is guaranteed . 
It is thanks to him that Poles can be proud that theirs was the first Soviet Bloc country to free itself of Communist tyranny . 
We have not looked back since .
