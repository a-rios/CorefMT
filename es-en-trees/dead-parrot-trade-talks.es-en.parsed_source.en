Dead Parrot Trade Talks 
NEW YORK - The Doha Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations ( MTN ) is the first negotiation to take place under the auspices of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , founded in 1995 . 
The eight previous rounds of global trade talks were conducted under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , following its creation in 1947 . 
The previous MTN , the Uruguay Round , took nearly eight years to complete , causing some to quip that GATT stood for the General Agreement to Talk and Talk . 
But the jokes about the Doha Round , which is in its tenth year , are far worse - akin to the classic Monty Python sketch in which a customer holds up a dead parrot in a cage while the shopkeeper insists that the parrot is only &quot; resting . &quot; 
When the parrot drops off its perch in the cage , the customer insists that it is now clear that the parrot is dead . 
The shopkeeper , however , insists that the bird is only &quot; stunned &quot; by the fall . 
Increasingly , political leaders like British Prime Minister David Cameron , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , who spoke eloquently for the Round at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year , are emphasizing that the Doha Round &apos;s failure would cost the world significant gains in prosperity , halt progress for the poor in developing countries , and reduce workers &quot; real incomes in developed countries . 
A Doha failure would also deal a lethal blow to the credibility and future of the WTO , which has been an almost unique example of effective and democratic multilateralism . 
Just as the economist Lester Thurow famously declared at Davos in 1988 that &quot; GATT is dead , &quot; the current refrain is that the WTO is Monty Python &apos;s parrot . 
Given the stakes for the global economy , the Doha Round must be saved . 
The High-level Trade Group , co-chaired by myself and Peter Sutherland , argued at Davos that this can best be achieved through a high-stakes gamble of announcing a date - such as the end of 2011 - by which the negotiations are declared completed or the parrot is knocked off its perch . 
But the next question is this : how do pro-trade and pro-Doha leaders such as Cameron and Merkel bring the foot-draggers on board ? 
While many players , including Brazil , China , and the European Union , must make marginal concessions to close Doha , the focus will have to be on the principal naysayers . 
The talks broke down in mid-2008 , owing to the United States &quot; refusal to reduce agricultural subsidies further and India &apos;s refusal to ask its subsistence farmers to compete with subsidized US farmers . 
But the main problem since then has come from the US . 
President Barack Obama is presumably sympathetic to openness in trade . 
He cannot have spent a decade teaching at the University of Chicago without being persuaded that trade is beneficial . 
Even during his campaign for the Democratic Party nomination , when his main rival , Hillary Clinton , was pushing to suspend trade negotiations and had embraced the protectionist narrative , Obama kept his cool and promised instead to reopen NAFTA - a tactic designed to amount to nothing , as it has . 
But the Democrats in Congress who won in 2008 were financed by labor unions , which are fearful of trade , chiefly with developing countries . 
They have constrained Obama &apos;s willingness to embrace trade deals . 
Obama &apos;s loss of support from his party &apos;s left wing , which has been alienated by his compromises over Guant√°namo , Iraq , Afghanistan , and even health-care reform , has also played a part . 
Few of these officials are willing to battle for trade , having reconciled their supposed concern for the poor with a deplorable willingness to deny developing countries access to the US and other rich markets that can help them earn their way out of poverty . 
Indeed , they now claim , astonishingly , that trade actually harms the poor in poor countries ! 
Last November &apos;s elections changed for the better the politics of trade , as the Republican Party is now in the majority in the US House of Representatives . 
Trade negotiations are supposedly acceptable again . 
Obama has already offered a pre-emptive concession on a free-trade agreement with South Korea . 
With this FTA practically in the bag , the Republicans now want to see FTAs with Colombia and Panama put into that bag . 
Regrettably , neither they nor the President have asked that Doha also be put into the bag . 
At long last , this is surely the opportunity for pro-Doha statesmen worldwide to pressure both Obama and the Republican leadership into doing so . 
To neglect this window of opportunity would be tragic .
