The Global Jobs Challenge 
NEW YORK - Over the past three decades , hundreds of millions of new workers have entered the global economy . 
They arrived with various levels of education and skill , and over time have generally gained in terms of &quot; human capital &quot; - and in terms of value added and income . 
This has brought a tremendous , and ongoing , growth in income levels , opportunities , and the size of the global economy . 
But these new workers have also brought more employment competition and significant shifts in relative wages and prices , which is having profound distributional effects . 
These massive structural changes in the global economy present three great employment challenges worldwide , with different countries facing their own variants . 
The first challenge is to generate enough jobs to accommodate the inflow of new entrants into the labor market . 
Clearly , a wide range of advanced and developing countries is failing to do so . 
Youth unemployment is high and rising . 
Even in fast-growth developing countries , surplus labor is awaiting inclusion in the modern economy , and the pressure is on to sustain job creation . 
The second challenge is to match skills and capabilities to the supply of jobs - an adjustment that takes time . 
Globalization and major labor-saving technologies have thrown labor markets in many countries into disequilibrium . 
Skills mismatches abound . 
Moreover , with continuing rapid growth in developing countries , the global economy &apos;s structure is far from static , and it seems clear that the pace of market adjustment is lagging that of structural change . 
The third challenge is distributional . 
As the tradable part of the global economy ( goods and services that can be produced in one country and consumed in another ) expands , competition for economic activity and jobs broadens . 
That affects the price of labor and the range of employment opportunities within all globally integrated economies . 
Subsets of the population gain , and others lose , certainly relative to expectations - and often absolutely . 
Many advanced countries - in fact , most of them - have experienced limited middle-income growth . 
In some European countries , where income inequality has remained in check , this has been a component of a deliberate strategy to maintain employment growth and competitiveness in the tradable part of the economy , with wage restraint partly shared across the income distribution . 
In the United States , income inequality has risen as the upper end of the income and education spectrum benefits from globalization , while the rest experience declining employment opportunities in the tradable sector . 
For two decades prior to the 2008 crisis , employment levels were maintained - and downward pressure on incomes mitigated - by creating jobs in non-tradable sectors . 
In some cases , this took the form of rapid growth in government ; in others , like the US , a pattern of excessive , debt-fueled consumption underpinned a large shift in employment to ( non-tradable ) services and construction . 
Indeed , government and health care ( both largely non-tradable ) accounted for almost 40 % of net employment growth in the US between 1990 and 2008 . 
That pattern came to a sudden stop in the financial crisis of 2008 . 
Private-sector leverage declined and public-sector leverage reached - and exceeded - sustainable limits , with Greece being only the most extreme example . 
But expectations created by pre-crisis growth patterns adjust slowly . 
Because the dominant narrative still maintains that the pre-crisis period was normal , at least in terms of the growth pattern in the real economy , the perceived challenge is to restore growth according to the pre-crisis pattern . 
Unfortunately , this narrative cannot explain why , particularly in the advanced countries , growth is faltering and the employment engines have largely shut down . 
Part of the answer consists in the long , lingering impact of financial crises and deleveraging , well documented by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff in their book This Time is Different . 
At the same time , the financial imbalances and distortions that precede a crisis delay appropriate and necessary responses to technological and global market forces in the real economy as well . 
In short , economies and policies adjusted in an unsustainable fashion , to some extent obscuring the need for a more sustainable pattern of adaptation . 
What does it mean - for individuals , businesses , and governments - that structural adjustment is falling further and further behind the global forces that are causing pressure for structural change ? 
Above all , it means that expectations are broadly inconsistent with reality , and need to adjust , in some cases downward . 
But distributional effects need to be taken seriously and addressed . 
The burden of weak or non-existent recoveries should not be borne by the unemployed , including the young . 
In the interest of social cohesion , market outcomes need to be modified to create a more even distribution of incomes and benefits , both now and in inter-temporal terms . 
After all , underinvestment now implies diminished opportunity in the future . 
The imperative of structural adjustment also implies that individuals , governments , and other institutions ( especially schools ) need to focus on increasing the speed of adjustment to meet rapidly shifting market conditions . 
Attention to both the demand and supply sides of job markets is required . 
This means not only matching skills to jobs , but also expanding the range of jobs to match skills . 
Finally , global economic-management institutions need to address whether the pace of globalization , and its implied structural change , is faster than the capacity of individuals , economies , and societies to adjust can withstand . 
If so , the next challenge will be to find non-destructive ways to moderate the pace in order to bring capacity to adjust and the need for adjustment into closer alignment . 
None of this will be easy . 
We do not now have well developed frameworks for understanding structural change . 
Nevertheless , the unemployed and underemployed , especially younger people , expect their leaders and institutions to try .
