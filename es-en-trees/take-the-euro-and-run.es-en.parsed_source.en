Take the Euro and Run 
For the eight post-communist countries that the EU promises to admit in 2004 , joining its Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) poses an accompanying obligation . 
Unlike the United Kingdom or Denmark , the new members cannot opt out of the euro . 
They can only control when to adopt it , which in principle could be as early as two years after EU admission . 
Obviously , accepting the Maastricht Treaty , with its tough constraints on fiscal , monetary , and wage policies , is far more than an economic decision . 
But in the final analysis , the conviction - or lack of it - that joining EMU will bring powerful economic benefits is the force likely to guide decisions about whether to embrace the euro as soon as possible . 
EMU is founded on the idea , pioneered by the Nobel laureate Robert Mundell , that the costs and benefits of monetary integration depend on whether or not countries share certain properties . 
A group of countries characterized by economic openness , trade and financial market integration , similar economic structures , price and wage flexibility , labor mobility and other factors of production may , according to this view , form an optimum currency area ( OCA ) . 
Do the post-communist candidate countries share the OCA properties required for successful EMU membership ? 
Their degree of economic openness , measured by the share of exports and imports in their GDP , is as high as that of current EMU members . 
This is vital , because the more open an economy , the more the prices of internationally traded goods determine domestic inflation , thus making an independent exchange rate policy less necessary for influencing relative prices and competitiveness . 
Similarly , trade integration and comparable economic structures tend to synchronize the business cycles of member countries , making common monetary and exchange rate policies more likely to serve the interests of all . 
Trade integration can be measured by the EU &apos;s share in a country &apos;s exports . 
For all but three candidate countries , this is more than 60 % , and often larger than for current EU members . 
Economic structure reflects the contributions of different sectors of the economy to GDP and employment . 
The economic structures of the four candidates who are OECD members ( the Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , and Slovakia ) are similar to today &apos;s EMU members , although industry &apos;s share in GDP is higher and that of services lower . 
Employment patterns also reflect the legacy of central planning , with industrial employment higher than in the EMU . 
Still , all indicators show that the candidate countries are closely integrated financially with the EU , permitting them to run higher current account deficits than they could otherwise . 
In Hungary , non-residents hold 20 % of government securities and account for 70 % of the equity market &apos;s capitalization . 
Of 31 commercial banks , only five are domestically owned . 
Foreign owners - mostly EU-based banks - now control roughly 95 % of assets in the Czech and Slovak banking sectors . 
The candidate countries also display greater flexibility of nominal prices and wages . 
A recent OECD study measuring regulation of product markets and employment protection in member countries indicates that the Czechs , Hungarians , and Poles are more committed to removing price controls , facilitating entrepreneurship , and liberalizing labor markets than many EU members . 
This dampens the need for the exchange rate to function as a mechanism of adjustment for potential shocks . 
Throughout Europe , cross-country labor mobility is hampered by cultural and language barriers , limited portability of social benefits , and administrative restrictions . 
But the importance of labor mobility for a currency union should not be exaggerated . 
It would be impractical and socially undesirable to depend on labor mobility to help overcome temporary shocks , and an independent monetary policy can do little to address the permanent shocks that labor mobility can ameliorate . 
In the end , mobility of capital compensates for lower labor mobility . 
So current EMU members and EU candidate countries clearly share OCA properties . 
But a successful currency union requires more than this . 
For example , if the transmission mechanism of monetary policy varies among countries , their responses to a common policy may also vary . 
Factors affecting the transmission mechanism in the candidate countries - legal frameworks , the degree of financial depth , the maturity of debts , and the availability of non-bank financing - differ markedly from those in the current EMU members . 
But such differences exist within the EMU as well , while the effects of short-term interest rate changes on output and prices are nonetheless fairly similar . 
Yet the degree of many candidate countries &apos; economic openness has narrowed the scope for independent monetary policy . 
Vast amounts of short-term capital , speculating on interest rate convergence or equity market gains , are flowing into the most advanced candidate countries , driving up their currencies and increasing their vulnerability to a sudden capital-flow reversal . 
EMU membership will diminish this volatility and eliminate exposure to it . 
Even if EMU membership did not promise a more stable and competitive business environment , increased efficiency , and faster growth throughout the enlarged euro area , minimizing exposure to financial contagion is reason enough to join as soon as possible . 
Markets can be a brutal and disruptive teacher , as we know from the monetary crises that wracked developing countries in the 1990s . 
By eliminating nominal exchange rate uncertainty , a common currency area has the additional benefit of lowering transaction costs and investment risks . 
Economists disagree over how much this increases trade . 
But the effect on output growth , which is what matters in the end , is bigger the more open an economy is - one more way that the candidate countries could gain considerably from early EMU membership .
