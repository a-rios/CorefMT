China &apos;s Growth Challenge 
BEIJING - Throughout the just concluded 18th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party ubiquitous television screens in trains and metro stations broadcast a live feed of the Chinese assembly . 
Beijing &apos;s busy people , however , seemed not to pay close attention : for them , it was business as usual . 
The Chinese public &apos;s indifference to their country &apos;s ceremonial transition of power is hardly surprising . 
All critical decisions were taken well ahead of the Congress , behind closed doors , with very little input from outsiders . 
This apparently seamless transition , however , is widely expected to usher in a complex and potentially difficult decade for China - and for the rest of the world . 
China is at a turning point . 
With more than 100 million people still below the official poverty line and per capita income currently just over $ 6,000 in nominal terms , robust economic growth must be maintained . 
Outgoing President Hu Jintao indicated that China &apos;s total GDP and per capita income should double by 2020 , which will require 7.5 % average annual growth . 
Is this feasible ? 
Recent improvements in data for industrial production , fixed investment , and retail sales suggest that the Chinese economy , which had slowed in recent quarters , may already be on the mend . 
However , as things stand , most independent economists expect 7-7.5 % annual GDP in 2013-2017 , while the International Monetary Fund forecasts a more optimistic 8.2-8.5 % rate during this period . 
As we heard repeatedly during the Congress , China &apos;s leadership reckons that its biggest policy challenge in the coming years will be the shift from export-led growth to an economic model based more firmly on domestic consumption . 
This has now become a matter of urgency , as the United States and Europe are unlikely to provide much support to Chinese exports . 
Indeed , China is now expected to undershoot its 10 % growth target for trade in 2012 , even though exports to emerging-market economies were up by more than that in the first nine months of the year . 
Income growth and a lower household savings rate are essential to the shift in China &apos;s growth model , and each presupposes key reforms . 
For example , improving the provision of health care , education , and care for the elderly , and bringing it into line with the needs and expectations of the emerging middle class should encourage more households to allocate a larger share of their income to consumption . 
Likewise , increasing the interest rates paid on bank deposits would enable savings to decline without loss of income . 
At the same time , as China proceeds along the path toward a market-based economy established more than 30 years ago by Deng Xiaoping , policymaking has become more complex . 
The economy needs to be steered in the desired direction without triggering instability , making correct sequencing and coordination of policy measures essential . 
As some Chinese colleagues told me , the success of reforms in the next decade will depend more than ever on good design . 
In particular , the new leadership will have to attend to the linkages between the real economy and the expanding financial sector as it overhauls state-owned companies and liberalizes the banks . 
From commodities to financial assets , price formation should become more market-based and transparent , while capital allocation should become more efficient and the scope for rent-seeking and corruption should be reduced . 
Moreover , as the renminbi &apos;s internationalization continues at a steady pace , domestic liberalization should occur in tandem with deeper global integration . 
In the coming years , the key issue , reflected in Hu &apos;s Congress-opening speech , will be the relationship between the state and the market . 
Many Chinese seem to believe that market discipline will bring fair competition and contribute to closing the widening gap between rich and poor . 
China &apos;s income distribution has become highly skewed : at 0.438 , the Gini coefficient , which measures income inequality , puts the country closer to the United States than to northern Europe &apos;s egalitarian societies ( with the exception of the United Kingdom ) . 
A key question for the next decade , therefore , is whether the Chinese authorities &quot; growth targets will be enough to preserve social cohesion as further economic and political reforms are gradually implemented . 
As the economic pie grows less rapidly , greater fairness will be crucial to social stability . 
Whether they will be able to engineer the necessary institutional shifts remains to be seen .
