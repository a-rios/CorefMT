A World of Trouble 
So you thought this year was bad ! 
2009 began with the flattening of Gaza . 
Unemployment is surging in many countries , even though we can detect the first signs of recovery from the recession . 
Many bankers , meanwhile , are back to the trough as though nothing had happened . 
Greed was just taking a temporary break . 
Pakistan is hit hard by a wave of monstrous Taleban attacks , and in Afghanistan NATO troops die and are terribly injured in large numbers . 
The &quot; Peace Process &quot; in the Middle East becomes ever more clearly the great oxymoron in international relations . 
Preparations for the climate change conference in Copenhagen are dominated by charges and recriminations . 
Even President Barack Obama , of whom miracles were expected , turns out to be no more than a very talented mortal . 
He receives the Nobel Peace Prize in the hope that maybe he can make next year better . 
He &apos;ll certainly have his work cut out . 
Will 2010 see a recovery shaped like a &quot; V &quot; or a &quot; W , &quot; or will there simply be an anemic tilt towards a very distant prospect of better times ? 
I suspect the latter , with unemployment and cuts in public spending - certainly in much of Europe and the United States - constraining economic confidence . 
That will make the politics of dealing with global imbalances all the more difficult . 
Let &apos;s be clear about what is happening . 
The deliberate undervaluation of China &apos;s currency , and the fall in the dollar , are both putting a squeeze on the export prospects of the European Union members and other countries like Canada and Mexico , and China &apos;s covert and not so covert export subsidies and import barriers exacerbate the problem . 
American exasperation has probably been curbed by its need to borrow so much money - much of it from China . 
But Obama &apos;s recent tariffs on tire imports may be a sign of things to come . 
Chinese behavior will put increasing political pressure on those of us in Europe and the US who are delighted about China &apos;s economic success and who argue for free trade . 
Weaker economies will also feel the pinch . 
I hope that China &apos;s sophisticated economic managers understand that either their country &apos;s behavior will have to change , or we are likely to face a massive trade conflict and disruption of global commerce . 
The patience even of free traders will wear thin in 2010 . 
Rows about the short-term costs of dealing with climate change won &apos;t make it any easier to keep markets open . 
But failure to act now will only raise the price of delayed action at some moment in the future . 
While the most hopeful outcome of the Copenhagen summit - a global pact limiting carbon emissions - has now been all but ruled out , the second-best outcome - negotiations on specific measures continue within a framework of general goodwill - would not be a disaster . 
Anything short of that would be very bad news . 
In either of these two more optimistic scenarios , one consequence will be the transfer - actual or putative - of considerable sums of money from developed to emerging or developing countries to cover some of their costs for emissions abatement and environmental protection . 
Now just imagine the problems that legislators in developed democracies will face when they must explain why billions of dollars and euros should be handed over to China , whose deliberately undervalued currency is costing their constituents their jobs . 
Obama &apos;s commitment to substantial nuclear disarmament bodes well for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Renewal Conference in 2010 . 
But , even with progress there , the problems created by the threat of nuclear weapons development in North Korea and Iran will remain . 
American and European diplomatic engagement with Iran is welcome . 
China and Russia seem unlikely to support any further sanctions against Iran if diplomacy fails . 
China &apos;s energy relationship with Iran grows ever stronger , and Russia continues to see its mission internationally as making trouble wherever it can . 
This is just a little of what 2010 perhaps has in store - and no mention yet of Israeli settlement building on the West Bank , Pakistan &apos;s struggle against murderous extremists , and NATO &apos;s bloody difficulties in propping up a discredited and corrupt Afghan regime in order to prevent the country from falling back into the hands of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda . 
Still , however gloomy the outlook , we do stagger on - the flowers still bloom , the breeze stirs the trees , the birds sing , and children laugh . 
The rest of us can enjoy life while Obama does the heavy lifting .
