Kuwait &apos;s Parliamentary Revolution 
The world has been transfixed by the victory of Hamas in the Palestinian election . 
Every sign indicates that the wave of democratization in Kuwait is irreversible , and the impact of these changes extends beyond Kuwait to all the other oil-rich Gulf countries , which are also ruled by emirs and sheikhs . 
Indeed , these rulers now have much to ponder . 
The death of Kuwait &apos;s ruler , Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah , on January 15 , 2006 , was followed by unprecedented national disquiet , which led to the rapid abdication of his designated successor , Saad Al Sabah . 
Nothing like this had ever hit the Al Sabah family , which has ruled Kuwait for two centuries . 
Traditionally , the role of ruling Emir alternated ( according to a tacit agreement ) between two rival branches of the Al Sabah family - the Al Jaber and the Al Salem . The succession was always strictly a family affair , and any disputes remained behind closed doors . 
However , with Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah &apos;s death , the succession was not only subjected to feverish public debate , but the Kuwaiti press and Parliament were key actors in determining the outcome . 
Kuwait &apos;s political system is considered the most modern among the Arab Gulf sheikhdoms and monarchies , because all citizens - men and women alike - elect its parliament . 
Elections with universal suffrage , combined with a relatively free press , meant that the succession became a public issue , debated in the media and by academics for months as Sheikh Jaber was dying . 
With the taboo on discussing the succession broken , talk about the physical and mental fitness of the likely successor became commonplace , and members of the ruling family who objected to the prospect of being ruled by a severely incapacitated crown prince came to enjoy broad support . 
Thus , immediately after Jaber al-Sabah &apos;s death , the succession became a national concern . 
What in the past would have been a straightforward palace coup spilled out onto the pages of newspapers and into the corridors of Parliament . 
The Crown Prince &apos;s abdication became inevitable . 
The cabinet of ministers affirmed the succession of Sabah al-Sabah as the new ruler , which was then ratified by Parliament . 
For the region , this was an historic moment . 
For the first time , an Arab parliament had voted a head of state out of office and asserted its will in choosing the successor . 
Parliamentary supremacy , one of the key issues in any country &apos;s democratization , appears to be at hand in Kuwait . 
Of course , Kuwait will now experience enormous tensions between the transparent rule of a true parliamentary government and the still powerful legacy of a hidden family-run state . 
But the old rule of force and intrigue by which other Gulf rulers have been deposed has been replaced by a modern principle - the Al Sabah have surrendered their exclusive control over the succession to the will of Parliament , which alone could provide the legitimacy that the new Emir needs . 
The consequences of this assertion of parliamentary authority will be enormous . Parliamentary ratification did not simply provide a rubber stamp to a palace coup ; its approval was conditional . 
Emirs who need parliamentary approval to secure popular legitimacy must now reckon with the need to share power . 
In exchange for voting to pass over the unfit Crown Prince , Kuwait &apos;s parliament is now demanding even more political and economic reforms , including the formal legalization of political parties , the separation of the position of prime minister from that of crown prince , and even for the prime minister to be chosen from outside the Al Sabah family . 
This was a true parliamentary revolution . 
According to Kuwait &apos;s constitution , the new ruler has one year to appoint a crown prince , but he has to appoint a prime minister immediately . 
The delay is significant , because Kuwaitis are unaccustomed to this kind of parliamentary influence . 
The new Emir will now need to navigate skillfully between the Al Sabah family &apos;s factions and a newly empowered parliament . 
The victory of Parliament in Kuwait &apos;s succession crisis is likely to lead some of Kuwait &apos;s neighboring autocracies to stiffen their resolve against modernity and democracy . 
The Kuwaiti model may be risky , but the alternative - simply ignoring the need for change - could prove fatal .
