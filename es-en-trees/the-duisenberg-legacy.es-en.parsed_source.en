The Duisenberg Legacy 
The European Central Bank &apos;s first president , Wim Duisenberg , is leaving office with his head held high . 
Under his leadership , Europe &apos;s first central bank has &quot; grown up , &quot; going from infancy to eminence in little more than a mere five years . 
The euro has been firmly established as a world-class currency . 
Inflation in the euro-zone economy hovers around 2 %  - more or less in line with the definition of price stability favored by the ECB . 
Inflationary expectations are stable , and the Governing Council runs smoothly . 
Not everyone in Europe is happy with an anti-inflation central bank . 
Critics who want a more activist , growth-oriented monetary policy have tried - albeit unsuccessfully - to soften up the 68-year-old Dutchman with personal attacks and degrading insults . 
The fledgling bank earned enormous credibility , but also considerable enmity , by sticking to its anti-inflation mandate . 
Of course , the ECB has had its problems - mainly in the communications area - and Duisenberg &apos;s candor sometimes did get him into trouble . 
Whatever problems may have existed in the early years - too many voices , too little clarity of message - were smoothed out over time . 
In a recent personal interview in his Frankfurt office , I asked Duisenberg what had been his single most important accomplishment in office . 
Without hesitation he responded that it was the smooth introduction and easy acceptance of the common currency . 
Now it can be told that the central bank had 25 to 30 disaster scenarios ready in case things went badly . 
None , in fact , was needed . 
The introduction of the euro currency was accomplished more smoothly than even the ECB had expected . 
But it was no single accomplishment that made Duisenberg &apos;s term in office a success . 
Rather , it was his consensual style of leadership . 
It would not have been possible with an authoritarian personality at the ECB helm . 
There is a myth now making the rounds that the search for consensus slowed down the ECB &apos;s decision-making process when setting monetary policy . 
According to Mr. Duisenberg , there was not a single instance when an important monetary policy decision was delayed because of the need for consensus . 
Notwithstanding the ECB &apos;s significant achievements during the Duisenberg years , important problems remain for the new president , Jean-Claude Trichet of France . 
The promise of the euro - that it would set off a competitive dynamic inside the euro-zone economy that would compel structural reform - has yet to be fulfilled . 
So far , Europe &apos;s politicians have resisted reform , and scarcely an opportunity went by that Wim Duisenberg didn &apos;t scold Europe &apos;s politicians for this failure . 
The Growth and Stability Pact ( which mandates a 3 % of GDP limit on the size of the budget deficits of euro-zone members ) is another contentious issue that awaits resolution . 
Controversy over the Pact has set off a nasty dispute between small and big countries in the euro-zone . 
There are well-founded complaints about double standards . 
The small countries follow the rules but the big countries act as if they are exempt . 
According to Nout Wellink , president of the Dutch Central Bank , failure to satisfactorily settle this issue could have serious negative consequences for the euro . 
Finally - and perhaps most important - is the problem of integrating the economies of the ten new member states into the euro area . 
This will not be easy . 
The bank must be careful not to bite off more than it can chew . 
Wim Duisenberg &apos;s appointment as first ECB president in May 1998 was mired in political controversy . 
He deserves Europe &apos;s unequivocal gratitude for launching the ECB so successfully .
