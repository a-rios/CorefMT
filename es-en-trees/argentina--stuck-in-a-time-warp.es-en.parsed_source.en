Argentina : Stuck in a Time Warp 
Argentina is stuck in a time warp . 
Political and economic reforms over the past decade were supposed to lead the country out of chronic economic crisis . 
In April 1991 Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo linked the Argentine Peso to America &apos;s dollar at a rate of one to one , kicking off an era of radical reform . 
Yet ten years later , the same Signor Cavallo is trying to fend off recession and government default . 
Argentina &apos;s cycle of crisis is perplexing . 
The past ten years saw industries and social security privatized and international trade liberalized . 
A chronic budget deficit was brought under control , infrastructure upgraded , and the banking sector strengthened . 
All this , and currency stabilization , made for an economic boom in Argentina that lasted until 1995 , as foreign investors poured money in . 
In that year , the economy was set back by Mexico &apos;s financial crisis . 
Growth rebounded strongly until 1998 . 
Since then , the economy has confronted prolonged recession , and the government is having trouble refinancing the public debt . 
Fears of a default abound . 
Starting with Cavallo , Argentina &apos;s boosters argue that these problems are transitory , and blame the country &apos;s difficulties on turmoil in world financial markets and the US dollar &apos;s excessive strength in relation to the Euro , which reduces Argentina &apos;s export competitiveness . 
Brazil &apos;s devaluation in 1999 also undermined export competitiveness . 
Low world commodities prices and protectionism against Argentina &apos;s agricultural exports are additional factors . 
These supporters also argue , with some justice , that Argentina &apos;s crisis results in part from a self- fulfilling prophesy among creditors . 
Since Argentina has been in crisis so often , investors always fear the worst and withdraw funds at the first hint of trouble , provoking an even deeper crisis . 
But something more than bad luck and self-fulfilling prophecies are at work . 
Argentina &apos;s Peso , because it is pegged to the US dollar , provides little flexibility . 
There is no safety valve in currency depreciation when the economy is buffeted by external shocks . 
Compare Argentina with another grain exporter , Australia , which has been hit by some of the same shocks . 
Australia &apos;s dollar depreciated from 78 US cents per Australian dollar in May 1997 to just 53 US cents per Australian dollar in May 2001 . 
This helped maintain Australia &apos;s exports and kept the economy growing at around 2 % per year , while Argentina &apos;s economy has been shrinking at around 2 % per year . 
But Argentina &apos;s woes go deeper . 
Argentina is vulnerable to external shocks such as declining agricultural commodity prices because Argentina failed to develop a diversified export sector , one in which a broad range of industrial and service sectors are internationally competitive . 
Argentina &apos;s trade is overwhelmingly concentrated in a small number of commodities , including cereals , meats , processed foods , and other agricultural products . 
Exports of machinery and transport equipment , embodying higher technology , claimed only 10 % or so of exports and only 1 % of GDP . 
In other words , Argentina has failed to become a technology-based economy . 
Market reformers focused their attention on reducing the size of government , but overlooked the government &apos;s role in raising the country &apos;s technological capacity . 
An economy &apos;s technological capacity depends on a wide range of social institutions . 
A well-functioning market system helps attract high-tech investors from abroad and fosters high-technology startups at home . 
But a high-tech economy also requires strong universities , with high enrolment , and large-scale government support for scientific research . 
America , for example , invests around $ 90 billion of public funds each year in scientific research . 
Some developing countries - Israel , Korea , and Taiwan - also invest heavily in higher education and scientific research . 
Sadly , Argentina did not . 
Under-investment in technology is evident throughout the economy . 
There are around 600 scientists for every million Argentines , compared with 2,200 scientists for every million Koreans . 
Argentina invests less than 1 % of its national income in research and development , compared with around 2.5 % of national income in Korea . 
Argentine inventors received just 63 patents in the US in the year 2000 , compared with 3,400 patents received by Korean inventors . 
The difference is reflected in economic growth . 
Argentina achieved per capita economic growth of just 0.5 % during 1980-1998 , while Korea grew at a rate of 6.2 % per year , fueled by its high-technology exports . 
Argentina &apos;s fate teaches a lot about development strategies . 
Argentina has much going for it : widespread literacy , a healthy population , a highly productive agricultural economy , and a strong natural resource base . 
Indeed , Argentina has had its share of economic success , with an income level , adjusted for purchasing power , around one-third of that of the US , and is far ahead of most countries in the world . 
But Argentina did not make a successful transformation from a resource-based to a technology-based economy . 
The reform prescriptions it followed helped end inflation but ignored the need for government to promote a knowledge-based economy . 
In the past countries could achieve high living standards by exploiting natural resources . 
In today &apos;s global economy , however , international competitive advantage is mostly based upon knowledge and the capacity to harness knowledge in new technologies . 
Countries need strategies to foster education and innovation just as they need strategies to preserve macroeconomic stability and a healthy business environment . 
The next stage of reforms in Argentina , and in countries in similar positions , should focus on fostering society &apos;s educational , scientific , and technological capacities .
