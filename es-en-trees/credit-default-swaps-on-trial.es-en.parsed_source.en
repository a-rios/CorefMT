Credit Default Swaps on Trial 
CHICAGO - The lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against Goldman Sachs for securities fraud , charging the bank with misrepresenting the way a collateralized debt obligations ( CDO ) had been formed , has revived public disgust at credit default swaps ( CDS ) , the instrument used to bet against these CDOs . 
Before the 2008 financial crisis , CDSs were an esoteric product , known only to a restricted number of sophisticated investors and specialized academics . 
Today , they are a household name , synonymous with unruly speculation , boundless greed , and , ultimately , systemic instability . 
Indeed , CDSs are blamed as one of the main causes of the financial crisis . 
The legality of Goldman Sachs &quot; behavior will be determined by a court of law , but CDSs &quot; odious reputation is jeopardizing the survival of this instrument in the court of public opinion . 
Riding the populist wave , several politicians have proposed a ban on CDSs . 
The recent Greek crisis has further galvanized the anti-CDS camp . 
After all , isn &apos;t it the fault of the CDS market &apos;s avaricious speculators that Greece was on the verge of default and that Greek public employees have had to endure deep wage cuts ? 
In a word , no . 
Far from being the spawn of the devil , CDSs are a useful financial instrument that can improve not only financial stability , but also the way that companies and countries are run . 
Banning them will do more harm than good . 
Any attempt in that direction is detrimental , because it would divert attention from the useful goal of disciplining the CDS market to make it more transparent , stable , and efficient . 
One key advantage ( if not the key advantage ) of capitalism over central planning is the information conveyed by market prices . 
When the demand for potatoes at the current price exceeds supply , the price of potatoes rises , signaling scarcity . 
Individual farmers do not need any bureaucratic directive to decide whether to plant more potatoes : an increase in prices creates an incentive to plant more potatoes ; a decrease in prices is a signal that they should plant less . 
The same is true with stock prices . 
An increase in the stock price of steel manufacturers suggests an increase in the demand for steel , which induces entrepreneurs to start more steel plants and investors to provide them with the money . 
Conversely , a decrease in the stock price of steel manufacturers leads entrepreneurs to liquidate existing plants and dissuades investors from committing more resources to the sector . 
Unfortunately , sometimes prices fail to perform this signaling function properly , as the dot-com and housing bubbles in recent years showed . 
During the dot-com bubble , prices signaled huge demand in the Internet sector . 
For this reason , hundreds of millions of dollars were wasted in advertising improbable companies on TV and building network capacity beyond any foreseeable need . 
During the housing bubble , prices signaled a severe scarcity of houses . 
So billions of dollars were poured into new developments in remote locations where nobody wants to live . 
Given the large misallocation of resources in such cases , it is vital to understand why prices failed to provide an accurate signal to investors . 
Why did the United States , with the most developed financial market in the world , experience two major bubbles in less than a decade ? 
An expansive monetary policy is partly to blame , but the real problem is an institutional setting that favors bullish sentiment . 
Pension funds , mutual funds , and investment banks are all long in the stock market . 
Shorting a stock is difficult and risky : it is difficult because borrowing stocks is hard to do , and it is risky because shorting has limited upside but infinite downside . 
In other words , the traditional securities available to investors make it easier to bet in favor of a company than against it , causing prices to be affected more by irrational exuberance than by panics . 
In this respect , CDSs are unique . 
Because they function as insurance on borrowers &quot; ability to meet their obligations , they make it easier to express a negative opinion on a company or a security . 
To express a negative view via the CDS market , investors do not need to locate securities to borrow ( a prerequisite to shorting ) , and they risk only a limited premium , while they have the opportunity to gain many times that . 
It was the CDS market that allowed the negative - and correct - view of the housing market held by John Paulson and others finally to be embedded into market prices . 
They made the bubble burst . 
While painful for the rest of society , this is healthy . 
The longer a bubble lasts , the more damage it causes . 
The same reasoning applies to the Greek crisis . 
The CDSs on Greece provide a useful signal of the country &apos;s compromised financial situation . 
It is thanks to the spike in the CDS market that the Greek government tightened its budget and improved its fiscal position . 
Medical tests , too , often bring bad news , but abolishing medical testing does not solve problems , it only hides them , making them worse . 
The reason that politicians and corporate managers alike hate CDSs is precisely because CDS rates are so useful and so prompt in exposing their mistakes . 
Nobody likes to be found wrong . 
For this reason , politicians and powerful businessmen often cajole the press , the credit rating agencies , and even the analysts to portray their actions in a positive light . 
As the main source of negative information that is not sensitive to power , the CDS market is feared , and politicians want to eliminate it . 
Of course , the CDS market is not perfect . 
In fact , it is not really an organized market , but only an informal virtual exchange . 
The existing rules are designed not to make it transparent or resilient , but to make it more profitable for large institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan . 
So intervention is needed to formalize the CDS market and force appropriate collateralization , so that no government has to step in to rescue any counterparty . 
But regulating the CDS market does not mean banning it . 
To do so would only sow the seeds of the next bubble .
