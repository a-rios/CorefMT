Who Beats Corruption ? 
Corruption undermines the quality of life for people around the world , not only in poor countries . 
The US currently is witnessing several corruption scandals . 
Even America &apos;s Federal Emergency Management Agency , responsible for providing relief after natural disasters and man-made catastrophes , was in the hands of inept political cronies rather than professionals . 
When hurricane Katrina struck America &apos;s Gulf Coast , that incompetence proved fatal . 
All societies require an effective government that can provide vital and irreplaceable public services and infrastructure . 
Thus , governments are invested with unique powers , especially the powers of policing and judicial control . 
But these powers are also readily abused . 
How , then , to ensure that governments are law-abiding as well as strong ? 
The best answer , both in theory and practice , is to find ways to hold governments accountable to the people that they serve . 
Elections are obviously one method , though campaign financing can be a source of corruption . 
Politicians around the world trade favors for cash needed to win elections , and they often use that cash to buy the votes of desperately poor people . 
Clear electoral rules and procedures can help ensure transparency , but accountability also comes from the broad society in between elections . 
Privately owned newspapers , independent radio and television networks , trade unions , churches , professional societies , and other groups within civil society provide a bulwark against despotism . 
In the poorest countries , where illiteracy is high , desperate people are subject to government manipulation , and there is a lack of independent control through the media and professional organizations , governments face only weak control by society . 
They tend to be the most despotic and corrupt , not because poor people care less about good governance - on the contrary , their very lives depend on it - but because they lack the means to keep their government disciplined and law abiding . 
The result is a trap in which poverty causes bad governance and bad governance causes poverty - a two-way spiral downward that can lead to such extreme deprivation that the government , lacking computers , telephones , information systems , and trained civil servants , couldn &apos;t function honestly even if it wanted to . 
The end result can be collapse into a kind of anarchy , as in Liberia , Sierra Leone , and Somalia . 
One measure of the quality of governance in over 150 countries is provided by Transparency International , an organization dedicated to strengthening civil society in the fight against government corruption . 
Transparency International produces an annual ranking of &quot; corruption perceptions , &quot; measuring the public &apos;s view of the extent of corruption in a country . 
In the 2005 rankings , Iceland scored as the least corrupt country , with the Scandinavian countries , New Zealand , and Singapore close behind . 
The US ranked seventeenth from the top , a not-so-glorious position for the world &apos;s leading power . 
In general , the poorer the country , the lower the ranking : tied for last place are Chad and Bangladesh . 
A bit of statistical analysis reveals further important patterns . 
First , Sub-Saharan African countries are less corrupt on average than countries at the same income level in other parts of the world . 
For example , Burkina Faso , Ghana , Mali , and Rwanda rank much higher than Bangladesh , Indonesia , Pakistan , and Vietnam . 
Yet the Asian countries &quot; economies have tended to grow much faster over the past generation . 
Corruption therefore cannot be the unique factor that holds Africa back . 
Africa &apos;s problems have more to do with droughts , malaria , AIDS , and lack of infrastructure . 
Poor countries achieve lower levels of corruption when civil rights are protected . 
When people have the freedom to assemble , to speak , and to publish their views , society benefits not only by increasing the range of ideas that are debated , but also by keeping corruption in check . 
It is no surprise that corrupt regimes routinely clamp down on the press , trade unions , and on professional associations . 
In Africa , less corrupt countries like Ghana also have much better protection of civil liberties than more corruption-prone countries like Chad and Ethiopia , which are also even poorer . 
Finally , the data show that corruption is highest in oil and gas-producing countries . 
In general , natural resources like oil , gas , diamonds , and other precious minerals breed corruption , because governments can live off of their export earnings without having to &quot; compromise &quot; with their own societies . 
The natural resources are therefore not only a target of corruption but also an instrument of holding power . 
Many foreign companies , intent on cashing in , fuel the pathology of corrupt regimes by peddling in bribes and political protection . 
The implications for action are clear . 
By strengthening civil society - through legal rights and long-term economic development - and instituting clear rules to ensure accountability , political despotism and corruption will be brought under control . 
We should be uncompromising , therefore , in our defense of civil liberties . 
The rich world should offer impoverished regions like sub-Saharan Africa more economic support to break out of poverty . 
By raising living standards , we would also be empowering both civil society and impoverished governments to defend the rule of law .
