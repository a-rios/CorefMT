Spooked by Glass-Steagall &apos;s Ghost ? 
CAMBRIDGE - America &apos;s long-controversial Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 , which separated deposit-taking commercial banks from securities-trading investment banks in the United States , is back in the news . 
This separation long symbolized America &apos;s unusual history of bank regulation - probably the most unusual in the developed world . 
American banking regulation had long kept US banks small and local ( unable to branch across state lines ) , unlike their European and Japanese equivalents , while limiting their operational capacity ( by barring banks from mixing commercial and investment banking ) . 
These limits on American banking persisted until the 1990 &quot; s , when Congress repealed most of this regulatory structure . 
Now the idea of a new Glass-Steagall is back , and not only in the US . 
Sandy Weill , Citigroup &apos;s onetime CEO , said last month that allowing commercial and investment banks to merge was a mistake . 
This is the same Weill who had lobbied to gut Glass-Steagall in order to build today &apos;s Citigroup , which put insurance companies , securities dealers , and traditional deposit-taking banks all under one roof . 
In fact , he engineered an agreement to merge Citi with a large insurer - illegal at the time under Glass-Steagall - and then pushed for the law &apos;s repeal , so that the merger could proceed . 
A similar debate has been underway in Britain . 
A commission headed by Sir John Vickers , the Oxford economist and former Bank of England chief economist , wants banks &quot; retail operations to be &quot; ring-fenced &quot; from riskier trading and investment banking businesses . 
Ring-fencing is not exactly Glass-Steagall-style separation - Glass-Steagall forbade commercial banks from even affiliating with investment banks - but it is in the same spirit . 
The impetus for the rethinking is , of course , the recent financial crisis . 
Are Weill and Vickers right now , people are asking , or was Weill right two decades ago , when he backed allowing investment and commercial banks to merge ? 
That is actually the wrong question to ask first . 
The first question is whether Glass-Steagall &apos;s repeal strongly contributed to the financial crisis in the US . 
If it did , Glass-Steagall &apos;s repeal should be revisited , and quickly . 
If it did not contribute much to the crisis , keeping risky trading away from commercial banks &quot; deposit base may still be desirable , but not something that the financial crisis &quot; proved &quot; is necessary . 
Those who say that the financial recent crisis tells us to re-enact Glass-Steagall overlook what failed and what did not : the largest failures in the 2008 crisis - Lehman Brothers , AIG , and the Reserve Primary Fund - were not deposit-taking commercial banks on which Glass-Steagall &apos;s repeal had a major impact . 
AIG was a mega-insurer . 
Lehman was an investment bank . 
The Reserve Primary Fund - brought down by its purchases of IOU &apos;s from Lehman - was a money-market mutual fund , not a commercial bank . 
True , major commercial banks , like Citibank and Bank of America , tottered , but they were not at risk because of their securities underwriting for corporate clients or their securities-trading divisions , but because of how they ( mis ) handled mortgage securities . 
Mortgage lending , however , is a long-standing activity for commercial and savings banks , mostly unaffected by Glass-Steagall or its repeal . 
Some commercial-banking activities are closer to securities trading . 
The so-called &quot; Volcker Rule , &quot; proposed by Paul Volcker , the former US Federal Reserve chairman , is a mini-Glass-Steagall , aiming to bar deposit-taking commercial banks from derivatives trading - now seen to be a dangerous activity for them . 
But , again , although derivatives trading played an important role in the crisis ( AIG &apos;s inability , without a government bailout , to honor its risky credit-default swaps is the best example ) , Glass-Steagall &apos;s repeal did not unleash the riskiest trades in the institutions that failed . 
Reenacting it will do little , if anything , to remedy crisis-related ills , beyond what the Volcker Rule is supposed to do anyway . 
The best case against Glass-Steagall &apos;s repeal is not that mixing investment and commercial banking caused the crisis . 
Rather , the best case arises from a general sense that financial institutions have become too complicated to regulate and too big to fail even when staying within their traditional businesses . 
Hence , we should simplify and strengthen them . 
But even if those are the goals , the recent focus on repealing Glass-Steagall is not helpful , because it is not the most important way to simplify and strengthen America &apos;s banks . 
It thereby diverts policymakers &quot; attention from the main issues . 
If the financial crisis reveals a structural problem in banking , it is more likely to come from insufficient capital to cushion a bank &apos;s fall , or from too many financial institutions having become too big to fail . 
The US Dodd-Frank legislation , enacted in 2010 , did ( weakly ) cap the size of future bank mergers . 
But , if size is still the problem , more could be done . 
If big banks have become too complex to regulate , then a workable Volcker Rule is the best way to start simplifying them . 
And , if the problem is systemically risky derivatives trading in banks and elsewhere , then the priority given to derivatives traders over nearly every creditor ought to be curtailed . 
Ironically , Glass-Steagall itself arose in the 1930 &quot; s from commercial bankers &quot; efforts to divert regulators &quot; attention from other remedies . 
Small-town bankers throughout the country wanted government-guaranteed deposit insurance , while stronger big-city banks feared that government deposit insurance would put them at a competitive disadvantage . 
After all , deposits from the small-town banks were running off to big banks in money centers like New York , Chicago , and Los Angeles . 
Two decades ago , Donald Langevoort , now a law professor at Georgetown , showed that major bankers - indeed , the leaders of First National City , the predecessor to Weill &apos;s Citibank - proposed Glass-Steagall in lieu of deposit insurance . 
No big bank was at risk from trading securities then , but the big banks &quot; investment-banking affiliates were not making money trading and underwriting securities during the Depression , so the banks were willing to surrender that part of their business . 
The irony is that Congress took up the big banks &quot; offer to separate commercial and investment banking , but then enacted deposit insurance anyway . 
Glass-Steagall was a distraction then ; it is a distraction now . 
If the goal is to shore up the weaknesses revealed by the global financial crisis , policymakers in the US and other countries should first look elsewhere .
