China &apos;s Financial Fetish 
With the drum beating for the development of the costal areas of Tianjin near Beijing , the curtain seems to be rising on yet another &quot; financial center &quot; in China . 
When Shanghai sought a similar role several years ago , bankers and investors around the world wondered whether the aim was really for Shanghai to replace Hong Kong as China &apos;s financial heart . 
In the current pilot project , Tianjin in China &apos;s north and Shanghai in the south are competing against each other , prompting even more second-guessing . 
Once upon a time , no one had any idea about how to create a &quot; financial center . &quot; 
A financial center was simply a great metropolis where enormous financial dealings took place . 
Cities such as London and New York became known as financial centers only after they had proved themselves in the role . 
Policymakers in China seem to be unaware that many major cities have not had the luck to become financial centers . 
There is no economic or other theory that explains why a city called a &quot; financial center &quot; should be more valuable or lovely than others . 
Why , then , should China make developing global financial centers a vital national goal ? 
Does China really need its own financial centers of world standing ? 
Does the world need China to have them ? 
Or is such a goal necessary because a financial center can determine the fate of a great metropolis ? 
Nothing in the history of finance , the evolution of cities , or modern economics provides a clear answer . 
It is the Chinese who have endowed the term &quot; financial center &quot; with such weight and meaning by trying to dissect the functions of such cities and quantify every detail . 
As a result , politicians are prepared to pick a city and order it to create the functions of a financial center , as if such a thing can be constructed like a building - a concept that could not be more off the mark . 
Indeed , according to modern development models of finance , whether or not a physical center of finance exists is no longer a meaningful issue . 
Owing to historical factors and opportunities , financial transactions were concentrated in cities that were traditionally closely linked to the rise of European and American capitalism . 
But what counts nowadays is not where financial transactions physically take place , but rather the growing importance and globalization of finance in the operation of the world economy . 
Cities do not become financial centers because they are more &quot; excellent &quot; than other cities , or because they have done something that other cities failed to do . 
Instead , once financial transactions begin to concentrate in a place , it becomes hard to move them to other places . 
A free-market economy and its legal traditions  -  both indispensable to the survival of financial centers - certainly helps them to rise , but that initial rise has always been attributable to historical evolution , not government strategy . 
In this sense , China &apos;s effort to deliberately create , through government fiat , global financial centers is both exacting and dogmatic . 
There is no doubt that China needs its financial sector to develop soundly in order to ensure sustained economic growth . 
And there is now a common understanding in China that meeting this objective requires that the government safeguard financial liberalization . 
But progress has been slow , because China &apos;s politicians have put nurturing financial centers - which should be the objective of local governments - at the heart of the country &apos;s financial development . 
Indeed , equating financial liberalization with privileges for cities designated as &quot; financial centers &quot; undermines the very goals of liberalization - namely , to reduce government control and to accelerate the development of financial markets . 
China &apos;s financial system is failing in that respect , owing to frequent administrative and political intervention . 
As a result , Shanghai has been restricted from making the best of its financial functions , and Hong Kong , Asia &apos;s acknowledged financial center , from assisting China &apos;s financial modernization . 
What China needs most is a financial sector capable of harnessing the forces of liberalization and globalization to drive economic growth in the decades ahead . 
The time has come to cast off the burden of building financial centers , and focus instead on advancing the modernization of Chinese finance .
