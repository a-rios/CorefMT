Life-Saving Drugs for All 
PRINCETON - The deadly outbreak of Ebola in Liberia , Sierra Leone , and Guinea that began last year highlighted a problem in the production of pharmaceuticals . 
Once it became clear that the epidemic would not be rapidly contained , several firms quickly arranged for clinical trials of potential treatments and vaccines , indicating that they already had the ability to produce plausible candidates . 
Ebola is not a new disease : it was first identified in 1976 . 
Prior to 2014 , however , the largest outbreak was in Uganda , in 2000 , when 425 people were infected and 224 died . 
Though Ebola was known to be both contagious and often fatal , it was thought that only Africa &apos;s impoverished rural population was at risk . 
For pharmaceutical firms , the development of a vaccine or treatment was not commercially attractive , and so it did not warrant investment . 
All that changed with the latest outbreak . 
In September 2014 , the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicted that , in the worst case , 1.4 million people could be infected within four months . 
Media-fed fears that the disease could spread to affluent countries led to extraordinary precautions . 
In the United States , President Barack Obama asked Congress for $ 6.2 billion , including $ 2.4 billion to reduce the risk of the disease becoming established in America and set up 50 US Ebola treatment centers . 
The worst-case scenario did not materialize . 
As of April 2015 , the best estimate is that about 25,000 people have been infected , with approximately 10,000 deaths . 
Outside West Africa , there have been fewer than 30 cases , and only five deaths . 
Nevertheless , the fears , and especially the prospect of a new and lucrative market , set pharmaceutical firms scrambling to develop Ebola-related products , while health officials lamented that nothing had been done beforehand . 
I am not criticizing pharmaceutical companies for not producing an Ebola vaccine when there was no market for it . 
They are not charities . 
If we want them to make products that will help the poor in developing countries , we need to find ways of giving them - and their shareholders - a return on their investment . 
Whereas pharmaceutical companies lack incentives to aid the poor in developing countries , they have strong incentives to develop products for people in affluent countries . 
One drug , Soliris , costs $ 440,000 per patient per year . 
In contrast , GiveWell estimates that the cost of saving a life by distributing bed nets in regions where malaria is a major killer is $ 3,400 . 
Given that most of the lives saved are those of children , who even in developing countries have a life expectancy of at least 50 years , this equates to a cost of $ 68 per year of life saved . 
Should we really be valuing the life of a person in an affluent country at more than 6,000 times the value of the life of an impoverished child in a developing country ? 
Because the overwhelming majority of medical and pharmaceutical research is directed toward products that affect people in affluent countries , it targets only part of the global burden of disease . 
Some government- and foundation-funded research addresses diseases that primarily affect poor people , but these efforts are not systematic and do not use the incentives that work well to drive pharmaceutical innovation elsewhere . 
One promising attempt to correct this imbalance is the proposal for a Health Impact Fund that Thomas Pogge , director of the Global Justice Program at Yale , and Aidan Hollis , an economist at the University of Calgary , launched seven years ago . 
If the Health Impact Fund could be adequately financed , it would provide incentives to develop products in proportion to their impact in reducing the global burden of disease . 
It is not certain that the existence of such a fund prior to the recent Ebola outbreak would have led to the development of vaccines or treatments for the disease . 
But pharmaceutical companies would have been considering such products - as well as other treatments to save lives or improve health anywhere in the world , regardless of people &apos;s ability to pay . 
Pogge and Hollis have now refined their proposal to the point that it is ready for a real-world trial . 
A company that develops a product would earn a share of reward money based on its share of the health improvements achieved by all the products competing for the available funds . 
What is still needed , however , is sufficient reward money - perhaps $ 100 million from governments , NGOs , foundations and the pharmaceutical industry - to stimulate serious investment . 
Such a pilot program would benefit poor patients and would test scientists &quot; ability to measure health impact fairly and accurately . 
It would also provide the evidence needed to go to governments , foundations , and global institutions for the much larger sums required to expand the present system of incentives that guide pharmaceutical companies &quot; decisions . 
If the pilot is successful , we will have found a way to support the development of drugs and vaccines that gives equal weight to protecting the lives and improving the health of all human beings , irrespective of their nationality or wealth .
