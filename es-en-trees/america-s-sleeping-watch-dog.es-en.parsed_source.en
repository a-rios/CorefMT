America &apos;s Sleeping Watch Dog 
I want to deviate from my usual economic theme this month and focus instead on the system by which the press - mostly the American press - covers government nowadays . 
But perhaps this is not too great a deviation , for the behavior of the press affects not only politics , but economics as well . 
Consider an editorial written in March by the Washington Post &apos;s editorial director , Fred Hiatt , in which he makes a very small and limited apology for the newspaper &apos;s coverage and evaluation of the Bush administration . 
According to Hiatt , &quot; We raised such issues &quot; as whether the Bush administration had properly thought its proposed adventure in Iraq through , &quot; but with insufficient force . &quot; 
In other words , Hiatt finds fault with himself and his organization for saying the right thing , but not loudly enough . 
Next , consider a comment by the former editor of the New York Times , Max Frankel , about how the Washington ecology of media leaks is healthy , because &quot; most reporters do not just lazily regurgitate ... leaks . &quot; 
Instead , &quot; they use them as wedges to pry out other secrets &quot; and so oversee the government . 
The system may be &quot; sloppy and breed confusion , &quot; but &quot; tolerating abusive leaks by government &#91; that misinform &#93; is the price that society has to pay for the benefit of receiving essential leaks about government . &quot; 
So , where Hiatt sees a press corps that was a little too cowardly about overseeing the Bush administration , Frankel sees a press corps where a sloppy and confusing process is nevertheless doing a reasonable job . 
I see a very different picture . 
It was the summer of 2000 when I began asking Republicans I know - generally people who might be natural candidates for various sub-cabinet policy positions in a Republican administration - how worried they were that the Republican presidential candidate , George W. Bush , was clearly not up to the job . 
They were not worried , they told me , that Bush was inadequately briefed and strangely incurious for a man who sought the most powerful office in the world . 
One of President Clinton &apos;s problems , they said , was that the ceremonial portions of the job bored him - and thus he got himself into big trouble . 
Look at how Bush had operated as president of the Texas Rangers baseball club , they said . 
Bush let the managers manage the team and the financial guys run the business . 
He spent his time making sure the political coalition to support the Texas Rangers in the style to which it wanted to be accustomed remained stable . 
Bush knows his strengths and weaknesses , they told me . 
He will focus on being America &apos;s Queen Elizabeth II , and will let people like Colin Powell and Paul O &apos;Neill be America &apos;s Tony Blair and Gordon Brown . 
By the summer of 2001 , it had become clear that something had gone very wrong . 
By that point , Bush had rejected O &apos;Neill &apos;s and Christine Todd Whitman &apos;s advice on environmental policy , just as he had rejected Alan Greenspan &apos;s and O &apos;Neill &apos;s advice on fiscal policy , Powell &apos;s and Condoleezza Rice &apos;s advice on the importance of pushing forward on negotiations between Israel and Palestine , and - as we learned later - George Tenet &apos;s and Richard Clarke &apos;s advice about the importance of counterterrorism . 
A strange picture of Bush emerged from conversations with sub-cabinet administration appointees , their friends , and their friends of friends . 
He was not just under-briefed , but also lazy : he insisted on remaining under-briefed . 
He was not just incurious , but also arrogant : he insisted on making uninformed decisions , and hence made decisions that were essentially random . 
And he was stubborn : once he had made a decision - even , or rather especially , if it was glaringly wrong and stupid - he would never revisit it . 
So , by the summer of 2001 , a pattern was set that would lead British observer Daniel Davies to ask if there was a Bush administration policy on anything of even moderate importance that had not been completely bollixed up . 
But if you relied on either the Washington Post or the New York Times , you would have had a very hard time seeing it . 
Today , it is an accepted fact that the kindest thing you can say about the Bush administration is that it is completely incompetent , which is the line now taken by hard-line Bush supporters like the National Review and the commentator Robert Novak . 
Why didn &apos;t the American press corps cover the Bush administration properly for its first five years ? 
I really do not know . 
I do know that the world cannot afford to rely again on America &apos;s press for its information : fool me once , shame on you ; fool me twice , shame on me . 
So I appeal to all of you working for newspapers , radio , and television stations outside the United States : it is to you that we - including those of us in America - must look to discover what our own government is doing .
