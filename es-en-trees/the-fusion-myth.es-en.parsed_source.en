The Fusion Myth 
France is now rushing to construct the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor , ( ITER ) , which is supposed to show that nuclear fusion can be used to power nuclear power stations . 
ITER is often presented as the long-term solution to the problem of global warming , because nuclear fusion can provide an infinite and clean source of energy . 
But ITER will do nothing of the sort . 
In the fission reactions that nuclear power generation relies on today , heavy elements such as uranium break into smaller ones , while in nuclear fusion small elements such as hydrogen stick together and form heavier elements ( helium ) . 
Both fission and fusion produce a lot of energy . 
Some political leaders explain that nuclear fusion is at work in the sun , and that , thanks to ITER , we will harness it . 
They often add that , since fusion burns hydrogen , which can be found in seawater , it is an infinite source of energy . 
Unfortunately , political leaders know little about the scientific issues involved . 
That nuclear fusion is a source of energy has been known since the invention of the hydrogen bomb . 
But its control is still a fundamental challenge for research institutes , not some minor technical difficulty that can be easily overcome . 
Confining a little sun inside a box is an extremely difficult task for three main reasons . 
First , the nuclear fuel is not seawater , but a mixture of the two heavy isotopes of hydrogen , deuterium and tritium , a radioactive element that has been produced in small quantities for hydrogen bombs . 
Any development of fusion reactors would require producing tritium with industrial methods that have yet to be invented . 
Second , the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction starts at around 100 million degrees . 
To achieve this requires using a magnet to accelerate a plasma that is a big flame of deuterium and tritium nuclei . 
This must be done in a ultra-high vacuum in a large chamber . 
ITER is not designed to produce electricity , but to study the stability of the flame in the magnet . 
Since the fusion reactions produce alpha particles , which pollute the plasma , one has to insert a &quot; divertor &quot; inside the flame at 100 million degrees in order to clean it . 
Nobody has ever accomplished this , but ITER may be able to try around 2030 - that is , if it solves the previous problem . 
Third , fusion also emits neutrons that will produce helium gas bubbles inside the wall material , which tends to explode . 
The supporters of ITER explain that if the walls are porous , the bubbles can escape . 
But nothing can be both leak-proof and porous , and ITER is not designed to study this contradiction . 
In the future , a &quot; blanket &quot; should be inserted between the plasma and the walls , with two objectives : to protect the outer walls and to produce tritium from nuclear reactions within a circulating fluid containing lithium . 
This might work , but the first wall of the blanket will need to be not only leak-proof and porous , but also sufficiently permeable to neutrons , which have to hit the lithium atoms beyond it . 
The problem of materials is an entire research field in itself . 
In order to study it , it has been decided to build the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility ( IFMIF ) in Japan . 
Some scientists have argued that the neutron irradiation in IFMIF won &apos;t be the same as in fusion reactors , but it should be noted that its cost , at one billion euros , will be one-tenth that of ITER . 
So why can &apos;t we wait for IFMIF &apos;s results before building ITER ? 
It all depends on one &apos;s budget . 
If ITER could really solve the planet &apos;s energy problem , € 10 billion would be a negligible investment - less than the net profit of the oil company TOTAL ( € 13 billion in 2006 ) and equivalent to ten days of waging the war in Iraq . 
But if fusion is ever to work in industrial power stations , it will take many decades . 
Even if ITER is successful , and if one solves the tritium and material problems , everything would need to be tested in real size , and only then could a first prototype of an industrial reactor be built . 
A drastic reduction of CO2 emissions is an urgent priority , but fusion is unlikely to produce sufficient energy to achieve that goal before the twenty-second century . 
In fact , ITER is a big instrument for fundamental research , so its € 500 million Euros annual cost needs to be compared with similar scientific initiatives , such as the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) , which costs one billion Swiss francs per year . 
In my opinion , searching for the fundamental structure of particles is far more important than studying the stability of a plasma . 
In France , the contribution to ITER is more than all the available funding for research projects in all our physics laboratories . 
So the danger is that ITER will squeeze out funding for other vital research . 
We already have the bad example of the International Space Station , a waste of $ 100 billion that has produced no scientific results . 
ITER will not solve our energy problem . 
Although it has some scientific interest in plasma physics , the participating countries should clearly state that funding it won &apos;t affect the rest of their research efforts . 
At the same time , the international community should support research on energy saving and storage , and accelerate the development of fourth-generation nuclear reactors , which will use fission and be both clean and durable .
