Home Sweet Second Home 
Whenever I speak at finance and economics conferences around the world , I find that a great conversation starter with the spouses of the middle-aged business people who attend is to inquire about their vacation home . 
I then find myself entertained by stories of gorgeous ocean sunsets seen from the porch , views onto expanses of colorful wildflowers on mountainsides , and happy family reunions in beautiful seclusion ( as well as problems with the plumbing ) . 
Years ago , I never asked about vacation homes . 
They never seemed so much on people &apos;s minds . 
Purchases of second homes for pleasure were confined to the rich , and thus did not seem quite so much of a conversation topic for the rank-and-file business people that I meet at such conferences . 
But now the world is undergoing a second-home boom : an increasing number of people are buying vacation homes in beautiful and fun places that are within a few hours &quot; flying time from their first homes and jobs . 
Their second homes are a retreat where they will spend only a fraction of the year , and recently pristine mountain ridges and ocean cliffs are being dotted with new homes to meet the demand . 
A study by the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) indicates that 13 % of all homes purchased in the United States in 2004 were vacation homes . 
This does not include buyers who purchased homes as investment properties , mostly to rent out . 
According to the NAR , investment buyers account for another 23 % of home sales , bringing second-home purchases to 36 % of the total . 
Some of the US counties with a high proportion of vacation homes are seeing price increases that rival , if not outstrip , the booming metropolitan areas . 
For example , according to the Case-Shiller Indexes , home prices in the fashionable Cape Cod vacation area in Massachusetts soared 184 % from 1997 to 2005 , compared to the 131 % increase in nearby Boston over the same period . 
America is not alone . 
Europeans are buying gem√ºtliche Alpine ski chalets , glamorous condominiums with Mediterranean views in the South of Spain , and , increasingly , villas in picturesque sites in Turkey , Hungary , and Croatia . 
Australians are buying oceanfront properties at the Sunshine Coast and the Whitsundays . 
Japan &apos;s vacation-home boom of the 1980 &quot; s has largely fizzled with its collapsing stock market and urban land market . 
But even there , the market for vacation homes remains hot in places like Karuizawa , Lake Kawaguchi , and Hakone . 
Being able to afford a vacation home in beautiful surroundings may mean a lot to some people . 
Indeed , sometimes the talk that I hear about these properties seems to integrate them into the true meaning of life . After all , where do we imagine that philosophers and poets and gurus live ? 
In one of these captivatingly charming places , of course , and not as tourists in hotel rooms . 
Most people who couldn &apos;t possibly afford such a vacation home probably don &apos;t miss it . 
Craving one seems to be a desire , like fine wine , that one discovers only when one has substantial wealth . 
So , as global economic growth continues , and as household incomes rise in today &apos;s most populous emerging countries , demand - and thus prices - for vacation homes in beautiful places , either at home or abroad , will most likely soar . 
There is reason to worry about this . 
Real GDP has been growing at around 3 % a year in many advanced countries , and twice that or more in some emerging countries . 
Properties in beautiful places are likely to be what economists call &quot; superior goods &quot; - those goods that account for a higher proportion of consumption as incomes rise . 
With fixed supply , rents on these properties should increase at a rate equal to or above the rate of GDP growth . 
Prices could increase much faster at times . 
On the other hand , in some places , a speculative bubble is fueling today &apos;s boom in vacation-home prices . 
The vacation-home boom appears psychologically tied to the urban home-price bubble in many of the world &apos;s &quot; glamour cities , &quot; and prices of these vacation homes are similarly vulnerable to a significant drop in coming years . 
Moreover , there are plenty of ways for the construction industry to offer untold millions more people the opportunity to call some beautiful place home , simply by building more high-density and high-rise vacation apartment buildings there . 
Many of the single-family vacation mansions or low-density apartment buildings that are being built today will likely eventually be sold , torn down , and replaced with higher-density megastructures , boosting supply and thus easing pressure on prices of the remaining low-density vacation homes . 
Such higher-density construction must be the best possible outcome , for it will please the most people . 
Most vacationers seem to derive a sense of excitement from the presence of many other vacationers around them . 
Large numbers of people contribute to a holiday atmosphere and attract entertainment and sports industries . 
But , for many of those who imagine relaxing in a place that offers a quaint life of undisturbed beauty , there is a strong risk that prices will rise out of reach in future decades . 
No economic strategy can change that , even if it produces spectacular GDP growth .
