Creative Europe 
LJUBLJANA - At the Spring European Council meeting on March 13-14 , EU member states &quot; leaders will launch the second cycle of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs , a strategy launched in 2000 with the aim of making the EU the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world . 
The EU &apos;s current economic upturn suggests that the strategy is working , particularly after its renewal in 2005 . 
But some areas in which Europe could gain a competitive advantage have been neglected . 
One such area is creativity . 
The Lisbon Strategy owes much to the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter , who claimed that profit results from innovation . 
This is an appropriate European compromise between the theory that profit comes from exploitation ( Marx ) and the view that it results from transactions that make both parties happier than they were before ( Friedman ) . 
It is also appropriate for an economy where goods and services fulfill people &apos;s needs and where products compete on their technical or functional features . 
But in post-industrial societies , consumers look for more in a product than just functionality . 
Relatively prosperous Europeans tend not to purchase a car merely to get from point A to point B , shoes to keep their feet dry , a watch just to tell the time , or a bottle of water only to quench their thirst . 
We buy things that mean something more to us than what we use them for . 
The intangible characteristics that make a product more than simply useful are what differentiate expensive products from cheap products , and include design , brand name , and environmental friendliness . 
We may also be willing to pay more for products that are manufactured at home , in a safe workplace , without child labor , etc . 
Companies apparently recognize this . 
According to the popular business writer Daniel Pink , giving meaning or sense to a product or a service is increasingly becoming the main source of added value . 
This is all the more true as Asian universities turn out vast numbers of engineers and other knowledge workers who are just as qualified as their European colleagues , and as brilliant in technical design as they are in optimizing the manufacturing process . 
Adding value in this non-functional sense is a quintessentially European strength . 
It is at least as much an art as it is a science , and it goes beyond technical and business innovation . 
World-class design and brands already have a foothold in Europe , where creative industries are stronger that the car industry . 
There are good reasons for that . 
Europe gave the world Hippocrates , da Vinci , Voltaire , Beethoven , Florence Nightingale , Dostoyevski , Nobel , John Lennon , and many others who have shaped world culture . 
Today , Europe is defending the moral high ground when it comes to values such as human rights , peaceful conflict resolution , social welfare , and care for the environment . 
Far from being actual or potential obstacles to material success , it is precisely such values that should be celebrated and actively projected into Europe &apos;s economy . 
Embedding Europe &apos;s cultural and ethical background in goods and services that reflect these values would not only set the European economy apart from the rest of the world , but would also strengthen these values globally . 
Perhaps the most urgent example is Europe &apos;s moral leadership on climate change , which , supported through policies such as the Lisbon Strategy , should be translated into technical leadership and early entry into lucrative markets for low-carbon products . 
The &quot; soft power &quot; of goods and services reflects the cultural environment that creative individuals require for their work and growth . 
In addition , such goods and services require properly cultivated consumers . 
As the urban studies theorist Richard Florida has argued , it is technology and tolerance that attract talents . 
Europe should therefore become a magnet for creative people from all over the world and should , based on its rich cultural heritage , raise its own . 
Creating meaning and preserving values is probably the one task that Europe has to undertake on behalf of the entire world . 
If the EU focuses on infusing its goods and services with Europe &apos;s guiding ideas and values , its economy will reap significant rewards . 
This will require an explicit emphasis on ensuring the conditions that promote and sustain creativity , and the updated Lisbon Strategy that is to be launched in March should include a commitment that Europe will move in this direction .
