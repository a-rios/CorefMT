Hollande in Mali 
PARIS - While hundreds of thousands demonstrated in Paris against the right of homosexual couples to marry and adopt children , French troops were arriving in Mali to stop a coalition of Islamist and rebel forces from taking control of its capital , Bamako , and creating in the Sahel a sanctuary for terrorists . 
These are trying times for French President Fran√ßois Hollande . 
Besieged economically at home , where his popularity is at its lowest since his election last year , can he regain credibility , if not support , as supreme commander of French forces ? 
Once upon a time , &quot; I intervene , therefore I am &quot; might as well have been a French motto , particularly in Africa . 
The benefits have become more dubious , while the costs and risks have grown increasingly evident . 
If France has again become a regional gendarme by default , it is largely for three reasons . 
American enthusiasm for intervention in Africa has greatly diminished since the operation in Somalia in 1992-1993 - and more globally following the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
European interest in military intervention in Africa is as low as ever . 
And , as for the region &apos;s governments , it would be an understatement to say that they are not yet ready militarily to take their fate into their own hands . 
While France is not alone - manifestations of support have come from its Western and African partners , as well as from the Middle East - it will bear the primary responsibility and the risks . 
For Islamic fundamentalists , France is now the &quot; Great Satan . &quot; 
Indeed , the conflict in Mali is taking place geographically in Africa , but in many ways its causes and ramifications lie in the Middle East . 
When France intervened in an African country in the past , there was no risk of terrorist attacks on its territory or on its citizens elsewhere in the world . 
That is no longer the case . 
It is too early to say what will happen in Mali or the Sahel - or , for that matter , in France itself . 
For the moment , the French are standing , overwhelmingly , behind Hollande . 
They would have criticized him had he remained passive while Bamako fell into the hands of terrorists . 
Yet this support may be fragile , and could collapse if something goes wrong on the ground - or , worse , in France . 
Before the intervention , Mali was not a French priority . 
Rising unemployment at home seemed to be a more urgent task than did addressing instability in Africa . 
While the French public agrees that Mali cannot be allowed to become a haven for terrorists , the way Afghanistan did in the late 1990 &quot; s , attitudes toward intervention have evolved in recent decades . 
In the early 1980 &quot; s , after a particularly bloody terrorist attack on French and American forces in Lebanon , France &apos;s tolerance for military casualties seemed much higher than that of the United States . 
The French now find themselves on the front line at a time when they have much less appetite for it . 
Moreover , budget restrictions have severely constrained French military capabilities . 
French and British military intervention was successful in Libya in 2011 at least in part as a result of US military procurement . 
Of course , from a French perspective , the US role is somewhat ironic . 
In the years after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Americans always had to be on the front line - battling the enemy abroad to avoid having to battle him at home , in the parlance of the time - while the European allies were perceived as the cleaning staff . 
Americans are starting to enjoy - probably too much for their allies - what President Barack Obama , describing the US role in Libya , called &quot; leading from behind . &quot; 
For Hollande , war in Mali is both an opportunity and a risk . 
If Nicolas Sarkozy , whom he defeated , was widely regarded as &quot; too &quot; presidential , Hollande has given the impression of not being presidential &quot; enough . &quot; 
His fall from public grace - too statist and fiscally intrusive for the right , but too moderate and social democratic for the true left - was more rapid than that of any president of the Fifth Republic . 
Of course , with unemployment rising every month , it is difficult to remain popular for long . 
As the supreme commander of an army at war , Hollande can now try to reinvent himself . 
France &apos;s citizens have tended to expect too much from their state , and now they may be expecting too little from politics and politicians at a time when deep divisions on fundamental economic and social issues run not only between the traditional right and left , but also within both camps . 
Will foreign intervention reunite the French ? 
Will war in Africa be the defining moment of Hollande &apos;s presidency ? 
Will he be remembered as the French Harry Truman - a discreet , uncharismatic man who , when faced with urgent and dramatic circumstances , ended up doing the right things for lack of a better alternative ? 
This is a portentous moment both for Mali and for security in the Sahel and Europe . 
It is no less significant for Hollande and France .
