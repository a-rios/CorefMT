Financing the Fight Against Climate Change 
PARIS - Climate change is already wreaking havoc throughout the developing world . 
Vietnam , for example , has reported that natural disasters , some of them exacerbated by climate change , have caused annual losses equivalent to 2 % of its GDP . 
In agriculture-dependent countries like Ethiopia , longer droughts and more frequent flooding are threatening livelihoods and food supplies . 
As the international community gears up for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December , identifying and streamlining sources of financing for the fight against climate change must be a top priority . 
Development banks like the French Development Agency ( AFD ) , where I am CEO , are well placed to contribute . 
For starters , development banks can finance projects that benefit both development and the environment . 
Global warming is now a vital factor to consider when planning any development project . 
For example , the effects of climate change can pose critical risks to infrastructure - agricultural irrigation , public transportation , or nearly anything else . 
Meanwhile , rising incomes - a goal of any development effort - nearly always means increased consumption of natural resources and energy , resulting in more emissions and further warming . 
Such interlocking relationships between global warming and development explain why the French government requires that at least 50 % of the funding provided by the AFD be directed toward development projects that also have a positive impact on the environment . 
Examples include wind farms in Ethiopia , better forest management in Madagascar , nationwide climate plans in Indonesia and Vietnam , and clean urban transport in Colombia . 
Development banks can also play an important role in designing financial tools that allow private investors to contribute to the fight against climate change . 
Though potential sources for climate-friendly development financing now include pension funds , insurance companies , foundations , and sovereign wealth funds , what is often missing are mechanisms to ensure that investments are channeled into well-targeted and effective projects . 
One solution is &quot; green &quot; ( or &quot; climate &quot; ) bonds . 
These instruments have all the characteristics of conventional bonds , but they are backed by investments that contribute to sustainable development or the fight against climate change . 
Until recently , only a few organizations or governments , including the World Bank , the American state of Massachusetts , and the French region of Île de France , issued green bonds , and generally the amounts involved were modest . 
In 2014 , emissions of green bonds exceeded the total in all previous years combined . 
Indeed , demand is outstripping supply . 
The latest bond offers were all oversubscribed - and the trend is likely to continue . 
The insurance industry has committed to double its green investments , to $ 84 billion , by the end of 2015 . 
As the market for these bonds expands , they must be better labeled and certified . 
Today , harmonized standards do not exist . 
The quality of the assets backing the bonds depends solely on issuers &quot; goodwill and technical skills . 
Specific guidelines and rating methods need to be developed . 
In this context , the recent decision by a coalition of institutional investors to measure and disclose the carbon footprint of at least $ 500 billion in investments is a step forward . 
In September , the AFD issued € 1 billion ( $ 1.2 billion ) in climate bonds , with one goal being to contribute to the development of concrete quality standards . 
With the help of a major agency that rates corporate social responsibility , we were able to provide investors with solid information - and an accountability process - about the portfolio &apos;s direct impact on greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Indeed , the projects financed by these bonds were required to meet stringent criteria , including a prior analysis of their carbon footprint , proof of a clear and significant impact on climate change , and a design that is aligned with the broader strategies being pursued by local actors and countries . 
Climate bonds have the potential to empower countries and institutions as they move toward meeting enforceable commitments to reduce CO2 emissions . 
However , if they are to be effective , they will require clear guidelines and a reliable framework for assessment . 
As leaders from countries and institutions from around the world prepare to meet in Paris in December , getting the financing right should be a top priority .
