Will Europe Be Willing but Disabled ? 
NEWPORT BEACH - When it comes to describing Europe &apos;s ever-worsening crisis , metaphors abound . 
For some , it is five minutes to midnight ; for others , Europe is a car accelerating towards the edge of a cliff . 
For all , a perilous existential moment is increasingly close at hand . 
Optimists - fortunately , there remain a few , especially in Europe itself - believe that when the situation becomes really critical , political leaders will turn things around and put Europe back on the path of economic growth , job creation , and financial stability . 
But pessimists have been growing in number and influence . 
They see political dysfunction adding to financial turmoil , thereby amplifying the eurozone &apos;s initial design flaws . 
Of course , who is ultimately proven correct is a function of eurozone governments &quot; willingness to make the difficult decisions that are required , and in a coordinated and timely fashion . 
But that is not the only determinant : governments must also be able to turn things around once the willingness to do so materializes . 
And here , the endless delays are making the challenges more daunting and the outcome more uncertain . 
Experienced observers remind us that crises , rather than vision , have tended to drive progress at critical stages of Europe &apos;s historic integration - a multi-decade journey driven by the desire to ensure long-term peace and prosperity in what previously had been one of the world &apos;s most violent regions and the site of appalling human suffering . 
After all , the European Union ( including the eurozone &apos;s 17 members ) remains a collective of nation-states with notable divergences in economic , financial , and social conditions . 
Cultural differences persist . 
Political cycles are far from synchronized . 
And too many regional governance mechanisms , with the important exception of the European Central Bank , lack sufficient influence , credibility , and , therefore , effectiveness . 
Left to its own devices , such a grouping is vulnerable to recurrent bickering , disruptive posturing , and disagreement over visions of the future . 
As a result , progress towards meaningful economic and political integration can be painfully slow during the good times . 
But all of this can change rapidly when a crisis looms , especially if it threatens the integrity of the European project . 
That is where the eurozone is today . 
A debt crisis that erupted in Greece , the eurozone &apos;s outer periphery , has migrated with a vengeance towards the core , so much so that the survival of the eurozone itself is at stake . 
The more the policy response has lagged , the broader the set of questions about Europe &apos;s future has become . 
Maintaining a 17-member monetary union is no longer a given . 
Talk of countries exiting , starting with Greece ( the &quot; Grexit &quot; ) , is now rampant . 
And only hard-core idealists dismiss altogether the mounting risk of the eurozone &apos;s total disintegration . 
Nonetheless , many veterans of the European integration project see a silver lining in the dark clouds massing over their creation . 
For them , only a crisis can stop politicians from just kicking various cans farther down the road and , instead , catalyze the policy initiatives - greater fiscal , banking , and political union - that , together with monetary union , would ensure that the eurozone rests on a stable and sustainable four-legged platform . 
But this view is not without its own risks . 
It assumes that , when push comes to shove , political leaders will indeed do what is necessary - the willingness question . 
It also presumes that they will have the capacity to do so - the ability question . 
And , over time , uncertainty concerning the latter question has risen to an uncomfortable level . 
Today &apos;s eurozone is beset by an unprecedented degree of rejection - on economic , financial , political , and social grounds - by citizens in a growing number of countries . 
The longer this persists , the harder it will be for politicians to maintain control of their countries &quot; destinies and that of Europe &apos;s collective enterprise . 
Private-sector activity is slowing , and it is nearing a standstill in the eurozone &apos;s most vulnerable economy ( Greece ) , where a bank run is in full swing . 
Elsewhere , too , depositors are beginning to transfer their savings to the strongest economy ( Germany ) and to safe havens beyond ( Switzerland and the United States ) . 
Weaker companies are shedding labor , while stronger firms are delaying investments in plant and equipment . 
And global investors continue to exit the eurozone in droves , shifting countries &quot; liabilities to taxpayers and the ECB &apos;s balance sheet . 
No wonder that social unrest is evident in a growing number of countries . 
No wonder that fringe political movements are gaining traction throughout the eurozone . 
And no wonder that voters in almost two-thirds of eurozone countries have turned out the incumbents in their most recent elections . 
All of this serves to undermine the effectiveness of government policies - by reducing their credibility , clogging their channels of transmission to the economy , and making it difficult to offset the withdrawal of private-sector capital and spending . 
As a result , the market-based economic and financial systems that prevail in Europe , and that , not so long ago , were a source of significant strength , are losing their vibrancy . 
I , too , am fond of metaphors . 
During a trip to the continent last week , I heard one that captures very well the key dynamic in Europe today . 
The eurozone &apos;s leaders are on a raft heading towards a life-threatening waterfall . 
The longer they wait , the more the raft gains speed . 
So the outcome no longer depends only on their willingness to cooperate in order to navigate the raft to safety . 
The message is clear . 
The current crisis might indeed eventually break eurozone leaders &quot; inherent resistance to compromise , collaboration , and common action . 
But the longer they bicker and dither , the greater the risk that what they gain in willingness will be lost to incapacity .
