An Honest Man ? 
In his gushing account of President George W. Bush , the former presidential speechwriter David Frum tells us that his boss &quot; scorned the petty untruths of the politician . &quot; 
We learn , for example , that when asked to prepare a radio broadcast for the following day , he would begin reading , &quot; Today I am in California &quot; and quickly break off , saying with exasperation , &quot; But I &apos;m not in California . &quot; 
Frum thought this a bit pedantic , but concluded that it was emblematic of the President &apos;s character and that &quot; the country could trust the Bush administration not to cheat and not to lie . &quot; 
How wrong Frum now seems . 
Bush may naively consider it lying , and therefore wrong , to say that he is in California when he is recording a speech in Washington . 
But he fails to see anything gravely wrong about misleading his country and the world concerning Iraq &apos;s weapons of mass destruction . 
As we have seen , the White House built its case for war on a highly selective dossier of evidence , and Bush made statements about Iraq &apos;s attempt to purchase uranium from Africa that he and his staff knew to be highly doubtful , if not false . 
When questions were raised about how the statement about uranium was allowed to remain in Bush &apos;s State of the Union address , both National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld argued that it was not a lie . 
Their reasoning indicates that they , like the President , have a childishly literal notion of what it is to lie . 
Bush &apos;s actual words were these : &quot; The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . &quot; 
Bush &apos;s statement took this form because the CIA objected to the original version , which flatly stated that Saddam Hussein had sought to buy uranium from Africa . 
The White House staff member who discussed it with the CIA then suggested changing the sentence so that it stated that the British reported that Saddam Hussein had 
This was literally true , because the British had reported that . 
It was nevertheless misleading , for the CIA had informed the British that their information was not reliable . 
The fact that Bush only referred to a British statement is the basis for Rice and Rumsfeld &apos;s defense of it . 
Rice said that &quot; the statement that &#91; Bush &#93; made was indeed accurate . 
The British government did say that . &quot; 
Rumsfeld said that Bush &apos;s statement was &quot; technically accurate . &quot; 
In fact , even on the most literal interpretation , Bush &apos;s statement was not accurate . 
Bush did not say merely that the British had &quot; reported &quot; that Iraq had sought to buy uranium from Africa , but that the British had &quot; learned &quot; this . 
To say that someone has learned something is to endorse what they say they have learned as true . 
Imagine that the British had said that Saddam Hussein was a peace-loving man about to bring democracy to his country . 
Would Bush have said that the British had 
Quite apart from these weak attempts to justify Bush &apos;s statement as &quot; technically accurate , &quot; the more serious charge is that even if what Bush said really were technically accurate , it still would have been designed to mislead the world into thinking that Iraq had been trying to buy uranium in Africa . 
Bush and his staff had good reason to believe that this was not true . 
Bush &apos;s response to the issue after it became public shows him to be focused on the trivial and morally reckless about the essential . 
A person who is morally sensitive to the seriousness of starting a war on the basis of misleading information would take appropriate steps . 
He would ensure that the American public knew how the error occurred , and that whoever was responsible for it suffered the usual consequences that befall senior officials who make what was - to put the best possible interpretation on it - a grave error of judgment . 
But Bush did nothing of the sort . 
When the issue became public , Bush &apos;s response was to condemn his critics as &quot; revisionist historians &quot; and to evade questions about the credibility of the information he had provided by asserting that the removal of Saddam was a good outcome . 
Then he said that the CIA had cleared his speech , as if that absolved him of all responsibility . 
After CIA Director George Tenet took responsibility for the inclusion of the misleading material , Bush said that he &quot; absolutely &quot; had confidence in Tenet and the CIA , and that he considered the matter closed . 
Belief in Bush &apos;s honesty led many voters to prefer him to Albert Gore in the 2000 presidential election . 
Among voters who rated &quot; honesty &quot; as an important factor influencing their choice of candidate , 80 % said that they voted for Bush . 
These voters were disgusted with Clinton , not only for his sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky , but for lying about it . 
That Clinton did lie about his sexual activities is clear , and he was wrong to do so . 
But his lies did not lead his country into a war that has cost thousands of lives . 
Bush &apos;s excessively literal interpretation of the requirements of honesty conceals a deeper dishonesty whose consequences have been far more morally serious .
