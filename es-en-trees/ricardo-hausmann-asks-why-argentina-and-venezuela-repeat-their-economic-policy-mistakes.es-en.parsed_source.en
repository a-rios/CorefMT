Turning Good Economic Luck into Bad 
CAMBRIDGE , MA - It is often difficult to understand how countries that are dealt a pretty good economic hand can end up making a major mess of things . 
It is as if they were trying to commit suicide by jumping from the basement . 
Two of the most extreme cases ( but not the only ones ) are Argentina and Venezuela , countries that have benefited from high prices for their exports but have managed to miss the highway to prosperity by turning onto a dead-end street . 
They will eventually have to make a U-turn and backtrack over the terrain of fictitious progress . 
The puzzling thing is that this is not the first time either country has veered into an economic cul-de-sac . 
It has been said that only barbers learn on other people &apos;s heads , but some countries seem unable to learn even from their own experience . 
The ultimate reason for such self-destructiveness may be impossible to identify . 
But it is certainly possible to describe how the road to hell is paved , whatever the intentions . 
It all starts when some imbalance causes overall inflation or some key price - typically the exchange rate , but also power , water , and gasoline - to come under upward pressure . 
The government then uses its coercive power to keep a lid on price growth . 
For example , Brazil has wreaked havoc on the financial health of its national oil company , Petrobras , in order to keep gasoline prices low . 
Argentina destroyed its natural-gas sector with price controls . 
Many countries have kept power and water prices too low and have ended up with shortages . 
But things become really nasty when the government opts for foreign-exchange controls . 
The usual story , nicely summarized by the late Rüdiger Dornbusch and Sebastian Edwards , is that lax fiscal and monetary policies cause a flood of freshly printed currency to chase more dollars than the central bank can provide at the going exchange rate . 
Rather than let the currency depreciate , or tighten its policies , the government opts for foreign-exchange controls , limiting access to dollars to those who &quot; really &quot; need it and thus preventing &quot; speculators &quot; from hurting &quot; the people . &quot; 
Foreign-exchange controls , typically accompanied by price controls , give the government the sense that it can have its cake ( lax policies ) and eat low inflation . 
But controls lead to a parallel exchange rate , which can be either legal , as in Argentina , or illegal and even unpublishable , as in Venezuela . 
But having two prices for an identical dollar creates enormous arbitrage opportunities . 
A dollar purchased at the official rate can be sold for almost twice as much in the &quot; blue &quot; market in Argentina and a whopping ten times more in Venezuela . 
Repeat that game a few times and you will be able to afford a corporate jet . 
Nothing becomes more profitable than over-invoicing imports and under-invoicing exports . 
In Venezuela , importing spoiled food and letting it rot is more profitable than any investment anywhere else in the world ( disregarding , of course , the bribes needed to make it happen ) . 
The dual-exchange-rate system ends up distorting production incentives and causing the effective supply of imported goods to decline , leading to a combination of inflation and shortages . 
But here things turn interesting . 
Public spending tends to rise with inflation more than government revenues do , because revenues depend on the tax on exports , which is calculated at the pegged official exchange rate . 
So , over time , fiscal accounts worsen automatically , creating a vicious circle : monetized fiscal deficits lead to inflation and a widening gap in the parallel exchange-rate market which worsens the fiscal deficit . 
Eventually , a major adjustment of the official rate becomes inevitable . 
For example , when Hugo Chávez was first elected President in 1998 , the Venezuelan bolívar could be exchanged for 2,610 Colombian pesos . 
Today , despite a raft of foreign-exchange controls , a bolívar is worth barely 300 pesos at the official exchange rate ( which is soon to be readjusted ) ; one would be lucky to get 30 pesos at the black-market rate . 
Not surprisingly , prices in Venezuela rise in one month more than they do in two years in neighboring Colombia . 
Why do countries opt for such a strategy ? 
Any system creates winners and losers . 
In Argentina and Venezuela , the winners are those who have preferential access to foreign exchange , those who benefit from the government &apos;s profligacy , those who can borrow at the negative real interest rates that lax policies create , and those who do not mind waiting in long lines to buy rationed items . 
Such a system can generate a self-reinforcing set of popular beliefs , which may explain why countries like Argentina and Venezuela repeatedly drive down dead-end streets . 
Because so many businesses make money from the rents created by the rationing of foreign exchange , rather than by creating value , it is easy to believe that markets do not work , that entrepreneurs are speculators , and that governments need to control them and impose &quot; fair &quot; prices . 
All too often , this allows governments to blame the car , and even the passengers , for getting lost .
