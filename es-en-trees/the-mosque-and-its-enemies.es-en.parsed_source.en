The Mosque and Its Enemies 
WASHINGTON , DC - Opposition to plans to build a mosque near &quot; Ground Zero , &quot; the spot where the World Trade Center &apos;s twin towers fell on September 11 , 2001 , comes in various shades . 
To their credit , many of the project &apos;s opponents have avoided the crass bigotry that is becoming a standard trait of right-wing discourse in the United States . 
The first of these misbegotten assumptions is to underrate social intolerance as a threat to freedom . 
While accepting the project &apos;s impeccable legal credentials , its opponents nevertheless demand that it be relocated on the grounds that even fully lawful conduct may be offensive to a group of citizens . 
This is a dangerous road to take in a liberal society . 
More than 150 years ago , in his essay On Liberty , John Stuart Mill demolished the belief that the quest for individual freedom is , above all , a struggle against the state . 
This belief still features prominently in the rhetorical arsenal of US conservatives , notably in the inflamed proclamations of the Tea Party movement . 
Indeed , up until the 1967 Supreme Court ruling that struck down anti-miscegenation laws throughout the US , interracial marriages were an oddity even where they were legally allowed . 
A majority considered them offensive , and therefore expected interracial couples to show what is demanded today from Muslims in Manhattan : respect for other people &apos;s sensitivities . 
In a nation of laws , such as the US , it is disingenuous and unfair to grant legal protection to a right - in this case the right to worship God as we see fit - and then selectively ban its exercise de facto because a majority or minority takes offense . 
Thus , the strident calls to stop the Park 51 project are as serious a threat to freedom as an outright legal ban . 
If Muslims are not to be allowed to build anything Islamic anywhere near Ground Zero , let those who feel insulted strive to change the law through an open democratic process in which the reasons for a legal ban can be argued openly and without fig leafs . 
Democracy demands no less . 
The second , more invidious assumption of the opponents of Park 51 concerns what happened in September 2001 . 
Some of the project &apos;s adversaries claim that it must be stopped because it will be a tribute to the perpetrators of a despicable deed . 
Underlying this argument is the idea that the attack was an explicitly religious act carried out by an enemy faith , whose believers - even those who denounced the atrocity - are tainted and deserve to have their constitutional rights restricted . 
Feeling uncomfortable with this rationale , other opponents deny the religious nature of the dispute and make clear that theirs is not a quarrel with Islam . 
Of course , if their reasoning were followed to its logical conclusion , allowing the project to be built would be the most robust statement that this dispute really does not have anything to do with religion . 
The real problem , however , lies elsewhere . 
For the moment one stops seeing the terrorist attacks of 2001 as a purely religious statement , one is forced to confront the elephant in the room : the attacks were , in essence , a political statement . 
At its root it is possible to find concrete US government decisions made over the years , from nurturing alliances with corrupt and authoritarian Middle Eastern regimes to maintaining a conspicuous military presence in Saudi Arabia and showing a general obliviousness to the plight of Palestinians in the occupied territories . 
The policies that resulted from these decisions may or may not be necessary for America &apos;s long-term security interests , but it is undeniable that they have fueled a backlash in the Muslim world which has , on occasion , reared its head in murderous ways . 
In any case , disputes over these policies are far from a theological conflict . 
For nearly a decade , any attempt to recast the debate about the events of September 11 , 2001 , away from the prevailing theological narrative has been depicted as subversive and unpatriotic . 
One only has to recall the vitriol visited upon Rev. Jeremiah Wright during the last presidential campaign for his now infamous sermon in which he said that , with the attacks , the chickens of US foreign policy had come home to roost . 
It is possible to disagree with Wright and his ilk , but it is hardly disputable that public debate in the US has systematically failed to engage in a serious discussion about the disturbing political issues that lurk beneath - although never justify - those attacks . 
Perhaps that is why most opponents of Park 51 have sought refuge in the religious narrative of the terrorist attacks . 
After all , it is a narrative that , while demanding a suspension of one &apos;s critical faculties , bestows an unmitigated blessing upon those purportedly fighting on the side of light . 
The other option - that US policy was in the terrorists &quot; crosshairs - is too upsetting for these opponents to contemplate . 
We can only hope that the American public will reject not just the insistent calls to derail the construction of the Park 51 project , but also the contested assumptions that underpin opposition to it . 
Doing so would re-affirm American freedom and tolerance , and make the US a stronger and more respected actor abroad .
