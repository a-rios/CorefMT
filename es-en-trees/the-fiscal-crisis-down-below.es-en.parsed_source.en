The Fiscal Crisis Down Below 
PALO ALTO - Sub-national governments - states , countries , cities , provinces , towns , and special districts - play different roles from country to country , but usually deliver important public services such as police and fire protection , transportation , education , health care , and welfare . 
In many countries , their fiscal position has collapsed under the combined weight of mismanagement and the global economic and financial crisis . 
The relationship between sub-national and central governments includes the general division of responsibilities for providing and financing public services ; national subsidies that at least partly pay for various services delivered locally ; and tax collection . 
In the United States , the federal government has primary responsibility for defense , public old-age pensions ( Social Security ) , and health care for the elderly ( Medicare ) ; sub-national governments are responsible for education and law enforcement . 
Health care for the poor ( Medicaid ) is a shared responsibility . 
Matching funds flow from the federal government to state and local governments by formulae delineating the shared responsibilities . 
Some of these formulae allow sub-national governments wide discretion ; others do not . 
The global economic and financial crisis has precipitated an immense expansion of central government spending , borrowing ( and hence future taxing ) , lending , regulation , and mandates , some in &quot; aid &quot; to sub-national governments ( about $ 200 billion in the US stimulus bill ) . 
A key question is whether central governments &quot; power worldwide will expand permanently - over not only the private economy , but also over sub-national governments . 
There is remarkable variability in the role of sub-national governments relative to central governments . 
Prior to the current crisis , US government revenue was roughly 60 % federal and 40 % state and local . 
France was the most centralized of the major economies , with roughly a 80 % -20 % split between the national and sub-national governments , while the United Kingdom falls in between , at 75 % -25 % . 
China was the least centralized , at 30 % -70 % . Argentina was the most balanced , at about 50 % -50 % . 
Debates about government centralization run deep in the history and constitutions of most countries . 
The US Constitution knitted together the thirteen original colonies , and its Tenth Amendment reserves to the states all powers not expressly delegated to the federal government . 
Even today , tensions over further centralization ( e.g. , to supranational authority , as in Europe ) and devolution ( e.g. , for Scotland , Qu√©bec , or Kurdistan ) are intense . 
There are several reasons to favor a healthy dose of decentralization . 
US Supreme Court Judge Louis Brandeis famously argued for &quot; the states as laboratories . &quot; 
A recent example in the US was welfare reform . 
When states got waivers for time limits and work or training requirements for welfare recipients , they were so successful that federal welfare reform followed . 
Competition among localities - for example , between states for businesses and workers , and between school districts for students - can lead to more efficient and effective allocation of public resources . 
If people are able to migrate , they will move to jurisdictions with the mix of taxes and services ( e.g. , quality schools ) that they prefer . 
As with competition in private markets , competition in government services leads to better outcomes . 
Local authorities are closer to problems than national officials tucked away in a country &apos;s capital . 
There are important differences among jurisdictions . 
Hospitals are more important for some areas , while schools are more important for others . 
Geographic cost-of-living differences are difficult to reflect in one-size-fits-all national programs . 
Some functions are better suited for central-government financing . 
National defense is an obvious example , as are functions for which economies of scale are important . 
Where localities try to offload support for the poor onto other localities , the central government must step in and either fund such programs directly or set minimum standards . 
In the US until the past three decades , local school districts were responsible for education . 
Various court rulings have determined that this process allowed richer districts to spend more than poorer ones and ordered states to equalize spending . 
States from California to Texas now routinely collect previously local property taxes to fund schools , and then redistribute them to local school districts . 
Many believe that the reduction of local control over the schools as a result of the elimination of local financing has been a major contributor to the poor performance of some American schools . 
California is an example of long-run fiscal folly meeting short-run national and global economic crisis , resulting in chaos . 
For many decades , Californians had rapidly rising living standards , great public K-12 and higher education systems , and unprecedented upward mobility . 
People and jobs are seeking better opportunities elsewhere . 
The state &apos;s bond rating is dead last . 
Excessive state spending , heavy regulation , and dangerously high taxes have helped create the state &apos;s economic woes . 
The top personal income-tax rate ( also levied on capital gains ) , the sales tax rate , the corporate tax rate , and the gas tax are all at or near the highest of any state . 
The top 1 % of the state &apos;s income earners pay almost half the income taxes . 
Ironically , California &apos;s progressive tax and spending policies create such volatility that they destroy the state &apos;s ability to fund everything , even basic services from education to health for its most vulnerable citizens . 
Now facing another $ 20 billion deficit despite temporary tax hikes and spending cuts , California &apos;s fiscal woes foreshadow those of many sub-national - or , indeed , national -governments globally . 
While all must first deal with the current emergency , sensible local fiscal , tax , and political reforms are vital to restore a balance of centralized and decentralized government .
