Growing Up in the Eurozone 
MILAN - A rapid and large increase of government debt has been a general phenomenon in the advanced countries since the 2007-09 crisis : for the first time , the average debt / GDP ratio for OECD countries has surpassed 100 % . 
Fiscal consolidation will weigh on growth prospects for two generations to come , and the welfare state as we have known it in Europe since World War II will have to be transformed , especially given a rapidly aging population . 
But the eurozone debt crisis has distinctive features . 
Most importantly , while the average debt / GDP ratio is no higher than it is in other advanced countries , and consolidation efforts started earlier , the eurozone has been mired in a severe crisis of confidence for the past two years . 
This points to a systemic dimension of the crisis that cannot be reduced to profligate behavior by fiscal sinners . 
Indeed , the Greek crisis exposed three main flaws in the monetary union itself . 
First , the system lacked effective arrangements to align fiscal and other economic policies . 
As long as enforcement of fiscal discipline is entrusted to an intergovernmental body , the problem is bound to reappear , limiting the credibility of common budgetary rules . 
Moreover , financial markets underpriced private and sovereign credit risks , in the implicit belief that no one would fail , and that all debts would somehow be made whole , implying weak market discipline on borrowers . 
Finally , once the crisis hit , leading to a re-pricing of risks in financial markets , the need to avoid an economic and financial meltdown compelled governments to support aggregate demand and make private liabilities whole . 
But the disconnection between centralized monetary and decentralized fiscal powers de facto impeded the full use of monetary instruments to meet monetary and financial shocks . 
That left individual eurozone members exposed to brutal pressure by financial markets at a time when excessive private debt was turned into unsustainable public debt . 
Suddenly , the eurozone had become a straightjacket . 
And so it has remained : budgets are cut , growth falters , and periphery countries must engineer substantial real exchange-rate devaluations to regain competitiveness and close their external deficits . 
Core countries , meanwhile , argue that they can do little to strengthen aggregate demand and relieve pressure on their partners , even as the periphery &apos;s agony is dragging the core into recession , owing to its dependence on peripheral export markets . 
And , indeed , recent data point to a rapidly worsening economic environment in Germany , where the trade surplus has shrunk dramatically in recent months . 
Over the past two years , fundamental changes in the eurozone &apos;s economic governance have aimed at rectifying the monetary union &apos;s founding flaws . 
And , along the way , an intergovernmental process has become communitarian . 
Key powers over the implementation of common policy guidelines have been entrusted to the European Commission , and the European Council has limited its own ability to reject Commission recommendations by requiring a qualified majority to change them . 
Strong economic-governance rules , however , will not suffice . 
A fully functioning monetary union also requires a central bank that is free to act as required to confront liquidity and confidence shocks , some mutualization of government debts , and centralized control over fiscal policy . 
Moreover , it must have centralized banking supervisory policies , with strong powers to manage bank crises and to liquidate banks that cannot be rescued . 
All of this can be achieved only gradually , as Europe moves to a fully-fledged federal union . 
Whether the eurozone will survive in the meantime will be determined by the European Council &apos;s capacity to establish intermediate arrangements that can halt the crisis and restore trust among its members . 
At their meeting at the end of June , European leaders acknowledged for the first time the multiple dimensions of the crisis , accepting that austerity - putting everyone &apos;s house in order - will not suffice . 
Accordingly , new joint policy initiatives will address economic growth , banking union , and liquidity . 
Moreover , European leaders have placed these new policies within a coherent longer-term framework that may also include &quot; the issuance of common debt . &quot; 
Likewise , the European Council has agreed on a new &quot; Compact for growth and jobs &quot; that identifies a specific European dimension of growth policies , mainly integration of energy , transport , communications , and services , together with higher infrastructure investment . 
What is notably missing is recognition of the need for greater flexibility on fiscal-consolidation efforts . 
As the Commission has requested , countries with stronger fiscal positions should consider slowing their consolidation efforts in order to avoid aggravating the recession . 
But , in order to preserve investors &quot; confidence , some eurozone countries must strike a difficult balance between austerity and overkill , which would have been facilitated had the European Council issued a clear statement that letting automatic stabilizers work , while remaining on track with structural budget targets , fully complies with European Union obligations . 
Moreover , a greater share of the adjustment burden must fall on Germany . 
Recent fairly generous wage agreements in Germany will help , but are not enough ; there is also a need to boost domestic demand . 
More aggressive liberalization of the bloated banking system , network services ( especially in energy and transport ) , and public procurement may contribute significantly over time to raising domestic investment and incomes . 
The sizeable investments required to make up for the loss of nuclear energy may contribute more immediate stimulus . 
All of this should not be seen as a concession , but as part of the obligations undertaken by eurozone governments to address excessive imbalances . 
Now more than ever , Germany must be persuaded that without its contribution in reviving growth and correcting external imbalances , the eurozone faces prolonged depression and certain collapse .
