A Triumph for &quot; Old Europe &quot; 
Italy may have defeated France to win the World Cup , but the real winner was the &quot; Old Europe &quot; that Donald Rumsfeld once derided . 
After all , who would have predicted a World Cup final between France and Italy ? 
It looks as if the national teams of the two &quot; sick men of Europe , &quot; felt obliged to change their countries &quot; images in the world . 
In the Italian case , following the corruption scandals that have nearly sunk Il Calcio , Italy &apos;s premier football league , the national team had to rehabilitate the game in the eyes of their fellow citizens . 
More globally , however , it is as if &quot; Old Europe &quot; had decided that it was time to set the record straight and prove more dynamic than the world &apos;s emerging forces . 
Indeed , in the new global balance , where football has become much more than sport , Europe is back with a vengeance . 
What has been unfolding in front of our eyes in the last four weeks has been a modern and reduced version of the balance-of-power system that dominated Europe and the world in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . 
If football and its culminating moment , the World Cup , has become the universal religion of the global age , this is above all because it fulfills , in a non-spiritual way , contradictory instincts in human nature . 
Football magnifies the cult of the individual and the glorification of the hero , but it is also a celebration of the cooperative team spirit . 
More than any other collective activity , it channels the search for identity and identification that dominates our age . 
Thanks to the World Cup , one is a citizen of the world , enjoying a spectacle together with billions of others on &quot; Planet Soccer . &quot; 
Even in Washington , where I arrived at the beginning of the tournament , I was greeted at the airport by television screens showing the game . 
The program was in English , but the advertisements were in Spanish . 
In terms of football at least , the Hispanic community &apos;s influence has brought the United States closer to Europe ( though not , of course , in its team &apos;s performance on the pitch ) . 
At the same time , during the World Cup , fans are not only universal ; they are also unique , and they can express their difference with impunity , sometimes in the most assertive , aggressive , and , unfortunately , occasionally racist manner . 
In a world of &quot; multiple identities , &quot; to choose one &apos;s team is in part to decide who one is . 
From this standpoint , this year &apos;s World Cup has not only witnessed the triumph of European nations - all semi-finalists were European for the first time since 1982 - but also the absence of even a glimmer of European emotions . 
In my country , France , most supporters were clearly motivated more by post-colonial references than by European allegiance . 
African teams , except when they were playing against France , were favored over those from the European Union . 
As I watched the Croatia-Australia match early in the tournament , I surprised myself , too , as I realized that my emotions were with the Australian team , whatever that could mean , given that there were so many Croatians playing for Australia . 
This deep search for identification should not be confused with a simple surge of nationalism . 
Reality is more complex . 
And this is not only because many coaches of the national teams are , like in the good old days , &quot; foreign mercenaries , &quot; with this Cup &apos;s Swiss guards including the Brazilian coaches of Japan and Portugal , the Swedish coach of England , and the French coach of Tunisia . 
The Cup &apos;s explosions of proud nationalism hide more tortured realities . 
Nostalgia is not what it used to be . 
In 1998 , when France won the Cup for the first time , the three colors of the French flag ( blue , white , and red ) were celebrated alongside with the three colors ( &quot; black , white , and 
Indeed , after the violent episodes of the last year , France &apos;s immigrant communities have a very different message to deliver : &quot; Without us , you would not have had this World Cup success . 
Do you believe you can continue to ostracize the communities from which your soccer heroes come ? &quot; 
From ping-pong diplomacy with China to the united German Olympic team that competed in 1990 before actual reunification , sport has prefigured political developments , and politicians everywhere have seized on the importance of the World Cup . 
Football success has become part of countries &quot; &quot; soft power . &quot; 
France may not have the military might of the US or the growth rate of China and India , but its team reached the World Cup championship , raising its standing in the eyes of billions of people - and perhaps giving a reprieve to its unpopular government . 
But sport can also become a kind of gigantic , distracting screen behind which nasty regimes do outrageous things - the very opposite of the Olympic and World Cup spirit . 
As the world was watching the football games in Germany , North Korea was testing long-range missiles and Palestinians in the governing Hamas launched attacks on Israel that prompted a bloody invasion of Gaza . 
The World Cup is drama , excitement , a dream , but it is also a form of &quot; global escapism . &quot; 
Football may explain the world , but it does not improve it . 
And now we are back to reality .
