The Wrong Way to Think About Oil 
In his recent State of the Union address , President George W. Bush declared , &quot; America is addicted to oil . &quot; 
But even if his program succeeds , it will not do much to increase America &apos;s energy security . 
Americans are not alone in worrying about oil as a security problem . 
China and India , the two largest countries in the world , realize that their high rates of economic growth also depend upon foreign oil . 
While the two countries together consume slightly less than half as much oil as the US , their consumption is increasing faster . 
When poor countries consume as much per capita as rich countries , will there be enough oil to go around ? 
China and India have been crisscrossing the globe making financially and politically costly deals to try to lock up the output of new oil-producing countries . 
For example , when Western countries discouraged their oil companies from dealing with Sudan &apos;s government because of its inadequate response to the genocide in Darfur , China was quick to buy up the country &apos;s oil . 
Some petroleum experts argue that world oil production will peak in a decade or so . 
Others reply that new discoveries and improved technologies for extracting oil from existing fields make such projections too alarmist . 
Because accurate statistics about reserves in countries like Saudi Arabia are not available , it is impossible to settle the dispute definitively . 
But the majority of experts agree that the world will not run out of oil anytime soon - even with growing Chinese and Indian demand . 
Over a trillion barrels of reserves have been proven , and more are likely to be found . 
In any case , arguments about the size of world oil reserves and when global production will peak misses the key security issue . 
The heart of the problem is not the overall quantity of oil , but its location . 
Two-thirds of proven reserves are in the Persian Gulf , one of the world &apos;s most volatile regions . 
Oil supply is likely to be vulnerable to political disruptions long before issues arise from overall scarcity of supply . 
For China and India , that just reinforces their desire to lock up oil supplies from countries outside the Persian Gulf . 
Similarly , it led Bush to his declared objective of cutting imports from the region by 75 % over the next two decades . 
At first glance , Bush &apos;s task looks easy . 
The US uses about 21 million barrels of oil a day , and imports about 2.5 million of it from the Persian Gulf . 
Even before new technologies produce that amount of fuel , the US could switch to imports from Nigeria , Venezuela , and other countries . 
But even if those countries remain stable , America will not be safe . 
What matters is the total amount of oil a country imports , not where it comes from . 
Suppose there is a crisis in the Persian Gulf over Iran &apos;s efforts to get nuclear weapons . 
Iran has threatened to cut oil exports if the United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions against it for violating its nuclear pledges . 
Most experts predict that such a move would drive the price of oil - including the Venezuelan , Nigerian , and other oil that the US , China , and India consume - above $ 100 per barrel . 
The rapid spike in prices would harm all economies that import oil , regardless of where it comes from . 
The world learned that lesson following the 1973 Arab-Israel war . 
Arab oil-exporting countries embargoed oil sales to the US and the Netherlands to punish them for their support of Israel . 
But the oil destined for the US and the Netherlands was shifted to other countries like Japan , while oil destined for other countries found its way to the US and the Netherlands . 
Oil is a fungible commodity , and markets clear at a common price . 
When the dust settled , it turned out that American , Dutch , and other importers all suffered roughly the same degree of shortfall and paid the same damaging high price . 
This means that China and India are deluding themselves if they think that preferential deals for Sudanese or Iranian oil will provide them with security . 
When a disruption occurs , China , India , and the US will all find that they face equal prices ­ ­ - and thus equal pain . 
In the meantime , China &apos;s mercantilist misunderstanding of markets means that it often overpays for what it mistakenly thinks is energy security . 
Bush is similarly mistaken . 
In the past , rising prices helped slow oil consumption in the US . 
But over half the oil Americans use goes for driving cars and trucks . 
The US will not solve its energy security problem until it gets better at fuel economy , possibly by a combination of technology , gasoline taxes , and regulations . 
Oil was not the cause of the Iraq War in the simplistic sense that American control of Iraqi oil would make it more secure . 
The world &apos;s dependence on Persian Gulf oil means that all countries have an interest in maintaining stability in that region , while improving energy efficiency and increasing the diversity of their overall energy supplies .
