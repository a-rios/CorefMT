The Problem with Poor Countries &quot; GDP 
SEATTLE - Even in good financial times , development aid budgets are hardly overflowing . 
Government leaders and donors must make hard decisions about where to focus their limited resources . 
How do you decide which countries should get low-cost loans or cheaper vaccines , and which can afford to fund their own development programs ? 
The answer depends , in part , on how we measure growth and improvements in people &apos;s lives . 
Traditionally , one of the guiding factors has been per capita GDP - the value of goods and services produced by a country in a year divided by the country &apos;s population . 
Yet GDP may be an inaccurate indicator in the poorest countries , which is a concern not only for policymakers or people like me who read lots of World Bank reports , but also for anyone who wants to use statistics to make the case for helping the world &apos;s poorest people . 
I have long believed that GDP understates growth even in rich countries , where its measurement is quite sophisticated , because it is very difficult to compare the value of baskets of goods across different time periods . 
In the United States , for example , a set of encyclopedias in 1960 was expensive but held great value for families with studious kids . 
Now , thanks to the Internet , kids have access to far more information for free . 
How do you factor that into GDP ? 
The challenges of calculating GDP are particularly acute in Sub-Saharan Africa , owing to weak national statistics offices and historical biases that muddy crucial measurements . 
Bothered by what he regarded as problems in Zambia &apos;s national statistics , Morten Jerven , an assistant professor at Simon Fraser University , spent four years examining how African countries obtain their data and the challenges they face in turning them into GDP estimates . 
His new book , Poor Numbers : How We Are Misled by African Development Statistics and What to Do about It , makes a strong case that a lot of GDP measurements that we thought were accurate are far from it . 
Jerven notes that many African countries have trouble measuring the size of their relatively large subsistence economies and unrecorded economic activity . 
How do you account for the production of a farmer who grows and eats his own food ? 
If subsistence farming is systematically underestimated , some of what looks like growth as an economy moves out of subsistence may merely reflect a shift to something that is easier to capture statistically . 
There are other problems with poor countries &quot; GDP data . 
For example , many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa do not update their reporting often enough , so their GDP numbers may miss large and fast-growing economic sectors , like cell phones . 
When Ghana updated its reporting a few years ago , its GDP jumped by 60 % . 
In addition , there are several ways to calculate GDP , and they can produce wildly different results . 
Jerven mentions three : the World Development Indicators , published by the World Bank ( by far the most commonly used dataset ) ; the Penn World Table , released by the University of Pennsylvania ; and the Maddison Project at the University of Groningen , which is based on work by the late economist Angus Maddison . 
These sources rely on the same basic data , but they modify it in different ways to account for inflation and other factors . 
As a result , their rankings of different countries &quot; economies can vary widely . 
Liberia is Sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s second-poorest , seventh-poorest , or 22nd-poorest country in terms of GDP , depending on which authority you consult . 
It is not only the relative rankings that differ . 
Sometimes , one source will show a country growing by several percentage points , and another source will show it shrinking over the same time period . 
Jerven cites these discrepancies to argue that we cannot be certain whether one poor country &apos;s GDP is higher than another &apos;s , and that we should not use GDP alone to make judgments about which economic policies lead to growth . 
Does that mean that we really don &apos;t know anything about what works ( and what doesn &apos;t ) in development ? 
Not at all . 
Researchers have long used techniques like periodic household surveys to collect data . 
For example , the Demographic and Health Survey is conducted regularly to determine things like childhood and maternal death rates . 
Moreover , economists are using new techniques like satellite mapping of light sources to inform their estimates of economic growth . 
Although such methods are not perfect , they also are not susceptible to the same problems as GDP . 
Other ways to measure overall living standards in a country are similarly imperfect ; but they nonetheless provide additional ways to understand poverty . 
One , called the Human Development Index , uses health and education statistics in addition to GDP . 
Another , the Multidimensional Poverty Index , uses ten indicators , including nutrition , sanitation , and access to cooking fuel and water . 
And , by using purchasing power parity , which measures the cost of the same basket of goods and services in different countries , economists can adjust GDP to gain better insight into living standards . 
Yet it is clear to me that we need to devote greater resources to getting basic GDP numbers right . 
As Jerven argues , national statistics offices across Africa need more support so that they can obtain and report timelier and more accurate data . 
Donor governments and international organizations such as the World Bank need to do more to help African authorities produce a clearer picture of their economies . 
I &apos;m a big advocate for investing in health and development around the world . 
The better tools we have for measuring progress , the more we can ensure that those investments reach the people who need them the most .
