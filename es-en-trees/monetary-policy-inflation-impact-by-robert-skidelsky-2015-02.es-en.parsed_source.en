The Price Paradox 
LONDON - In 1923 , John Maynard Keynes addressed a fundamental economic question that remains valid today . 
&quot; Of the two perhaps deflation is ... the worse ; because it is worse ... to provoke unemployment than to disappoint the rentier . 
But it is not necessary that we should weigh one evil against the other . &quot; 
The logic of the argument seems irrefutable . 
Because many contracts are &quot; sticky &quot; ( that is , not easily revised ) in monetary terms , inflation and deflation would both inflict damage on the economy . 
Rising prices reduce the value of savings and pensions , while falling prices reduce profit expectations , encourage hoarding , and increase the real burden of debt . 
Keynes &apos;s dictum has become the ruling wisdom of monetary policy ( one of his few to survive ) . 
Governments , according to the conventional wisdom , should aim for stable prices , with a slight bias toward inflation to stimulate the &quot; animal spirits &quot; of businessmen and shoppers . 
In the ten years prior to the 2008 financial crisis , independent central banks set an inflation target of about 2 % , in order to provide economies with a price-stability &quot; anchor . &quot; 
There should be no expectation that prices would be allowed to deviate , except temporarily , from the target . 
Uncertainty relating to the future course of prices would be eliminated from business calculations . 
Since 2008 , the Federal Reserve Board and the European Central Bank have failed to meet the 2 % inflation target in any year ; the Bank of England ( BoE ) has been on target in only one year out of seven . 
Moreover , in 2015 , prices in the United States , the eurozone , and the United Kingdom are set to fall . 
So what is left of the inflation anchor ? 
And what do falling prices mean for economic recovery ? 
The first thing to bear in mind is that the &quot; anchor &quot; was always as flimsy as the monetary theory on which it was based . 
The price level at any time is the result of many factors , of which monetary policy is perhaps the least important . 
Today , the collapse in the price of crude oil is probably the most significant factor driving inflation below target , just as in 2011 it was the rise in oil prices that drove it above target . 
As British economist Roger Bootle pointed out in his 1996 book The Death of Inflation , the price-cutting effects of globalization have been a much more important influence on the price level than the anti-inflation policies of central banks . 
Indeed , the post-crisis experience of quantitative easing has highlighted monetary policy &apos;s relative powerlessness to offset the global deflationary trend . 
From 2009 to 2011 , the BoE pumped £ 375 billion ( $ 578 billion ) into the British economy &quot; to bring inflation back to target . &quot; 
The Fed injected $ 3 trillion over a slightly longer period . 
The most that can be claimed for this vast monetary expansion is that it produced a temporary &quot; spike &quot; in inflation . 
The old adage applies : &quot; You can lead a horse to water , but you can &apos;t make it drink . &quot; 
People cannot be forced to spend money if they have good reasons for not doing so . 
If business prospects are weak , companies are unlikely to invest ; if households are drowning in debt , they are unlikely to go on a spending spree . 
The ECB is about to discover the truth of this as it starts on its own € 1 trillion program of monetary expansion in an effort to stimulate the stagnant eurozone economy . 
So what happens to the recovery if we fall into what is euphemistically called &quot; negative inflation &quot; ? 
Until now , the consensus view has been that this would be bad for output and employment . 
Keynes gave the reason in 1923 : &quot; the fact of falling prices , &quot; he wrote , &quot; injures entrepreneurs ; consequently the fear of falling prices causes them to protect themselves by curtailing their operations . &quot; 
But many commentators have been cheered by the prospect of falling prices . 
Benign disinflation means rising real incomes for lenders , pensioners , and workers , and falling energy prices for industry . 
All sectors of the economy will spend more , pushing up output and employment ( and sustaining the price level , too ) . 
By contrast , &quot; bad deflation &quot; means an increase in the real burden of debt . 
A debtor contracts to pay a fixed sum in interest every year . 
If the value of money goes up ( prices fall ) , the interest he pays will cost him more , in terms of goods and services he can buy , than if prices had stayed the same . 
( In the reverse , inflationary case , the interest will cost him less . ) 
Thus , price deflation means debt inflation ; and a higher debt burden means lower spending . 
Given the huge levels of outstanding private and public debt , bad deflation , as Bootle writes , &quot; is a nightmare almost beyond imagining . &quot; 
But how can we stop benign disinflation from turning into bad deflation ? 
Apostles of monetary expansion believe that all you have to do is speed up the printing press . 
But why should this be any more successful in the future than it has been in the last few years ? 
Avoiding deflation - and thus sustaining economic recovery - would seem to depend on one of two scenarios : either a rapid reversal in the fall of energy prices , or a deliberate policy to raise output and employment by means of public investment ( which , as a byproduct , would bring about a rise in prices ) . 
But this would mean reversing the priority given to deficit reduction . 
No one can tell when the first will happen ; and no governments are prepared to do the second . 
So the most likely outcome is more of the same : continued drift in a state of semi-stagnation .
