The Great Hydrogen Hope 
RHINECLIFF , NEW YORK - In Jules Verne &apos;s novel The Mysterious Island , published in 1874 , Cyrus Harding , the book &apos;s engineer / hero , declares that &quot; water will one day be employed as fuel , that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it , used singly or together , will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light . &quot; 
Water , Harding announces , would be decomposed &quot; doubtless by electricity &quot; into hydrogen and oxygen . 
Many of Verne &apos;s musings remain fantasy , but where hydrogen is concerned , his time has come . 
Today , several hundred hydrogen-powered prototype cars , buses , vans and minivans , a motorcycle or two , a few scooters , utility vehicles ( including a slew of forklift trucks ) , and even a couple of farm tractors are already operating . 
Two years ago , the European Parliament in Strasbourg overwhelmingly passed a declaration urging a green hydrogen economy . 
The hydrogen projects are being developed in North America , Europe , Japan , Korea , Australia , South America , and , embryonically , in China and India . 
Most of the hydrogen-driven vehicles are powered by fuel cells , but both BMW and Mazda have converted gasoline engines to hydrogen fuel ( spiffy V-12s for BMW , rotary engines for Mazda ) . 
Indeed , such major carmakers as Toyota , Honda , Daimler , General Motors , and Hyundai / Kia are deep into plans for commercial production of cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells . 
Honda showed a prototype fuel cell car assembly line last year ; 
Daimler already launched one this year ; 
Hyundai / Kia plans to have one by 2012 , and Toyota , probably the biggest player , by 2015 , with small outputs initially , by the thousands later , and increasing steeply after that . 
Like natural gas , hydrogen can be used as a car fuel with engine modifications . 
But carmakers think fuel cells are the better , more efficient , silent , clean power source for transportation . 
They function somewhat like a battery , except that their fuel is constantly replenished , reacting electrochemically with the air &apos;s oxygen to make electricity to drive an electric motor . 
Today , such vehicles are hand-built and expensive , typically costing roughly a million dollars each , give or take a few hundred thousand dollars . 
But costs will come down once series production gets underway : Toyota says that it expects to &quot; shock &quot; the industry with its cost reduction numbers when it launches commercial production . 
It expects costs for the fuel cell stacks , the heart of the drive train , to decline as much as 90 % . 
In its most recent analysis , the US Department of Energy estimated that , using 2010 technology and assuming a production volume of 500,000 units , production costs for an 80-kilowatt fuel cell would be about $ 57 per kilowatt . 
With expected technology improvements , the cost would drop to about $ 47 / kW by 2015 , within shouting range of the department &apos;s target of $ 30 / kW , a benchmark figure that more or less corresponds to today &apos;s manufacturing cost for gasoline engines . 
As for hydrogen fuel costs , there are currently no fixed numbers , but the US target is $ 2-3 per kilogram by around 2018 ( a kilogram of hydrogen has about the same energy content as a gallon of gasoline ) . 
Because fuel cells are about twice as efficient as internal combustion engines , the effective cost per unit of distance would be about half that . 
The US has traditionally been in the forefront of research and development in this field , but in recent years hydrogen has been elbowed aside by intense lobbying for other alternatives . 
Some influential supporters argue plug-in hybrids , battery-powered vehicles , and biodiesel cars are closer to market , and that they are better , less costly technologies than hydrogen and fuel cell cars . 
That view was embraced by the Obama administration , leading to some embarrassment this summer for new Energy Secretary Steven Chu , a Nobel Prize-winning physicist . 
Chu had ordered a $ 130 million cut in funding in 2010 for hydrogen and fuel cell transportation technology . 
But an outcry from groups ranging from the Union of Concerned Scientists , the National Research Council , fuel cell and hydrogen associations to the American Lung Association and car manufacturers , coupled with strong support in Congress , will probably lead to a reversal of the cuts . 
It is worth noting that hydrogen &apos;s supporters do not oppose battery powered cars , and they embrace biofuels as another renewable source of hydrogen . 
But because of the weight of electric batteries , their limited range , cost , and other considerations , batteries are best suited primarily for short-range city cars . 
In any case , hydrogen fuel cell cars typically incorporate batteries in hybrid configurations , enabling them to cover the 300-mile range demanded by consumers . 
Countless laboratories are working on better , cheaper hydrogen production and storage methods , and on ways to bring down costs and boost fuel cell durability . 
Both shortcomings remain major concerns . 
Moreover , a hydrogen fueling infrastructure must be built . 
This will be expensive , but probably not more so than maintaining the current fossil fuel structure , and will most likely start as station clusters or corridors in metropolitan areas that gradually spread outward . 
Cluster seeds are already underway in the Los Angeles and New York metropolitan areas and , very significantly , in Japan . 
Indeed , in Tokyo more than a dozen major Japanese energy companies are said to be banding together to push the creation of a national hydrogen fueling infrastructure by 2015 
The hydrogen revolution has started , but with a slow-burning fuse . 
Hydrogen is not the only weapon in the fight against global heating , but it is an essential element - in the truest sense of the word .
