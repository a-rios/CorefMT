Building on the Global Recovery 
The world is a study in contrasts nowadays . 
We are haunted by images of terror and warfare . 
Yet every region of the globe has experienced some of the strongest economic growth seen in years , inflation remains subdued despite surging oil prices , and financial markets are doing well . 
Several economies that recently faced financial crises are rebounding strongly . 
At the same time , much more needs to be done to help prevent future crises and reduce poverty . 
What do these contrasts mean for the future ? 
The answer depends crucially on how each country and the international community respond to key policy challenges : addressing global imbalances through macroeconomic policies and long-overdue reform ; meeting the costs of aging populations ; strengthening defenses against economic and financial crises ; and delivering on the pressing imperatives of poverty reduction . 
Recently , financial leaders from 184 countries met in Washington at the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank . 
This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the Bretton Woods Conference that established those two organizations as pillars of international economic cooperation . 
As IMF Managing Director , my message was one of vigilance and action . 
Simply put , the international community must take advantage of the current recovery to broaden efforts to ensure financial and economic stability , and help those countries with limited prospects . 
Periods of strong economic growth allow countries to put in place defenses to reduce the likelihood and severity of future downturns . 
But such opportunities are all too easy to squander . 
In an era of globalized financial markets , when countries can find it hard to cope with rapid cross-border capital flows , there is no time for complacency . 
A lesson of the 1990 &apos;s is that vulnerabilities must be dealt with before they become crises . 
The world &apos;s rapid economic growth in 2004 shows that the efforts to shore up our defenses since the 1990 &apos;s has paid off . 
But growth has been unbalanced : Europe and Japan - despite some recent gains - are far from reaching their potential , and the United States and China have continued largely to drive the world economy . 
One priority is to reduce global payments imbalances . 
The US must move to reduce its budget deficit in the medium-term . 
Europe and Japan can increase their growth by stepping up the pace of structural reform . 
Moves toward increased exchange rate flexibility in China and other Asian countries , supported by financial sector reform , will have domestic and global benefits . 
Emerging market countries elsewhere have made considerable reform progress of late , but they must sustain the momentum to guard against potential shocks . 
Other challenges loom . 
Issues that we once regarded as &quot; medium-term &quot; are becoming more urgent . 
Aging populations are forcing many countries to address pressures on their budgets and social security systems . 
The problem is imminent in North America , the Euro Area , and Japan . 
But , before long , many developing countries will also have to face up to it , and in many cases without a cushion of affluence . 
Then there is the energy issue . 
High oil prices have resurrected an old vulnerability . 
Countries need to reformulate their energy policies - including by boosting production and refining capacity , diversifying energy sources , and giving new impetus to conservation . 
A better balance between production and consumption would avoid large swings in oil prices . 
The IMF focuses on crisis prevention , and in the past decade encouraged greater transparency and stronger financial systems . 
The Fund also actively monitors capital market developments , and is implementing a more systematic assessment of debt sustainability . 
There will always be ways to strengthen our work so that we provide well-articulated advice based on a clear understanding and the best analysis of each country . 
We need to communicate our positions clearly to policymakers and reinforce incentives for countries to take appropriate corrective actions . 
But in the end , the effectiveness of our advice hinges on countries &apos; willingness to act on our recommendations . 
Poverty also threatens economic stability . 
For all the successes of recent decades , the fact remains that 20 % of the world &apos;s population still lives on less than $ 1 a day , while HIV / AIDS and other communicable diseases are ravaging many societies . 
Other social indicators offer a bleak picture . 
Indeed , most developing countries are likely to fall short of the international community &apos;s target of halving poverty by 2015 . 
In 2002 , at the Monterrey Conference , the international community agreed on a framework for reaching that goal . 
Developing countries would implement sound economic policies accompanied by good governance . 
Industrial countries would increase aid levels and lower trade barriers . 
The IMF and World Bank would offer advice , expertise , and financing , with the Fund concentrating on the macroeconomic and financial stability that is crucial to fostering durable growth and poverty reduction . 
Some progress has been made on this &quot; Monterrey Consensus . &quot; 
But international support is falling far below promised levels . 
Strong political commitments are needed to provide the aid that is needed to accelerate progress , and to secure success for the Doha trade round that is so crucial for developing countries &apos; longer-term prospects . 
The resilience of the global economy in the face of political and economic shocks demonstrates the central relevance of the reform process - and underlines the importance of continuing along this path . 
Governments and institutions like the IMF must keep this in mind as they seek to ensure a durable economic recovery that will benefit all of the world &apos;s people .
