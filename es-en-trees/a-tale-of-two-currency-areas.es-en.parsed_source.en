A Tale of Two Currency Areas 
PALO ALTO - The United States and Europe are two giant free-trade areas , each wealthy but with serious short-run problems and immense long-run challenges . 
They are also two single-currency areas : the dollar and , for much of Europe , the euro . 
The challenges facing both are monumental . 
But only Europe &apos;s currency union faces uncertainty about its future ; 
America faces no existential crisis for its currency . 
The two economic powers &quot; similarities and differences , particularly with respect to internal labor mobility , productivity , and fiscal policies , suggest why - and provide clues about whether the eurozone can weather the crises on its periphery and evolve into a stable single-currency area . 
Labor mobility from poorer to richer areas provides a shock absorber against differential economic hardship . 
The other natural shock absorber is a depreciating currency , which increases competitiveness in the area hit hardest . 
That cannot happen with a common currency , and economic adjustment is doubly difficult when labor is not mobile enough to help mitigate regional contractions in income and unemployment . 
The reasons for lower labor mobility in the eurozone than in America are legion . 
True , America &apos;s original thirteen colonies were a loose federation , and many Americans considered themselves citizens of their state first and of the US second as late as a century after the Revolution . 
But one &apos;s state was not a fully formed nation , with its own shared and deeply ingrained history , culture , ethnic identity , and religion . 
Perhaps the most important cultural component of labor mobility is language . 
From Mississippi to Maine , and from New York to New Orleans , America &apos;s written language is the same and the spoken language is understandable to all . 
Not so from Berlin to Barcelona or Rome to Rotterdam . 
( Or , for that matter , from northern to southern China or in multilingual India , where Hindi is spoken by only 42 % of the population . ) 
For eurozone citizens who do not speak a major language , especially English , mobility across national borders within the single-currency area is limited at best . 
These are differences that cannot be easily erased . 
While some aspects of culture are becoming globalized , variation across borders in Europe is far greater than it is between US states . 
For example , until the second half of the twentieth century , today &apos;s eurozone members regularly slaughtered each other on centuries of battlefields . 
By contrast , history is more commonly shared among Americans from different states , who , other than in the Civil War , have fought side by side in the nation &apos;s external wars . 
All of this means that when California slumps , residents simply leave for the mountain states ; when manufacturing jobs disappear in the upper Midwest , people migrate to new jobs in Texas . 
That pattern is much less prevalent in Europe . 
Moreover , it is a pattern that has closed the gap ( now roughly 40 % ) between per capita income in America &apos;s poorest and richest states , as labor and capital continually adjust by moving to areas where productivity is higher . 
The range of productivity and per capita income within the eurozone is considerably wider , making mobility even more important . 
Finally , while fiscal systems differ among American states , the overall fiscal burden is under half that of the federal level . 
Almost all states &quot; constitutions require balanced budgets ( with exceptions for emergencies ) . 
American states and municipalities do face serious medium- and long-term fiscal challenges from underfunded pension and health-care systems , but citizens living in different states have a common national budget , whereas citizens of different eurozone countries face radically different central-government fiscal positions . 
Indeed , many observers argue that the eurozone &apos;s lack of a common fiscal system is its main problem . 
But competition over taxes and services is beneficial , not harmful . 
Nevertheless , much tighter constraints , with serious and enforceable penalties , must be placed on permissible budget positions and their transparency if the euro is to survive . 
And it can survive . 
Those who would write off the euro as a failure should consider that it is only ten years old . 
America , too , historically had problems as a single-currency area , from early chaos before the Constitution to the clash between agricultural and banking interests over the gold standard in the late nineteenth century . 
While the euro faces strong headwinds , the dollar &apos;s early sailing wasn &apos;t always smooth , either . 
The eurozone countries must first deal with the sovereign-debt crisis , reduce their fiscal deficits , and strengthen the woefully undercapitalized banking system . 
But , if the eurozone is to survive and prosper beyond the current crisis , it will also need comprehensive structural reforms to boost internal labor mobility and defuse the pressures caused by economic adjustment among nations and regions . 
Whether citizens will support politicians who propose the labor , tax , and other reforms needed to enhance mobility , and whether such reforms will be sufficient to overcome linguistic and cultural barriers , are open questions . 
Successive generations of post-war European political leaders initiated the European Union and then currency union in order to knit countries so closely together that another major war between them would become impossible . 
Whether monetary union was necessary to accomplish that aim is debatable . 
Despite the considerable advantages of a common currency ( price transparency , lower transaction costs , and inflation credibility , to name a few ) , the difficulty of macroeconomic management of such diverse economies looms larger than ever . 
The euro was always a big gamble , a grand experiment . 
Historical efforts at monetary union have sometimes collapsed , and sometimes they have survived multiple crises . 
The future of the eurozone may be cloudy , but it will not be dull .
