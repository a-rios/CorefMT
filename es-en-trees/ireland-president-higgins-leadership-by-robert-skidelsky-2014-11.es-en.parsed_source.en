Philosopher Kings Versus Philosopher Presidents 
LONDON - When I recently met Irish President Michael Higgins - sharing a platform for a speech in which he connected his newly launched &quot; ethics initiative &quot; to a book I co-wrote with my son , How Much is Enough ? 
Money and the Good Life - I was struck by his devotion to thought . 
Indeed , engaging with ideas is a passion for Ireland &apos;s poet-president - one that more heads of states should take up . 
Last May , Higgins told economics students at the University of Chicago that they were studying a deformed discipline , torn from its ethical and philosophical roots . 
&quot; The recent economic and financial upheavals , &quot; he declared , &quot; have thrown a glaring light on the shortcomings of the intellectual tools provided by mainstream economics and its key assumptions regarding the sustainability of self-regulating markets , &quot; especially &quot; largely unregulated global financial markets . &quot; 
He then proposed a &quot; critical examination of some of the core assumptions that underpin economics as it is currently taught in university departments across the world . &quot; 
What other head of state would be able to pinpoint the deficiencies of economics so accurately , buttressing his arguments with quotations not just from Adam Smith , but also from Max Weber , Thorstein Veblen , and JÃ¼rgen Habermas ? 
Higgins &quot; experience as an academic and his status as an acclaimed poet undoubtedly give him an advantage over other heads of state , enabling him to hold his own with top thinkers in a way that few others can . 
More important , however , is his recognition that a political leader should also be a leader of thought and culture for his or her country - and the world . 
Such intellectual leadership should be a major function of all titular ( non-executive ) heads of state , an important way for them to &quot; earn their keep . &quot; 
Of course , the head of state - whether the president or the monarch - has other critical duties as well , including acting as guarantor of the constitution and a symbol of national unity . 
Moreover , in proportional voting systems like Italy &apos;s , where no single political party normally wins a majority of seats in parliament , the president often plays a key role in appointing the prime minister . 
The Italian president can also compel parliamentary deputies to rethink their decisions ( in the United Kingdom , the monarch has outsourced this authority to the House of Lords ) . 
But there is also considerable scope for heads of state to behave in accordance with Ecclesiasticus 44 : 4 : &quot; Leaders of the people by their counsels , and by their knowledge of learning meet for the people , wise and eloquent are their instructions . &quot; 
This is particularly important today , when public discourse in democracies is relentlessly demotic and academic work is increasingly specialized . Though some scholars and thinkers are fit to be &quot; leaders of the people , &quot; a favorable environment is needed to coax them out of their ivory towers . 
To this end , an open-minded , culturally literate , and ideas-oriented head of state could play a pivotal role . 
Ideally , that head of state would be an elected president , rather than a hereditary monarch . 
Indeed , anything worthwhile that a monarch can do , an elected non-executive president can do better - not least because an elected official is much less likely to be undermined by the scandals of pampered offspring or degraded by the inevitable hypocrisy and servility of a royal court . 
More important , an elected president has much greater legitimacy than a hereditary monarch , whose claim to authority depends exclusively on tradition and ceremony . 
With a king or queen unable to say or do anything that may cause a whiff of controversy , the monarchy has been stripped of its power of action or reflection . 
To be sure , monarchs - and especially their spouses , heirs , and relations - often carve out niches for themselves , from wildlife protection to sports and charities . 
( Architecture has proved distinctly risky , as Prince Charles learned after launching jeremiads against modernism . ) 
Monarchs and their courts can , to some extent , still act as leaders of art , music , and fashion , as they did in the eighteenth century . 
But this role has atrophied with the rising expectation that they should be &quot; normal , &quot; representing their populations &quot; habits and tastes as closely as possible . 
An elected president has a stronger mandate to be controversial , especially in areas of thought and culture that lie beyond the domain of quotidian politics but shape the quality of the public space in which politics plays out . 
It would be inconceivable for a reigning monarch to attack the financial oligarchy , as Higgins did in his speech in Chicago . 
Even in 1936 , when King Edward VIII of Britain declared that &quot; something must be done &quot; about unemployment , he was criticized for overstepping his brief . 
Yet , in May , Higgins declared that his position as head of state compelled him &quot; to represent the experience and hardships of the Irish people &quot; in the years since economic crisis befell them . 
But the most important reason why an elected president is better equipped than a monarch to catalyze a public conversation about a society &apos;s values and priorities is that he or she is more likely to be a person of superior ability . 
Indeed , that is why , on balance , a meritocratic system will always produce better results than a hereditary one . 
Monarchs today are reared to be ordinary , as suits their diminished role in national life .
