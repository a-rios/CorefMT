The Politics of Moral Hazard 
BRUSSELS - It is an old and never-ending contest . 
On one side are the moral-hazard scolds , claiming that one of the major responsibilities confronting policymakers is to establish incentives that demonstrate that imprudent behavior does not pay . 
On the other side are the partisans of financial stability , for whom confidence in the financial system is too precious to be endangered , even with the best possible intentions . 
Cyprus is the latest battleground between the two camps . 
On March 25 , after the decision had been taken to wind up the country &apos;s second-largest bank , and to impose large losses on uninsured depositors in the process , Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem , the Dutch finance minister , declared that a healthy financial sector requires that &quot; where you take on the risks , you must deal with them . &quot; 
The aim , he added , should be to create an environment in which Europe &apos;s finance ministers &quot; never need to consider a direct recapitalization &quot; of a bank by the European Stability Mechanism . 
He was apparently reading from a textbook on moral hazard . 
Immediately after this declaration , however , prices of European bank stocks plunged , and Dijsselbloem was accused by many ( including some of his colleagues ) of having poured oil on a burning fire . 
Within hours , he issued a statement indicating that &quot; Cyprus is a specific case with exceptional challenges , &quot; and that &quot; no templates are used &quot; in the approach to the European crisis . 
This is not convincing . 
Markets learn from a current crisis which principles will be applied in the next one . 
And letting them learn is precisely what the fight against moral hazard is about . 
European policymakers have been agonizing over the same dilemma throughout the Cyprus crisis . 
The burden of bailing out the country &apos;s ailing financial institutions was too heavy for an already-indebted Cypriot state , and the International Monetary Fund was adamant that it would not pretend otherwise . 
So , in mid-March , Cyprus was heading for a precipitous retrenchment of its banking system , resulting in the loss of a very large part of the country &apos;s financial wealth . 
For the IMF and Germany , which pushed for such an outcome , the rationale was the need to prevent moral hazard . 
Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades , reportedly with some support from European institutions , desperately tried to avoid this fate - in the name of financial stability . 
The solution found during the night of March 15 - a one-time tax on deposits - was defensible from the Cypriot viewpoint . 
Preserving domestic financial stability required limiting taxation of large deposits , because a substantial proportion belonged to foreign account-holders . 
Avoiding a massive withdrawal of foreign capital therefore implied taxing all deposits below the € 100,000 ( $ 130,000 ) threshold . 
Absent a foreign bailout , no other solution was on offer . 
But this solution was detrimental to financial stability in the rest of Europe , because it signaled that the € 100,000 threshold below which deposits are guaranteed was not sacrosanct . 
Legally , of course , this guarantee is only worth the solvency of the guarantor - in this case the near-bankrupt Cypriot state . 
But its abrogation would nonetheless be symbolically powerful , sparking anxiety throughout Europe . 
The obvious way out of this dilemma would have been for Cyprus &apos;s eurozone partners to assume the cost of the tax on deposits below € 100,000 . 
Doing so would have cost them an estimated € 1.3 billion , or roughly 0.01 % of their GDP - a ridiculously low price to pay for financial stability . 
It would not have created much moral hazard : large depositors would have been taxed , and the Cypriot government would still have suffered the strictures of an IMF / eurozone program - bitter enough medicine . 
But , at a time when northern European citizens are full of resentment against banks and seething with anger over transfers to the south , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her peers did not want to ask their taxpayers to pay for a partner country &apos;s mistakes . 
The March 15 agreement was not politically viable , and was overwhelmingly rejected by the Cypriot parliament . 
So , ten days after the ill-fated solution was proposed , the Eurogroup ministers changed course and adopted the approach that they had tried to avoid . 
Banks are being precipitously resolved . 
The consequences are already visible : to avoid a complete meltdown , Cyprus has been forced to introduce capital controls - which everyone had thought were illegal and unthinkable within the eurozone . 
As a result , investors and depositors have learned that the erection of financial barriers within the currency area is indeed a genuine risk . 
And the Cypriots are so angry at Europe that a deliberate exit from the eurozone has become a distinct possibility . 
Ultimately , the true contest is less between moral hazard and financial stability than it is between financially sensible and politically acceptable solutions . 
In Europe , as elsewhere , financial policy used to be the remit of specialists - central bankers , regulators , and supervisors . 
Not anymore : the experts have lost their legitimacy . 
Nowadays , angry citizens are in charge , and politics is driving financial policy . 
But politics in Europe is national , and what one national parliament regards as the only possible solution another national parliament regards as entirely unacceptable . 
Europe has not yet found a response to this problem , and it is not on the way to finding one .
