Europe &apos;s Economic War of Attrition 
NEWPORT BEACH - I was nine years old when Egypt entered what became known as its &quot; war of attrition &quot; with Israel . 
During this period of &quot; no war and no peace , &quot; underlying tensions festered , and a fragile tranquility was periodically interrupted by armed skirmishes . 
The war of attrition followed the June 1967 war , in which Egypt - to the immense surprise of most of its citizens and the outside world - was soundly defeated . 
Its air force was crippled and its army was virtually overrun , with Israel capturing the entire Sinai Peninsula . 
Positioned on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal , Israel &apos;s army was just over 100 kilometers from Cairo . 
The official narrative reflected little of this . 
Whether on state television or in government-controlled newspapers - at the time , there was no free press , Internet , or cable news - citizens were reassured that Egypt had regained control of its destiny . 
To this day , I remember vividly the sense of general anxiety that prevailed among citizens , accentuated by deep concern about what the future might hold . 
People were afraid to invest , and many wondered whether they should emigrate in search of a better future . 
With the underlying issues left unaddressed , the war of attrition was followed by another full-scale war in 1973 - one that again surprised most people inside and outside Egypt . 
This time , the Egyptian armed forces won a number of early battles and secured a cease-fire that regained part of the Sinai , setting the stage for the 1979 peace agreement with Israel . 
I recount this history not to draw a parallel with today &apos;s Israeli-Palestinian conflict , which , just a couple of weeks ago , resulted in many civilian deaths , overwhelmingly in Gaza . 
European citizens - particularly in peripheral economies such as Greece , Portugal , and Spain - are anxious . 
Unemployment is unacceptably high , and is still rising . 
Their economies continue to implode , leading to cumulative contractions that are setting tragic new records . 
Poverty is on the rise . 
Not surprisingly , increased emigration to the stronger eurozone countries ( such as Germany ) has been accompanied by higher outflows of financial capital . 
Admittedly , and fortunately , the parallels are far from perfect . 
Europe does not have armed conflicts . 
Feelings of intense insecurity are not related to bombs and sirens . 
The threat is economic rather than military . 
Yet there is a real sense of &quot; no peace and no war . &quot; 
Europe &apos;s economic peace remains elusive for a simple reason : governments have still not found a way to generate the trifecta of growth , employment , and financial stability . 
The longer this prevails , the more oxygen is sucked out of sectors that remain relatively healthy - and for three distinct reasons . 
First , the eurozone economy is extremely interconnected . 
As such , it is only a matter of time until weakness in one part migrates to other parts . 
After a period of record low unemployment , economic growth has slowed markedly , reaching just 0.2 % in quarterly terms in July-September . 
On current trends , the fourth quarter &apos;s growth rate will turn negative . 
Second , the eurozone &apos;s bailout bill continues to rise . 
Cyprus is expected to join the other three &quot; program countries &quot; ( Greece , Ireland , and Portugal ) in requiring considerable official financing ; and , of the other three , only Ireland is getting close to regaining normal access to capital markets . 
With Spain also requiring billions more to recapitalize its banks , the contingent claims on taxpayers in the core countries continue to mount . 
Indeed , this is one of the factors that contributed to Moody &apos;s decision - following Standard 
Poor &apos;s - to strip France of its AAA credit rating . 
Finally , adverse contagion is extending beyond the 17 countries in the eurozone . 
The region &apos;s debt crisis is undermining cooperation within the larger 27-member European Union , resulting in the spectacular failure of the recent summit on the EU budget . 
It has also contributed to the economic slowdown in China , raising concerns ( which I believe are exaggerated ) that the country &apos;s new leadership may have problems engineering a soft landing for an economy accustomed to double-digit ( or high single-digit ) growth . 
This lack of peace would have resulted in outright economic and financial war if not for the critical - and growing - role played by the European Central Bank . 
Under the bold leadership of Mario Draghi , the ECB has committed to provide as much time as possible for most governments to get their acts together . 
Yet it would be a grave mistake to assume that the ECB can deliver lasting economic peace . 
It cannot . 
If governments continue to dither and bicker , the most that it can do is delay the war for a while . 
Like Egypt &apos;s war of attrition , the eurozone &apos;s underlying economic , financial , and social ferment continues . 
If governments continue to stumble from one patchwork remedy to another - a probability that remains uncomfortably high - the delay in implementing a comprehensive solution will eventually overwhelm the defenses that the ECB has so courageously put in place . 
Some say that , just as Egypt &apos;s war of attrition eventually gave way to a full-scale war and then a peace treaty , Europe needs a major crisis to move forward . 
European governments are well advised to use the financial cease-fire that the ECB is willing to buy for them . 
Allowing it to expire without progress toward permanent stability would expose Europe to disruptions that would diminish significantly its prospects for long-term economic stability , growth and job creation .
