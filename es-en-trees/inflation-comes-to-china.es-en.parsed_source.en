Inflation Comes to China 
SHANGHAI - Macroeconomic conditions in any country are like running water . 
How large and fast is the flow ? 
Where does it originate and where does it go ? 
The &quot; main stream &quot; of China &apos;s economy is the vast flow of inward investment . 
China &apos;s economy is prone to rapid growth , with buoyant investment demand sustaining powerful short-term inflationary pressures . 
As a result , credit controls on investment projects and a close watch on the money supply have been used to promote macroeconomic stability since China began its market reforms . 
But in 2003 , following five years of deflation , China &apos;s economy entered a new phase . 
Overcapacity vanished , constraints on consumption were lifted , and a dramatic increase in household demand followed . 
Since then , heavy industries - steel , automobiles , machinery , building materials , energy , and raw materials - have experienced an unprecedented investment boom , reflecting demand for urban construction , housing , transport , infrastructure , and equipment renewal . 
Not surprisingly , the economy began to overheat . 
Productivity and profitability in manufacturing and heavy industries picked up , boosting China &apos;s national savings dramatically . 
Indeed , the huge increase in China &apos;s trade surplus in recent years is a consequence not of the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate , as many believe , but of the domestic savings &quot; increase . 
Yet , from 2005 to early 2007 , macroeconomic policy was focused on reining in the surplus . 
Most importantly , the renminbi was allowed to appreciate , and the export tax rebate was virtually eliminated . 
In early 2007 , because inflation was not really visible , the government did not regard it as a major problem . 
But when price increases accelerated in the second half of the year , the authorities began to worry . 
The central bank ( PBOC ) initially attributed it to excess liquidity , and so began to use monetary policy tools , raising interest rates five times since late 2007 . 
As a result , the interest rate for 12-month fixed deposits has reached 3.9 % . 
Moreover , the PBOC has issued Central Bank Notes six times , reinforcing its anti-inflationary effort . 
Nevertheless , by the end of October , M2 money supply had increased by 18.4 % - growing by 1.3 % faster year on year , and exceeding the 16 % target . 
By the start of 2008 , it was clear that controlling inflation and cooling an overheating economy had become the government &apos;s main economic target . 
Indeed , the government &apos;s key economic committee , the Central Work Committee , has concluded that after years of &quot; high growth and low inflation , &quot; China is on a route to &quot; high growth with high inflation . &quot; 
This invariably means that fiscal and monetary stability will become a priority while controlling the trade surplus has become a lower one . 
The problem is that , until now , the major cause of inflation has been rapidly rising manufacturing costs , and there is no sign of a slowdown in energy and raw material prices . 
Moreover , a new labor law and income policies will further increase workforce costs . 
And , due to rising consumer prices , the nominal interest rate will continue to rise . 
As a result , with investment demand remaining robust , inflation could spread . 
In the face of growing inflation , output is set to suffer . 
In order to curb investment demand , tighter credit rationing and monetary policy are inevitable in 2008 , while investment projects and land use will be subject to more rigorous control . 
Likewise , increasing pressure from growing labor costs will force enterprises to lower their profit expectations and cut costs , negatively affecting output growth and employment in the short run . 
It will be difficult to ease these inflationary pressures this year . 
International commodity prices will continue to rise , increases in domestic labor costs and prices of non-tradable goods cannot easily be stemmed , the international economic situation will encourage further capital inflows , and asset inflation will persist . 
All these factors will push inflation above the 2007 level . 
With export performance also set to slow , owing to the economic downturn in the United States , employment and growth could be weakened further , which implies mounting pressure on China &apos;s government - and thus on the fiscal deficit , creating another source of inflationary pressure . 
And , once an inflationary trend emerges and economic growth slows , the steady- as-you go pattern to China &apos;s decade-long boom will be over .
