Between Pax Americana and Pax Africana 
War and peace exist in Africa for reasons that are not always internal to Africa . 
Conflicts in other parts of the world often have huge repercussions across Africa . 
Four times as many Kenyans as Israelis died in November 2002 in the terrorist attack on the Paradise , an Israeli hotel in my hometown of Mombasa . 
Was this but another moment of blood-stained convergence between the politics of the Middle East and the politics of Islam in Africa ? 
Here we must distinguish between national and international terrorism . 
Much of the terrorism in Africa in the second half of the 20 th century targeted the colonial powers and the European minority regimes that were their legacy . 
Kenya , for example , won its independence partly in an anti-colonial war of liberation in which both the British colonial forces and the Mau Mau movement resorted to terrorism . 
In retrospect , &quot; national &quot; terrorism in Africa was a form of warfare that must be judged within its political and moral context , and by its ultimate results . 
Kenya &apos;s Mau Mau war delivered independence in 1963 ; the Algerian revolution liberated that country in 1962 ; anti-colonial wars in Angola , Mozambique , and Guinea-Bissau destroyed the Portuguese empire in 1974 ; the anti-UDI struggle in Rhodesia ( Zimbabwe ) ended white rule ; and the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa finally triumphed against the apartheid racial order . 
Unlike anti-European guerilla war and anti-colonial terrorism in Africa , anti-American and anti-Zionist terrorism in the Middle East has led nowhere . 
Yet its brutality has often caught Africa in the crossfire . 
In order to kill twelve Americans in an attack on the US Embassy in August 1998 , Middle Eastern terrorists killed some two hundred Kenyans in Nairobi . 
Far more Tanzanians than Americans were killed and wounded when the US Embassy in Dar es Salaam was targeted at the same time . 
Sudan bore the brunt of US retaliation , when President Bill Clinton ordered the bombing of an apparently harmless pharmaceutical factory near Khartoum as retaliation for an Osama bin Laden sponsored terrorist attack . 
Indeed , violence between Americans and Middle Easterners has been spilling over into Africa for decades . 
Before Clinton , President Ronald Reagan ordered the bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in Libya in 1986 in retaliation for the bombing of a German disco in which several Americans were killed . 
Similarly , many Africans were killed at the World Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 - Senegalese hawkers , Nigerian investors , Ethiopian or Eritrean drivers , Ghanaian students , Egyptian and South African tourists , and others . 
Security forces throughout the continent subsequently opened their doors to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence Agency . 
At that moment , Pax Americana entered Africa , forging an alliance with the governments and people long struggling to establish a Pax Africana . 
The FBI reportedly arrived in Tanzania with the names of 60 Muslims selected for interrogation . 
The Kenyan authorities , eager to please the US , were tempted to hand over Kenyan citizens on the slightest encouragement . 
The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of September , 2001 and their aftermath may exacerbate tensions not only between pro-Western and anti-Western schools of thought in Africa , but also between Christians and Muslims . 
A demonstration by Nigerian Muslims in Kano against the US war in Afghanistan provoked stone throwing by Nigerian Christians . 
Churches and mosques were soon being burned in communal riots . 
The pressure on African governments to enact legislation against terrorism may pose new threats to civil liberties at the very moment when democratization is gathering momentum . 
In the war on terror , it seems , Africa &apos;s dictators may find it easier to justify continuing tyranny . 
Because the thousand-year-old city of Mombasa historically had a superb natural harbor , it was fought over many times - by Arabs , the Portuguese , Zanzibaris , the Mazrui , the British , and others . 
There was a time when it was called &quot; Mvita , &quot; the Isle of War . 
Even now , the Swahili dialect of Mombasa is called Ki-mvita , and its people coined the proverb &quot; Ndovu wawili wakipigana , ziumiazo na nyasi &quot; &#91; When two elephants fight , it is the grass that suffers &#93; . 
Since the attack on the Paradise hotel , Mombasa has not reverted to its ancient identity of Mvita , the Isle of War , because only a single elephant , the US , with its protégé , Israel , exists . 
But when even a lone elephant does a war dance , the grass still feels the pain . 
Mombasa &apos;s anguish , economic as well as in terms of security , may have only just begun . 
Speedy action is needed to restore the sense of dignity of Coastal and Muslim Kenyans before Kenyan Islam is radicalized into a Black Intifada . 
Even speedier action is needed to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , both for its own sake , and because its repercussions destabilize other parts of the world . 
But will American resources help to strengthen Pax Africana , or will American power simply turn it into a handmaiden of Pax Americana ? 
How can we avoid the Americanization of Pax Africana ? 
One solution is for the African states to evolve a common position and shared rules of engagement in the war on terrorism . 
Ideally , the US should deal with a South Atlantic Treaty Organization , consisting of African states that are allied against terrorism , rather than cutting bilateral deals with individual African countries . 
Above all , if Africa is to escape the crossfire of international terrorism , the trend towards establishing US military bases on the continent must be stopped .
