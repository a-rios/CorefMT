Fiscal Follies 
NEW YORK - The fiscal stimulus that most advanced economies and emerging markets implemented during the 2008-2009 global recession - together with monetary easing and the backstopping of the financial system - prevented the Great Recession from turning into another Great Depression in 2010 . 
At a time when every component of private demand was collapsing , the boost from higher government spending and lower taxes stopped the global economy &apos;s free-fall and created the basis for recovery . 
Unfortunately , stimulus spending and the related bailout of the financial system , together with the recession &apos;s effect on revenues , contributed to fiscal deficits on the order of 10 % of GDP in most advanced economies . 
According to the International Monetary Fund and others , these economies &quot; ratio of public debt to GDP will surpass 110 % by 2015 , compared to 70 % before the crisis . 
Aging populations in most advanced economies imply additional public debt in the long term , owing to non-fully-funded pension schemes and rising health-care costs . 
Thus , in most advanced economies , deficits need to be reduced to avoid a fiscal train wreck down the line . 
But much research , including a recent study by the IMF , suggests that raising taxes and reducing government spending has a negative short-term effect on aggregate demand , thereby reinforcing deflationary and recessionary trends - and undermining fiscal consolidation . 
In an ideal world , where policymakers could credibly commit to medium- to long-term fiscal adjustment , the optimal and desirable path would be to commit today to a schedule of spending reductions and tax increases , phased in gradually over the next decade as the economy recovers . 
That way , if the economy needed another targeted fiscal stimulus in the short run , financial markets would not respond by driving up borrowing costs . 
Unfortunately , the fiscal policy currently adopted by various advanced economies deviates sharply from this path of credible medium-term consolidation combined with short-term additional stimulus . 
In the US , we have the worst of all possible worlds . 
On one hand , stimulus had become a dirty word - even within the Obama administration - well before the Republicans &quot; mid-term election victory ruled out another round altogether . 
On the other hand , medium-term consolidation will be all but impossible in America &apos;s current atmosphere of hyper-partisanship , with Republicans blocking any tax increase and Democrats resisting reforms of entitlement spending . 
Nor is there any pressure from bond markets to concentrate the minds of policymakers . 
In the periphery of the eurozone , the problem is the opposite : bond vigilantes are demanding that Greece , Ireland , Portugal , Spain , and Italy front-load fiscal consolidation or watch their borrowing costs go through the roof , risking them their market access and triggering a public-debt crisis . 
Markets don &apos;t care that front-loaded fiscal consolidation is exacerbating recession and thus making the goal of reducing debt and deficits as a share of GDP near-impossible to achieve . 
To avoid a persistent and destructive recession , the fiscal and structural reforms imposed by the bond vigilantes should be accompanied by other euro-zone policies that restore growth and prevent vicious debt dynamics . 
The European Central Bank should ease monetary policy in order to weaken the value of the euro and bootstrap the periphery &apos;s growth . 
And Germany should cut taxes temporarily - rather than raising taxes , as planned - in order to increase disposable income and stimulate German demand for the periphery &apos;s goods and services . 
Alas , neither of the two biggest players in the euro zone is pursuing policies consistent with restoring sustained growth in the euro zone &apos;s periphery . 
The ECB &apos;s monetary policy is too tight ; and Germany is front-loading fiscal austerity . 
Thus , the periphery is destined to a destructive deflationary and recessionary adjustment that will exacerbate the risks of recession , insolvency , eventual defaults and , possibly , exit from the euro . 
In the United Kingdom , the new government gave several reasons for front-loading fiscal consolidation . 
The bond vigilantes might have woken up if early austerity was not implemented ; the deficit was very large and the public sector bloated ; and it is always politically easier to implement tough measures early in an administration , when popular support is still high and the next election is far off . 
Certainly , the UK was playing with fiscal fire and needed some commitment to earlier austerity . 
But phasing in austerity more gradually , and thus back-loading the adjustment , would have posed less risk to the economy &apos;s anemic recovery while maintaining a credible commitment to fiscal consolidation . 
Instead , the government could well end up with no plan B in case plan A - massively front-loaded austerity - leads to a double-dip recession . 
In short , an optimal path of fiscal austerity would , in most countries , imply a back-loaded but credible commitment to medium-term consolidation , together with short-term additional stimulus when necessary and allowed by market conditions , thereby avoiding the prospect of a deflationary and recessionary spiral . 
Unfortunately , the main advanced economies are following a divergent path - which , in some cases , will lead them in the opposite direction in 2011 . 
As a result , the risks of debt deflation and eventual disorderly sovereign and private-sector defaults are rising .
