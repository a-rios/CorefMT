Globalizing the Security Council 
BRASILIA - The 1945 United Nations Charter represented a historic breakthrough in the pursuit of peace on a multilateral basis . 
At the end of a global war that claimed more than 50 million lives , the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the world &apos;s two major powers . 
The UN Charter , initially negotiated by the US , the Soviet Union , and the United Kingdom during World War II , established a Security Council containing five permanent members , including France and the Republic of China . 
At its inception , the UN brought together 51 countries ; it now has 193 member states . 
But , although the Security Council was enlarged in 1965 by increasing the number of non-permanent seats from six to ten , its permanent members have not changed since 1945 . 
The world has gone through extraordinary transformations since then . 
In addition to interstate conflict and the proliferation of weapons - particularly weapons of mass destruction - new challenges have emerged , such as terrorism and the involvement of non-state actors in internal conflicts . 
Meanwhile , the global distribution of economic and political power has undergone a radical reconfiguration , setting the stage for the emergence of a multipolar international order . 
In this environment , the Security Council &apos;s frozen composition is imposing significant limits on the international community &apos;s capacity to address global challenges . 
Conflicts drag on without proper action from the body created to resolve them . 
Thousands of civilians die , are displaced , or are subjected to appalling human-rights abuses , while the Security Council proves unable or unwilling to act . 
Reform of the Council is thus urgent and indispensable . 
A majority of UN member states are in favor of creating a new Council with an expanded roster of both permanent and non-permanent members . 
This majority reflects a growing perception that the world would be more stable and more secure with a strengthened and updated multilateral system . 
That means adding new voices to reflect the world in which we now live . 
Only then will the Security Council have the legitimacy to act on today &apos;s manifold conflicts . 
A reformed Security Council would reflect the emergence of new powers and their readiness to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security . 
In the financial and economic arena , this new multipolarity has already led to quota reforms at the International Monetary Fund and resulted in the consolidation of the G-20 as the premier venue for multilateral economic-policy coordination . 
The contrast with matters of peace and security is stark . 
Entire regions of the world , such as Africa and Latin America , are excluded from the nucleus of decision-making . 
A governing body that is not representative fuels uncertainty and frustration among those subject to its decisions , undermining the legitimacy - and thus the effectiveness - of its actions . 
The greatest risk that we run is erosion of the Security Council &apos;s credibility , and , with it , a diminishing capacity to confront grave threats to peace . 
We all stand to lose if new international crises end up being addressed by coalitions of countries at the margins of the Security Council and in a manner that flouts international law . 
The lessons of the recent past are clear . 
In any conflict , neighboring countries &quot; participation and commitment are indispensable to the achievement of peace . 
Only an expanded Security Council can enable effective conflict resolution worldwide . 
The international community cannot afford to postpone reform . 
It is our duty to preserve the multilateral system of peace and security - an achievement of the international community that , despite its shortcomings , has helped save the planet from another war on a global scale . 
Only an increase in the number of permanent and non-permanent seats can remedy the representation deficit within the Security Council and adapt it to the realities of the twenty-first century . 
If new members and regions are not offered a seat at the table , the Council will face increasing irrelevance - and the world , more than ever in need of effective conflict resolution , will be far worse off .
