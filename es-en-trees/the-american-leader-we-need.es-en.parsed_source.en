The American Leader We Need 
LONDON - Around the world , America &apos;s presidential election campaign has attracted as much attention as domestic political controversies in each of our own countries . 
The interest the world has taken in America &apos;s vote is the best example of America &apos;s soft power , and a lesson in democracy from the world &apos;s only superpower . 
If only we could all vote as well as watch and listen , because the outcome is vital for everyone around the world . 
What does the world want - and , perhaps more importantly , what does it need - from a new American President ? 
Much as some may hate to admit it , anti-Americanism is a sentiment that has been fed and nurtured during the Bush years . 
Yet the world still needs American leadership . 
Yes , we are witnessing the emergence of China , Brazil , and India as important global economic players . 
Yes , we have watched the humiliating fall of Wall Street &apos;s masters of the universe . 
Yes , American military prowess has drained away into what Winston Churchill called &quot; the thankless deserts of Mesopotamia , &quot; and its moral authority has been weakened by events in places from Guant√°namo Bay to Abu Ghraib . 
All that is true . 
Yet the United States remains the world &apos;s only superpower , the only nation that matters in every part of the globe , the only country capable of mobilizing international action to tackle global problems . 
A new president &apos;s first task will be to return America &apos;s economic competitiveness and self-confidence . 
It will not be easy to rein in over-spending and over-borrowing , to restore the real family values of saving , thrift , responsibility , and fair reward . 
Achieving these goals is bound to involve a greater regard for social equality , after a period in which the very rich have been able to protect a &quot; Roaring Twenties &quot; lifestyle through cleverly exploiting the &quot; culture wars &quot; - i.e. , the populist prejudices of their much poorer fellow citizens . 
With America turning away from its global role of borrower of last resort , the rest of us will need to sharpen our competitive edge to sell in other markets . 
What is imperative is that this should not be impeded by a return to protectionism . 
A new American president would do well to remember the disastrous consequences of protectionism in the 1920 &quot; s and 1930 &quot; s . 
President Herbert Hoover &apos;s failures should be a sanguinary lesson . 
We all look to the next US president to re-engage with the world community and international organizations , accepting that even a superpower should accept the rules that apply to others . 
The United Nations is far from perfect . 
It needs reform - as do the bodies that provide global economic governance . 
That will take time . 
But a necessary if not sufficient condition for change is America &apos;s commitment to and leadership of the process . 
Forget the distraction of trying to create an alternative to the UN - the so-called &quot; League of Democracies . &quot; 
It won &apos;t work . 
We want a new president who will aim to make a success of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Renewal Conference in 2010 by scrapping more weapons , abandoning research into them , and challenging others to do the same . 
That would be the best backdrop to establishing tougher surveillance and monitoring , beginning to engage with Iran , and searching for a way to involve India and Pakistan in a global nuclear agreement . 
Ahead of that , a new president should unleash America &apos;s creative potential in boosting energy efficiency and developing clean technologies . 
It would be a welcome surprise if a comprehensive follow-up to the Kyoto Treaty could be agreed next year . 
But at least we should aim to agree on the process that will move world-wide discussions in the right direction and , as part of that , America should aim to engage Europe , China , and India , in particular , on technological developments like clean coal . 
America &apos;s relationship with China will be a key to prosperity and security in this new century . 
I do not think that a struggle for hegemony is inevitable , or that it would be desirable . 
The US should focus more attention on China , without ever pretending that China &apos;s record on human rights can be swept under the carpet . 
China cannot sustain its economic development without political changes and environmental improvements . 
In the Middle East , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered wise advice to the next US president upon his retirement . 
Israel and Palestine have become , he said , the hopeless and bloody prism through which American diplomacy often seems to see the world . 
It has long since been time to move on , making a sustained drive for the sort of settlement that was almost achieved in the Clinton years . 
There is s paradox in all this . 
The world has for years called for a multilateral approach from Washington . 
When we get one , will the rest of us - Europe , for example - actually respond with sufficient commitment and drive ? 
It would at least be a welcome challenge to be required to put our efforts where our mouths have been .
