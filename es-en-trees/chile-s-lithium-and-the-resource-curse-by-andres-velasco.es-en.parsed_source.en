The Natural-Resource Curse Strikes Again 
SANTIAGO - Chile today produces one-third of the world &apos;s lithium - used in batteries that power everything from computers to cars - and has great potential to expand that share . 
But , while everyone agrees that Chile should realize its potential as a global supplier of lithium , the local debate on how to accomplish this has produced more heat than light . 
President Sebastián Piñera &apos;s government has attempted to auction off the right to expand lithium production to up to 100,000 tons over the next 20 years . 
But , as is often the case with natural-resource exploitation in developing countries - though not necessarily in Chile - the process has turned into a tragicomedy of errors , impeding the country &apos;s development . 
There are lessons in this experience for other natural-resource exporters . 
Piñera &apos;s center-right administration has been rigidly ideological in its approach . 
Its University of Chicago-trained economists argue that attracting private investment into primary lithium production is all that matters , and that fostering local industries that rely on lithium as an input is not a public-policy goal . 
So the government held an auction in which domestic vertical integration and value added were not relevant criteria for awarding production rights . 
Nor were the auction &apos;s designers concerned about fostering domestic competition . 
And , because the government chose not to go to Congress for a law authorizing the auction , investors feared that the legal framework was open to challenge . 
As a result , only three firms submitted tenders , and the initial winner was SQM , one of the two firms already engaged in lithium production in Chile . 
The auction was marred by potential conflicts of interest . 
The mining minister had to take himself out of the process because his brother is a senior manager at SQM , which is controlled by the former son-in-law of the late dictator General Augusto Pinochet . 
The company has a controversial past , faces a pending dispute with tax authorities , and is a party to several court cases involving the Chilean government . 
In the end , these cases disqualified SQM and caused the auction result to be nullified . 
This is a good opportunity for a fundamental rethink . 
Chile &apos;s constitution leaves no room for doubt that lithium belongs to the state , so the state will necessarily be a key player in the development of the lithium industry . 
But no Chilean government-owned company has experience in primary lithium production , or in any of the industrial uses of lithium . 
So the time is ripe for Chile to do with lithium what it has never done before with its other mineral riches : develop a comprehensive policy aimed at building a local value-added industry . 
To achieve that goal , the Chilean state will need strategic partners , which may turn out to be foreign or domestic . 
And the process for selecting those partners should have the proper regulatory framework and concern for competition that the recent bungled auction lacked . 
Chile &apos;s traditional left , arguing that lithium is legally classified as a strategic resource , rules out any further private-sector involvement in its production . 
Social networks are teeming with claims that if the state retains control over lithium production , the resulting revenue will solve Chile &apos;s problems in financing education , health care , and housing . 
But those making such claims have not done their arithmetic properly . 
Chile &apos;s annual lithium exports amount to a little more than $ 200 million - just 0.5 % of the country &apos;s copper exports . 
The entire world lithium market involves less than $ 800 million a year in transactions . 
Even if technological change causes that market - and Chile &apos;s share of it - to grow , primary lithium production will not provide the revenues needed to fund Chile &apos;s social programs . 
A better approach is to develop the skills needed to foster a domestic lithium industry , which can provide good jobs and good wages . 
This solution is unlikely to please ideologues on either end of the political spectrum . 
But it is the right solution for Chile .
