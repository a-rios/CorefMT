Political Evolution 
People everywhere want a new relationship with power - more autonomy and more respect . 
This reflects our current era , in which new knowledge , ideas , and possibilities have made our identities richer , more fluid , and less subject to fate . 
At the same time , the information society and globalization have made ours a more insecure world , where we experience risks that politics-as-usual has been unable to address . 
As the leader of a political party , the central idea for me nowadays is to empower individuals . 
A traditional party leader says to his followers , &quot; You can trust me . &quot; 
I think the future for progressive politics lies in leaders trusting citizens . 
It &apos;s a new kind of relationship . 
We in PASOK , the party that I lead , have started to think through what we want out of politics in a practical sense and how this can be delivered in a way that respects people &apos;s lives . 
We &apos;re making changes at the top in order to open up our party to greater participation . 
We need to highlight , not hide , different views , and see our parties less as &quot; war headquarters &quot; and more as bio-diverse think tanks or workshops . 
People can easily become lost in today &apos;s ocean of information . 
They will always be looking for a lighthouse , faros , as we say in Greek . 
But what are these lighthouses ? 
In an information society they will be those who are trusted to be able to help interpret or analyse what is happening . 
So I believe that the future for political parties is to develop a culture of debate , dialogue , and critical understanding of issues , where people can help set a nation &apos;s priorities and are not simply told by experts or their leaders what is right and wrong for them . 
Big issues , such as migration , narcotics , or the environment , no longer fall within a traditional left-right framework . 
For example , people may see an inevitable tradeoff between tough environmental standards and jobs . 
It is no longer just one side against the other . 
The nature of capitalist growth requires us to take a more holistic view and work out how we can achieve sustainable development . 
Of course , bringing more democracy into our daily lives cannot mean perpetual debate , without actually making decisions . 
Rather , it should mean that certain principles of respect , consultation , and deliberation become part of everyday life . 
There is , by contrast , a traditional style of leadership that almost encourages fear and insecurity , so that a savior can come along and say , &quot; I am the one who will solve this . &quot; 
President George W. Bush projects this style very openly . 
I opposed the Bush administration &apos;s policy on Iraq because this type of foreign policy is associated with a form of power - resurgent , I believe , in conservative parties around the world - that projects leadership as command . 
I know this mindset well . 
When I was first elected as a member of parliament in 1981 , people said , &quot; Now George , you &apos;ve got to bang the table . &quot; 
People would say you look weak if you &apos;re not cursing the opposition and driving around in a big black car wearing a tie . 
Above all , to be &quot; strong , &quot; you &apos;re supposed to be giving orders . 
I said to myself , &quot; I &apos;m going to have to go about things in a more democratic way . &quot; 
I realized that I would have to fight to communicate what I wanted to achieve . 
There was a whole political culture that had to change . 
Part of my thinking concerns personal style , but also something deeper : the relationship between professional politicians and voters . 
Obviously , there is a point where a leader must commit to a decision . 
Power by itself has no principles . 
Our societies and citizens need more freedom if we are to build a more peaceful , prosperous , and secure world . 
Consider the example of Greek-Turkish relations , which had hardened under the compressed weight of &quot; establishment &quot; views that were long entrenched in both countries . 
Only a new approach could break the mold of conventional wisdom . 
Quite often in confrontational situations , people and politicians create a zero-sum game culture , which results in authoritarian and militaristic leadership . 
We in the former PASOK government instead helped create a more positive framework by declaring our commitment to work for consensus , thereby creating the basis for trust and mutual understanding . 
Political parties everywhere must now become an agent for similar change . 
Nowadays , the framework of power itself - the old-fashioned party hierarchy that takes command of the state or municipality - is a kind of abuse . 
It takes power away from people in their own names , but gives them fear rather than confidence . 
Not surprisingly , my party is now seeking to return to power in the next election . 
We will not be returned to government unless we offer a better kind of democracy in the long term . 
In this enedeavor , we hope to set an example to the world .
