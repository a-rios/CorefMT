The Shape of America &apos;s Recession 
NEW YORK - Now that it is clear that the United States is in recession , the debate has moved on to whether it will be short and shallow or long and deep - a question that is as important for the rest of the world as it is for the US . 
The answer depends on the shape of the US recession : if it is short and shallow , sufficient growth elsewhere will ensure only a slight global slowdown . 
But if the US recession is long and severe , the result could be outright recession in some countries ( the United Kingdom , Spain , Ireland , Italy , and Japan ) , and even financial crises in vulnerable emerging-market economies . 
In principle , the US recession could end up being shaped like a V , U , W , or L. Which of these four scenarios is most likely ? 
The current consensus is that the recession will be V-shaped - short and shallow - and thus similar to the US recessions in 1990-91 and 2001 , which lasted eight months each . 
Most analysts forecast that GDP will contract in the first half of 2008 and recover in the second half of the year . 
I expect a longer and deeper U-shaped recession , lasting at least 12 months and possibly as long as 18 months - one of the most severe US recessions in decades - because today &apos;s macroeconomic and financial conditions are far worse . 
First , the US is experiencing its worst housing recession since the Great Depression , and the slump is not over . 
Construction of new homes has fallen about 50 % , while new home sales are down more than 60 % , creating a supply glut that is driving prices down sharply - 10 % so far and probably another 10 % this year and in 2009 . 
Already , $ 2.2 trillion of wealth has been wiped out , and about eight million households have negative equity : their homes &quot; are worth less than their mortgages . 
By 2010 , the fall in home prices will be close to 30 % with $ 6.6 trillion of home equity destroyed and 21 million households - 40 % of the 51 million with a mortgage - facing negative equity . 
If owners walk away from their homes , credit losses could be $ 1 trillion or more , wiping out most of the US financial system &apos;s capital and leading to a systemic banking crisis . 
Second , in 2001 , weak capital spending in the corporate sector ( accounting for 10 % of GDP ) underpinned the contraction . 
Today , it is private consumption in the household sector ( 70 % of GDP ) that is in trouble . 
American consumers are shopped-out , saving-less , debt-burdened ( 136 % of income , on average ) , and buffeted by many negative shocks . 
Third , the US is experiencing its most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression . 
Losses are spreading from sub-prime to near-prime and prime mortgages , commercial mortgages , and unsecured consumer credit ( credit cards , auto loans , student loans ) . 
Total financial losses - including possibly $ 1 trillion in mortgages and related securitized products - could be as high as $ 1.7 trillion . 
Given these staggering sums , the US could face a double-dip , W-shaped recession . 
Given how financially stretched US households are , a good part of this tax rebate may be used to pay down high credit card balances ( or other unsecured consumer credit ) or to postpone mortgage delinquency . 
Fortunately , an L-shaped period of protracted economic stagnation - Japan &apos;s experience in the 1990 &quot; s - is unlikely . 
Japan waited almost two years after its asset bubble collapsed to ease monetary policy and provide a fiscal stimulus , whereas in the US both steps came early . 
Moreover , whereas Japan postponed corporate and bank restructuring for years , in the US private and especially public efforts to restructure assets and firms will start faster and be more aggressive . 
Still , given a severe financial crisis , declining home prices , and a credit crunch , the US is facing its longest and deepest recession in decades , dashing any hope of a soft landing for the rest of the world . 
Many European economies are already slowing , with some entering recession . 
China and Asia are particularly vulnerable , given their trade links to the US . 
And emerging markets will suffer once the US contraction and global slowdown undermines commodity prices .
