Consequences of the Iraq War 
The Iraq war &apos;s main consequences will not be on the battlefield . 
They will come later , and will depend on whether George Bush and Tony Blair can justify their onslaught on a largely defenseless population . 
They launched this war for certain declared reasons , all of which were heatedly debated around the world . 
If they are vindicated , then the war could conceivably bring a safer world . 
If their arguments remain unproved or are disproved , then the war will incite instability . 
In that case , a critical step towards healing the world would be their quick departure from office . 
The Iraq War was not and could not be justified on the basis that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant . 
Justification , if it exists , rests on the danger Saddam &apos;s regime posed . 
Bush and Blair made four claims : 
Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction ; 
those weapons pose a grave , immediate threat ; 
UN inspections were not eliminating that threat ; 
the threat could best be eliminated by war . 
The first claim should be the easiest to verify . 
Bush and Blair talked repeatedly about stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , massive underground and mobile units to produce or launch such weapons , and active programs to obtain nuclear weapons . 
It is incumbent upon Bush and Blair to prove their case , and to prove it in the face of worldwide suspicion that the US and UK security agencies might plant phony evidence . 
For this reason , independent UN experts should assess any evidence that is uncovered . 
If no evidence of such weapons is produced , then both Bush and Blair deserve to be finished politically , no matter what else happens in Iraq . 
The second claim will be trickier to prove . 
Bush and Blair must show that any weapons of mass destruction that are recovered posed a grave and urgent threat . 
We know that Iraq at one time possessed chemical and biological weapons , because the US sold them to Iraq . 
The test is not whether traces of those weapons remain , as such traces will be found at disposal sites , but whether those weapons were poised for use in threatening amounts . 
If the Iraqis launch an attack with such weapons , this would demonstrate that the weapons were ready for use . 
Whether they posed any real threat outside Iraq &apos;s borders , or would have been used in the absence of the current war , must still be assessed . 
The third claim is hugely contentious . 
Bush and Blair should demonstrate that the UN inspection process was failing . 
This can be done by showing that the Iraqis were simply hiding the evidence at sites visited by the inspectors and declared free of weapons . 
There should be a systematic review of sites that were visited . 
There should also be an explanation , if weapons of mass destruction are uncovered at other sites , as to why the inspectors could not have found such weapons in a realistic period of time . 
The fourth claim will be subject to wild propaganda on both sides . 
Was the war justified in terms of costs and benefits , and was war really the last resort ? 
This will depend on an objective assessment of the costs of the war in terms of loss of life , destruction of property , economic impact within Iraq , spillovers into other forms of violence such as terrorism , and geopolitical consequences . 
To date , Bush and Blair have failed to make the case to the world , with the partial exception of their own countries . 
The American people have been treated to a spectacle of jingoism , fear mongering , confusion of Iraq with Osama bin Laden &apos;s terrorists , and simple patriotism . 
None of this swayed the rest of the world , which views the war with disdain and alarm . 
This would change if evidence on the four points is mustered . 
When the 13 British colonies in North America launched their own War of Independence , Thomas Jefferson understood that &quot; the decent respect to the opinions of mankind &quot; required an explanation for that war , which he set forth in the Declaration of Independence . 
Such an explanation , backed by rigorous evidence , is no less necessary today . 
If the arguments for war are not proved , the consequences will be profound . 
Propaganda , streets lined with cheering Iraqis , amazement over the prowess of US smart bombs , would not distract us from an awful truth-that Bush and Blair shattered world peace , engaged in massive premeditated killing , and did so against overwhelming global opinion . 
Healing today &apos;s divided world could start only with fresh political leadership in both the US and UK , and a strong assertion of UN authority . 
Given the terrible costs , I hope that this war will prove justified , though I have my doubts based on the current evidence . 
If compelling evidence proves that weapons of mass destruction were at hand ; that they were poised for use on a threatening scale ; that the UN inspectors had poor prospects of uncovering and dismantling those weapons , then we must acknowledge the arguments made by Bush and Blair . 
Even in those circumstances , war might well have been unwise compared to a policy of containment . 
Still , the war would then at least make some sense . 
The horrors of a senseless war are almost too frightening to contemplate .
