The Middle Kingdom &apos;s Middle Class 
HONG KONG  -  Why has China succeeded so spectacularly in the span of just three decades since the launch of Deng Xiaoping &apos;s economic reforms ? 
The reasons that are usually cited are China &apos;s compelling demographic , geographic , and broad cultural factors . 
What is less understood is that China &apos;s success has also depended on its entrepreneurs - and their deeply rooted patterns of activity . 
There are two key aspects of Chinese entrepreneurship . 
Traditionally , successful Chinese businessmen emphasized trust and reliability in fulfilling commitments ( xinyong ) , the gradual development of sentiments ( ganqing ) with customers and suppliers , and the ability to build on networks of relationships ( guanxi ) that are often based on common origin or kinship . 
They also stressed the need to be bold , frugal , and highly driven to succeed , as well as the ability to adapt to changing market conditions . 
Some of these characteristics are more culturally specific than Joseph Schumpeter &apos;s description of entrepreneurship as a process of &quot; creative destruction &quot; might imply . 
But boldness and adaptability do accord with Schumpeter &apos;s emphasis on forming new combinations and doing things in new ways . 
For example , traditional businesses , from fabric wholesaling to banking and salt mining , evolved elaborate profit-sharing schemes among owners , partners , and employees as their business expanded over time or into chain outlets across the country . 
When new forms of business such as textile manufacturing and department stores came to China from the West in the late nineteenth century , Chinese businessmen quickly adopted them and adapted them to local conditions . 
More recently , local managers who took on McDonald &apos;s franchises transformed several aspects of the business to fit Chinese tastes and habits . 
A second aspect of Chinese entrepreneurship is the kind of institutions and the management style that it embodies . 
I have studied many Chinese firms that flourished from the early-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century . 
They all seem to have the following core features : 
· Small to medium size , with a relatively simple organizational structure ; 
· Considerable overlap of ownership by individuals linked by family and kinship ties , or by partnerships among kin and family friends ; 
· Centralized and disciplined decision-making ; 
· Personal and family networking that encourages opportunistic diversification , transcending regional and national boundaries to expand ; 
· Cooperation with affiliate firms to reduce transaction costs in sourcing , capital acquisition , and contracts ; 
· A high degree of strategic adaptability . 
These structural features fit well with Chinese merchants , who did not want to see their companies grow so large that they attracted official attention . 
Successful businessmen could in fact build up extensive holdings by owning or sharing several businesses . 
Since China never established male primogeniture , this meant that when he died , each son could have his own business to start with . 
Likewise , the functional features of Chinese entrepreneurship were heavily dependent on cultural values , particularly given a financial and legal system that was often unreliable . 
Thus , control and management were carried out mostly by family members and kin , with support through networking with those in an established relationship of trust . 
This history and evolution matter in trying to understand today &apos;s Chinese entrepreneurs . 
Of course , one special group today comprises the children of officials , from powerful national party leaders to local satraps who use their family connections to their advantage . 
But this group &apos;s members are usually not among the most successful entrepreneurs ; none , for example , has been included in the annual Forbes list of the ten richest persons in China . 
The great majority of the roughly 24 million private individuals estimated to have gone into business between 1980 and 2005 were ordinary folk with very small capital - usually obtained by pooling the savings of family members and perhaps friends . 
Their businesses include small stores or a stand on a busy sidewalk selling specific goods or providing some service . 
Only some three million of these businesses gained sufficient size and organization to form limited-liability corporations that issued shares . 
And all firms with annual revenues of $ 1 million or more seem to have required some form of support from party officials , who serve as gatekeepers for all forms of licensing , sourcing , and financing . 
In recent years , some of these controls have been relaxed . 
Attending to the gate-keeping role of party officials has become less of a necessity . 
But networking and party connections continue to matter . 
And , aside from a relatively small number of joint ventures with foreign partners and state enterprises that are in fact hybrid public-private firms , most businesses today , including publicly listed companies , remain family owned or dominated . 
Some may have grown large in size and scale , but only to the point where they could compete efficiently in international markets . 
Even the small number of national companies that have grown large are relatively small when compared to the Japanese kereitsu or the Korean chaebol . 
Chinese entrepreneurs nowadays are particularly well adapted to take advantage of new market trends brought about by rapidly changing fashion and similarly rapid technological progress . 
Their relatively small companies and their efficient decision-making processes allow them to remain nimble and to react quickly . 
In addition , their often highly diversified structure and their loose network of affiliates and supply chains allow Chinese entrepreneurs to reconfigure business strategy and production facilities quickly , thereby bringing new products to market with shorter lead time . 
For example , Chinese cell-phone companies offered 3-G phones much earlier than in America , and when they learned that each phone was being used by several individuals in rural China , they programmed their phones to allow multiple accounts for each phone , thereby adding tens of millions of new subscribers . 
Despite continuing political restrictions imposed by an authoritarian regime , Deng Xiaoping succeeded beyond his wildest imagination .
