Uniting Europe &apos;s Fleets 
PARIS - Of Europe &apos;s 23 naval forces , only France &apos;s possesses a fully operational aircraft carrier , the 40,000-ton flagship Charles de Gaulle . 
Although the United Kingdom is currently building two carriers of its own , the Royal Navy is years away from the capability to deliver instant airpower from the sea . 
Nevertheless , Europe is reasonably equipped to defend itself against external threats . 
It is less able , however , to withstand looming budget cuts . 
Europe &apos;s maritime-security strategy has long been founded on two key tenets . 
First , sea-borne trade routes , which account for nearly 85 % of the European Union &apos;s total exports and imports , must be kept free and safe . 
And , second , European countries must maintain the capacity to deal with any major security crisis . 
International events highlight these priorities &quot; relevance . 
For example , rising tensions with Iran could compel Europe to deploy its navies to form a blockade around the Persian Gulf , in order to ensure the transit of oil . 
Similarly , piracy in the Gulf of Guinea and the Indian Ocean , particularly along the coast of Somalia , threatens Europe &apos;s maritime activities , including its extensive sea-borne commerce . 
Indeed , growing concerns over piracy led to the launch in 2008 of the EU &apos;s first naval response within the framework of the Common Security and Defense Policy ( CSDP ) - Operation Atalanta . 
The operation , held annually and comprising 5-10 combat vessels , 1-2 auxiliary ships , and 2-4 maritime-patrol aircraft , includes forces from 26 European navies , and has undoubtedly helped to discourage , if not end , pirate attacks . 
Atalanta &apos;s success , combined with European naval forces &quot; leading role in last year &apos;s operations in Libya , shows that Europe possesses much of the naval infrastructure that it needs to ensure its maritime security . 
But the Libyan crisis also revealed that Europe &apos;s naval security is limited and easily overstretched . 
More than half of French naval forces were deployed during the Libyan crisis , during which their normal activity rate increased by 10-40 % - at a cost of â‚¬ 40 million ( $ 50 million ) , not to mention disruptions of standard training and maintenance . 
Naval assets are not only expensive to build ; they are extremely costly to operate , as each unit requires specialized equipment and highly trained personnel . 
As a result , navies are often among the first to be targeted by cuts in defense budgets . 
And yet , while naval deployments do not always end conflicts , they are a vital component of the military response to any crisis , and are critical to guaranteeing Europe &apos;s security . 
Given this , it is imperative that European governments adopt cost-cutting measures that do not jeopardize their naval assets . 
First , the EU should take a leading role in maximizing the efficiency of each member state &apos;s navy , by creating mechanisms that would facilitate the exchange of information between governments , maritime agencies , and navies . 
Indeed , sound political decisions can achieve just as much as buying new ships - and at a far lower cost . 
Adopting a comprehensive legal framework would be a useful first step . 
Indeed , improved coordination between countries would contribute to more cost-efficient use of resources and equipment . 
Surveillance strategies , for example , are often more expensive than necessary , owing to poor communication . 
Information-sharing among Europe &apos;s navies would also help to identify and fill existing gaps , thus paving the way for a more efficient European maritime-security infrastructure . 
At the same time , in order to maintain a security framework fit to confront any conceivable security threat , Europe &apos;s governments should preserve the entire spectrum of their naval assets . 
Mothballing ships for the sake of saving money could have dire consequences for Europe &apos;s security . 
Rather than focusing on shrinking the size of existing fleets , European leaders should focus on getting more out of them . 
To this end , Europe &apos;s navies and maritime agencies should merge their capabilities , especially those related to defense and security missions . 
This would bring massive savings , which could be reinvested in technological advances , thereby further equipping Europe &apos;s navies to meet future threats . 
Accurately assessing maritime operations &quot; success requires time and care , because naval capabilities cannot be built up quickly . 
While reducing such capabilities might seem like an expedient way to cut costs , European governments must not lose sight of their long-term security priorities . 
Above all , European leaders must promote increased naval cooperation . 
After all , naval capacities are essential to the projection of European power - and crucial to maintaining geopolitical stability around the world .
