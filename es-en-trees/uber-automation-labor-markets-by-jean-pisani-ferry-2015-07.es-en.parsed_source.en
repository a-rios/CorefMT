The End of Work as We Know It 
PARIS - In 1983 , the American economist and Nobel laureate Wassily Leontief made what was then a startling prediction . 
Machines , he said , are likely to replace human labor much in the same way that the tractor replaced the horse . 
Today , with some 200 million people worldwide out of work - 30 million more than in 2008 - Leontief &apos;s words no longer seem as outlandish as they once did . 
Indeed , there can be little doubt that technology is in the process of completely transforming the global labor market . 
To be sure , predictions like Leontief &apos;s leave many economists skeptical , and for good reason . 
Historically , increases in productivity have rarely destroyed jobs . 
Each time that machines yielded gains in efficiency ( including when tractors took over from horses ) , old jobs disappeared , but new jobs were created . 
Furthermore , economists are number crunchers , and recent data show a slowdown - rather than an acceleration - in productivity gains . 
When it comes to the actual number of jobs available , there are reasons to question the doomsayers &quot; dire predictions . 
Yet there are also reasons to think that the nature of work is changing . 
To begin with , as noted by the MIT economist David Autor , advances in the automation of labor transform some jobs more than others . 
Workers carrying out routine tasks like data processing are increasingly likely to be replaced by machines ; but those pursuing more creative endeavors are more likely to experience increases in productivity . 
Meanwhile , workers providing in-person services might not see their jobs change much at all . 
In other words , robots might put an accountant out of work , boost a surgeon &apos;s productivity , and leave a hairdresser &apos;s job unaltered . 
The resulting upheavals in the structure of the workforce can be at least as important as the actual number of jobs that are affected . 
Economists call the most likely outcome of this phenomenon &quot; the polarization of employment . &quot; 
Automation creates service jobs at the bottom end of the wage scale and raises the quantity and profitability of jobs at its top end . 
But the middle of the labor market becomes hollowed out . 
This type of polarization has been going on in the United States for decades , and it is taking place in Europe too - with important consequences for society . 
Since the end of World War II , the middle class has provided the backbone of democracy , civil engagement , and stability ; those who did not belong to the middle class could realistically aspire to join it , or even believe that they were part of it , when that was not the case . 
As changes in the job market break down the middle class , a new era of class rivalry could be unleashed ( if it has not been already ) . 
In addition to the changes being wrought by automation , the job market is being transformed by digital platforms like Uber that facilitate exchanges between consumers and individual suppliers of services . 
A customer calling an Uber driver is purchasing not one service , but two : one from the company ( the connection to a driver whose quality is assured through customer ratings ) and the other from the driver ( transport from one location to another ) . 
Uber and other digital platforms are redefining the interaction among consumers , workers , and employers . 
They are also making the celebrated firm of the industrial age - an essential institution , which allowed for specialization and saved on transactions costs - redundant . 
Unlike at a firm , Uber &apos;s relationship with its drivers does not rely on a traditional employment contract . 
Instead , the company &apos;s software acts as a mediator between the driver and the consumer , in exchange for a fee . 
This seemingly small change could have far-reaching consequences . 
Rather than being regulated by a contract , the value of labor is being subjected to the same market forces buffeting any other commodity , as services vary in price depending on supply and demand . 
Labor becomes marked to market . 
Other , less disruptive changes , such as the rise of human capital , could also be mentioned . 
An increasing number of young graduates shun seemingly attractive jobs in major companies , preferring to earn much less working for start-ups or creative industries . 
While this can be explained partly by the appeal of the corresponding lifestyle , it may also be a way to increase their overall lifetime income . 
Instead of renting their set of skills and competences for a pre-set price , these young graduates prefer to maximize the lifetime income stream they may derive from their human capital . 
Again , such behavior undermines the employment contract as a basic social institution and makes a number of its associated features , such as annual income taxation , suboptimal . 
Whatever we think of the new arrangements , we are unlikely to be able to stop them . 
Some might be tempted to resist - witness the recent clashes between taxi and Uber drivers in Paris and the lawsuits against the company in many countries . 
Uber &apos;s arrangement may be fraudulent according to the existing legal framework , but that framework will eventually change . 
The transformative impacts of technology will ultimately make themselves felt . 
Rather than try to stop the unstoppable , we should think about how to put this new reality at the service of our values and welfare . 
In addition to rethinking institutions and practices predicated on traditional employment contracts - such as social security contributions - we will need to begin to invent new institutions that harness this technology-driven transformation for our collective benefit . 
The backbone of tomorrow &apos;s societies , after all , will be built not by robots or digital platforms , but by their citizens .
