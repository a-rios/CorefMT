Islands of Isolation 
PARIS - The Japanese and the British may seem very different , but a closer look reveals something akin to a parallel destiny for these two island peoples . 
With their old imperial ambitions and widespread distaste for the great continents from which the narrowest of seas divide them , both the British and the Japanese are vulnerable to the siren song of isolationism . 
Unfortunately , both now appear to be succumbing to that dangerous temptation . 
Perhaps geography is destiny . 
As islanders , Britons and Japanese have had wary relations with - and often a superiority complex toward - their great continental neighbors , Europe and China , respectively . 
Both historically compensated for their isolation with strong central governments , powerful navies , dynamic entrepreneurship , vibrant culture , and imperial ambition . 
Today , Japan and the United Kingdom pretend to be open societies , and to be stakeholders in the globalization process . 
In reality , both remain mostly inward looking and preoccupied with the disintegration of their original culture . 
Both try desperately to keep immigrants at bay , whether through cultural segregation in the UK or , in Japan &apos;s case , by mere rejection . 
The more civilizations become intertwined in the new world order , the more the Japanese and British are tempted to remain aloof and apart . 
In Japan , the isolationist temptation is expressed in the current nostalgia for the Edo period , from 1600 to 1868 , before Emperor Meiji opened Japan to the world . 
&quot; Back to Edo &quot; has become a dominant mood and theme in public debates , promoted by writers , pundits , and historians like Inose Naoki ( who is also Vice Governor of Tokyo ) , who argue that the Japanese were much happier within their closed world , blissfully insulated from the quest for material success and international status . 
This &quot; Back to Edo &quot; discourse translates into the refusal of young Japanese to learn a foreign language or travel abroad . 
Indeed , in Europe , North America , and elsewhere , the omnipresent Japanese tourists of the 1970 &quot; s have been replaced by Chinese and Koreans . 
The number of Japanese studying abroad is at a new low at the very moment when South Koreans and Chinese are swarming into European and North American universities . 
Even the world &apos;s great universities , from Harvard to Oxford , are seeing fewer Japanese students . 
Here the British are very much mimicking the Japanese : fewer and fewer are learning foreign languages , studying abroad , and following the old path of working in Hong Kong , Singapore , or Australia . 
So prevalent is this &quot; little England &quot; mood that Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s government is now tempted to hold a referendum to ask the British whether they want to remain within the European Union , a vote that even that arch euro-skeptic , Margaret Thatcher , never risked . 
The prospect of a referendum reflects the overwhelming mood among the Tories , who sometimes mention Norway - a non-EU member whose main role in global affairs is to award the Nobel Peace Prize - as a model for Britain &apos;s role in the world . 
Of course , Norway has the world &apos;s highest per capita income . 
But that is not the relevant standard against which the UK or other Western countries should measure themselves , because Norway has a tiny , homogeneous , population and sits on vast - and well-managed - natural resources . 
If asked in a referendum , the British might well leave the EU , which they never liked . 
This would have the unintended consequence of strengthening the federalists on the continent , thereby accelerating the integration dynamic that the British now want to stop . 
Indeed , the British would leave just when Iceland , Serbia , Turkey , and Ukraine , despite Europe &apos;s current crisis , are trying to get in . 
And , while the eurozone may be in crisis , Poland , among others , still want to join in the near future . 
The British may turn their nose up at the euro - to which even the supposedly independent Swiss franc is pegged - but it will almost certainly remain the currency of nearly 300 million Europeans . 
Isolationism , whether in Japan or the UK , is not only a short-sighted choice ; especially for Japan , it may also be a perilous one , given the rise of China next door . 
Both Japan and the UK , much as they may not wish to admit it , depend on the global market . 
Isolationism would leave their citizens ill prepared to confront competition and their governments excluded from decisions that impact the global economy and trade . 
Nor can isolationism guarantee national security at a time of rising threats from terrorist groups and rising ambitions on the part of China and Russia . 
The Edo nostalgia in Japan and the Norway model &apos;s appeal in the UK are not rational choices . 
They merely channel national wariness at a time of global competition between cultures , economies , and emerging strategic ambitions . 
Sometimes nations , like individuals , grow tired and long for their idealized youth - a recurrent phenomenon that historians call &quot; declinism . &quot; 
Whether one calls it that or a desire for a holiday from history , Japan and the UK today seem to be choosing a path that will only accelerate decline .
