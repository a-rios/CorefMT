After Kyoto 
The Kyoto Protocol treaty has now entered into force for the 126 nations who have joined it so far . 
Now is the time to start thinking about how to engage all nations , including large emitters , in conversations about what to do after the treaty &apos;s expiration in 2012 . 
This is exactly what the European Commission did recently by providing its first strategy for a post-Kyoto era , which will be discussed by the European Council next March . 
While the Kyoto Protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries - 5.2 % between 2008-2012 relative to 1990 levels , with varying targets for individual countries - real progress can be made in sustaining development efforts and preserving our planet . 
But first , all countries must integrate climate concerns into policy planning , and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy , infrastructure , and transport . 
In other words , we must act in accordance with the recognition that climate change and its effects on people in both rich and poor countries remains a threat to global security . 
At the end of the day , the long-term approach is likely to include a rules-based system , an incentives system , and investments in technology change . 
Increasingly , adaptation at the national level will be recognized as a major issue that will require appropriate funding . 
Dealing with the impacts of climate change and with emission reductions should not be mutually exclusive , but complementary . 
Looking ahead to the post-Kyoto world offers us the chance to start a new dialogue and to look at new options on climate change . 
Nations could set the more ambitious goal of limiting the long-term change in the earth &apos;s temperature , and then assign emissions rights among countries in such a way that will eventually limit temperature increases to an acceptable level . 
This would require increasing investments in energy research and development for new and improved technologies - a process that needs to be supported by stronger public-private partnerships . 
Up to now , with only 15 % of the world &apos;s population , rich countries have been responsible for more than 75 % of global carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions , and thus most of the environmental damage . 
However , it is the developing countries - and thus the world &apos;s poor - who are most vulnerable . 
It is unrealistic to ask poor countries , where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies , to bear the costs associated with the much needed technological change . 
Working with partners , the World Bank is supporting financial strategies to assist developing countries in meeting the costs caused by climate change . 
To date , over $ 1 billion dollars in Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) grants , together with about $ 8 billion in co-financing , have been committed to programs related to climate change . 
While the regulatory mechanisms of both Kyoto and the European Trading Scheme have contributed to the establishment of an emerging market for carbon trading , interested parties are now concerned about the immediate future . 
Without a regulatory framework beyond 2012 , the window of opportunity for initiating project-based transactions will close by 2006 / 2007 . 
Given the long lead time between project preparation and the first benefits of emissions reductions , project developers have only a few years to act before carbon payments cease to make a meaningful contribution to project finance in the current context . 
Developing infrastructure projects is a long process that requires 3-7 years from identification , through licensing , financing , and construction , and finally to the first certification of carbon emission reductions . 
Therefore , projects need to be operational at the latest by 2007 . 
The World Bank has been instrumental in advancing carbon finance as a viable development tool , and in facilitating private-sector participation in the market . 
The Bank is focused on representing the interests of its borrowing countries , helping them to develop assets for carbon trading according to their own priorities . 
But , without a commitment by governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012 , the carbon market will remain uncertain , and the private sector - vital to the market &apos;s success - is unlikely to expand its participation in a meaningful and sustained way . 
According to a recent World Bank-supported survey of companies interested in carbon finance , only one in five respondents declared that they were interested in buying post-2012 emissions reductions . 
Now is the chance to look forward and enlist the global community - with no exclusions , although with differentiated responsibilities - in the pursuit of a more secure world , one that avoids the dire risks of environmental degradation and social conflict implied by inaction .
