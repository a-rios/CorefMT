Is China &apos;s Economy Overheating ? 
The Chinese economy has been growing at such a breathtaking annual pace - 9.5 % in the year ending in the second quarter of 2005 - that it is the toast of the world , an apparent inspiration for developing countries everywhere . 
But is China getting too much of a good thing ? 
Since he became president in 2003 , Hu Jintao has repeatedly warned that China &apos;s economy is overheating , and his government has recently acted accordingly , raising interest rates last October , imposing a new tax on home sales in June , and revaluing the Yuan in July . 
But claims that China is overheating don &apos;t seem to be based on observations of inflation . 
While China &apos;s consumer price index rose 5.3 % in the year ending in July 2004 , this was due primarily to a spike in food prices ; both before and since , inflation has been negligible . 
Nor are these claims based on the Chinese stock market , which has generally followed a downward path over the past few years . 
Instead , those who argue that the Chinese economy is overheating cite the high rate of investment in plant and equipment and real estate , which reached 43 % of GDP in 2004 . 
On this view , China has been investing too much , building too many factories , importing too many machines , and constructing too many new homes . 
But can an emerging economy invest too much ? 
Doesn &apos;t investment mean improving people &apos;s lives ? 
The more factories and machines a country has , and the more it replaces older factories and machines with more up-to-date models , the more productive its labor force is . 
The more houses it builds , the better the private lives of its citizens . 
A number of studies show that economic growth is linked to investment in machines and factories . 
In 1992 , Bradford DeLong of the University of California at Berkeley and Lawrence Summers , now President of Harvard University , showed in a famous paper that countries with higher investment , especially in equipment , historically have had higher economic growth . 
One of their examples showed that Japan &apos;s GDP per worker more than tripled relative to Argentina &apos;s from 1960 to 1985 , because Japan , unlike Argentina , invested heavily in new machinery and equipment . 
In short , the more equipment and infrastructure a country is installing , the more its people have to work with . 
Moreover , the more a country invests in equipment , the more it learns about the latest technology - and it learns about it in a very effective , &quot; hands-on &quot; way . 
It would thus appear that there is nothing wrong with China continuing to buy new equipment , build new factories , and construct new roads and bridges as fast as its can . 
The faster , the better , so that the billion or so people there who have not yet reached prosperity by world standards can get there within their lifetimes . 
And yet any government has to watch that the investment is being made effectively . 
In China , the widespread euphoria about the economy is reason for concern . 
Some universal human weaknesses can result in irrational behavior during an economic boom . 
Simply put , China &apos;s problem is that its economic growth has been so spectacular that it risks firing people &apos;s imaginations a bit too intensely . 
At times like these , people can easily imagine that an apartment in Shanghai will be worth some enormous amount in 10 or 20 years , when China is vastly more prosperous than it is today . 
And if it will be worth an enormous amount in 10 or 20 years , then it should be worth a lot today , too , since real interest rates - used to discount future values to today &apos;s values - are still low in China . 
People are excited , and they are lining up to buy . 
To be sure , their reasoning is basically correct . 
But when the ultimate determinants of values today become so dependent on a distant future that we cannot see clearly , we may not be able to think clearly , either . 
Since the true value of long-term assets is so hard to estimate , it is human nature to focus on the rate of increase in their observed prices , and to allow one &apos;s attention to become fixated on these assets just as their value is increasing very fast . 
This can lead people to make serious mistakes , paying more for long-term assets than they should , even assuming that the economy will perform spectacularly well in the future . 
They can overextend their finances , fall victim to promotions , invest carelessly in the wrong assets , and direct production into regions and activities on the basis of momentary excitement rather than calculation of economic fundamentals . 
So , maybe the word &quot; overheated &quot; is misleading . 
It might be more accurate to say that public attention is over-focused on some recent price changes , or over-accepting of some high market values . 
Whatever one calls it , it is a problem . 
Fortunately , people also tend to trust their national leaders . 
For this reason , it is all the more important that the leaders not remain silent when a climate of speculation develops . 
Silence can be presumed to be tacit acceptance that rapid increases in long-term asset price are warranted . 
National leaders must speak out , and they must match their words with concrete actions , to help signal to the public that the speculative bubble cannot be expected to continue . 
That is what the Chinese government has begun to do . 
The real-estate boom appears to be cooling . 
If the government continues to pursue this policy , the salutary effects in terms of public trust in the country &apos;s businesses and institutions will help ensure stable , sustainable economic growth for years to come .
