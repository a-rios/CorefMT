Quantitative Easing for the People 
OXFORD - It is now a near certainty that , by the end of this year , falling energy and commodity prices will push annual inflation in the eurozone below zero - well under the European Central Bank &apos;s target of near 2 % . 
Rather than continue to allow misguided conventional thinking , centered on German economic ideology , to impede effective action , the ECB must pursue quantitative easing ( QE ) &quot; for the people &quot; - an adaptation of Milton Friedman &apos;s &quot; helicopter drops &quot; strategy - to reverse deflation and get the eurozone back on track . 
As it stands , conventional monetary policy has had - and American-style QE will have - little impact on the eurozone &apos;s core countries . 
This can be explained partly by the fact that , when it comes to credit provision , capital markets do far less of the heavy lifting in the eurozone ( where banks matter more ) than in the United States . 
As a result , bringing down yields on government , corporate , and asset-backed bonds has less impact . 
At the same time , the euro exchange rate - the one mechanism whereby current policies could still make a difference - cannot be pushed down much further . 
For starters , given the eurozone &apos;s huge trade surplus , doing so would incur strong international resistance . 
Moreover , the mechanisms by which the US Federal Reserve &apos;s purchases of asset-backed securities stimulate consumer spending - low mortgage rates , widely available home refinancing , high housing prices , and home-equity withdrawal - function differently in the eurozone . 
In Germany , France , and Italy , higher house prices spur non-owners to save more for the down payment and inspire caution among tenants , who expect future rent hikes . 
And the housing wealth of existing owners does not translate into significantly higher spending , given the lack of access to home-equity loans and cheap mortgage refinancing . 
Finally , in countries like Germany , where households &quot; bank and saving deposits far outweigh their debt , lower interest rates reduce total household spending . 
Another factor impeding QE &apos;s impact in the eurozone is low bond yields , which , by increasing measured pension-fund deficits , make some companies reluctant to invest and thus more likely to raise contribution rates and limit pension benefits . 
In the US , more generous assumptions regarding discount rates are used to calculate pension-fund liabilities . 
Furthermore , US-style QE , in particular , tends to have adverse distributional implications , because it channels more money toward the wealthy , who have a lower propensity to spend , without providing much to the poorer people who would use it to consume more . 
In the eurozone , the distribution issue is especially complex , given that institutional differences between countries can give the impression of discrimination among them . 
Clearly , the ECB must develop a strategy that works in the eurozone &apos;s unique system , instead of continuing to follow the Fed &apos;s lead . 
Such a strategy should be based on Friedman &apos;s assertion that &quot; helicopter drops &quot; - printing large sums of money and distributing it to the public - can always stimulate the economy and combat deflation . 
One simple solution would be to distribute the funds to governments , which could then decide how best to spend them in their countries . 
A more feasible option , therefore , would be to provide all workers and pensioners with social-security numbers ( or the local equivalent ) with a payment from the ECB , which governments would merely assist in distributing . 
Another alternative would be to use the electoral register , a public database that the ECB could use independently of governments . 
Of the roughly 275 million adults with social-security numbers in the eurozone , some 90 % are on the electoral register . 
Extrapolating from America &apos;s experience in 2001 , when a $ 300 per person social-security rebate boosted spending by about 25 % of the total amount distributed , a € 500 ( $ 640 ) check from the ECB could increase spending by about € 34 billion , or 1.4 % of GDP . 
The extra tax revenue that such a rebate would produce would reduce government deficits significantly . 
Beyond lifting the eurozone economy out of deflation , such an initiative would have massive political benefits , as it would reduce resentment toward European institutions , especially in struggling countries like Greece and Portugal , where an extra € 500 would have a particularly strong impact on spending . 
In this way , the ECB could prove to disgruntled citizens and investors that it is serious about meeting its inflation target , and even help to stem the rise of nationalist parties . 
To be sure , some countries - especially Germany - are likely to resist this approach by marshaling arguments about prudence and responsibility . 
After years of austerity , infighting , and unemployment , it is time to implement a QE program that delivers what Europe needs .
