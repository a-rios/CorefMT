International Norms in Cyberspace 
CAMBRIDGE - Last month , the Netherlands hosted the Global Conference on Cyberspace 2015 , which brought together nearly 2,000 government officials , academics , industry representatives , and others . 
I chaired a panel on cyber peace and security that included a Microsoft vice president and two foreign ministers . 
This &quot; multi-stakeholder &quot; conference was the latest in a series of efforts to establish rules of the road to avoid cyber conflict . 
The capacity to use the Internet to inflict damage is now well established . 
Many observers believe the American and Israeli governments were behind an earlier attack that destroyed centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear facility . 
Some say an Iranian government attack destroyed thousands of Saudi Aramco computers . 
Russia is blamed for denial-of-service attacks on Estonia and Georgia . 
And just last December , US President Barack Obama attributed an attack on Sony Pictures to the North Korean government . 
Until recently , cyber security was largely the domain of a small community of computer experts . 
When the Internet was created in the 1970s , its members formed a virtual village ; everyone knew one another , and together they designed an open system , paying little attention to security . 
Then , in the early 1990s , the World Wide Web emerged , growing from a few million users then to more than three billion today . 
In little more than a generation , the Internet has become the substrate of the global economy and governance worldwide . 
Several billion more human users will be added in the next decade , as will tens of billions of devices , ranging from thermostats to industrial control systems ( the &quot; Internet of Things &quot; ) . 
All of this burgeoning interdependence implies vulnerabilities that governments and non-governmental actors can exploit . 
At the same time , we are only beginning to come to terms with the national-security implications of this . 
Strategic studies of the cyber domain resemble nuclear strategy in the 1950s : analysts are still not clear about the meaning of offense , defense , deterrence , escalation , norms , and arms control . 
The term &quot; cyber war &quot; is used very loosely for a wide range of behaviors , ranging from simple probes , website defacement , and denial of service to espionage and destruction . 
In this , it reflects dictionary definitions of &quot; war , &quot; which include any organized effort to &quot; stop or defeat something that is viewed as dangerous or bad &quot; ( for example , &quot; war on drugs &quot; ) . 
A more useful definition of cyber war is any hostile action in cyberspace that amplifies or is equivalent in effect to major physical violence . 
Determining whether an action meets that criterion is a decision that only a country &apos;s political leaders can make . 
There are four major categories of cyber threats to national security , each with a different time horizon and ( in principle ) different solutions : cyber war and economic espionage , which are largely associated with states , and cyber crime and cyber terrorism , which are mostly associated with non-state actors . 
The highest costs currently stem from espionage and crime , but the other two may become greater threats over the next decade than they are today . 
Moreover , as alliances and tactics evolve , the categories may increasingly overlap . 
During the Cold War , ideological competition limited US-Soviet cooperation , but both sides &quot; awareness of nuclear destructiveness led them to develop a crude code of conduct to avoid military confrontation . 
These basic rules of prudence included no direct fighting , no first use of nuclear weapons , and crisis communication , such as the Moscow-Washington hotline and the Accidents Measures and Incidents at Sea agreements . 
The first formal arms-control agreement was the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty , which can be considered mainly an environmental treaty . 
The second major agreement was the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , which aimed at limiting the spread of nuclear weapons . 
The US and the Soviet Union perceived both agreements as positive-sum games , because they involved nature or third parties . 
Similarly , the most promising areas for early international cooperation on securing cyberspace are problems posed by third parties such as criminals and terrorists . 
Russia and China have sought a treaty for broad United Nations oversight of the Internet . 
Though their vision of &quot; information security &quot; could legitimize authoritarian governments &quot; censorship , and is therefore unacceptable to democratic governments , it may be possible to identify and target behaviors that are illegal everywhere . 
Limiting all intrusions would be impossible , but one could start with cyber crime and cyber terrorism . 
Major states would have an interest in limiting damage by agreeing to cooperate on forensics and controls . 
Of course , historical analogies are imperfect . 
Obviously , cyber technology is very different from nuclear technology , particularly because non-governmental actors can exploit it much more easily . 
Nonetheless , some institutions , both formal and informal , already govern the basic functioning of the Internet . 
The US wisely plans to strengthen the non-governmental Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) by having it supervise the Internet &quot; address book . &quot; 
There is also the Council of Europe &apos;s 2001 Convention on Cybercrime , with Interpol and Europol facilitating cooperation among national police forces . 
And a UN Group of Government Experts has been analyzing how international law relates to cyber security . 
It is likely to take longer to conclude agreements on contentious issues such as cyber intrusions for purposes like espionage and preparing the battlefield . 
Nonetheless , the inability to envisage an overall cyber arms-control agreement need not prevent progress on some issues now . 
International norms tend to develop slowly . 
The most important message of the recent Dutch conference was that massive cyber vulnerability is now nearing that point .
