Li Keqiang &apos;s Bottom Line 
SHANGHAI - Everyone is talking about China &apos;s economic slowdown . 
Last year , Chinese GDP growth reached a 13-year low , and no upturn is in sight . 
But , as Premier Li Keqiang seems to recognize , this trend could actually be beneficial , spurring the structural reforms that China needs to achieve its longer-term goal of more balanced and stable GDP growth . 
Recent assessments have offered a downbeat picture of the world &apos;s second-largest economy . 
In its latest Global Economic Prospects report , the World Bank cut its 2013 economic growth forecast for China from 8.4 % to 7.7 % . 
Moreover , recently released central-bank data show that Chinese banks increased their lending by only about ¥ 667 billion ( $ 108 billion ) in May - a roughly ¥ 125 billion decline from the same period last year . 
But simply lending more would not improve the situation . 
Given that outstanding loans already amount to nearly double China &apos;s GDP - a result of the country &apos;s massive stimulus since 2008 - new loans are largely being used to pay off old debts , rather than for investment in the real economy . 
Thus , the more relevant concern is that the balance of outstanding loans has not risen . 
In recent years , tight monetary policy and increasingly strict controls on the real-estate sector have caused the growth rate of fixed-asset investment to fall , from more than 25 % annually before 2008 to around 20 % today . 
Furthermore , the growth rate in China &apos;s less developed eastern regions amounts to less than half of the national average . 
As a result , growth of industrial value added - which contributes almost half of China &apos;s GDP - is slowing even faster , from an average annual rate of 20 % during China &apos;s boom years to less than 10 % in 2010-2012 and just 7.8 % in the first quarter of this year . 
The key to restoring China &apos;s GDP growth is , therefore , returning fixed-asset investment growth to at least 25 % . 
With a new round of stimulus , China &apos;s excess production capacity and underused outlays ( for example , built-up real-estate assets ) could be mobilized immediately , restoring 9 % annual GDP growth . 
But the willingness of China &apos;s new leadership to initiate another round of growth-securing stimulus depends on what rate of GDP growth Li can tolerate . 
With China &apos;s leaders having offered no indication that they will change current monetary policy , some economists have estimated that Li will not act until GDP growth falls below 7 % . 
The reason for Li &apos;s inaction emerged in early June , when Chinese President Xi Jinping told his American counterpart , Barack Obama , that China had deliberately revised its growth target downward , to 7.5 % , in order to pursue structural reforms aimed at supporting stable and sustained economic development . 
Given that China was moving toward such reforms before the 2008 global economic crisis prompted former Premier Wen Jiabao to launch his ¥ 4 trillion stimulus plan , Xi &apos;s statement suggests that the new government will seek to restore the economy &apos;s pre-2008 fundamentals . 
In 2005 , China was experiencing currency appreciation , which , as other fast-growing economies in East Asia have demonstrated , can stimulate the government and businesses to pursue structural reforms and industrial upgrading . 
But the subsequent increase in official fixed-asset investment - which rose by 32 % in 2009 alone - delayed structural reforms , while over-capacity and a real-estate bubble became even larger and more deeply entrenched problems . 
The government must now dispel the remaining vestiges of the stimulus-fueled over-investment of 2008-2010 , however painful it may be . 
This means allowing the economy to continue to slow , while maintaining relatively tight macroeconomic policies that force local governments and the business sector to find new sources of growth . 
The combination of external shocks and internal pressure from rising wages can serve as a powerful incentive for governments and businesses to pursue structural reforms . 
For example , firms in China &apos;s export-dependent coastal regions have been burdened by renminbi appreciation since 2004 . 
When the economic slowdown hastened the relocation of many manufacturers to inland provinces or neighboring countries , those in the coastal regions began to call for increased openness , deeper structural reforms , and industrial upgrading . 
The view that Li will tolerate slower growth only above a particular threshold is based on the belief that GDP growth below 8 % would hurt economic development more than it helped , and lead to social instability . 
And , indeed , if unemployment pressure had become as acute today as it was in the 1990 &quot; s , the prolonged economic slowdown would undoubtedly have precipitated government intervention . 
But , over the last decade , structural changes to China &apos;s economy have caused unemployment pressure to decline significantly - a trend that can be corroborated by across-the-board wage increases . 
Now , the setting is very favorable to build the stronger , more stable economy that Li wants - and that China needs .
