The People &apos;s Corporations 
LONDON - Two big power shifts are occurring around the world today . 
First , corporate power is growing relative to that of governments . 
Second , ordinary people are also gaining greater influence . 
What does it mean that these seemingly contradictory shifts are happening simultaneously ? 
There is , no doubt , more power in the hands of companies than ever before . 
People who have not been popularly elected control more and more of our daily lives - from entertainment and energy supplies to schools , railways , and postal services . 
At the same time , the speed of technological innovation is outpacing that of legislation , meaning that corporate activities are routinely entering seemingly gray areas devoid of regulation . 
But , counterbalancing this trend , people now have the means and opportunities to ensure that companies &quot; behavior does not go unchecked . 
The public increasingly acts as the conscience of companies and industries , asking hard questions and holding them to account . 
In the past several years , more effective means of collective action - such as social media , open publishing platforms , and online video sharing - have given people more levers to pull . 
As people pursue boycotts and disinvestment , lobby for legislation , and activate social-media campaigns with growing sophistication , they are increasingly able to influence companies &quot; operational and strategic decision-making , thereby imposing checks and balances on today &apos;s enormous accretions of private power . 
For some companies , this has come as a thunderbolt . 
Consider the British Petroleum oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 . 
The BP spill was one of the first instances in which companies were forced to contend with the power of social media - and in which people realized the potential of the tools at their disposal . 
Like most companies at the time , BP was accustomed to communicating with traditional seats of power - the White House , the Kremlin , and so on - and to doing so via traditional modes of communication , such as briefing carefully selected journalists and distributing precisely worded press releases . 
The Gulf oil spill changed all of that . 
Communities united around an issue and found a voice on Facebook . 
There was a massive conversation going on , and BP was neither a part of it nor able to control it via traditional communication-management methods . 
Since then , there has been a marked increase in this sort of direct action . 
Social media spread ideas in an immediate and unfettered manner . 
A document , an image , or a video is shared , and suddenly what was secret or shielded is globally exposed . 
And , though wrong or false information spreads just as quickly as true information , corrections are often swift as well . 
For younger people today , using social media as a tool for activism is second nature . 
They are fluent in using YouTube , Twitter , Facebook , and Reddit to communicate and create a community around an idea , issue , or objection - and to nurture the growth of a small group into a mass movement . 
And older people are not far behind . 
As corporate power rises , holding companies to account becomes increasingly important . 
The scope of accountability must expand as well , in order to affect the behavior of executives and non-executives alike . 
With all of that comes a culture of questioning that which was previously unquestioned - including how companies are run and whether an organization &apos;s actions are ethical . 
Any action can be questioned by anyone , and if others find it interesting or important , the question will spread - and not just within a small community or a specialist group , but more broadly and around the world . 
This shift has changed the nature of activism and collective action . 
Likewise , those who in other circumstances might see activist investors as natural adversaries can agree with the positions that they take , such as concerns about executive compensation or corporate social responsibility . 
Activist investors can write open letters that may not be picked up by mainstream media outlets , but that can go viral on Twitter or Reddit . 
Corporate leaders who embrace this new reality , view it as an opportunity , and resist the inclination to &quot; manage &quot; or avoid issues will have a competitive advantage . 
They will not regard meeting people where they are as a way to manipulate them , but as an opportunity to hear what they are saying . 
Their first impulse will not be to figure out how to use modern means of direct communication to persuade customers , employees , and other stakeholders to think and do the things that they want them to think and do . 
Companies make our cars , our phones , and our children &apos;s textbooks - and exercise increasing control over the daily lives and destinies of people worldwide , not only those who use their products , but also those who work for them and those who live in the communities where they are based . 
If companies do not take seriously the responsibility that comes with their great and growing power , people will be there to remind them .
