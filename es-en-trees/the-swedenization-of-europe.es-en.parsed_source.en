The Swedenization of Europe Anti-Semitism , anti-Zionism , and anti-Americanism are becoming linked and ever more rabid in today &apos;s Europe . 
They arise from a kind of blindness , combined with a strange mixture of alienation , guilt , and fear toward both Israel and America . 
Millions of Europeans resist seeing Israel as a country fighting for its survival . 
Israel cannot afford to lose one major war , as it would mean the end of the Jewish democratic state . 
But huge numbers of Europeans believe that something is fundamentally wrong with the Israelis : they never compromise ; they prefer using military means to solve political problems . 
Something similar is at work in the European attitude to the US . 
We created a peaceful European Union . 
We do not wage war ; we negotiate . 
We do not exhaust our resources on weapons . 
The rest of the planet should learn from us how to live together without terrorizing each other . 
As a Swede , I have heard such pacific boasting all my life : that neutral Sweden is a moral superpower . 
Now this bragging has become the EU &apos;s ideology . 
We are the moral continent . 
Call this the &quot; Swedenization &quot; of Europe . 
Yes , today &apos;s EU is a miracle for a continent where two modern totalitarian movements - Communism and Nazism - unleashed rivers of blood . 
But what Europe forgets is how those ideologies were overcome . 
Without the US Army , Western Europe would not have been liberated in 1945 . 
Without the Marshall Plan and NATO , it would not have taken off economically . 
Without the policy of containment under America &apos;s security umbrella , the Red Army would have strangled the dream of freedom in Eastern Europe , or brought European unity , but under a flag with red stars . 
West Europeans also forget that some areas of the world have never known freedom . 
In many places , torture chambers are the rules of the game , not the grotesque and shameful mistakes of ill-supervised troops . 
Any attempt in such places to go behave the European way and negotiate - without the military power needed to back up diplomacy - would be pathetic . 
Instead of supporting those who fight international terrorism , many Europeans try to blame the spread of terrorism on Israel and the US . 
This is a new European illusion . 
Spain &apos;s latter day appeasement Ã  la Munich arises from this thinking . 
But what if Spain - and Europe as a whole - had reacted in the opposite way to the Madrid train bombing of April , saying : &quot; We promise that because of that slaughter we will double our support for stabilization in Iraq by sending twice as many troops , experts , engineers , teachers , policemen , doctors , and billions of euros in support of allied forces and their Iraqi co-workers . &quot; 
The triumph of terrorists would have been transformed into a triumph of the war on terror . 
The images many Europeans hold of America and Israel create the political climate for some very ugly bias . 
You have the Great Satan and the Small Satan . 
America wants to dominate the world - exactly the allegations made in traditional anti-Semitic rhetoric about the Jews . 
Indeed , modern anti-Zionist rhetoric portrays Israel &apos;s goal as domination of the whole Middle East . 
Such ideas are reflected in opinions polls in which Europeans claim that Israel and the US are the true dangers to world peace . 
Ian Buruma , the British writer , claims that this European rage against America and Israel has to do with guilt and fear . 
The two world wars led to such catastrophic carnage that &quot; never again &quot; was interpreted as &quot; welfare at home , non-intervention abroad . &quot; 
The problem with this concept is that it could only survive under the protection of American might . 
Extreme anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism are actually merging . 
The so-called peace poster &quot; Hitler Had Two Sons : Bush and Sharon , &quot; displayed in European anti-war rallies , combines trivialization of Nazism with demonization of both the victims of Nazism and those who defeated Nazism . 
Much of this grows from a subconscious European guilt related to the Holocaust . 
Now the Holocaust &apos;s victims - and their children and grandchildren - are supposedly doing to others what was done to them . 
By equating the murderer and the victim , we wash our hands . 
This pattern of anti-Zionism and anti-Americanism returns again and again . 
&quot; The ugly Israeli &quot; and &quot; the ugly American &quot; seem to be of the same family . 
&quot; The ugly Jew &quot; becomes the instrumental part of this defamation when so-called neoconservatives are blamed both for American militarism and Israeli brutalities and then selectively named : Wolfowitz , Perle , Abrams , Kristol , etc . 
Earlier this year , the editor of Die Zeit , Josef Joffe , put his finger on the issue : like Jews , Americans are said to be selfish and arrogant . 
Like Jews , they are in thrall to a fundamentalist religion that renders them self-righteous and dangerous . 
Like Jews , Americans are money-grabbing capitalists , for whom the highest value is the cash nexus . 
&quot; America and Israel are the outsiders - just as Jews have been all the way into the 21st century , &quot; Joffe says . 
The links between anti-Semitism , anti-Zionism , and anti-Americanism are all too real . 
Unless Europe &apos;s leaders roundly condemn this unholy triple alliance , it will poison Middle East politics and transatlantic relations alike .
