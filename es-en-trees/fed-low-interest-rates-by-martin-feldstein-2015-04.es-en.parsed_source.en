America &apos;s Risky Recovery 
CAMBRIDGE - The United States &quot; economy is approaching full employment and may already be there . 
The overall unemployment rate is down to just 5.5 % , and the unemployment rate among college graduates is just 2.5 % . 
The increase in inflation that usually occurs when the economy reaches such employment levels has been temporarily postponed by the decline in the price of oil and by the 20 % rise in the value of the dollar . 
The stronger dollar not only lowers the cost of imports , but also puts downward pressure on the prices of domestic products that compete with imports . 
Inflation is likely to begin rising in the year ahead . 
The return to full employment reflects the Federal Reserve &apos;s strategy of &quot; unconventional monetary policy &quot; - the combination of massive purchases of long-term assets known as quantitative easing and its promise to keep short-term interest rates close to zero . 
The low level of all interest rates that resulted from this policy drove investors to buy equities and to increase the prices of owner-occupied homes . 
As a result , the net worth of American households rose by $ 10 trillion in 2013 , leading to increases in consumer spending and business investment . 
After a very slow initial recovery , real GDP began growing at annual rates of more than 4 % in the second half of 2013 . 
Consumer spending and business investment continued at that rate in 2014 ( except for the first quarter , owing to the weather-related effects of an exceptionally harsh winter ) . 
That strong growth raised employment and brought the economy to full employment . 
But the Fed &apos;s unconventional monetary policies have also created dangerous risks to the financial sector and the economy as a whole . 
The very low interest rates that now prevail have driven investors to take excessive risks in order to achieve a higher current yield on their portfolios , often to meet return obligations set by pension and insurance contracts . 
This reaching for yield has driven up the prices of all long-term bonds to unsustainable levels , narrowed credit spreads on corporate bonds and emerging-market debt , raised the relative prices of commercial real estate , and pushed up the stock market &apos;s price-earnings ratio to more than 25 % higher than its historic average . 
The low-interest-rate environment has also caused lenders to take extra risks in order to sustain profits . 
Banks and other lenders are extending credit to lower-quality borrowers , to borrowers with large quantities of existing debt , and as loans with fewer conditions on borrowers ( so-called &quot; covenant-lite loans &quot; ) . 
Moreover , low interest rates have created a new problem : liquidity mismatch . 
Favorable borrowing costs have fueled an enormous increase in the issuance of corporate bonds , many of which are held in bond mutual funds or exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) . 
These funds &quot; investors believe - correctly - that they have complete liquidity . 
They can demand cash on a day &apos;s notice . 
It is not clear who the buyers will be , especially since the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation restricted what banks can do and increased their capital requirements , which has raised the cost of holding bonds . 
Although there is talk about offsetting these risks with macroprudential policies , no such policies exist in the US , except for the increased capital requirements that have been imposed on commercial banks . 
There are no policies to reduce risks in shadow banks , insurance companies , or mutual funds . 
So that is the situation that the Fed now faces as it considers &quot; normalizing &quot; monetary policy . 
Some members of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC , the Fed &apos;s policymaking body ) therefore fear that raising the short-term federal funds rate will trigger a substantial rise in longer-term rates , creating losses for investors and lenders , with adverse effects on the economy . 
Others fear that , even without such financial shocks , the economy &apos;s current strong performance will not continue when interest rates are raised . 
And still other FOMC members want to hold down interest rates in order to drive the unemployment rate even lower , despite the prospects of accelerating inflation and further financial-sector risks . 
But , in the end , the FOMC members must recognize that they cannot postpone the increase in interest rates indefinitely , and that once they begin to raise the rates , they must get the real ( inflation-adjusted ) federal funds rate to 2 % relatively quickly . 
My own best guess is that they will start to raise rates in September , and that the federal funds rate will reach 3 % by some point in 2017 .
