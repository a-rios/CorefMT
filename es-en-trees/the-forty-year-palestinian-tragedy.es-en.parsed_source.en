The Forty-Year Palestinian Tragedy 
Forty years ago , Israel captured the West Bank , Gaza , and the Golan Heights after a lightning six-day war that repelled the armies of Egypt , Jordan , and Syria . 
Today , ending the occupation of Palestinian territories that began that June seems as distant a dream as ever . 
The Somalia-like chaos and civil war that is now unfolding in Gaza as a result of this decades-old stalemate can be blamed partly on ill-conceived Israeli policies , and partly on an American administration that , for six long years , relegated the cause of Israeli-Palestinian peace to the bottom of its agenda . 
But it is misleading to attribute the failure of the Palestinians to develop an orderly system of self-government only to the pernicious effects of Israeli occupation and American policies . 
The Palestinian crisis is first and foremost one of leadership . 
True , Yasser Arafat was not a model democrat , but his charisma and political acumen were crucial for holding all the Palestinian factions together . 
Now , not even Fatah , Arafat &apos;s own party , can claim to be a coherent organization . 
Hamas &quot; electoral victory in January 2006 was to a large extent due to Fatah &apos;s fragmentation under Arafat &apos;s successor , Mahmoud Abbas . 
With no effective central authority to inspire fear or respect and the PLO devoid of legitimacy precisely because of its refusal to give Hamas its rightful share in the organization , a grotesquely ineffective brand of &quot; cohabitation &quot; between a Fatah president and a Hamas prime minister has emerged . 
As a result , Palestinian politics has degenerated into a naked struggle for the spoils of power . 
Last February &apos;s Mecca agreement , which created the Fatah-Hamas unity government , was supposed to establish a civilized system of power-sharing . 
The current flare-up is largely due to the fact that Fatah , encouraged by the international community &apos;s boycott of Hamas , never really accepted its electoral defeat and Hamas &apos;s right to govern . 
Moreover , since Hamas &apos;s rise to power , Fatah &apos;s challenge to the new Palestinian rulers was enhanced by lavish financial support it secured from the United States and Europe , and by a generous supply of weapons from both the US and Arab countries . 
Thus , the current conflict is essentially a pre-emptive war by Hamas - aggravated by lawlessness and banditry , clashing free-lance militias , tribes , and families , and a spiral of senseless massacres - to prevent Fatah from being turned by the international community into a formidable challenger to its democratic right to govern . 
For Hamas , this is a life-and-death struggle . 
It has not shrunk from bombarding Abbas &apos;s presidential compound , attacking Fatah &apos;s command centers , and targeting Fatah military leaders like Rashid Abu Shbak , the commander of Fatah &apos;s internal security and many others , all of them lieutenants of the supreme Fatah military authority in the Gaza strip , Mohamed Dahlan . 
Hamas &apos;s determination to assert its authority can be gauged by the desecrated corpses of Fatah fighters , many of them with bullets fired at their heads , a practice dubbed &quot; confirmation of death . &quot; 
The rocket attacks against Israeli territory are a transparent attempt to divert attention and rally the masses around Hamas as the true champions of the Palestinian cause . 
Tragically , all this is not only about human victims , but also about the Palestinians &quot; political horizon . 
Three times in their history - in 1937,1947 , and 2000 - the Palestinians were offered a state , and three times their leaders failed to meet the challenge - admittedly never an easy one for a nation built on such an unwavering ethos of dispossession . 
Today , when America finally understands how vital an Israeli-Palestinian peace is for its fortunes in the broader Middle East , and the Arab world is for the first time committed to pursuing a comprehensive settlement with Israel , anarchic Palestinian politics is making a decision for peace well nigh impossible . 
However vibrant , Israel &apos;s democracy is not exactly manageable or predictable , either . 
But although Prime Minister Ehud Olmert might seek to regain his popular credibility by a major new peace demarche , the two-headed Palestinian Authority , always a dubious partner in the eyes of the Israelis , is now more suspect than ever . 
&quot; Every day that goes by only causes more people to wish for the renewal of the Israeli occupation of Gaza . 
Let the Jews come already and save us ! &quot; 
But that despairing hope , uttered by a desperate Gazan , will not materialize . 
Israel will avoid at all costs a large ground incursion . 
Yet , engaged in a war driven by fury and vengeance , the Israelis are now focused again on a manhunt for gang chieftains , targeted killings of Hamas squads , and the arrest of its political leaders , not on peace overtures . 
Only a dramatic move by external powers can still save Gaza from becoming a second Mogadishu and both Palestinians and Israelis from a total war that would only breed more rage and desperation . 
For the building blocks of a renewed peace process to be sustainable , an international force must be deployed along Gaza &apos;s border with Egypt to prevent the constant smuggling of weapons and isolate the conflict . 
Simultaneously , the international community must help make the unity government work by recognizing Hamas &quot; right to govern in exchange for a performance-based stability plan .
