Fads , Frenzies , and Finance 
Barcelona - The financial crisis , credit crunch , and ensuing economic downturn have severely damaged the credibility of financial markets , institutions , and traders . 
More and more people are claiming that markets are characterized by irrationality , bubbles , fads , and frenzies , and that economic actors are driven by behavioral biases . 
George Soros &apos;s recent book on the credit crisis is a good example of this line of thinking . 
He even suggests that established financial theory is obsolete . 
His view , in essence , means that the current financial crisis is the final proof that markets do not process information efficiently . 
If this is true , we are closer to John Maynard Keynes &apos;s view of the market as a casino than to Friedrich von Hayek &apos;s view of it as a marvelous mechanism for processing dispersed information . 
For example , the recent spike in oil prices would have been driven by an irrational frenzy in futures markets . 
Market operators would have miscalculated systematically , been overconfident about their information , and overreacted to news . 
I believe , however , that there is another explanation for these phenomena , which is based on rational calculation and information processing by institutions and traders . 
The problems we see in the financial markets have very much to do with lack of good information , misaligned incentives , and , in fact , rational responses to the environment . 
When information is scarce and unevenly distributed , prices may well depart from the reality of fundamentals . 
We see this when new technologies arrive on the scene . 
The Internet bubble is the most recent example , but a similar phenomenon occurred with the construction of railways more than a century ago . 
It can be argued that the sophisticated loan packages created by banks in recent years are , likewise , a new and unknown product , so information and experience to aid pricing has been scarce and dispersed . 
In such circumstances , prices may well move far from the fundamentals as assessed by a hypothetical collective wisdom that would pool all information in the market . 
Trading on the momentum of price movements may then become a rational activity that becomes self-fulfilling , as investors decide to &quot; ride the bubble &quot; while it lasts . 
The bubble is inflated further by the asymmetry between those who bet that prices will rise and buy , and those who forecast a fall , but stay out because to sell short is too costly . 
This means that important and relatively persistent departures of prices from fundamental values are possible , and even likely , when information is dispersed - but that a correction to align them with reality will always follow . 
Eventually , stock prices do reflect the fundamentals of the economy . 
This explains why the market can look like Keynes &apos;s casino in the short term and like Hayek &apos;s marvel in the long term . 
So how does this explain the overexposure of many institutions to sub-prime mortgage risk and the collapse of the interbank market ? 
Were banks that chose to securitize sub-prime loans instead of keeping them on their balance sheets behaving irrationally ? 
Again , informational asymmetries and misaligned incentives are at the heart of what happened . 
Keeping those loans on the books would have meant that a bank would have had to incur a large capital adequacy provision and monitor the loans &quot; performance , at a cost to itself . 
Securitization avoided such costs and placed the new product advantageously - with the complicity of rating agencies , which stood to profit from investors &quot; inexperience and lack of information . 
Executives collected generous bonuses , and equity holders were protected by limited liability . 
A probable cause of the collapse of the interbank market is precisely informational failure . 
This is a well-known phenomenon ; indeed the study of the market for automotive &quot; lemons &quot; won George Akerlof the Nobel Prize . 
Banks still don &apos;t trust each other , since each wonders how many skeletons the other has in its closet . 
There is no irrationality here . 
The debate over the irrationality of financial markets is no mere academic argument . 
If we believe that economic actors are irrational , then we will enact paternalistic policies aimed at controlling behavior or bailing out failed agents and institutions , which could be self-defeating and even dangerous . 
The calls to curb speculation in derivatives markets or short sales have this flavor . 
If , on the other hand , we believe that economic actors will respond rationally to incentives and information , then we can usefully reform regulatory frameworks with well-targeted measures , including restrictions on off-balance sheet vehicles , tougher disclosure requirements , and controls on rating agencies &quot; conflicts of interests .
