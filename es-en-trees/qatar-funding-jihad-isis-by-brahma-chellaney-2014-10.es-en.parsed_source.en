Qatar &apos;s Jihad 
ABU DHABI - Qatar may be tiny , but it is having a major impact across the Arab world . 
By propping up violent jihadists in the Middle East , North Africa , and beyond , while supporting the United States in its fight against them , this gas-rich speck of a country - the world &apos;s wealthiest in per capita terms - has transformed itself from a regional gadfly into an international rogue elephant . 
Using its vast resources , and driven by unbridled ambition , Qatar has emerged as a hub for radical Islamist movements . 
The massive , chandeliered Grand Mosque in Doha - Qatar &apos;s opulent capital - is a rallying point for militants heading to wage jihad in places as diverse as Yemen , Tunisia , and Syria . 
As a result , Qatar now rivals Saudi Arabia - another Wahhabi state with enormous resource wealth - in exporting Islamist extremism . 
But there are important differences between Qatar and Saudi Arabia . 
Qatar &apos;s Wahhabism is less severe than Saudi Arabia &apos;s ; for example , Qatari women are allowed to drive and to travel alone . 
In Qatar , there is no religious police enforcing morality , even if Qatari clerics openly raise funds for militant causes overseas . 
Given this , it is perhaps unsurprising that , whereas Saudi Arabia &apos;s sclerotic leadership pursues reactionary policies rooted in a puritanical understanding of Islam , Qatar &apos;s younger royals have adopted a forward-thinking approach . 
Qatar is the home of the Al Jazeera satellite television channel and Education City , a district outside of Doha that accommodates schools , universities , and research centers . 
Similar inconsistencies are reflected in Qatar &apos;s foreign policy . 
Indeed , the country &apos;s relationship with the United States directly contradicts its links with radical Islamist movements . 
Qatar hosts Al Udeid air base - with its 8,000 American military personnel and 120 aircraft , including supertankers for in-flight refueling - from which the US directs its current airstrikes in Syria and Iraq . 
Camp As-Sayliyah - another facility for which Qatar charges no rent - serves as the US Central Command &apos;s forward headquarters . 
In July , Qatar agreed to purchase $ 11 billion worth of US arms . 
To facilitate the negotiations , Qatar provided a home , with US support , to the Taliban &apos;s de facto diplomatic mission - and to the five Afghan Taliban leaders released earlier this year from US detention at Guant√°namo Bay . 
In other words , Qatar is an important US ally , a supplier of weapons and funds to Islamists , and a peace broker all at the same time . 
Add to that its position as the world &apos;s largest supplier of liquefied natural gas and the holder of one of its largest sovereign-wealth funds , and it becomes clear that Qatar has plenty of room to maneuver - as well as considerable international clout . 
Germany &apos;s government found that out when it was forced to retract its development minister &apos;s statement that Qatar played a central role in arming and financing the Islamic State . 
Qatar &apos;s growing influence has important implications for the balance of power in the Arab World , especially with regard to the country &apos;s rivalry with Saudi Arabia . 
This competitive dynamic , which surfaced only recently , represents a shift from a long history of working in tandem to export Islamist extremism . 
Both Qatar and Saudi Arabia generously supplied weapons and funds to Sunni extremists in Syria , opening the door for the emergence of the Islamic State . 
Both have bolstered the Afghan Taliban . 
During the 2011 NATO campaign to overthrow Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi , Qatar even deployed ground troops covertly inside Libya . 
Today , however , Qatar and Saudi Arabia are on opposite sides . 
Qatar , along with Turkey , backs grassroots Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots in Gaza , Libya , Egypt , Tunisia , Iraq , and the Levant . 
In this sense , Qatar &apos;s tack has produced a rare schism within the Gulf Cooperation Council , whose members collectively possess nearly half of the world &apos;s oil reserves . 
The proxy competition among rival monarchies , which led some of them to withdraw their ambassadors from Qatar in March , is intensifying violence and instability throughout the region . 
For example , the UAE , with Egyptian assistance , secretly carried out airstrikes in August to stop Qatari-aided Islamist militias from gaining control of the Libyan capital , Tripoli . 
Qatar &apos;s leaders are willing to challenge their neighbors for a simple reason : They believe that the grassroots Islamist movements they support - which , in their view , represent majority political aspirations - eventually will win . 
Anticipating that such groups will increasingly shape Arab politics , displacing strongman regimes , Qatar has set out to empower them . 
In doing so , Qatar is destabilizing several countries and threatening the security of secular democracies far beyond the region . 
For the sake of regional and international security , this elephant must be tamed .
