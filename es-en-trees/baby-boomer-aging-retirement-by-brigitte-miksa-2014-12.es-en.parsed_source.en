It &apos;s All Over Now , Baby Boom 
MUNICH - Carlos Barientos III was born at 6 : 45 on the evening of December 31 , 1964 , a few miles northwest of Honolulu . 
This year , he will turn 50 , quite possibly making him the last member of the US &quot; baby boom &quot; to do so . 
The generation that once seemed to define for the world the energy , excitement , and even irritating nature of youth will officially be &quot; old &quot; - even if , some might say , not entirely grown up . 
The &quot; baby boomers &quot; are the generation that grew up in the United States , in particular , but also in Europe , Canada , Australia , and elsewhere , after World War II , when rapid economic growth was accompanied by rising birth rates . 
Those born during that 19-year period - from 1945 to 1964 - were part of the largest , most prosperous , best-educated and , some might say , most indulged and indulgent generation that the world has ever seen . 
From sex , drugs , and rock &quot; n &quot; roll to the civil rights movements to the dot-com and housing bubbles , for better or worse , the boomer generation has shaped modern society . 
But there are stark differences within the boomer generation . 
Early boomers - beginning with Kathleen Casey-Kirschling , whose birth one second past midnight on New Year &apos;s Day , 1946 , has made her a minor celebrity - grew up surrounded by the hippie counterculture , the music of the Beatles and Bob Dylan , and the Vietnam war . 
By contrast , Barientos and the other boomers of 1964 grew up playing video games and listening to disco music - or , if their tastes were closer to those of Barientos , the heavier sounds of Gary Moore , Thin Lizzy , and Van Halen . 
In fact , Barientos , who owns and runs his own guitar shop with his father , does not readily identify himself as a baby boomer ; he feels closer to the &quot; Generation X &quot; that followed . 
But Barientos &apos;s interests are not all that set him apart from the likes of Casey-Kirschling . 
While many of the early US baby boomers are now comfortably retired , enjoying the benefits of Medicare , Social Security , and tax-free Roth IRA disbursements , Barientos is still in his prime - and concerned about his retirement . 
By 2031 , when Barientos and the rest of the baby boomers are retired , more than 20 % of the US population will be at least 65 years old , compared with only 13 % in 2010 . 
As a result , the old-age dependency ratio ( the number of people aged 65 or over relative to the working-age population ) is set to rise from 1 : 5 to 1 : 3 . 
As Barientos puts it , &quot; It &apos;s not like my dad &apos;s generation , where you worked a job for a certain amount of time , saved some money , and then stopped working . &quot; 
Instead , he explains , &quot; we just do what we can &amp; hellip ; and keep moving forward . &quot; 
Not that Barientos would swap places with his father . 
&quot; I think I &apos;ve been blessed in comparison to previous generations , &quot; he says . 
&quot; Even compared to older members of my generation , I haven &apos;t had to fight for my freedom . 
I didn &apos;t have to go to Vietnam . 
I &apos;ve been able to benefit from the hard work of people before me . &quot; 
Definitions of the post-war baby boom vary by country . 
Barientos &apos;s claim to be the last US boomer rests on Hawaii &apos;s position as America &apos;s most westerly state in a time zone two hours behind the Pacific coast . 
It also means , though , that he lives a life that is somewhat different from that of many of his peers on the mainland . 
&quot; The food , the language , the weather - Hawaii isn &apos;t like the rest of the US , &quot; he notes . 
&quot; The first time I left Hawaii , I was 25 years old . 
I went to Maryland to visit a friend for two weeks and ended up staying five years because I loved it so much . &quot; 
If he had the money , Barientos says he would probably be a &quot; snow bird &quot; - spending summers on the US mainland and winter in Hawaii . 
&quot; There are things I &apos;d like to do with my family that we just can &apos;t do here , such as &#91; going to &#93; museums , amusement parks , or large sporting events . &quot; 
He could not leave permanently , though - there are too many things to enjoy at home . 
&quot; I love the people , the culture - pretty much everything . &quot; 
When Barientos and his family spill out onto the beach to celebrate New Year &apos;s Eve with the whole neighborhood , one of the last things he will think about is his age . 
&quot; I don &apos;t have time to be worrying about that ! &quot; he says . 
What about his status as the last of a generation ? 
&quot; I don &apos;t know whether I &apos;m the last baby boomer or not , &quot; Barientos muses . 
&quot; If there was anyone born in Hawaii later than 6 : 45 on December 31 , 1964 , then they &apos;ve got me beat . 
But , you know what , if it means I get to meet some new people and talk about it , then it &apos;s definitely cool . &quot;
