The Promise and Peril of Global Change 
MUNICH - Panta rhei . 
Everything flows . 
This Greek aphorism often comes to mind when I think of the economic and political changes in my lifetime . 
They seemed as impossible before they occurred as they have felt natural in retrospect . 
Communism fell . 
Germany was united . 
The United States elected a black man president . 
And now we are in a phase in which Asia is catching up with the West and American hegemony is being challenged . 
While American casino capitalism has collapsed , and America &apos;s European economic satellites are suffering , China seems to be taking advantage of the situation , increasing its trade surplus in the midst of the global economic crisis . 
Indeed , in the first four months of this year , China became the world &apos;s leading goods exporter , overtaking Germany , the previous champion . 
It is true that in other economic terms , China still lags far behind . 
Although China accounts for 20 % of the world &apos;s population , its share of global GDP currently is only 7 % . 
By contrast , the United States and the European Union account for 54 % of global GDP , despite having only 12 % of the world &apos;s population . 
But these figures are changing rapidly , owing to China &apos;s exuberant growth . 
From 1995 to 2008 , China &apos;s economy grew by 229 % , while the world economy grew by 63 % , the US by 45 % , and 27-member EU by only 37 % . 
It may be difficult for China to ever match the success of a small Asian country like Singapore , which has already overtaken the US in terms of GDP per capita as measured by purchasing power parity . 
Yet China will undoubtedly become the world &apos;s largest economic power in the foreseeable future . 
To achieve this leadership position , it needs less than a quarter of US per capita GDP , because its population is more than four times larger . 
The forces of globalization that were liberated by the fall of Communism have created a better world , with rapid economic convergence and shrinking inequality . 
The proportion of people living below the World Bank &apos;s poverty line of $ 1.25 a day shrank from 52 % in 1981 to only 25 % in 2005 . 
More than 50 % of the world &apos;s population is now considered middle class , with a living standard above the average of the developed countries &quot; poverty lines ( $ 8.2 at 1996 PPP prices ) . 
And the worldwide Gini coefficient of inter-country inequality fell from 0.653 to 0.556 from 1980 to 2007 , owing largely to the astounding performance of the emerging countries , particularly China and India . 
The development of the world has not been without problems , however . 
Carbon-dioxide emissions have been growing fast , fossil-fuel resources are being depleted rapidly , and global warming has accelerated . 
Even if the US embraces the Kyoto Protocol under President Barack Obama , the world &apos;s temperature will break the record of the last 800,000 years in the next 30 years . 
Moreover , huge waves of migrants from developing countries to OECD countries challenge the assimilation capacity of the latter and deprive the former of its educated work force . 
In the US and Germany , 13 % of the population is foreign born , as are 8 % of France inhabitants and 10 % of Britain &apos;s . 
Unskilled migrants tend to come to Europe , where they burden the welfare state , and skilled migrants are lured to the US , although they are urgently needed at home . 
The brain drain is a problem not only for South America west of the Andes and many African countries , but also for Turkey , Italy , Britain , the Balkan countries , Germany , and Finland . 
Migration from developing countries partly reflects a problem that also triggered the current financial crisis : international capital flowed in the wrong direction . 
In recent years , the US absorbed half the world &apos;s capital exports , while China provided one-fifth of the total . 
In 2007 alone , the US imported $ 790 billion of capital , while the emerging and developing countries exported $ 714 billion . 
This made it possible for US households to stop saving and enjoy an exorbitant consumption level , but it stood on its head the conventional wisdom that capital should flow from rich to poor countries , where it can more productively be invested . 
Since the world will not continue to provide the US with goods in exchange for dubious financial securities , Americans will have to leave their dream world . 
They will have to brace themselves for an extensive period of diminished expectations that will last much longer than the next economic boom , and that will require substantial structural changes in the US economy . 
In the next few decades , the biggest challenge for the world will be peace , because the changing economic power structure will require corresponding political changes , which the US , as the incumbent superpower , will not easily accept . 
The situation is similar to Germany &apos;s challenge to British geopolitical hegemony in the nineteenth century , when the German economy blossomed . 
The resulting political tensions led to a second Thirty Years &quot; War that brought Western civilization to the brink of collapse . 
It can only be hoped that the political leaders who shape the course of the twenty-first century will be wise enough to avoid such an outcome .
