The Case for Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Last fall , the United Kingdom issued a major government report on global climate change directed by Sir Nicholas Stern , a top-flight economist . 
The Stern Review Report on the Economics of Climate Change amounts to a call to action : it argues that huge future costs of global warming can be avoided by incurring relatively modest cost today . 
Critics of the Stern Review don &apos;t think serious action to limit CO2 emissions is justified , because there remains substantial uncertainty about the extent of the costs of global climate change , and because these costs will be incurred far in the future . 
However , I believe that Stern &apos;s fundamental conclusion is justified : we are much better off reducing CO2 emissions substantially than risking the consequences of failing to act , even if , unlike Stern , one heavily discounts uncertainty and the future . 
Two factors differentiate global climate change from other environmental problems . 
First , whereas most environmental insults - for example , water pollution , acid rain , or sulfur dioxide emissions - are mitigated promptly or in fairly short order when the source is cleaned up , emissions of CO2 and other trace gases remain in the atmosphere for centuries . 
So reducing emissions today is very valuable to humanity in the distant future . 
Second , the externality is truly global in scale , because greenhouse gases travel around the world in a few days . 
As a result , the nation-state and its subsidiaries , the typical loci for internalizing externalities , are limited in their remedial capacity . 
( However , since the United States contributes about 25 % of the world &apos;s CO2 emissions , its own policy could make a large difference . ) 
Thus , global climate change is a public good ( bad ) par excellence . 
Cost-benefit analysis is a principal tool for deciding whether altering it through mitigation policy is warranted . 
Two aspects of that calculation are critical . 
First , it has to be assumed that individuals prefer to avoid risk . 
That is , an uncertain outcome is worth less than the average of the outcomes . 
Because the possible outcomes of global warming in the absence of mitigation are very uncertain , though surely bad , the uncertain losses should be evaluated as being equivalent to a single loss greater than the expected loss . 
The second critical aspect is how one treats future outcomes relative to current ones - an issue that has aroused much attention among philosophers as well as economists . 
At what rate should future impacts - particularly losses of future consumption - be discounted to the present ? 
The consumption discount rate should account for the possibility that , as consumption grows , the marginal unit of consumption may be considered to have less social value . 
This is analogous to the idea of diminishing marginal private utility of private consumption , and is relatively uncontroversial , although researchers disagree on its magnitude . 
There is greater disagreement about how much to discount the future simply because it is the future , even if future generations are no better off than us . 
Whereas the Stern Review follows a tradition among British economists and many philosophers against discounting for pure futurity , most economists take pure time preference as obvious . 
However , the case for intervention to keep CO2 levels within bounds ( say , aiming to stabilize them at about 550 ppm ) is sufficiently strong to be insensitive to this dispute . 
Consider some numbers from the Stern Review concerning the future benefits of preventing greenhouse gas concentrations from exceeding 550 ppm , as well as the costs of accomplishing this . 
The benefits are the avoided damages , including both market damages and non-market damages that account for health and ecological impacts . 
Following a &quot; business as usual &quot; policy , by 2200 , the losses in GNP have an expected value of 13.8 % , but with a degree of uncertainty that makes the expected loss equivalent to a certain loss of about 20 % . 
Since the base rate of economic growth ( before calculating the climate change effect ) was taken to be 1.3 % per year , a loss of 20 % in the year 2200 amounts to reducing the annual growth rate to 1.2 % . 
In other words , the benefit of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions can be represented as the increase in the annual growth rate from today to 2200 from 1.2 % to 1.3 % . 
As for the cost of stabilization , estimates in the Stern Review range from 3.4 % of GNP to -3.9 % ( since saving energy reduces energy costs , the latter estimate is not as startling as it appears ) . 
Let &apos;s assume that costs to prevent additional accumulation of CO2 ( and equivalents ) come to 1 % of GNP every year forever , and , in accordance with a fair amount of empirical evidence , that the component of the discount rate attributable to the declining marginal utility of consumption is equal to twice the rate of growth of consumption . 
A straightforward calculation shows that mitigation is better than business as usual - that is , the present value of the benefits exceeds the present value of the costs - for any social rate of time preference less than 8.5 % . 
No estimate of the pure rate of time preference , even by those who believe in relatively strong discounting of the future , has ever approached 8.5 % . 
These calculations indicate that , even with higher discounting , the Stern Review &apos;s estimates of future benefits and costs imply that mitigation makes economic sense . 
These calculations rely on the report &apos;s projected time profiles for benefits and its estimate of annual costs , about which there is much disagreement . 
Still , I believe there can be little serious argument about the importance of a policy aimed at avoiding major further increases in CO2 emissions .
