China on the Move 
BEIJING - The debate is over . 
After six years of weighing the options , China is now firmly committed to implementing a new growth strategy . 
At least , that &apos;s the verdict I gleaned from the just-completed annual China Development Forum , long China &apos;s most important dialogue with the outside world . 
There were no surprises in the basic thrust of the strategy - a structural shift in China &apos;s investment- and export-led growth model toward a more balanced consumer-based and services-led economy . 
The transformation reflects both necessity and design . 
It is necessary because persistently weak global growth is unlikely to provide the solid external demand for Chinese exports that it once did . 
But it is also essential , because China &apos;s new leadership seems determined to come to grips with a vast array of internal imbalances that threaten the environment , promote destabilizing income inequality , and exacerbate regional disparities . 
The strategic shift is also a deliberate effort by Chinese policymakers to avoid the dreaded &quot; middle-income trap &quot; - a mid-stage slowdown that has ensnared most emerging economies when per capita income nears the $ 17,000 threshold ( in constant international prices ) . 
Developing economies that maintain their old growth models for too long fall into it , and China probably will hit the threshold in 3-5 years . 
Three insights from this year &apos;s China Development Forum deepened my confidence that a major structural transformation is now at hand that will enable China to avoid the middle-income trap . 
First , a well-articulated urbanization strategy has emerged as a key pillar of consumer-led rebalancing . 
This was emphasized by China &apos;s new senior leaders - Executive Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli and Premier Li Keqiang - in the Forum &apos;s opening and closing remarks , and considerable detail was provided in many of the working sessions . 
Urbanization is a building block for consumption , because it provides powerful leverage to Chinese households &quot; purchasing power . 
Urban workers &quot; per capita income is more than three times higher than that of their counterparts in the countryside . 
The urban share of the Chinese population reached 52.6 % in 2012 - up nearly three-fold from 18 % in 1980 , and is expected to rise toward 70 % by 2030 . 
If ongoing urbanization can be coupled with job creation - a distinct possibility in light of China &apos;s emphasis on developing its embryonic labor-intensive services sector - the outlook for household-income growth is quite encouraging . 
The pace of urbanization should dispel Western doubts stemming from concerns over so-called ghost cities and chronic over-investment . 
According to research by McKinsey &amp; Company , with the annual influx of new urban residents totaling 15-20 million , China will need more than 220 large cities ( at least one million people ) by 2030 , up from 125 in 2010 . 
Moreover , because urbanization is a capital-intensive endeavor and China &apos;s capital stock per worker - a key driver of productivity growth - is still only 13 % of the levels in the United States and Japan , China has good reason to remain a high-investment economy for years to come . 
What is new today is the focus on urbanization &apos;s negative externalities - especially the thorny issues of land confiscation and environmental degradation . 
A well-developed &quot; eco-city &quot; framework was presented at this year &apos;s Forum to counter both concerns , and features incentives promoting a new urbanization model that stresses compact land usage , mixed modes of local transportation , lighter building materials , and non-carbon energy sources . 
The second insight from the 2013 China Development Forum is the new government &apos;s focus on strengthening the social safety net as a pillar of a modern consumer society . 
In particular , owing to the hukou ( China &apos;s antiquated household registration system ) , access to public services and benefits is not portable . 
As a result , migrant workers - an underclass numbering roughly 160 million - remain shut out of government-supported health care , education , and social security . 
Holes in the social safety net have led to high and rising levels of precautionary saving - driving a wedge between increases in labor income and any impetus to discretionary purchasing power . 
Significantly , there were strong hints from senior Chinese leaders at the Forum that hukou reform is now under active consideration . 
While that would be welcome , such efforts need to be accompanied by an expansion of benefits . 
China &apos;s retirement system has only about $ 430 billion of assets under management ( national and local government social security and private-sector pensions ) . 
I pressed newly appointed Finance Minister Lou Jiwei on this point , suggesting that China deploy some of its excess foreign-exchange reserves to fund such an effort - the same tactic used to provide a $ 200 billion start-up injection for the China Investment Corporation , the sovereign wealth fund that he ran for the previous five and a half years . 
Unfortunately , he did not favor this suggestion . 
The final - and possibly most important - insight that I took away from the Forum concerned the quality of China &apos;s new leaders . 
From President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang on down , China &apos;s new leadership team is quite sophisticated in terms of analytics , risk assessment , scenario modeling , and devising innovative solutions to tough problems . 
Moreover , under the organizational umbrella of the National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) - the latter-day version of the old central planning apparatus - China has marshaled considerable resources into the formulation of a comprehensive and well-thought-out economic strategy . 
But , in the end , it takes more than strong policy and analytical skills to deal with tough economic challenges . 
We have seen unfortunate examples of that repeatedly in the West in recent years , and there are no guarantees that China &apos;s newly installed leaders will avoid comparable pitfalls . 
Vision and strategy are vital for realizing the &quot; China Dream , &quot; as the country &apos;s new leaders are now calling it . 
But it will take courage and sheer determination to tackle what is perhaps the biggest obstacle of all - resistance from deeply entrenched local and provincial power blocs . 
On this critical front , strong words must be accompanied by bold action .
