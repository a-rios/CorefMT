The Decline of the West Revisited 
MADRID - Since the publication in 1918 of the first volume of Oswald Spengler &apos;s The Decline of the West , prophecies about the inexorable doom of what he called the &quot; Faustian Civilization &quot; have been a recurrent topic for thinkers and public intellectuals . 
The current crises in the United States and Europe - the result primarily of US capitalism &apos;s inherent ethical failures , and to Europe &apos;s dysfunction - might be seen as lending credibility to Spengler &apos;s view of democracy &apos;s inadequacy , and to his dismissal of Western civilization as essentially being driven by a corrupting lust for money . 
But determinism in history has always been defeated by the unpredictable forces of human will , and , in this case , by the West &apos;s extraordinary capacity for renewal , even after cataclysmic defeats . 
True , the West is no longer alone in dictating the global agenda , and its values are bound to be increasingly challenged by emerging powers , but its decline is not a linear , irreversible process . 
There can be no doubt that the West &apos;s military mastery and economic edge have been severely diminished recently . 
In 2000 , America &apos;s GDP was eight times larger than China &apos;s ; today it is only twice as large . 
Worse , appalling income inequalities , a squeezed middle class , and evidence of widespread ethical lapses and impunity are fueling a dangerous disenchantment with democracy and a growing loss of trust in a system that has betrayed the American dream of constant progress and improvement . 
This would not be , however , the first time that America &apos;s values prevailed over the threat of populism in times of economic crisis . 
A variation of the fascist agenda once appeared in America , with Father Charles Coughlin &apos;s populist onslaught in the 1930 &quot; s on Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s &quot; alliance with the bankers . &quot; 
Coughlin &apos;s National Union for Social Justice , whose membership ran into the millions , was eventually defeated by the American system &apos;s powerful democratic antibodies . 
As for Europe , the eurozone crisis has exposed democracy &apos;s weaknesses in dealing with major economic emergencies , as well as the flaws in the European Union &apos;s design . 
In Greece and Italy , technocratic governments have taken over from failing politicians . 
In Hungary , Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n has pressed for an authoritarian &quot; re-establishment of the state . &quot; 
Such cases seem to point to the return of a European past in which democracy &apos;s failures gave way to more &quot; expedient &quot; forms of government . 
And yet , while Europe remains a question mark , economic growth and job creation , however fragile , are back in America . 
Moreover , even if China becomes the world &apos;s largest economy in , say , 2018 , Americans would still be far richer than Chinese , with per capita GDP in America four times higher than in China . 
To be sure , income inequality and social injustice are a concomitant of capitalist culture throughout the West . 
Compared to Indian capitalism , capitalism &apos;s ethical failures elsewhere look especially benign . 
A hundred oligarchs in India hold assets equivalent to 25 % of GDP , while 800 million of their compatriots survive on less than a dollar a day . 
Politicians and judges are bought , and natural resources worth trillions of dollars are sold to powerful corporations for a pittance . 
Having the largest economy is vital for a power aspiring to maintain military superiority and the ability to define the international order . 
Hence , the receding power of the West means a tougher fight to uphold the relevance of key components of its value system , such as democracy and universal rights . 
Europe , with its almost post-historical mentality , has long abandoned the pretension of being a military power . 
The same cannot be said of the US . 
The recent massive cuts to the US military budget need not signal decline ; they can launch an age of smarter defense , one that relies on innovative ideas , strong alliances , and building partners &quot; capacity . 
The shift of US military priorities to the Asia-Pacific region is an understandable strategic rebalancing , given America &apos;s excessive focus on the Middle East and its maintenance of an unnecessary military presence in Europe . 
Tempered by the US public &apos;s fatigue with overseas adventures , America &apos;s missionary zeal to save the world from the wickedness of faraway autocrats will be reduced substantially . 
Despite the recent cuts , America &apos;s defense budget is still five times higher than China &apos;s . 
More importantly , China &apos;s long-term strategy requires that it focus in the short term on satisfying its vast appetite for energy and raw materials . 
Make no mistake : Euro-centrism and Western hubris have been dealt severe blows in recent years . 
Nor has the inconsistency between China &apos;s capitalism and its lack of civil liberties been resolved yet . 
A Chinese Spring cannot be ruled out . 
The West faces serious challenges - as it always has .
