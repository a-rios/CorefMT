Progressive Realism 
Polls in the United States show low public approval for President George W. Bush &apos;s handling of foreign policy , but little agreement on what should take its place . 
The unbridled ambitions of the neo-conservatives and assertive nationalists in his first administration produced a foreign policy that was like a car with an accelerator , but no brakes . 
It was bound to go off the road . 
But how should America use its unprecedented power , and what role should values play ? 
Realists warn against letting values determine policy , but democracy and human rights have been an inherent part of American foreign policy for two centuries . 
The Democratic Party could solve this problem by adopting the suggestion of Robert Wright and others that it pursue &quot; progressive realism . &quot; 
What would go into a progressive realist foreign policy ? A progressive realist foreign policyIt would start with an understanding of the strength and limits of American power . 
The US is the only superpower , but preponderance is not empire or hegemony . 
America can influence but not control other parts of the world . 
Power always depends upon context , and the context of world politics today is like a three-dimensional chess game . 
The top board of military power is unipolar ; but on the middle board of economic relations , the world is multipolar . , and 
Military power is a small part of the solution in responding to these new threats on the bottom board of international relations . 
They require cooperation among governments and international institutions . 
Even on the top board ( where America represents nearly half of world defense expenditures ) , the military is supreme in the global commons of air , sea , and space , but more limited in its ability to control nationalistic populations in occupied areas . 
A progressive realist policy would also stress the importance of developing an integrated grand strategy that combines &quot; hard &quot; military power with &quot; soft &quot; attractive power into &quot; smart &quot; power of the sort that won the Cold War . 
America needs to use hard power against terrorists , but it cannot hope to win the struggle against terrorism unless it gains the hearts and minds of moderates . 
The mis-use of hard power ( as at Abu Ghraib or Haditha ) produces new terrorist recruits . 
Today , the US has no such integrated strategy for combining hard and soft power . 
Many official instruments of soft power - public diplomacy , broadcasting , exchange programs , development assistance , disaster relief , military to military contacts - are scattered around the government , and there is no overarching strategypolicy , much less ora common budget , that even tries to integrate combine them with hard power into a national coherent security strategy . 
The US spends about roughly 500 times more on the its military than it does on broadcasting and exchanges . 
Is this the right proportion ? 
And how should the government relate to the non-official generators of soft power - everything from Hollywood to Harvard to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  - - that emanates from civil society ? 
A progressive realist policy must advance the promise of &quot; life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness &quot; enshrined in American tradition . 
Such a grand strategy would have four key pillars : ( 1 ) providing security for the US and its allies ; ( 2 ) maintaining a strong domestic and international economy ; ( 3 ) avoiding environmental disasters ( such as pandemics and global flooding ) ; and ( 4 ) encouraging liberal democracy and human rights at home and , where feasible , abroad where feasible . 
This does not mean imposing American values by force . 
Democracy promotion is better accomplished by attraction than coercion , and it takes time and patience . 
The US would be wise to encourage the gradual evolution of democracy , but in a manner that accepts the reality of cultural diversity . 
Such a grand strategy would focus on four major threats . 
Probably the greatest danger is the intersection of terrorism with nuclear materials . 
Preventing this requires policies for to counteringfight terrorism and promote , non-proliferation , better protection of nuclear materials , stability in the Middle East , as well as greater nd attention to failed states . 
The second major challenge would be is the rise of a hostile hegemon as Asia &apos;s gradually regains the three-fifths share of the world economy that correspondsgradually comes to match its three-fifths share of the world &apos;s population . 
This requires a policy that integrates China as a responsible global stakeholder , but hedges against possible hostility its bets by maintaining close relations with Japan , India , and other countries in the region . 
The third major threat would be is an economic depression , that could be possibly triggered by financial mismanagement , or by a crisis that disrupts global access to oil flows from the Persian Gulf - home towhere two-thirds of global world oil reserves are located . 
This will require policies that gradually reduce dependence on oil , while realizing that it will not be possible recognizing to isolatethat the American economy cannot be isolated from global energy markets . 
The fourth major threat is ecological breakdowns , such as pandemics and negative climate change . 
A progressive realist policy should look to the long-term evolution of world order and realize the responsibility of the international system &apos;s most powerfullargest country in the international system to produce global public or common goods . 
In the nineteenth19th century , Britain defined its national interest broadly to include promoting freedom of the seas , an open international economy , and a stable European balance of power . 
Such common goods benefited both helped Britain , but and benefited other countries as well . 
They also contributed to Britain &apos;s legitimacy and soft power . 
As the largest country of the 21st century , With the US now in Britain &apos;s place , it should play a similar role by should similarly promotingte an open international economy and commons ( seas , space , iInternet ) , mediateing international disputes before they escalate , and developing international rules and institutions . 
Because globalization will spread technical capabilities , and information technology will allow broader participation in global communications , American preponderance will become less dominant later this century . 
Progressive realism requires America to prepare for that future by defining its national interest in a way that benefits all .
