The Islamic State &apos;s Perversion of Hijra 
LONDON - In recent decades , the Arabic word jihad - once used to describe the duty of all Muslims to act according to their faith - has become overwhelmingly associated with the waging of violent war against non-believers . 
With the rise of the Islamic State , another term has been refashioned for inclusion in the lexicon of extremist violence : hijra . 
As with jihad , this is no mere semantic hijacking . 
The real-world implications are all too alarming . 
By militarizing the concept of hijra , which traditionally referred to Muslims &quot; peaceful migration to lands where they would be free from persecution , they have created a powerful tool for radicalizing and recruiting Muslims far and wide , including in the United States and Europe . 
Hijra &apos;s association with Islam has its origins in the Prophet Mohammed &apos;s escape from Mecca to Medina in 622 , to avoid assassination and preserve his community . 
He and his followers knew that as long as they remained in Mecca , they would be despised by non-Muslims ; their very lives were in danger . 
And so , in an act of hijra - or migration - the prophet left the city of his birth . 
Islam would have a stable base , because Muslims in Medina would be free to worship according to the dictates of their faith . 
Mohammed &apos;s hijra is not narrated in the Koran , but the sacred book is structured around the event , divided into revelations he received in Mecca and those he received in Medina . 
The year of Mohammed &apos;s hijra also became the first year of the Islamic calendar . 
And , as the faith spread , the word came to describe not only Mohammed &apos;s departure for Medina , but also a general obligation by all Muslims to migrate to lands under Muslim rule when it will serve their faith . 
Over the course of Islamic history , hijra has come to represent more than physical movement ; it is widely viewed as an injunction to create a better world in lands under Muslim rule . 
For millions of Muslims , it has been a guide to the universal predicament faced by all believers : how to be pious in an impious world . 
At its most meaningful , hijra bridges the gap between how believers wish they lived and how they actually do live . 
In early modernity , however , with the systematic expulsion of Muslims from Spain in 1492 , and later from lands seized by other colonial empires , hijra acquired a more violent meaning that anticipated its later association with jihad . 
Following these expulsions - most notably by the Spanish and Russian Empires - the concept came to signify not only the pressure to migrate , as during Mohammed &apos;s lifetime , but also an ultimatum from the state : leave or you will be slaughtered . 
Centuries after these violent expulsions by European powers , hijra today signifies much more than physical relocation . 
For many modern Muslims , hijra represents the perpetual movement between memory and forgetting . 
It is what Muslims do when - like Palestinians and Chechens- they have been dispossessed by more powerful states . 
It is how they create homes amid the homelessness of exile and displacement that is part of their modern condition . 
It is the turn to narrative to keep the past - and oneself - alive in the present . 
Wherever and whenever in Islamic history there are stories of despair and loss , hijra emerges as a path to courage and spiritual victory . 
It is both a beginning - an origin story - and a denouement to trauma . 
Most recently , however , under the Islamic State , hijra has acquired a connotation that alienates it from its prior meanings . 
The Islamic State can only understand hijra as physical migration for the purpose of jihad . 
For the Islamic State &apos;s crude and contrived medievalism , the past is of only instrumental value , to be refashioned in the service of violent conquest and savage repression . 
Far from being an ethical mode of remembering - a source of cultural continuity and consolation - hijra has been turned into a call to arms by this new self-proclaimed Caliphate , which the vast majority of Muslims today do not recognize as part of their religion . 
Before hijra became militarized , it was used to hold the present accountable to the past . 
In this richer , if more elusive , sense , hijra far exceeds - indeed , confounds - the Islamic State &apos;s remit . 
The word &apos;s original evocation of the early Islamic community of believers who had to migrate not to wage war , but rather to live in peace , are nuances that the group &apos;s ideologues - whose appeals to the force of the new require a purified version of the past - would very much like us to forget .
