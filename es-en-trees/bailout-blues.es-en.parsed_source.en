Bailout Blues 
NEW YORK - It doesn &apos;t take a genius to figure out that the United States &quot; financial system - indeed , global finance - is in a mess . 
And now , with the US House of Representatives having rejected the Bush administration &apos;s proposed $ 700 billion bailout plan , it is also obvious that there is no consensus on how to fix it . 
The problems in the US economy and financial system have been apparent for years . 
But that didn &apos;t prevent America &apos;s leaders from turning to the same people who helped create the mess , who didn &apos;t see the problems until they brought us to the brink of another Great Depression , and who have been veering from one bail-out to another , to rescue us . 
As global markets plummet , some version of the rescue plan will almost certainly be put to another vote in Congress . Unless the plan is markedly different from the current one , while it may help Wall Street , what about the economy ? 
What about taxpayers , already beleaguered by unprecedented deficits , and with bills still to pay for decaying infrastructure and two wars ? 
In such circumstances , is there any bailout plan that can work ? 
To be sure , the rescue plan that was just defeated was far better than what the Bush administration originally proposed . 
But its basic approach remained critically flawed . 
First , it relied - once again - on trickle-down economics : somehow , throwing enough money at Wall Street would trickle down to Main Street , helping ordinary workers and homeowners . 
Trickle-down economics almost never works , and it is no more likely to work this time . 
Moreover , the plan assumed that the fundamental problem was one of confidence . 
That is no doubt part of the problem ; but the underlying problem is that financial markets made some very bad loans . 
There was a housing bubble , and loans were made on the basis of inflated prices . 
That bubble has burst . 
House prices probably will fall further , so there will be more foreclosures , and no amount of talking up the market is going to change that . 
The bad loans , in turn , have created massive holes in banks &quot; balance sheets , which have to be repaired . 
Any government bailout that pays fair value for these assets will do nothing to repair that hole . 
On the contrary , it would be like providing massive blood transfusions to a patient suffering from vast internal hemorrhaging . 
Even if a bailout plan were implemented quickly - which appears increasingly unlikely - there would be some credit contraction . 
The US economy has been sustained by a consumption boom fueled by excessive borrowing , and that will be curtailed . 
States and localities are cutting back expenditures . 
Household balance sheets are weaker . 
An economic slowdown will exacerbate all our financial problems . 
We could do more with less money . 
The holes in financial institutions &quot; balance sheets should be filled in a transparent way . 
The Scandinavian countries showed the way two decades ago . 
Warren Buffet showed another way , in providing equity to Goldman Sachs . 
By issuing preferred shares with warrants ( options ) , one reduces the public &apos;s downside risk and ensures that they participate in some of the upside potential . 
This approach is not only proven , but it also provides both the incentives and wherewithal needed for lending to resume . 
It avoids the hopeless task of trying to value millions of complex mortgages and the even more complex financial products in which they are embedded , and it deals with the &quot; lemons &quot; problem - the government gets stuck with the worst or most overpriced assets . 
Finally , it can be done far more quickly . 
At the same time , several steps can be taken to reduce foreclosures . 
First , housing can be made more affordable for poor and middle-income Americans by converting the mortgage deduction into a cashable tax credit . 
The government effectively pays 50 % of the mortgage interest and real estate taxes for upper-income Americans , yet does nothing for the poor . 
Second , bankruptcy reform is needed to allow homeowners to write down the value of their homes and stay in their houses . 
Third , government could assume part of a mortgage , taking advantage of its lower borrowing costs . 
By contrast , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson &apos;s approach is another example of the kind of shell games that got America into its mess . 
Investment banks and credit rating agencies believed in financial alchemy - the notion that significant value could be created by slicing and dicing securities . 
The new view is that real value can be created by un-slicing and un-dicing - pulling these assets out of the financial system and turning them over to the government . 
But turning them over to the government at market value doesn &apos;t improve banks &quot; balance sheet ; to do that requires overpaying for the assets , a transfer of wealth from ordinary taxpayers to the banks .. 
In the end , there is a high likelihood that if such a plan is ultimately adopted , American taxpayers will be left on the hook . 
In environmental economics , there is a basic principle , called &quot; the polluter pays principle . &quot; 
It is a matter of both equity and efficiency . 
Wall Street has polluted the economy with toxic mortgages . 
It should pay for the cleanup . 
There is a growing consensus among economists that any $ 750 billion bailout based on Paulson &apos;s plan won &apos;t by itself do the trick of resuscitating our economy . 
If so , the huge increase in the national debt and the realization that even $ 700 billion is not enough to rescue the US economy will erode confidence further and aggravate its weakness . 
But it is impossible for politicians to do nothing in such a crisis . 
So we may have to pray that a agreement crafted with the toxic mix of special interests , misguided economics , and right-wing ideologies that produced the crisis can somehow produce a rescue plan that works - or whose failure doesn &apos;t do too much damage . 
Getting things right - including a new regulatory system that reduces the likelihood that such a crisis will recur - is one of the many tasks to be left to the next administration .
