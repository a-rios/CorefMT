The Lessons of Perestroika , 20 Years After 
Twenty years after Mikhail Gorbachev launched perestroika , many people have come to lament the slow pace of reform in Russia under President Vladimir Putin . 
But could it have been otherwise ? 
This should not be a surprise , because the tumultuous Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras left the country exhausted . 
So who can blame Russians for suffering from the reform fatigue ? 
But if Russia is to get back on its feet , more reforms are needed . 
Yet before a new round of reforms is to begin , some basic principles about Russia &apos;s political capacities must be understood . 
The first question that any would-be Russian reformer should ask nowadays ( and which we did not ask during Gorbachev &apos;s perestroika ) is the following , is society prepared to endure the short-term pains of reforms , and how willing it is to endure the pain ? 
The experience of perestroika underscores the importance of this question . 
Perestroika took place at a unique moment in Russian history . 
The great reforms of the past , including the liberation of the serfs in 1861 , followed many years of discussions among westerners , slavophiles , and others . 
The revolutions of 1905 and 1917 also came at a time when those discussions were finished , and everyone knew who stood for what . 
Indeed , I once read that Stalin &apos;s appointment to his first key party post was a mistake . 
But it is still obvious that the entire party knew who Stalin was . 
When they entrusted him with responsibility for convening the constituent assembly , the Bolsheviks knew what they wanted to do with the constituent assembly , because they knew Stalin as a person who would not stop at anything . 
Perestroika was different , because debate had not ended ; indeed , countless debates were raging about what Gorbachev should do . 
Moreover , all previous eras of Russian reform eras and revolutions were connected with some historical model . 
Perestroika had no such historic precedent . 
The transformation from state socialism into a postindustrial society had never occurred anywhere else . 
Thus , perestroika took place in a void . 
Alas , this experience is being repeated . 
Various political leaders of different political parties flash across Russia &apos;s television screens , but there is no real national discussion about how to lead the country forward . 
We are not moving toward a choice reached after countless discussions . 
The second lesson of perestroika concerns the program of reform . 
After two decades of earthshaking change , Russia has still not had a real program of constructive reform . 
To use a modern expression , we don &apos;t have a road map . 
Practically everyone knows what is unacceptable , and what needs to be eliminated . 
But we simply don &apos;t know what should replace things that are eliminated . 
Of course , the exit from socialism was unprecedented . 
Much of what socialism built needed to be undone . 
But it was done using slogans , not a program of change that ordinary Russians could understand and embrace . 
All we have are endless arguments , not practical alternatives to discuss and decide upon . 
One reason that Russia &apos;s reform debates are so barren is the country &apos;s lack of coherent political parties . 
During perestroika and the Yeltsin presidency , the legacy was a widespread hatred and fear of the Communist Party with all its force and power . 
This fear extended to all political parties and all in all blocked the desire to create powerful parties . 
But this suspicion of political parties as such meant that there was no organized body across the country committed to carrying out a consistent , well-thought-out reform program . 
Instead the reforms were decreed from high above , without having any grassroots support - and thus with no lasting durability . 
All we had were direct appeals to the street and the masses rather than encouragement of a genuine social consensus . 
Such a direct method is the wellspring of authoritarianism . 
We must recognize that and understand that it emerges not only when the public is apathetic or frightened , but also when there is no apparent stable advanced guard , such as powerful political parties , which choose the leaders and control them . 
As a result Russia now confronts a situation in which the election of the president is the only political issue . 
In reality , what Russia need are powerful independent social and political organizations that would say : in any presidential term the following things should be done to steer policy , thus making the question of who is president secondary . 
In this respect , Putin &apos;s recent effort to assert tighter state control over private organizations is particularly worrisome . 
But the final and most vital lesson of perestroika concerns the pace of reforms and society &apos;s expectations . 
Simply put , the government must meet the people halfway . 
Yet it also cannot reduce reform to a nullity in order to ingratiate itself with the masses . 
This is a tricky road to pursue , but it is the only one worth taking . 
Indeed , perestroika and the decade of reform that followed demonstrated that just following the formal structures of the Western democratic model isn &apos;t enough if Russia is to see reform implemented consistently . 
For this model , as we have seen in Russia , leads to populist democracy and timid reform . 
The country needs a deeper commitment to reform that will come only when its institutions engage the Russian public in the sort of open debate that we have lacked . 
We must jettison populist democracy and embrace what democracy has always stood for - the engagement of all citizens in running their government .
