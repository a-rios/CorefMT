An Old Problem on China &apos;s New Frontier 
WARSAW - Had the August 1991 putsch against Mikhail Gorbachev not failed , the riots and death recently seen in Xinjiang could have been taking place in Russia . 
Instead of hearing about a crackdown in Urumqi , Xinjiang &apos;s capital , we might be reading about hundreds killed on the streets of Almaty , and columnists would be making comparisons to the bloody crushing of Ukrainian independence demonstrations in Lvov the previous year . 
As with China today , there would have been some feeble international condemnation , and some speculation about possible links between Kazakh militants and exile groups , or Islamic fundamentalists . 
Experts would remind us that Kazakhstan had never been a country , and that Ukrainian claims to independence are historically dubious . 
Substitute Xinjiang for Kazakhstan and Tibet for Ukraine and you get the picture . 
But that putsch , thankfully , ended as a farce . 
The decaying Soviet regime was unable to crush Russia &apos;s growing democratic movement - it would take Vladimir Putin to do that a decade later . 
By opting for the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 , the Chinese Communist leadership set their country on a road starkly different from the one on which Russia subsequently embarked . 
Though China &apos;s policies have brought about Pinochet-style economic growth , if on the scale of a country that is almost a continent unto itself , they have also ensured that there is in no freedom for anyone , including the Han majority . 
This , in turn , means that , while Kazakhstan and Ukraine are independent , Tibet and Xinjiang alternate between phases of violent agitation and bloody repression . 
Though Russia today is autocratically governed , the introduction of a Chinese-style dictatorship seems hardly plausible , while GDP per capita was $ 15,800 last year , or almost three times that of China . 
Yet a majority of the Chinese population seems to support its &quot; government &apos;s policies , including its brutal suppression of minorities and denial of democratic freedoms . 
In fact , the latter seems to be the price paid for the success of the former . 
This is not a novel phenomenon . 
In 1863 , the Russian democratic émigré thinker Alexander Herzen , commenting on the brutal crushing of the Polish uprising by the Tsarist army , wrote in his publication 
When Herzen was writing his words , Moscow was not only busy successfully putting down the Poles , reasserting its rule there for another half-century , but also , together with China , carving up Central Asia , known then as Turkestan . 
The eastern part of the region fell under Chinese rule , and was renamed Xinjiang , or New Frontier . 
Each time Chinese rule weakened , as in the 1930 &quot; s and 1940 &quot; s , short-lived East Turkestan Republics were established , with Russian support , only to flounder when Russia and China struck new deals . 
The leadership of the second East Turkestan Republic was presumably murdered on Stalin &apos;s orders , when the plane carrying it to Beijing for talks allegedly crashed in Soviet airspace . 
Since then , East Turkestan has existed solely on paper , as a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization ( UNPO ) , a would-be competitor of the United Nations set up in 1991 . 
In Xinjiang itself , the current agitation is more social than nationalist in character , and targets cultural oppression ( Han Chinese by now make up half of the region &apos;s population ) rather than expressing aspirations for independence . 
Yet the recent bloodbath there is almost sure to change that , as violence unavoidably breeds radicalization . 
In the short and medium term , China &apos;s rule in Xinjiang and Tibet seems secure : the international community will not challenge a Security Council member state . 
Only its own citizens could do that , but Herzen &apos;s package deal seems to prevent that : just like the Tibetans , the Uighurs elicit not Han solidarity , but a braying for their blood - somewhat understandable , given that ordinary Han in Lhasa and Urumqi were made to pay with their own for China &apos;s misdeeds . 
In the longer term , however , the Chinese authorities have every reason to be worried : Xinjiang will grow to be a problem like Tibet . 
Indeed , though the UNPO , to which both belong - alongside Assyria and the Buffalo River Dene Nation - has a vaguely Marx Brothers &quot; air to it ( one expects Freedonia , the mythical country of which Groucho Marx was prime minister , to be on the roster ) , six member states already have left it to join the UN , and Kosovo , now independent if lacking UN recognition , will eventually follow . 
Political maps are never carved in stone . 
It is therefore safe to assume that not only obscure academics and correspondents , but officials in Beijing as well , are now busy studying the history of the Ghulja uprising and of Osman Batur &apos;s guerillas . 
Come to think of it : whatever happened to the Poles , whom Russia so successfully put down in 1863 ?
