Bush Inherits the Wind 
The most shocking statement in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was President George W. Bush &apos;s remark that &quot; I don &apos;t think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees &quot; that protect New Orleans from flooding . 
New Orleans is a city mostly below sea level , and must be protected by levees to keep water out . 
Concern that the levees might break in the midst of a powerful hurricane was widespread among scientists , engineers , and emergency-preparedness experts . 
Yet Bush apparently did not know of these concerns , even days after the hurricane destroyed the levees and flooded the city . 
There is a simple fact on display here , one that goes well beyond this particular hurricane , and even this particular president . 
Bush bears much responsibility for this . 
He has proven to be one of America &apos;s least knowledgeable presidents when it comes to science - and one of the most ready to turn science into a political issue . 
In recent months , Bush undermined biological theories of evolution in favor of Christian fundamentalist dogmas . 
He disdains climate science and public health science when it conflicts with the beliefs - and interests - of his core supporters . 
Simply put , Bush &apos;s record on science policy is miserable . 
Climate scientists have warned for years that global warming caused by manmade emissions of greenhouse gases will generate more extreme storms . 
While there is no scientific way to link a particular hurricane such as Katrina to the long-term trend - in the sense that Katrina might have been bad luck rather than a sign of manmade climate change - the energy of hurricanes throughout the world has been rising markedly . 
Bush , alas , led an aggressive effort to discredit climate science rather than to respond to its findings . 
He called for delays in reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming , which in turn causes the energy of hurricanes to rise . 
According to the underlying science that Bush ignores , hurricanes take their energy from the warmth of seawater . 
That is why hurricanes occur in hot tropical regions , and at the end of the summer months , when the sea surface temperatures are at their annual maximum . 
Manmade global warming raises not only air temperatures , but sea-surface temperatures as well . 
Higher sea-surface temperatures translate into more powerful storms in the world &apos;s oceans . 
Hurricanes are measured according to three dimensions : frequency , intensity , and duration . 
The frequency of hurricanes has not changed much , if at all . 
Intensity measures a hurricane &apos;s force , which includes wind speeds , and there has been some recorded increase . 
The biggest change , however , has been in the duration of hurricanes : how many days each hurricane lasts . 
Duration has risen markedly around the world . 
The total energy of a hurricane is found by multiplying the intensity of the hurricane by its duration . 
This , too , has risen sharply , and more is in store as temperatures rise . 
Scientists and engineers who work on climate change stress that governments need to adopt two main responses . 
The first , called &quot; mitigation , &quot; means reducing the amount of manmade climate change . 
This can be done by changing the world &apos;s energy system to limit emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere - the main driver of manmade climate change . 
One option is a shift to non-carbon energy sources , such as renewable energy ( solar and wind power ) and nuclear energy . 
Another option is to combine carbon-based energy ( coal , oil , and gas ) with new technologies that prevent the emission of airborne carbon . 
The second response to climate change , called &quot; adaptation , &quot; requires that we ready ourselves for the climate change now underway and the increased climate change to come in future years . 
This means preparing for hurricanes that are more powerful in both intensity and duration . 
An attentive national government would surely have realized that the Gulf region of the United States is more vulnerable to high-energy hurricanes . 
Indeed , Hurricane Katrina was the third most intense hurricane ever to make landfall in the US . 
Such a government would have taken more action to strengthen levees . 
The Bush administration &apos;s negligence is especially shocking given the remarkable amount of scientific expertise that exists in the US . 
But the US government &apos;s failings are matched in many parts of the world , and certainly in the poorest countries , where scientific expertise is scarce , and where many governments do not have scientific advisory councils to turn to for guidance . 
Hurricane Katrina is a wakeup call , not only for the US but for the world . 
We are entering a period when good science is vital for our survival . 
On a crowded planet with threats to our climate , oceans , forests , food production , and water supply , and with global travel and high population densities increasing the risk of worldwide disease epidemics , we must turn to the best of our scientific and engineering knowledge to find a safe passage .
