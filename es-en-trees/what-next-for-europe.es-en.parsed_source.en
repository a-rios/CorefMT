What Next for Europe ? 
In many ways , 2005 has been Europe &apos;s annus horibilis . 
It began well , when Spanish voters approved the draft European Union constitution , but it turned sour when French and Dutch voters spurned it soon after . 
Those votes partly reflected displeasure with domestic policies , and partly disappointment with the way governments conduct European affairs . 
Governments promptly obliged with more of the same . 
Within days of the votes , they failed to agree on the EU budget for 2007-13 . 
French and British leaders engaged in a heated quarrel that derailed the subsequent summit , before Britain assumed the rotating six-month EU presidency in July . 
Normally , countries use their EU presidencies to display their ability to solve problems and move the Union forward . 
But , as of early December , Britain has remained dormant . 
Besides burying the draft constitution , it has largely sidestepped the budget issue . 
Chances that it gets the budget approved this year are slim , and , unless the dispute is resolved soon , the Union will not have an operational budget by 2007 . 
Even if a budget is adopted , there is no lack of depressing business for the Austrian presidency , which starts on January 1 . 
The deepest problem is Europe &apos;s inability to grow at more than a snail &apos;s pace and to provide jobs to its citizens . 
This is mostly due to the Big Three - France , Germany , and Italy - which produce 70 % of Europe &apos;s GDP . 
The collective response , adopted in 2000 , has been the &quot; Lisbon Strategy , &quot; which aims at making the EU &quot; the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world &quot; by 2010 . 
More realistically , it is designed to provide governments with the incentive to undertake the reforms that stimulate economic growth and productivity . 
That means facing down the myriad interest groups - from industry lobbies to trade unions and entrenched bureaucracies - that have ( so far ) successfully protected their turfs . 
The strategy rests on peer pressure , naming and shaming governments that fail to make progress . 
In practice , however , peer pressure has become peer collusion . 
When EU leaders met last spring to assess progress , they pitifully recognized that the Lisbon Strategy &apos;s goal was unlikely to be met . 
The best that they could do now would be to dump the pretense of a strategy and carry on with the other business . 
Unfortunately , the host of the 2000 summit was Jos√© Manuel Barroso , then Prime Minister of Portugal and current President of the European Commission , who has staked his presidency on the Lisbon Strategy . 
Expect him to push on hopelessly . 
One of the few good ideas contained in the Lisbon Strategy was to remove barriers to trade in services . 
Intra-European competition in services is restricted by innumerable national regulations that , for instance , strictly determine the requirements for becoming a hairdresser or a plumber . 
One of the defining features of the past decades is the sharp increase in services productivity in the US ; none of that happened in Europe . 
Guess why . 
Because services account for 70 % of European GDP , the potential impact from enhanced competition is substantial . 
But removing protection is always politically difficult . 
The European Commission submitted a proposal in 2005 - just as the constitution was being put up for a vote . 
Not surprisingly , the proposal was quickly shelved . 
Now , with countless private interest groups trying to water it down into irrelevance , the battle will be firmly on the EU &apos;s agenda in 2006 . 
At the same time , Europe is again blocking progress in the Doha round of world trade talks , with the farmers &quot; lobby fighting to preserve its subsidies . 
Many governments are so fearful of their farmers that they see no other option than to hold their ground , no matter what . 
Europe has agreed to a single trade policy . 
When disagreements run as deep as they do on agriculture , there can be no give-and-take of the kind that allows for successful negotiations . 
There is little reason for optimism . 
And what next for the ECB , which has just nudged up interest rates by 0.25 % , after 30 months on hold . 
Experts can disagree about whether the move was premature , but no one agrees with the many political leaders who have argued that the tiny hike will derail the timid resumption of economic growth . 
The sharpness of political attacks on the ECB might trigger dangerous talk about restricting its independence . 
While such a move is out of the question - it would require a change in the European Treaty - the noise is unhealthy . 
It distracts the ECB , adds to the impression that Europe is bad , and , more importantly , will be used by ineffective governments as a scapegoat for their failings . 
Expect more ECB-bashing . 
Is Europe stuck ? 
The current team of leaders has been an enormous disappointment . 
But as they fade away , there could be some light at the end of the tunnel . 
In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel is obviously more positive on Europe and more pro-reform than her predecessor , but she is tied up in a grand coalition . 
In France , President Jacques Chirac , the epitome of a leader captured by his lobbies , is staggering impotently toward the end of his term in 2007 . 
The two frontrunners to succeed him , Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy , both in government , compete on a reformist agenda , but pre-election years do not encourage bold moves . 
Meanwhile , Italy must decide whether it replaces Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who displayed no interest in reform and European affairs , with the cautious Romano Prodi , the former European Commission President . 
Tony Blair , once an ardent pro-European ( at least by Britain &apos;s undemanding standards ) , might finally have to cede power to Gordon Brown , who is famously cold to European integration . 
Fortunately , Britain has always been an outsider . 
In the end , whatever light there is , it may not shine until 2007 , after the French elections .
