Taking Back Immigration 
LONDON - Within hours of US President Barack Obama &apos;s re-election last month , a powerful belief took hold : overwhelming support from Latino voters had helped to secure his victory . 
Suddenly , the Republican Party , long identified with a hard line on immigration , started talking about the need for comprehensive reform . 
Pundits argued that if the Republicans resisted reform , they would lose the Latino vote for the next generation , relegating their party to near-permanent opposition status . 
That might or might not be true . 
But the American election &apos;s implications for immigration run deeper than electoral expediency - with lessons for governments around the world . 
The remarkable speed with which anti-immigration positions buckled indicates that what most Americans want , above all , is a rational approach ; they want their political leaders to take responsibility for the issue , rather than running away from it . 
When it comes to immigration , politicians usually are driven by fear - a tendency that has become even more acute since the onset of the global financial crisis . 
The rise of extreme nationalists in places like Greece and Finland has reinforced the belief that talking about immigration , except to argue against it , is politically fraught . 
So politicians either address immigration in the context of border security and cultural identity , or they ignore it . 
But they might well be misreading their citizens &quot; concerns . 
Voter reaction is often less about disliking immigrants than it is about a profound sense of frustration that governments have failed to create an immigration system that works . 
They want a system that allows for the legal entry of needed workers , while preventing illegal entry ; clamps down on exploitative employers ; and provides resources to integrate immigrants into communities . 
Voters might not like that some migrants enter their country illegally . 
When migration is undertaken in a legal , orderly way , the public supports it . 
A recent transatlantic survey by the German Marshall Fund found that , while majorities in all countries were worried about illegal immigration , anxiety about legal immigration was low - with only 26 % of European respondents expressing concern , and just 18 % doing so in the United States . 
Ceding the immigration debate to extremists has abetted another extraordinary distortion : people generally believe that the number of immigrants in their countries is far higher than it actually is . 
In the same German Marshall Fund survey , British respondents estimated that 31.8 % of the United Kingdom &apos;s population was foreign born ; the true figure is 11.3 % . 
Such false perceptions make it even more difficult to have a reasonable debate about the issues . 
Tackling migration-related challenges is necessary regardless of whether one favors more or less immigration . 
Today , according to the United Nations , there are 214 million people living outside their country of birth , up from approximately 82 million in 1970 . 
So , even if not a single new person were to cross a border , the challenges would still be with us . 
The reality , of course , is that many countries , especially OECD members , will decide that they need more immigrants as their own populations age and shrink . 
This implies that they should figure out how to manage immigration well , rather than outsourcing much of the process to smugglers and extremists . 
And , in a world in which nearly half of migrants are now moving from one developing country to another , the problems are no longer confined to the West . 
The good news is that there have been important advances during the last decade in managing migration . 
For example , policymakers can draw on successful programs to integrate migrant children into educational systems . 
Developing countries , meanwhile , are getting smarter about how to leverage the $ 406 billion in remittances that their expatriate citizens will send home this year - by issuing diaspora bonds , for example , or by creating targeted investment opportunities for them . 
Many pivotal stakeholders also are advocating for a more rational immigration system . 
Labor unions , once known for their skepticism toward immigration , are increasingly in favor of pro-immigration reforms . 
In fact , unions were a driving force behind last year &apos;s Domestic Workers Convention , which seeks to protect the rights of the world &apos;s estimated 50-100 million domestic workers . 
By supporting smart , progressive reforms , politicians should at least be able to neutralize the issue of immigration on Election Day , if not turn it to their advantage . 
More important , electoral politics aside , they would be helping to craft better societies whose politics are shaped by reasonable debate among citizens , not distorted by the community-destroying behavior of smugglers and extremists . 
This , after all , is what democratic politics is all about .
