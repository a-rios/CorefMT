The Debt Delusion 
WASHINGTON , DC  -  
But there is a deeper problem that has been overlooked : the US economy relies upon asset price inflation and rising indebtedness to fuel growth . 
Therein lies a profound contradiction . 
On one hand , policy must fuel asset bubbles to keep the economy growing . 
On the other hand , such bubbles inevitably create financial crises when they eventually implode . 
This is a contradiction with global implications . 
Many countries have relied for growth on US consumer spending and investments in outsourcing to supply those consumers . 
If America &apos;s bubble economy is now tapped out , global growth will slow sharply . 
It is not clear that other countries have the will or capacity to develop alternative engines of growth . 
America &apos;s economic contradictions are part of a new business cycle that has emerged since 1980 . 
The business cycles of Presidents Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and George W. Bush share strong similarities and are different from pre-1980 cycles . 
The similarities are large trade deficits , manufacturing job loss , asset price inflation , rising debt-to-income ratios , and detachment of wages from productivity growth . 
The new cycle rests on financial booms and cheap imports . 
Financial booms provide collateral that supports debt-financed spending . 
Borrowing is also supported by an easing of credit standards and new financial products that increase leverage and widen the range of assets that can be borrowed against . 
Cheap imports ameliorate the effects of wage stagnation . 
This structure contrasts with the pre-1980 business cycle , which rested on wage growth tied to productivity growth and full employment . 
Wage growth , rather than borrowing and financial booms , fuelled demand growth . 
That encouraged investment spending , which in turn drove productivity gains and output growth . 
The differences between the new and old cycle are starkly revealed in attitudes toward the trade deficit . 
Previously , trade deficits were viewed as a serious problem , being a leakage of demand that undermined employment and output . 
Since 1980 , trade deficits have been dismissed as the outcome of free-market choices . 
Moreover , the Federal Reserve has viewed trade deficits as a helpful brake on inflation , while politicians now view them as a way to buy off consumers afflicted by wage stagnation . 
The new business cycle also embeds a monetary policy that replaces concern with real wages with a focus on asset prices . 
Whereas pre-1980 monetary policy tacitly aimed at putting a floor under labor markets to preserve employment and wages , it now tacitly puts a floor under asset prices . 
This is not a matter of the Fed bailing out investors . 
Rather , the economy has become so vulnerable to declines in asset prices that the Fed is obliged to intervene to prevent them from inflicting broad damage . 
All these features have been present in the current economic expansion . 
Wages have stagnated despite strong productivity growth , while the trade deficit has set new records . 
Manufacturing has lost 1.8 million jobs . 
Prior to 1980 , manufacturing employment increased during every expansion and always exceeded the previous peak level . 
Between 1980 and 2000 , manufacturing employment continued to grow in expansions , but each time it failed to recover the previous peak . 
This time , manufacturing employment has actually fallen during the expansion , something unprecedented in American history . 
The essential role of asset inflation has been especially visible as a result of the housing bubble , which also highlights the role of monetary policy . 
Despite the massive tax cuts of 2001 and the increase in military and security spending , the US experienced a prolonged jobless recovery . 
That compelled the Fed to keep interest rates at historic lows for an extended period , and rates were raised only gradually because of fears about the recovery &apos;s fragility . 
Low interest rates eventually jump-started the expansion through a house price bubble that supported a debt-financed consumer-spending binge and triggered a construction boom . 
Meanwhile , prolonged low interest rates contributed to a &quot; chase for yield &quot; in the financial sector that resulted in disregard of credit risk . 
In this way , the Fed contributed to creating the sub-prime crisis . 
However , in the Fed &apos;s defense , low interest rates were needed to maintain the expansion . 
In effect , the new cycle locks the Fed into an unstable stance whereby it must prevent asset price declines to avert recession , yet must also promote asset bubbles to sustain expansions . 
So , even if the Fed and US Treasury now manage to stave off recession , what will fuel future growth ? 
With debt burdens elevated and housing prices significantly above levels warranted by their historical relation to income , the business cycle of the last two decades appears exhausted . 
It is not enough to deal only with the crisis of the day . 
Policy must also chart a stable long-term course , which implies the need to reconsider the paradigm of the past 25 years . 
That means ending trade deficits that drain spending and jobs , and restoring the link between wages and productivity . 
That way , wage income , not debt and asset price inflation , can again provide the engine of demand growth .
