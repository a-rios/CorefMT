Helmut Schmidt &apos;s World 
BERLIN - Germany lost one of its giants this week when former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt died at the great age of 96 . 
Schmidt was the country &apos;s defense minister from 1969 to 1972 , finance minister from 1972 to 1974 , and federal chancellor from 1974 to 1982 . 
Our own day and age may seem particularly tumultuous ; but the years when Schmidt governed Germany were anything but quiet . 
His was the age of Ostpolitik and détente , of the first global oil crisis , of economic recession , stagflation , and the return to Europe of mass unemployment . 
His generation confronted the scourge of domestic terrorism and witnessed revolution in Iran , the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , and the rise of Solidarity in Poland . 
Schmidt is remembered as a hands-on pragmatist , but above all as an accomplished crisis manager . 
He proved his judgment and his leadership abilities early on , when , as a city senator in Hamburg , he confronted the great flood of 1962 , which devastated the city . 
Schmidt reinforced his image as a pragmatist by consistently voicing his deep skepticism of grand designs and long-term visions , albeit without ever renouncing his fundamental belief that there was a moral basis for his political objectives . 
So it should be no surprise that Karl Popper , with his pragmatic yet value-based approach , was his favorite philosopher . 
But there was always more to Schmidt &apos;s outlook on the world : As a son of Germany &apos;s largest port city , he was a committed internationalist , genuinely interested in what lay beyond our borders . 
As a student of Popper , and carrying the memories and scars of the catastrophe of the Nazi years , he was acutely aware throughout his life of both the strengths and the vulnerabilities of our open societies . 
Schmidt understood that a practical politician had to deal with events as they unfolded , managing them as astutely as possible . 
But he understood instinctively that daily events were shaped by powerful trends and forces : the strategic competition between East and West , the evolving international financial system in the age of global interdependence , and the consequences of decolonization . 
He was one of the first in Germany to notice the rise of China and reckon with the implications of Asia &apos;s return to a leading role on the world stage . 
For Schmidt , thorough analysis was a necessary prerequisite for all political action . 
He particularly abhorred an emotional approach to foreign policy . 
He didn &apos;t suffer fools gladly . 
Together with French President Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , he pushed for the establishment of the Group of Seven to coordinate international economic policies , and played a leadership role at the G-7 &quot; s first summit , in Rambouillet in 1975 . 
That same year he sat next to East Germany &apos;s leader Erich Honecker in Helsinki while signing the &quot; Final Act &quot; of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe - a major breakthrough for détente policy and in opening the closed societies of the USSR and Warsaw Pact . 
Schmidt &apos;s relationship with US President Jimmy Carter was difficult , as many people have chronicled . 
Yet Schmidt was always a strong advocate of a close transatlantic partnership , which he saw as indispensable for Germany &apos;s security and foreign policy . 
In fact , his initiative to counter the Soviet deployment of SS-20 intermediate-range nuclear missiles , a plan he set out in a major speech in 1977 , was motivated above all by concerns about a potential decoupling of Europe and its US ally . 
Schmidt &apos;s principled commitment to the so-called NATO Double-Track Decision in 1979 , whereby intermediate-range nuclear missiles were eventually to be eliminated from Europe , came to the chagrin of many in his own party . 
But it was informed by his careful and sober reading of the evolving strategic landscape . 
Finally , Schmidt was a true European . 
He had lived through the cataclysm that extreme nationalism had wrought in Germany . 
He remained skeptical about notions of irreversible progress . 
Change for the better could emerge only from practical initiatives , not from Sunday speeches . 
Thus , European integration had to be created by real policies and institutions , not by decree . 
So he and Giscard created the European Council ( composed of the heads of Europe &apos;s governments ) , which is now a major player in the European Union &apos;s institutional set-up . 
They pushed forward the idea of monetary integration , which came to fruition a generation later . 
They embodied the Franco-German commitment to a unified , peaceful Europe , able to pull its weight globally only if and when it acts in unity and with a sense of purpose . 
Schmidt remained a mentor to the German people for decades after leaving active politics . 
International crises , global order , and the future of Europe remained his fundamental preoccupations , and he saw a role and a responsibility for his own country in addressing and shaping all three of them . 
His thinking had a strong normative foundation , but his keen understanding of the world led him to approach foreign policy with a sense of humility and strategic patience . 
It is this rare combination of morality and perseverance that is his legacy as a foreign policy thinker and practitioner . 
We would do well to keep his priorities and his principles uppermost in our minds , now that he is no longer here to remind us of their necessity .
