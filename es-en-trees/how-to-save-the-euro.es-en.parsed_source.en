How to Save the Euro 
BRUSSELS - The European Union is facing a constitutional moment . 
The founders of Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) warned even before the euro &apos;s birth that fiscal profligacy would constitute a danger to the common currency &apos;s stability . 
Nevertheless , the euro-zone &apos;s member countries insisted on maintaining their full sovereignty in this area . 
The solution to this conundrum was supposed to have been the Stability and Growth Pact , working in tandem with the so-called &quot; no bailout &quot; clause in the Maastricht Treaty . 
The latter was intended to impose market discipline , and the former , to preserve the stability of public finances by fixing a strict limit on the size of national budget deficits . 
Both proved futile . 
The Stability and Growth Pact clearly did not prevent &quot; excessive &quot; deficits , and the no-bailout clause failed its first test when European leaders , facing the Greek crisis , solemnly declared on February 11 that euro-zone members would &quot; take determined and coordinated action , if needed , to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . &quot; 
The failure to impose market discipline via the no-bailout clause was predictable : in a systemic crisis , the immediate concern to preserve the stability of markets almost always trumps the desire to prevent the moral hazard that arises when imprudent debtors are saved . But in September 2008 , the United States government thought otherwise , and allowed Lehman Brothers to fail in order to impose market discipline . 
The disaster that followed illustrated the damage that an uncontrolled failure can produce . 
Yet the lesson should not be that failure has to be avoided at all costs : applied to the case of Greece , this would mean that the pressure on the Greek government to adjust would evaporate . 
The alternative , instead , is to think ahead and prepare for failure ! 
A debtor &apos;s strongest negotiating asset is always that creditors cannot contemplate default , because default would bring down the entire financial system . 
But market discipline can be established only if default is a true possibility . 
This is why it is crucial to create a mechanism to contain the cost - and thus minimize the unavoidable disruptions - resulting from a default . 
This is the key aim of the Euro ( pean ) Monetary Fund ( EMF ) , which Thomas Mayer and I have proposed , and which has been put on the Union table for discussion by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble , among others . 
The EMF ( or rather ESF , as some have dubbed it , for European Stability Fund ) could manage an orderly default of an EMU member country that fails to comply with the conditions attached to an adjustment program . 
We imagine a simple mechanism , modeled on the successful experience with Brady bonds . 
These were bonds issued by distressed Latin American countries in the early 1990 &quot; s as part of an arrangement to reschedule their international debts . US government securities provided collateral for them . 
To safeguard against the systemic effects of a default , the EMF could offer holders of the defaulting country &apos;s debt an exchange of this debt against claims on the EMF . 
Of course , debt-holders would be obliged to accept a uniform discount ( or &quot; haircut &quot; ) on what they are owed . 
This would be a key measure to limit the disruption from a default . 
A default creates ripple effects throughout the financial system , because all debt instruments of a defaulting country become , at least upon impact , worthless and illiquid . 
But , with an exchange Ã  la Brady bonds , the losses to financial institutions would be limited ( and could be controlled by the choice of the haircut given to creditors ) . 
In return for offering the exchange against a haircut , the EMF would acquire the claims against the defaulting country , which would then receive any additional funds from the EMF only for specific purposes that the EMF approves . 
Other EU transfer payments would also be disbursed by the EMF under strict scrutiny , or they could be used to pay down the defaulting country &apos;s debt to the EMF . 
Thus , the EMF would provide a framework for sovereign bankruptcy comparable to the procedures that exist in the US for bankrupt companies that qualify for restructuring . 
How would the EMF finance its interventions ? 
We propose to establish a common insurance fund with contributions proportional to the risk that each member country represents . 
Ideally , one should base the contributions on market indicators of default risk . 
But the very existence of the EMF would distort credit-default swap spreads and yield differentials among EMF members . 
We therefore propose that contributions to the EMF should be based on member countries &quot; fiscal deficits and public debt levels , because both represent warning signs of impending liquidity or insolvency risk . 
The EMF could receive a levy that would be proportional to any fiscal deficit in excess of 3 % of GDP and public debt in excess of 60 % of GDP - the caps imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact . 
This levy would represent a sort of automatic fine , thus making the elaborate structure of the Pact redundant . 
These two simple elements - orderly default and a financing mechanism - could resolve the current crisis within the euro zone : by creating a European Monetary Fund along these lines , the euro area would acquire an institution that could support member countries in difficulties , but that would also ensure that market discipline really worked .
