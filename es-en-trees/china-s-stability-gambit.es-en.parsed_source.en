China &apos;s Stability Gambit 
BEIJING - The first principle that I learned when I started focusing on China in the late 1990 &quot; s is that nothing is more important to the Chinese than stability - whether economic , social , or political . 
Given centuries of turmoil in China , today &apos;s leaders will do everything in their power to preserve stability . 
Whenever I have doubts about a potential Chinese policy shift , I examine the options through the stability lens . 
It has worked like a charm . 
Stability was on everyone &apos;s mind at the annual China Development Forum ( CDF ) held March 17-20 in Beijing . 
Hosted by Premier Wen Jiabao , with many ministers of the State Council in attendance , the CDF is China &apos;s most important international conference . 
Yet , literally two days before this year &apos;s CDF began , the controversial Bo Xilai was removed as Party Secretary of Chongqing . 
As a strong candidate to join the Standing Committee of the Politburo , China &apos;s inner circle of leadership , Bo &apos;s sudden demise was stunning . 
There was a palpable buzz in the air as we convened in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse . 
The formal sessions played out predictably , placing great emphasis on the coming structural transformation of China &apos;s growth model - a colossal shift from the all-powerful export- and investment-led growth of the past 32 years to a more consumer-led dynamic . 
There is now broad consensus among China &apos;s senior leadership in favor of such a rebalancing . 
As one participant put it , &quot; The debate has shifted from what to do to how and when to do it . &quot; 
Many of the other themes flowed from this general conclusion . 
A shift to services-led growth and an innovations-based development strategy were highlighted . 
At the same time , there was considerable concern about the recent resurgence of state-owned enterprises , which has tilted the distribution of national income from labor to capital - a major impediment to China &apos;s pro-consumption rebalancing . 
The World Bank and the China Development Research Center ( the CDF &apos;s host ) had just released a comprehensive report that addressed many aspects of this critical issue . 
But the CDF &apos;s formal proceedings never even hinted at the elephant in the chambers of Diaoyutai . 
There was no mention of Bo Xilai and what his dismissal meant for China &apos;s domestic politics in this critical year of leadership transition . 
While it is easy to get caught up in the swirling tales of palace intrigue that have followed , I suspect that Bo &apos;s removal holds a far deeper meaning . 
Chinese officials faced the risk of a dangerous interplay of political and economic instability . 
Hit by a second external demand shock in three years - first , America &apos;s subprime crisis , and now Europe &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis - any outbreak of internal political instability would pose a far greater threat than might otherwise be the case . 
Bo personified that risk . 
He embodied the so-called &quot; Chongqing model &quot; of state capitalism that has been ascendant in China in recent years - government-directed urbanization and economic development that concentrates power in the hands of regional leaders and state-owned enterprises . 
I spent some time in Chongqing - a vast metropolitan area of more than 34 million people - last summer . 
I left astonished at the scope of the city &apos;s plans . 
Orchestrated by Chongqing Mayor Huang Qifan , the principal architect of the spectacular Pudong development project in Shanghai , the goal is to transform the Liangjiang area of Chongqing into China &apos;s first inland urban development zone . 
That would put Liangjiang on a par with coastal China &apos;s two earlier showcase projects - Pudong and the Binhai area of Tianjin . 
Yet this is the same state-dominated development model that came under heavy criticism at this year &apos;s CDF - and that stands in sharp contrast to the more market-driven alternative that has gained broad consensus among senior Chinese leaders . 
In other words , Bo was perceived not only as a threat to political stability , but also as the leading representative of a model of economic instability . 
By dismissing Bo so abruptly , the central government has , in effect , underscored its unwavering commitment to stability . 
This fits with yet another curious piece of the Chinese puzzle . 
Five years ago , Wen famously warned of a Chinese economy that was in danger of becoming &quot; unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and unsustainable . &quot; 
I have repeatedly stressed the critical role that Wen &apos;s &quot; Four Uns &quot; have played in shaping the pro-consumption strategy of the &quot; Next China . &quot; 
Wen &apos;s critique paved the way for China to face its rebalancing imperatives head on . 
But , in their formal remarks to the CDF this year , China &apos;s senior leadership - including Premier-designate Li Keqiang - dropped all explicit references to the risks of an &quot; unstable &quot; Chinese economy . 
In short , the Four Uns have now become three . 
In China , such changes in language are no accident . 
The most likely interpretation is that those at the top no longer want to concede anything when it comes to stability . 
By addressing economic instability through pro-consumption rebalancing , and political instability by removing Bo , stability has gone from a risk factor to an ironclad commitment . 
There can be no mistaking the Chinese leadership &apos;s core message nowadays . 
They are the first to concede that their growth and development strategy is at a critical juncture . 
They worry that the &quot; reforms and opening up &quot; of Deng Xiaoping are in danger of losing momentum . 
By addressing the interplay between economic and political risks to stability , the government is clearing the way for the next phase of China &apos;s extraordinary development . 
I would not advise betting against their commitment to achieving that goal .
