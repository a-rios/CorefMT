Reinvigorating Egypt &apos;s Economy 
NEWPORT BEACH - Some two years into Egypt &apos;s grass-roots revolution , the country &apos;s economy is in a worrisome downward spiral . 
A growing number of people , inside and outside of the country , are starting to blame the revolution itself for derailing an economy that was growing , reducing its external-debt burden , and maintaining a comfortable cushion of international reserves . 
Blaming the revolution is the wrong approach to Egypt &apos;s current economic woes . 
Yet its appeal to some is understandable , given that the country &apos;s economic situation has continued to worsen over the last few months . 
Growth is anemic , unemployment is high , and new investment has fallen off dramatically - all of which complicate already-difficult financial , social , and political conditions . 
The result is a growing threat of several vicious circles at once . 
Domestic supply disruptions are now fueling inflation and compounding the problems of a subsidy-laden national budget . 
They have also aggravated the weakness of external finances , contributing to a sharp drop in international reserves that has been contained only by exceptional loans and deposits from abroad . 
Inadequate growth and higher inflation impose a particularly severe burden on Egypt &apos;s most vulnerable . 
Public safety nets are overstretched , with too many poor people falling through . 
Moreover , other support networks - including income opportunities in tourism , the informal sector , and charitable and family support - are crumbling under the pressure of growing poverty . 
This broad set of spiraling difficulties has led credit-rating agencies to slash Egypt &apos;s rating . 
It is also discouraging foreign direct investment , as is the discrediting of Egypt &apos;s police forces . 
As a result , still more sources of working and investment capital are disrupted , amplifying the impact of domestic capital flight . 
None of this facilitates the political reconciliation and national unity that Egypt needs to complete the most difficult of all revolutionary pivots : from dismantling an oppressive past to building a better future . 
Indeed , having suffered from post-revolutionary institutional and political dysfunctions , economic decline is now itself fueling these destabilizers . 
To be fair , governments - first under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and now under the Muslim Brotherhood - have recognized the challenges . 
Their responses , however , have fallen short , following a familiar sequence that begins with waiting for an endogenous bounce and aspiring to self-reliance . 
When no miracle arrives , they opt for capital controls and consider asset sales and leases while courting those once viewed as having perpetuated the old order . 
The post-revolutionary government &apos;s initial narrative characterized Egypt &apos;s economic malaise as temporary and self-correcting . 
Having overthrown Hosni Mubarak &apos;s iron-fisted 30-year-old regime in a remarkably quick and relatively peaceful manner , Egypt &apos;s revolutionary masses were to leave the streets and pursue an all-out drive for economic prosperity and social justice . 
Their efforts would be supported by the re-orientation of public institutions ( and governance more broadly ) away from benefiting the privileged few toward an ethos of service to all of the country &apos;s citizens . 
This narrative reflected ( understandable ) revolutionary exuberance rather than realities on the ground . 
It takes years to reform institutions . 
Economic and financial transmission lines cannot be rerouted quickly . 
Discredited businesses cannot be replaced overnight . 
Credible political parties are not easy to organize on the fly . 
And many of those who bravely fought for freedom had little political experience , placing an even greater premium on great leadership to channel Egyptians &quot; enormous energy - and their demands for greater social justice - into a shared vision and common purpose . 
The resulting power vacuums were filled by those whose prior positions in society gave them an inside track at the time of the popular uprising . 
They assumed power with a set of ideas and operating procedures that had to catch up with the new Egypt . 
As the economy struggled , optimism gave way to a more defensive and insular view that values self-reliance . 
Accompanied by creeping economic controls , the narrative became more nationalistic . 
Loyalty , rather than merit , drove key appointments , making policy management even more difficult . 
With this approach offering no better chance at success , the country has been pushed back to pursuing measures that , at least in the mind of much of the public , are associated with the old regime . 
Securing a loan from the International Monetary Fund has become the principal objective of economic management , coupled with other anxious attempts to raise financing . 
What Egypt needs today cannot be provided only by IMF loans and asset leases . 
That is the bad news . 
The good news is that , as someone who has followed similar cases for more than 30 years , I can say with confidence that Egypt has all the components needed to restore economic and financial stability : resources , people , dynamism , entrepreneurship , location , and regional and global linkages . 
Egypt also has a powerful secret weapon that is yet to be fully deployed - a generation of young people who , after years of alienation and repression , believe that they can ( and should ) influence the country &apos;s destiny . 
Already , some are making a notable difference on the ground , attracting widespread admiration . 
Egypt is not a country where economic sectors and segments of the population can succeed despite the government . 
The government must provide the context to restart the engines of economic recovery ; and policies should serve as growth accelerators by providing development gateways for the energetic young , the restive poor , and the pressured middle class . 
This brings us back to the interactions between economics , politics , and finance , which are now fueling a tailspin that is harming Egypt &apos;s citizens and threatening their children &apos;s future . 
Appropriate political reforms must come first ; when they do , Egypt &apos;s economic and financial revival will surprise many with its buoyancy and speed . 
Think of a car that can and should achieve great performance based on its strong internal engine . 
Egypt is capable of speedy economic growth and durable financial health . 
Without determined efforts at political progress and unity , however , it will remain stuck in neutral - and could slip into reverse .
