Filling the Global Leadership Vacuum 
SEOUL - Has the world entered a new era of chaos ? 
America &apos;s vacillating policy toward Syria certainly suggests so . 
Indeed , the bitter legacy of the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan , followed by the 2008 financial crisis , has made the United States not only reluctant to use its military might , even when &quot; red lines &quot; are crossed , but also seemingly unwilling to bear any serious burden to maintain its global leadership position . 
But , if America is no longer willing to lead , who will take its place ? 
China &apos;s leaders have demonstrated their lack of interest in active global leadership by openly rejecting calls to become a &quot; responsible stakeholder &quot; in the international political and economic systems . 
Meanwhile , though Russia may wish to maintain the illusion that it is a global power , it lately seems interested primarily in thwarting America whenever possible - even when doing so is not in its own long-term interests . 
And Europe faces too many internal problems to assume any significant leadership role in global affairs . 
Unsurprisingly , this dearth of leadership has seriously undermined the effectiveness of international institutions , exemplified by the United Nations Security Council &apos;s ineffectual response to the Syria crisis and the failure of the current round of World Trade Organization ( WTO ) trade negotiations . 
This situation resembles the 1930 &quot; s - a decade when , as the economic historian Charles P. Kindleberger argued , a leadership vacuum led to the under-production of global public goods , deepening the Great Depression . 
In these circumstances , the US and China - the only viable candidates for global leadership - must achieve a grand compromise that reconciles their fundamental interests , in turn enabling them to act in concert to provide and protect global public goods . 
Only by stabilizing the bilateral Sino-American relationship can a global system that supports peace and shared prosperity be achieved . 
Such a compromise should begin with a concerted effort by the US to enhance China &apos;s role in international economic institutions like the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , and the WTO . 
While the appointment of the Chinese central banker Zhu Min as IMF Deputy Managing Director was a positive step , it has not been followed by other appointments or steps that would increase China &apos;s influence . 
Moreover , China should be included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership - the pan-Asian free-trade area that the US is now negotiating with Australia , Brunei Darussalam , Chile , Malaysia , New Zealand , Peru , Singapore , and Vietnam . 
Dividing the Asia-Pacific region into two economic blocs - one centered around China and the other around the US - will increase mistrust and encourage economic friction . 
In fact , as former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski argued at the World Peace Forum in Beijing in June , what the world really needs is a comprehensive economic partnership between the US and China . 
But such cooperation will be impossible unless the US recognizes China as an equal partner - and not just rhetorically . 
Given that the US retains a significant military advantage over China , America could support such a partnership without incurring significant security risks . 
The irony is that military superiority could weaken US leaders &quot; willingness to make the kinds of concessions , particularly with regard to security matters , that an equal partnership would require . 
But , even then , the needed adjustments could be made without compromising US security interests . 
Consider US arms sales to Taiwan . 
Given the degree of China-Taiwan cooperation nowadays , reducing such sales would be unlikely to endanger Taiwan , and doing so would contribute substantially to confidence-building between the US and China . 
The question is whether any US president , Republican or Democrat , would be willing to risk alienating those who still view Taiwan through the lens of its conflict with the People &apos;s Republic . 
The quid quo pro for these changes to US policy would be a commitment by China to respect and defend a set of international norms , principles , and institutions that was created largely without its involvement . 
Given that China &apos;s rapid GDP growth since 1979 would have been impossible without America &apos;s efforts to create an open world order , Chinese leaders should not consider this too difficult a pill to swallow . 
To be sure , China &apos;s increasingly assertive foreign policy since 2009 could indicate that , despite the universal advantages that a Sino-American leadership condominium would bring , its leaders will remain unwilling to commit to enforcing the existing global order . 
But the growing sense that this new assertiveness has backfired , increasing anxiety among China &apos;s neighbors and compelling the US to ramp up its strategic involvement in Asia , means that China could probably be convinced to reset its relationship with the US . 
Doomsayers frequently cite the wars that followed Imperial Germany &apos;s rise as a historical parallel to the Sino-American relationship today . 
But a better example - in which a global hegemon accommodates an emerging power - might be the United Kingdom &apos;s acceptance of America &apos;s rise . 
As China &apos;s leaders define the country &apos;s global role , they should bear in mind the success of the UK &apos;s approach - as well as the failure of Imperial Germany &apos;s arrogant diplomacy .
