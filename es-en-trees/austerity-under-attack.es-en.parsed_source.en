Austerity under Attack 
BRUSSELS - Europe seems to be obsessed with austerity . 
Country after country is being forced by either the financial markets or the European Union to start cutting its public-sector deficit . 
And , as if this were not enough , 25 of the 27 EU member states have just agreed on a new treaty ( called a &quot; fiscal compact &quot; ) that would oblige them never to have a cyclically adjusted budget deficit of more than 0.5 % of GDP . 
( For comparison , the United States &quot; budget deficit in 2011 was close to 8 % of GDP ) . 
But , as the European economy risks falling into recession , many observers are asking whether &quot; austerity &quot; could be self-defeating . 
Could a reduction in government expenditure ( or an increase in taxes ) lead to such a sharp decline in economic activity that revenues fall and the fiscal position actually deteriorates further ? 
This is highly unlikely , given the way our economies work . 
Moreover , if it were true , it would follow that tax cuts would reduce budget deficits , because faster economic growth would generate higher revenues , even at lower tax rates . 
This proposition has been tested several times in the US , where tax cuts were invariably followed by higher deficits . 
In Europe , the concern today is instead with the debt / GDP ratio . 
The worry here is that the GDP drop resulting from &quot; austerity &quot; might be so large that the debt ratio increases . 
This matters , because investors often use the debt ratio as an indicator of financial sustainability . 
Thus , a lower deficit might actually heighten tensions in financial markets . 
However , a lower deficit must lead over time to a lower debt ratio , even if this ratio worsens in the short run . 
After all , most models used to assess the economic impact of fiscal policy imply that a cut in expenditure , for example , lowers demand in the short run , but that the economy recovers after a while to its previous level . 
So , in the long run , fiscal policy has no lasting impact ( or only a very small one ) on output . 
This implies that whatever short-run negative impact lower demand may have on the debt ratio should be offset later ( in the medium to long run ) by the rebound in demand that brings the economy back to its previous output level . 
Moreover , even assuming that the impact of a permanent cut in public expenditure on demand and output is also permanent , the GDP reduction remains a one-off phenomenon , whereas the lower deficit continues to have a positive impact on the debt level year after year . 
Notice that this conclusion was reached without any recourse to what Paul Krugman and others have derided as the &quot; confidence fairy . &quot; 
In the US , it might indeed be unreasonable to expect that a lower deficit translates into a lower risk premium - for the simple reason that the US government pays already ultra-low interest rates . 
But , even without any confidence effects , the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office has concluded that , while cutting the US deficit does lower demand , it still leads reliably to a lower debt ratio . 
This should be all the more true for eurozone countries , like Italy or Spain , that are now paying risk premia in excess of 3-4 % . 
For these countries , the confidence fairy has become a monster . 
The decisive question then becomes : What matters more , the impact of deficit cutting on the debt / GDP ratio in the short run or in the long run ? 
Prospective buyers of Italian ten-year bonds should look at the longer-term impact of deficit cutting on the debt level , which is pretty certain to be positive . 
Of course , some market participants might not be rational , demanding a higher risk premium following a short-term deterioration of the debt ratio . 
But those concentrating on the short term risk losing money , because the risk premium will eventually decline when the debt ratio turns around . 
Abandoning austerity out of fear that financial markets might be short-sighted would only postpone the day of reckoning , because debt ratios would increase in the long run . 
Moreover , it is highly unlikely that Italy , for example , would pay a lower risk premium if it ran larger deficits . 
It would be dangerous for the eurozone &apos;s highly indebted countries to abandon austerity now . 
Any country that enters a period of heightened risk aversion with a large debt overhang faces only bad choices . 
Implementing credible austerity plans constitutes the lesser evil , even if this aggravates the cyclical downturn in the short run .
