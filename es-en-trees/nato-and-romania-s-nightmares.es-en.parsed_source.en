NATO and Romania \ u0027s Nightmares 
Hundreds of thousands of Romanians cheered President Bush as he welcomed us into NATO , and we meant it . 
Just like we meant it when we cheered Nicolae Ceausescu - both when he spoke and when he was executed . 
We are good at cheering . 
What we are not good at is understanding what we are cheering for . 
Our new NATO membership sounds great , but we really don &apos;t know why . 
In 1998 , Radu Vasile , then Romania &apos;s Prime Minister , visited Israel . 
Vasile expressed interest in purchasing Israeli military helicopters . 
Israel &apos;s President Ezer Weizmann , a former pilot , responded : &quot; You must have serious enemies if you need these helicopters . 
Who are they ? &quot; 
&quot; Not at all , &quot; Vasile answered , &quot; we &apos;re at peace with our neighbours ... our frontiers are secure . 
But we need up-to-date aircraft ... to join NATO.&apos; 
&quot; So , &quot; Weizmann said , &quot; you don &apos;t have any enemies after all ! 
But don &apos;t worry : NATO will find enemies for you ! &quot; 
Most Romanians see NATO membership as a huge national victory , but some wonder if there is truth in Weizmann &apos;s joke : because , if the rationale for entering a military alliance is that you feel threatened , entering NATO is nonsense . 
For the first time in its troubled history , Romania has nothing to fear from its neighbours . 
Russia , &quot; the hereditary enemy , &quot; now seems far away and consumed by its domestic troubles . 
Hungary , the other &quot; hereditary enemy , &quot; is a fellow NATO ally ; relations with Ukraine are nasty , but peaceful . 
Bulgaria is too small to matter ; and Yugoslavia &apos;s wars are over . 
Even so , the country must now , year after year , increase its military expenses so that it can begin to approximate NATO standards . 
That will be a hard thing to do for an economy whose recent economic growth , though real , remains shaky . 
Unlike joining the EU , which can provide important development funds , joining NATO means only sacrifice . 
Given our poverty , spending more money on military equipment seems irresponsible . 
Although 73 % of Romanians approve of entering NATO , less than 20 % agree with Romanian participation in a war against Iraq . 
No matter how inconsistent such attitudes appear to be , they remain widespread and cannot be overlooked , because they suggest that people here conceive of NATO as a protective umbrella , not something to which they must contribute . 
Romania &apos;s security problems are not external , but internal , for the enemies of Romania establishing a stable , democratic-liberal government are the Romanian people themselves . 
Democracy here is a reality , but a delicate one . 
Too many dictatorships have accustomed Romanians with habits of obedience , conformity and irresponsibility . 
The ruling PSD ( Social Democrat ) government is efficient , but has a worrying record of corruption , non-transparency , and of using its power to influence judicial decisions . 
The second largest party - Greater Romania Party - is a half-fascist , xenophobic , anti-Semitic party , whose leader - a populist radical - received 22 % of the vote in last year &apos;s elections . 
How can NATO help with this ? 
Directly , it can do nothing ; indirectly , it can do a lot . 
NATO is no longer only a military alliance . 
Instead , it is now a military-political alliance that sets democratic standards for new members and aspirants . 
No Romanian government can neglect these standards . 
Such openly thuggish rulers as Kuchma of Ukraine or Lukashenka of Belarus , are almost impossible to imagine in Romania nowadays . 
Moreover , joining NATO means subsuming Romania &apos;s military and intelligence services under NATO command ( i.e. American ) control , thus any attempt at staging a coup , or stirring up trouble between Romanians and our sizeable Hungarian minority , can be prevented . 
The more tightly bound to the democratic world a country like Romania is , the less likely it is to experience dramatic social or political unrest or to eviscerate its democratic system . 
NATO fixes hard limits on the autonomy of local political elites to do what they want . 
Of course , NATO cannot safeguard democracy alone and it is no panacea for our many social and political illnesses ; yet it can act ( and has already done so during the process of admission ) as an incentive for governments and parties to behave responsibly and to abide by the rule of law . 
This is vital because , in the past , when Romania &apos;s political elites enjoyed too much autonomy or real national sovereignty , they abused it . 
Ceausescu &apos;s rule demonstrates this . 
The &quot; room to maneuver &quot; he carved from the Warsaw Pact with the support of the West brought no benefits to the Romanian people . 
It only increased the opportunity for Ceausescu &apos;s clan and cronies to act arbitrarily , making the lives of most citizens hell . 
Comparatively , the Hungarians , the Polish and the Bulgarians , whose governments were much more dependent on the Soviets , were better off . 
So , it is not joining NATO the military alliance that will benefit Romania . 
What matters is Romania &apos;s integration into a strong international organisation , which will curb its sovereignty . 
Entering NATO marks a formal acknowledgement that Romania ( or Bulgaria , or Hungary , or Poland for that matter ) is surrendering its claims to unlimited sovereignty , and to all the dreams of grandeur that go with it . 
In the past , those dreams brought only underdevelopment , dictatorship , nationalism and untold amounts of suffering . 
Killing that dream will prevent us from reliving our political nightmares .
