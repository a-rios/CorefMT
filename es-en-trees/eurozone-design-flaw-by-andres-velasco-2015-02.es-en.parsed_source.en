The Perilous Politics of the Euro 
SANTIAGO - The jury is still out on whether Greece will manage to avoid default , remain in the eurozone , and reverse the brutal contraction of its economy . 
But any fair panel already would have issued a verdict on the political consequences of the common currency : utter failure . 
Of course , the case for the euro was always political and came in two varieties : earthy and lofty . 
The earthy case , seldom made clearly in polite company , was that the countries in southern Europe spent too much , taxed too little , and thus borrowed in excess . 
So long as they could finance deficits by printing a local currency and devaluing it from time to time , they would stick to their free-spending ways . 
Only the straightjacket of the euro and a monetary policy governed from Frankfurt could discipline them . 
That was the theory . 
The practical result was precisely the opposite . 
With the risk of devaluation gone , interest-rate spreads dropped precipitously , and so did borrowing costs . 
Cheap money from abroad flooded into Europe &apos;s lower-income countries . 
In some places - Greece , Italy , and Portugal - the money financed an unsustainable public-spending binge . 
In others - Spain and Ireland - it financed the delusions of private real-estate developers . 
Debts ballooned everywhere . 
The lofty political case for the euro was uttered most pleasingly in French . 
It promised peace , prosperity , and growing mutual respect , with political union as the ultimate goal . 
It did not matter that no one seemed to know how to get there . 
As I heard at countless conferences over the years , European will and determination would do the trick . 
As a non-European , I was told ( sometimes politely , sometimes less so ) that I could not possible understand that . 
Well , the results are now visible , and even non-Europeans can grasp what has happened . 
European institutions &apos; legitimacy is down , and neo-fascist movements are up . 
Anti-immigrant prejudices and clich√©s about tight-fisted northerners and lazy southerners proliferate . 
Even proper newspapers are not above depicting German politicians in lederhosen and Hitlerian moustaches . 
There may well be a worse outcome for the project of building an integrated and tolerant Europe , but I have trouble imagining it . 
It did not have to be this way . 
Monetary union was always a risky bet , but it did not necessarily have to produce mass unemployment ( more than half of all young people in Greece and Spain do not have a job ) . 
A significant part of the problem reflects the eurozone &apos;s flawed design , and that failure , too , is political . 
Yes , many of Greece &apos;s troubles were of its own making . 
Pension benefits have been widely abused , tax collection is a mess , and ( aside from beautiful beaches ) the country offers few goods and services that the rest of the world wants to buy . 
But the depression - now a half-decade old - also has external causes . 
Other European countries are not just buying too little from Greece ; they are buying too little everywhere . 
As Martin Wolf of the Financial Times never tires of pointing out , there is a massive imbalance in Europe , and it is not the one you might think . 
Since the current crisis erupted , the eurozone &apos;s current account has gone from a small deficit to a surplus of nearly 2.5 % of GDP . 
As countries like Greece have cut their expenditures , others , like Germany , have not expanded theirs . 
Northern Europeans are proud of living within their means - never mind that in doing so they are helping to sustain a regional crisis . 
This kind of problem already worried John Maynard Keynes at the time of the post-World War II Bretton Woods negotiations . 
Outsiders can force a country to spend less by refusing to lend to it . 
But how do you force a country or group of countries to spend more ? 
The eurozone does not have an answer for this inherently political conundrum , and therein lies one of its fundamental flaws . 
Nor does the eurozone have the automatic fiscal shock absorbers that - as is widely understood by now - are essential to stabilize incomes across the union . 
When the price of oil drops and Texas and Oklahoma fall into recession , money flows their way on a moment &apos;s notice and without any political vitriol . 
But such a transfer union will not happen as long as a single northern European citizen is left standing . 
So the eurozone will be forever plagued by economic imbalances and the political tensions that inevitably accompany them . 
And , speaking of political tensions , Greece &apos;s negotiations with the EU broke new ground . 
The new Syriza government caved after barely two weeks , when confronted with the ultimate nuclear threat : misbehave and the European Central Bank will stop funding your banks . 
Not even finance ministers in leather jackets are willing to countenance a bank run and the financial chaos that follows . 
Independent central banks are a great thing , and ECB President Mario Draghi is a great central banker . 
But that independence is meant to apply to monetary policy ( jacking up interest rates if necessary , however unpopular it may be ) and not to fiscal policy ( forcing a country to cut expenditures and raise taxes to pay outstanding debt ) . 
Did anyone say democratic deficit ? 
Of course , none of this means that Greece &apos;s exit from the eurozone would be desirable . 
As the old joke goes , if you want to go there , I wouldn &apos;t start here . 
But here - in the monetary union - is where Greece finds itself , and leaving in a lurch without a plan B would be disastrous . 
Bad economics easily turns into bad politics . 
Owing to its flawed design , the common currency now threatens to abort the very project of political union that it was meant to advance . 
Now that would be a Greek tragedy .
