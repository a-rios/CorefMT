Milosevic &apos;s Trial Was Not in Vain 
Slobodan Milosevic cheated justice , and by doing so demonstrated the futility of attempting to deal with war crimes and crimes against humanity through international prosecutions . 
That , at least , is the conclusion that some people have reached after Milosevic &apos;s death in a Hague prison : the fact that he was able to drag out his trial for four years and still escape a verdict is considered proof that the international community is wasting its resources by putting such people on trial for their misdeeds . 
Even the most dedicated partisans of international justice concede that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) has had many shortcomings . 
All those associated with it were new to such proceedings , and had to learn on the job , as there had been no such bodies since the courts at Nuremberg and Tokyo after World War II . 
Moreover , the post-WWII bodies were tribunals in which the war &apos;s victors judged the losers , and those prosecuted were already in custody . 
The ICTY , by contrast , has no capacity of its own to arrest defendants . 
It must rely on persuasion to secure cooperation by others - cooperation that is still being withheld in the case of the two most notorious defendants from the Bosnian War , Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic .. 
Until Tony Blair and Robin Cook became , respectively , Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom in 1997 , four years after the ICTY was established , NATO troops in Bosnia failed to arrest indicted suspects even when they ran into them . 
By now , of course , 133 defendants from all parties to the wars in ex-Yugoslavia have appeared before the Tribunal , charged with war crimes , crimes against humanity , and even genocide . 
These are highly complex cases , frequently involving not only novel issues under international law , but also thousands of witnesses - often traumatized by their suffering - dispersed to many lands , the constant need for high-quality simultaneous translations , and disruptive tactics by some defendants . 
Yet the proceedings against 85 of them , including appeals , have been completed . 
In trying them , the ICTY has been a model of fairness at all times . 
The mountains of evidence in its records make the horrendous crimes committed in the wars in ex-Yugoslavia comparable in the extent of their documentation to those by the Nazis . 
Inevitable efforts by demagogues to revise the history of what took place in ex-Yugoslavia in the 1990 &quot; s will be complicated by the availability of that evidence , including the facts compiled during the Milosevic trial . 
Far from being a failure , the ICTY has inspired the establishment of several other such courts , including those for Rwanda , Sierra Leone , Cambodia , and the permanent International Criminal Court . 
Even heads of state have not escaped these bodies . 
Milosevic , the former president of Yugoslavia , and then Serbia , died in prison . 
Biljana Plavsic , the President of the Bosnian Serb Republic after Karadzic , expressed remorse for her crimes , pled guilty , and is serving a prison sentence . 
Jean Kambanda , former Prime Minister of Rwanda , pled guilty to crimes against humanity and genocide and is serving a life sentence in prison . 
We are thus slowly reaching the point where some of those contemplating crimes such as those committed by Slobodan Milosevic must recognize that one day they could be held accountable . 
Charles Taylor was President of Liberia when the Tribunal for Sierra Leone indicted him . 
He had to flee his country , paving the way for the democratic transition that resulted in the recent election of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf . 
Taylor still faces the prospect of trial and , another former dictator , Saddam Hussein , is now on trial before a national court in Iraq . 
Persisting on the path of international justice will continue to require substantial resources . 
Great as they are , the costs are trivial in comparison to the expense of humanitarian aid , international military intervention , and reconstruction assistance . 
Most important , of course , is the need to prevent the suffering caused by the crimes that lead to international prosecutions ; and when those crimes cannot be prevented , we must provide some comfort and redress to the victims and their families by doing justice . 
Of course , the slow , tortuous process of international justice is often frustrating to the victims . 
In the wake of Milosevic &apos;s death , Karadzic and Mladic should be brought before the ICTY , both to reinforce its work and to demonstrate to their victims that the international community is resolved not to allow their suffering to be forgotten . 
The ICTY &apos;s mission is as valid and as vital as ever : to show that the era of impunity for some of humanity &apos;s worst crimes is coming to an end .
