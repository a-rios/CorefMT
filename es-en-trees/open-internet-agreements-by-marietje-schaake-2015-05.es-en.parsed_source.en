Safeguarding the Open Internet 
THE HAGUE - Proposals regarding Internet governance are bound to generate serious friction . 
The online world , after all , has provided enormous opportunities to billions of denizens , largely because it has never been governed . 
And yet , as the Internet grows in importance , so do the risks inherent in the lack of regulation . 
There is a growing danger that the open platform we all cherish will increasingly be colonized by corporate greed , criminal activity , and conflict between states - with ordinary citizens the ultimate victims . 
It is essential that safeguards be put in place , and that countries and companies alike are bound by principles that encourage them to act in the common interest . 
The utopian view that governments and other institutions should stay out of the way ignores the role that countries are already playing on the Internet , often secretly . 
Nor does it account for the fact that giant companies are exploiting this largely unregulated environment to set themselves up as the new sovereigns . 
When a country censors online content on a massive scale or uses digital backdoors to monitor its citizens , the entire Internet feels the impact . 
Similarly , when companies with billions of users scattered around the world suffer data breaches or choose to pursue profits at the expense of universal human rights , it is not currently clear who can hold them to account . 
Human rights cannot be &quot; balanced &quot; with the interests of states or commercial companies . 
Upholding core principles requires a system of checks and balances - mechanisms that can ensure that human rights , including privacy , are safeguarded , even as legitimate security concerns are taken into account . 
Doing this will require the key players responsible for the Internet &apos;s openness to enter into a mix of voluntary and binding agreements that establish something akin to the rule of law . 
Until now , discussions about Internet governance have aimed at establishing voluntary norms . 
These are important first steps , but if the process does not eventually lead to binding agreements , it is unlikely to succeed in keeping the Internet functioning and safe . 
Revelations of pervasive online surveillance have already eroded trust in the Internet and its suitability for communicating , accessing information , and doing business . 
It is crucial that the Internet &apos;s central protocols be declared a neutral zone , free from interference by any party , as per a recommendation by the scientific council that is advising the Dutch government . 
This measure , which will work only if it is binding , is in the interest of all countries and companies , because the trust that users have in the services built on top of these protocols depends on it . 
Among the protected elements would be TCP / IP protocol suites , various standards , the domain name system ( DNS ) , and routing protocols . 
The Global Commission on Internet Governance ( of which I am a member ) has put forward a proposal for &quot; a new social compact &quot; among citizens , their elected representatives , law-enforcement and intelligence agencies , businesses , civil-society groups , and programmers and developers . 
Among the provisions would be the recognition of privacy and personal data protection as a fundamental human right , and a call for clear , precise , and transparently created regulations that set limits on government surveillance and companies &quot; use of consumer data . 
Under this framework , governance would strengthen the technology upon which the Internet depends . 
Governments would not seek to create backdoors to access data if doing so would make the Internet less secure . Companies that store or transmit consumer data would assume greater responsibility for illegal intrusion , damage , or destruction . 
And efforts by the Internet &apos;s technical custodians to incorporate human-rights-enhancing solutions in standards and protocols , including end-to-end data encryption , would be encouraged . 
Such a social compact and multi-stakeholder process would not replace judicial oversight and international human-rights law . 
Existing governance institutions should be brought to bear on Internet regulation wherever possible . 
But , given the enormous challenges that this entails , it is also necessary to encourage all actors to behave in the best interest of the Internet ecosystem as a whole . 
The dangers of doing otherwise are simply too great .
