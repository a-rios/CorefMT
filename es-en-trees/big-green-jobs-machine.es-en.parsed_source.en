Big Green Jobs Machine 
NEW YORK - Amid the pressures of the global financial crisis , some ask how we can afford to tackle climate change . 
The better question is : how can we afford not to ? 
Put aside the familiar arguments - that the science is clear , that climate change represents an indisputable existential threat to the planet , and that every day we do not act the problem grows worse . 
Instead , let us make the case purely on bread-and-butter economics . 
At a time when the global economy is sputtering , we need growth . 
At a time when unemployment in many nations is rising , we need new jobs . 
At a time when poverty threatens to overtake hundreds of millions of people , especially in the least developed parts of the world , we need the promise of prosperity . 
This possibility is at our fingertips . 
Economists at the United Nations call for a Green New Deal - a deliberate echo of the energizing vision of United States President Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s . 
Thus , this week the UN Environment Program will launch a plan for reviving the global economy while dealing simultaneously with the defining challenge of our era - climate change . 
The plan urges world business and political leaders , including a new US president , to help redirect resources away from the speculative financial engineering at the root of today &apos;s market crisis and into more productive , growth-generating , and job-creating investments for the future . 
This new &quot; Green Economy Initiative , &quot; backed by Germany , Norway , and the European Commission , arises from the insight that the most pressing problems we face are interrelated . 
Rising energy and commodity prices helped create the global food crisis , which fed the financial crisis . 
This , in turn , reflects global economic and population growth , with resulting shortages of critical resources - fuel , food , and clean air and water . 
The commingled problems of climate change , economic growth , and the environment suggest their own solution . 
Only sustainable development - a global embrace of green growth - offers the world , rich countries as well as poor , an enduring prospect of long-term social well-being and prosperity . 
The good news is that we are awakening to this reality . 
We have experienced great economic transformations throughout history : the industrial revolution , the technology revolution , and the era of globalization . 
We are now on the threshold of another - the age of green economics . 
Visiting &quot; Silicon Valley &quot; in California last year , I saw how investment has been pouring into new renewable-energy and fuel-efficiency technologies . 
The venture capital firm that underwrote Google and Amazon , among other archetypal entrepreneurial successes , directed more than $ 100 million into new alternative energy companies in 2006 alone . 
In China , green capital investment is expected to grow from $ 170 million in 2005 to more than $ 720 million in 2008 . 
( In just a few short years , China has become a world leader in wind and solar power , employing more than a million people . ) 
Globally , the UN Environment Program estimates that investment in low-greenhouse-gas energy will reach $ 1.9 trillion by 2020 . 
The financial crisis may slow this trend . 
But capital will continue to flow into green ventures . 
I think of it as seed money for a wholesale reconfiguration of global industry . 
We can already see its practical expression . 
More than two million people in the advanced industrial nations today find work in renewable energy . 
Brazil &apos;s bio-fuels sector has been creating nearly a million jobs a year . 
Economists say that India , Nigeria , and Venezuela , among many others , could do the same . 
In Germany , environmental technology is expected to quadruple over the coming years , reaching 16 % of manufacturing output by 2030 and employing more people than the auto industry . 
Mexico already employs 1.5 million people to plant and manage the country &apos;s forests . 
Governments have a huge role to play . 
With the right policies and a global framework , we can generate economic growth and steer it in a low-carbon direction . 
Handled properly , our efforts to cope with the financial crisis can reinforce our efforts to combat climate change . 
In today &apos;s crisis lies tomorrow &apos;s opportunity - economic opportunity , measured in jobs and growth . 
Most global CEOs know this . 
That is one reason that businesspeople in so many parts of the world are demanding clear and consistent environmental policies . 
It is also the reason that global companies like General Electric and Siemens are betting their future on green . 
But it is important that the global public recognize this fact , perhaps nowhere more so than in the US . 
When the next American president takes office , voters and elected officials alike should be reassured by studies showing that the US can fight climate change by cutting emissions at low or even no cost , using only existing technologies . 
We know that the poorest of the world &apos;s poor are the people most vulnerable to climate change . 
They are also the most vulnerable to the shocks of the financial crisis . 
As world leaders , we are morally bound to ensure that solutions to the global financial crisis protect their interests , not just the citizens of wealthier nations . 
Those left behind by the previous boom - the so-called &quot; bottom billion , &quot; living on less than $ 1 a day - must be brought into the next economic era . 
Again , a solution to poverty is also a solution for climate change : green growth . 
For the world &apos;s poor , it is a key to development . 
For the rich , it is the way of the future .
