Putin &apos;s Reality Check for Europe 
BERLIN - For far too long , the West has harbored illusions about Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia - illusions that have now been shattered on the Crimean peninsula . 
The West could ( and should ) have known better : Ever since his first term in office as Russian president , Putin &apos;s strategic objective has been to rebuild Russia &apos;s status as a global power . 
To this end , Putin used Russia &apos;s energy exports to recover gradually the territories lost when the Soviet Union collapsed a generation ago . 
Ukraine has been at the heart of this strategy , because , without it , the aim of a revived Russia is unachievable . 
So Crimea was just the first target ; the next will be eastern Ukraine and persistent destabilization of the country as a whole . 
Before our eyes , the post-Soviet international system in Eastern Europe , the Caucasus , and Central Asia is being overthrown . 
Nineteenth-century concepts of international order , based on zero-sum balance-of-power considerations and spheres of interest , are threatening to supersede modern norms of national self-determination , the inviolability of borders , the rule of law , and the fundamental principles of democracy . 
As a result , this upheaval will have a massive impact on Europe and its relations with Russia , for it will determine whether Europeans live by twenty-first-century rules . 
Those who believe that the West can adapt to Russian behavior , as Putin &apos;s Western apologists suggest , risk contributing to further strategic escalation , because a soft approach will merely embolden the Kremlin . 
Indeed , whether or not its leaders acknowledge it , the European Union is now in direct conflict with Russia over its enlargement policy since the end of the Cold War . 
That is because Russia &apos;s re-emergence as a global power requires not just the reintegration of lost Soviet territories , but also direct access to Europe and a dominant role there , especially in Eastern Europe . 
So a fundamental strategic struggle is now a given . 
From a Western perspective , willful confrontation makes little sense , because the EU and Russia are and will continue to be neighbors . 
Looking ahead , Russia will need the EU even more than vice versa , because in its Far East and in Central Asia , China is emerging as a rival of entirely different dimensions . 
Moreover , Russia &apos;s rapid demographic decline and enormous modernization deficit imply the need for a joint future with Europe . 
Instead , Putin has now triggered a lasting crisis . 
The West &apos;s response will be a new containment policy , mainly taking the form of economic and diplomatic measures . 
Europe will reduce its energy dependence on Russia , review its strategic alignment and priorities , and scale back investment and bilateral cooperation . 
In the short term , Putin seems to have greater leverage , but the weakness of his position will soon become apparent . 
Russia is completely dependent , economically and politically , on its commodity and energy exports , which go primarily to Europe . 
Lower European demand and an oil price that no longer suffices to sustain Russia &apos;s budget stand to hobble the Kremlin very quickly . 
Indeed , there is reason to believe that Putin may have overplayed his hand . 
The collapse of the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1990 &quot; s was caused not by the West , but by a wave of secession , as nationalities and minorities , seeing the party-state weakened , seized the opportunity to break free . 
Today &apos;s Russia has neither the economic nor the political strength to regain and integrate the lost Soviet territories , and any attempt by Putin to press on with his plan would impoverish its people and lead to further disintegration - a bleak prospect . 
Europeans have reason to be worried , and they now have to face the fact that the EU is not just a common market - a mere economic community - but a global player , a cohesive political unit with shared values and common security interests . 
Europe &apos;s strategic and normative interests have thus re-emerged with a vengeance ; in fact , Putin has managed , almost singlehandedly , to invigorate NATO with a new sense of purpose . 
The EU will have to understand that it is not acting in a vacuum in its eastern and southern neighborhood , and that , for the sake of its own security interests , the conflicting interests of other powers there cannot simply be ignored or , worse , accepted . 
The EU &apos;s enlargement policy is not merely some expensive , expendable annoyance ; it is a vital component of the EU &apos;s security and outward projection of power . 
Safety comes with a price tag . 
Perhaps now there will be a reassessment in the United Kingdom of the costs of an EU exit . 
The EU peace project - the original impetus for European integration - may have worked too well ; after more than six decades of success , it had come to be considered hopelessly outdated . 
Putin has provided a reality check . 
The question of peace in Europe has returned , and it must be answered by a strong and united EU .
