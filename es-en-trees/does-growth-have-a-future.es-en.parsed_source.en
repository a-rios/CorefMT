Does Growth Have a Future ? 
MILAN - What can we expect as the world &apos;s economy emerges from its most serious downturn in almost a century ? 
The short answer is a &quot; new normal , &quot; with slower growth , a de-risked and more stable core financial system , and a set of additional challenges ( energy , climate , and demographic imbalances , to name a few ) with varying time horizons that will test our collective capacity to improve management and oversight of the global economy . 
Lower growth is the best guess for the medium term . 
It seems most likely , but no one really knows . 
The financial crisis , morphing quickly into a global economic downturn , resulted not just from a failure to react to growing instability , risk , and imbalance , but also from a widespread pre-crisis inability to &quot; see &quot; the rising systemic risk . 
These defining characteristics will condition the responses and the results in coming years . 
There are countervailing forces . 
The high-growth countries ( China and India ) are large and getting larger relative to the rest . 
That alone will tend to elevate global growth compared to the world where industrial countries , and the US in particular , were in the growth driving seat . 
The current crisis has come to be called a &quot; balance-sheet recession &quot; of global scope and tremendous depth and destructive power because of its origins in the balance sheets of the financial and household sectors . 
Extreme balance-sheet destruction is what made it distinctive . In the future , central banks and regulators will not be able to afford a narrow focus on ( goods and services ) inflation , growth , and employment ( the real economy ) while letting the balance-sheet side fend for itself . 
Somewhere in the system , accountability for stability and sustainability in terms of asset valuation , leverage , and balance sheets will need to be assigned and taken seriously . 
Financial re-regulation should and will emphasize capital , reserve , and margin requirements ; limiting systemic risk buildup by constraining leverage ; eliminating fragmented and incomplete regulatory coverage and regulatory arbitrage ( a huge challenge internationally ) ; and a focus on transparency . 
Isolating and further constraining a portion of the banking system , so that the channels of credit intermediation are less prone to complete and simultaneous breakdown , also seems likely . 
Relative to the recent past , the cost of capital will increase , debt will be more expensive and less ubiquitous , and risk spreads will not return to pre-crisis compressed levels . 
Assets bubbles will not disappear , but they will be less likely to be turbocharged by leverage . 
American consumers will save more and spend less , abandoning the pattern of the last few years . 
The large hole ( on the order of $ 700 billion or more ) in global aggregate demand will have to be filled over time by a compensating increase in consumption in surplus economies , such as China and Japan . 
The longer this takes , the greater the incentives at the national level to capture a share of global demand via protectionist measures . 
The recent increase in protectionist measures is an understandable political price for a range of stimulus packages in advanced and developing countries . 
But such measures may increase - and will be harder to phase out over time - in the context of a shortfall in aggregate demand . 
This is the forward-looking version of the global imbalance issue . 
Its resolution via coordinated policy action ( or a failure to resolve it through such action ) will have a huge impact ( for good or ill ) on the multinational incentive structure surrounding the global economy - and hence on its likely growth . 
Responsibility for overseeing the global economy is passing rapidly from the G-7 / 8 to the G-20 , as it should . 
The latter accounts for 90 % of global GDP and two-thirds of the world &apos;s population , so this shift is highly desirable - indeed , essential . 
But there is a risk that the interests of the remaining one-third of the world &apos;s people ( and the majority of the small countries ) will not be adequately represented as the international architecture for managing the global economy evolves . 
In the current crisis , a substantial fraction of countries outside the G-20 are essentially defenseless : small relatively poor economies , no fiscal capacity for stimulus , and inadequate reserves to offset the capital outflows that occurred to shore up damaged balance sheets in advanced markets . 
Within the G-20 countries , there are mechanisms that attend to the interests of the most vulnerable citizens . 
In the global economy , the most vulnerable are whole countries . 
Inattention to their interests is not just a moral issue , but a potentially explosive social and economic one . 
As a result , the world &apos;s international economic institutions will need to be strengthened in terms of governance and resources so that they can act as circuit-breakers in the event of future financial and economic turbulence . 
Entering the crisis , the International Monetary Fund was underfunded , and it continues to lack credibility and trust in certain systemically important parts of the world . 
It is now in the process of being better funded , but we are eight months into a crisis in which international capital flows became volatile and were driven largely by emergency responses rather than underlying economic fundamentals . 
Thus , there remains the central question of trust and confidence in the system , which have been badly damaged and will take time to rebuild . 
At the moment , the majority view in most countries is that the financial system failed badly , but that the incentives and dynamics of the broader market-based system in a relatively open global architecture remain the best avenues for wealth creation , poverty reduction , and the expansion of opportunity . 
There are , of course , dissidents , and the balance could shift quickly . 
It is not inconceivable that the baby will be thrown out with the bath water . 
There is no magic bullet for today &apos;s crisis . 
Pragmatic , steady progress at the national and international levels in improving the regulatory architecture and increasing our collective ability to avoid non-cooperative behavior and suboptimal equilibria , is the best course to follow . 
It is the course we are on . 
But for now , it is a journey without a clearly defined , widely accepted endpoint .
