Sanctions and Solidarity 
BRUSSELS - The European Union has finally agreed on its &quot; third-level sanctions &quot; against Russia for its actions in Ukraine . 
As is usual for the EU , arriving at this point has been a long and difficult process . 
A key problem all along has been that , though sanctions serve a common purpose , the costs of implementing them are borne by individual member states . 
Moreover , the costs are very concrete and visible , as jobs in enterprises that depend on exports to Russia seem to be at stake . 
So it was not surprising that many member states were more concerned about the potential cost of the sanctions on their economies than they were about the overall foreign-policy goal of signaling to Russia that its disregard of international law and norms has consequences . 
That is why a common fund to provide compensation for the economic costs of sanctions should be an integral part of the EU &apos;s emerging foreign-policy stance toward Russia . 
Creating such a fund would provide a potent symbol of solidarity within the EU , while providing an ideal opportunity to reflect on the nature of the sanctions &quot; costs . 
From an economist &apos;s perspective , a key point is that losing export sales does not represent a cost per se . 
For example , if a company that produces a generic consumer good like food , or even cars , sells less in Russia than it did before , one should not necessarily count the reduction as a loss . 
After all , if such goods have a global market , a loss of sales in one market can be compensated by higher sales in another . 
In fact , a large proportion of Russian imports from the EU are precisely of these generic consumer goods , which are not affected by sanctions . 
Thus , reports claiming that sanctions imply a high cost - because EU exports to Russia amounted to € 120 billion ( $ 161 billion ) last year and represent tens of thousands of jobs - are highly misleading . 
An economic loss arises only if a firm produces some specialized good that can be sold only in Russia using labor and capital that are also specialized and cannot be employed to produce something else . 
This applies especially to Germany : The famous German Mittelstand often does produce highly specialized goods ; but it also prides itself on its flexibility and adaptability . 
Given this , there might be a case for compensation in some cases , but it should be strictly limited in time . 
It would not be difficult to develop objective criteria for access to an EU &quot; Sanctions Compensation Fund . &quot; 
A firm could be eligible for compensation if it operated in the sectors covered by sanctions , and if the product in question had special characteristics that prevented sales from being redirected elsewhere . 
A quantitative test of eligibility could be that sales to Russia over the previous three years accounted for more than one-quarter of total sales and diminished by more than a certain percentage this year . 
Compensation would take the form of retraining programs for personnel , and maybe refinancing of loans taken to finance specialized machinery . 
But there are two sectors in which no compensation is needed : energy and finance . 
Why ? 
For starters , the risk to Europe &apos;s energy imports from Russia is negligible . 
Should Russia demand a higher price for its oil , Europe could simply turn to the global market . 
Likewise , Russian gas giant Gazprom could increase the price it charges its European customers only by breaking existing contracts . 
Moreover , Europe is the only customer for a large share of Russian gas exports , which , at least in the short run , must be transported through the existing pipelines . 
Given this , the case for compensation in the energy sector is exceptionally weak . 
Only the makers of highly specialized equipment , perhaps for exploration under Siberian conditions , might have grounds for drawing on the compensation fund . 
The case for compensation is even weaker in the European financial sector . 
Providing the kind of medium- to long-term financing that is now subject to sanctions constitutes an infinitesimal fraction of European banks &quot; business . 
Moreover , as Russia &apos;s political system becomes ever more oppressive , and its legal system ever more arbitrary , rich Russians will be more inclined than they already are to establish a safe base abroad for their wealth and families . 
The freedom and rule of law provided by financial centers such as London will become even more attractive . 
In 2006 , the EU established a &quot; Globalization Adjustment Fund &quot; to cushion those sectors hardest hit by rising imports . 
Though the Fund initially was allocated only € 500 million , a rather modest sum compared to the overall annual EU budget of around € 100 billion , its creation was an important signal of the EU &apos;s readiness to compensate those who lose out from a common policy . 
A similar political signal is needed today to overcome EU member states &quot; resistance to decisions that advance a common foreign policy . 
Here , too , the sum needed would probably be rather small compared to the overall EU budget .
