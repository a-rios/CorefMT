The Perilous Retreat from Global Trade Rules 
GENEVA - Over the last half-century , the world has been undergoing a &quot; great convergence , &quot; with per capita incomes in developing countries rising almost three times faster than those in advanced countries . Â­ But developments in 2013 revealed that the open trade regime that has facilitated this progress is now under grave threat , as stalemate in multilateral trade negotiations spurs the proliferation of &quot; preferential trade agreements &quot; ( PTAs ) , including the two biggest ever negotiated - the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) . 
The rules and norms arising from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) and its successor , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , have underpinned the export-led growth model that has enabled developing countries to lift millions of people out of poverty . 
The irony is that large developing economies &quot; rise to systemic significance is at the heart of the current deadlock in multilateral trade negotiations . 
Advanced countries argue that emerging economies should embrace reciprocity and establish trade regimes similar to their own . 
Emerging economies counter that their per capita incomes remain far lower than those of their developed counterparts , and insist that addressing their enormous development challenges demands flexibility in terms of their trade obligations . 
The resulting stalemate has impeded meaningful discussion of the main issues - including non-tariff measures , export restrictions , electronic commerce , exchange rates , and the trade implications of climate-change-related policies - raised by an open global economy . 
Against this background , mega-PTAs seem poised to re-shape world trade . 
The TPP negotiations involve a dozen Asian , Latin American , and North American countries , including Japan , Mexico , and the United States ; the TTIP would encompass the world &apos;s two largest economies , the European Union and the US ; and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) includes 16 Asia-Pacific countries . 
Japan is also developing an agreement with China and South Korea , as well as a deal with the EU . 
Such PTAs are said to have the potential to improve conditions well beyond the borders of the countries involved . 
If either the TPP or the TTIP produces meaningful reforms to trade-distorting farm subsidies - becoming the first non-multilateral agreement to do so - the benefits will be truly international . 
But the PTAs that now exist or are being negotiated focus more on regulatory issues than tariffs , and would therefore require participants to reach agreement on a wide range of rules covering , for example , investment , fair competition , health and safety standards , and technical regulations . 
This presents a number of obstacles . 
While some non-tariff measures might be easy to dismiss as protectionist , many others serve legitimate public-policy objectives , such as consumer safety or environmental protection , making it difficult to ensure that they do not conflict with the basic principles of fairness and openness . 
Moreover , such agreements can lock various groups into different regulatory approaches , raising transaction costs for domestic traders and making it difficult for external goods and services to penetrate the bloc . 
Such market segmentation could disrupt supply chains and lead to efficiency-damaging trade diversion . 
Finally , the ability of mega-PTAs to set norms that benefit non-participants might prove to be more limited than many believe . 
Transatlantic trade rules on currency valuation , for example , might leave Japan indifferent . 
And specific rules to protect intellectual property could do nothing more than prevent Brazil and India from participating . 
Overcoming these obstacles will require , first and foremost , some level of coherence among PTAs , with the various deals following roughly similar principles when addressing regulatory issues . 
Furthermore , if regionalism comes to be perceived as coercive and unfriendly , countries could form defensive trade blocs , leading to economic fragmentation and heightened security tension . 
To prevent such an outcome , the deals should be relatively open to newcomers and amenable to the possibility of &quot; multilateralization . &quot; 
But the need for policy coherence extends beyond the mega-PTAs . 
Optimal outcomes for international trade require attention at all levels to the interface between trade and a host of other policy areas . 
Consider food security . 
Effective national policies concerning land , water , and natural-resource management , infrastructure and transport networks , agricultural-extension services , land-ownership rights , energy , storage , credit , and research are as important as trade arrangements to transferring food from surplus countries to those in need . 
Likewise , regional cooperation on water and infrastructure is critical to improving diplomatic relations and establishing well-functioning markets . 
And , at the multilateral level , agricultural production and trade is influenced by policies on subsidies , tariffs , and export restrictions ( although the latter are not currently governed by strict WTO rules ) . 
Despite the great value of regional cooperation and coherent national policies , a functional multilateral trade system remains vital . 
In order to reinvigorate multilateral trade cooperation , governments must work together to address unresolved issues from the Doha agenda , such as agricultural subsidies and tariff escalation . 
To be sure , the agreement reached at the WTO &apos;s recent ministerial conference in Bali represents a boon for world trade and multilateral cooperation . 
But governments must expand the agenda to include guidelines aimed at ensuring that mega-PTAs do not lead to economic fragmentation . 
Future WTO rules on export restrictions could help to stabilize international markets for agricultural commodities . 
Trade in services could be liberalized further , and industrial subsidies could prevent countries &quot; green-innovation objectives from getting lost amid pressure to boost employment at home . 
Moreover , global rules on investment could enhance the efficiency of resource allocation , while international guidelines for competition policy would serve the interests of consumers and most producers more effectively than the existing patchwork system . 
Increased cooperation with the International Monetary Fund on exchange-rate issues , and with the International Labor Organization on labor standards , could diminish trade tensions and enhance trade &apos;s contribution to improving people &apos;s lives . 
A shared strategy for addressing non-tariff measures would help countries to avoid unnecessary trade friction . 
And new developments in energy production might facilitate more meaningful international cooperation on energy trade and investment . 
All of this would require that emerging economies accept eventual alignment of their trade commitments with those of advanced economies , and that advanced countries accept that emerging countries deserve long transition periods . 
In 2014 and beyond , all parties must recognize that , in a multipolar world , an international trading system based on an updated set of rules is the least risky means of pursuing their growth objectives . 
The recent WTO agreement reached in Bali on streamlining border protocols , among other issues , shows that important steps in this direction can indeed be taken .
