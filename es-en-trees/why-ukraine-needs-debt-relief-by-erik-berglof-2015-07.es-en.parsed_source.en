Why Ukraine Deserves a Haircut 
LONDON - In addition to its many other troubles , Ukraine now finds itself in a showdown with its creditors . 
Investors holding high-yielding bonds - many of them bought at heavy discounts after Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea last year - are demanding to be paid in full . 
Ukraine &apos;s government , for its part , argues that the country &apos;s financial difficulties - in particular the economic effects of the conflict and the plunge in the value of the hryvnia - have made its debt burden unsustainable . 
The outcome of this standoff could determine Ukraine &apos;s future , as much as the military confrontation with Russia . 
Recent developments have put the country on a path that would have been unimaginable until very recently . 
For the first time in Ukraine &apos;s post-Soviet history , it has a government that is willing and able to carry out real reform . 
Ukraine &apos;s progress , however , could not be more fragile . 
Without some form of debt relief , it could easily be lost . 
A little over a year ago , Ukraine did not have an elected president or a representative and functioning parliament . 
The political landscape was deeply fragmented . 
Civil society had been energized by the Maidan revolution that ousted former President Viktor Yanukovych , but it was in turmoil . 
Debate over the association agreement with the European Union , along with the Russian-backed rebellion in the east , had stoked tensions over distinctions that previously played little or no role in people &apos;s lives . 
But since parliamentary elections in October , Ukraine has begun to pull itself together . 
Russia &apos;s intervention has to some extent backfired , strengthening support for a European orientation . 
Eastern Ukraine may have voted differently from the rest of the country , but the overwhelming majority of voters came out in favor of Europe . 
The electorate also said no to the more virulent forms of nationalism , leaving the right-wing extremist parties marginalized . 
The result of the elections was the formation of a five-party governing coalition . 
Though seemingly fragile , it has held up remarkably well . 
Some of its members have displayed worrying populist tendencies , but an analysis of parliamentary voting patterns indicates that so far the coalition has been able to find agreement , even on very difficult issues . 
The government has , among other things , raised gas tariffs by 450 % ( from absurdly low levels ) . 
Dissension has been relatively moderate . 
As a result , Ukraine &apos;s core institutions are undergoing fundamental change . 
The central bank - once in the pocket of the country &apos;s oligarchs , supplying inside information on exchange rates and liquidity in exchange for bribes - has been put under the command of a governor committed to reform , surrounded by an increasingly professional team . 
The energy monopoly Naftogaz , previously a cesspool of illicit transactions , has in a year managed the seemingly impossible : making Ukraine virtually independent from direct gas delivery from Russia for at least a year . 
Perhaps Ukraine &apos;s single most important achievement is the establishment of the National Reform Council . 
Originally set up to coordinate reforms across ministries and monitor their implementation , it has come to serve as an important tool to discuss and ensure coherence among the different branches of government . 
This latter role is particularly important , given the constitutional ambiguity created by the reversion back to a parliamentary system and the uneasy co-habitation of President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in government . 
Meetings are held every three weeks and are attended by the president , the prime minister , and his entire cabinet , providing a forum in which tensions can be discussed and eased . 
In between meetings , the council &apos;s special project-management office assists in the preparation and implementation of key reforms by ministries . 
With support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the George Soros-funded International Renaissance Foundation , and bilateral assistance from , among others , the Swedish government , the office has been able to hire staff at market rates , raising the quality of the government administration . 
Ukraine &apos;s government has also benefited from the expertise of private-sector leaders . 
Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Dmytro Shymkiv , who drove the National Reform Council , was CEO of Microsoft Ukraine . 
Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko and Economic Development and Trade Minister Aivaras Abromavicius were both investment bankers ( neither was a Ukrainian citizen when they joined the government ) . 
Infrastructure Minister Andriy Pivovarsky , also a former investment banker , was most recently CEO of Continium , one of the country &apos;s largest holding companies . 
Each has played a key role in pushing the reform agenda forward , working for salaries that are orders of magnitude smaller than what they earned before . 
Some have even employed staff using their own money . 
Meanwhile , the ambitious agendas of the government ministers and the presidential administration are closely monitored by an energized civil society . 
As Soros has noted , Ukraine probably has the most active civil society in Europe . 
One of the country &apos;s most interesting new ventures is VoxUkraine , a blogging platform set up by two Ukrainian economics professors based in the United States , Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Timofiy Mylovanov . 
They have championed modern evidence-based decision-making and constantly come up with new , constructive ways of challenging the government and its assumptions . 
Despite all this progress , however , the odds remain stacked against the country . 
The government is fighting at least two wars simultaneously - taking on a deeply entrenched oligarchy , while trying to fend off its hostile eastern neighbor . 
Further trouble - in the form a steeply declining economy - is something it cannot afford . 
The stakes could not be higher . 
For the first time since the country gained its independence in 1992 , Ukraine has a clear sense of direction and a government capable of supporting reform . 
There are signs that the oligarchs &quot; grip is beginning to loosen , owing partly to internal conflicts among them . 
The EU and the US are working to help resolve its conflict with Russia . 
Ukraine &apos;s private creditors must now do their part , recognize the country &apos;s economic and political situation , and accept a haircut on their bonds . 
Neither the Ukrainian economy - nor its political system - can afford that they do otherwise .
