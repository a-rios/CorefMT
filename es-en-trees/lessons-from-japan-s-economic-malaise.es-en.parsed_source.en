Lessons from Japan \ u0027s Economic Malaise 
Japan &apos;s economy has been in a state of malaise - slow growth alternating with recession - for over a decade , with intense debate meeting policy vacillation . 
Some , for instance , prescribe budget deficits to stimulate the economy ; others , remembering the Clinton Administration &apos;s claim that fiscal consolidation underpinned the US recovery in 1993 , argue for deficit reduction . 
Similarly , some argue that the country needs a mild dose of inflation , while Japan &apos;s central bank continues to resist the very idea that inflation could ameliorate any economic problem . 
Confusion about what cure to prescribe is caused in part by the fact that different medicines are suited for different problems , whereas much of the policy debate fails to distinguish among them adequately . 
As one of President Clinton &apos;s economic advisers during the critical period of America &apos;s economic recovery , I feel obligated to point out that circumstances in the US in the early 1990 &apos;s were unique . 
Normally , deficit reduction in an economic downturn makes a downturn worse - just as the British economist John Maynard Keynes demonstrated 70 years ago . 
Indeed , thanks to the IMF , we have had ample opportunity to see what happens , both in East Asia and Latin America , when an economy in a downturn tries to balance its budget . 
The reason deficit reduction worked in the US in 1993 was that America &apos;s banks , whose balance sheets were weak , had large holdings of long-term bonds , the value of which increased as long-term interest rates fell . 
The fall in interest rates , which spurred business investment , was in part due to the long-term deficit reduction strategy . 
Today , Japan faces a problem of deflation , not inflation . 
During the Great Depression , the great American economist Irving Fisher focused on the adverse effects of falling prices . 
My own work , with Bruce Greenwald of Columbia University , updates these theories , taking into account the imperfections of capital markets , especially those associated with asymmetries of information . 
Keynes worried about price rigidities - the failure of prices and wages to fall when there is excess supply of labor or goods . 
Keynes &apos; colleague at Cambridge University , A.C. Pigou , voiced the standard theory of the time : if wages and prices fell sufficiently , then consumers with money would eventually feel well enough off ( given how cheap everything had become ) that they would start to spend , rejuvenating the economy . 
Keynes famously retorted that in the long run we are all dead . 
Fisher &apos;s criticism , however , was even more devastating - and more relevant to Japan &apos;s current circumstances : as prices fall , debtors , whose obligations are fixed in nominal terms ( that is , in terms of yen ) find it increasingly difficult to repay what they owe . 
In real terms , they are forced to pay back more and more to their creditors . 
Some debtors default - the debtor problems then become the banks &apos; problem - while others are forced to cut back their expenditures , deepening the downturn . 
Falling prices also mean that even when the nominal interest rate is very low , the real interest rate , taking into account the deflation , may be significantly higher , so investment , too , is discouraged . 
In short , falling prices worsen the economy &apos;s situation in the short run . 
How can Japan &apos;s deflation be reversed ? 
Assume that the Japanese government financed its deficit partly by printing money rather than borrowing . 
Some individuals and firms who receive this money might simply hold on to the newly minted yen , but others might choose to spend it on goods and services , thereby stimulating the economy . 
Similarly , higher deposits might simply add to some banks &apos; excess liquidity , but others might find it attractive to lend more , providing a further economic boost . 
A carefully paced program could add enough to aggregate demand to pick up the slack in the economy , and reverse deflation , setting into motion a virtuous cycle . 
Higher prices would make debtors better off , and they might as a result begin to spend more . 
More debtors would be able to repay their loans , which might lead the banks to lend more . 
Meanwhile , the yen would weaken , helping exports , and even if the real exchange rate did not change much , given Japan &apos;s position as a major creditor , the yen value of its foreign holdings would increase , providing still more economic stimulus . 
Of course , those infected with inflation paranoia might worry : won &apos;t such a policy simply lead to an inflationary spiral ? 
There is no economic research that supports such worries . 
For countries with low to moderate inflation , moderate increases in inflation do not lead to runaway inflation , regardless of what central bankers may say on the matter . 
To be sure , if Japan &apos;s government started printing money recklessly - as some countries have done in the past - such worries would be well grounded . 
But the Japanese government has shown a remarkable record of fiscal responsibility , and could even calibrate the fraction of the deficit financed by issuing money . 
What would be the impact on confidence in the Japanese economy of such fiscal stimulus ? 
There is nothing that undermines confidence in an economy so much as recessions ; and there is nothing that undermines confidence in a government &apos;s ability to manage the economy so much as ongoing failure to address either the extremes of inflation or persistent stagnation . 
Restoring growth would be good for Japan , good for Asia , and good for the world economy . 
Perhaps more importantly , the lessons gleaned from a policy of determined stimulus would be invaluable for other countries facing similar problems .
