Europe &apos;s Sovereignty Crisis 
BERLIN - Finally , German Chancellor Angela Merkel has accepted a new form of European Union . 
More than ever , the EU must combine greater stability , financial transfers , and mutual solidarity if the entire European project is to be prevented from collapsing under the weight of the ongoing sovereign-debt crisis . 
For a long time , Merkel fought this new EU tooth and nail , because she knows how unpopular it is in Germany - and thus how politically dangerous it is to her electoral prospects . 
She wanted to defend the euro , but not to pay the price for doing so . 
That dream is at an end , thanks to the financial markets . 
The markets issued an ultimatum to Europe : either embrace more economic and financial integration on a federal basis , or face the collapse of the euro and thus the EU , including the Common Market . 
At the last moment , Merkel chose the sensible option . 
Had the European Council &apos;s heads of state and government taken this foreseeable decision a year ago , the euro crisis would not have escalated to the extent that it has , the total bill would have been lower , and European leaders would have been rightly praised for a historic feat . 
But , as I said , back then Merkel did not dare to act . 
The agreement at the most recent European Council will be more expensive , both politically and financially . 
Despite doubling financial aid and lowering interest rates , the agreement will neither end the Greek debt crisis and that of other countries on the European periphery , nor stop the EU &apos;s associated existential crisis . 
Further aid packages for Greece may seem impossible to avoid , because the losses imposed on Greek debt holders have been too modest . 
Other crisis countries in the eurozone have not been stabilized , because Germany - fearing a domestic political backlash - has not dared to embrace a community of liability by issuing Eurobonds , even if the European Financial Stability Facility &apos;s new role means that virtually 90 % of the path has already been traveled . 
Once again , there has been no success in boosting confidence in the face of the dynamics of this crisis . 
But the bail-in of private investors , much applauded in Germany , is of secondary importance , and is intended only for the German public and the MPs of the country &apos;s government coalition ; indeed , upon close inspection , it turns out that banks and insurance companies have made a decent profit . 
Still , the single currency &apos;s collapse was avoided , and French President Nicolas Sarkozy was right to laud the establishment of a &quot; European Monetary Fund &quot; as a real achievement . 
But this bold move has huge political consequences that have to be explained to the public , because the move toward establishing such a fund - and , with it , a European economic government - amounts to an EU political revolution in three acts . 
First , the two-speed Union , which has been a reality since the first rounds of enlargement , will divide into a vanguard ( euro group ) and a rearguard ( the rest of the 27 EU members ) . 
This formalized division will fundamentally change the EU &apos;s internal architecture . 
Under the umbrella of the enlarged EU , the old dividing lines between a German / French-led European Economic Community and a British / Scandinavian-led European Free Trade Association re-emerge . 
From now on , the euro states will determine the EU &apos;s fate more than ever , owing to their common interests . 
Second , this jump into a monetary fund and economic government will lead to further massive losses of sovereignty for the member states , in favor of a European federal solution . 
For example , within the monetary union , national budget laws will be subject to a European supervisory body . 
Finally , it follows that in the future , Merkel and Sarkozy , in particular , will have to struggle a lot more than before for electoral majorities . 
If the euro is to survive , genuine integration , with further transfers of sovereignty to the European level , will be unavoidable . 
This historic step cannot be taken through the bureaucratic backdoor , but only in the bright light of democratic politics . 
The EU &apos;s further federalization enforces its further democratization . 
If the eurozone is to endure , a majority of its citizens , especially in Germany and France , must embrace the euro as their currency . 
This is not a technocratic issue , but a profoundly political and democratic one . 
To paraphrase Bill Clinton : &quot; It &apos;s the sovereignty , stupid ! &quot; 
Therefore , the first step must be to ensure a strong role for national parliaments in this process . 
In Germany , there has been a broad consensus for a stability union , but not for a transfer or liability union . 
From now on , governments will have to fight for majorities supporting the euro . 
This is good , because only then will a reliable democratic consensus on Europe &apos;s future be reached . 
The German chancellor and the French president will have to present their policies openly and fight for further integration and the single currency . 
The outcome will decide their fate and continuance in office . 
Whether they succeed is anything but certain , given the current state of European public opinion .
