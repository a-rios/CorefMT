Heeding History in East Asia 
SEOUL - Chinese , South Korean , and Japanese diplomats recently took to the podium of the United Nations General Assembly to reassert their countries &quot; positions on the territorial issues surrounding several small islands in the seas of East Asia . 
At the center of one heated dispute , between China and Japan , are the Senkaku Islands , which the Chinese call the Diaoyu Islands . 
In September , Japan &apos;s government announced its purchase of three of the islands from their private Japanese owner , inciting protests across China . 
Soon after , hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels approached the islands to assert China &apos;s sovereignty . 
These vessels have lately been joined by an increasing number of Chinese surveillance forces , which periodically enter the waters surrounding the islands , sometimes leading to direct confrontation with Japanese patrol ships . 
With the situation threatening to escalate further , both sides need to contain the conflict quickly and restore the status quo . 
Indeed , the situation is all the more volatile in view of the political transition now underway in China . 
Meanwhile , the Republic of Korea and Japan are engaged in a territorial standoff over the islets of Dokdo ( called Takeshima in Japanese ) . 
In early August , Lee Myung-bak became the first South Korean president to visit the islets ; 
But the ICJ cannot exercise jurisdiction in the dispute without both countries &quot; consent , and South Korea has rejected Japan &apos;s proposal , maintaining that Lee was within his authority to visit the islets , given that Dokdo is unquestionably South Korean territory . 
Indeed , South Korea &apos;s government denies that there is any dispute over the islands . 
Historical context is crucial to assessing the Dokdo issue . 
Like the rest of Korea , Dokdo was annexed by Japan in the early twentieth century , and restored to Korean control after World War II , when Korea regained its independence . 
Thus , while outsiders might view the desolate islands as insignificant , for Koreans , Japan &apos;s position on Dokdo is tantamount to a challenge to their country &apos;s independence and a denial of its right to exercise sovereignty over its own territory . 
As a result , Dokdo has been a thorn in relations between the two countries for decades . 
In 2005 , the creation of a so-called &quot; Takeshima Day &quot; by a local government in Japan triggered a public uproar in South Korea . 
Furthermore , Japan &apos;s habit of distorting facts in its history books - for example , denying that its former colonial subjects were forced into sexual slavery - has fueled distrust and anger in South Korea and elsewhere in East Asia , including China . 
Dokdo is situated midway between the Korean peninsula and Japan &apos;s main island , roughly 115 nautical miles from each . 
A survey of historical documents shows a distinct shift in Japan &apos;s position on Dokdo . 
For example , in the late seventeenth century , when conflict between Korea and Japan erupted over the passage of Japanese fishermen to Ulleungdo , Tottori-han ( one of Japan &apos;s feudal clans ) told Japan &apos;s central government that Ulleungdo and Dokdo did not fall within Japanese territory . 
Likewise , a report in 1870 by Japan &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs , &quot; A Confidential Inquiry into the Particulars of Korea &apos;s Foreign Relations , &quot; shows that the ministry recognized Dokdo as Korean territory . 
Indeed , the report includes the subject title &quot; How Takeshima and Matsushima Came to Belong to Joseon &quot; ( later renamed Korea ) . 
Moreover , the Dajokan , Japan &apos;s highest decision-making body in 1868-1885 , denied any claims of sovereignty over Dokdo through its Order of 1877 . 
Yet , in 1905 , Japan took measures to incorporate Dokdo in order to use it as a strategic military site for its war with Russia . 
The final text of the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty , which ended WWII in the Pacific , makes no mention of Dokdo . 
The reference in the final version , drafted by the United States , was removed in light of US interests in building strategic partnerships with both South Korea and Japan . 
However , the 1943 Cairo Declaration , which stipulated the Allied Powers &quot; basic position on Japan &apos;s territorial boundaries after WWII , stated that Japan would be expelled from all territories that it had annexed through violence . 
In this context , the unconditional return of Dokdo to Korea - and Korea &apos;s continued sovereignty over Dokdo - is indisputable . 
In an increasingly interconnected world , significant challenges can be addressed only through regional and global partnerships . 
Regional leaders must not get caught up in finger-pointing or avoid taking responsibility for past transgressions . 
An honest evaluation of history is crucial to establishing lasting peace and prosperity in East Asia .
