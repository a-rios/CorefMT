The Derivatives Market &apos;s Helpful Enemies 
CHICAGO - The launch of two European antitrust investigations into the market for credit default swaps ( CDS ) might appear to be no more than a political vendetta against one of the alleged culprits behind the 2010 European sovereign-debt crisis . 
The negative perception that most people ( especially in Europe ) have of CDS has certainly played a role here . 
After all , foreigners and politically weak companies are often the favorite targets of law enforcement . 
Consider , for example , that the first insider-trading case tried in Russia after the fall of communism was against an American firm . 
Likewise , the European Union &apos;s antitrust authorities have been tougher with Microsoft than with many European firms . 
That said , the existence of political motivations does not undermine the legitimacy of the new EU investigations , which will be conducted alongside an ongoing inquiry by the United States Justice Department into anti-competitive practices in the trading , clearing , and pricing of CDS in the US . 
In fact , the ideological bias of Europeans against CDS might be beneficial in the long term for the development of a better market for CDS , and for derivatives in general . 
Indeed , today the market for derivatives is oligopolistic , with a few banks running huge profit margins . 
And , regardless of whatever political motivations might lie behind the latest investigations , this market concentration is a real problem . 
According to a 2009 study by the European Central Bank , the five largest CDS dealers were party to almost half of the total outstanding notional amounts , while the 10 largest CDS dealers accounted for 72 % of the trades . 
The markets for other derivatives are not much better . 
A high degree of concentration distorts the market in several ways . 
First , when they transact among themselves , large players do not insist on an adequate amount of collateral , relying on the counterparty &apos;s generic creditworthiness ( and on the implicit guarantees that governments provided to large firms ) . 
Not only does this severely undermine the ability of small firms to compete , but it also contributes to systemic instability of the type that we experienced in 2008 , thus increasing the likelihood that taxpayers will have to step in . 
Market concentration renders mostly illusory the beneficent risk-spreading role that is claimed for derivatives , because the bulk of the risk is borne by very few players . 
Over-the-counter trading also contributes to the opacity of derivatives markets , further reducing competition and increasing the margin enjoyed by the traders - and the prices that final users ( mostly industrial firms ) must pay . 
The combined profits of the key players in this market total $ 80 billion , which represents a massive tax on the real economy . 
To fix this problem , we need to move the bulk of derivative trading onto organized exchanges , where daily collateral requirements would guarantee systemic stability , and price transparency would force competition , reduce margins , and increase the market &apos;s depth . 
In the United States , the Dodd-Frank Act moves some of the way in this direction , and similar efforts are underway in Europe . 
Nevertheless , the journey is still a long one . 
The major investment banks are fully aware that every day that they delay appropriate market regulation , they earn millions of dollars for their managers &quot; bonus funds . 
It is no surprise that the reform process is taking so long . 
According to European Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres , the latest efforts at antitrust enforcement can be seen as complementing pending derivatives regulation . 
To overcome the enormous lobbying power of investment banks - and thus help to ensure global financial stability - any tool is helpful , even if it comes wrapped in a package of European ideological bias .
