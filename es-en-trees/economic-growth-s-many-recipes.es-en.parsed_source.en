Economic Growth &apos;s Many Recipes 
CAMBRIDGE , MA .  -  
From the so-called &quot; Big Push &quot; to &quot; Balanced Growth , &quot; from the &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; to &quot; Second Generation Reforms , &quot; the emphasis has been on wholesale change . 
Today &apos;s fashion in development is no different . 
The prevailing obsession with the &quot; governance &quot; agenda entails a broad-based effort to remold institutions in developing societies as a prerequisite for economic growth . 
The United Nations Millennium Project involves a large-scale , coordinated big push of investment in human capital , public infrastructure , and agricultural technologies . 
But there have also been iconoclastic dissenters from such comprehensive approaches , among whom Albert Hirschman was without doubt the most distinguished . 
Indeed , Hirschman &apos;s seminal contributions have now been recognized by the United States Social Science Research Council , which this year established a prize in his honor . 
Hirschman &apos;s interests shifted away from economic development over the course of his illustrious career . 
But when he was still involved in development debates , he would frequently remind his contemporaries that any country that had the capacity to undertake comprehensive programs would not be underdeveloped to begin with . 
Indeed , he once chided John Kenneth Galbraith for enunciating a long list of prerequisites for foreign aid to be effective . 
If developing countries could meet these conditions , he wrote , they would be in a position to send foreign aid to the United States ! 
Hirschman believed that the possibilities for economic development are not nearly as constrained as comprehensive theories would lead us to believe . 
The imbalances specific to underdevelopment create opportunities that policymakers can seize on . 
Instead of relying on fads emanating from abroad , we need to experiment and look for the unique solutions that will allow us to circumvent ingrained social structures that inhibit growth . 
Hirschman &apos;s central insights on development have held up extremely well . 
The key lesson of the last half-century is that policymakers must be strategic , rather than comprehensive . 
They have to do the best with what they have instead of wishing they could transform their society wholesale . 
They need to identify priorities and opportunities , and work on them . 
They must seek sequential , cumulative change rather than a single , all-inclusive breakthrough . 
Successful countries do share some common features . 
They all provide some degree of effective property rights protection and contract enforcement , maintain macroeconomic stability , seek to integrate into the world economy , and ensure an appropriate environment for productive diversification and innovation . 
But how these ends are achieved differs . 
For example , greater integration with world markets can be achieved via export subsidies ( South Korea ) , export-processing zones ( Malaysia ) , investment incentives for multinational enterprises ( Singapore ) , special economic zones ( China ) , regional free trade agreements ( Mexico ) , or import liberalization ( Chile ) . 
The best-designed policies are always contingent on local conditions , making use of pre-existing advantages and seeking to overcome domestic constraints . 
That is why successful reforms often do not travel well . 
Reforms , after all , are not hothouse plants that can be transplanted at will in any soil . 
Moreover , generating economic growth requires hitting the right targets , not doing everything at once . 
What matters at any point in time is to alleviate a society &apos;s immediate binding constraints - another reason why different policies are needed for different places . 
China was constrained by poor supply incentives in agriculture in the late 1970 &quot; s . 
Today &apos;s Brazil is constrained by inadequate supply of credit . 
El Salvador is constrained by inadequate production incentives in tradable goods . 
Zimbabwe is constrained by poor governance . 
These problems all require different methods for unlocking growth . 
What we need is selective , well-targeted reforms , not a laundry list . 
Countries run into trouble when they do not use high-growth periods to strengthen their institutional underpinnings . 
Two kinds of institutions in particular need shoring up : conflict management institutions to enhance economies &quot; resilience to external shocks , and institutions that promote productive diversification . 
Growth collapsed in Africa in the late 1970 &quot; s because of the weakness of the former , and fizzled in Latin America after the first half of the 1990 &quot; s because of the weakness of the latter . 
This line of thinking has vast implications for the design of appropriate global economic arrangements . 
Hirschman would be aghast at the extent of intrusion into domestic policymaking that the World Trade Organization or the International Monetary Fund engage in nowadays . 
As international bureaucracies with a penchant for &quot; best practices &quot; and common standards , these institutions are woefully unsuited to the task of seeking innovative , unique pathways suited to each country &apos;s particular circumstances . 
But Hirschman also would no doubt chide developing country governments for not living up to their responsibilities and for passing on the buck so freely to these external agencies . 
For , ultimately , it is up to each country to say , &quot; Thanks , but no , thanks ; we &apos;ll do it our way . &quot; 
Many economists were skeptical about Hirschman &apos;s approach because they could not quite fit it into the economics they had been trained to practice . 
But , over the years , economics has become richer , too . 
Dynamic models have become much more common , an economics of the &quot; second-best &quot; has flourished , political economy has become mainstream , and behavioral economics has thrown the &quot; rational actor &quot; into doubt . 
As a result , Hirschman looks less and less the maverick that he fancied himself to be . 
Conventional wisdom may finally be catching up with him .
