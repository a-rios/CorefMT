The Unstarvable Beast 
CAMBRIDGE - As the world watches the United States grapple with its fiscal future , the contours of the battle reflect larger social and philosophical divisions that are likely to play out in various guises around the world in the coming decades . 
There has been much discussion of how to cut government spending , but too little attention has been devoted to how to make government spending more effective . 
And yet , without more creative approaches to providing government services , their cost will continue to rise inexorably over time . 
Any service-intensive industry faces the same challenges . 
Back in the 1960 &quot; s , the economists William Baumol and William Bowen wrote about the &quot; cost disease &quot; that plagues these industries . 
The example they famously used was that of a Mozart string quartet , which requires the same number of musicians and instruments in modern times as it did in the nineteenth century . 
Similarly , it takes about the same amount of time for a teacher to grade a paper as it did 100 years ago . 
Good plumbers cost a small fortune , because here , too , the technology has evolved very slowly . 
Why does slow productivity growth translate into high costs ? 
The problem is that service industries ultimately have to compete for workers in the same national labor pool as sectors with fast productivity growth , such as finance , manufacturing , and information technology . 
Even though the pools of workers may be somewhat segmented , there is enough overlap that it forces service-intensive industries to pay higher wages , at least in the long run . 
The government , of course , is the consummate service-intensive sector . 
Government employees include teachers , policemen , trash collectors , and military personnel . 
Modern schools look a lot more like those of 50 years ago than do modern manufacturing plants . 
And , while military innovation has been spectacular , it is still very labor-intensive . 
If people want the same level of government services relative to other things that they consume , government spending will take up a larger and larger share of national output over time . 
Indeed , not only has government spending been rising as a share of income ; so , too , has spending across many service sectors . 
Today , the service sector , including the government , accounts for more than 70 % of national income in most advanced economies . 
Agriculture , which in the 1800 &quot; s accounted for more than half of national income , has shrunk to just a few percent . 
Manufacturing employment , which accounted for perhaps a third of jobs or more before World War II , has shrunk dramatically . 
In the US , for example , the manufacturing sector employs less than 10 % of all workers . 
So , even as economic conservatives demand spending cuts , there are strong forces pushing in the other direction . 
Admittedly , the problem is worse in the government sector , where productivity growth is much slower even than in other service industries . 
Whereas this might reflect the particular mix of services that governments are asked to provide , that can hardly be the whole story . 
Surely , part of the problem is that governments use employment not just to provide services , but also to make implicit transfers . 
Moreover , government agencies operate in many areas in which they face little competition - and thus little pressure to innovate . 
Why not bring greater private-sector involvement , or at least competition , into government ? 
Education , where the power of modern disruptive technologies has barely been felt , would be a good place to start . 
Sophisticated computer programs are becoming quite good at grading middle-school essays , if not quite up to the standards of top teachers . 
Infrastructure is another obvious place to expand private-sector involvement . 
Once upon a time , for example , it was widely believed that drivers on privately operated roads would constantly be waiting to pay tolls . 
Modern transponders and automatic payment systems , however , have made that a non-issue . 
But one should not presume that a shift to greater private-sector provision of services is a panacea . 
There would still be a need for regulation , especially where monopoly or near-monopoly is involved . 
And there would still be a need to decide how to balance efficiency and equity in the provision of services . 
Education is clearly an area in which any country has a strong national interest in providing a level playing field . 
As US President in the 1980 &quot; s , the conservative icon Ronald Reagan described his approach to fiscal policy as &quot; starve the beast &quot; : cutting taxes will eventually force people to accept less government spending . 
In many ways , his approach was a great success . 
But government spending has continued to grow , because voters still want the services that government provides . 
Today , it is clear that reining in government also means finding ways to shape incentives so that innovation in government keeps pace with innovation in other service sectors . 
Without more ideas about how to innovate in the provision of government services , battles such as one sees playing out in the US today can only become worse , as voters are increasingly asked to pay more for less . 
Politicians can and will promise to do a better job , but they cannot succeed unless we identify ways to boost government services &quot; efficiency and productivity .
