The Long-Term Investment Challenge 
PARIS - As the deepest economic crisis of our lifetimes stretches into its seventh year , most OECD countries are continuing to underperform . 
This year , GDP growth in the world &apos;s advanced economies is expected to average 2 % , compared to 3.2 % worldwide . 
But the long-term economic prospects of the global economy as a whole look gloomy . 
As societies in many OECD countries age , and catch-up growth in large emerging economies begins to wind down , global GDP growth is expected to fall from its annual average of 3.6 % in the 2010-2020 period to an estimated 2.4 % in 2050-2060 . 
This slump may be inevitable , but it can be mitigated . 
Implementing policies to facilitate and reward long-term investments will be key to exiting the current crisis and boosting the world &apos;s growth potential . 
Investments , both public and private , are needed to foster green growth , support innovation and entrepreneurship , contribute to closing the inequality gaps that have widened during the crisis , and help build the skills that are essential for more resilient economies and more inclusive societies . 
And , though meeting these needs will require transformational changes in the behavior of governments and investors , the payoff will be significant . 
In short , as we argued during the OECD Forum and annual Ministerial Council Meeting last week , this time we need to promote investments that focus on people and the planet . 
The list of structural challenges facing countries around the globe is a long one . 
Addressing the unemployment crisis , which has been particularly burdensome for the young , will require not only a strong recovery , but also a renewed focus on the development of skills . 
Investment in high-quality vocational education and training and work-based learning will be essential . 
These types of investments continue to be beneficial throughout a worker &apos;s life , as exposure to new skills and knowledge allows him or her to adapt to an evolving technological and business environment . 
Empowering today &apos;s workers will also help meet the challenges resulting from aging populations . 
Moreover , an increased focus on long-term investment will help resolve the conflicts traditionally associated with addressing climate change and building infrastructure . 
One requires cuts in the emission of greenhouse gases ; the other has tended to promote the combustion of fossil fuels for transport and energy . 
The solution is relatively simple , provided the presence of political will : By putting a price on carbon and repealing policies that incentivize fossil-fuel consumption , investments can be channeled into the creation of a low-carbon economy , including the necessary clean-energy infrastructure . 
In order to encourage private investors to pursue long-term , responsible projects , governments need to promote consistent policies and frameworks . 
In addition to immediate uncertainties , investors are being held back by a shortage of incentives and a surplus of factors that reduce returns . 
These include restrictive regulations that reduce firms &quot; ability to undertake new activities or enter new markets , especially across borders . 
The OECD &apos;s updated Policy Framework for Investment provides a blueprint for the promotion of investment and responsible business conduct . 
Governments will also have to facilitate the participation of institutional investors . 
The challenge of long-term investment cannot be resolved without attracting more diverse and private sources of finance . 
In 2013 , institutional investors in OECD countries alone held more than $ 57 trillion in assets , and pension funds collected around $ 1 trillion in new contributions . 
Tools that could be used to leverage institutional investments include public-private partnerships to develop clear and transparent project pipelines for major green infrastructure projects , green banks and green bonds , and instruments that mitigate risk and enhance the availability of credit . 
Regulations for international accounting and funding will have to be examined to identify policies that inadvertently discourage institutional investors from putting their resources into longer-term , illiquid assets . 
Finally , public equity markets will have to be strengthened . 
Savings must be channeled to firms that need capital for innovation and sustainable job creation . 
Today , however , the quality of corporate-governance frameworks worldwide is challenged by the growing complexity of investment chains and the dominance of passive and short-term investment strategies . 
In a globally interdependent world , a better financial and investment system cannot be achieved on a country-by-country basis . 
There may be no one-size-fits-all model for economic development , but , without global standards and complementary regulations , the long-term outlook for the world economy will remain bleak .
