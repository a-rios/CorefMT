The Danger of Weak States 
NEW YORK : Fateful events in Israel and Yugoslavia have obscured ongoing turmoil in Nigeria and Indonesia . 
Yet ethnic and religious conflict in both &quot; megastates &quot; is consuming many lives . 
We must not lose sight of the cataclysmic consequences that could result if such violence is not curbed . 
The problem is that both countries , hobbled by legacies of tyranny and degradation , are in danger of losing the capacity to curtail violence . 
The history of the struggle for rights from the Magna Carta to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been mainly about placing limits on state authority . 
So it may seem anomalous to argue that , if rights are to be protected , what is required today in various parts of the world is reinforcement of centralized governmental power . 
Liberal values , however , are threatened as thoroughly by state incapacity as by despotic power . 
All over the world , including two of its largest countries , the implications of this truth loom menacingly . 
The consequences for Nigeria &apos;s 114 million people , for the rest of the troubled continent of Africa and for the international system would be catastrophic if Nigeria disintegrated . 
And though the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo is the most democratic and the least corrupt Nigeria has known since independence ( including a period in the late 1970s when General Obasanjo was the country &apos;s military ruler until he stepped aside voluntarily to permit election of a civilian president ) , the country remains dangerously weak . 
President Obasanjo &apos;s administration has failed to prevent Islamic fundamentalists from imposing sharia law in several Northern states , triggering violence that has cost thousands of lives . 
Nor has it brought peace to the oil rich Niger delta whose impoverished people resent exploitation of the resources of their territory for the enrichment of a corrupt elite . 
Most recently , violence in Lagos between Hausas and Yorubas has cost hundreds of lives . 
Multiethnic , multilingual , multireligious Nigeria is now in greater danger of fragmentation than at any time since the genocidal war in Biafra a generation ago . 
Indonesia , another large , ethnically and - to a lesser extent - religiously diverse state many thousands of miles away , faces comparable difficulties . 
There , too , a committed democrat , Abdurrahman Wahid ( Gus Dur ) , has become President after an extended period of corrupt and brutal military rule . 
As in Nigeria , however , the central government seems to lack the power to halt communal violence that has killed thousands . 
If President Wahid &apos;s government cannot stop the carnage , Indonesia , too , could break apart . 
These crises of governmental incapacity have arisen , in both Nigeria and Indonesia , at moments of great promise . 
These are states with vast riches . 
Given the opportunity to govern honestly and peacefully for a few years , the administrations of Presidents Obasanjo and Wahid could make vast improvements in the lives of ordinary Nigerians and Indonesians . 
They may not get that chance , however , because the governments they head lack the power to curb ethnic and religious conflict . 
The powerlessness of Presidents Obasanjo and Wahid is based in part on the unreliability of their armed forces . 
The military regimes that preceded them derived their strength from their soldiers . 
But armed might is of little use to democratic governments attempting to protect the rights of citizens if they must fear that their troops will commit abuses that foster separatist tendencies . 
That is the situation that confronts President Wahid who knows that much of the popular support for independence movements in Aceh and Irian Jaya derives from resentment against military violations of human rights , and that intervention by the army in the Maluka &apos;s at very least exacerbated the conflict between Christians and Muslims who had long lived together peaceably and may even have provoked the violence . 
Perhaps an even more important factor in the weakness of these newly democratic governments is declining public identification with the state . 
Decades of misrule and deprivation deepened religious and ethnic divisions . 
It takes a state of great vitality , Machiavelli pointed out in &quot; The Discourses &quot; half a millennium ago , to survive not only changes in the membership of a government , but changes in the basic form of government . 
The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia , indeed , disintegrated at the point when they were making changes in their form of government . 
Because misrule sapped vitality from Nigeria and Indonesia , the same could happen to them during their transition to democratic government . 
If these new democracies are to survive , their governments will require generous assistance from the international community , including debt relief . 
Knowing the amount of wealth stolen and squandered by Obasanjo &apos;s predecessors , such as General Sani Abacha , and by the Suharto kleptocracy in Indonesia , pleas for such relief may not be welcomed easily . 
Yet Western leaders must recognize that if these states fall apart , their debts will never be paid and , inevitably , creditor countries will face vast additional costs . 
So giving democrats such as Obasanjo and Wahid a chance to hold their countries together could stave off immense suffering and may also be a matter of self-interest . 
For anyone concerned with human rights , disintegration in Nigeria or Indonesia would be a calamity . 
Though it is impossible to predict how events may unfold , there are precedents in the many conflicts triggered by the breakdowns of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia . 
The violence that has already taken place in Nigeria and Indonesia makes one fear that if these states cannot be held together - and here , new creative types of thinking and approaches to advocacy may be called for on the part of the human rights community - the results could be far bloodier than anything we have yet seen .
