Can Russia Be Great ? 
CAMBRIDGE - In the 1950 &quot; s , many Americans feared that the Soviet Union would surpass the United States as the world &apos;s leading power . 
The Soviet Union had the world &apos;s largest territory , the third largest population , and the second largest economy , and it produced more oil and gas than Saudi Arabia . 
Moreover , the USSR possessed nearly half of the world &apos;s nuclear weapons , had more men under arms than the US , and had the most people employed in research and development . 
It detonated a hydrogen bomb in 1952 , only one year after the US , and it was the first to launch a satellite into space , in 1957 . 
In terms of soft power , communist ideology was attractive in post-World War II Europe , owing to its anti-fascist credentials , and in the Third World because of its identification with popular national-independence movements . 
Soviet propaganda actively fostered a myth of the inevitability of communism &apos;s triumph . 
Nikita Khrushchev famously boasted in 1959 that the Soviet Union would overtake the US by 1970 , and by 1980 at the latest . 
As late as 1976 , Leonid Brezhnev told the French president that communism would dominate the world by 1995 . 
Such predictions were bolstered by reportedannual economic growth rates of 5-6 % and an increase in the USSR &apos;s share of global output , from 11 % to 12.3 % , between 1950 and 1970 . 
After that , however , the Soviet growth rate and share of global output began a long decline . 
In 1986 , Mikhail Gorbachev described the Soviet economy as &quot; very disordered . 
We lag in all indices . &quot; 
A year later , Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told his officials , &quot; You and I represent a great country that in the last 15 years has been more and more losing its position as one of the leading industrially developed nations . &quot; 
What is surprising in retrospect is how wildly inaccurate Western assessments of Soviet power were . 
In the late 1970 &quot; s , a &quot; Committee on the Present Danger &quot; argued that Soviet power was surpassing that of the US , and the 1980 American election reflected such fears . 
Yet in 1991 , the Soviet Union collapsed . 
The end of the Soviet Union left Russia significantly shrunken territorially ( 76 % of the USSR ) , demographically ( 50 % of the USSR &apos;s population ) , economically ( 45 % of the USSR &apos;s output ) , and in terms of military personnel ( 33 % of the USSR &apos;s armed forces ) . 
Moreover , the soft power of communist ideology had virtually disappeared . 
Nonetheless , Russia had nearly 5,000 deployed nuclear weapons , and more than one million armed forces , though its total military expenditure was only 4 % of the world total ( compared to 40 % for the US ) , and its ability to project power globally had greatly diminished . 
In economic resources , Russia &apos;s $ 2.3 trillion GDP was 14 % that of the US at independence , and its $ 16,000 per capita income ( measured in terms of purchasing power parity ) was roughly 33 % that of the US . 
Its economy was heavily dependent on revenue from oil and gas , with high-tech goods representing only 7 % of its manufactured exports ( compared to 28 % for the US ) . 
In terms of soft power , despite the attractiveness of traditional Russian culture , Russia has little global presence . 
In the words of Russian analyst Sergei Karaganov , Russia has to use &quot; hard power , including military force , because it lives in a much more dangerous world and has no one to hide behind from it , and because it has little soft power - that is , social , cultural , political , and economic attractiveness . &quot; 
Russia is no longer hampered by communist ideology and a cumbersome central-planning system , and the likelihood of ethnic fragmentation , though still a threat , has waned . 
Whereas ethnic Russians comprised only 50 % of the Soviet Union &apos;s population , they now make up 81 % of the Russian Federation . 
The political institutions needed for an effective market economy are largely missing , and corruption is rampant . 
Russia &apos;s robber-baron capitalism lacks the kind of effective regulation that creates trust in market relationships . 
The public-health system is in disarray , mortality rates have increased , and birthrates are declining . 
The average Russian male dies at 59 - extraordinarily low for an advanced economy . 
Estimates by United Nations demographers suggest that Russia &apos;s population may decline from 145 million today to 121 million by mid-century . 
Many Russian futures are possible . 
At one extreme , some view Russia as an industrialized banana republic whose corrupt institutions and insurmountable demographic and health problems make decline inevitable . 
Others argue that reform and modernization will enable Russia to surmount its problems , and that its leadership is headed in this direction . 
Late in 2009 , President Dmitri Medvedev issued a sweeping call for Russia to modernize its economy , wean itself from a humiliating dependence on natural resources , and do away with Soviet-style attitudes that he said were hindering its effort to remain a world power . 
But , as Katinka Barysch of the Centre for European Reform argues , Russian leaders &quot; concept of modernization is overly statist , particularly given that public institutions function so badly . 
&quot; An innovative economy needs open markets , venture capital , free thinking entrepreneurs , fast bankruptcy courts and solid protection of intellectual property , &quot; she argues . 
Instead there are &quot; wide-spread monopolies , ubiquitous corruption , stifling state interferences , weak and contradictory laws . &quot; 
Dysfunctional government and pervasive corruption make modernization difficult . 
Peter Aven , president of Alfa Bank , argues that , &quot; economically , it looks like the Soviet Union more and more . 
There is a huge dependency on oil , a need for capital , a need for serious reforms , while the social burden is very strong . 
Stagnation is the main threat . &quot; 
A Russian economist says flatly that , &quot; there is no consensus in favor of modernization . &quot; 
Whatever the outcome , because of its residual nuclear strength , its great human capital , its skills in cyber-technology , and its location in both Europe and Asia , Russia will have the resources to cause major problems for or to make major contributions to a globalized world . 
We all have an interest in Russian reform .
