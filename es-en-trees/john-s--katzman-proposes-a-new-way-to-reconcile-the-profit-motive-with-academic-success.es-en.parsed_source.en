The Underachieving Education Business 
NEW YORK - Capitalism has produced many high-quality products and services , from smartphones to high-speed transport and compelling entertainment . 
Yet the profit motive , essential in so many fields , seems to have disappointed in one crucial area : education . 
In the United States , for-profit universities have a six-year graduation rate of 22 % , far below the 60 % achieved by not-for-profit institutions . 
The former spend 23 % of their revenue on recruiting new students , compared with a mere 1 % spent by non-profit institutions . 
At the primary and secondary levels , charter schools ( publicly funded independent schools ) run by for-profit companies are 20 % less likely than non-profit institutions to meet proficiency standards , with some of the weakest results coming from the largest for-profit institutions . 
Even companies that provide textbooks , educational software , management systems , and student loans fail to achieve the level of excellence reached in other sectors . 
For-profit education is not just a US phenomenon ; it is part of a global trend . 
New for-profit universities are appearing wherever demand for higher education is strong . 
In developing Asia and Latin America , scores of new classroom and online English-language preparation programs are trying to meet demand , though it may be too early to judge their quality . 
As the founder of several for-profit education companies and an adviser to many others , I have watched managers and investors ( including my own ) succumb to the temptation to place financial targets above academic goals . 
This should not be surprising - educational results take years to measure , but profits and bonuses for executives are calculated annually . 
I would like to believe that strong financial performance and educational excellence are not mutually exclusive . 
After all , for-profits can hire high-quality staff , respond nimbly to changing conditions , and raise the capital required to scale up quickly . 
American Public University System and Renaissance Learning , for example , have demonstrated that one can &quot; do well by doing good . &quot; 
One of my own companies brought together the capital , technology , and people needed to enable students worldwide to access America &apos;s leading graduate programs online . 
Unfortunately , such projects are exceptions . 
The education sector must find a better balance between quality and financial returns . 
Fourteen US states have started to do that by authorizing so-called benefit corporations ( or B Corps ) - businesses that promise to consider more than shareholder value in their strategic decisions . 
Though B Corps are expected to act in the public interest , they cannot be forced to do so ; if they look beyond the bottom line , they do so voluntarily . 
One solution might be to create a variant of the B Corp - call it the E Corp - that could transform the for-profit education sector . 
An education company could attain E Corp status only if it became transparent about its values and outcomes . 
For example , E-Corp-owned colleges might be required to provide prospective students with the graduation rate , average student-debt levels , and the average starting salaries of students with similar academic records and educational goals . 
Furthermore , E-Corp colleges might be required to reveal their per student instructional , marketing , and executive-compensation costs , as well as their pre-tax profits . 
Critics might counter that no one should care how much profit a company earns , so long as it provides a worthwhile service . 
Perhaps , but why not share the data and see how many students enroll in a school when they fully understand their odds of success and how their money will be used ? 
E Corps should also analyze and publish their results ( including disappointing ones ) , as this would motivate schools to improve service . 
Not all education can be free , but information about education should be . 
Many companies might embrace such reforms simply to serve students better . 
But we should not underestimate the leverage of public spending . 
As confidence in the E-Corp metrics rises , we could make E-Corp status a condition for participating in government programs . 
In the US , that would include such coveted funding as Title I grants for primary and secondary education , and Title IV subsidized student loans for higher education . 
After all , why should companies benefit from taxpayer support if they are unwilling to put accountability and educational excellence at least on the same level as their targets for return on investment ? 
Even the most mission-driven companies can be tempted to trade educational quality for outsize commercial returns . 
An E-Corp designation would ensure that education leaders can continue to focus on the bottom line , but still rise to the top of the class .
