Lula \ u0027s Baptism of Fire 
With his stunning victory in Sunday &apos;s second round of Brazil &apos;s presidential elections , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ( &quot; Lula &quot; ) has finally achieved his goal after four attempts . 
Written off at the campaign &apos;s start as an eternal loser , Lula confounded his critics by running a professional campaign garnering support from across the political spectrum . 
Here he was helped by the lackluster efforts of his main opponent , José Serra , who failed to build on the substantial achievements of outgoing President Fernando Henrique Cardoso . 
In a country stained by social injustice and the most unequal distribution of income in the world , Lula &apos;s victory is an astounding achievement in view of his humble origins and trade union background . 
Governing , however , will not be easier than winning office . 
Lula &apos;s Workers &apos; Party ( PT ) is in the minority in both houses of congress . 
His natural allies elsewhere on the left cannot provide a majority . 
The PT , however , is both the largest party in the lower house and the most disciplined . 
That discipline matters because governing Brazil has always been about building coalitions . 
Lula will face a similar situation to that which confronted President Cardoso , whose Social Democratic Party ( PSDB ) managed over the course of eight years to push through legislation on the basis of party coalitions that looked highly unstable to outsiders . 
His control of his party should help him reach the necessary compromises he will need to make with other parties in order to govern effectively . 
More troubling for Lula is Brazil &apos;s economic condition . 
Hit hard by the US recession , sluggish growth in Europe , Argentina &apos;s collapse , low commodity prices , and protectionist barriers against farm products , steel and textiles , Brazil &apos;s economy will do well to grow 2 % this year . 
Unemployment is rising and inflows of foreign direct investment have fallen . 
Although Brazil is running a large trade surplus , this has more to do with cutbacks in imports than export growth . 
But the darkest shadow is the threat of a default on the country &apos;s $ 260 billion debt . 
Despite prudent fiscal policies and a primary surplus target ( i.e. before interest payments ) of 3.75 % , Brazil &apos;s debt has continued to grow and for several months has been difficult - if not impossible - to refinance . 
Brazilian debt now trades at half its face value , which implies a high probability of default . 
Furthermore , the 40 % decline in the exchange rate this year and recent increases in the overnight ( SELIC ) interest rate to 21 % aggravate the situation , because much of the debt is either linked to the currency or to the SELIC rate . 
For once , the IMF cannot be accused of inaction . 
To avoid contagion from Argentina &apos;s financial crisis , the IMF agreed a $ 30 billion package with Brazil in August designed to stabilize markets and avoid the need for the Central Bank to exhaust Brazil &apos;s reserves defending the currency . 
Much of this money still needs to be disbursed . 
So far it has failed to achieve its purpose and Brazil is remains poised on a knife-edge . 
What can Lula do ? 
He only takes office in the New Year , but the markets will be watching to see how he responds before then . 
The choice of his economic team is crucial , because he plans to replace the respected finance minister , Pedro Malan , and the governor of the Central Bank , Arminio Fraga . 
Giving more independence to the Central Bank would be well received in the markets , as otherwise they will fear Lula will succumb to the temptation to inflate the country &apos;s way out of difficulties . 
The acid test will come from Lula &apos;s approach to fiscal policy . 
If his administration increases the fiscal surplus through expenditure cuts or new taxes , this may reassure international capital markets . 
Such actions , however , fly in the face of everything Lula has always stood for and what his supporters demand . 
They may form the least bad option if he does not want Brazil to go the way of Argentina . 
Argentina &apos;s collapse ( its GDP will drop by around 12 % this year ) is a terrible warning of what can happen if Lula takes a wrong step . 
In Brazil &apos;s case there is a further reason for avoiding default : the country &apos;s debt is owed mainly to Brazilians so that the losers in any default would not only be foreign creditors , but Brazilian banks , insurance companies and other financial institutions , putting the entire financial system at risk of collapse . 
Whatever happens to the debt , Brazil &apos;s democracy won big in this election . 
At a time when voter apathy and corruption are commonplace across Latin America , Brazilians demonstrated that politics can be relevant and exciting . 
Moreover , Lula &apos;s margin of victory suggests that the Brazil &apos;s elite has become reconciled to the idea of a left-wing president , even if foreign investors remain troubled . 
If Lula survives his economic baptism of fire , he will soon need to turn attention to the controversial issue of hemispheric integration . 
Armed with Trade Promotion Authority ( TPA ) , the Bush administration is keen to push ahead with the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) . 
Lula is sceptical that the FTAA can serve Brazil &apos;s interests and would prefer to boost MERCOSUL , the customs union linking Brazil with its neighbours . 
But contagion from Argentina &apos;s crisis has undermined MERCOSUL and Argentina &apos;s commitment to the regional project cannot be assured after next year &apos;s presidential elections in that country . 
Balancing regional and hemispheric integration will likely be the second harsh test President Lula will face .
