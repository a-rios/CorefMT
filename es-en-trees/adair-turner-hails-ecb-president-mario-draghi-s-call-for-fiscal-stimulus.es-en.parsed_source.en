Facing Reality in the Eurozone 
LONDON - European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s recent speech at the annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , has excited great interest , but the implication of his remarks is even more startling than many initially recognized . 
If a eurozone breakup is to be avoided , escaping from continued recession will require increased fiscal deficits financed with ECB money . 
The only question is how openly that reality will be admitted . 
The latest economic data have forced eurozone policymakers to face the severe deflationary risks that have been apparent for at least two years . 
Inflation is stuck far below the ECB &apos;s 2 % annual target , and GDP growth has ground to a halt . 
Without strong policy action , the eurozone , like Japan since the 1990s , faces a lost decade or two of painfully slow growth . 
Until last month , growing concern provoked unconvincing policy proposals . 
Jens Weidmann provided the novel spectacle of a Bundesbank president calling for higher wages . 
But wage growth will not occur without policy stimulus . 
Draghi sought to talk down the euro exchange rate to improve competitiveness . 
But Japan and China also want competitive exchange rates to spur export growth , and the eurozone already runs a current-account surplus . 
The German model of export-led growth cannot work for the eurozone as a whole . 
Structural reform is certainly needed in some countries to increase long-term growth potential ; but the impact of structural reform on short-term growth is often negative . 
The eurozone needs higher domestic demand to escape the debt overhang left behind by pre-crisis excess . 
In countries such as Spain and Ireland , private debts grew to unsustainable levels . 
In others , such as Greece and Italy , public debt also was too high . 
Household consumption , business investment , and public expenditure have all been cut in an attempt to pay down debt . 
But simultaneous public and private deleveraging is bound to depress demand and growth . 
Faced with private deleveraging in the 1990s , Japan avoided an even deeper depression only by running large public deficits . 
That is why eurozone fiscal austerity has become self-defeating . 
The more aggressively the Italian government , for example , cuts expenditure or increases taxation , the more its public-debt burden - already above 130 % of GDP - will likely grow to unsustainable levels . 
Until two weeks ago , eurozone policymakers denied this reality . 
On August 22 , at Jackson Hole , Draghi admitted it . 
Without higher aggregate demand , he argued , structural reform could be ineffective ; and higher demand requires fiscal stimulus alongside expansionary monetary policy . 
The Italian economists Francesco Giavazzi and Guido Tabellini have spelled out what coordinated fiscal and monetary policy could mean . 
They propose tax cuts equal to 5 % of GDP for 3-4 years in all eurozone countries , financed by very long-term public debt , all of which the ECB should buy . 
They argue that ECB quantitative easing alone , with no fiscal relaxation , would be ineffective . 
Giavazzi and Tabellini &apos;s proposals may entail too large a stimulus . 
But they also highlight a crucial question : How does quantitative easing stimulate an economy ? 
The Bank of England has presented QE as a purely monetary policy tool that sustains economic growth in the face of necessary and desirable fiscal consolidation . 
It works , the BoE has argued , by reducing medium-term interest rates , increasing asset prices , and inducing shifts in investor preferences that indirectly stimulate investment and thus demand . 
The US Federal Reserve &apos;s position has been more ambiguous . 
Fed Vice-Chairman Stanley Fischer , like former Chairman Ben Bernanke , has stressed that premature fiscal consolidation can hold back post-crisis recovery . 
Thus , the Fed has implicitly viewed QE in part as a tool to ensure that rising bond yields do not offset the beneficial impact of large deficits . 
The Fed &apos;s position is more persuasive . 
Fiscal stimulus has a direct and powerful impact on demand . 
In Milton Friedman &apos;s words , it enters directly into &quot; the current income stream . &quot; 
Monetary stimulus alone is less direct , takes longer , and risks causing adverse side effects . 
Continued low interest rates allow unsuccessful companies to struggle on , slowing productivity growth ; asset-price rises exacerbate inequality ; and monetary stimulus works only by reigniting the private credit growth that generated the debt overhang in the first place . 
But if fiscal stimulus must be facilitated by central bank bond purchases to prevent yield increases and to assuage fears about debt sustainability , doesn &apos;t that amount to monetary financing of fiscal deficits ? 
The answer depends on whether the purchases prove permanent . 
In Japan , where the central bank now owns government bonds worth 35 % of GDP ( a level that is rising fast ) , they undoubtedly will . 
There is no credible scenario in which Japan can generate fiscal surpluses large enough to repay its accumulated debt : a significant proportion will remain permanently on the Bank of Japan &apos;s balance sheet . 
Likewise , if Giavazzi and Tabellini &apos;s proposal were adopted , the result would almost certainly be some permanent increase in the ECB &apos;s balance sheet . 
Should we admit that possibility explicitly in advance ? 
The argument in favor is that failure to do so would raise fears about how increased public debt would ever be repaid , or about how the ECB would &quot; exit &quot; from a swollen balance sheet , in turn undermining the stimulative impact of fiscal and monetary coordination . 
The argument against is moral hazard : If we admit that modest ECB-financed deficits are possible and appropriate now , what will prevent politicians and electorates from demanding large and inflationary ECB-financed deficits on other occasions ? 
The political risks are certainly great . 
Optimal policy may therefore require a non-transparent fudge ; monetary and fiscal &quot; coordination &quot; might mean , after the fact , permanent monetary finance , but without ever openly admitting that possibility . 
But , fudge or not , Draghi has moved the debate forward dramatically . 
Without a greater role for fiscal policy , the eurozone will face either continued slow growth or an eventual breakup .
