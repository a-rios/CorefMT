WikiLeaks &quot; Flawed Answer to a Flawed World 
NEW YORK - Long ago , I wrote about the Internet pioneer Julf Helsingius , who ran a precursor to WikiLeaks called anon.penet.fi. 
As I said then : &quot; Anonymity in itself should not be illegal . 
There are enough good reasons for people to be anonymous that it should be &#91; allowed &#93; - at least in some places on the Net ( as in real life ) . &quot; 
But anon.penet.fi got little notice : there weren &apos;t enough people on the Internet at the time to read what was posted , and Julf did not use the WikiLeaks &quot; business model &quot; of cooperation with &quot; establishment media . &quot; 
Eventually , he had to shut down the site in a tussle with the Church of Scientology , which used copyright law to keep its secrets . 
There can be no clear line marking what needs to be kept secret ( or never uttered ) from what does not , but it should be drawn far from where most authorities put it - at least in a world where authorities are imperfect . 
If we are unwilling or unable to demand transparency from the institutions that have power over us , we should be grateful for those who put their lives ( and their consciences ) at risk to do so . 
So I was eager to meet WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the 2009 Personal Democracy Forum in Barcelona . 
At that time , Assange was just gaining visibility outside the tech community . 
He was opaque and playfully cryptic , already a little paranoid - perhaps justifiably so . 
More recently , it appears that he ruled his little organization with no tolerance for dissent . 
That makes him a jerk , and presumably we will soon find out whether he is also a rapist according to Swedish law . 
But you probably need to be a bit weird and callous to devote your life to transparency for others . 
Mikhail Khodorkovsky , the imprisoned ex-CEO of what was Russia &apos;s largest oil company , is another example of a flawed , uncompromising person who challenged the flawed people in power and their unaccountability . 
Such people do not die for our sins ; rather , they sin on our behalf , so that we may live comfortably while they afflict the authorities at great personal risk and in disregard of ( authorities &apos; interpretation of ) the law and sometimes even ethics . 
Assange &apos;s motives , as far as I know , are not anti-American , but anti-authority . 
He would argue , I believe , that he has no power other than to authenticate and publish documents that others send to him about people with power , and thus that he has no obligation to reveal anything about himself . 
This is and should be the principle behind WikiLeaks and its successors - to publish information that officials would keep secret , not information about private lives . 
In a world where governments , corporations , and other institutions have so much information about us , it is only right that we should have more information about them and about the activities of people acting on their behalf . 
If institutions are not fully accountable , it is useful to have an unaccountable countervailing institution to reveal their secrets . 
In fact , the WikiLeaks model is fairly sensible : it solicits documents from anyone , assesses whether they are real , and posts them with alerts to the establishment press , which operates as de facto gatekeeper to the masses . 
After all , how many people actually visit the WikiLeaks originals ? 
Few , compared to the millions who see them interpreted in the mass media . 
What about the possibility of endangering lives ? 
What about real secrets about terrorists and delicate negotiations ? 
By all accounts , that point has not been reached . 
If it is , I would support throttling WikiLeaks &quot; revelations ... and most media would not republish its content . 
The irony is that little has been revealed that we didn &apos;t know already . 
What we &apos;re getting is the details - the personal comments , the texture of diplomats &quot; lives and those of the people they watch , the horrible toll of war and its daily indignities , the hypocrisies and lies of those in power . 
Will all this make us more cynical rather than more demanding ? 
Will it make governments more opaque rather than more transparent ? 
Are we headed for an era of more paranoia about secrets , including less sharing of useful information ? 
If the cure is to be worse than the disease , to quote Personal Democracy Forum co-founder Andrew Rasiej , let &apos;s find a better cure : let &apos;s make the proper distinction between what should be secret and what everyone knows . 
Let &apos;s foster more transparency about the institutions that have power over us so that a WikiLeaks is no longer necessary or justifiable . 
So far , little damage has been done - and little positive change accomplished . 
The US reaction has been over the top . 
It called on Amazon to cancel its contract with WikiLeaks , while PayPal shut off WikiLeaks &quot; account - apparently without even being asked . 
Why is it that the call for transparency seems to apply only to countries that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits , rather than to the one that she represents ? 
I recently talked with an establishment stalwart who told me how much more difficult these leaks will make it for the US diplomatic corps to accomplish its putatively worthy goals . 
But is diplomatic convenience really so important ? 
Perhaps it &apos;s useful for us all to understand how things actually work . 
In any case , the official reaction is overkill . 
In the long run , WikiLeaks matters for two reasons . 
The first is that we need a better balance of power between people and power . 
Information - and specifically the Internet &apos;s power to spread it - is our best defense against bad , unaccountable behavior . 
Second , we do want to trust our governments and institutions . 
The point of openness is to make those in power behave better - and to make us trust them more . 
Rather than viewing them as enemies , we should know what they are up to , and perhaps have a little more say in what they do . 
Making that happen requires someone willing to face opprobrium , jail , and a life of surveillance . 
I wish Julian Assange were a better person , but better people are not rising to the challenge .
