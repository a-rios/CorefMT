The Lessons of Liberia 
At the United Nations last week , US Secretary of State Colin Powell and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stood together to urge swift and substantial financial support for Liberia , which is poised on a knife &apos;s edge between the possibility of recovery and a new descent into violence . 
The response was gratifying , with the European Union fully backing the effort to rebuild that shattered nation . 
Nearly a hundred countries participated in the meeting , promising Liberia more than $ 500 million in reconstruction aid . 
Many observers saw this display of unanimity as a conspicuous contrast to the deep divisions in the world community that surrounded the war in Iraq . 
But in many ways it is Iraq that was anomalous . 
The international consensus about the urgent need to pacify and rebuild Liberia - with UN leadership guided by a united Security Council - is in line with global responses to peace accords in many other national and regional conflicts , from East Timor , Cambodia , and Mozambique to Liberia &apos;s neighbors Sierra Leone and Cote d &apos;Ivoire . 
But despite global agreement on the need to seize these moments , we too often find ourselves scrambling after the fact , in ad hoc fashion , to convene willing donors and organize teams of experts and logisticians to deliver urgently needed aid . 
Even in the best of cases , as we have seen with Liberia , where a peace accord was signed in August , this takes a perilously long time . 
Before the next Liberia comes along , we the world needs to find a way to provide resources for peacemaking much , much sooner . 
As we look at the wider global context , it is clear that this kind of post-conflict intervention is going to be a major part of the UN &apos;s work in coming years . 
We cannot always afford to wait for gatherings of world leaders and financial pledges from donor nations . 
In Liberia &apos;s capital city of Monrovia last month , young men began to riot because full funding was not yet in place for the UN &apos;s disarmament program . 
Having come to turn in weapons for a fee , some of them became violent when they discovered that the money wasn &apos;t there to pay them . 
If ex-combatants are not provided with alternative civilian opportunities - and quickly - many will simply pick up their guns again . 
The critical importance of economic support in these ephemeral post-conflict moments has been underscored by both the successes and failures seen elsewhere in Africa , and around the world . 
As I stressed in remarks to the Security Council last week , the UN cannot respond quickly and substantially if people and money are not standing by , ready to go . 
Effective peace-building cannot wait for slow fundraising . 
Conflicts are overwhelmingly likely to re-ignite in the first year of peace . 
To prevent new downward spirals of violence , our intervention needs to be swift , smart , and on a sufficient scale to turn the tide towards a sustainable peace . 
International organizations like the UN must have at their disposal beforehand enough financial and human resources to go beyond the tokenism that too often characterizes the international response to post-conflict societies . 
More is needed than a handful of combatants reintegrated , a school or two re-built , and an under-funded young government lauded abroad but unable to deliver jobs or law and order to its war-scarred people at home . 
Liberia and Iraq both demonstrate the need for this kind of freestanding capacity , as 21st century geopolitics is likely to continue to be more preoccupied with nation-building intervention in the aftermath of conflict than with wars between states . 
The conference in New York Friday drew on the collective resources and expertise of UN agencies , the World Bank , and the major donor countries led by the United States , an impressive and effective collaboration that offers a rough framework for preparation for future post-conflict response . 
Having money available in advance , on standby for the inevitable , would be sound global policy . 
Until that money is available , the UN and its many multilateral partners will remain collectively unprepared to aid these post-conflict societies at their moment of greatest political opportunity and economic need . 
We will all ultimately pay dearly , in human and financial terms , if we fail to ensure that these peace processes lead to long-term stability for societies that have already suffered far too much , for their immediate neighbors , and for the world at large .
