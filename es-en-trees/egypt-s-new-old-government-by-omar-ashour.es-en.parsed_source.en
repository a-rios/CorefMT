Egypt &apos;s New Old Government 
CAIRO - Egypt &apos;s first-ever freely elected president , the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s Mohamed Morsi , has appointed his first cabinet , and guess what ? 
It is crammed with officials from the old regime . 
Morsi &apos;s government clearly reflects the balance of power between the president and the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ( SCAF ) . 
But it also reflects the strategy of the Muslim Brothers to shift that balance . 
Thirty-five ministers were chosen by the new prime minister , Hisham Qandil , seven of whom ( including Qandil ) were ministers in the previous SCAF-appointed government . 
Five ministries - information , higher education , youth , labor , and housing - were given to the Muslim Brothers &quot; Freedom and Justice Party ( FJP ) . 
Other pro-revolution figures secured several cabinet portfolios as well : education , legal and parliamentary affairs , industry and foreign trade , and most importantly , the justice ministry . 
The &quot; power &quot; ministries - interior and defense - were kept under the control of figures associated with the former regime . 
Field Marshal ( and SCAF leader ) Hussein Tantawy retained his post as Defense Minister , and General Ahmed Gamal al-Din was appointed to head the interior ministry , whose brutal behavior sparked the revolution . 
Gamal al-Din &apos;s uncle , Abd al-Ahad Gamal al-Din , was the ruling National Democratic Party &apos;s parliamentary majority leader during the 2000 &quot; s . 
His nephew was a hardliner during negotiations to release political prisoners , as well as during talks to end the street clashes of November 2011 . 
He was also a witness in the &quot; Giza Officers Trial , &quot; in which 17 policemen were accused of killing and injuring protesters in January 2011 . 
He defended the policemen , claiming that the victims had been killed in &quot; self-defense . &quot; 
Nonetheless , Ashraf al-Banna , a co-founder of the reformist General Coalition for Police Officers ( GCPO ) , remains hopeful : &quot; He was an effective deputy &#91; minister of interior &#93; ... &#91; so &#93; we expect some reforms . 
The situation in the ministry is unsustainable . &quot; 
But others , like the members of the more revolutionary Officers but Honorable Coalition , accuse Gamal al-Din of being a member of a powerful anti-reform faction in the ministry , dubbed &quot; al-Adly &apos;s men &quot; ( after former Interior Minister Habib al-Adly ) . 
As for the pro-change forces , Minister of Information Salah Abd al-Maqsud , a leading figure in the Muslim Brothers &quot; media wing , will control a sector that continues to attack the group and Morsi , even after his electoral victory . 
The new youth minister , Osama Yassin , another leading Muslim Brother , was the de facto &quot; security chief &quot; in Tahrir Square during the 18 days that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak . 
He belongs to the so-called &quot; iron organization , &quot; a strong , committed faction led by Khairat al-Shater , the Brotherhood &apos;s first deputy chairman ( deputy general guide ) . 
Likewise , higher education went to Mostafa Mossad , an FJP member who was in charge of the education portfolio during Morsi &apos;s campaign . 
The labor ministry went to Khaled al-Azhary , a Brother who was deputy head of the Workers Union and a victim of police brutality in 2010 . 
For the Brothers , of course , everything could change if the government is dissolved after the upcoming parliamentary election . 
But , even if that happens , the experience , data , and knowledge gained will be of immense value to the Brotherhood . 
Four other ministries went to pro-revolution and Islamist figures . 
Mohamed Mahsoob , a leading figure in the moderate Islamist al-Wasat Party who campaigned against the return of Mubarak-era officials , became Minister of Legal and Parliamentary Affairs . 
Hatem Saleh , the deputy chairman of the Civilization Party , which joined the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s electoral coalition in the last parliamentary election , was named Minister of Industry and Foreign Trade . 
The religious endowment ministry , which influences the country &apos;s main Islamic institution , al-Azhar , went to another of the Brothers &quot; allies , Talaat Afifi , the deputy head of the Islamic Legal Body for Rights and Reform , which comprises more than a hundred of Egypt &apos;s leading Islamist scholars and activists . 
Finally , Ahmed Mekki , the former deputy head of the Court of Cassation , Egypt &apos;s highest appeals court , will lead the justice ministry , which is in need of real change . 
Mekki is a strong proponent of judicial independence , and was dubbed &quot; the revolution &apos;s representative &quot; in Qandil &apos;s government . 
Overall , only ten of the 35 ministries went to pro-change forces , with the other ministers a combination of old-regime figures and technocrats without any publicly declared political affiliation . 
But the choice of the ten ministries was strategically clever , given the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s coming battles with SCAF . 
All of these ministries represent low-cost , soft power : official institutions that can enhance pro-change forces &quot; capacity to mobilize , give them religious legitimacy , and remove the threat of judicial repression as they strengthen unofficial networks on the ground . 
But the SCAF side is applying a similar strategy : strengthening its hold over the key power ministries . 
For example , in last week &apos;s annual personnel changes at the interior ministry , many of those expected to be removed , owing to accusations of corruption , complicity in repression , or both , were not . 
A few were even promoted . 
The struggle for Egypt thus continues . 
The &quot; Second Republic &quot; is yet to be born .
