China &apos;s New Reforms in Theory and Practice 
HONG KONG - On November 12 , the Third Plenary of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) announced a major turn to market-oriented policies : interest-rate and currency liberalization , reform of banks and state enterprises , clearer land ownership for rural inhabitants , and a better deal for urban migrants . 
Behind this landmark decision was a potential crisis . 
China &apos;s success has been driven by cheap exports based on cheap labor , infrastructure built by state enterprises with low-cost bank funding , and government budgets funded by land sales . 
But labor is no longer cheap , road construction to connect major cities has given way to building large shopping malls in small towns , and land sales based on rezoning are reaching both economic limits and the limits of villagers &quot; tolerance . 
Cheap money with limited investment outlets now risks fueling property bubbles and industrial overcapacity . 
Without fundamental change , China faces slower economic growth , inadequate job creation and innovation , and popping bubbles . 
The solution is a rapid shift from China &apos;s export-based growth model to one based on domestic demand ; from infrastructure to consumption ; from the dominance of large state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) to that of small and medium-size private enterprises ; from industry to services ; and , more broadly , from bureaucratic control to market control . 
All successful Asian countries have made this shift ; 
South Korea and Taiwan are models . 
But rapid change entails immense pain . 
SOEs will lose their low-interest loans , subsidized land , monopoly protection , and privileged housing . 
Party and state bureaucracies will lose power ( and income ) . 
Local governments are particularly desperate . 
They have huge debts , which they amortize by rezoning and selling land . 
Already squeezed by exorbitant property prices and popular resistance to land takings , they now face higher interest rates , property taxes , villagers empowered by stronger rights , and expensive new requirements to provide social services to migrants . 
The desperation of local potentates and SOE executives has created powerful resistance to reform . 
At a plenary reportedly marked by acrimony , China &apos;s political leaders sided with reform . 
As one economic planner said , when asked about resistance before the decisive meeting , &quot; In the end , all of our leaders understand numbers . 
The implications of the numbers are clear . &quot; 
The Third Plenum &apos;s announcement of its decisions took the form of a statement of broad principles , leaving many observers concerned by the lack of detail . 
But the CCP &apos;s role is to set the direction of policy ; executing the Party &apos;s decisions is the government &apos;s job . 
And the Plenum did establish a top-level group to coordinate and enforce implementation of its decisions . 
While implementation will be a long struggle , with occasionally fierce resistance , key reforms are already underway . 
The current 12th Five-Year Plan calls for annual wage increases to average at least 13.4 % ; this year , wages are rising at an average rate of 18 % , which will squeeze out industries characterized by obsolescence or overcapacity . 
Moreover , the government &apos;s anti-corruption campaign is targeting some of the most powerful industry groups , such as the petroleum faction , thereby weakening their resistance to reform . 
Most important , economic outcomes are becoming increasingly aligned with the authorities &quot; goals . 
Services already account for more output and employment than industry - the Internet company Alibaba , for example , is empowering both consumers and smaller companies on a previously unimaginable scale - and recent growth has been driven by domestic demand rather than net exports . 
Reform is not just a plan ; it is already happening . 
Economic openings to Central Asia and to ASEAN ( specifically to Vietnam ) are well underway , and reform will include further international opening . 
The Third Plenum &apos;s decisions follow the launch in September of the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone , which will open new sectors to foreign investment and permit largely market-based financial transactions and capital flows . 
The liberalization of capital flows is intended to be a gradual national policy , channeled through trusted institutions in Shanghai . 
For trade in goods , the new free-trade zone is intended to compete directly with Singapore and Hong Kong . 
China fears dependence on those entrep√¥ts in the event of conflict . 
For foreign investors , the policy will be to expand greatly the range of opportunities while curtailing foreign control ; foreign companies , for example , may hold minority stakes in the telecoms sector , while dominant foreign companies like Monsanto will face constraints . 
President Xi Jinping faces the politically risky task of pushing the CCP &apos;s reform agenda against fierce opposition while the economy slows . 
By emphasizing Party control - through a crackdown on SOEs , government opponents , and critics in the media and academia - Xi seeks to maximize his ability to impose economic reforms while minimizing the risk of a challenge from conservative forces . 
Above all , he is determined to avoid the fate of previous Chinese leaders like Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang , who lost their jobs after a critical mass of their opponents came to believe that economic and political reform jeopardized Party control . 
So , at least for now , China will focus on another great wave of economic reform , whereas political reform will mostly be limited to reorganization of government agencies to boost efficiency and strengthen efforts to reduce corruption . 
( There have been some steps toward reform , including a decision to remove judges from local political control . ) 
And yet China will find it increasingly difficult to postpone stronger measures that would appease popular demands for fairness , including the establishment of an independent judiciary , which could prove to be no less an imperative than structural economic reforms . 
Likewise , the leaders must either accept much of the information revolution &apos;s swamping of controls or engage in far more costly repression . 
Hopes for political reform rest on the possibility that Xi &apos;s second term will see the accession to top leadership of reformers like Politburo member Wang Yang and Vice President Li Yuanchao . 
For now , however , China will focus on another great wave of economic reform .
