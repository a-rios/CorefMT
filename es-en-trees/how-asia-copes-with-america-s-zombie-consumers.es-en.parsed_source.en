How Asia Copes with America &apos;s Zombie Consumers 
NEW HAVEN - Asia needs a new consumer . 
A post-crisis generation of &quot; zombie consumers &quot; in the United States is likely to hobble growth in global consumption for years to come . 
And that means that export-led developing Asia now has no choice but to turn inward and rely on its own 3.5 billion consumers . 
Of course , this is not the first time that Asia has had to cope with the walking economic dead . 
Japan &apos;s corporate zombies were at the epicenter of its first &quot; lost decade &quot; in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Sclerotic companies were put on life-support credit lines by their zaibatsu - like banking partners - delaying their inevitable failure and perpetuating inefficiencies and disincentives that resulted in a post-bubble collapse in Japanese productivity growth . 
Similarly , the crisis of 2008-2009 led to zombie-creating bailouts in the West . 
From Wall Street to AIG to Detroit , the US was quick to rescue corporate giants that would have failed otherwise . 
Britain and Europe did the same , throwing lifelines to RBS , HBOS-Lloyds , Fortis , Hypo Real Estate , and others . 
In the West , the excuse was &quot; too big to fail . &quot; 
How different is that from Japan &apos;s mindset nearly 20 years ago ? 
But the most prominent zombie may well be a broad cross-section of American consumers who are still suffering from the ravages of the Great Recession . 
Afflicted by historically high unemployment , massive under-employment , and relatively stagnant real wages , while burdened with underwater mortgages , excessive debt , and subpar saving , US consumers are stretched as never before . 
Yet the US government has tried virtually everything to prevent consumers from adjusting . 
Going well beyond the requisite extension of unemployment-insurance benefits , the safety net has been expanded to include home-foreclosure containment programs , other forms of debt forgiveness , and extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus . 
Compassion is part of the moral fabric of any society . 
But a fine line separates it from the &quot; creative destruction &quot; that is essential to purge a post-crisis system of its excesses . 
Japan crossed that line in the 1990 &quot; s , as its corporate zombies prevented the painful but necessary adjustments in its post-bubble economy . 
That could happen in the US if Washington continues to favor policies that condone the reckless excesses of the recent past and inhibit the deleveraging and balance-sheet repair that America &apos;s zombie consumers now need for post-crisis healing . 
Notwithstanding government life-support initiatives , US consumers seem headed for years of retrenchment . 
Consumption &apos;s share of US GDP currently stands at a sharply elevated 70 % . 
While that &apos;s down from the high of 71.3 % in early 2009 , it remains fully four percentage points above the 66 % norm that prevailed in the final quarter of the twentieth century . 
Reversion to that earlier share is likely as American consumers make the transition from the insanity of the boom to the sanity required of the bust . 
That spells subdued growth in US consumption for years to come - with a predictably massive impact on global consumption . 
While the US accounts for only 4.5 % of the world &apos;s population , its consumers spend $ 10.3 trillion annually - by far the most in the world . 
So , with US consumption growth likely to be restrained , who will take America &apos;s place ? 
Europe ? 
Japan ? 
I wouldn &apos;t bet on either . 
That &apos;s where Asia fits into the equation . 
As an export-led region , Asia remains heavily dependent on end-market demand from consumers in the developed world . 
The export share of developing Asia &apos;s 12 largest economies rose from 35 % of pan-regional output in the late 1990 &quot; s to 45 % in early 2007 . 
Little wonder that every economy in the region either fell into recession or experienced sharp slowdowns when global trade plunged in late 2008 . 
Decoupling was not an option . 
Nor should Asia draw a false sense of security from all the hype currently being accorded to the hopes and dreams of a so-called &quot; two-speed world . &quot; 
Heavily dependent on Western markets , Asia must seek support from a new source of demand . 
It should start by looking in the mirror . 
For developing Asia as a whole , internal private consumption currently stands at a record low of just 45 % of GDP - down ten percentage points from the 55 % share prevailing as recently as 2002 . 
It &apos;s not as if Asian consumer demand is dormant . 
In a post-crisis world - impaired by America &apos;s zombie consumers - export-led Asia is in serious need of a pro-consumption rebalancing . 
Nowhere is that more evident than in China . 
With private consumption having fallen to a record low of 35 % of GDP in 2008 ( fully ten percentage points below the Asian norm ) , China faces major rebalancing imperatives - all the more urgent if post-crisis consumption growth in the West remains weak . 
The good news is that China appears to have arrived at a similar conclusion . 
Its 12th Five-Year Plan is focused on three major pro-consumption initiatives : jobs ( especially labor-intensive services ) ; wages ( underscored by accelerated urbanization ) ; and a reduction of fear-driven precautionary saving ( arising out of a broadening of the social safety net ) . 
If China delivers on each of these three fronts - as I suspect it will - private consumption &apos;s share of Chinese GDP could rise by as much as five percentage points between now and 2015 . 
That would be good news for East Asia &apos;s other economies - namely , Japan , Korea , and Taiwan . 
With relatively small populations - and a declining one in the case of Japan - these countries have no choice but to rely on exports and external demand to drive economic growth . 
In all three cases , China has replaced the US as their major export market . 
That shift came just in the nick of time . 
If China is successful in implementing its pro-consumption agenda , the rest of Asia will be well positioned to avoid the fallout from America &apos;s new generation of zombie consumers . 
How the United States copes is a different matter altogether .
