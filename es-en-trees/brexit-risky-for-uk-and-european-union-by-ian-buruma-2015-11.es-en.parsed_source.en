The Brexit Balance Sheet 
BRUSSELS - Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s offer to British citizens to hold a referendum on whether to leave the European Union might have seemed like a reasonably safe gamble just a few years ago . 
Most people then probably would have voted to stay . 
That was before the Greek crisis created havoc in the eurozone , and the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees caused the EU ( although not the United Kingdom ) to lose control of some of its borders . 
Cameron might actually get other European leaders to agree to his demands for reform , without which he has said he would not campaign to keep his country in the EU . 
They are not extreme : a guarantee that non-eurozone members gain full access to the single market ; less red tape at the EU level ; a British exemption from &quot; ever-closer union . &quot; 
His last demand - fewer benefits for EU migrants - will be the hardest for EU leaders to accept . 
Despite this reform push , some British Euroskeptics have criticized Cameron for being too soft . 
The temptation in Britain simply to abandon what appears to be a sinking ship and go it gloriously alone is growing stronger . 
This is understandable . 
The question is whether &quot; Brexit &quot; would be as glorious as its proponents like to imagine . 
Unleashed from the rule of Brussels , the sirens of Brexit promise , Britain would once again be a beacon of freedom in the world , respected by China , tied to the United States in the bilateral &quot; special relationship , &quot; and all the while retaining friendly commercial ties with the European continent . 
Business would boom , the City of London would prosper , and Britons never would be slaves , not of the EU or anyone else . 
In fact , things might not work out so well . 
As Cameron himself stated after a recent visit to Iceland , the Norwegian option of engaging in free trade with the EU as a non-member is far from ideal . 
Norway , like Switzerland , still has to abide by EU single-market rules , without having any say in formulating them . 
Norway also pays large amounts of money to the EU budget , and must accept free movement of people ( including refugees ) across its borders . 
As far as the US is concerned , President Barack Obama has already said that he would take Britain more seriously inside the EU than outside it . 
Similarly , US Trade Representative Michael Froman recently observed that the US would not be interested in negotiating a separate free-trade deal with Britain . 
All this , by the way , assumes that post-Brexit Britain would still be Britain . 
The Scots would almost certainly want to break away from England and rejoin the EU as an independent member , giving further encouragement ( as if that were needed ) to separatists in Catalonia and other frustrated European regions . 
England would be left to wave its flag of St. George over Wales and Northern Ireland , a rather sour prospect . 
But there are more potential supporters of Brexit : some keen European Unionists who have found the UK &apos;s often-obstructive membership increasingly annoying . 
Good riddance , they might say , once the divorce finally comes through ; now the true Europeans can finally unite in peace . 
This , too , strikes me as misguided . 
A Brexit would most likely be as damaging to the EU as it would be to Britain itself . 
Contrary to popular perception , the EU is not ruled by the European Commission in Brussels . 
National governments still make the most important decisions in the European Council , where leaders wheel and deal to advance their countries &quot; interests . 
Germany , Britain , and France , as the EU &apos;s three major powers , form a crucial balance . 
Without Britain , the EU becomes a Franco-German enterprise , with Germany very much the dominant partner , and all the smaller member states squeezed between the two . 
This is not really what anybody wants , not even the Germans , who are reluctant hegemons . 
Moreover , Britain and Germany are natural allies in balancing the statist tendencies of France . 
Britain has in fact had a largely positive impact on the EU . 
Europe has benefited from Britain &apos;s democratic traditions , its openness to the rest of the world , its impatience with bureaucratic obstruction , and even its skepticism toward abstract utopian schemes . 
If any city feels like a European capital now , it is not Brussels , Berlin , or even Paris , but London , home to almost a half-million French citizens , as well as millions of other foreigners . 
There is one more reason , however , why Brexit would be a disaster for Europe . 
It is generally agreed that European countries cannot cope alone with the major problems of our time , such as climate change , immigration , the challenges of a globalized economy , and , above all , security . 
Since 1945 , Pax Americana has papered over Europe &apos;s incapacity to manage its own security . 
Europeans like to talk about the values of peace and compromise , while US military might takes care of their safety . 
This has created a degree of dependency that should be redressed , if only to relieve the Americans of their burden and give Europe the political influence to match its economic clout . 
For this to be achieved , the EU must establish a common security policy and military force . 
This will be a long and difficult process . 
Germany , for obvious reasons , will not take the lead . 
Only France and Britain have enough military strength to provide a sound basis for European defense . 
Britain could , in this vital matter , be the savior of Europe . 
Without it , there is no hope . 
Alas , Cameron is singularly ill equipped to make such a positive argument . 
He leads a party that is increasingly opposed to any European project apart from trade . 
And he would have to battle a folk memory that has lasted several generations : the last time Britain helped to save Europe , it stood very much , and very proudly , alone .
