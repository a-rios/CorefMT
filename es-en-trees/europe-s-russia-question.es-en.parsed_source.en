Europe &apos;s Russia Question 
BRUSSELS - Friend or foe , or something uneasily in-between ? 
That &apos;s the question Europe is asking about Russia , and Russia about a newly aggressive Europe . 
President Vladimir Putin &apos;s choice of Dmitri Medvedev , Chairman of Gazprom , the gas company with an emerging stranglehold on European energy supplies , only throws this question into an even starker light . 
Relations between Europe and Russia have been deteriorating for several years , but once manageable economic issues , including energy , are now being aggravated by much more volatile political differences . 
The risk is a climate of undisguised hostility , with potentially greater costs than during the nadir of the Cold War . 
The most obvious and imminent flashpoint is Kosovo . 
The likelihood is that early next year most of the European Union &apos;s member nations will recognize the Albanian-majority enclave on Serbia &apos;s southern edge as an independent state . 
This is certain to enflame not just Serbia , but also the Kremlin . 
Then there are rising tensions over plans by the United States to based a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic , as well as the growing likelihood that further NATO enlargement will include Georgia , the increasingly prosperous neighbor with which Russia has fractious relations . 
Russia continues to fan secessionist flames there by encouraging the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia . 
Tempers are rising in both Russia and Europe , yet , paradoxically , when it comes to the major challenges they face , their interests are largely identical . 
Both are threatened by Islamic extremism and growing unrest . 
Both have much to lose if the Middle East erupts into fresh violence . 
And both face serious demographic problems , given shrinking and aging populations , as well as the challenge of Asia &apos;s rising superpowers . 
The breakdown in relations has been gradual and undramatic - more a morose and resentful refusal to see each other &apos;s point of view than a succession of rows . 
This owes much to the humiliations that Russia suffered when the end of communism forced its economy to its knees , and to Western short-sightedness about Russia &apos;s fundamental strengths and resilience . 
The EU is as much to blame as the Kremlin . 
In the years since the collapse of the Soviet Union , neither EU nor European national policymakers have devised a coherent strategy setting out the relationship that Europe wants with the Russian Federation . 
Today , it is more important than ever that the EU , which now includes not only former Soviet satellites but countries that were part of the USSR , should create a strategic policy framework . 
This reflects not only worries about energy and shared security concerns , but also the need to head off any looming crisis in the Middle East that could plunge large parts of the world into turmoil , if not armed conflict . 
There , and in the volatile Caucasus , a significant improvement in Europe &apos;s relations with Russia is crucial to defusing tensions . 
For its part , Europe needs to mount a charm offensive to persuade Putin and Medvedev that Russia &apos;s real interest is in improving bilateral relations . 
In the Middle East , it needs to persuade Iran to hold in check the military elements of the nuclear program that Russia has made possible . 
None of this will be easy , not only because Europe &apos;s relationship with Russia has grown so chilly , but also because Putin is understood to despise the EU as politically impotent . 
Russian leaders may have misinterpreted as a sign of weakness Europe &apos;s representation at last month &apos;s EU-Russia summit by two Portuguese politicians - European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and Prime Minister Jose Socrates , whose government currently holds the revolving EU presidency . 
Most telling in Russian eyes has been EU countries &quot; competition for oil and gas contracts , which has done much to convince the Kremlin that Europe is not a political force to be reckoned with . 
On the European side , engineering a new spirit of d√©tente will be tough . 
There is widespread disapproval of Putin &apos;s autocratic style and of his government &apos;s human rights record . 
Extending an olive branch to Russia will have little or no voter appeal in most EU countries , and Putin &apos;s efforts to retain power de facto if not de jure after Medvedev wins his likely victory next March are certain to make matters worse . 
The question , therefore , is whether Europe and Russia can establish a new framework for talking to one another . 
There are plenty of well-worn diplomatic paths , so it &apos;s not structures that are lacking . 
What &apos;s needed is a more positive frame of mind , and specific ideas about what to do .
