The Full Value of Childhood Vaccines 
GENEVA - If you want to know the value of vaccines , just spend some time in a clinic in Africa . 
The faces of the mothers and fathers say it all : vaccines prevent illness and save lives . 
But what these parents probably do not realize is that the story does not end there . 
As they leave the clinic and head home , they have already taken steps to improve not just their child &apos;s health , but also his or her educational prospects and long-term future . 
What &apos;s more , they will have also helped to improve their own lives and enhance the economic prospects of their wider community . The reasons are simple . 
We know that children who are healthier do not require medical treatment or care , both of which cost time and money . 
So , by avoiding illness , infants have a greater chance of growing into healthier children who are able to attend school and become more productive members of society . 
Meanwhile , instead of caring for a sick child , parents can work , thereby increasing their ability to earn . 
So , rather than spending money on medical bills , they are boosting their income and spending capacity , both of which help the economy to grow . 
All of this intuitively makes sense , and there is a growing body of scientific evidence to back it up . 
It has been shown , for example , that vaccinated children not only do better at school , but also that , through the prevention of damage that can be caused by infectious diseases and resulting nutritional imbalances , they appear to benefit in terms of cognitive development . 
Similarly , vaccination has been shown to lead to wage gains across populations , while improvements in child survival rates are associated with lower fertility rates . 
What all of this means is that by measuring the effectiveness of vaccines merely in terms of &quot; lives saved , &quot; we could be seriously underestimating the full extent of the benefits that they offer . 
As things stand , in terms of the cost effectiveness of health interventions , vaccines are already considered one of public policy &apos;s &quot; best buys . &quot; 
Indeed , it has been calculated that the work being done to expand vaccine coverage in developing countries by my organization , the GAVI Alliance , should yield an 18 % return on investment by 2020 . 
Given the progress made in expanding vaccination programs in recent years , this revelation represents a unique opportunity for the global community , particularly as we begin to close the lid on polio . 
With poliovirus now endemic in just three remaining countries , we are already beginning to use the momentum that has carried eradication efforts so far to broaden the scope of routine immunization to reach more of the poorest children . 
Now the same health systems and strong immunization services can act as a platform to help fight poverty , too . 
But , with current estimates indicating that , by 2030 , only half the world &apos;s children will be fully immunized with the 11 vaccines recommended globally by the World Health Organization , we clearly still have some way to go . 
For our part , we are helping to change that . 
Since it was formed in 2000 , GAVI has already helped to immunize more than 370 million children against a range of deadly diseases . 
As a result , we have prevented 5.5 million deaths , and we aim to immunize a further 245 million children and save five million more lives by 2015 . 
At the same time , we now know that the value of vaccines extends far beyond the number of lives saved . 
Investment in vaccines is not about short-term savings , either in terms of lives or economic costs ; it is about providing children with lifetime protection and the ability to realize their full potential . 
So , while reducing mortality is already reason enough to want to immunize every child on the planet , now we have the added motivation that we are not just saving lives , but also helping to improve many more lives in the process .
