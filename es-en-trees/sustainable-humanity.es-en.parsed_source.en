Sustainable Humanity 
ADDIS ABABA - Sustainable development means achieving economic growth that is widely shared and that protects the earth &apos;s vital resources . 
Our current global economy , however , is not sustainable , with more than one billion people left behind by economic progress and the earth &apos;s environment suffering terrible damage from human activity . 
Sustainable development requires mobilizing new technologies that are guided by shared social values . 
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has rightly declared sustainable development to be at the top of the global agenda . 
We have entered a dangerous period in which a huge and growing population , combined with rapid economic growth , now threatens to have a catastrophic impact on the earth &apos;s climate , biodiversity , and fresh-water supplies . 
Scientists call this new period the Anthropocene - in which human beings have become the main causes of the earth &apos;s physical and biological changes . 
The Secretary-General &apos;s Global Sustainability Panel has issued a new report that outlines a framework for sustainable development . 
The GSP rightly notes that sustainable development has three pillars : ending extreme poverty ; ensuring that prosperity is shared by all , including women , youth , and minorities ; and protecting the natural environment . 
These can be termed the economic , social , and environmental pillars of sustainable development , or , more simply , the &quot; triple bottom line &quot; of sustainable development . 
The GSP has called for world leaders to adopt a new set of Sustainable Development Goals , or SDGs , that will help to shape global policies and actions after the 2015 target date for achieving the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) . 
Whereas the MDGs focus on reducing extreme poverty , the SDGs will focus on all three pillars of sustainable development : ending extreme poverty , sharing the benefits of economic development for all of society , and protecting the Earth . 
It is , of course , one thing to set SDGs and quite another to achieve them . 
The problem can be seen by looking at one key challenge : climate change . 
Today , there are seven billion people on the planet , and each one , on average , is responsible for the release each year of a bit more than four tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . 
This CO2 is emitted when we burn coal , oil , and gas to produce electricity , drive our cars , or heat our homes . 
All told , humans emit roughly 30 billion tons of CO2 per year into the atmosphere , enough to change the climate sharply within a few decades . 
By 2050 , there will most likely be more than nine billion people . 
If these people are richer than people today ( and therefore using more energy per person ) , total emissions worldwide could double or even triple . 
This is the great dilemma : we need to emit less CO2 , but we are on a global path to emit much more . 
We should care about that scenario , because remaining on a path of rising global emissions is almost certain to cause havoc and suffering for billions of people as they are hit by a torrent of droughts , heat waves , hurricanes , and more . 
So , how can the world &apos;s people - especially its poor people - benefit from more electricity and more access to modern transportation , but in a way that saves the planet rather than destroys it ? 
The truth is that we can &apos;t - unless we improve dramatically the technologies that we use . 
We need to use energy far more wisely while shifting from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources . 
Such decisive improvements are certainly possible and economically realistic . 
Consider the energy inefficiency of an automobile , for example . 
We currently move around 1,000 to 2,000 kilograms of machinery to transport only one or just a few people , each weighing perhaps 75 kilograms ( 165 lbs . ) . 
And we do so using an internal combustion engine that utilizes only a small part of the energy released by burning the gasoline . 
Most of the energy is lost as waste heat . 
We could therefore achieve huge reductions in CO2 emissions by converting to small , lightweight , battery-powered vehicles running on highly efficient electric motors and charged by a low-carbon energy source such as solar power . 
Even better , by shifting to electric vehicles , we would be able to use cutting-edge information technology to make them smart - even smart enough to drive themselves using advanced data-processing and positioning systems . 
The benefits of information and communications technologies can be found in every area of human activity : better farming using GPS and micro-dosing of fertilizers ; precision manufacturing ; buildings that know how to economize on energy use ; and , of course , the transformative , distance-erasing power of the Internet . 
Mobile broadband is already connecting even the most distant villages in rural Africa and India , thereby cutting down significantly on the need for travel . 
Banking is now done by phone , and so , too , is a growing range of medical diagnostics . 
Electronic books are beamed directly to handheld devices , without the need for bookshops , travel , and the pulp and paper of physical books . 
Education is increasingly online as well , and will soon enable students everywhere to receive first-rate instruction at almost a zero &quot; marginal &quot; cost for enrolling another student . 
Yet getting from here to sustainable development will not just be a matter of technology . 
It will also be a matter of market incentives , government regulations , and public support for research and development . 
But , even more fundamental than policies and governance will be the challenge of values . 
We must understand our shared fate , and embrace sustainable development as a common commitment to decency for all human beings , today and in the future .
