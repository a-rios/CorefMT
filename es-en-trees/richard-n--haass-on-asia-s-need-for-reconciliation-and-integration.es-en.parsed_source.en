Which Asian Century ? 
NEW YORK - It has become something of a clich√© to predict that Asia will dominate the twenty-first century . 
It is a safe prediction , given that Asia is already home to nearly 60 % of the world &apos;s population and accounts for roughly 25 % of global economic output . 
Asia is also the region where many of this century &apos;s most influential countries - including China , India , Japan , Russia , South Korea , Indonesia , and the United States - interact . 
But to point to Asia &apos;s growing importance says nothing about its character . 
There can be two , very different Asian centuries , and the one that emerges will have profound consequences for the region &apos;s peoples and governments - and for the world . 
One future is an Asia that is relatively familiar : a region whose economies continue to enjoy robust levels of growth and manage to avoid conflict with one another . 
The second future could hardly be more different : an Asia of increased tensions , rising military budgets , and slower economic growth . 
Such tensions could spill over and impede trade , tourism , and investment , especially if incidents occur between rival air or naval forces operating in close proximity over or around disputed waters and territories . 
Cyberspace is another domain in which competition could get out of hand . 
The question is this : Will twenty-first-century Asia resemble Europe - the dominant region of much of modern history - during the first half of the twentieth century , when it experienced two wars of unprecedented cost and destruction , or the second half , when tensions with the Soviet Union were effectively managed and Western Europe experienced unprecedented peace and prosperity ? 
The reference to Europe is instructive , because Europe did not just get lucky . 
History unfolded as it did only because its political leaders demonstrated great vision and discipline . 
As a result , long-term adversaries like France and Germany were reconciled within a region-wide project - first a coal and steel community , which expanded to become the European Economic Community and , ultimately , the European Union - that integrated the continent politically and economically to such an extent that violent conflict was rendered unthinkable . 
All of this is worth considering , because few parallels are to be found in contemporary Asia . 
On the contrary , the region is notable for a lack of meaningful regional agreements and institutions , particularly in the political-military and security spheres . 
Moreover , a marked lack of reconciliation and settlement of long-standing disputes makes it all too easy to imagine not only a military incident involving two or more neighbors , but also the possibility that such an incident leads to something larger . 
Many of these disputes date back to World War II , or even before . 
Korea and China harbor strong anti-Japanese sentiment . 
There is no Russia-Japan peace treaty , and the two countries have competing claims over the Kuril Islands ( known as the Northern Territories to the Japanese ) . 
The border between China and India is also a matter of contention . 
In fact , the regional security climate has worsened in recent years . 
One reason is the continued division of the Korean Peninsula and the threat that a nuclear-armed North Korea poses to its own people and its neighbors . 
China has added to regional tensions with a foreign policy - including advancing territorial claims in the East and South China Seas - that would be described diplomatically as &quot; assertive , &quot; and more bluntly as &quot; bullying . &quot; 
Meanwhile , Japan appears determined to extricate itself from many of the military constraints imposed on it ( and , until recently , embraced by the vast majority of Japanese ) as a result of its aggressive behavior in the 1930 &quot; s and 1940 &quot; s . 
These developments both reflect and reinforce heightened nationalism throughout the region . 
What is needed is more intense bilateral diplomacy among Asian governments to settle long-standing disputes . 
From there , regional pacts that promote free trade and contend with climate change should be negotiated . 
Finally , a regional forum should be established to regulate better the deployment of military force , including confidence-building measures to reduce the risk of incidents and to help manage them if they occur . 
Some of what is needed can be modeled on what Europe has achieved . 
But Europe is relevant for another reason : Europeans have succeeded in maintaining stability and building great prosperity for the last seven decades in no small part because of the American presence and role . 
The United States , an Atlantic power , was fully integrated into the region &apos;s economic and security arrangements . 
Something along these lines is likely to be no less critical for Asia , where the US , which is also a Pacific power , has vital interests and deep commitments . 
America &apos;s strategic &quot; pivot &quot; to Asia thus needs to be substantial and lasting . 
This will require that successive US administrations emphasize free trade , increase America &apos;s air and naval presence , and invest in diplomacy designed to promote China &apos;s integration within the region on terms consistent with the interests of the US , its allies ( Japan , South Korea , the Philippines , and Australia ) , and its many friends . 
The alternative is an Asia left to its own devices - and an Asian century that is dominated by China or characterized by frequent bouts of diplomatic tension or even conflict . 
Few in Asia or beyond would benefit from such a future .
