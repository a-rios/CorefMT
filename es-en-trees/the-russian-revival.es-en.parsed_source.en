The Russian Revival 
Russia &apos;s national revival and new assertiveness under President Vladimir Putin is not really home made but reflects highly auspicious international conditions . 
Oil and gas prices are sky high , the United States is overwhelmed by serious problems in Iraq and the Middle East , and the West is divided about how it should deal with Russia . 
Putin &apos;s administration has been keen to take advantage of this favorable environment . 
Yet , although some of the Kremlin &apos;s moves seem clear and reasonable , others can scarcely be described as rational or forward-looking . 
For example , Russia &apos;s desire to take ownership stakes in Europe &apos;s gas distribution markets makes perfect sense and is fully legitimate given Russia &apos;s energy assets and pipeline capacity . 
Likewise , Russia &apos;s effort to expand its influence in the energy-rich countries of Central Asia is aimed at consolidating Russia &apos;s stature as a major energy supplier . 
Asserting itself as a major power outside the Western realm , Russia has boosted the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , which includes China and most Central Asian countries . 
Indeed , Russia is increasingly attaching ever greater significance to its relations with China , something of a strategic shift in foreign policy , even if it is not yet clear how close Russia wants to be get to China . 
But bullying Georgia and Moldova , demonstrating support for Hamas , or indulging North Korea do not seem to be guided by any strategic sense of Russia &apos;s far-reaching interests . 
They seem guided by pure and simple spite . 
Russia &apos;s heavy-handed pressure on Georgia and its support of secessionist movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia , two unrecognized republics within Georgia , inflames passions and risks destabilizing the already tense Northern Caucasus . 
Should instability ignite into open warfare , Russia will find it impossible to avoid the consequences . 
Of course , Georgia &apos;s President Mikhail Saakashvili may at times be thoughtless and arrogant . 
Because Russia claims the status of a world power , it is expected to show restraint and responsibility . 
But the urge to project strength for the mere sake of doing so now seems overwhelming for the Kremlin . 
This urge stems from a desire to make up for the years of Russia &apos;s humiliation after the USSR collapsed , years when the West contemptuously disregarded Russia &apos;s views and interests . 
This lingering resentment may explain Putin &apos;s somewhat uncivil behavior and dubious jokes when dealing with his Western counterparts . 
It may also have been behind Russia &apos;s irrational decision to renege on its promise to give Poland the files that document the massacre of thousands of Polish officers on Stalin &apos;s orders in the forest at Katyn at the outbreak of WWII . 
What possible benefits can Russia gain by breaking this pledge ? 
The motive seems to be brutally simple : &quot; Precisely because you want it , we won &apos;t deliver . 
We can do what we like because we &apos;re strong again . &quot; 
But this renewed vigor is too fresh for Russia to feel truly confident . 
Putin &apos;s irresistible urge to remind everyone that Russia has recovered its strength suggests underlying insecurity . 
In an episode recently reported by The New York Times , at one of Putin &apos;s informal meetings with Bush , Putin showed the US president his Labrador and said , &quot; Bigger , tougher , stronger , faster , meaner than Barney &quot; ( Bush &apos;s dog ) . 
Though Putin barely implied that the dog &apos;s superiority indicates Russia &apos;s domination over the US , his remark appears to be in line with his general message : don &apos;t you ever dare to doubt our high status . 
Russia is by no means seeking to isolate itself . 
Russia needs America and the West in order to realize its ambitious initiative to establish international centers of uranium enrichment , and it needs Western markets , which are the largest consumers of Russia &apos;s gas and oil . 
Moreover , it is in the West where the rich and powerful Russian elite likes to travel , go shopping , and send their kids to school . 
But Russia &apos;s muscle-flexing behavior leaves Western leaders perplexed and wary , which seems a dubious way for the Kremlin to secure Russia &apos;s new stature . 
Contentious foreign policy makes contacts uneasy and agreements difficult to reach . 
It damages the trust needed for stronger trade relations . 
As Russia &apos;s conflict with Ukraine in early January over gas prices demonstrated , when Russia plays rough , the West grows apprehensive and suspicious rather than more amenable . 
What will happen should crude strength and hard language prove inadequate to the task of insuring Russian national interests ? 
No one can say , but Russia &apos;s history in this regard is not a source of hope .
