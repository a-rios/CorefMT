Alternative Fiscal Medicine ? 
BRUSSELS - Forget the fiscal cliff . 
The real issue is the fiscal mountain . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , the challenge of reducing the public debt / GDP ratio to a safe level is daunting for most advanced countries . 
In Europe , many governments , having embarked on the path of fiscal consolidation while their economies were still weak , are now struggling with the growth consequences . 
As a result , debt stabilization seems to be an increasingly elusive target . 
In the US , consolidation has barely begun . 
Because the private economy is now stronger , it may benefit from more auspicious growth conditions , but the magnitude of the fiscal retrenchment needed - more than ten percentage points of GDP , according to the IMF - is frightening . 
In Japan , nothing has been done thus far and the size of the required effort defies imagination . 
All advanced-country governments are still officially committed to undergoing the pain of adjustment . 
Willingly or not , some may seek recourse to inflation or administrative measures aimed at trapping domestic savings into financing the state and keeping bond rates low ( what economists call financial repression ) - or , eventually , to outright debt restructuring . 
All three unorthodox remedies have been used in past debt crises . 
They can be regarded as alternative forms of taxation , albeit implicit rather than explicit . 
In the end , they are different methods of forcing current and future generations to shoulder the burden of accumulated debt . 
Is it preferable to adjust in full ? 
Or is it advisable to blend consolidation with a dose of alternative medicine ? 
Here , the discussion is often couched in moral terms . 
Adjustment , we are told , is morally commendable , whereas the alternatives all amount to repudiating the contracts that governments entered into with bondholders . 
This may be true , but governments are political animals . 
They care more about voters &quot; welfare than about moral principles . 
So it is worth discussing in purely economic terms what orthodox and unorthodox choices imply from the standpoints of equity and efficiency . 
Start with equity . 
From this perspective , adjustment is hard to beat . 
Combining taxation and spending cuts allows the burden of adjustment to be distributed precisely . 
The decision belongs to the legislator . 
Some adjustments , like in France nowadays , weigh mostly on high-income , high-wealth individuals ; others , like in Italy , weigh on pensioners . 
These choices were made democratically , in parliaments , as part of budget decisions . 
The unorthodox techniques , however , are less nimble and more opaque . 
Inflation affects those with assets ( cash , bonds ) or incomes ( wages , income from saving accounts ) that are not indexed ( or are under-indexed ) to prices . 
Financial repression is basically a form of administrative taxation of domestic savings . 
On distributional grounds , there does not seem to be a good reason to resort to them in lieu of relying on outright taxation . 
There are exceptions , though . 
First , governments and parliaments may be politically unable to take responsibility for distributional choices and prefer to keep them hidden . 
This is not a good reason , but it does happen . 
Second , restructuring concentrates the burden on those holding bonds issued before a certain cut-off date . 
It thus draws a line between the past and the future - leading to what John Maynard Keynes called &quot; euthanasia of the rentier . &quot; 
When the burden of past turpitude is too heavy , there may be no other way to protect future generations . 
Finally , both inflation and restructuring put some of the burden on non-resident bondholders ( through exchange-rate depreciation and the direct reduction of the value of assets , respectively ) . 
For taxpayers , this is a tempting formula , especially when a large share of the debt is held externally . 
To make foreigners pay is , however , disputable . 
After all , they were not the beneficiaries of the public goods or transfers financed by the issuance of debt . 
So it should be reserved for cases when the country as a whole has grown insolvent . 
Turn now to efficiency . 
Large-scale adjustments may leave an economy with a weaker capacity to generate growth , because high taxes have deterred investment or cuts in public spending have eroded the quality of infrastructure and education . 
Financial repression distorts choices by channeling savings to budget financing and away from investment . 
Inflation implies higher long-term interest rates until markets regain confidence in the central bank . 
Indeed , restructuring undermines the foundation of the entire financial system : the safe-asset role of sovereign debt . 
As developing countries have learned from experience , all these effects are bad for capital allocation and growth . 
But an exception can again be made : When both the private and public sectors are overburdened with debt , adjustment leads to a debt-deflation spiral , particularly when conducted under a fixed exchange-rate regime . 
In such conditions , full adjustment risks becoming self-defeating , or at least unreasonably painful , as illustrated by the Greek case . 
Despite their economic costs , restructuring public debt or eroding all public and private liabilities through inflation can be less detrimental options . 
In the end , the alternatives to adjustment are not soft . 
Barring extreme situations , they generally underperform fiscal adjustment from the standpoint of equity , and are no better in terms of efficiency . 
So the idea that they offer an easy way out of advanced countries &quot; current predicament is a fantasy . 
Rather than flirting with illusions , governments should confront the hard choices ahead of them . 
Relying on alternative remedies is sometimes necessary , but they are not painless . 
They should be considered treatments of last resort .
