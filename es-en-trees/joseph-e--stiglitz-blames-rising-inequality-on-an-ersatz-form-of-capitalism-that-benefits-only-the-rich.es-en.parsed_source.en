Democracy in the Twenty-First Century 
NEW YORK - The reception in the United States , and in other advanced economies , of Thomas Piketty &apos;s recent book Capital in the Twenty-First Century attests to growing concern about rising inequality . 
His book lends further weight to the already overwhelming body of evidence concerning the soaring share of income and wealth at the very top . 
Piketty &apos;s book , moreover , provides a different perspective on the 30 or so years that followed the Great Depression and World War II , viewing this period as a historical anomaly , perhaps caused by the unusual social cohesion that cataclysmic events can stimulate . 
In that era of rapid economic growth , prosperity was widely shared , with all groups advancing , but with those at the bottom seeing larger percentage gains . 
Piketty also sheds new light on the &quot; reforms &quot; sold by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s as growth enhancers from which all would benefit . 
Their reforms were followed by slower growth and heightened global instability , and what growth did occur benefited mostly those at the top . 
But Piketty &apos;s work raises fundamental issues concerning both economic theory and the future of capitalism . 
He documents large increases in the wealth / output ratio . 
In standard theory , such increases would be associated with a fall in the return to capital and an increase in wages . 
But today the return to capital does not seem to have diminished , though wages have . 
The most obvious explanation is that the increase in measured wealth does not correspond to an increase in productive capital - and the data seem consistent with this interpretation . 
Much of the increase in wealth stemmed from an increase in the value of real estate . 
Before the 2008 financial crisis , a real-estate bubble was evident in many countries ; even now , there may not have been a full &quot; correction . &quot; 
The rise in value also can represent competition among the rich for &quot; positional &quot; goods - a house on the beach or an apartment on New York City &apos;s Fifth Avenue . 
Sometimes an increase in measured financial wealth corresponds to little more than a shift from &quot; unmeasured &quot; wealth to measured wealth - shifts that can actually reflect deterioration in overall economic performance . 
If monopoly power increases , or firms ( like banks ) develop better methods of exploiting ordinary consumers , it will show up as higher profits and , when capitalized , as an increase in financial wealth . 
But when this happens , of course , societal wellbeing and economic efficiency fall , even as officially measured wealth rises . 
We simply do not take into account the corresponding diminution of the value of human capital - the wealth of workers . 
Moreover , if banks succeed in using their political influence to socialize losses and retain more and more of their ill-gotten gains , the measured wealth in the financial sector increases . 
We do not measure the corresponding diminution of taxpayers &quot; wealth . 
Likewise , if corporations convince the government to overpay for their products ( as the major drug companies have succeeded in doing ) , or are given access to public resources at below-market prices ( as mining companies have succeeded in doing ) , reported financial wealth increases , though the wealth of ordinary citizens does not . 
What we have been observing - wage stagnation and rising inequality , even as wealth increases - does not reflect the workings of a normal market economy , but of what I call &quot; ersatz capitalism . &quot; 
The problem may not be with how markets should or do work , but with our political system , which has failed to ensure that markets are competitive , and has designed rules that sustain distorted markets in which corporations and the rich can ( and unfortunately do ) exploit everyone else . 
Markets , of course , do not exist in a vacuum . 
There have to be rules of the game , and these are established through political processes . 
High levels of economic inequality in countries like the US and , increasingly , those that have followed its economic model , lead to political inequality . 
In such a system , opportunities for economic advancement become unequal as well , reinforcing low levels of social mobility . 
Thus , Piketty &apos;s forecast of still higher levels of inequality does not reflect the inexorable laws of economics . 
Simple changes - including higher capital-gains and inheritance taxes , greater spending to broaden access to education , rigorous enforcement of anti-trust laws , corporate-governance reforms that circumscribe executive pay , and financial regulations that rein in banks &quot; ability to exploit the rest of society - would reduce inequality and increase equality of opportunity markedly . 
If we get the rules of the game right , we might even be able to restore the rapid and shared economic growth that characterized the middle-class societies of the mid-twentieth century . 
The main question confronting us today is not really about capital in the twenty-first century . 
It is about democracy in the twenty-first century .
