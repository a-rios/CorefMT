Putin &apos;s Rules of Attraction 
CAMBRIDGE - Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s covert aggression in Ukraine continues - and so do Western sanctions against his country . 
But the economy is not all that is under threat ; 
A country can compel others to advance its interests in three main ways : through coercion , payment , or attraction . 
Putin has tried coercion - and been met with increasingly tough sanctions . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Putin &apos;s main European interlocutor , has been expressing her frustration with Russian policy toward Ukraine in increasingly harsh terms . 
Whatever short-term gains Putin &apos;s actions in Ukraine provide will be more than offset in the long term , as Russia loses access to the Western technology it needs to modernize its industry and extend energy exploration into frontier Arctic regions . 
With Russia &apos;s economy faltering , Putin is finding it increasingly difficult to employ the second tool of power : payment . 
Not even oil and gas , Russia &apos;s most valuable resources , can save the economy , as Putin &apos;s recent agreement to supply gas to China for 30 years at knockdown prices demonstrates . 
This leaves attraction - a more potent source of power than one might expect . 
China , for example , has been attempting to use soft power to cultivate a less threatening image - one that it hopes will undermine , and even discourage , the coalitions that have been emerging to counterbalance its rising economic and military might . 
A country &apos;s soft power rests on three main resources : an appealing culture , political values that it reliably upholds , and foreign policy that is imbued with moral authority . 
The challenge lies in combining these resources with hard-power assets like economic and military power so that they reinforce one another . 
The United States failed to strike this balance with respect to its 2003 invasion of Iraq . 
While America &apos;s military power was sufficient to defeat Saddam Hussein &apos;s forces quickly , it did so at the expense of its attractiveness in many countries . 
Likewise , though establishing a Confucius Institute in Manila to teach Filipino people about Chinese culture may help to cultivate China &apos;s soft power , its impact will be severely constrained if China is simultaneously using its hard power to bully the Philippines in the territorial dispute over the Scarborough Shoal . 
The problem for Russia is that it already has very little soft power with which to work . 
Indeed , as the political analyst Sergei Karaganov noted in 2009 , Russia &apos;s lack of soft power is precisely what is driving it to behave aggressively - such as in its war with Georgia the previous year . 
To be sure , Russia has historically enjoyed considerable soft power , with its culture having made major contributions to art , music , and literature . 
Moreover , in the immediate aftermath of World War II , the Soviet Union was attractive to many Western Europeans , owing largely to its leadership in the fight against fascism . 
But the Soviets squandered these soft-power gains by invading Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 . 
By 1989 , they had little soft power left . 
The Berlin Wall did not collapse under a barrage of NATO artillery , but under the impact of hammers and bulldozers wielded by people who had changed their minds about Soviet ideology . 
Putin is now making the same mistake as his Soviet forebears . 
Despite his 2013 declaration that Russia should be focusing on the &quot; literate use &quot; of soft power , he failed to capitalize on the soft-power boost afforded to Russia by hosting the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi . 
Instead , even as the Games were proceeding , Putin launched a semi-covert military intervention in Ukraine , which , together with his talk of Russian nationalism , has induced severe anxiety , particularly among ex-Soviet countries . 
This has undermined Putin &apos;s own stated objective of establishing a Russia-led Eurasian Union to compete with the European Union . 
With few foreigners watching Russian films , and only one Russian university ranked in the global top 100 , Russia has few options for regaining its appeal . 
So Putin has turned to propaganda . 
Last year , Putin reorganized the RIA Novosti news agency , firing 40 % of its staff , including its relatively independent management . 
The agency &apos;s new leader , Dmitry Kiselyov , announced in November the creation of &quot; Sputnik , &quot; a government-funded network of news hubs in 34 countries , with 1,000 staff members producing radio , social media , and news-wire content in local languages . 
But one of the paradoxes of soft power is that propaganda is often counterproductive , owing to its lack of credibility . 
During the Cold War , open cultural exchanges - such as the Salzburg Seminar , which enabled young people to engage with one another - demonstrated that contact among populations is far more meaningful . 
Today , much of America &apos;s soft power is produced not by the government , but by civil society - including universities , foundations , and pop culture . 
Indeed , America &apos;s uncensored civil society , and its willingness to criticize its political leaders , enables the country to preserve soft power even when other countries disagree with its government &apos;s actions . 
Similarly , in the United Kingdom , the BBC retains its credibility because it can bite the government hand that feeds it . 
Yet Putin remains bent on curtailing the role of non-governmental organizations and civil society . 
Putin may understand that hard and soft power reinforce each other , but he remains seemingly incapable of applying that understanding to policy . 
As a result , Russia &apos;s capacity to attract others , if not to coerce and pay them , will continue to decline .
