Transatlantic Free Trade ? 
MADRID - This month , the United States National Intelligence Council released a sobering report entitled Global Trends 2030 : Alternative Worlds . 
Most important , according to the authors , if current trends continue , Asia could soon surpass North America and Europe in global power . 
It will have a higher GDP , larger population , higher military spending , and more technological investment . 
In this geopolitical context , Europe and the US need each other more than ever , making greater transatlantic cooperation crucial . 
This seems to be the approach that inspired outgoing US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &apos;s recent speech at the Brookings Institution on US-European relations . 
Given the shift in global power and the prospect of US energy self-sufficiency as domestic hydrocarbon output booms , America is trying to adapt its foreign policy to the new multi-polar international order . 
And , although Asia is now America &apos;s strategic priority , Europe is still the partner with which Americans have the most in common . 
&quot; I want to be clear , &quot; Clinton noted . 
&quot; Our reorientation toward Asia is not a withdrawal from Europe . &quot; 
The US , according to Clinton , hopes that Europe will follow suit , so that Asia is seen not only as a market , but also as a focus of common strategic action . 
But , beyond that , as the US and Europe seek to ensure their global roles , cooperation between them is more important than ever . 
So now is the time for a bold initiative : the launch of a US-European Union free-trade agreement . 
Clinton has already hinted at America &apos;s readiness for this , mentioning the possibility of negotiating a complete agreement that would increase trade and stimulate growth on both sides of the Atlantic . 
The journalist David Ignatius even dared to give it a name in a recent article in The Washington Post : TAFTA ( Transatlantic Free-Trade Agreement ) . 
Edward Luce , writing in the Financial Times , preferred &quot; Transatlantic Partnership . &quot; 
The US and the EU ( taken as a whole ) are not only the world &apos;s two largest economies and typically the largest commercial partners for other major economies ; they also maintain the world &apos;s largest bilateral trade relationship . 
American investment in Europe is three times higher than it is in Asia . 
European investment in the US is eight times larger than its investments in China and India combined . 
So transatlantic trade is crucial for both economies , particularly for job creation . 
Indeed , it is estimated that one-third of all bilateral US-EU trade consists of internal transfers by companies that operate in both markets . 
Although US and EU tariffs on each other &apos;s marketed manufactured goods are already low ( below 3 % , on average ) , a free-trade agreement would be enormously beneficial in promoting further investment , thereby boosting economic growth and creating more jobs . 
Such an agreement could include trade in goods , services , financial instruments , and agriculture , and would necessitate greater compatibility of European and American regulations and legal norms , implying substantial savings . 
Moreover , the effects of such an agreement would be felt far beyond the US and Europe . 
For example , both have already signed free-trade treaties with various Latin American countries , implying the creation of a geographically enormous free-trade area , which should boost economic resilience in the face of global crisis . 
Indeed , regional free-trade agreements are gaining momentum worldwide . 
The Trans-Pacific Partnership , a free-trade agreement spearheaded by the US , is set to be a game-changer in the Asia-Pacific region , with decisive advances this year putting it on course to be concluded in 2015 . 
Potential signatories include the US , Australia , Malaysia , Vietnam , Singapore , New Zealand , Chile , Peru , Brunei , Canada , Mexico , and perhaps Japan and South Korea . 
The result will be trade liberalization in an area that produces 40 % of global GDP . 
Isn &apos;t it time to consider something similar for Europe and the US ? 
The EU , now confronting a wave of populism and Euro-skepticism , could revive its sense of purpose by committing itself to closer transatlantic cooperation and coordination on trade , to be carried out by the European Commission . 
Such a project has worked before in bringing Europe together ; it can do so again . 
The most precious asset today is confidence , and the mere fact of launching negotiations would generate it in abundance . 
Protectionism is no solution to the crisis , whereas a transatlantic free-trade agreement would favor multilateralism and openness . 
In this sense , it is important to stress the work of the World Trade Organization , the best multilateral forum that the world has for resolving trade disputes . 
Signing a transatlantic trade treaty would be irrefutable proof that the political case for open trade can be made - and won . 
The only way to achieve this is through the clear commitment of political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic , together with private-sector involvement , which is fundamental to sustaining urgently needed economic growth . 
But let &apos;s not wait : faced with predictions of the West &apos;s relative decline , the US and the EU must commit themselves to more union , more cooperation , and more prosperity . 
Today , that means a transatlantic free-trade agreement .
