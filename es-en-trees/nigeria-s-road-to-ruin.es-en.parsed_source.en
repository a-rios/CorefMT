Nigeria &apos;s Road to Ruin 
With so much political friction in Iran and Iraq , it is easy to overlook the growing unrest in Nigeria , the world &apos;s eighth-largest oil exporter . 
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo appears poised to try to amend the country &apos;s constitution to allow himself a chance at a third term . 
To that end , he has marginalized many of his political rivals . 
Vice President Atiku Abubakar - a likely presidential aspirant in 2007 - has been harassed and isolated . 
Ministers suspected of less than full loyalty have been sidelined . 
But Obasanjo &apos;s adversaries have joined the battle , and the president lacks the two-thirds majority needed in both the federal and state legislatures to remain in power after next year . 
Two former Nigerian presidents , Generals Muhammadu Buhari and Ibrahim Babangida , publicly oppose Obasanjo &apos;s constitutional meddling , and several governors of Nigeria &apos;s Muslim-dominated northern states have made clear that they are determined to see Obasanjo off when his term expires in 2007 . 
As a result , the uncertainty surrounding Obasanjo &apos;s plans is increasing sectional tensions . 
At stake is the cohesion of a state that many argue is yet another example of an artificial nation cobbled together by Europeans who did not understand their creation &apos;s social , tribal , and religious forces . 
Northern governors oppose a third term for Obasanjo because they believe it is now their turn to choose Nigeria &apos;s president under a deal , struck with their southern counterparts when democracy was introduced in 1999 , for regional rotation of the presidency . 
Southern governors argue that control of the presidency should remain with the south for years to come , because the north controlled the country during more than three decades of dictatorship . 
Indeed , even southern governors who are not reliable Obasanjo allies appear determined to maintain their influence within the central government by ensuring that the country &apos;s next president is a southerner . 
For the moment , Obasanjo offers them their best opportunity to realize that goal . 
Last December , 16 of Nigeria &apos;s 17 southern governors signed the &quot; Enugu Declaration &quot; in support of the constitutional amendment that would permit him a third term . 
This is a bad time for Nigeria &apos;s federal government to face these distractions . 
The Niger Delta region , home to most of Nigeria &apos;s oil and many of its poor people , is in turmoil . 
In October 2004 , violence in the region forced Obasanjo &apos;s government to negotiate with militia leader Asari Dokubu , after his men attacked a series of Royal Dutch Shell oil facilities and threatened to &quot; burn down the area . &quot; 
In December 2004 , Dokubu &apos;s militias took 75 oil workers hostage and forced Shell to shut down about 10 % of the country &apos;s oil supply . 
Dokubu then forced Obasanjo into a peace deal . 
The deal did not last long . 
After Dokubu renewed threats to oil infrastructure last September , he was arrested on sedition charges and now faces the possibility of execution or life in prison . 
Dokubu &apos;s allies have responded with new attacks . 
A splinter group , the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , has claimed credit for several recent attacks and kidnappings of foreign workers , and says it will not retreat until Delta states gain control of the revenue produced by locally extracted oil . 
There are also fears that the splintering of Dokubu &apos;s militias has created fertile ground in the Delta for Islamist groups . 
A few weeks ago , a previously unknown organization called &quot; The Martyr &apos;s Brigade &quot; claimed credit for attacks on Delta pipelines , raising concerns among multinationals that mercenary resistance in the region is becoming ideological . 
Whatever the motivations of the various groups , a surge of militia attacks and kidnappings over the past several weeks has now shut down roughly 20 % of Nigeria &apos;s oil exports and killed dozens of people . 
Shell has closed key facilities in the Delta after the abduction of several workers . 
Once a verdict is reached in Dokubu &apos;s trial , probably this summer , violence is expected to intensify . 
In addition , religious violence sparked by the Danish cartoons mocking the prophet Muhammad ripped through Nigeria in February . 
Angry Muslim and Christian mobs burned churches and mosques , killing dozens of people in a series of attacks and reprisals that have deepened the sectional divide between the Muslim north and the Christian south . 
If all this turmoil weren &apos;t enough , the discovery of avian flu in the northern provinces further undermines political stability . 
Obasanjo has called on Muslim farmers in the area to cull their birds , a key source of protein in a region where malnutrition is a constant threat . 
In some ways , Nigeria is plagued with the same problems facing Iraq . 
Various ethnic and religious groups , based in different regions , are battling for oil revenue and political clout . 
As in Iraq , the conflict could provoke large-scale bloodletting . 
Yet , unlike Iraq , Nigeria has a recent history of relatively stable democratic governance . 
The country &apos;s factions each have good reason to compromise before the conflict comes to a head . 
Northern governors could , for example , offer the southern states a larger share of Nigeria &apos;s oil revenue in exchange for their support for a northern president . 
But achieving such a compromise won &apos;t be a smooth or predictable process . 
On the contrary , the risks of extended political instability and further large-scale disruptions to Nigeria &apos;s oil output will remain high , at a time when the world can least afford it .
