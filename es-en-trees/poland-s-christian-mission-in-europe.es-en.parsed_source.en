Poland \ u0027s Christian Mission in Europe 
Last week , Poland &apos;s ( ex-communist ) president called for an explicit reference to Europe &apos;s Christian heritage to be inserted into the forthcoming EU constitution . 
Others have only whispered their longing for such a statement . 
Jos√© Casanova explains why Poland publicly took the lead . 
The link between Christianity and European civilization is breaking . 
Western Europe is less and less the core of Christian civilization , and the most dynamic forms of Christianity today are less and less European . 
Yet it is at this moment that Catholic Poland is &quot; rejoining Europe . &quot; 
During the years when West European societies were undergoing their process of secularization - indeed , of &quot; de-Christianization &quot;  - Polish Catholicism underwent an extraordinary revival . 
All attempts by the communist regime to sever the links between the Catholic Church and the Polish nation failed . 
Forced secularization from above - relatively successful in the Soviet Union - failed abjectly . 
The hope that economic development would have the same secularizing effect as in the West also proved false . 
Not unlike 19 th Century Poland &apos;s doomed , romantic uprisings against Tsarist Russia , most European observers viewed the country &apos;s religious vitality under communism as anachronistic , if not reactionary . 
Yet the Poles confounded the Zeitgeist . 
The surprising - some say miraculous - elevation of Cardinal Karol Wojtyla to the Papacy as John Paul II , his triumphal visit to Poland in 1979 , the rise of Solidarity a year later , and the collapse of the Soviet system in 1989 changed the march of history . 
Given this background , it is no surprise that Poland has forged a type of Catholic &quot; Europhobe &quot; who objects to the EU not because of the Euro or some supposed threat to national sovereignty , but because of what Europe represents morally and spiritually . 
These anti-Europe Catholics reject European integration because they think Europe &apos;s secular , materialist , and hedonist values threaten Poland &apos;s Catholic identity . 
They fear the threat of secularization implied by European integration . 
That fear is not unjustified . 
After all , it is a fundamental premise of the theory of secularization that the more modern a society , the more secular it becomes . 
Because modernization , in the sense of catching up with European levels of political , economic , social , and cultural development , is one reason Poland sought integration with the EU , one can anticipate that the general historical pattern of modernization will lead to secularization across Central Europe , including Poland . 
Belief in a progressive religious decline is part of Europe &apos;s definition of what constitutes the modern situation , and this has real consequences for religiosity . 
The assumed normality of belief in the inevitability of secularization tends to reproduce itself , as well as to appear increasingly irreversible . 
Yet it is on this point that Polish Catholicism sees for itself a special , historic role . 
Despite initial ambivalence toward Europe , the Polish Catholic Church has maintained -at least officially - an unambiguous position in support of European integration ever since 1996 , when a delegation of Polish Bishops visited the European Commission in Brussels . 
That position is fully in line with the vision of European unity stressed by the Polish Pope . 
During John Paul II &apos;s 1999 visit to Poland , he stated explicitly his support for EU integration . 
One reason for this positive attitude may be connected with the apostolic assignment the Pope has reserved for the Polish Church . 
As the first Slavic pope in history , John Paul II felt a special mission to liberate the Slavic peoples from communism and to deepen ecumenical dialogue with the predominantly Orthodox churches of Eastern Europe . 
The fall of the Berlin Wall confirmed the Pope in his mission to reunify and spiritually regenerate Christian Europe . 
But the Pope &apos;s vision confronts a Western Europe that he perceives as increasingly pagan , hedonist , and unresponsive to his revivalist message . 
Frustrated , he turned to an Eastern Europe - particularly Catholic Poland - that was seemingly less corrupted by capitalist materialism , urging the region &apos;s peoples to serve as the &quot; spiritual reservoir &quot; of Christian Europe . 
What he discovered , however , was that Western material goods and values were flooding the East and polluting that reservoir . 
Poland &apos;s Catholic bishops , however , accepted the assignment given to them by the Pope and have repeatedly stressed that one of the Church &apos;s goals in a united Europe is to foster a revival of Christianity . 
But given the loss of demand for religion , the supply of surplus Polish priests for a pan-European evangelizing effort is unlikely to change things much . 
Europe &apos;s lukewarm - if not outright hostile - response to John Paul II &apos;s revivalist preaching testifies to the difficulty of this assignment . 
A less ambitious apostolic assignment , however , could work . 
Let Poland prove that the link between modernization and secularization is wrong . 
Let Poland be Poland . 
Let Polonia semper fidelis keep faith with its Catholic identity and tradition while succeeding in its integration within Europe , becoming in the process a &quot; normal &quot; European country . 
In so doing , it could prove that the decline of religion in Europe is not an inevitable process tightly linked to modernization , but a historical choice Europeans have made . 
A modern , religious Poland could force secular Europeans to rethink their assumptions and realize that it is not so much Poland that is out of sync with Europe , but secular Europe that is out of sync with the rest of the world . 
Polish Catholicism has confounded skeptics and critics before . 
It may do so again .
