Four Marijuana Moments 
MEXICO CITY - Latin America and the United States have experienced what one could call a series of &quot; marijuana moments &quot; over the past few weeks . 
Given growing support for ending the senseless and bloody decades-long &quot; war on drugs , &quot; these signs of progress toward decriminalization and legalization should not pass unremarked . 
The first moment took place during the Organization of American States &quot; annual General Assembly , held this year in Antigua , Guatemala , at the beginning of June . 
The OAS Secretary General , José Miguel Insulza , presented a report entitled &quot; The Drug Problem in the Americas , &quot; which had been requested by the region &apos;s heads of state when they met at last year &apos;s Summit of the Americas in Cartagena , Colombia . 
The report was drawn up by experts from almost all OAS member states , and was divided into two parts : an excellent analytical section , and a brief and somewhat exasperating chapter devoted to future scenarios . 
The document itself represents a watershed , because it provides the data needed for a scientific and empirical discussion of an issue that is too often debated in ideological terms . 
The report breaks down the issue in a compelling way : by countries ( producers , transit states , consumers , or all of these ) ; by substances ( marijuana , cocaine , heroin , and synthetic drugs ) ; by links among these illicit substances ; and by the consequences of consumption , production , or trade of each drug for societies , institutions , and international relations . 
The report also states explicitly that decriminalization of marijuana consumption is a legitimate , reasonable , and feasible option , though it does not recommend such a policy . 
This is only an initial step , but it is an enormous one . 
The second &quot; marijuana moment &quot; occurred in the US , where the states of Washington and Colorado have entered the final stages of fully legalizing marijuana usage , following popular referenda last November . 
Both states have just concluded the drafting and publication of the rules and regulations that will translate their referendum results into law : how to forbid consumption by minors ; how to punish consumers driving under the influence ; what kind of taxes and tax rates are most appropriate ; and how non-residents will be treated , among other complicated and controversial issues . 
As legal pioneers in the US , both states will have to proceed by trial and error . 
But perhaps the most interesting and intriguing facet of this process is President Barack Obama &apos;s eloquent indifference to the entire affair . 
So far , at least , he has refused to intercede in the discussion of whether federal law should trump state legislation , having said that he has &quot; bigger fish to fry . &quot; 
The third &quot; marijuana moment &quot; stems from recent decisions in New York and Illinois - the third and fifth most populous US states , respectively - to proceed with legalizing medical marijuana . 
In May , the Illinois legislature passed a highly restrictive bill governing marijuana use for therapeutic purposes , which the governor has not yet decided whether to sign . 
Soon after , the New York State Assembly passed a strict bill on medical marijuana , which the State Senate has yet to vote on . 
If New York and Illinois move forward , they will become the 19th and 20th of the 50 US states that , together with the District of Columbia , permit medical use of marijuana . 
Finally , earlier this month , the US-based international NGO Human Rights Watch formally adopted a stance that rejects criminalization of possession and consumption of all drugs and calls for a radically different approach . 
Most important , HRW did so from a human-rights perspective , and its statement is worth quoting : 
&quot; Subjecting people to criminal sanctions for the personal use of drugs , or for possession of drugs for personal use , infringes on their autonomy and right to privacy . 
The right to privacy is broadly recognized under international law , including in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights . 
Limitations on autonomy and privacy cannot be justified unless they meet the criteria for any restriction of a basic right , namely legitimate purpose , proportionality , necessity , and non-discrimination . 
While protecting health is a legitimate government purpose , criminalizing drug use to protect people from harming themselves does not meet the criteria of necessity or proportionality . &quot; 
None of these recent developments will lead , on its own , to decriminalization . 
International conventions still limit governments &quot; leeway , and the US government remains opposed to any backtracking from the punitive , prohibitionist strategy that it has pursued since 1981 . 
Even the boldest Latin American governments - including those in Colombia , Uruguay , and Guatemala - are reluctant to advance much further , especially if they remain isolated . 
And presidents like Brazil &apos;s Dilma Rousseff , Mexico &apos;s Enrique Peña Nieto , and Argentina &apos;s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner are sticking to their orthodox , conservative , and anachronistic stances , unwilling to budge until public opinion leaves them no other choice . 
Yet something is stirring in the hemisphere ; as its &quot; marijuana moments &quot; arrive with greater frequency , can a milestone be far off ?
