Ukraine and Beyond 
GENEVA - The Ukraine crisis has evolved from acute to chronic . 
The main question - Will Russia dare to invade mainland Ukraine ? - has been answered : Not now . 
So , now what ? 
Obviously , the Kremlin did not expect the West &apos;s firm and united reaction to its annexation of Crimea . 
President Vladimir Putin &apos;s phone call to US President Barack Obama on March 28 clearly demonstrated Russia &apos;s eagerness to discuss &quot; de-escalation . &quot; 
Putin &apos;s main objectives now are the removal of Ukraine &apos;s blockade of Moldova &apos;s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria and Ukrainian &quot; federalization &quot; ( a euphemism for the Kremlin &apos;s back-door strategy to gain control over the country &apos;s eastern and southern regions ) . 
But there can be no return to business as usual anytime soon . 
Russia &apos;s invasion and annexation of Crimea has triggered unintended tectonic shifts in international politics . 
While the long-term implications are still hazy , the immediate consequences are clear . 
First , the Russian people will pay dearly in terms of their own freedom for their leaders &quot; reckless decisions . 
After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 , the Russian poet Alexander Galich wrote : &quot; Compatriots , our homeland is in danger ! 
Our tanks are in a foreign land ! &quot; 
Confrontation with the West , seemingly unavoidable after the Crimea Anschluss , will give rise to a &quot; mobilization &quot; regime . 
Russia &apos;s new draft budget , with its skyrocketing military outlays , along with paranoid talk of &quot; fifth columns &quot; and &quot; national traitors , &quot; attests to this trend . 
In such circumstances , sanctions that hit ordinary people will only help the regime consolidate its power . 
Second , the crisis has several geopolitical ramifications . 
The Kremlin &apos;s actions have undermined European security ; delivered a body blow to international law ; weakened the nuclear non-proliferation regime by fatally undermining the role of security guarantees for non-nuclear states ; and raised doubts about the predictability of Russia under its current leaders . 
All of this will have far-reaching effects in the years and decades ahead , ranging from the realignment of formal and informal alliances and the militarization of security arrangements to possible - and long-discussed - adjustments in the international governance system . 
Russia &apos;s expulsion from the G-8 and renewed military build-ups are only the first of many such changes . 
Third , the Ukraine crisis will completely transform Russia &apos;s relations with the West . 
During the first two decades after the Cold War , a combination of suspicion and pragmatism prevailed on both sides , with competition in some respects and cooperation in others playing a crucial role in coping with important international challenges . 
The relationship &apos;s transformation into an adversarial one will &quot; contaminate &quot; the international system , undermining potential solutionsto many problems , from nuclear-arms reduction and climate change to stabilizing regional hot spots like Syria . 
In response to Western sanctions , the Kremlin will bring pressure to bear on the United States and its allies by creating problems elsewhere . 
For example , Russia has already offered to build two new , non-military nuclear reactors in Iran . 
Technological support for Iran &apos;s nuclear programs could impede the ongoing international negotiations aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons , especially as the Iranians are looking for leverage in the talks . 
Russia could escalate the crisis by putting pressure on the US closer to home as well . 
Consider Venezuela , where - as with Iran &apos;s nuclear program - Russia has demonstrated its willingness to take risks that it would not have taken before . 
On February 26 , Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu formally announced his government &apos;s plan to expand its overseas military presence . 
Venezuela is high on its list , having already purchased more than three-quarters of the $ 14.5 billion in arms sold by Russia in the region from 2001 to 2013 . 
Fourth , having annexed Crimea , Russia has lost Ukraine , turning it from friend to foe . 
Ukraine &apos;s industrial and manufacturing infrastructure evolved under the Soviet Union as a compliment to Russia &apos;s resource base . 
After the Soviet Union &apos;s dissolution , the Russian resource economy &apos;s traditional links with Ukraine , including extensive pipeline infrastructure , ensured access to European markets . 
Now , having lost Ukraine &apos;s industrial and manufacturing base , and with Europe more determined than ever to reduce its dependence on Russian energy supplies , the Kremlin will need to turn eastward toward China , which will be happy to see Russia remain a resource economy in thrall to it . 
Given all of these potential dire consequences , it is vital to prevent Cold War II . 
During the coming transition period , the world will need new mechanisms for international dialogue . 
Isolation of Russia would be counterproductive , merely aggravating its highly developed sense of victimization and possibly turning it into a &quot; rogue &quot; state - truly a nightmare scenario , given that Russia has the world &apos;s largest nuclear arsenal . 
Instead , targeted economic sanctions and calibrated military measures should be coupled with intensive and open political dialogue . 
A personal meeting between US , Russian , and German leaders could be helpful in channeling relations toward a non-destructive course . 
To be truly productive , such contact should not be limited to resolving the Ukraine crisis - or to senior officials . 
The Ukraine crisis should not be allowed to obscure the full range of challenges that the world faces . 
In fact , the standoff is more likely to be resolved constructively within a framework that seeks consensus on a broader agenda . 
After all , any crisis creates new opportunities ( for example , the Syrian civil war has prompted important action on chemical weapons ) . 
The opportunity for Russia and the West is to generate the political will needed to address issues - above all , reform of an outmoded system of international relations - that have been ignored for too long .
