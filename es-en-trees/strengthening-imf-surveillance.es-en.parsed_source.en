Strengthening IMF Surveillance 
In today &apos;s globalized economy , one country &apos;s economic and financial policies can reverberate far beyond its borders . 
Be it the spread of inflation or the impact of currency devaluation half a world away , global economic forces can have a direct impact on every person &apos;s livelihood . 
Under such circumstances , international cooperation is essential to ensure stability and growth and prevent disruptive crises . 
But for such cooperation to be effective , the international community needs the right tools . 
The International Monetary Fund provides one of the most important tools . 
For many years , the IMF has engaged its member countries in a process known as &quot; surveillance , &quot; in which it monitors , analyzes , and consults on each country &apos;s economic policies - both exchange rate policies and relevant domestic policies . 
These regular checkups help to identify potential vulnerabilities and maintain economic stability . 
However , the increasingly complex policy challenges of the globalized economy demand a fresh look at this process . 
This June , the IMF &apos;s Executive Board did just that , reaching a broad consensus on updating surveillance to make it more focused and effective . 
This is one of the most important reforms to the Fund &apos;s work in the 30 years since the surveillance process was designed . 
Indeed , it is part of a much broader reform effort aimed at strengthening the IMF and will have implications extending well beyond the Fund &apos;s boardroom . 
The new reform brings three critical changes . 
First , it affirms that surveillance should focus on what matters for stability , and gives detailed guidance in this area . 
IMF advice should not be spread too thin . 
Second , there is now clear advice to the Fund &apos;s member countries on how they should run their exchange rate policies , and on what is acceptable to the international community . 
Finally , the reform sets out clearly for the first time what is expected of surveillance , and so should promote candor and evenhanded treatment of every country . 
In other words , the Fund must ensure that it deals with every country the same way , including delivering clear and sometimes difficult policy messages and sharing its views with the international community . 
The new approach to exchange rate policies represents one of the most significant advances . 
Under the IMF Articles of Agreement , members are required to collaborate to promote a stable system of exchange rates and to avoid manipulation with a view to gaining an unfair trade advantage . 
Past guidance in this area was limited , focusing entirely on manipulation and on avoidance of short-term volatility . 
This guidance remains , but what we meant by manipulation is now clearer . 
We have also addressed those policies that have caused the most harm to the system in recent years , including overvalued or undervalued exchange rate pegs maintained for domestic reasons . 
This change comes at a crucial time for the world economy . 
Countries are experiencing strong growth , inflation is low , and the threat of crisis has receded considerably . 
Few countries need to borrow from the IMF - a highly positive trend . 
But improved surveillance is essential to ensure that the global economy remains on an even keel . 
By clarifying what surveillance entails , the new decision should help the IMF and its members see eye to eye on the Fund &apos;s role , help those involved in surveillance do their job properly , and make the Fund more accountable for delivering on this key responsibility . 
This reform represents a victory for multilateralism that demonstrates ownership of how Fund surveillance will be strengthened and members &quot; willingness to live up to their responsibilities in the process . 
Of course , it is critically important that it received very broad support from industrial countries , emerging economies , and developing countries . 
The international community needs a setting where it can debate the most sensitive economic issues , including - but certainly not limited to - exchange rate issues . 
The IMF offers that venue . 
At the same time , it can provide the nonpartisan technical expertise that enables governments to define policies that will ensure continued economic stability . 
The goal is to support policies that are good for each member country - but also for other countries - through dialogue and persuasion . 
This is the very essence of international cooperation .
