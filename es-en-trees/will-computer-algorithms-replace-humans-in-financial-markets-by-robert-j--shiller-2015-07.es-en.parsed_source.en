The Mirage of the Financial Singularity 
NEW HAVEN - In their new book The Incredible Shrinking Alpha , Larry E. Swedroe and Andrew L. Berkin describe an investment environment populated by increasingly sophisticated analysts who rely on big data , powerful computers , and scholarly research . 
With all this competition , &quot; the hurdles to achieving alpha &#91; returns above a risk-adjusted benchmark - and thus a measure of success in picking individual investments &#93; are getting higher and higher . &quot; 
That conclusion raises a key question : Will alpha eventually go to zero for every imaginable investment strategy ? 
More fundamentally , is the day approaching when , thanks to so many smart people and smarter computers , financial markets really do become perfect , and we can just sit back , relax , and assume that all assets are priced correctly ? 
This imagined state of affairs might be called the financial singularity , analogous to the hypothetical future technological singularity , when computers replace human intelligence . 
The financial singularity implies that all investment decisions would be better left to a computer program , because the experts with their algorithms have figured out what drives market outcomes and reduced it to a seamless system . 
Many believe that we are almost there . 
Even legendary investors like Warren Buffett , it is argued , are not really outperforming the market . 
In a recent paper , &quot; Buffett &apos;s Alpha , &quot; Andrea Frazzini and David Kabiller of AQR Capital Management and Lasse Pedersen of Copenhagen Business School , conclude that Buffett is not generating significantly positive alpha if one takes account of certain lesser-known risk factors that have weighed heavily in his portfolio . 
The implication is that Buffet &apos;s genius could be replicated by a computer program that incorporates these factors . 
If that were true , investors would abandon , en masse , their efforts to ferret out mispricing in the market , because there wouldn &apos;t be any . 
Market participants would rationally assume that every stock price is the true expected present value of future cash flows , with the appropriate rate of discount , and that those cash flows reflect fundamentals that everyone understands the same way . 
Investors &quot; decisions would diverge only because of differences in their personal situation . 
For example , an automotive engineer might not buy automotive stocks - and might even short them - as a way to hedge the risk to his or her own particular type of human capital . 
Indeed , according to a computer crunching big data , this would be an optimal decision . 
There is a long-recognized problem with such perfect markets : No one would want to expend any effort to figure out what oscillations in prices mean for the future . 
Thirty-five years ago , in their classic paper , &quot; On the Impossibility of Informationally Efficient Markets , &quot; Sanford Grossman and Joseph Stiglitz presented this problem as a paradox : Perfectly efficient markets require the effort of smart money to make them so ; but if markets were perfect , smart money would give up trying . 
The Grossman-Stiglitz conundrum seems less compelling in the financial singularity if we can imagine that computers direct all the investment decisions . 
Although alpha may be vanishingly small , it still represents enough profit to keep the computers running . 
But the real problem with this vision of financial singularity is not the Grossman-Stiglitz conundrum ; it is that real-world markets are nowhere close to it . 
Computer enthusiasts are excited by things like the blockchain used by Bitcoin ( covered on an education website called Singularity University , in a section dramatically titled Exponential Finance ) . 
But the futurists &quot; financial world bears no resemblance to today &apos;s financial world . 
After all , the financial singularity implies that all prices would be based on such things as optimally projected future corporate profits and the correlation of profits with expected technological innovations and long-term demographic changes . 
But the smart money hardly ever talks in such ethereal terms . 
In this context , it is difficult not to think of China &apos;s recent stock-market plunge . 
News accounts depict hordes of emotional people trading on hunch and superstition . 
That looks a lot more like reality than all the talk of impending financial singularity . 
Markets seem to be driven by stories , as I emphasize in my book Irrational Exuberance . 
There are stories of great new eras and of looming depressions . 
There are fundamental stories about technology and declining resources . 
And there are stories about politics and bizarre conspiracies . 
No one knows if these stories are true , but they take on a life of their own . 
Sometimes they go viral . 
When one has a heart-to-heart talk with many seemingly rational people , they turn out to have crazy theories . 
These people influence markets , because all other investors must reckon with them ; and their craziness is not going away anytime soon . 
Maybe Buffett &apos;s past investing style can be captured in a trading algorithm today . 
But that does not necessarily detract from his genius . 
Indeed , the true source of his success may consist in his understanding of when to abandon one method and devise another . 
The idea of financial singularity may seem inspiring ; but it is no less illusory than the rational Utopia that inspired generations of central planners . 
Human judgment , good and bad , will drive investment decisions and financial-market outcomes for the rest of our lives and beyond .
