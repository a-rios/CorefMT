The Greek Tragedy , Act II 
CHICAGO - A Greek tragedy is typically composed of three acts . 
The first sets the scene . 
For current-day Greece , the imposition of &quot; voluntary &quot; losses on the country &apos;s private creditors represents just the end of the beginning . 
The real tragedy has still to unfold . 
On the face of it , the &quot; voluntary &quot; arrangement with creditors might appear to have been a big success . 
The volume of Greece &apos;s foreign debt has been reduced by more than € 100 billion ( $ 130 billion ) . 
As a result , Greece has avoided generalized bank failures , and it has been able to continue paying its public employees . 
But , despite these trumpeted results , the reality is much harsher . 
Even with the latest deal , Greece &apos;s debt ratio remains at 120 % of last year &apos;s GDP . 
With a projected drop in GDP of 7 % this year and a sustained deficit , the debt ratio would exceed 130 % before stabilizing at 120 % in 2020 . 
But even this reduced level is not sustainable . 
With its population set to contract by 0.5 % annually over the next 30 years , even if per capita income in Greece were to rise at the German rate of 1.5 % per year , the debt would be difficult to service . 
Assuming that Greece could borrow at a real interest rate of only 3 % ( the current level is 17 % ) , the government would need to run an annual 2.6 % -of-GDP primary budget surplus ( the fiscal balance minus debt-service costs ) for the next 30 years just to keep the debt burden stable . 
To put that task in perspective , in the last 25 years , Greece ran an average primary deficit of 2 % per year . 
To reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 70 % , Greece would have to maintain an average primary surplus of 4 % for the next 30 years , a level that it has temporarily achieved in only four of the last 25 years . 
If the situation is so dramatic , why are the European Union and the International Monetary Fund celebrating the recent agreement ? 
Simply put , these institutions &quot; primary objective was to minimize the repercussions that a Greek default would have on the international financial system . 
Greece , frankly , was not their priority . 
Given the reaction in financial markets , they have succeeded . 
The delay in reaching an agreement enabled most private creditors to escape the consequences of their reckless lending to Greece . 
Roughly half of Greece &apos;s external debt migrated from the private sector to official institutions . 
But the group of lenders that the EU and the IMF wanted to help the most - the banks - only partly reduced their exposure . 
Between May 2010 and September 2011 , the value of Greek sovereign debt held by French banks dropped by € 4.6 billion ( 39 % ) , while German banks reduced their holdings by € 2.9 billion ( 31 % ) and Italian banks by € 530 million ( 30 % ) . 
In part , this drop reflects the reduction in market value of the existing liabilities . 
Thus , on average , banks have sold very little . 
But , while private-sector losses have been minimized , at what price ? 
Had Greece defaulted on its debt in 2010 , imposing the same &quot; haircut &quot; on private creditors as it has imposed now , it would have reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio to a more manageable 80 % . 
That would have been painful , but it could have spared the Greeks from a 7 % decline in GDP and a rise in unemployment to 22 % ( including an increase in youth unemployment to a whopping 48 % ) . 
More importantly , a default in 2010 would have left some room for adjustments . 
Under the current plan , there is none : if the economy does not turn around quickly , Greece will need more help . 
But where can it go now to find it ? 
Most of the sovereign debt is now held by the official sector , which traditionally does not allow any haircut . 
The remainder has been reissued under English , not Greek , law , putting it outside of the control of the Greek government and its new collective-action clause , which facilities partial defaults . 
In other words , Greece has exhausted its ability to share part of the burden with the private sector . 
Next time , Europe &apos;s taxpayers will be on the hook . 
The second act of the Greek tragedy will cast desperate Greeks against angry and disenchanted Europeans elsewhere . 
Only at the climax will we know whether the effort to delay the inevitable contributed to undermining the idea of Europe for the current generation .
