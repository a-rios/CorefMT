Building a Caring Economy 
DAVOS - Today &apos;s mainstream economic models are based on two fundamental assumptions : first , humans are essentially selfish actors who act rationally to advance their own utility - so-called homo economicus ; but , second , as Adam Smith &apos;s metaphor of an &quot; invisible hand &quot; was intended to suggest , self-regarding behavior can inadvertently advance the common good . 
Both assumptions are patently false . 
In order to address pressing global problems like climate change and inequality , the predominant economic models must be rethought , incorporating other motivational systems that can induce different human behaviors . 
Such realistic models , based on empirical research in psychology and the neurosciences , would allow societies to cultivate their sense of compassion and build a new kind of &quot; caring economics &quot; that reflects more fully what it is to be human . 
Neuroscientific studies have shown that humans can be motivated by care and systems of affiliation just as easily as they can be by power and achievement or consumption and desire . 
After all , we have evolved to be able to form stable relationships , build trust , and care for children , all of which requires a capacity for compassion and empathy . 
Once we recognize that these caring motivational systems are common to all humans - indeed , most are shared with other animals - the world begins to look very different . 
It is important , however , to distinguish between basic empathic responses and a more universal capacity for compassion . 
Empathy alone does not necessarily prompt pro-social behavior ; empathizing with the suffering of another may not drive you to help that person . 
In fact , empathy can result in distress , which may even lead to withdrawal or burnout . 
Compassion , by contrast , is concern for another person that is linked to a strong motivation to alleviate their suffering . 
If , say , a mother sees her child crying after a fall , she may first empathize with the child , feeling its pain and sadness . 
But , rather than succumbing to feelings of distress , she will take the child in her arms to soothe and comfort it . 
Both empathy and compassion seem to come naturally to humans . 
But both responses are fragile , and can be quelled or reversed by a large number of factors - including the degree to which we identify with the person who is suffering . 
Humans tend to find it easy to empathize with and care about members of their &quot; in-group &quot; - people with whom they share features , whether real or socially constructed , like race , gender , age , or religious affiliation . 
Empathy and care toward out-group members does not come quite as easily . 
Such universal or global compassion - caring about people who are very different from us - probably requires the involvement of higher cognitive functions , and thus may be unique to humans . 
It may also require some training . 
After all , living in a world that assumes we are homo economicus can encourage selfish habits . 
Fortunately , research suggests that such habits can be broken . 
The largest such study is the recently completed ReSource project , in which my colleagues and I subjected almost 300 people , over 11 months , to an intense mental-training program , developed by a team of experienced mediation teachers , scientists , and psychotherapists . 
The goal was to cultivate a broad range of mental capacities and social skills , including attention , mindfulness , self-awareness , perspective-taking on others , empathy , compassion , and the ability to cope with difficult emotions like anger or stress . 
Progress was assessed by measuring changes in participants &quot; brains , hormones , health , behavior , and subjective sense of wellbeing . 
The project &apos;s preliminary results reinforce a key finding of previous , smaller studies : just as we can strengthen and transform a muscle through physical exercise , we can develop our brain and behavioral capacities - from attention and emotional regulation to trust and donation behavior - through regular mental training . 
Of course , mental exercises must be honed to develop particular skills and behaviors ; mindfulness practice alone is not adequate to improve , say , socio-cognitive skills . 
And lasting changes occur only after a prolonged period of regular training . 
But , with the right approach , it may well be possible to foster the kind of altruistic and pro-social behaviors that are needed to improve global cooperation . 
On the basis of these findings and those from other psychological , neuroscientific , and economic studies , my colleagues and I are now working with the president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy , Dennis Snower , to formulate new motivation-based computational models of economic decision-making . 
These models will enable us to make clear , testable predictions about expected monetary-exchange behavior in an economic context , including in addressing common-good problems . 
In fact , several of these experiments are already underway . 
The secular , ethical mental-training exercises used in the ReSource project could be applied in businesses , political institutions , schools ( for both teachers and students ) , and health-care settings - in short , in all areas where people experience high levels of stress and related phenomena . 
Young children , in particular , could benefit considerably from such training programs , which could enable them to use mental skills and compassion to regulate stress and emotions . 
Policymakers should take the lead in promoting this science-based approach to learning and working , such as by redesigning institutions to emphasize collaboration . 
Several governments - including that of the United Kingdom - have developed so-called &quot; nudge units , &quot; which seek to encourage people to make better choices for themselves and society by providing subtle hints , cues , and other suggestions . 
A lack of compassion is arguably the cause of many of humankind &apos;s most devastating failures . 
Our success in tackling the enormous challenges we face will depend not only on our willingness to work actively and cooperatively to advance the common good , but also on our ability to foster the attributes needed to do so .
