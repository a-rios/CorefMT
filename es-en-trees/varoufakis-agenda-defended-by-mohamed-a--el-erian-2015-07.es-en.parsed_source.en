In Defense of Varoufakis 
LONDON - From blaming him for the renewed collapse of the Greek economy to accusing him of illegally plotting Greece &apos;s exit from the eurozone , it has become fashionable to disparage Yanis Varoufakis , the country &apos;s former finance minister . 
While I have never met or spoken to him , I believe that he is getting a bad rap ( and increasingly so ) . 
In the process , attention is being diverted away from the issues that are central to Greece &apos;s ability to recover and prosper - whether it stays in the eurozone or decides to leave . 
That is why it is important to take note of the ideas that Varoufakis continues to espouse . 
Greeks and others may fault him for pursuing his agenda with too little politesse while in office . 
Following an impressive election victory by his Syriza party in January , Greece &apos;s prime minister , Alexis Tsipras , appointed Varoufakis to lead the delicate negotiations with the country &apos;s creditors . 
His mandate was to recast the relationship in two important ways : render its terms more amenable to economic growth and job creation ; and restore balance and dignity to the treatment of Greece by its European partners and the International Monetary Fund . 
These objectives reflected Greece &apos;s frustrating and disappointing experience under two previous bailout packages administered by &quot; the institutions &quot; ( the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the IMF ) . 
In pursuing them , Varoufakis felt empowered by the scale of Syriza &apos;s electoral win and compelled by economic logic to press three issues that many economists believe must be addressed if sustained growth is to be restored : less and more intelligent austerity ; structural reforms that better meet social objectives ; and debt reduction . 
These issues remain as relevant today , with Varoufakis out of government , as they were when he was tirelessly advocating for them during visits to European capitals and in tense late-night negotiations in Brussels . 
Indeed , many observers view the agreement on a third bailout program that Greece reached with its creditors - barely a week after Varoufakis resigned - as simply more of the same . 
At best , the deal will bring a respite - one that is likely to prove both short and shallow . 
In part , the criticism of Varoufakis reflects less the substance of his proposals than the manner in which he approached his interlocutors . 
Eschewing the traditional duality of frank private discussions and restrained public commentary , he aggressively advocated his case openly and bluntly , and did so in an increasingly personal manner . 
Whether deemed naive or belligerent , this approach undeniably upset and angered European politicians . 
Rather than modifying a policy framework that had failed for five years to deliver on its stated objectives , they dug in their heels , eventually resorting to the economic equivalent of gunboat diplomacy . 
Now that he is out of office , Varoufakis is being blamed for much more than failing to adapt his approach to political reality . 
Some hold him responsible for the renewed collapse of the Greek economy , the unprecedented shuttering of the banking system , and the imposition of stifling capital controls . 
Others are calling for criminal investigations , characterizing the work he led on a Plan B ( whereby Greece would introduce a new payments system either in parallel or instead of the euro ) as tantamount to treason . 
But , love him or hate him ( and , it seems , very few people who have encountered him feel indifferent ) , Varoufakis was never the arbiter of Greece &apos;s fate . 
Yes , he should have adopted a more conciliatory style and shown greater appreciation for the norms of European negotiations ; and , yes , he overestimated Greece &apos;s bargaining power , wrongly assuming that pressing the threat of Grexit would compel his European partners to reconsider their long-entrenched positions . 
Varoufakis had no control over the economic mess that Syriza inherited when it came to power , including an unemployment rate hovering around 25 % and youth joblessness that had been running at more than 50 % for a considerable period . 
He could not influence in any meaningful manner the national narratives that had sunk deep roots in other European countries and thus undermined those countries &quot; ability to adapt . 
He could not counter the view among some of the region &apos;s politicians that success for Syriza would embolden and strengthen other non-traditional parties around Europe . 
It also would have been irresponsible for Varoufakis not to work behind closed doors on a Plan B. After all , Greece &apos;s eurozone destiny largely was - and remains - in the hands of others ( particularly Germany , the ECB , and the IMF ) . 
When push came to shove , Varoufakis faced the difficult choice of going along with more of the same , despite knowing that it would fail , or trying to pivot to a new approach . 
He bravely opted for the latter . 
While his brash style undermined outcomes , it would be a real tragedy to lose sight of his arguments ( which have been made by many others as well ) . 
If Greece is to have any realistic chance of long-term economic recovery and meeting its citizens &quot; legitimate aspirations , policymakers must recast the country &apos;s austerity program , couple pro-growth reforms with greater social justice , and secure additional debt relief .
