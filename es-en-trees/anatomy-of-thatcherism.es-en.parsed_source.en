Anatomy of Thatcherism 
London - Thirty years ago this month , Margaret Thatcher came to power . 
Although precipitated by local conditions , the Thatcher ( or more broadly the Thatcher-Reagan ) revolution became an instantly recognizable global brand for a set of ideas that inspired policies to free markets from government interference . 
Three decades later , the world is in a slump , and many people attribute the global crisis to these very ideas . 
Indeed , even beyond the political left , the Anglo-American model of capitalism is deemed to have failed . 
It is held culpable for the near financial meltdown . 
But 30 years of hindsight enable us to judge which elements of the Thatcher revolution should be preserved , and which should be amended in the light of today &apos;s global economic downturn . 
Most obviously in need of amendment is the view that minimally managed and regulated markets are both more stable and more dynamic than those subject to extensive government intervention . 
The Thatcherite assumption , in other words , was that government failure is far more menacing to prosperity than market failure . 
This was always bad history . 
The record shows that the period 1950-1973 , when government intervention in market economies was at its peacetime height , was uniquely successful economically , with no global recessions and faster rates of GDP growth - and growth of GDP per capita - than in any comparable period before or since . 
One can argue that economic performance would have been even better with less government intervention . 
But perfect markets are no more available than perfect governments . 
All we have are comparisons between what happened at different times . 
What these comparisons show is that markets plus government have done better than markets minus government . 
Nevertheless , by the 1970 &quot; s the pre-Thatcher political economy was in crisis . 
The most notorious symptom of this was the emergence of &quot; stagflation &quot; - simultaneously rising inflation and unemployment . 
Something had gone wrong with the system of economic management bequeathed by John Maynard Keynes . 
In addition , government spending was on the rise , labor unions were becoming more militant , policies to control pay kept breaking down , and profit expectations were falling . 
It seemed to many as though government &apos;s reach had come to exceed its grasp , and that either its grasp had to be strengthened or its reach had to be reduced . 
Thatcherism emerged as the most plausible alternative to state socialism . 
Nigel Lawson was Thatcher &apos;s second Chancellor of the Exchequer , or finance minister . 
Out of the government &apos;s anti-inflationary efforts emerged the &quot; Lawson doctrine , &quot; first stated in 1984 and broadly accepted by governments and central banks ever since . 
&quot; The conquest of inflation , &quot; Lawson said , &quot; should ... be the objective of macroeconomic policy . 
And the creation of conditions conducive to growth and employment should be ... the objective of microeconomic policy . &quot; 
This proposition overturned the previous Keynesian orthodoxy that macroeconomic policy should aim at full employment , with the control of inflation left to wage policy . 
Yet , despite all the &quot; supply side &quot; reforms introduced by Thatcherite governments , unemployment has been much higher since 1980 than in the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s - 7.4 % on average in the United Kingdom , compared to 1.6 % in the earlier decades . 
What about inflation targeting ? 
Here , too , the record since 1980 has been patchy , despite the huge deflationary pressure exerted by low-wage competition from Asia . 
Inflation in 1950-1973 and 1980-2007 was about the same - just over 3 % - while inflation targeting has failed to prevent a succession of asset bubbles that have brought recessions in their wake . 
Nor has Thatcherite policy succeeded in one of its chief aims - to reduce the share of government spending in national income . 
The most one can say is that it halted the rise for a time . 
Now public spending is on the increase again , and record peacetime deficits of 10 % or more of GDP stretch ahead for years . 
In de-regulating financial markets worldwide , the Thatcher-Reagan revolution brought about the corruption of money , without improving on the previous growth of wealth - except for the very wealthy . 
The average world citizen would have been 20 % richer had world GDP per capita grown at the same rate between 1980 and 2007 as it did between 1950 and 1973 - and this despite China &apos;s high growth rates in the past 20 years . 
Furthermore , in unleashing the power of money , the Thatcherites , for all their moralizing , contributed to the moral decay of the West . 
Against these formidable minuses are three pluses . 
The first is privatization . 
By returning most state-owned industries to private ownership , the Thatcher revolution killed off state socialism . 
The British privatization program &apos;s greatest influence was in the former communist states , to which it gave the ideas and techniques needed to dismantle grossly inefficient command economies . 
This gain must be preserved in the face of the current clamor to &quot; nationalize &quot; banks . 
Thatcherism &apos;s second success was to weaken trade unions . 
Set up to protect the weak against the strong , labor unions had become , by the 1970 &quot; s , enemies of economic progress , a massive force of social conservatism . 
It was right to encourage a new economy to grow outside these congealed structures . 
Finally , Thatcherism put paid to the policy of fixing prices and wages by central diktat or by tripartite &quot; bargains &quot; between governments , employers , and trade unions . 
These were the methods of fascism and communism , and they would , in the end , have destroyed not just economic , but political , liberty . 
Political pendulums often swing too far . 
In rebuilding the shattered post-Thatcherite economy , we should be careful not to revive the failed policies of the past . 
I still find fruitful Keynes &apos;s distinction between the agenda and the non-agenda of politics . 
As long as central government takes responsibility for maintaining a high and stable level of employment , Keynes thought , most of the rest of economic life can be left free of official interference . 
Building a proper division of responsibility between state and market from this insight is today &apos;s main task .
