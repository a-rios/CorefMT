Toward a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union ? 
FRANKFURT - Since Europe &apos;s Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) was created , no progress toward political unification has been made - or even really attempted . 
Now that Europe &apos;s current crisis has convinced many that existing institutional arrangements are unsustainable , this may be about to change . 
But should it ? 
According to the presidents of the European Commission , the Euro Summit , the Eurogroup , the European Central Bank , and the European Parliament , the answer is yes . 
Indeed , in a recent report , they call for progress toward a &quot; deep , genuine , and fair &quot; EMU ; economic , financial , and fiscal union ; and a political union that provides the foundation for the rest &quot; through genuine democratic accountability , legitimacy , and institutional strengthening . &quot; 
The report echoes similar proposals by academics , journalists , and other public officials , including , most notably , French President Fran√ßois Hollande . 
In my view , however , the report , like the proposal to establish a European finance minister , is fundamentally flawed . 
While the report contains a number of important observations , its underlying assumption - that steps toward all of its goals should be taken in parallel , with a genuine political union emerging at the end of the process - is problematic . 
After all , establishing a political union would require amendments to national constitutions and , in most countries , referendums . 
But voters are far from enthusiastic about the prospect of ceding more authority to Europe . 
Initially , monetary union was supposed to propel Europe toward political union . 
But the euro is no longer a strong common currency that reinforces a shared European identity . 
On the contrary , it is now a source of deep resentment among European peoples - resentment that , 70 years after the end of World War II , was supposed to have been eliminated . 
To be sure , many have suggested that the current crisis represents a vital opportunity to overcome these tensions and build an ever-closer union , citing the belief of Jean Monnet , one of the European Union &apos;s main architects , that crises are critical to spur progress toward integration . 
But can this approach work at a time when there is so little trust among member countries ? 
Or would pushing forward under such circumstances create even more resistance ? 
The five presidents recommend launching their proposed agenda to reinvigorate integration only after 2017 . 
It seems likely that this timing reflects the fear that voters in the biggest countries , where elections will be held in the next two years , will react negatively to the proposal . 
This is not a sign of great confidence in the suggested procedure . 
The reality is that a European political union is unlikely to be established anytime soon . 
And without true political unification , efforts to pursue the rest of the presidents &quot; plan , including the transfer of fiscal competencies to the European level , would carry serious risks . 
Fiscal integration is high on the five presidents &quot; agenda . 
Although the Stability and Growth Pact has lost more and more respect ( indeed , it is now to be applied , according to the European Commission , purely according to national leaders &quot; discretion ) , it would remain the anchor for fiscal stability and confidence . 
The report also specifies that a genuine fiscal union would require &quot; more joint decision-making on fiscal policy . &quot; 
The presidents insist that this &quot; would not mean centralization of all aspects of revenue and expenditure policy , &quot; with member states continuing to decide on taxation and the allocation of budgetary expenditures . 
But &quot; as the euro area evolves towards a genuine EMU , &quot; they explain , &quot; decisions will increasingly need to be made collectively , &quot; perhaps through a eurozone treasury . 
Limited or not , this is a transfer of fiscal responsibility to the European level . 
And it is difficult to imagine how the report &apos;s call for &quot; democratic accountability and legitimacy &quot; in the decision-making process can be met without a full-fledged political union . 
There is a fundamental conflict between the call to give priority to European needs and the dictates of member states &quot; constitutions , which cannot be resolved by gradually shifting competences de facto from the national to the European level , or by expanding the EU budget . 
Within the existing institutional framework , political responsibility for higher transfer payments among countries must remain with the national governments , controlled by national parliaments and electorates . 
Political union may remain possible in the distant future . 
It cannot , however , be achieved through the back door , by eroding members &quot; fiscal-policy sovereignty . 
Attempting to compel transfer payments would generate moral hazard on the part of the recipients and resistance from the donors , with the resulting increase in tensions possibly jeopardizing the integration that has been achieved so far . 
Given this , for a considerable period of time , Europe &apos;s monetary union will have to exist without political union . 
In other words , the EMU will remain an institutional arrangement among individual countries that retain their fiscal sovereignty . 
The key to making such a system work is to ensure that national governments are held accountable for their economic policies . 
All treaties and commitments - including , crucially , the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s &quot; no bailout &quot; clause - must be respected without exception . 
Pacta sunt servanda - agreements must be honored . 
If this principle is permanently violated , how can one expect a prosperous future based on a new set of treaties that are even more demanding than the existing ones ?
