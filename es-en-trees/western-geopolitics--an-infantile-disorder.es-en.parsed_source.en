Western Geopolitics : An Infantile Disorder 
Recent statements from some American leaders and NATO representatives give the impression that not only Islamic and other radicals , but also quite civilized figures , are losing their grasp of reality and have begun acting irrationally . 
The world is becoming an increasingly difficult place to predict and manage , especially for those who are accustomed to being in charge . 
The mistakes of the past decade will exact a very high price . 
Three countries - Pakistan , India , and North Korea - have been allowed to develop nuclear weapons , proving that there are no remaining political or moral arguments against nuclear proliferation , only air strikes or bribery . 
Instead of a dialogue of civilizations and support for modernist forces in the Middle East , preference has been given to an almost opposite course of action . 
The invasion of Iraq destroyed a very unpleasant tyranny , but it has inspired a wave of hatred towards the West , even among those who despised Saddam , and has divided the West against itself . 
Indeed , anti-American coalitions have appeared not only in the Middle East but also in Latin America , while some Western politicians have apparently sought to aggravate relationships with Russia and China in order to restore transatlantic solidarity and further weaken Europe . 
For example , there is talk of installing anti-missile defense systems in Poland in proximity to the Russian border , supposedly to prevent terrorist missile strikes , which by definition cannot reach Poland . 
There is also talk of NATO accession by Australia , South Korea , Japan , and New Zealand . 
None of these countries needs NATO , but the smell of PATO , CENTO , SEATO , and other long forgotten pacts and pseudo pacts is again in the air . 
Similarly , NATO &apos;s Parliamentary Assembly has announced preparations for NATO accession by such countries as Croatia , Macedonia , and even Albania , all of which fall short of the alliance &apos;s traditional membership criteria . 
More importantly , the United States and Ukraine are talking seriously about Ukraine &apos;s rapid accession to NATO , by 2008 . 
NATO expansion is sought by those in Ukraine who are not sure of themselves and the viability of the Ukrainian state , are afraid of a competitive Russia , and would like to bind their state , militarily and politically , to the US . 
But this betrays a profound lack of understanding of the consequences of Ukraine &apos;s accession to NATO . 
It is unlikely , for example , that Ukraine could remain without a demarcated border with Russia . 
However , if a real border is to be created - it currently exists only on paper and provides income for corrupt customs officials - huge problems will arise . 
Every hill will become strategic , and every gully will become historic . 
They will be fought for , and bloodshed is not hard to imagine . 
Millions of families will be divided , and millions of people who work on the other side of the border may lose their jobs . 
Do those who support NATO &apos;s expansion to Ukraine understand this ? 
Some may , but it seems that the majority simply do not recall or consider the lessons of recent history . 
Of course , Russia is not Serbia . 
It will survive NATO &apos;s further enlargement , although it will be weakened temporarily and pushed into anti-Western alliances . 
Many Russian officials will lose patience with Russia &apos;s remaining a status-quo power , and one hopes that they will not seek confrontation . 
Immeasurably larger damage will be done to Ukraine : it will lose a vital partner , one that perhaps has not always been ideal , but that nonetheless has never inflicted any damage and has never allied with other countries against it . 
If this happens , everyone will lose - apart from terrorists and radicals of every stripe . 
Nobody can afford so seriously dangerous an expansion of NATO into Ukraine . 
Let us hope , therefore , that reason - and the instinct of self-preservation - will ultimately prevail .
