Europe &apos;s Financial Wasteland 
PARIS - &quot; April is the cruelest month , &quot; wrote T.S. Eliot at the beginning of his great poem , &quot; The Waste Land . &quot; 
But , if Eliot had been a professional investor who had observed European financial markets over the last few years , I am quite certain that his choice would have been August . 
In August 2007 , the decision by BNP Paribas to close two of its hedge funds exposed to the subprime sector precipitated a liquidity crisis for all European banks during that summer . 
This year , BNP &apos;s great rival , Société Générale , has been in the spotlight . 
Its stock fell by more than 14 % in one day in mid-August , plumbing depths not seen for two and a half years . 
Rumors have swirled about a possible downgrade of France &apos;s sovereign debt , accompanied by speculation about the consequences for French banks . 
Since the French , of all continental Europeans , most respect the convention that no useful work should be done in the month of August , this is harsh treatment for their bankers . 
They have not been slow to claim that they are being singled out unfairly . 
They have a point . 
There is much - too much - competition for that position . 
Greece was an early favorite in the race to claim it , but faced a stiff challenge for a time from Ireland . 
Portugal made a sprint towards the front , but is now falling back a little , with Spain and Italy moving up . 
France likes to think that it is at the back of the field , strolling leisurely in lockstep with Germany . 
The evolution of the crisis has , however , thrown European banks &quot; balance sheets into sharp focus . 
Eurozone governments have proven unwilling , or unable , to produce a solution that persuades markets that they are on top of the problem . 
It seems inevitable now that either the eurozone will have to contract , with parts of the uncompetitive periphery dropping out , at least for a time , or that member countries &quot; debts will have to be collectively guaranteed , which implies some form of fiscal union . 
Nothing less will persuade investors to go near debt issues from the eurozone &apos;s fiscally challenged members . 
The political problem is that the second solution cannot yet be sold to German voters , let alone to nationalist fringe parties like France &apos;s National Front and Finland &apos;s True Finns . 
Perhaps it will be possible to persuade the Germans if the alternative is eurozone collapse , which would put the Deutschemark , or a Northern Euro , in the uncomfortable position that the Swiss franc occupies today - too strong for its own good . 
But things might have to get worse before the political mood swings . 
In the meantime , the European Council continues , as the Americans would put it , to &quot; kick the can down the road . &quot; 
Of course , the can is not in the road ; it is in the banking parlors . 
EU banks are holding sovereign debt that clearly is not worth 100 cents on the euro . 
But even the financial &quot; stress tests &quot; conducted by regulators did not require the banks to acknowledge that inconvenient truth . 
Many eurozone banks have made far less progress in strengthening their capital adequacy and liquidity than have American and British banks since the financial crisis erupted . 
The disparities were exposed in the IMF &apos;s last Global Financial Stability Report , published in April , which contains a striking analysis that shows the changes in tangible common equity over the last two years , and the degree to which banks are reliant on wholesale funding . 
One EU central banker described this to me as the &quot; killer chart . &quot; 
What it shows is that banks in the United States have increased their equity from about 5.5 % to about 7.5 % , and have reduced their reliance on wholesale funding from 30 % to 25 % . 
British banks have made less progress with tangible common equity , rising from just under 3 % to a little over 4 % , but they have significantly reduced their reliance on wholesale funding , from almost 45 % in 2008 to less than 35 % now . 
By contrast , eurozone banks have almost stood still on both indicators . 
Their capital has risen a little , but remains below that of banks in the United Kingdom ( and well below that of US banks ) , and they continue to depend on the wholesale markets for almost 45 % of their total funding . 
That is why continuing uncertainty about the integrity of the eurozone , and the value of its members &quot; sovereign debt , is proving so damaging to its banks . 
Will it be possible for them to rollover their market funding in these circumstances ? 
Already , the Greeks and the other countries subject to special measures have been shut out of the wholesale markets , and are reliant almost entirely on the European Central Bank . 
Might that happen to banks elsewhere ? 
In 2007-2008 , the sins of the bankers were visited on the politicians ; now the reverse is true . 
Perhaps there is a difference : the bankers &quot; sins were sins of commission , while the politicians &quot; sins - repeated failed efforts to produce a solution to match the scale of the problem - are sins of omission . 
But the consequences are equally grave . 
I have always assumed that the Germans would eventually recognize that their interests lie in preserving the eurozone intact . 
As Churchill said of the Americans , &quot; you can always rely on them to do the right thing ... once they have exhausted all possible alternatives . &quot; 
The Germans have now almost run out of alternatives . 
If they do not do the right thing soon , there will be some banking casualties , and European governments will once again be obliged to put in public money . 
That will be just as unpopular as bailing out the Greeks , and probably much more expensive .
