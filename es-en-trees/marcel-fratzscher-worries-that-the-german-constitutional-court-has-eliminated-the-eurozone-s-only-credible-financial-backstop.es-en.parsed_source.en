Germany &apos;s Pyrrhic Victory 
BERLIN - The German Constitutional Court has ruled against the European Central Bank &apos;s pledge to buy potentially unlimited quantities of distressed eurozone countries &quot; government bonds , and has called on the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) to confirm its decision . 
Until that happens , the &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; ( OMT ) scheme is effectively dead , weakening the ECB &apos;s ability to act as an effective and credible financial-market backstop at a time when European governments remain unwilling to fill the void . 
The German court considers OMT a violation of the ban on monetary financing of governments . 
According to the court , the scheme can be legal only if it is limited in size ex ante , rules out losses on sovereign debt , and avoids &quot; interferences with price formation on the market . &quot; 
The problem is that almost all ECB policies would violate these principles , which is why the ruling represents a severe setback for Europe . 
To be sure , the ECB could , in principle , still use OMT , at least until the ECJ rules on the case . 
In practice , however , rising opposition in Germany to OMT and other ECB policies will make it impossible to use the program as intended - that is , to intervene effectively in sovereign-bond markets to stem a panic . 
Limiting the ECB &apos;s purchases of government bonds ex ante , as the German court requires , would be nonsensical , because it could easily invite market speculation . 
As a result , the ECB will have to use alternative policy tools to deal with dysfunctional financial markets . 
The court &apos;s ruling strengthens Germany &apos;s government and those in its parliament who want less support for crisis countries and oppose a further transfer of sovereignty to Europe . 
Given the disagreement surrounding the OMT program and eager to avoid future court rulings , the German Parliament could be inclined to support only those rescue programs that rule out OMT support , such as the European Stability Mechanism &apos;s &quot; precautionary conditioned credit line , &quot; instead of the more flexible &quot; enhanced conditions credit line . &quot; 
This is ultimately bad news , as it will limit the European Stability Mechanism &apos;s effectiveness . 
Portugal could be the first test case if it applies for an ESM backstop in the coming months , though its position may be sound enough not to require OMT support . 
How financial markets will digest the German court &apos;s ruling remains uncertain . 
There may be little initial reaction to the news , as there is no immediate threat to financial stability in the eurozone . 
The tight feedback loop between sovereigns and banks in eurozone countries has become even more salient in recent years , as banks are holding an ever-larger share of their home countries &quot; government bonds . 
The ECB &apos;s impaired ability to address sovereign and currency risks means that it will have to break the feedback loop via the banks - a more difficult and less effective approach that increases the likelihood of a market panic and a deeper crisis . 
Nonetheless , limiting the ECB &apos;s ability to address the interdependence of sovereigns and banks could put stronger pressure on eurozone policymakers to confront banking problems directly . 
The ECB &apos;s coming asset-quality review and subsequent stress tests of European banks could be the last chance to repair Europe &apos;s banking system and avoid Japanese-style long-term economic drag from the financial system . 
In this sense , the German court &apos;s ruling highlights the need for swift completion of a European banking union , including well-functioning supervisory and resolution mechanisms . 
Finally , the case highlights the need for a treaty change . 
The court &apos;s decision to accept the case against the OMT program could unleash a flood of lawsuits against European institutions , such as the ECB and the ESM , whenever member states &quot; citizens disapprove of their actions . 
The ruling is a call on policymakers to pursue a thorough review of the European Union &apos;s Lisbon Treaty , not just to strengthen the ECB and monetary policy , but with respect to all pending institutional reforms . 
The German court &apos;s ruling jeopardizes the ECB &apos;s ability to act as an effective lender of last resort , thereby reducing its independence and ultimately undermining its ability to deal with market panics and crises - and thus to fulfil its primary mandate of price stability . 
The ruling makes it more urgent than ever that European governments establish a viable and effective banking union and strengthen the ESM as a backstop for countries in crisis .
