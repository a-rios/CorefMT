The G-20 &quot; s Next Test 
BRUSSELS - The G-20 meetings this month , first in Busan , South Korea for finance ministers , and later this month in Toronto for heads of government , mark the moment when the major players in the world economy shift gear from budgetary stimulus to retrenchment . 
Not everyone is in agreement about this . 
Before the Busan meeting , United States Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner warned against &quot; a generalized , undifferentiated move to pull forward consolidation plans , &quot; and emphasized the need to &quot; proceed in step with the strengthening of the private-sector recovery . &quot; 
But the other finance ministers did not echo Geithner &apos;s warnings . 
Instead , they emphasized the &quot; importance of sustainable public finances &quot; and the need for &quot; measures to deliver fiscal sustainability . &quot; 
Gone is the stress on cautious , gradually phased-in exit strategies ; the search for a rebalancing was almost unnoticeable in the meeting &apos;s communiqué . 
This change affects Europe first and foremost . 
Shortly before the Busan meeting , the countries of southern Europe announced major consolidation efforts in the hope of soothing debt markets . 
Soon after this , British Prime Minister David Cameron announced &quot; years of pain ahead , &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel outlined a $ 100bn retrenchment plan , and French Prime Minister François Fillon a similar $ 80bn plan . . 
The advanced countries face a dismal budgetary situation , with deficits averaging 9 % of GDP in 2009 and the prospect of public-debt ratios rising from roughly 70 % of GDP prior to the crisis to more than 100 % of GDP in 2015 . 
According to IMF calculations , to reach a 60 % debt ratio in 2030 would require a budgetary adjustment of almost nine percentage points of GDP on average between 2010 and 2020 . 
While some countries in the past undertook adjustments of similar magnitude , a generalized consolidation of this sort is without precedent . 
How painful will the adjustment be ? 
In the past , some countries have enjoyed tearless consolidation , because the launch of a retrenchment program was accompanied by a drop in long-term interest rates , a decline in private savings , or a surge in exports thanks to exchange-rate depreciation ( or all of these at the same time ) . 
But conditions today are characterized by low interest rates and high private debt , so none of these are likely to help , except possibly for exchange-rate effects . 
Indeed , depreciation has already started for Europe , and many observers consider the euro &apos;s fall , from 1.5 dollars in late 2009 to 1.2 dollars in recent days , sufficient to offset in the short term the retrenchment &apos;s negative impact on growth . 
But this can work only as long as the US does not follow suit and continues to serve as consumer of last resort . 
This may not happen . 
Even if the US further postpones retrenchment , the US Congress is unlikely to tolerate an appreciation of the US dollar that makes European exporters more competitive and shifts the burden of sustaining the recovery onto US consumers . 
More importantly , increasingly nervous bond markets will at some point start questioning the sustainability of US public finances . 
The US fiscal position is no better than that of major European countries like Germany , France , or the United Kingdom ; in fact , it is worse . 
It is only because the EU is fragmented , so markets started off by questioning the solvency of the weakest countries within it , and because Europe does not benefit from a safe-haven effect that it was the first to suffer the pressure . 
Fortunately , the public-finance situation is entirely different in the developing world , which in some cases has been hit by capital-flow reversals stemming from the collapse of world trade , but does not face an internal adjustment challenge . 
While domestic credit booms may be a threat in the future , emerging-market banks have mostly remained immune from the fallout of the financial crisis . 
As a result , domestic non-financial sectors do not face the prospect of deleveraging . 
More importantly , the fiscal challenge for these economies is of much lower magnitude than in the advanced world ; in fact , it barely exists . 
The starting points are a 40 % public debt-to-GDP ratio and an average budget deficit that , as a share of GDP , is four percentage points lower than in the advanced world . 
Against the background of much faster potential growth , only a minor effort is needed to keep the debt ratio around the 40 % level . 
So , what if Europe and the US both enter a phase of prolonged budgetary adjustment while the emerging world stays on course ? 
What if the divergence between the North and South within the G-20 widens further ? 
Four consequences are likely . 
First , there will be a significant drag on world growth . 
Whatever the emerging world does to sustain domestic demand and reorient exports from advanced countries to other emerging countries , the European and US elephants ( not to mention Japan ) are just too big for their illness to have no effect on world growth . 
Second , the growth differential between emerging and advanced countries will widen , which will in turn intensify flows of capital and skilled labor towards the developing world . 
Third , the advanced countries will need monetary support , which implies low policy rates for years to come , while the monetary needs in the emerging and developing countries will be radically different . 
This will inevitably make fixed exchange-rate links crack under pressure as the same monetary policy cannot possibly be appropriate for both regions . 
Finally , instead of managing common challenges , as in 2009 , the G-20 members will need to manage their divergence . 
This will be a major test of resilience for an institution that demonstrated effectiveness in the crisis but still has to pass the test posed by this new phase in the global economy . 
The Toronto summit will provide a first opportunity to assess the G-20 &quot; s ability to adapt to new conditions .
