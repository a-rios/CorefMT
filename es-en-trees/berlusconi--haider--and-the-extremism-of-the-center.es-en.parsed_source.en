Berlusconi , Haider , and the Extremism of the Center 
BUDAPEST : First Haider , now Berlusconi . 
Along with Bavaria &apos;s provincial government ( provincial in more senses than one ) , it has been the strongest foreign supporter of Jörg Haider &apos;s movement . 
Viktor Orban &apos;s government here , besides other misdeeds , attempts to suppress parliamentary government , penalize local governments controlled by its opponents , and is creating a novel state ideology in cahoots with a group of lumpen right-wing intellectuals . 
A video from 1988 shows Orban protecting me with his body from the truncheons of communist riot police . Ten years later , Orban appointed a communist police general as his home secretary . 
Political conflicts between friends are usually acrimonious and this is no exception . 
Our opponents - in personal terms - are too close for comfort . 
Orban , Haider , and Berlusconi represent a new politics of exclusion that has found a comfortable niche in today &apos;s global capitalism . 
The old politics of exclusion was Fascism ; this new post-fascism is very different : it lacks a Führer , one-party rule , or an SS . 
Yet it shares a crucial feature with Fascism : it seeks to reverse the great Enlightenment idea that linked citizenship to the human condition . 
By equating citizenship with human dignity , the Enlightenment extended it - at least in principle - to all classes , professions , sexes , races , and creeds . 
The state was conceived as representing everyone ; as such , citizenship ceased to be a feudal privilege for the few and became a universal ideal , delivering virtual equality in political conditions . 
The Fascism of the first half of the 20th century attacked the notion of universal citizenship , but not in the name of conservatism . 
For although Fascism was counter-revolutionary , it did not seek to re-establish hereditary aristocracy . 
Nonetheless , it obliterated the universal citizenship within which the nation-state represented and protected everyone inside its borders . 
Under Fascism , the sovereign power determined who did and did not belong to the civic community . 
The Fascist idea of denying citizenship through exploitation , oppression , discrimination or even annihilation is being replaced nowadays by a new form of exclusion . 
The new politics of exclusion - what I call post-fascism - does not need storm-troopers and dictators . 
Freedom , security , and prosperity , indeed , are left undisturbed , at least for that productive majority living in rich countries . 
But the idea of citizenship here is akin to what existed before the Enlightenment : citizenship becomes again a grant from the sovereign , not a universal human right . 
These new politicians of exclusion represent a striking phenomenon of the turn of the millennium : an extremism of the center . 
How can you have an extremism of the center ? 
Before communism collapsed , the old bourgeois world was permanently confronted by strong competitors to the right and left . 
Both of those antagonists vanished ten years ago , leaving capitalism as the sole force on the political horizon . 
In such a world , dissent is pointless , because anti-capitalist politics is taken seriously by very few . 
As a result , political repression is unnecessary and exclusion can be accomplished from the center . 
Citizenship itself is increasingly defined in apolitical terms . 
Interest groups and other voluntary associations - the touchstones of the much-lauded &quot; civil society &quot; - cannibalize politics and citizenship increasingly becomes a matter of policy , not politics . 
Haider , Berlusconi , and Orban are prime examples of this . 
Their discourse is partly libertarian / neo-liberal . 
They strongly favor shareholding and home-ownership , and are mostly free of the old Fascism &apos;s romantic-reactionary nationalism , as distinct from the new parochial selfishness and racism . 
They seek to achieve their goals though a &quot; soft &quot; exclusion of borders , immigration laws , neglect , and the movement of capital . 
In the old days universal citizenship resulted from liberation struggles and efforts at exclusion were used to suppress these insurrections . 
Such struggles are impossible to imagine for today &apos;s wretched of the earth because no one exploits them . 
No extra profit or surplus value is being extracted . 
Instead , the poor have become superfluous . 
Far from abusing those on the periphery , the center ( i.e. , the majorities within rich countries ) focus on keeping the poor at bay . 
Awesome frontier barriers are erected . 
Humanitarian wars are fought in order to prevent masses of refugees from flowing in and cluttering up Western welfare systems . 
Abetting this extremism of the center is the international economic system . 
Fights for higher salaries and better working conditions are met nowadays , not by violence and strikebreakers , but by capital flight and rebukes from the IMF . 
Only one exit - exodus - remains for the poor and it is the exclusionists &quot; job to prevent their taking it . 
The attacks on the underclass which follow - on both the global poor and domestic ne &apos;er-do-wells - provide post-fascism with populist energy . 
Citizenship in a functioning Western state is the one safe meal ticket in the modern world . 
Today , however , it is becoming the privilege of the few . 
Post-fascists need not put non-citizens into freight trains ; they only need to prevent them from boarding any train that might bring them to the West . 
Of course , post-fascist ideas are not unique to Austria , Italy , and Hungary . 
They exist throughout Europe &apos;s anti-immigrant movements . 
Extremism of the center may not threaten liberal democratic rule , but is incompatible with the Enlightenment idea of universal citizenship . 
For the threat posed by post-fascism is not that of incipient authoritarianism , but of a politics that reserves the benefits of citizenship to the few .
