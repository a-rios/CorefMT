Osama bin Laden &apos;s Pakistan 
NEW DELHI - The killing of Osama bin Laden by United States special forces in a helicopter assault on a sprawling luxury mansion near Islamabad recalls the capture of other Al Qaeda leaders in Pakistani cities . 
Once again , we see that the real terrorist sanctuaries are located not along Pakistan &apos;s borders with Afghanistan and India , but in the Pakistani heartland . 
This , in turn , underlines another fundamental reality - that the fight against international terrorism cannot be won without demilitarizing and de-radicalizing Pakistan , including by rebalancing civil-military relations there and reining in the country &apos;s rogue Inter-Services Intelligence agency . 
Other terrorist leaders captured in Pakistan since 9 / 11 - including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Al Qaeda &apos;s third in command ; 
Abu Zubeida , the network &apos;s operations chief ; 
Yasser Jazeeri ; 
Abu Faraj Farj ; and Ramzi Binalshibh , one of the coordinators of 9 / 11 - were also found living in cities across Pakistan . 
If there is any surprise about bin Laden &apos;s hideout , it is its location in a military town , Abbottabad , in the shadow of an army academy . 
This only underscores the major protection that bin Laden must have received from elements of the Pakistani security establishment to help him elude the US dragnet for nearly a decade . 
The breakthrough in hunting him down came only after the US , even at the risk of rupturing its longstanding ties with the Pakistani army and ISI , deployed a number of CIA operatives , Special Operations forces , and contractors deep inside Pakistan without the knowledge of the Pakistani military . 
In recent years , with its senior operations men captured or killed and bin Laden holed up in Pakistan , the badly splintered Al Qaeda had already lost the ability to mount a major international attack or openly challenge US interests . 
Yet its dangerous ideology is expected to live on and motivate state-sponsored non-state actors . 
It will be mainly such elements that will have the capacity to launch major transnational terrorist attacks , like the 2008 Mumbai strikes . 
Even in Afghanistan , the US military &apos;s main foe is not Al Qaeda but a resurgent Taliban , which enjoys safe haven in Pakistan . 
That is why the spotlight is likely to turn on the terrorist nexus within Pakistan and the role of , and relationship between , state and non-state actors there . 
Significantly , as the CIA closed in on bin Laden , the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , for the first time publicly linked the Pakistani military with some of the militants attacking US forces in Afghanistan . 
Pakistan &apos;s homegrown Islamist militias continue to operate openly , and the Pakistani army and intelligence remain loath to sever their cozy ties with extremist and terrorist elements . 
For the US , Pakistan poses a particularly difficult challenge . 
Despite providing $ 20 billion to Pakistan in counterterrorism aid since 9 / 11 , the US has received grudging assistance , at best , and duplicitous cooperation , at worst . 
Today , amid a rising tide of anti-Americanism , US policy on Pakistan is rapidly unraveling . 
Yet Pakistan , with one of the world &apos;s lowest tax-to-GDP ratios , has become more dependent than ever on US aid . 
Even as Americans exult over bin Laden &apos;s killing , the US government must recognize that its failed policy on Pakistan has inadvertently made that country the world &apos;s main terrorist sanctuary . 
Rather than helping to build robust civilian institutions there , the US has pampered the jihadist-penetrated Pakistani military establishment , best illustrated by the fresh $ 3 billion military aid package earmarked for the next fiscal year . 
After dictator Pervez Musharraf was driven out of office , the new Pakistani civilian government ordered the ISI to report to the interior ministry , but received no support from the US for this effort to assert civilian control , allowing the army to quickly frustrate the effort . 
After coming to office , US President Barack Obama implemented a military surge in Afghanistan . 
In Pakistan , however , he implemented an aid surge , turning it into the largest recipient of US aid , even though the Afghan Taliban leadership and Al Qaeda remnants remained ensconced in the country . 
This only deepened US involvement in the wrong war and emboldened Pakistan to fatten the Afghan Taliban , even as sustained US attacks continued to severely weaken Al Qaeda . 
Make no mistake : the scourge of Pakistani terrorism emanates more from the country &apos;s Scotch whisky-sipping generals than from the bead-rubbing mullahs . 
It is the self-styled secular generals who have reared the forces of jihad and fathered the Taliban , Lashkar-e-Taiba , Jalaluddin Haqqani militia , and other groups . 
Yet , by passing the blame for their ongoing terrorist-proxy policy to their mullah puppets , the generals have made the US believe that the key is to contain the religious fringe , not the puppeteers . 
In fact , Pakistan &apos;s descent into a jihadist dungeon occurred not under civilian rule , but under two military dictators - one who nurtured and let loose jihadist forces , and another who took his country to the very edge of the precipice . 
Without reform of the Pakistani army and ISI , there can be no end to transnational terrorism - and no genuine nation-building in Pakistan . 
How can Pakistan be a &quot; normal &quot; state if its army and intelligence agency remain outside civilian oversight and decisive power remains with military generals ? 
With bin Laden dead , the only way that Al Qaeda can reconstitute itself is if the Pakistani military succeeds in reinstalling a proxy regime in Afghanistan . 
Until the Pakistani military &apos;s vise-like grip on power is broken and the ISI cut down to size , Pakistan is likely to remain Ground Zero for the terrorist threat that the world confronts .
