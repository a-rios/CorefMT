An Alliance of Equals 
PARIS - During NATO &apos;s recent 60th anniversary ceremony in Strasbourg , the Alliance welcomed two new members , Albania and Croatia , bringing its total membership to 28 . 
This expansion is a good thing , for history has tormented these two countries . 
Being welcomed within the great international family of the West will reassure them , stabilize them , and contribute to their political , cultural , and economic development . 
But the good news was limited , because NATO addressed only a routine agenda . 
No core problem was really tackled . 
The controversy that arose in France over the country &apos;s return to NATO &apos;s unified military command makes this abundantly clear . 
Was France losing its autonomy , perhaps even its sovereignty ? 
Was it capitulating to American hegemony ? 
These are real questions , yet at the NATO summit people spoke of them more in terms of symbols than as realities . 
But what is the reality here ? 
NATO is a military alliance composed of 28 countries . 
One of them , the United States , has a military budget that is more than three times that of all the other members combined . 
Hence , the US runs most NATO civilian and military commands with the consent of the others . 
Of course , there is a collective consultation and deliberative process that enables any member to be heard . 
But in reality a member &apos;s actual power is what affects common decisions . 
This structure harks back to the conditions of NATO &apos;s birth , when it was forged to thwart the Soviet threat to Western civilization . 
At the time , no one ever doubted that American power - already endowed with nuclear weapons - was the only counterpart . 
For this reason , the US came to preside over the alliance . 
During the 41 years of the Cold War , 14 of NATO &apos;s 16 members strictly obeyed and complied with American decisions and policies . 
French President Charles de Gaulle was the only one to question whether an American president would actually ever be ready to launch a nuclear attack on the USSR in order to protect one or several Alliance members if vital US interests were not directly at stake . 
Based on that doubt , France - a nuclear power since 1960 - withdrew in 1966 from the Alliance &apos;s permanent centralized military command in order to assert its own deterrent capability . 
This decision was mainly grounded on the American doctrine , adopted in 1962 , of &quot; flexible response , &quot; which said to the Soviets : &quot; As long as you do not use nuclear weapons , we will not use them , either . &quot; 
This very doctrine left Europe exposed . 
Indeed , while it is a much disputed question , de Gaulle was probably right about America &apos;s lack of commitment to the nuclear defense of Europe . 
Both Henry Kissinger and Robert McNamara left office admitting that de Gaulle had been correct . 
Nevertheless , de Gaulle &apos;s insights left a legacy that still causes some mistrust and dissent within NATO . 
France was right on this key strategic point , but it was never able to explain its position to its allies . 
This inability to discuss , clearly and forthrightly , this strategic doctrine continues to hamper the Alliance . 
At the Strasbourg summit , confidence in the future could have been strengthened if a couple of troubling issues had been discussed . 
Instead , once again , there was an extended focus on the past . 
The key questions are whether NATO &apos;s doctrine of common defense is currently directed at one country in particular , and whether nuclear force remains the Alliance &apos;s major defensive tool . 
In the current global situation , no predictable conflict will require the use of a nuclear weapon . 
At the moment , there is no global threat and the Alliance only intervenes in regional conflicts , so why not have NATO admit this ? 
But the most important matter that went unmentioned in Strasbourg is the relationship with Russia . 
NATO was founded to confront the threat that the USSR represented 60 years ago . 
But the Warsaw Pact , the Soviet Union &apos;s &quot; anti-NATO &quot; alliance of socialist countries , was dissolved in 1991 ; communism imploded the same year , with Russia caught ever since in a struggle to build a market economy and define a new global position for itself . 
At a time when Russia was taking a more pacific course , NATO - unlike the Warsaw Pact - was not dismantled . 
On the contrary , the Allies chose to maintain the pact and to extend it to numerous Russian neighbors . 
NATO &apos;s members essentially said : &quot; We Western nations do not trust you . 
Even if you become a democracy , we will always be suspicious . &quot; 
George Kennan , one of the greatest American diplomats of the post-war years , once wrote that the Western world was committing its biggest mistake in 50 years time by expanding NATO after Soviet communism collapsed . 
The resulting humiliation and blatant mistrust that Russia &apos;s elite has felt ever since has led them to their current policy of rearmament . 
The only way to resolve this problem is for NATO to assert its pacific intentions before the world . 
The most convincing way to do that is to moderate America &apos;s excessive taste for power , which it demonstrated in Iraq . 
NATO needs to shift its focus from organizing and administering a unified military command to building real confidence that every member &apos;s voice will be heard . 
To that end , all members must stand on an equal footing . 
France &apos;s decision to return to full and equal Alliance membership was a good one , and France must now work from within to advance the principles in which it believes .
