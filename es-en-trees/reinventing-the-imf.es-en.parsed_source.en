Reinventing the IMF

But recently confidence recently has been shaken : by soaring oil prices , natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina , and growing global imbalances - large surpluses in some countries offset by large deficits in others . 
How these problems can all affect individual countries as well as the world economy shows the reality of globalization . 
Indeed , to balance the enormous potential benefits and dangers of an increasingly integrated world economy , governments need new tools and a deeper understanding of the forces at work . 
The challenges are even greater for the poorer developing countries : they need to plug into the global economy to narrow the gap with the rest of the world and bring concrete benefits to their poorest citizens . 
The International Monetary Fund was established after World War II to help countries avoid the errors ion economic policy that helped bring on that conflagration . 
Over the past 60 years , the Fund &apos;s responsibilities have grown as the world economy has been transformed . 
When I joined the Fund a little over a year ago , it was clear that our member countries &quot; demands on the Fund were still intensifying . 
Consequently , I launched a study of the institution &apos;s role in the world economy and how it will have to change . 
The result is a medium-term strategy that &#91; will be presented in the coming days &#93; to the IMF-World Bank Annual Meeting in Washington , D.C. 
Our analysis shows that as globalization continues its rapid evolution , new challenges emerge . 
The size , speed and reach of shocks across mature and emerging-market countries has have increased . 
TAnd the difficulties and new realities associated with the integration of markets have been amplified , as evidenced by the current dispute surrounding trade in textileswhere global integration brings different interests into conflictand the contradictory interests that are at play due to global integration . 
All of this means that the IMF itself must continue to adapt . 
Of course , the Fund has long been deeply involved in addressing the reforms required by globalization - and it has made a difference . 
Much of thework since the mid-1990 &quot; s has been driven by the challenges of massive cross-border capital flows . 
But these responsibilities have proliferated rapidly , absorbing resources and not always meeting the needs of Fundthe membership in the most efficient fashion . 
What is necessary now is to refocus the IMF &apos;s priorities to help countries meet the new challenges of globalization , be it through the development of better budgetary and monetary frameworks , reforms to adapt to rising trade , or the strengthening of financial systems . 
The refocusing must center on the way the Fund analyzes economic trends on a global , regional and single-country basis , and then how it provides advice . 
This work - which the IMF calls surveillance - needs to move from an all-encompassing approach to a more incisive analysis of specific weaknesses and distortions that create the risk of crises or hinder adjustment to globalizationtheintegration into the global economy . 
It also requires the Fund to become more engaged in the policy debates that shape public opinion and policy choices . 
At the global level , the Fund can contribute to a better understanding of globalization by offering more in-depth analysis of crucial trends , especially in financial markets . 
The IMF - as a universal institution - offers a unique forum for seeking cooperative solutions to key issues ; for example , addressing and understanding current and future global economic imbalances . 
In an era in which regional economic integration has become increasingly important , it is essential that the Fund focus more on overall trends in individual regions , and for it to encourage steps to enhance regional cooperation . 
Ultimately , it is the Fund &apos;s interaction with each member country that is most crucial to the work of identifying economic vulnerabilities and ensuring long-term , stable growth . 
In order to provide the most useful advice and analysis to each government - and , when needed , tailor the necessary financing - our economists need to address the most pressing economic issues . 
In advanced countries , there must be a stronger focus on the global implications of economic policies and on ways to make IMF advice more persuasive . 
In emerging markets , the central concern should be improving early warning systems , reviewing how best to resolve crises , and considering the possible role of Fund financing in crisis prevention . 
IAnd in the low-income countries , the poverty-reduction effort should focus on the Fund &apos;s core areas of macroeconomic expertise ; find ways to introduce greater flexibility in Fund lending instruments ; assess the achievability of the U.N. Millennium Development Goals ; help both donors and recipient countries to increase aid and its efficiency ; and streamline procedures to make interaction with the IMF more effective . 
TRegarding insight , the IMF as an international public institution should seek for itself the best standards of transparency and accountability . 
We are already a very open organization , within which whereose all our decisions and analyses are all made public . , b But our own decision-making process has to be updated to reflect - in our quotascountries &quot; capital shares and voting power - 21st century the realityies of the role of countries in today &apos;s world . 
As we address the challenges of our rapidly globalizing world , further evolution is essential . 
Future crises will almost certainly be different from previous ones . 
The IMF needs to be ready , and flexible enough , to help the world face the unpredictable .
