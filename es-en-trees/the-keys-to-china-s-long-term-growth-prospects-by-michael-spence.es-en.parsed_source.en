China &apos;s End of Exuberance 
MILAN - China &apos;s growth has slowed considerably since 2010 , and it may slow even more - a prospect that is rattling investors and markets well beyond China &apos;s borders . 
With many of the global economy &apos;s traditional growth engines - like the United States - stuck in low gear , China &apos;s performance has become increasingly important . 
But now growth rates for Chinese exports and related indices in manufacturing have fallen , largely owing to weak external demand , especially in Europe . 
And the Chinese authorities are now scaling back the other major driver of their country &apos;s growth , public-sector investment , as low-return projects seem to generate aggregate demand but prove unsustainable fairly quickly . 
The government is using a variety of instruments , including financial-sector credit discipline , to rein in investment demand . 
Essentially , the government guarantee associated with financing public-sector investment is being withdrawn - as it should be . 
But , to circumvent the restrictions in the state-dominated financial system , a shadow banking system has developed , raising new risks : economic distortions ; reliance on excess leverage to drive growth in the consumer , real estate , corporate , and government sectors ; and dangers associated with inadequate regulation . 
As a result , investors are worried that China could slip into the excess-leverage growth model that has served many developed economies so poorly . 
Much has been made of domestic consumption as a driver of Chinese growth in the future . 
But Justin Lin , a former World Bank chief economist , has argued forcefully that investment will and should remain a key growth driver , and that domestic consumption in China &apos;s growth pattern should not be pushed beyond its natural limits into a high-leverage model based on rising consumer debt . 
That seems right . 
The risk is that Lin &apos;s warning will be interpreted as an argument for sticking with an investment-led model , which would imply more low-return public-sector projects and excess capacity in selected industries . 
The right target for generating growth is domestic aggregate demand based on the right mix of consumption and high-return investment . 
Analysts and investors have at least two related concerns . 
One is that , facing declining growth , policymakers will resort to excess investment or leverage ( or both ) , creating instability . 
The other is that they will resort to neither , and that no alternative growth engines will have been started , leading to an extended slowdown with unpredictable political consequences at home and serious economic consequences abroad . 
In short , many investors are nervous because China &apos;s future growth story is unclear to them . 
It is certainly less clear than the previous story , which cannot be retold . 
There is no real way to allay these concerns quickly . 
Only time , implementation of the policy and systemic reforms to be revealed this fall , and actual economic performance will settle the matter one way or the other . 
The shift in the growth pattern , if successful , will occur over several years . 
So , what one should be looking for is movement in the right directions , which are fairly clear . 
One is a shift in comparative advantage . 
Rising incomes require rising productivity . 
That means increasing capital and human capital intensity across both the tradable and non-tradable sectors of the economy . 
On the tradable side , one should look for structural change and a shift in output to higher-value-added components of global supply chains . 
Here , innovation and the conditions that support it - including competition and free entry and exit from the market - play an important role . 
If policymakers choose a model based on a large state-dominated sector protected from internal and external competition , innovation objectives are unlikely to be met , adversely affecting future growth . 
Meanwhile , the non-tradable side should grow . 
As China becomes richer , its middle-class citizens will not just buy more tradable goods like cars , electronics , and appliances ; they will buy housing and a host of non-tradable services , too . 
An efficient supply-side response to this large and growing source of demand requires regulatory reform in many services , including finance , product safety , transport , and logistics . 
But households still control too little income and save at very high rates . 
The control of income by the overlapping corporate and public sectors makes it easier to push the investment-led growth model to the point of low ( or even negative ) returns . 
So the entire fiscal system is a crucial item on China &apos;s reform agenda , especially management of public capital . 
Fiscal reform will determine many things : the components of domestic income and demand that will drive structural change on the supply side , the allocation of income and expenditure across levels of government , and the embedded incentives that this allocation implies . 
Outside of China , this part of the reform agenda is the least well understood . 
Moreover , social services and social security will need to be strengthened in order to reverse a pattern of rising inequality . 
Beyond that , more inclusive growth depends on the completion of the urbanization process that underpins the creation of a modern economy ; addressing corruption and unequal access to market opportunities ; and aggressively mitigating well-known and serious environmental problems . 
With significant elements of the global economy and external demand facing headwinds , China &apos;s acceptance ( so far ) of a growth slowdown , while its new growth engines kick in , is a good sign , in my view . 
It suggests that policymakers are playing for longer-run sustainable growth and have become warier of policies that , if used persistently , amount to a defective , unsustainable growth model . 
Watching for progress on these key elements of structural change and reform seems to be the right stance . 
If markets are confused or pessimistic about China &apos;s longer-term agenda , but if the direction of structural change and reform is positive , there may be investment opportunities that were absent in the more exuberant recent past .
