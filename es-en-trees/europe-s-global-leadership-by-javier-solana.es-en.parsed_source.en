A Europe for the World 
MADRID - Despite the welter of economic problems surrounding Europe , one fact should not be forgotten : the European Union remains the world &apos;s largest economy . 
With a GDP of more than â‚¬ 15.5 trillion , it is larger than that of the United States . 
And , with 20 % of world trade , the EU is also the world &apos;s second-largest exporter and importer , after China and the US , respectively . 
But this data cannot hide the fact that the institutional model that made today &apos;s integrated Europe possible is inadequate to the problems created by the financial crisis . 
So we Europeans need to deepen European integration with much greater determination and speed . 
If we do not , there is a real risk that social discontent will undermine the EU &apos;s foundations before we can complete the process of integration that will resolve the problems now blighting the lives of millions of people . 
Moreover , these problems cannot be separated from the way in which the Union - now the main focus of the world &apos;s economic concerns - presents itself to the world . 
Europe will need to bet on greater integration in order to escape this predicament . 
And , unavoidably , integration will lead to a united , coherent , and effective European foreign policy , one that is adapted to a world that is changing at dizzying speed . 
Today &apos;s world is already multipolar . 
But multi-polarity provides no guarantee that the international system will be capable of being governed by common rules , without which global affairs will become much more dangerous and conflict-ridden . 
It is still the leader in institutional innovation - one of this century &apos;s greatest needs - and is the best and most successful historical example of it , as its Nobel Peace Prize for 2012 acknowledged . 
Other parts of the world are experiencing unprecedented economic growth , but that raises another great challenge : the need to build on the foundations of this growth a fairer political system and open , inclusive societies that respect human rights and the environment . 
Fortunately , European countries are not the only ones sharing sovereignty nowadays . 
A good example is the work being done by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , which is taking bold steps in a part of the world where integration has never been the norm and clear regional security structures are lacking . 
Europe must act to buttress these integrative steps . 
It is precisely this region , the Asia / Pacific , that is bound to be the focus of international relations in both the medium and the long term . 
The US has already announced its strategic reorientation to Asia . 
Moreover , the region is home to numerous longstanding quarrels , territorial and border disputes , rampant nationalism , and considerable mistrust . 
China does not want to see a twenty-first century dominated by a G-2 in which it finds itself alone with the US . 
It would prefer a G-3 , at least , that includes the EU . 
So , in addition to the good relations that the EU maintains with both powers , the Union &apos;s experience in multilateral problem solving could be invaluable . 
One theme addressed at the Munich Security Conference last February - and that should be included in any approach to Asia - is that the region &apos;s extraordinary economic growth has hidden its security problems . 
But this does not mean that those problems are bound to remain submerged , as the recent escalation of territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas has demonstrated . 
Turning to Europe &apos;s own neighborhood , the EU &apos;s unipolar moment of the 1990 &quot; s has come to an end . 
Russia has not moved any closer to European standards ; 
Yet soft power and the model of multilateral dialogue are still the way to achieve political , economic , and energy cooperation , thereby ensuring a prosperous neighborhood that includes these countries and those to the east . 
Relations with the Americas are different in nature . 
Here , proximity is not physical , but rather based on shared values and vision . 
In a constantly changing and complex world , coordinated action with the US must continue and progress . 
Moreover , impartial observers recognize that Latin America will be one of the great beneficiaries of the twenty-first century , and that closer relations between the two continents should be a key goal for both . 
The EU has taken steps in the right direction , such as the creation of the European External Action Service under the Lisbon Treaty . 
My own personal experience tells me that where an ambassador of the EEAS is at work , the EU &apos;s influence grows . 
As the EU aspires to become an international power , the choice is simple : either we Europeans act in unity to confront the tremendous challenges presented by the tumultuous changes now underway in the world order , or we doom ourselves to act as spectators in a world in which we have little or no say . 
Our prosperity and the viability of our socioeconomic model are at stake .
