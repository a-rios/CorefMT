Responsibly Destroying the World &apos;s Peasantry 
BRUSSELS - The World Bank , the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) , the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( IFAD ) , and the UN Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) Secretariat recently presented seven &quot; Principles for Responsible Agricultural Investment . &quot; 
The principles seek to ensure that large-scale land investments result in &quot; win-win &quot; situations , benefiting investors and directly affected communities alike . 
It has been several years since private investors and states began buying and leasing millions of hectares of farmland worldwide in order to secure their domestic supply of food , raw commodities , and biofuels , or to get subsidies for carbon storage through plantations . 
Western investors , including Wall Street banks and hedge funds , now view direct investments in land as a safe haven in an otherwise turbulent financial climate . 
The scope of the phenomenon is enormous . 
Since 2006 , between 15 and 20 million hectares of farmland , the equivalent of the total arable surface of France , have been the subject of negotiations by foreign investors . 
The risks are considerable . 
All too often , notions such as &quot; reserve agricultural land , &quot; or &quot; idle land , &quot; are manipulated out of existence , sometimes being used to designate land on which many livelihoods depend , and that is subject to long-standing customary rights . 
The requirement that evictions take place only for a valid &quot; public purpose , &quot; with fair compensation , and following consultation of those affected , is honored more in the breach than in the observance . 
In Africa , rural land is generally considered to be state-owned , and is treated by governments as if it were their own . 
In Latin America , the gap between large landowners and small peasants is widening . 
In South Asia , many populations are currently being driven off their ancestral land to make room for large palm-oil plantations , special economic zones , or re-forestation projects . 
The set of principles that have been proposed to discipline the phenomenon remain purely voluntary . 
Because the principles ignore human rights , they neglect the essential dimension of accountability . 
There is also a clear tension between ceding land to investors for the creation of large plantations , and the objective of redistributing land and ensuring more equitable access to it . 
Governments have repeatedly committed themselves to these goals , most recently at the 2006 International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development . 
The underlying problem runs deeper than how the principles have been formulated . 
The promotion of large-scale land investment is based on the belief that combating hunger requires boosting food production , and that supply has been lagging because of a lack of investment in agriculture . 
Hence , if investment can be attracted to agriculture , it should be welcomed , and whichever rules are imposed should encourage it , not deter it . 
But both the diagnosis and the remedy are incorrect . 
Hunger and malnutrition are not primarily the result of insufficient food production ; they are the result of poverty and inequality , particularly in rural areas , where 75 % of the world &apos;s poor still reside . 
In the past , agricultural development has prioritized large-scale , capitalized forms of agriculture , neglecting smallholders who feed local communities . 
It should come as no wonder that smallholders and agricultural laborers represent a combined 70 % of those who are unable to feed themselves today . 
Accelerating the shift towards large-scale , highly mechanized forms of agriculture will not solve the problem . 
Indeed , it will make it worse . 
The largest and best-equipped farms are highly competitive , in the sense that they can produce for markets at a lower cost . 
Smallholders , by contrast , produce at a higher cost . 
They are often very productive by hectare , since they maximize the use of the soil , and achieve the best complementary use of plants and animals . 
If smallholders compete in the same markets as the large farms , they lose . 
Yet they render invaluable services , in terms of preservation of agro- and biodiversity , local communities &quot; resilience to price shocks or weather-related events , and environmental conservation . 
The arrival of large-scale investment in agriculture will alter the relationship between these worlds of farming . 
It will exacerbate highly unequal competition . 
Certainly , agricultural investment should develop responsibly . 
To re-launch agriculture in the developing world would require an estimated $ 30 billion per year , representing 0.05 % of global GDP . 
By supporting further consolidation of large-scale monocultures in the hands of the most powerful economic actors , we risk widening further the gap with small-scale , family farming , while pushing a model of industrial farming that is already responsible for one-third of man-made greenhouse-gas emissions today . 
It is regrettable that , instead of rising to the challenge of developing agriculture in a way that is more socially and environmentally sustainable , we act as if accelerating the destruction of the global peasantry could be accomplished responsibly .
