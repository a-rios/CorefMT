Can East Asians Cooperate ? 
SEOUL - As China continues its unremitting rise , people throughout East Asia are wondering whether their states will ever be able to achieve the peaceful , stable relations that now characterize Europe . 
Given the regularity of serious diplomatic spats - over everything from tiny atolls in the South China Sea to the legacy of World War II - this may sound like an elusive dream . 
But , with nationalism and military budgets rising sharply , achieving consensual stability has become imperative for the region . 
Can it be done ? 
The &quot; liberal &quot; view of international relations recommends three ingredients : political democratization , deeper economic interdependence , and viable institutions through which East Asia &apos;s states can conduct their affairs in a multilateral way . 
Because , as Immanuel Kant noted long ago , states with democratic political systems tend not to fight with each other , democracy should be encouraged in order to secure peace . 
Pursuit of a Pax Democratia has long been embedded in American foreign policymaking . 
And European states have , since 1945 , made democracy a core element in their integration . 
But East Asia &apos;s wide variety of political systems makes such a democratic consensus highly unlikely , at least for now . 
On the other hand , economic interdependence among East Asia &apos;s states has been deepening . 
For 30 years , East Asians have received the ample rewards of Adam Smith &apos;s insight that free trade would bring material benefits to participating countries . 
Regional policymakers nowadays are loath to risk this progress through hostile behavior . 
Economic interdependence in East Asia gained momentum following the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 . 
But confrontations between the United States and China , the US and Japan , and China and Japan over the past year have left many wondering whether economic interdependence alone can bring about stable regional relations . 
The third liberal route to peace - institutionalizing international relations - aims to regularize the behavior of states through a system of norms and rules , thereby creating order ( and peace ) out of quasi-anarchy . 
Such thinking motivated US President Woodrow Wilson &apos;s desire to establish the League of Nations after World War I , and it also underlay President Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s push to create the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions after World War II . 
Likewise , European states accept the common norms and rules of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , and are almost always prepared to be regulated by them . 
Indeed , the European Union is the fruit of a long , continuous effort to strengthen common norms and rules among European states . 
In contrast to Europe , East Asia is composed of states that are radically different in terms of their size , development , and political-economic systems . 
East Asian policymakers understand that there is little that they can do to alter their neighbors &quot; political systems . 
Nor can they do much in an official way to deepen economic interdependence in the short term . 
So it is natural for the region &apos;s policymakers to focus more on institutionalization , with lively discussions regularly taking place about the region &apos;s nascent constellation of groupings : ASEAN + 3 , the East Asian Summit , the East Asian Community , Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation , Asia-Pacific Community , etc . 
But this process has been politicized and ridden by an acute behind-the-scenes competition for influence among the major powers . 
Indeed , East Asia seems to lack the equivalent of major EU architects like Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman - visionaries with the stature and political support needed to begin building a framework for regional peace in a time , like today , of great change . 
So , for now , East Asians should be very pragmatic about institutionalizing regional affairs . 
Rather than spending energy on trying to build large-scale institutions covering the entire region , it would be better to focus more on smaller , issue-oriented institutions . 
For example , the first successful step toward regional economic cooperation in East Asia was the Chiang Mai Initiative for international currency swaps , which followed the 1997-1998 crisis . 
Similarly , the Six-Party Talks on the denuclearization of North Korea , though producing no significant results so far , remain the only useful mechanism for addressing the problem collectively . 
The nuclear disaster in Fukushima , Japan , could give rise to another issue-specific regional institution , this one focused on nuclear safety . 
For Japan &apos;s neighbors , the International Atomic Energy Agency is not enough ; their urgent worries are creating pressure to establish a regional mechanism . 
The coming summit between South Korea , China , and Japan on May 21-22 in Tokyo , for example , will focus on nuclear safety and prepare a regime for closer regional cooperation . 
With 88 nuclear power plants currently operating in South Korea , Japan , and China , the initiative is an important one . 
What would happen if any of their reactors develops problems similar to those at Fukushima ? 
Moreover , North Korea has been running its Yongbyon nuclear facility without international inspection . 
According to the wife of a North Korean defector who worked for 20 years as a nuclear scientist at Yongbyon , safety standards there are dangerously lax . 
More broadly , only through the establishment of less ambitious , smaller-scale , and functionally oriented institutions can momentum be built for a regional framework for peace . 
After all , Rome wasn &apos;t built in a day , and the EU - rooted in the post-war European Coal and Steel Community - began with similar small steps toward integration .
