Japan &apos;s Accounting Problem 
TOKYO - Over the next few years , it will become obvious that the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) has monetized several trillion dollars of government debt . 
The result in Japan probably will be a small up-tick in inflation and growth . 
Japanese government debt now stands at more than 230 % of GDP , and at about 140 % even after deducting holdings by various government-related entities , such as the social-security fund . 
This debt mountain is the inevitable result of the large fiscal deficits that Japan has run since 1990 . 
And it is debt that will never be &quot; repaid &quot; in the normal sense of the word . 
Figures provided by the International Monetary Fund illustrate why . 
For Japan to pay down its net debt even to 80 % of GDP by 2030 , it would have to turn a 6 % -of-GDP primary budget deficit ( before interest payments on existing debt ) in 2014 into a 5.6 % -of-GDP surplus by 2020 , and maintain that surplus throughout the 2020s . 
If this was attempted , Japan would be condemned to sustained deflation and recession . 
Even a modest step in that direction - the sales-tax increase of April 2014 , for example - produced a severe setback to economic recovery . 
Instead of being repaid , the government &apos;s debt is being bought by the BOJ , whose purchases of ¥ 80 trillion per year now exceed the government &apos;s new debt issues of about ¥ 50 trillion . 
Total debt , net of BOJ holdings , is therefore falling slowly . 
Indeed , if current trends persist , the debt held neither by the BOJ nor other government-related entities could be down to 65 % of GDP by 2017 . 
And because the government owns the BOJ , which returns the interest it receives on government bonds to the government , it is only the declining net figure that represents a real liability for future Japanese taxpayers . 
The stated aim of the BOJ &apos;s giant quantitative easing operation is to raise asset prices , reduce interest rates , weaken the yen &apos;s exchange rate , and thus stimulate business investment and exports . 
These indirect transmission mechanisms are certainly having some positive impact on inflation and growth : private credit has turned positive since QE was launched . 
But the bigger economic stimulus derives from the government &apos;s continued large fiscal deficits , effectively funded with BOJ-created money . 
That reality is not yet openly admitted . 
The official doctrine is that the BOJ eventually will sell back all of the government bonds that it has acquired . 
But it need not do so . 
Indeed , the BOJ could maintain its current level of government-debt holdings indefinitely , making new purchases as existing bonds mature . 
And if the money created - in the form of commercial bank reserves at the BOJ - ever threatened to support excessive credit growth and inflation , the BOJ could offset that danger by imposing reserve requirements on the banks . 
The Japanese authorities are thus doing what former US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke proposed in 2003 - using monetized fiscal deficits to put spending power directly into the hands of companies and households . 
The BOJ rejected Bernanke &apos;s advice at the time , insisting instead that all deficits must be financed with bonds ; now , however , the BOJ is effectively monetizing past and current deficits alike . 
If it had done so earlier , Japan would have experienced less deflation and slightly higher growth , and would now have smaller public debts . 
But better late than never . 
The Japanese authorities could make their monetization explicit by replacing some of the interest-bearing debt held by the BOJ with a perpetual non-interest-bearing bond . 
But , regardless of whether they do so , the economic reality will become increasingly obvious over the next 2-3 years , and financial and political commentary will increasingly focus on the government &apos;s consolidated debt burden , net of central bank holdings . 
As that process plays out , there is a small risk that financial markets will be spooked by orthodox fears that monetization implies excessive inflation , and that large increases in government bond yields and dramatic yen depreciation will result . 
But the more probable market reaction will be a collective shrug of the shoulders , accepting permanent monetization as the only possible safe way to alleviate an otherwise intractable debt burden . 
Japan will end up having monetized , post facto , the large public deficits that it ran after the end of 1980s credit boom , and which usefully offset the impact of sustained private deleveraging in the 1990s and 2000s . 
Doing so earlier would have been better ; but , even without such radicalism Japan &apos;s &quot; lost decades &quot; were not quite as disastrous as is commonly assumed . 
Japan was already one the world &apos;s richest countries in 1990 , and its per capita income has continued to grow , albeit slowly . 
Its unemployment rate , now 3.6 % , has been consistently below European levels . 
And its &quot; public debt burden &quot; will turn out to be an illusion . 
It is the eurozone , not Japan , that should worry us . 
Tight constraints on fiscal deficits and an absolute prohibition on monetization by the European Central Bank have prevented an effective response to the post-2008 debt overhang , driving the eurozone unemployment rate to 11.2 % . 
The potential social and political consequences of lost decades of slow growth and high unemployment would be far more serious in Europe , with its diverse national identities and imperfectly integrated ethnic and religious minorities , than in culturally and ethnically homogeneous Japan . 
While Europe is playing with social and political fire , Japan simply needs to tweak its accounting entries . 
A shrug of the shoulders is well justified .
