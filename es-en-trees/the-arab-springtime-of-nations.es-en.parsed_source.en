The Arab Springtime of Nations ? 
JERUSALEM - Two things stand out in the Middle East since the Arab Spring began - one that happened , and one that did not . 
What happened was that for the first time in modern Arab history , authoritarian regimes and rulers were toppled , or seriously challenged , by popular demonstrations , not - as in the past - through military coups . 
But what did not happen might be as important as what did . 
While dictators associated with military juntas were challenged overnight , the Arab Spring never came to the region &apos;s conservative monarchies . 
The dynastic rulers of Morocco , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , and the Gulf states ( with the exception of Bahrain ) remain more or less firmly in the saddle , even though Saudi Arabia &apos;s regime , at least , is in many respects far more oppressive than were the former Egyptian and Tunisian regimes . 
Of course , oil money helps to sustain autocracy , but this is not a factor in Morocco and Jordan . 
It appears that these monarchies enjoy a form of traditional authority that the region &apos;s secular nationalist rulers never had . 
Being descendants of the Prophet , as in Morocco and Jordan , or having custodianship of the holy sites of Mecca and Medina , as in Saudi Arabia , bestows a legitimacy on the countries &quot; rulers that is directly linked to Islam . 
The only monarchical regime that was seriously challenged during the Arab Spring was the Sunni ruling family in Shia-majority Bahrain , where precisely this sectarian divide seems to have been the crucial ingredient in the uprising , which was then brutally suppressed with Saudi military help . 
Yet , for all of the success epitomized by the protests in Cairo &apos;s Tahrir Square , bringing down a dictatorship is one thing - a drama lasting a few weeks - while the transition to a functioning , consolidated democracy is quite another . 
Here , a lengthy process is involved , and its success - exemplified in the post-communist transitions in Eastern Europe - depends on key preconditions . 
Where these conditions exist - for example , a vibrant and autonomous civil society , as in Poland , or a strong pre-authoritarian tradition of pluralism , representation , and tolerance , as in the Czech Republic - the transition is relatively smooth . 
Where they are lacking or weak , as in Russia or Ukraine , the outcome is much more problematic . 
Simply put , a rosy outlook for countries like Egypt cannot be assumed on the basis of exhilarating images on CNN or Al Jazeera , or the fact that masses of young , well-educated , English-speaking men and women are connected through Facebook and Twitter . 
The great majority of Egyptians were not in Tahrir Square , and many of them lack not only access to online social networks , but also electricity and safe drinking water . 
Democracy and free speech are not at the top of their agenda . 
Egypt &apos;s silent majority also identifies with the authenticity represented by various Islamic groups , while principles of democracy and civil rights seem to them to be imported Western abstractions . 
So the tremendous victory of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Al-Nour Party in Egypt - as well as that of Ennahda in Tunisia - should come as no surprise . 
A similar scenario could unfold in Syria , if and when President Bashar al-Assad falls from power , while both post-Qaddafi Libya and post-Saleh Yemen point to the difficulties that these countries face in constructing a coherent democratic regime . 
Looking at Egypt &apos;s prospects realistically , one should not exclude the possibility that the two strongest forces in the country - the military and the Muslim Brotherhood - ultimately will find a way to share power . 
The Brotherhood &apos;s vision of democracy is purely majoritarian , not liberal : winning an election , according to its spokespeople , permits the victor to rule according to his views . 
Minority rights , institutional checks on government power , human rights - the liberal aspects of democracy - are entirely absent . 
Another , more fundamental , dimension to current and future changes in the region may come into view as well . 
Most international borders in the Middle East and North Africa were drawn by imperial powers - Britain , France , and Italy - either after World War I and the breakup of the Ottoman Empire ( the Sykes-Picot agreements ) , or , as in Libya and Sudan , earlier . 
But in no case did these borders correspond with local popular will , or with ethnic or historical boundaries . 
In other words , none of these countries , except Egypt , had ever been a discrete political entity . 
Until recently , their rulers had a common interest in keeping this Pandora &apos;s Box of borders tightly sealed . 
That has changed , and we see the region &apos;s imperially imposed frontiers being called into question . 
In Iraq , the emergence of a de facto Kurdish autonomous region in the north has put an end to Saddam Hussein &apos;s centralized Arab-controlled state . 
With South Sudan &apos;s independence , the rest of Arab-dominated Sudan could face further division , with Darfur leaving next . 
In Libya , the transitional authorities are finding it extremely challenging to create a coherent political structure that can unite two very different provinces , Cyrenaica and Tripolitania , which were held together only by the Qaddafi regime &apos;s brutality . 
In Benghazi , there are already calls for autonomy , if not outright independence . 
Similarly , Yemen &apos;s unity is far from assured . 
In a post-Assad Syria , the ethnic and religious fissures betweenSunnis , Alawites , Druze , Christians , and Kurdsmight equally threaten the country &apos;s unity . 
In his brutal way , Assad may be right that only his iron grip keeps the country together . 
And developments in Syria will undoubtedly have an impact on neighboring Lebanon . 
The end of communist autocracies in the Soviet Union , Yugoslavia , and even Czechoslovakia brought about a dramatic wave of state creation . 
Likewise , no one should be surprised if democratization in the Arab world , difficult as it might be , brings in its wake a redrawing of borders . 
How violent or peaceful this may be remains to be seen .
