The Third Way \ u0027s Second Chance 
SANTIAGO - Remember Tony Blair and Bill Clinton &apos;s Third Way ? 
It is back . 
At a June 2000 gathering of leaders in Berlin , hosted by Germany &apos;s then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , the Third Way seemed like the way of the future . 
The gathering was Blair &apos;s brainchild ( though he did not attend because his wife had just had a child ) . 
Leaders from Sweden and New Zealand argued that you could make the state both leaner and more effective . 
And the Third Way could travel well to what was once called the Third World , claimed South Africa &apos;s Thabo Mbeki , Brazil &apos;s Fernando Henrique Cardoso , and Chile &apos;s Ricardo Lagos ( I was present as part of Lagos &apos;s delegation . ) 
Sadly , it was not to last . 
The sound bites about progressive governance did not grow easily into a lasting political philosophy . 
Al Gore traded Clintonomics for traditional populism and was defeated by George W. Bush . 
Social democrats and their allies lost power in several European countries . 
The war in Iraq and the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 caused a backlash against some of the policies advocated by Third Way leaders . 
Fast forward to the present . 
Italy &apos;s 39-year-old socialist prime minister , Matteo Renzi , is often described as his country &apos;s last hope . 
After his electoral victory , Renzi received early kudos from Blair himself , who claimed that &quot; Matteo has the dynamism , creativity , and toughness to succeed . &quot; 
Manuel Valls , France &apos;s Socialist prime minister , is staking his political capital on an ambitious program of tax and spending cuts that does not enjoy the backing of his party &apos;s traditionalist wing . 
Critics from the orthodox left accuse him of &quot; taking solutions from Blair and Schröder . &quot; 
Renzi and Valls - along with Pedro Sánchez of Spain &apos;s Socialist Party - are part of a broader trend . 
With the world economy growing slowly , many center-left politicians are trying to mobilize markets and jump-start growth while investing in jobs and skills . 
Thus , dire need is the immediate explanation for the return of Third Way ideas . 
It is not surprising that deeply indebted European governments are casting about for new social policies at a low fiscal cost . 
But the harsh austerity advocated by Germany &apos;s conservative government is not the same as the gradual adjustment sought by the new generation of Southern social democrats . 
Conservatives demand fiscal adjustment up front , whatever the consequences . 
Modern social democrats who have read their Keynes understand that some immediate adjustment is necessary to make the program credible . 
The other reason for giving Third Way ideas a second hearing is that they work . 
Schröder &apos;s reshaping of Germany &apos;s labor market in the early 2000s was hugely controversial at the time ; but , in retrospect , it turned Germany from the sick man of Europe into the continent &apos;s export powerhouse . 
The Nordic countries have led the way in experimenting with new ways to deliver public services while adopting &quot; flexicurity &quot; in labor relations . 
The result : they have achieved the trifecta of robust growth , high employment , and low public debt . 
The effectiveness of these ideas is not limited to the rich countries of the North . 
The governments of the Concertación in Chile , Alan García in Peru , and Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil all derived inspiration from the Blair-Clinton-Schröder agenda . 
All had ( or have ) their share of controversies . 
In Brazil &apos;s upcoming presidential election , both of the incumbent Dilma Rousseff &apos;s main opponents are advocating policies that hark back to the good old days . 
In the case of Aécio Neves , who belongs to Cardoso &apos;s party , that is not surprising . 
Blair , who gave the Bank of England its full independence during his first week in office , would be proud . 
There are many differences across countries and time , but in the end four ideas are common to these successful experiences . 
The first is policy pragmatism . 
What matters is what works , not what is ideologically pure . 
Instead of the sterile and endless debate as to whether the state should be big or small , it is more fruitful to ask what kind of state intervention , and where . 
The second idea is fiscal realism . 
Budgetary prudence is both desirable ( unsustainable deficits owe their name to the fact that they cannot be sustained ) and progressive ( when things blow up , it is the poor and the vulnerable who suffer the most ) . 
The third idea is modern welfarism . 
The state can and should redistribute income and wealth , but in doing so it should not weaken incentives to work and to save . 
Instead of simply providing handouts , governments should strive to guarantee good jobs at good wages . 
Finally , the Third Way is defined by progressive liberalism . 
Liberty and equality are complementary , not contradictory , principles . 
If the rules are designed properly , a society in which people decide and act freely can also be a society in which opportunities are fairly distributed . 
And conversely , without minimum opportunity for all , liberty is more illusory than real . 
These four ideas animate a Third Way that is now enjoying a second chance - though it should have been the first choice all along .
