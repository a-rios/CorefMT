Putin &apos;s Undercover Liberalism 
When Vladimir Putin was elected Russia &apos;s president little more than a ago , people expected the smack of firm government  -  something most Russians wanted and most outsiders feared . 
In politics , they have gotten just that . 
In economics , however , President Putin has been a stealthy reformer yearning for consensus . 
His caution may be working better than anyone expected . 
When President Putin made German Gref ( a reformer from Saint Petersburg , the president &apos;s home city ) minister in charge of economic development , he ordered him to draw up a longterm strategy for economic reform . 
Given Gref &apos;s reputation , the president knew that any program designed by him would adhere to liberal principles . 
When the program was ready six months later , however , the government approved only an eighteen-month version of it , not the longterm strategy . 
All measures touching on reform of the state were removed . 
Presidential support for Gref appeared on the wane . 
As grumbling against his program grew louder , the President asked the governor of Khabarovsk , Viktor Ishayev , to devise an alternative strategy . 
Ishayev &apos;s plan turned out to be significantly more conservative , and Gref was ordered to incorporate its positive aspects into his program . 
What happened next was surprising . 
Gref &apos;s program was diluted only slightly but gained wide support and the President &apos;s backing . 
The general public approved of this seeming compromise . 
By implicating Ishayev ( a representative of the old and the cautious ) into the process , Putin created the appearance of consensus , but in reality demonstrated that there is no valid economic alternative to a liberal course . 
This process is emblematic of Putin &apos;s hidden-hand style of government . 
He does not charge ahead ; before making a decision , he listens to different opinions and lets emotions cool . 
Gref &apos;s program , too , is emblematic of the President &apos;s style : modernization from above  -  ie , that initiated by government and under its pressure  -  is matched by modernization from below , based on private initiative . 
Undeniably liberal ideas dominate the program : strengthening and protecting property rights , deregulation , and encouraging competition . 
In addition , Gref &apos;s program seeks to create effective private land ownership . 
Deregulation ( &quot; debureaucratization , &quot; really ) will make life easier for new businesses by reducing the number of inspections imposed by bureaucrats and by decreasing the number of demands for licenses and other forms of red tape ( which were also big sources of bribery ) . 
Enhancing competition will mean putting emphasis on antitrust policy and reducing state subsidies . 
But Putin has not become a disciple of Milton Friedman or Margaret Thatcher . 
He clearly believes that the state has a powerful role to play in promoting growth , revitalizing core industries , and reforming and regulating natural monopolies . 
Still , Thatcherite ideas about lower and more transparent tax structures and central control of budgetary expenditures are definitely key parts of his agenda . 
One important aspect of this is the movement of federally mandated expenses ( ie , expenditures ordered by federal legislation but paid for by the regions ) onto the federal budget . 
This will no doubt cause the share of total government expenditures paid by Moscow to rise , but if federal funds cannot pay for something , the costs will no longer be shifted onto the backs of the regions . 
Shifted to the regions , however , is responsibility for many social issues , including the problem of low wages . 
Enormous subsidies , mainly from local budgets , are allocated for housing . 
The federal budget will subsidize this spending through lower tariffs on energy , heat , gas , and rail transport . 
These subsidies are also intended to be used to raise wages ( first of all , for public employees ) and pensions . 
If Gref &apos;s plan is adhered to , by 2005 the poorest 40 % of the population will receive 85 % of social transfers , as opposed to the paltry 36.2 % they received in 1999 . 
This social investment will , it is hoped , be matched by business investment . 
At minimum , average GDP growth of 5 % is expected for the next decade ( a figure now met for over 18 months ) . 
Over this time , government savings are expected to total 30 % of GDP . 
This is an ambitious goal . 
But as capital flight decreases because of the emergence of a more transparent tax regime and legal system , sufficient sources of domestic investment should become available . 
This should allow Russia to start closing the gap with other countries . 
Important changes in the balance of payments are also expected . 
Imports are expected to double and the trade surplus to drop to $ 35 billion in 2004 as a result of equipment and technology imports  -  precisely the pattern a country growing strongly should have . 
The current account balance is to drop to $ 15 billion in 2004 and $ 5 billion in 2010 . 
Some of this should be paid for by growth in the export of services and , more importantly , by capital inflows . 
What makes Gref &apos;s program unique among Russian state budgets since 1991 is its realism : the measures it puts forward are not only necessary but feasible . 
Of course , many doubt whether it will be possible in the time allotted to reduce risk and increase trust so that capital flight is slowed and then reversed . 
Much depends on this happening , however , as both Gref and the President know . 
Still , that task is ambitious , not impossible . 
The important thing is that the methods chosen are the right ones , which means that from President Putin on down legality must not only be respected , but shown to be respected .
