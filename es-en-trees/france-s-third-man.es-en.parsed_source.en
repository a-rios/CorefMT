France &apos;s Third Man 
Should we be watching the French presidential campaign with admiration or alarm ? 
Or perhaps a bit of both ? 
It is undeniably a great &quot; show &quot; with all the ingredients of a Hollywood blockbuster , including a surprising plot twist : the emergence of a &quot; Third Man , &quot; François Bayrou . 
Even if his victory remains unlikely , Bayrou must now be taken seriously . 
First and foremost , he has found in Ségolène Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy two remarkable spokespersons for his candidacy . 
The more Royal returns to the &quot; classics &quot; of the Socialist Party , and the more Sarkozy openly courts the extreme right , the more Bayrou &apos;s popularity rises . 
Indeed , persistent doubts among the French about Royal &apos;s competence and Sarkozy &apos;s character are the primary reasons for his dramatic rise in public opinion polls , from 7 % support at the start of the campaign to 22 % now . 
The second reason for Bayrou &apos;s spectacular rise has less to do with personalities and more with France &apos;s national mood . 
The very reason that led a majority of the French to say &quot; no &quot; to the referendum on the European Union &apos;s draft Constitutional Treaty in May 2005 may lead them to vote for Bayrou , the most pro-European of all candidates . 
Why this paradox ? 
A vote that meant saying &quot; no &quot; to the Constitutional Treaty in 2005 now means saying &quot; no &quot; to the leaders of the French left and right . 
In the 2002 presidential election , frustration with the system fueled strong support for the extremes , with Jean-Marie Le Pen , the leader of the far right , qualifying for the second-round runoff . 
In 2007 , by contrast - and this constitutes real progress - a large segment of the French population is expressing its frustration with the system by being tempted to vote for the &quot; extreme center , &quot; i.e. , Bayrou . 
Bayrou has been in politics for a long time , including as a presidential candidate in 2002 . 
But , while his record as education minister is far from impressive , he has successfully reinvented his image in the last few months , becoming the &quot; new man &quot; of French politics . 
He looks more reassuring than Sarkozy and sounds more competent than Royal . 
This would not be enough for Bayrou in ordinary times , but today , on both sides of the political divide , opponents of the main candidates seem ready to join forces with him and betray their respective camps . 
What makes Bayrou potentially so strong is the fact that widespread reservations about the two leading candidates are influencing the calculus of militants and politicians alike . 
On the conservative side , Jacques Chirac now officially supports Sarkozy , but he may also secretly encourage his most loyal supporters to vote for Bayrou , even if there is no love lost between the two men . 
On the left , the social democratic wing of the Socialist party , which backed Dominique Strauss-Kahn against Royal , may be tempted to align with Bayrou , too , owing to the prospect of a post-electoral alliance between the center left and the center right . 
That said , surveys of the electorate demonstrate that a large proportion is still undecided , particularly among Bayrou &apos;s supporters . 
So it is too early to say whether Bayrou can reach the second round . 
But if he does , he is likely to prove irresistible . 
A Bayrou victory , which is unlikely but not impossible , would constitute a triple revolution . 
It would lead first to the end of the Socialist Party created by François Mitterrand . 
Following Lionel Jospin &apos;s humiliating defeat in 2002 , the Socialists simply would not survive a second consecutive failure to reach the second round . 
Moreover , a Bayrou victory could signify the end of the conservative party created by Chirac , as well as of Charles de Gaulle &apos;s Fifth Republic . 
But de Gaulle &apos;s legacy would most likely be snuffed out gently , with nostalgia for both Mitterrand and Chirac possibly proving very tempting for a people disaffected with the political system but desiring to be reassured . 
France wants the illusion of change , but is continuity what she truly desires ? . 
Finally , while this election was expected to usher in a new generation of politicians , few were prepared to anticipate the peaceful political tsunami that a Bayrou victory would bring . 
Yet that would be the outcome if the attraction towards the center proves to be as irresistible for significant segments of the Socialists and conservative parties as it now seems . 
France is a marvelously paradoxical country , so the search for novelty , if not modernity , could lead to the reinvention of the Fourth Republic , a parliamentary regime characterized by its weaknesses and instability . 
That will depend in part on whether the perception of Sarkozy as a risky candidate will prove greater than the very real institutional risk represented by Bayrou . 
There is maybe less of a French presence in the world today than there was twelve years ago when Jacques Chirac came to power , especially since the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in 2005 . 
But the world &apos;s interest in the French presidential campaign is greater than ever , and can be compared only with the attention generated by Mitterrand &apos;s election in 1981 . 
Much may change in the few weeks left before the first round of the presidential vote .
