The False Promise of Digital Democracy 
MUNICH - Most people used to think of the Internet as a force for good . 
It was supposed to allow us not only to shop , stay in touch with former classmates , and find a new sushi restaurant ; it was also supposed to empower us politically by allowing the disenfranchised to make their voices heard , help activists mobilize supporters , and enable ordinary citizens to publicize evidence of official corruption or police brutality . 
But doubts have crept in - and not only since the revelations of government agencies &quot; use of the Internet to spy on us , our leaders , and one another . 
The Internet &apos;s impact on politics is deeply ambiguous . 
Early enthusiasts dreamed that mere access to the Internet would help spread democracy . 
This did not happen . 
At the end of the 1990 &quot; s , 4 % of the world &apos;s population was using the Internet ; today , almost 40 % do . 
But the share of countries classified as &quot; not free &quot; or &quot; partly free &quot; by the democracy watchdog Freedom House has hardly changed over the same period . 
In the battle between networks and hierarchies , the hierarchies seem to be winning more often than not . 
One reason is that governments have become as skillful at using the Internet and modern communications technology as activists . 
Autocratic governments use it to track down protest and opposition leaders , as we have recently seen in Ukraine . 
They employ armies of people to vet and skew online conversations . 
Some people even argue that the Internet acts as a political release valve that helps dictators stay in power . 
But even the most determined autocrat cannot fully control political activity online . 
Tech-savvy young people tend to circumvent attempts at official censorship . 
And yet Internet activists are not necessarily gaining power . 
Internet-inspired movements usually have lasting impact only if they generate traditional political activity , such as street protests or the establishment of political parties . 
For this , they need leadership , which net activists tend to reject , because they view themselves as pure grassroots movements . 
In the absence of viable strategies and clear direction , most Internet-aided uprisings have dissipated quickly . 
The Internet has thus turned out to be less potent than expected in the fight against tyranny . 
Nor is its effect on established democracies straightforward . 
While democracies have arguably become more vibrant , their politics have become more volatile . 
Consider the media . 
Digital media offer great diversity , easy access , and opportunities to comment . 
While traditional media can present their readers with balanced coverage , digital media can fuel political polarization . 
Moreover , political firebrands , populists , and radicals , from Italy &apos;s Beppe Grillo to American Tea Party members , use social media and the blogosphere to appeal directly to potential supporters . 
The Internet allows many political upstarts to amass a large following quickly , only to disappear just as fast . 
But the ebb and flow can unsettle established politics - for example , when centrist parties move to the right to lure voters away from more extreme parties . 
At the same time , young people seem to think that they have exhausted their civic duties by tweeting and blogging . 
They no longer join political parties , trade unions , and other interest groups . 
The average age of party members in Germany is over 50 . 
In the United Kingdom , a retiree over 60 is more likely to be a trade-union member than a worker under 30 is . 
Without civil-society organizations , politics becomes more fragmented and less cohesive - and finding workable compromises becomes harder . 
The revelations of snooping by the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) will hasten a more realistic assessment of the Internet &apos;s effect on politics , providing a welcome opportunity to consider what has gone wrong and what could be put right . 
A multitude of small steps could help - such as giving pro-democracy movements the technology needed to evade autocrats , presenting digital media in a balanced way , and making political parties more responsive to their members . 
But the fundamental challenge is to suffuse the Internet with the same rules , rights , and values that pervade our democracies . 
Freedom cannot be absolute , whether online or offline . 
Human rights , and not only the right to personal privacy , must be respected in cyberspace . 
Because no single body or government sets rules for the entire Internet , any digital code of conduct would have to emerge from the grassroots - and thus would be highly imperfect . 
But perhaps the NSA has helped start the discussion : though we may not know which rules we want , we may now have gained a much better idea of which rules we do not want .
