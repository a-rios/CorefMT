An Economic Agenda for Italy 
MILAN - At the end of this month , Italian voters will choose their next government , from which they expect jobs and a more level economic playing field - and from which Italy &apos;s European partners expect structural reforms and fiscal probity . 
What should the new government &apos;s economic-policy agenda be ? 
To reduce public debt , which stands above 120 % of GDP , while minimizing painful adjustments , Italy needs economic growth - something that has eluded policymakers in recent years . 
Indeed , Italy &apos;s average annual GDP growth rate since joining Europe &apos;s economic and monetary union in 1999 has been an anemic 0.5 % , well below the eurozone average of nearly 1.5 % . 
In the four years since the global financial crisis struck , the growth rate fell to -1.2 % , compared to the eurozone average of -0.2 % , and it is expected to remain negative this year . 
The new government &apos;s biggest challenge will be to implement reforms that enable Italy &apos;s economic performance to catch up to that of its neighbors after years of bad policies and neglect . 
This requires increased investment in innovation and human capital . 
From 1992 to 2011 , labor productivity grew at an average annual rate of 0.9 % , the lowest in the OECD . 
Since 2001 , unit labor costs have been growing faster than real GDP and employment , undermining the economy &apos;s competitiveness vis-à-vis developing countries . 
In the last decade , Italy &apos;s share of global exports dropped from 3.9 % to 2.9 % . 
Persistently weak labor-productivity growth has created a situation in which unit labor costs do not fall , even if real wages remain stagnant or decline . 
Indeed , despite a 1.3 % drop in real wages in 2011 , unit labor costs remained unchanged . 
Italy &apos;s new leaders must address this situation by decoupling labor &apos;s contribution to productivity growth from that of capital and total factor productivity . 
According to the OECD , lower regulatory costs and more efficient public administration ( building upon measures introduced by the previous government , led by Mario Monti ) could add 0.3-0.4 % to average annual GDP growth by 2020 . 
Likewise , labor-market reform , improved education , and enhanced human capital could contribute an additional 4 % to GDP growth in the next decade . 
Moreover , Italian policymakers should strive to boost the female labor-force participation rate , which , at 49 % , is one of the lowest in the OECD . 
Doing so would raise per capita income by 1 % annually through 2030 . 
At the same time , fiscal adjustment remains essential to Italy &apos;s short- and long-term stability . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , the budget deficit is declining , and the primary surplus ( net revenues minus interest payments ) is growing . 
Italy &apos;s new leadership must sustain this progress . 
Despite positive developments , the road ahead is bumpy . 
Navigating it will require Italy to retain its credibility with other European Union member states and international investors . 
The new prime minister will need to persuade Germany , financial markets , and the European Council that Italy is a reliable partner . 
The ability to refinance government debt and keep costs down is essential to strengthening public finances and boosting GDP growth . 
Furthermore , attracting more direct investment is crucial , given that capital inflows , while recovering , remain 30 % below their pre-crisis level ; with outflows exceeding inflows , Italy has become a net capital exporter . 
&quot; Selling &quot; Italy in Europe should entail more than photo opportunities with other leaders in Brussels and the occasional road show to financial institutions in London . 
Italy &apos;s leaders should engage actively in commercial diplomacy , using the country &apos;s embassies and trade agencies to promote Italy globally , while working to build strong bilateral relations with other EU members , particularly southern countries like Spain . 
At the same time , the new leaders need to &quot; sell &quot; Europe in Italy , where Euro-skepticism is rampant . 
According to the Pew Research Global Attitudes Project , only 30 % of Italians view the euro positively . 
In the country &apos;s wealthier north , where average per capita income , at € 30,000 ( $ 40,500 ) , approaches that of Germany , people are questioning the rationale of EU membership . 
The costs are evident , they argue , but what are the benefits ? 
Meanwhile , fears of structural decline pervade the country . 
The crisis has lasted for a long time , and people are tired . 
Unemployment has risen to a record 11.2 % , with 35 % of young people jobless . 
And the tax burden , which has exceeded 40 % of GDP since 1990 , now stands at almost 43 % of GDP . 
A Scandinavian level of taxes would be bearable if public services did not remain inferior to those offered in Scandinavia . 
For example , per capita health-care spending in Sweden , Denmark , and Finland exceeds $ 3,000 , compared to only $ 2,300 in Italy , where households must contribute roughly 20 % of total health-care spending . 
Moreover , Italy spends around 4.5 % of GDP on education , while the Scandinavian countries spend more than 6 % of GDP . 
As a result , Italian students &quot; scores in the Program for International Student Assessment are significantly lower than those of their counterparts in many other OECD countries . 
Italy &apos;s new government will have to display leadership and vision to guide the economy toward stable growth , avert a race to the bottom , and stem growing social tension . 
Most important , economic renewal depends on the next government &apos;s willingness and ability to address the institutional weaknesses that have made concerted action increasingly urgent .
