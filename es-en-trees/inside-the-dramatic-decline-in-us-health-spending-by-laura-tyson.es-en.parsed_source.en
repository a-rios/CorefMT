America &apos;s Healthy Path to Fiscal Health 
BERKELEY - Over the last five years , the growth of health-care spending in the United States has slowed dramatically - to the lowest rate in the past 50 years . 
The slowdown is not a surprise . 
It is a predictable result of the recession and slow recovery that have left millions of Americans without health insurance and dampened household spending . 
But the size of the slowdown is surprising , as is the fact that it started several years before the 2008 recession - and not only in the private insurance system , but also in Medicare and Medicaid , the two major government health programs . 
( Medicare provides health coverage for retirees , and Medicaid provides coverage for low-income Americans and their children and those with disabilities . ) 
What explains this slowdown in health-care spending ? 
How much of it is attributable to the weak economy , and how much is the result of changes in provider and consumer behavior ? 
Two recent studies offer different answers , but both predict that at least some of the slowdown will persist even after the economy recovers . 
That would be good news for the US economy , which currently devotes nearly 18 % of GDP to health care , by far the largest share among developed countries . 
It would also be good news for America &apos;s fiscal position , because Medicare and Medicaid are the two largest contributors to the long-term federal budget deficit . 
The growth of health-care spending declined or remained unchanged in real ( inflation-adjusted ) terms each year between 2002 and 2011 , falling to 3-3.1 % in 2009-2011 , the lowest rates on record since reporting began in 1960 . 
Recent data indicate that after a slight acceleration in 2012 , the growth of real health-care spending in 2013 has fallen back to its 2009-2011 average . 
As a result of the recession and lagging recovery , health-care spending has also slowed significantly since 2009 throughout the OECD . 
Indeed , for the first time on record , real health-care spending stalled on average in the OECD in 2010 , as developed countries , reeling from budgetary constraints , clamped down on health programs . 
Growth in health-care spending was slower in every OECD country in that year , with the exception of Germany . 
A new study by Drew Altman , a respected health-care expert and President of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation , concludes that slower growth in real GDP , along with a lower inflation rate , accounts for more than three-quarters of the slowdown in health-care spending in the US after 2001 . 
The weak economy has caused people to postpone consumption of health-care services and has encouraged states and employers to restrain their spending on health . 
But important cost-containing changes in the private health-care system , including more cost-sharing in private insurance plans and tighter controls in managed care , have also contributed to the slowdown . 
Altman conjectures that , overall , the growth in health-care spending between 2008 and 2012 was about one percentage point lower than predicted by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions alone . 
If this reduction continues after the economy recovers - as seems likely , given the cost-containment incentives in the Affordable Care Act ( commonly known as Obamacare ) - the US stands to spend $ 2 trillion less on health care over the coming decade . 
Based on the relationship between changes in real per capita health-care spending and changes in unemployment rates at the state level , the recent Economic Report of the President concludes that the recession and lackluster recovery account for less than 20 % of the slowdown in health-care spending since 2007 - and for an even smaller share of the slowdown that began in 2002 . 
And difficult macroeconomic conditions explain little ( if any ) of the slowdown in Medicare spending per enrollee since 2001 . 
That is not unexpected , because the largely retired Medicare population is less vulnerable to macroeconomic fluctuations than is the working-age population . 
The Council of Economic Advisers , whose members write the president &apos;s report , surmise that structural changes - including stronger incentives for efficiency by hospitals and providers , more cost-sharing in insurance policies , and the substitution of generic drugs for branded drugs - explain most of the deceleration in per capita spending growth . 
They also suggest that payment reforms contributed to the slowdown in Medicare &apos;s spending growth after 2001 , and that early responses to new Medicare regulations in the Affordable Care Act may have caused a further decline after 2010 . 
The long-term effect on the federal budget implied by a sustained reduction in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid spending to the rates of the last several years would be profound . 
These programs currently claim 21 % of the budget , with Medicare accounting for two-thirds of that amount . 
Even a small reduction in the growth of these programs would save billions of dollars . 
Based on the unexpected slowdown in spending growth during the last few years , the Congressional Budget Office recently cut its ten-year projections for these programs by 3.5 % , reducing the ten-year deficit by $ 382 billion . 
In 2011 , Medicare spending accounted for 3.7 % of GDP . 
Based on current policies , the government forecasts that Medicare spending per beneficiary will grow at an average annual rate of 4.3 % and will rise to 6.7 % of GDP over the next 75 years . 
If , instead , Medicare spending per beneficiary grew by only 3.6 % a year , the average rate of the last five years , Medicare &apos;s share of GDP would remain unchanged . 
This would narrow the fiscal gap , a widely used measure of long-term budgetary imbalance , by almost one-third . 
Trends in the US budget reflect an inconvenient truth : If the growth of spending on health-care programs cannot be slowed , stabilizing the federal debt at a sustainable level will require deep cuts in spending on other priorities and increases in taxes on the middle class . 
The recent slowdown in the growth of health-care spending is a promising sign that America &apos;s budgetary tradeoffs may turn out to be less difficult than expected .
