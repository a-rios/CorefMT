Bye-Bye , Middle East ? 
PARIS - For some time now , a certain strategic vision has been gaining traction : the United States is becoming energy-independent , paving the way for its political retreat from the Middle East and justifying its strategic &quot; pivot &quot; toward Asia . 
This view seems intuitively correct , but is it ? 
Energy-hungry America has long depended on the global market to meet domestic demand . 
In 2005 , the US imported 60 % of the energy that it consumed . 
Since then , however , the share of imports has decreased , and it should continue to do so . 
The US is expected to become energy self-sufficient in 2020 , and to become an oil exporter by 2030 . 
This scenario would grant the US three enormous advantages . 
It would enhance US economic competitiveness , especially relative to Europe , given the lower costs involved in the extraction of shale gas . 
It would also reduce America &apos;s exposure to growing unrest in the Arab world . 
Finally , it would increase the relative vulnerability of America &apos;s main strategic rival , China , which is becoming increasingly dependent on Middle East energy supplies . 
These facts obviously need to be taken seriously , but their implications for US foreign policy in the Middle East should not be too hastily drawn . 
Above all , though energy dependence is a key element of US policy in the region , it is far from being the only factor . 
Israel &apos;s security and the desire to contain Iran are equally important . 
Moreover , the Middle East &apos;s role in the global geopolitics of energy will grow in the coming decades , making it difficult to see how a superpower like the US could simply walk away from the region . 
Within the next 15 years , OPEC countries will account for 50 % of global oil production , compared to only 42 % today . 
Furthermore , the country on which this increase will most likely hinge is Iraq . 
Could the US ignore a country that in roughly ten years will become the world &apos;s second-largest oil exporter , generating more than $ 200 billion annually in revenue , while increasingly being dominated by an authoritarian Shia regime that is close to Iran ? 
Would it withdraw in the face of the consequent strategic threat to its three allies - Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and Israel - in the region ? 
Such a possibility seems even more far-fetched as long as the Iranian nuclear crisis remains unresolved and the Syrian crisis continues to widen the region &apos;s Shia-Sunni divide ( reflected in increased tension between Turkey and Iran ) . 
Even as US President Barack Obama was visiting Asia in November - a trip meant to underscore America &apos;s &quot; pivot &quot; - he was forced to devote considerable time and attention to mediating a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza . 
Indeed , if oil were truly America &apos;s only or paramount interest in the Middle East , its special relationship with Israel would be mystifying , given the harm that it implies for US interests among Arab oil exporters . 
Even when its energy dependence on the Middle East was at its peak , the US rarely altered its policy of support for Israel . 
It is also important to bear in mind that in 1973 , the US suffered less from the OPEC oil embargo than Europe did , even though America , which had resupplied Israel in its war with Egypt and Syria in October of that year , was the primary target . 
In the end , America &apos;s position in the region strengthened after Egypt became a US ally and made peace with Israel . 
China &apos;s growing interest in the Middle East also decreases the likelihood of an American withdrawal . 
The US will remain concerned about ensuring the security of energy supplies for its Asian allies , which , like China , are increasingly dependent on the region &apos;s oil exporters . 
Nevertheless , while an American withdrawal from the Middle East seems highly unlikely , US exposure to the region will indeed decline ; as that happens , America &apos;s role there will probably become more subdued - and perhaps more cynical . 
Its involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will likely be limited to maintaining the status quo rather than seeking a comprehensive settlement . 
This stance - suggested by America &apos;s opposition to granting Palestine observer-state status at the United Nations - would amount to an admission by the US that it has given up on the creation of two states in the Middle East . 
That would certainly satisfy Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian fringe seeking to weaken the Palestinian Authority . 
But it would fully vindicate those who believe that Obama is more a man of good will than a visionary .
