Iraq &apos;s Silent Dead 
Evidence is mounting that America &apos;s war in Iraq has killed tens of thousands of civilian Iraqis , and perhaps well over one hundred thousand . 
Yet this carnage is systematically ignored in the United States , where the media and government portray a war in which there are no civilian deaths , because there are no Iraqi civilians , only insurgents . 
American behavior and self-perceptions reveal the ease with which a civilized country can engage in large-scale killing of civilians without public discussion . 
In late October , the British medical journal Lancet published a study of civilian deaths in Iraq since the US-led invasion began . 
The sample survey documented an extra 100,000 Iraqi civilian deaths compared to the death rate in the preceding year , when Saddam Hussein was still in power - and this estimate did not even count excess deaths in Falluja , which was deemed too dangerous to include . 
The study also noted that the majority of deaths resulted from violence , and that a high proportion of the violent deaths were due to US aerial bombing . 
The epidemiologists acknowledged the uncertainties of these estimates , but presented enough data to warrant an urgent follow-up investigation and reconsideration by the Bush administration and the US military of aerial bombing of Iraq &apos;s urban areas . 
America &apos;s public reaction has been as remarkable as the Lancet study , for the reaction has been no reaction . 
The vaunted New York Times ran a single story of 770 words on page 8 of the paper ( October 29 ) . 
The Times reporter apparently did not interview a single Bush administration or US military official . 
No follow-up stories or editorials appeared , and no New York Times reporters assessed the story on the ground . 
Coverage in other US papers was similarly frivolous . 
The Washington Post ( October 29 ) carried a single 758-word story on page 16 . 
Recent reporting on the bombing of Falluja has also been an exercise in self-denial . 
The New York Times ( November 6 ) wrote that &quot; warplanes pounded rebel positions &quot; in Falluja , without noting that &quot; rebel positions &quot; are actually in civilian neighborhoods . 
Another New York Times story ( November 12 ) , citing &quot; military officials , &quot; dutifully reported that , &quot; Since the assault began on Monday , about 600 rebels have been killed , along with 18 American and 5 Iraqi soldiers . &quot; 
The issue of civilian deaths was not even raised . 
Violence is only one reason for the increase in civilian deaths in Iraq . 
Children in urban war zones die in vast numbers from diarrhea , respiratory infections , and other causes , owing to unsafe drinking water , lack of refrigerated foods , and acute shortages of blood and basic medicines at clinics and hospitals ( that is , if civilians even dare to leave their houses for medical care ) . 
Yet the Red Crescent and other relief agencies have been unable to relieve Falluja &apos;s civilian population . 
On November 14 , the front page of The New York Times led with the following description : &quot; Army tanks and fighting vehicles blasted their way into the last main rebel stronghold in Falluja at sundown on Saturday after American warplanes and artillery prepared the way with a savage barrage on the district . 
Earlier in the afternoon , 10 separate plumes of smoke rose from Southern Falluja , as it etched against the desert sky , and probably exclaimed catastrophe for the insurgents . &quot; 
There is , once again , virtually no mention of the catastrophe for civilians etched against that desert sky . 
There is a hint , though , in a brief mention in the middle of the story of a father looking over his wounded sons in a hospital and declaring that , &quot; Now Americans are shooting randomly at anything that moves . &quot; 
A few days later , a US television film crew was in a bombed-out mosque with US troops . 
While the cameras were rolling , a US marine turned to an unarmed and wounded Iraqi lying on the ground and murdered the man with gunshots to the head . 
( Reportedly , there were a few other such cases of outright murder . ) 
But the American media more or less brushed aside this shocking incident , too . 
The Wall Street Journal actually wrote an editorial on November 18 that criticized the critics , noting as usual that whatever the US does , its enemies in Iraq do worse , as if this excuses American abuses . 
It does not . 
The US is killing massive numbers of Iraqi civilians , embittering the population and the Islamic world , and laying the ground for escalating violence and death . 
No number of slaughtered Iraqis will bring peace . 
The American fantasy of a final battle , in Falluja or elsewhere , or the capture of some terrorist mastermind , perpetuates a cycle of bloodletting that puts the world in peril . 
Worse still , America &apos;s public opinion , media , and election results have left the world &apos;s most powerful military without practical restraint .
