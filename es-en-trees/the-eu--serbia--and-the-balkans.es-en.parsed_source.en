The EU , Serbia , and the Balkans 
BRUSSELS : On September 24 , despite a system heavily rigged against them , Serbia &apos;s people voted - in huge numbers - for spring after a long political winter . 
They demanded a new start for their country - the chance to consign to history the economic and political misery endured in recent years . 
Today , they have that new start . 
Ten years after the rest of postcommunist Europe , Serbia must begin establishing an open , democratic society . 
The EU has made clear its willingness to help a democratic Serbia re-join the family of Europe . 
The EU symbolizes one of history &apos;s most successful attempts by countries and peoples to overcome division through partnership and co-operation , where competition on a level playing field replaces battlefield conflict . 
Fifty years ago , few thought that possible . 
Much of Western Europe was rubble . 
Enmities smoldered . 
With generous support from America , we built a robust community of democracies , whose economic wealth and political liberty helped us stand firm in the face of tyranny . 
Yugoslavia &apos;s enmities , and the ruins of its economy , need to be addressed in a similar spirit . 
The EU &apos;s record is clear . 
When Communism collapsed , we set about helping the countries of Eastern Europe to establish democracy and make the transition to the market economy . 
We did so with the same commitment and faith in their ability to succeed that the US devoted to re-building Western Europe after WWII . 
In the ten years since the Berlin Wall &apos;s fall these countries have been transformed and are on the way to joining the EU . 
War in Europe , we told ourselves , could never happen again . 
But it did , in the Balkans . 
All Europe &apos;s demons had not been exorcised . 
After a decade of war , we are now humbler , wiser , I hope - but more determined to turn the page , to work with the countries and peoples of Southeast Europe not to escape their neighborhood , but to transform it . 
That is what the Stability Pact is about - a recognition that the region &apos;s problems must be tackled in the round ; a recognition that coping with crisis after crisis is far more costly than implementing a long-term strategy for peace . 
The EU , indeed , faces few greater tests of its ability to project stability than in the Balkans . 
Last year in Kosovo , America bore the brunt of the military campaign . 
American and European peacekeepers serve alongside each other in Kosovo and in Bosnia . 
Nearly two thirds of those troops - some 30,000 of them - are from EU nations . 
Our overall strategy is clear : to build a strong , stable network of democracies in the region , a network that - we hope - will now include Serbia . 
We are starting to implement such a strategy by building , literally and metaphorically , Southeast Europe &apos;s road to integration with the rest of Europe and the Euro-Atlantic community . 
That road is built on a foundation in which solid reform is backed by substantial assistance . 
We have spent nearly 8bn euros in reconstruction and humanitarian assistance in the region since 1991 ; 
EU financial assistance to the region during those years amounts to 17bn euros . 
This year , the European Commission is spending nearly 600m euros rebuilding lives in Kosovo and Bosnia , backing brave and newly elected leaders in Croatia , supporting reform in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( fYROM ) and Albania . 
In Montenegro , the EU provided considerable support as its government stood up to Milosevic . 
We doubled - to 20 million euros - the EU &apos;s assistance to Montenegro this year . 
The European Council in Lisbon ordered further assistance to help alleviate the immediate financial needs of Montenegro . 
We stand ready to offer assistance to Serbia in the same spirit . 
When Serbia &apos;s new leaders look around , indeed , they can see real progress in the region : in Croatia , which has blazed a democratic trail since elections earlier this year ; in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , which has nearly concluded negotiations with the EU for a Stabilization and Association Agreement , the first country to do so ; in Albania , which is persevering with political and economic reforms ; and in Bosnia , where refugee return has accelerated . 
Even in Kosovo , where obstacles remain formidable , progress is being made . 
That progress is taking place at a regional level too : a regional investment compact , a regional anti-corruption initiative , media reform . 
Agreements to upgrade the Blace border-crossing between fYROM and Kosovo , and to build a new bridge over the Danube between Bulgaria and Romania have been made . 
These are real achievements , which the Stability Pact helped broker . 
Europe is also funding a substantial package of &amp; gt ; Quick Start &quot; projects - ready to begin now or in the next twelve months - to upgrade bridges , roads , airports , water systems , and electricity networks across the region . 
Just as important are projects to install institutional &amp; gt ; software &quot; - public administration , a free media , independent judiciaries , functioning , accountable institutions in which all members of the community can place trust and confidence . 
The European Commission pledged 530 million euros for projects under the Quick Start package . 
Cooperation , however , is a two-way street . 
To succeed , these efforts must be matched with equal determination by the countries of the region in delivering on reform . 
That approach - help for self-help , inextricably linked to actual reforms - lies at the heart of the EU &apos;s Stabilization and Association process . 
That process will bring - is already starting to bring - substantial benefits to the region in terms of trade access , political dialogue , and regional co-operation . 
Indeed , we recently agreed radical proposals to expand trade access - through asymmetric trade measures - to the EU market for the countries of the region . 
These come into effect on 1 November . 
Eighteen months after the air strikes in Kosovo , we are making headway . 
The changes in Serbia provide evidence that the people of Serbia , too , have noticed what is happening in the rest of their region and no longer want to miss out . 
We , too , don &apos;t want them to miss out on better ties to Europe .
