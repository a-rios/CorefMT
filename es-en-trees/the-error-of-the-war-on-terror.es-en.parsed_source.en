The Error of the War on Terror 
Israel &apos;s failure to subdue Hezbollah demonstrates the many weaknesses of the war-on-terror concept . 
One weakness is that even if the targets are terrorists , the victims are often innocent civilians , and their suffering reinforces the terrorist cause . 
In response to Hezbollah &apos;s attacks , Israel was justified in attacking Hezbollah to protect itself against the threat of missiles on its border . 
However , Israel should have taken greater care to minimize collateral damage . 
The civilian casualties and material damage inflicted on Lebanon inflamed Muslims and world opinion against Israel and converted Hezbollah from aggressors to heroes of resistance . 
Weakening Lebanon has also made it more difficult to rein in Hezbollah . 
Another weakness of the war-on-terror concept is that it relies on military action and rules out political approaches . 
Israel withdrew from Lebanon and then from Gaza unilaterally , rather than negotiating political settlements with the Lebanese government and the Palestinian authority . 
The strengthening of Hezbollah and Hamas was a direct consequence of that approach . 
The war-on-terror concept stands in the way of recognizing this fact because it separates &quot; us &quot; from &quot; them &quot; and denies that our actions may shape their behavior . 
A third weakness is that the war-on-terror concept lumps together different political movements that use terrorist tactics . 
It fails to distinguish between Hamas , Hezbollah , al Qaeda or the Sunni insurrection and the Mahdi militia in Iraq . 
Yet all these terrorist manifestations are different and require different responses . 
Neither Hamas nor Hezbollah can be treated merely as targets in the war on terror because they have deep roots in their societies ; yet profound differences exist between them . 
Looking back it is easy to see where Israeli policy went wrong . 
When Mahmoud Abbas was elected president of the Palestinian Authority , Israel should have gone out of its way to strengthen him and his reformist team . 
When Israel withdrew from Gaza the former head of the World Bank , James Wolfensohn , negotiated a six-point plan on behalf of the Quartet for the Middle East ( Russia , the United States , the European Union and the United Nations ) . 
It included opening crossings between Gaza and the West Bank , an airport and seaport in Gaza , opening the border with Egypt , and transferring the greenhouses abandoned by Israeli settlers into Arab hands . 
None of the six points was implemented . 
This contributed to Hamas &apos;s electoral victory . 
The Bush administration , having pushed Israel to allow the Palestinians to hold elections , then backed Israel &apos;s refusal to deal with a Hamas government . 
The effect was to impose further hardship on the Palestinians . 
Nevertheless , Abbas was able to forge an agreement with the political arm of Hamas for the formation of a unity government . 
It was to foil this agreement that the military branch of Hamas , run from Damascus , engaged in the provocation that brought a heavy handed response from Israel - which in turn incited Hezbollah to further provocation , opening a second front . 
That is how extremists play off against each other to destroy any chance of political progress . 
Israel has been a participant in this game and President Bush bought into this flawed policy , uncritically supporting Israel . 
Events have shown that this policy leads to an escalation of violence . 
The process has advanced to the point where Israel &apos;s unquestioned military superiority is no longer sufficient to overcome the negative consequences of its policy . 
Israel is now more endangered in its existence than it was at the time of the Oslo Agreement . 
Similarly , the US has become less safe since President Bush declared war on terror . 
The time has come to realize that today &apos;s policies are counterproductive . 
There will be no end to the vicious circle of escalating violence without a political settlement of the Palestine question . 
In fact , the prospects for engaging in negotiations are better now than they were a few months ago . 
Israelis must realize that a military deterrent is not sufficient on its own . 
And Arabs , having redeemed themselves on the battlefield , may be more willing to entertain a compromise . 
Strong voices argue that Israel must never negotiate from a position of weakness . 
They are wrong . 
Israel &apos;s position is liable to become weaker the longer it persists on its present course . 
Similarly Hezbollah , having tasted the sense but not the reality of victory ( and egged on by Syria and Iran ) may prove recalcitrant . 
But that is where the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas comes into play . 
The people of Palestine yearn for peace and relief from suffering . 
The political - as distinct from the military -  wing of Hamas must be responsive to their desires . 
It is not too late for Israel to encourage and deal with an Abbas led Palestinian unity government as the first step toward a better balanced approach . 
Given how strong the U.S.-Israeli relationship is , it would help Israel achieve its own legitimate aims if the U.S. government were not blinded by the war-on-terror concept .
