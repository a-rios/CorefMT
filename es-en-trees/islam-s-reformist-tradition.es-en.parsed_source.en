Islam \ u0027s Reformist Tradition 
The &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; supposedly underway between the West and the Muslim world , which many see as manifested in Iraq , as well as in Saudi Arabia &apos;s growing violence , in fact masks other conflicts - disputes that will probably prove to be far more significant in the long term . 
One of these struggles is taking place among Muslims themselves over the shape of reform within their own societies . 
The Muslim reformist tradition - the search for an authentic path that links Islam &apos;s traditions to the modern world - has deep roots , stretching back to the middle of the 19th century . 
Back then , Muslim thinkers contrasted the decline of their own societies with Europe &apos;s dynamism , a particularly painful distinction in light of European successes in colonizing large parts of the Muslim world . 
Then , too , Muslim intellectuals focused on the &quot; decadence &quot; of Muslim societies , their debilitating political and social corruption . 
Many early Muslim reformists were clerics or senior bureaucrats , who had seen first hand how diminished their societies had become . 
More importantly , they were members of a tiny minority that had been educated in the written heritage of Islam . 
Far beyond Koranic recitation , these men aspired to participate in the centuries-long discussions among Muslim scholars about the proper ordering of Muslim life . 
This training enabled them to compare the debased state of affairs of their time with the norms and aspirations of earlier generations of clerics and thinkers . 
Their judgment was clear : Muslims had sunk far below what their religion required them to be , and lagged far behind the accomplishments of their ancestors . 
For the reformers , normality meant the progressive development of Muslim societies , and they tied this to the interaction of Islamic teaching with relevant , worldly ideas of the time . 
So these first reformers sought to engage with the ideas that they saw emerging from Europe : rationality , tolerance and ethically determined behavior . 
These early reformers , among them Muhammad Abduh and Jamaleddin al-Afghani , did not ignite the mass mobilization they hoped for , and were not able to redress social ills through better implementation of religious prescriptions . 
But their influence was powerful and lasting , and extended in directions that they could not have anticipated . 
The paradox here is that the open-minded reformism they espoused helped stir conservative trends among Islamic thinkers , who seized on the reformists &apos; revival of Islamic norms to urge a return to the &quot; purity &quot; of the first Islamic societies . 
This conservative trend did not follow-up on the reformists &apos; engagement with the modern ideas of the European Enlightenment , arguing instead that these represented a further estrangement from authentic Islamic values . 
Thus , the most lasting effect of the first reformist wave was the establishment of a &quot; salafi &quot; ( traditionalist ) trend and eventually the emergence of an even more radical fundamentalism . 
Both conservative traditionalists and radical fundamentalists were drawn to political activism and came to regard the modern state as a means to liberate Muslims from foreign domination and to re-Islamicize society through a revival of Islam &apos;s original norms . 
Today , we can see the force of this ideology , but it would be a mistake to assume that the spirit of the original Muslim reformists has vanished . 
Out of the spotlight , countless Muslim scholars and academics have continued to probe the connections between Islamic thought and modern values . 
Drawing on critical scholarship in history and theology , they have detailed the ways in which Muslims have changed - and continue to change - their traditions , in different times and places . 
Thus , a sharp , focused challenge to the assertions of religious orthodoxy has emerged in the work of such important thinkers as Abdolkarim Soroush ( Iran ) , Abdelmajid Charfi ( Tunisia ) , Fazlur Rahman ( Pakistan ) , and Mahmud Muhammad Taha ( Sudan ) . 
While their work encounters great resistance from traditionalist and fundamentalist circles ( whose views are widely covered in mainstream Muslim and Western media ) , these contemporary reformers - and the questions they have raised - have had a big impact on a rising generation of Muslim intellectuals around the world . 
Of course , listeners must strain to hear the voices of reformists amidst the din of those calling for resistance to the enemy and a return to the pure sources of Islam . 
However , the seeds of a new wave of &quot; reform &quot; have taken root , and await an early thaw to sprout . 
The reformists of the first wave attempted to &quot; reopen the doors of Ijtihad ( religious interpretation ) &quot; in order to adapt the inherited systems of Islamic thinking to new conditions . 
Today &apos;s reformists are subjecting these traditional frameworks to scrutiny and attempting to separate the core ethical principles of Islam from the various historical adaptations that conservatives have enshrined as sacred . 
Adapting Islam to modern conditions was the purpose of the first generation of reformers . 
By engaging fully with the main currents of modern thinking , their contemporary successors seek to better understand how universal principles can be expressed through Muslim tradition .
