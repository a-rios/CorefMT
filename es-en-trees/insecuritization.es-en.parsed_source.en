Insecuritization 
BRUSSELS - There is no shortage of analyses of what went wrong in the world &apos;s capital markets over the past 18 months . 
What is clear is that a complex set of relationships , interactions , events , and omissions on the part of many different actors , rather than any single factor , was to blame . 
I am convinced , for example , that over the years there has been too much &quot; regulatory capture &quot; by the supply side of the financial services market , with its well-organized and powerful lobbies . 
By contrast , there has been too little engagement on the demand side . 
That is an imbalance of which legislators must be much more conscious . 
A second problem for regulators , supervisors , and , indeed , credit rating agencies was scarce resources . 
When investment banking markets were booming - and the private sector easily recruited up top talent - regulators and supervisors found it difficult to get the budgets to keep up with innovation and police the markets . 
In the future , governments will have to commit the necessary resources to ensure more robust oversight of risk management in financial institutions . 
Capital markets must be subject to much more detailed and frequent hands-on supervisory inspections . 
In Europe , crisis management mechanisms must be put in place to manage their deeply integrated nature , as 80 % of Europe &apos;s banking assets held in cross-border banking groups . 
A third problem - particular relevant to banks , risk managers , and traders - has been misaligned incentives . 
Incentive structures have been overwhelmingly aligned to short-term performance . 
In firms where this was most pronounced , there has been almost total destruction of shareholder value . 
As a consequence , a wholly unacceptable long-term burden has been imposed on taxpayers . 
Privatizing banks &quot; profits and socializing their losses is not acceptable in democratic societies . 
The structure and timing of performance pay in banks must be more closely aligned to long-term shareholder interests and financial stability . 
Incentives for brokers and credit rating agencies have been even more perverse . 
In the United States , brokers were selling mortgages without checking whether the borrower had the means to repay . 
They had no stake beyond the immediate &quot; sale . &quot; 
Financed via Special Purpose Entities , mortgages were parceled up in debt packages and securitized entities in which neither originators nor sponsors retained any material long-term stake but paid credit rating agencies to award a nice little ribbon marked AAA . 
When the packages were unwrapped , most of their contents turned out to consist of pools of toxic assets for which there was no proper due diligence , no evidence of capacity to repay , and little cushion to cope with a market downturn . 
That &apos;s why I have proposed much tougher measures in the revised Capital Requirements Directive amendments now being considered by the European Parliament . 
This will require thorough independent due diligence on securitizations , proper cash-flow sensitivity analysis , and less reliance on credit rating agencies paid by issuers . 
Originators or managers of these securitizations will be required to retain a meaningful stake in each tranche of the issue . 
I was pilloried for this proposal when I initially put it forward . 
I am therefore glad to see that a G-30 advisory group has now supported this principle , and that it is gaining increased traction in the US . 
But some banking industry lobbyists have sought amendments in the European Parliament that would totally neuter the proposal &apos;s effectiveness . 
Even more irresponsible are attempts to undermine a requirement for adequate due diligence on securitization positions prior to investing - with some amendments containing wording that would make it virtually impossible for supervisors to monitor compliance . 
Mortgage assets and leveraged loans created in huckster shops , carved up and buried in &quot; CDO squareds &quot; ( securitizations wrapped in other securitizations ) , and characterized by progressively more obscure , more contingent , and more complex orders of priority for allocating cash flows have no place in capital markets . 
The opaqueness , wholly unnecessary complexity , and near impossibility of undertaking independent due diligence on these structures &quot; underlying risk have undermined trust in the securitization market . 
Financial institutions - and their trade bodies - are doing themselves no favors by vigorously opposing meaningful reform . 
Is it any wonder that the valuation of securitized investments has become so challenging , that mark-to-market valuation on securitized assets has become meaningless , depressed , or both , and that the securitization market itself has seized up ? 
Rather than restoring the trust and confidence in capital markets needed for recovery , those European Union members and banking federations that submitted &quot; wrecking amendments &quot; to the due diligence and securitization proposals are reinforcing the suspicion that is now embedded within them . 
If successful , they will impair the revival of a transparent , responsible , and vibrant securitization market - a market that , if properly managed , can contribute meaningfully to sustainable , long-term economic growth .
