The Disappearing Sky 
Some months ago , an American astronaut accidentally let a tool escape into orbit , eliciting concern about its hazardous potential as a hurtling object that could destroy an expensive satellite or even threaten lives aloft . 
Shortly afterwards , China blew up one of its satellites , immediately doubling the type of fine orbiting debris that is dangerous because it is hard to track . 
Once again the world became aware of the strange situation emerging in our skies . 
The sky is a unique domain , and one that is inadequately regulated . 
With the advent of global pollutions and technologies , remedying this is becoming an increasingly urgent problem . 
In most cases , the laws for skies mirror those governing the world &apos;s oceans . 
Oceans belong to everyone except those near landmasses , which are managed in a similar manner to the country &apos;s land-bound borders . 
As a result , the sky is usually conceptualized in terms of traffic . 
Airliners and fighter planes operate in &quot; controlled &quot; air close to the ground , while nationality is supposed to matter less the higher you go . 
Fragile treaties that cover this are enforced mostly by the fact that few nations can afford to place assets that high . 
But lately , more complex problems are beginning to arise from humanity &apos;s sharing the atmosphere . 
Carbon and fluorocarbons affect everyone &apos;s children . 
When Chernobyl exploded , it was not Ukraine alone that inherited generations of radioactive effects . 
Soon nations will colonize the moon , giving rise to the same unsatisfactory and tentative situation we have in Antarctica , where nations essentially take without legally owning . 
A more enlightened approach to shared resources is needed , one less dependent on neo-colonial control . 
Some suggest that sky governance follow the precedent set by the electromagnetic spectrum . 
The &quot; airwaves &quot; are used for a variety of communications , including government use and public access like radio . 
The range of usable territory - the spectrum - is administered by governments as though it were real estate , and is broken up according to wavelength , with an amount apportioned for cell phones , other bits for military pilots , and so on . 
This situation would be disastrous if it could not be closely managed , because people would broadcast on top of one another . 
Soon , we will see the spectrum become even more active , with the merger of cell phone infrastructure and the relatively unregulated Internet . 
This will likely be followed by more sophisticated means of communications based on access to the air . 
To some extent , everyone will benefit from this , because governments will be less able to censor information . 
But would it be a better model of atmospheric administration ? 
Perhaps not . 
The problem is that at least some electromagnetic waves are dangerous . 
Consider this : at any given moment , the average citizen in the developed world has billions of messages passing through his or her brain . 
It can be shown that cells are able to detect these messages , but the extent to which they affect the body is unknown . 
However , it is known that bees are dying in the northern hemisphere . 
This is a major concern because so much food depends on bees for pollination . 
The primary causes of this recent epidemic are germs and mites , but these have always been with us . 
So why are they affecting bees now ? 
A German study suggests that the proliferation of cell phone towers is weakening bees &quot; immune systems ( the study correlates towers and signal strength to bee deaths ) . 
The jury is still out , but it may be that there is no safe level of exposure to many common radiations ; the more we are exposed , the more damage we do . 
We would see the result of this in indirect effects , such as growing rates of asthma and hyperactivity in children . 
So perhaps the problem with existing regulatory models lies in the assumption that the entire atmosphere is available for unconstrained use . 
We have an intuitive understanding of the importance of limits when the loss of our sky is articulated in poetic terms . 
As light pollution covers more of the planet , we are losing one of our oldest connections to nature : the ancient ability to gaze at the stars . 
If dying bees do not inspire formal guidelines about how the sky should be shared , let us hope that empty space will . 
The sky must belong to the people . 
Abuse of it harms everyone , and profits from its use should benefit all as well , implying the need to establish worldwide democratic rights over what is an unarguably universal resource .
