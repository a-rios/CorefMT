The New / Old Politics of Globalization 
Debates and protests about globalization have been muted since last September &apos;s terrorist attacks . 
But that silence does not mean that they are over . 
Indeed , protests about globalization seem likely to return with more normal times . 
When they do , our understanding of the process will be greater if we look back at history . 
Among historians , globalization provokes a keen sense of déjà vu : we were here a century ago . 
Great achievements - material progress , dizzying new technologies such as the automobile , the telephone , the typewriter - existed back then , but also protests against a world that seemed out of the control of traditional political institutions . 
Then , as now , the backlash came chiefly from rich industrial countries , rather than from poor peripheral countries which were often seen as the objects of capitalist exploitation . 
It was advanced countries that imposed tariffs against &quot; unfair &quot; competition from abroad . 
Central banks were instituted with the responsibility of managing disorderly capital flows . 
Migration policy became more restrictive , as some big recipients of immigration began to debate selectivity in their choice of immigrants . 
The process of integration was reversed after the WWI and finally destroyed in the Great Depression , in a series of vicious shocks : tariff protection , contagious financial panics that spread from the periphery to the heart of the world &apos;s financial system , and a turn to economic nationalism and autarky . 
What had before 1914 been safety nets against excessive globalization became after the WWI gigantic snares which strangled the world economy . 
The most remarkable characteristic of globalization backlashes is how they create an odd alliance of right and left . 
In the late 19th century , Europe &apos;s land-based aristocracy was weakened by the competition of cheap grain and other foods shipped across the oceans . 
As farm prices and rents fell , aristocracy faced decline . 
So it mobilized small-scale farmers , artisans , and small producers who shared the landed elite &apos;s belief that unfettered competition was harmful . 
For these groups , globalization amounted to redistribution . 
On the left , the growing working class sought to use political power to change economic relations - to advance more progressive tax policies , or to stop the use of tariffs to protect the old order . 
Progressives also decried international capitalism &apos;s undermining of labor standards . 
The German sociologist Max Weber made his reputation with warnings of the dire consequences of further Polish immigration to Germany . 
&quot; There is , &quot; he wrote in an echo of today &apos;s globalization debates , &quot; a certain situation of capitalistically disorganized economies , in which the higher culture is not victorious but rather loses in the existential fight with lower cultures . &quot; 
In the center - beleaguered by the anti-global reactions of left and right - a liberal commercial elite saw the products of economic opening or globalization as wholly beneficial . 
Instead of a two part split between left and right , there was thus a triple division , between anti-globalization conservatives , pro-globalization liberals , and re-distributionist leftists . 
When the extremes of the political spectrum became radicalized , as they did in the interwar period - the anti-international right moved to fascism , the left to communism - democratic politics became paralyzed . 
For much of the post-1945 period , these divisions disappeared as right and left fought battles for redistribution within national economies . 
The old triple polarization only returned with the new wave of globalization . 
Again , there is an anti-international right that has come to play some role in all the major industrial countries , and that tries to defend existing prosperity and property rights from the vagaries of international markets . 
The protectionist anti-globalization impetuses of the left are less visible in political parties than in labor movements , but these can shape political programs . 
For unions , the new right is a competitive challenge for support . 
For their members , international competition is a major threat as imports or immigrants may cut the wages of less skilled workers . 
Consequently a demand for the exclusion of the products of &quot; unfair competition &quot; is transmitted to main-stream center-left parties , such as the French Socialists or America &apos;s Democrats . 
Fear of lowered wages plays into a broader coalition based on umbrella anti-globalization resentments directed against multi-national corporations and international financial institutions . 
In the modern center is something similar to the endangered liberal order of late 19th century Europe : the political movement of an elite that espouses globalization because it benefits from it . 
This is the group that cynics have termed &quot; Davos man . &quot; 
It is hardly likely that such a program - presented in these terms - can ever command massive electoral popularity . 
The costs of globalization , and the resentments that it generates , are too obvious . 
This type of party , committed to simple liberalization and opening , rarely moves beyond the range of five to ten percent of the vote that Germany &apos;s liberal Free Democrats attracts . 
When Leszek Balcerowicz &apos;s Freedom Union in Poland won 13 % of the vote in a parliamentary election in 1997 , this represented a stunning success . 
But in Poland &apos;s elections of last year the Freedom Union received less than 5 % of the vote - much closer to a &quot; normal &quot; level of support for a liberal political movement . 
This new politics incites wide feelings of malaise and helplessness . 
The old movements of the 20th century are largely exhausted : classic conservatism because the world changes too rapidly for conservatism as stasis to be coherent or appealing ; classic socialism because the rapidity of change erodes traditional labor positions in exactly the same way . 
The bankruptcy of these two respectable but now out-moded positions opens the door for a new populism , based on an anti-globalization groundswell . 
The new / old politics is inward-looking and likes the idea of the revival of the nation as a protective bulwark against foreign goods and foreign migrants and foreign ownership . 
It is also dangerous and destructive , and was in large part responsible for Europe &apos;s hideous politics in the first half of the 20th century .
