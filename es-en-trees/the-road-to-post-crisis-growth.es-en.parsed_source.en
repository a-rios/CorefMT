The Road to Post-Crisis Growth 
MILAN - It is about 18 months since the financial crisis hit , and 12 months since the panic started to recede , with asset prices stabilizing and beginning to turn up . 
Although recovery in advanced countries remains fragile , developing countries appear to have weathered the storm . 
Growth in China and India is bouncing back toward pre-crisis levels , Brazil &apos;s growth is rising after a sharp dip , and developing-country trade is rebounding from depressed levels . 
Reasons for this remarkable resilience abound , and they offer guidance for advanced and developing countries alike . 
As the crisis struck , capital flowed out of developing countries to shore up damaged balance sheets in advanced countries . 
Credit tightened sharply . 
But rapid responses by developing-country central banks , in collaboration with relatively healthy domestic banks , prevented a severe credit freeze . 
Moreover , the reserves built up over the preceding decade were , in many cases , used to offset some of the capital outflows . 
Bank balance sheets had been strengthened after the 1997-1998 financial crisis , and were unencumbered by the overvalued securitized assets and complex derivative securities that caused much of the damage to advanced-country financial institutions . 
Leverage was lower in several sectors . 
Financial institutions - and , more importantly , households - held less debt relative to assets and income . 
In advanced economies , the main mechanisms for transmitting balance-sheet damage to the real economy were credit rationing and reduced consumption due to loss of net worth in households . 
Both factors were more muted in developing economies . 
Of course , rapid declines in asset values had an impact for a few months , but , with less leverage , the impact on net worth was lower and domestic consumption less vulnerable . 
In sum , the crisis originated in a balance-sheet shock , to which exposure was simply lower in developing countries . 
All developing countries witnessed a huge fall-off in trade - much larger than the declines in income and output . 
Trade bounced back relatively quickly in the second half of 2009 , though this partly reflected the extraordinarily low base . 
But the immediate effect was mitigated to some extent by a sharp depreciation of almost all the currencies caused by the capital outflows . 
The exception was China , where the renminbi held steady against the dollar , causing an initial appreciation against almost every other currency . 
That configuration has largely reversed in the past nine months as international capital flows , driven by investment opportunities and returns , return to a more normal pattern . 
It is likely that China will shortly resume its pre-crisis policy of managed appreciation . 
To be sure , developing countries differed - often markedly - in their capacity for fiscal stimulus to counter the loss of external demand . 
Nevertheless , many were capable of at least some countercyclical measures without destabilizing their public finances . 
Although the resilience in emerging markets , their rapid and effective policy responses , and speedy recoveries are encouraging signs for the global economy , instability in the advanced economies and the relatively unregulated financial system remain a cause for concern . 
Re-regulation and international efforts to coordinate policy responses may eventually reduce the potential for instability , but will require the work to be finished and tested before real confidence is generated . 
In the meantime , a somewhat conservative and defensive posture is warranted . 
This means that developing countries are likely to retain substantial domestic ownership of their domestic financial institutions . 
Securitization ( and shadow banking ) will be kept simple and proceed at a measured pace as a new legal and regulatory framework is built and tested . 
Complex securities that are hard to value will be sharply limited as a matter of policy . 
Moreover , because dependence on foreign finance creates clear vulnerabilities , developing countries will seek to fund investment mainly from domestic savings , thereby limiting the size of their current-account deficits . 
And , because there is no strategic reason to run large surpluses , with an excess of savings over investment , maintaining reasonable balance on the current account appears to be the preferred course . 
In any case , limiting financial interdependence is the prudent strategy and the likely outcome . 
Nevertheless , the basic pillar of sustained high growth has been leveraging the global economy &apos;s knowledge and demand . 
That remains valid . 
So , while a strong likelihood of diminished growth in advanced countries for an extended period means that an outward-oriented strategy may produce less-than-spectacular results for developing countries , alternative strategies are worse . 
Indeed , worries about rising protectionism in a low-growth environment are on target . 
Larger developing countries must assume an expanded role in unwinding the protectionist measures that came with their expanded use of the public purse , and reestablish forward motion . 
This is particularly important for poorer and smaller developing countries in which domestic consumption and investment is a poor substitute for global demand . 
At the same time , a renewed emphasis on maximizing the domestic market &apos;s potential to drive growth and structural diversification - though clearly higher in the larger , higher-income developing economies - is a useful lesson of the crisis . 
Those developing countries that maintain a stable macroeconomic environment , a countercyclical mindset , and steady progress on governance , education , and infrastructure will thrive . 
Advanced-country growth may be diminished for a time , but the compensating factors that have emerged represent the most important lesson of the crisis . 
Developing countries &quot; internal trade is expanding with their economic size , and the large ones are restoring growth rapidly . 
Indeed , China , far from being thrown off course by the crisis , is entering a middle-income transition that over time will create considerable space in labor-intensive manufacturing and services , as the country evolves structurally and exits from these sectors .
