Russia &apos;s Pipeline to Empire 
Gerhard Schroeder , who less than a month ago was Germany &apos;s Chancellor , has agreed to become chairman of the company that is building a gas pipeline from Russia , across the Baltic Sea to Germany , and on through Western Europe . 
In many countries , Schroeder would now be charged with the crime of conflict of interest . 
His apparent ethical lapse is magnified by the fact that , at this very moment , Russia is threatening to cut off Ukraine &apos;s gas supplies if that country does not give in to the pricing demands of Kremlin &apos;s state-owned gas behemoth , Gazprom . 
Russia &apos;s strategic task is obvious : cutting off Ukraine &apos;s gas currently means cutting off much of Europe &apos;s gas as well , because some of its biggest gas pipelines pass through Ukraine . 
By circumventing Ukraine , Poland , and of course , the Baltic countries , the new pipeline promises greater leverage to the Kremlin as it seeks to reassert itself regionally . 
President Vladimir Putin and his administration of ex-KGB clones will no longer have to worry about Western Europe when deciding how hard to squeeze Russia &apos;s postcommunist neighbors . 
Should Europe really be providing Putin with this new imperial weapon ? 
Worse , might Russia turn this weapon on an energy-addicted EU ? 
That a German ex-chancellor is going to lead the company that could provide Russia with a means to manipulate the EU economy is testimony to Europe &apos;s dangerous complacency in the face of Putin &apos;s neo-imperialist ambitions . 
Certainly Russia &apos;s media are aware of Europe &apos;s growing dependence on Russian energy . 
Indeed , they revel in it : after we integrate and increase our common gas business , Russian editorialists write , Europe will keep silent about human rights . 
Putin expresses this stance in a more oblique way with his commitment to pursuing what he calls an &quot; independent policy . &quot; 
What he means by that is that Russia is to be &quot; independent &quot; of the moral and human rights concerns of the Western democracies . 
Perhaps some European leaders really do believe that maintaining the Union &apos;s cozy prosperity justifies silencing ourselves on human rights and other issues that annoy the Kremlin . 
Of course , we may speak up , briefly , about &quot; commercial &quot; matters like the expropriation of Yukos , but if the Kremlin puts a price on our values or criticism of Russian wrongdoing - as in , say , bloodstained Chechnya - Europeans seem willing to shut up rather than face the possibility of higher energy prices , or even a blockade like that now facing Ukraine . 
As Putin shuffles his court , subordinating the Duma to his will , the EU &apos;s hopes for a growing &quot; Europeanization &quot; of Russia should be abandoned . 
The Russia that Putin is building has mutated from the post-Soviet hopes of freedom into an oil and gas bulwark for his new model ex-KGB elite . 
Indeed , Matthias Warnig , the chief executive of the pipeline consortium that Schroeder will chair , is a longtime Putin friend . 
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Warnig , who heads Dresdner Bank &apos;s Russian arm , was an officer in the Stasi , the East German secret police , and met Putin in the late 1980 &quot; s when the Russian president was based in East Germany as a KGB spy . 
That Russians tolerate a government of ex-KGB men , for whom lack of compassion and intolerance of dissent are the norm , reflects their exhaustion from the tumult of the last 20 years . 
Now the Kremlin seems to think that what is good for ordinary Russians is good for independent nations as well : small and weak countries will be shown no mercy once Russia is given the tools to intimidate , isolate , and threaten them with the prospect of an energy blockade . 
As a former Head of State of newly independent Lithuania , I frequently endured such threats . 
The EU has signed numerous agreements with Russia including one for a &quot; common space &quot; for freedom and justice . 
The Kremlin is very good at feigning such idealism . 
Its control of Eastern Europe was always enforced on the basis of &quot; friendship treaties , &quot; and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were &quot; fraternal &quot; missions . 
But look how Putin abuses that &quot; common &quot; space : barbaric treatment of Chechens , the businessmen Mikhail Khodorkovsky imprisoned , foreign NGO &apos;s hounded , a co-leader of last year &apos;s Orange Revolution , Yuliya Tymoshenko , indicted by Russian military prosecutors on trumped-up charges . 
If Europeans are serious about their common space for human rights and freedoms , they must recognize that those values are not shared by the calculating placemen of Putin &apos;s Kremlin . 
The same is true of viewing Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism . 
Is it really conceivable that the homeland of the &quot; Red Terror &quot; with countless unpunished crimes from the Soviet era , and which bears traces of blood from Lithuania to the Caucasus , will provide reliable help in stopping Iran and North Korea from threatening the world ? 
It seems more likely that the Kremlin &apos;s cold minds will merely exploit each crisis as an opportunity to increase their destructive power and influence . 
For decades , my region of Europe was left to the mercy of evil . 
So I cannot sit back in silence as Europe stumbles blindly into a new appeasement . 
We , the new democracies of Eastern Europe , have been taught by our legacy that behind Russia &apos;s every diplomatic act lurks imperial ambition . 
Western Europeans , who have been spared this legacy , should heed our warnings . 
Dependence on Russia - even if its face is now that of the allegedly &quot; charismatic &quot; Gerhard Schroeder - will only lead to an abyss .
