Constitutional Realism in Kenya 
NAIROBI - At long last , Kenya is getting a new constitution , something that had eluded our country for decades , even though almost everyone knew that one was needed . 
That the referendum on the new constitution was voted upon so peacefully - only a few short years since my country was wracked by a violently disputed presidential election - is also worthy of celebration . 
By shunning violence , Kenyans demonstrated emphatically that we can settle our disputes peacefully . 
Kenya &apos;s pursuit of a new constitution has been long and painful . 
When President Mwai Kibaki first ran for election in 2002 , he promised that , if he won , his government would deliver a new constitution within 100 days of taking office . 
Under the leadership of Yash Pal Ghai , a renowned Kenyan legal scholar whose international resum√© includes helping countries like Afghanistan write their constitutions , the Kenyan National Constitution Conference commenced . 
But 100 days later , there was no new constitution . 
Nor was there one 200 days later . 
Days turned into months , and months turned into years . 
By 2004 , the constitutional review process had broken down , owing to major disagreements between Kibaki &apos;s camp in the coalition government , and the rest of the country . 
The Constitution Review Committee was disbanded . 
Following this failed attempt , Kibaki ordered Attorney General Amos Wako to author his government &apos;s version of a new constitution . 
In 2005 , Kibaki called a referendum to vote on Wako &apos;s document . 
The failure to agree on a new constitution fractured the coalition government and divided the country . 
By 2007 , when Kibaki was up for re-election , Kenyans were far less optimistic about their country &apos;s future than when he took office . 
Much of their disenchantment was a result of Kibaki &apos;s failure to keep the promises that he had made in 2002 , among them the delivery of a new constitution . 
When , after the 2007 election , Kibaki was declared the winner under questionable circumstances , Kenyans &quot; patience ran out . 
The country exploded into ethnic violence , leading to the deaths of more than 1,000 people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands more . 
Fortunately , that violence seems to be behind us . 
Today we have a new constitution , and Kenyans are celebrating . 
In the heat of the campaign for the referendum , I think we forgot to ask how replacing the old constitution would change our lives . 
We seem to have thought that the mere act of ratifying a new basic law would instantly end our country &apos;s many problems . 
But Kenyans must not let themselves get too carried away by this political victory ; our country will not change at the stroke of a pen . 
My skepticism ( not pessimism ) comes from looking at Kenya &apos;s law enforcement record . 
Although proponents focused solely on the new document , it doesn &apos;t take a legal scholar to notice that there were good laws under the old constitution that were never enforced . 
One example is the Disability Act of 2003 . 
When enacted , human-rights advocates lauded it as a law that was going to end the suffering of Kenya &apos;s disabled people . 
Seven years later , very few Kenyans with disabilities have benefited . 
One of the most obvious violations of the law is the flouting of Section 23 , which requires all public-transit vehicles to be accessible to disabled people . 
During rush hour in Nairobi , it is nearly impossible for disabled people to get to the city center to work in their tiny businesses , which normally involve selling sweets and polishing shoes near the sidewalks , by public transportation . 
Those disabled people who do not leave the city early are forced to wait until after dusk , when they can get a seat on a bus . 
Meanwhile , the government continues to issue new licenses to vehicles that do not comply with the law . 
And , of course , there is the infamous corruption that has dogged Kenya &apos;s judiciary and police force for years . 
Do we seriously believe that law-enforcement officials and people in other government agencies will stop taking bribes just because Kenyans have approved a new constitution ? 
Kenya &apos;s new constitution won &apos;t have much effect unless we Kenyans take a critical look at ourselves . 
As difficult as the journey to pass the new constitution has been , the ratification process was child &apos;s play when compared to the fight that lies ahead . 
To fulfill the new constitution &apos;s great promise , we will need to change a culture that fosters corruption . 
We can no longer sit back and point fingers at those in government , while at the same time circumventing the law by paying bribes . 
The hard truth is that in many cases both the briber and the bribed are corrupt . 
Corruption flourishes only because most Kenyans give rather than take bribes . 
If we fail to accept that simple fact , come the 2012 elections , we will find ourselves right back where we were after the disputed elections of 2007 .
