Independence or War 
STRASBOURG - In the 1990 &quot; s , the world averted its eyes to genocide in Rwanda , and to the &quot; Great Lakes War &quot; in eastern Congo , which claimed upward of five million lives - the most in any war since World War II . 
Will such silence and neglect prevail again if civil war is renewed in Sudan ? 
The peace deal struck in Naivasha , Kenya in 2005 between Sudan &apos;s government and rebels from the Sudanese People &apos;s Liberation Movement ( SPLM ) committed both sides , at war for most of the previous 50 years , to work for unity . 
A referendum scheduled for January 9 will give voters in the South the opportunity to create their own sovereign state . 
A separate but simultaneous vote in the oil-rich province of Abyei will allow voters to choose if they want to join the North or South . 
The artificial fusion of the mainly Arab , Muslim north of Sudan and the African south , where Christianity and traditional animist beliefs are predominant , has been an abject failure . 
Since Sudan won independence from the United Kingdom in 1956 , the country has been convulsed by almost constant civil war based on the north-south cultural and religious divide . 
Matters were subsequently complicated by a separate conflict - this time between Muslims - over resources in the western Darfur region . 
If the non-Muslim South had gained at independence a large degree of religious , cultural , and administrative autonomy within a devolved federal structure , it is conceivable that the country could have remained at peace . 
For most of the previous half-century , the North sought relentlessly to impose its will on the South . 
Southerners were subject to systematic and institutionalized marginalization . 
Islamization was the main tool of repression , in particular the imposition of Sharia law . 
More than two million people were killed in the second Sudanese civil war alone , which broke out in 1983 ( essentially continuing the first war , which ended in 1972 ) . 
Millions more became refugees . 
Few places on earth are poorer and more destitute than southern Sudan . 
In most places , infrastructure is non-existent and millions of unexploded landmines litter the soil . 
The case for South Sudan &apos;s independence is bolstered by the fact that it would be economically sustainable . 
Some 80 % of Sudan &apos;s oil is in the South , and the country &apos;s vast swaths of fertile , naturally irrigated land hold much promise for commercial agriculture . 
South Sudan &apos;s mineral wealth could also be substantial , though no one knows because exploration has been impossible for so long . 
All polls suggest that , given the choice in a free , fair , and well-organized referendum , southerners will vote overwhelmingly for independence . 
The North has been orchestrating a series of small-scale military strikes on South Sudanese territory in the past few months . 
It is also suspected of drilling horizontally into the South &apos;s oil fields , in defiance of the CPA . 
War , however , is in no one &apos;s interests , not even Bashir &apos;s . 
After all , he relies on oil for government revenue , and , according to recent leaks , is allegedly accumulating a massive personal fortune overseas . 
Bashir knows the tenacity and persistence of the SPLA . 
Renewed conflict could also drag in the United States ( supporting the South ) and China ( Bashir &apos;s key international backer ) into a dangerous and potentially escalating proxy conflict of the kind that was common in Africa throughout the Cold War . 
China has been investing heavily recently in neighboring Ethiopia in the hope of buying neutrality from Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in the event of war , though the government in Addis Ababa is more likely to side with its Christian co-religionists in the South . 
It is the prospect of a proxy war that makes all the unsettled issues - the division of oil revenue , the demarcation of the border , and the fate of the adjoining Nuba Mountains and the Blue Nile region - so potentially explosive . 
An independent South Sudan would force the West to confront established orthodoxies about Africa , in particular the belief that countries like Somalia and Nigeria are more stable whole than they would be in two or more constituent parts . 
Indeed , an independent South Sudan is expected to grant diplomatic recognition to Somaliland , the successful and stable former British protectorate that has had de facto independence from the rest of Somalia since 1991 . 
As Sudan &apos;s referendum approaches , the world holds its breath . 
Undoubtedly , South Sudan would face colossal challenges as a sovereign state , but the alternative - an inevitable return to war - would be incalculably worse , both for Sudan and for Africa . 
The people of South Sudan now have a chance finally to decide their own destiny . 
For them , and for the cause of lasting peace in the region , that could be an immensely valuable start to the new year .
