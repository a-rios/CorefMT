A Year on the Brink 
NEW YORK - The year 2012 turned out to be as bad as I thought . 
The recession in Europe was the predictable ( and predicted ) consequence of its austerity policies and a euro framework that was doomed to fail . 
America &apos;s anemic recovery - with growth barely sufficient to create jobs for new entrants into the labor force - was the predictable ( and predicted ) consequence of political gridlock , which prevented the enactment of President Barack Obama &apos;s jobs bill and sent the economy toward a &quot; fiscal cliff . &quot; 
The two main surprises were the slowdown in emerging markets , which was slightly sharper and more widespread than anticipated , and Europe &apos;s embrace of some truly remarkable reforms - though still far short of what is needed . 
Looking to 2013 , the biggest risks are in the US and Europe . 
By contrast , China has the instruments , resources , incentives , and knowledge to avoid an economic hard landing - and , unlike Western countries , lacks any significant constituency wedded to lethal ideas like &quot; expansionary austerity . &quot; 
The Chinese rightly understand that they must focus more on the &quot; quality &quot; of growth -rebalancing their economy away from exports and toward domestic consumption - than on sheer output . 
But , even with China &apos;s change in focus , and despite adverse global economic conditions , growth of around 7 % should sustain commodity prices , thereby benefiting exports from Africa and Latin America . 
A third round of quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve could help commodity exporters as well , even if it does little to promote US domestic growth . 
The US , with Obama re-elected , is likely to muddle on , much as it has for the past four years . 
Inklings of recovery in the real-estate market will be enough to discourage dramatic policy measures , like a write-down of principal on &quot; underwater &quot; mortgages ( where the outstanding loan exceeds the market value of the house ) . 
But , with real ( inflation-adjusted ) house prices still 40 % below the previous peak , a strong recovery for real estate ( and the closely related construction industry ) seems unlikely . 
Meanwhile , even if Obama &apos;s Republican opponents do not push the country over the fiscal cliff of automatic tax increases and spending cuts on January 1 , they will ensure that America &apos;s own form of mild austerity will continue . 
Public-sector employment is now roughly 600,000 below its pre-crisis level , while normal expansion would have meant 1.2 million additional jobs , implying a public-sector jobs deficit of almost two million . 
But the real risk for the global economy is in Europe . 
Spain and Greece are in depression , with no hope of recovery in sight . 
The eurozone &apos;s &quot; fiscal compact &quot; is no solution , and the European Central Bank &apos;s purchases of sovereign debt are at most a temporary palliative . 
If the ECB imposes further austerity conditions ( as it seems to be demanding of Greece and Spain ) in exchange for financing , the cure will only worsen the patient &apos;s condition . 
Likewise , common European banking supervision will not suffice to prevent the continuing exodus of funds from the afflicted countries . 
That requires an adequate common deposit-insurance scheme , which the northern European countries have said is not in the cards anytime soon . 
While European leaders have repeatedly done what previously seemed unthinkable , their responses have been out of synch with markets . 
They have consistently underestimated their austerity programs &quot; adverse effects and overestimated the benefits of their institutional adjustments . 
The impact of the ECB &apos;s â‚¬ 1 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) long-term refinancing operation ( LTRO ) , which loaned money to commercial banks to buy sovereign bonds ( a bootstrap operation that seemed as peculiar as the ECB &apos;s financing of sovereigns to shore up the banks ) , was impressively short-lived . 
Europe &apos;s leaders have recognized that the debt crisis in the periphery will only worsen in the absence of growth , and they have even ( sometimes ) recognized that austerity will not help on that front ; nonetheless , they have failed to deliver an effective growth package . 
The depression that European authorities have imposed on Spain and Greece already is having political consequences . 
In Spain , independence movements , especially in Catalonia , have revived , while neo-Nazism is on the march in Greece . 
The euro , created for the avowed purpose of fostering the integration of a democratic Europe , is having precisely the opposite effect . 
The lesson is that politics and economics are inseparable . 
Markets on their own may be neither efficient nor stable , but the politics of deregulation gave scope to unprecedented excesses that led to asset bubbles and the rolling crisis that has followed their collapse . 
And the politics of crisis has led to responses that are far from adequate . 
Banks have been saved , but the underlying problems were left to fester - no surprise there , given that , in both Europe and America , the task of fixing them was assigned to the policymakers who had caused them . 
In Europe , it was politics , not economics , that drove the creation of the euro ; and it was politics that led to a fundamentally flawed structure that created ample room for bubbles , but little scope for dealing with the aftermath . 
To forecast 2013 is to predict how divided government in the US and a divided Europe respond to their respective crises . 
Economists &quot; crystal balls are always cloudy , but those of political scientists are even cloudier . 
That said , the US will probably muddle through another year , neither pushed over the cliff nor put on the road to robust recovery . 
But , on both sides of the Atlantic , the polarized politics of bravado and brinkmanship will be much in evidence . 
The problem with brinkmanship is that , sometimes , one does go over the brink .
