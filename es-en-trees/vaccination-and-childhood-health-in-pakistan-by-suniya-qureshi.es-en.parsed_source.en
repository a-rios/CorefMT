Pakistan &apos;s Winnable War on Polio 
LAHORE - I grew up in Pakistan throughout the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , and my parents , like parents everywhere , wanted me to be fit and healthy and to get the best start in life . 
I was lucky enough to be brought up in a middle-class family with good sanitation facilities and clean water . 
I was also given vaccines to prevent life-threatening infections such as polio and measles . 
But I remember the many children in my neighborhood who were not vaccinated . 
Those early experiences of children I knew contracting disease , especially the poliovirus that is so visibly impairing , shaped my views on the immense value of good health and the power of vaccines . 
I live in London now , but my roots will always be in Pakistan . 
As head of the British Pakistan Foundation , I help philanthropists from the Pakistani diaspora invest in sustainable and effective social development projects . 
Over the last few weeks , I have been in my hometown of Lahore , the country &apos;s second-largest city , discussing everything from the upcoming elections to everyday life challenges . 
Last week , I visited an orphanage on the outskirts of the city , set up after the 2005 earthquake that killed an estimated 75,000 people . 
I was impressed and encouraged that roughly four-fifths of the 85 children were fully vaccinated . 
National statistics on immunization back up the positive signs that I saw . 
In 1994 , Pakistan had roughly 25,000 cases of polio , many resulting in death or permanent disability . 
But , thanks to intensive vaccination campaigns , there were only 58 cases of polio in the entire country last year - down 70 % from 2011 . 
And the government and international health officials have agreed on a plan to stop polio transmission in Pakistan completely by the end of 2014 - a historic accomplishment that would be a huge source of national pride . 
The main driver of Pakistan &apos;s dramatic reduction in polio cases over the last two decades has been leadership at all levels . 
In 1994 , Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto launched the first national vaccination drive by inoculating her baby daughter , Aseefa . 
Nineteen years later , Aseefa is Pakistan &apos;s Goodwill Ambassador on Polio Eradication and a powerful advocate of completing her mother &apos;s dream of a polio-free country . 
International public-private partnerships and an army of vaccinators are working on the frontlines to protect every last child . 
Collectively , we are helping children and communities once considered unreachable . 
With the recent progress on polio , Pakistan has a blueprint for future public-health interventions . 
In fact , we are already seeing the new framework take shape . 
For example , vitamin A drops - which provide infants with an essential micronutrient for vision and healthy growth - are now delivered twice yearly in conjunction with polio vaccines . 
Moreover , last year Pakistan became the first country in the region to introduce the latest vaccine to protect children against pneumonia . 
With pneumonia accounting for a shockingly high 20 % of child deaths each year in Pakistan , widespread access to the new vaccine should have a major impact . 
Major challenges remain . 
According to UNICEF , Pakistan has the second-highest rate of child mortality in South Asia . 
There is an important debate taking place in our country about how best to organize the health-care system so that it is accountable for serving the poorest and most marginalized communities . 
The size of the challenges that we face was made clear at the beginning of this year , when a measles outbreak killed more than 300 children in Pakistan - most of whom had not received vaccines . 
Just this month , we learned the tragic news that a guard accompanying health workers was killed during an immunization drive . 
But we will not be deterred . 
Those who advocate violence are a minority in Pakistan , and will not stand in the way of our people &apos;s betterment . 
With the upcoming elections , we have a valuable opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to vaccines by strengthening national leadership on health and increasing investment in the health-care system . 
And , as I heard from the guardians at the orphanage , educating communities about the value of vaccines and mobilizing their support is critical for reaching every last child . 
The cooperation of the Pakistani diaspora movement and international donors like the Islamic Development Bank ( which in March signed a financing package of $ 227 million to fight polio in Pakistan ) , together with the vaccinators &quot; determination to reach all of the country &apos;s children , is inspirational . 
It is also changing lives for the better . 
With continued support for vital vaccines from Pakistan &apos;s government and people , I am hopeful that the next time I return home , there will be even more reasons to be optimistic about our children &apos;s future .
