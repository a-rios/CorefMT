The Humanities Crisis 
NEW YORK - A striking symmetry is emerging in debates about the future of higher education around the world . 
On the one hand , there is growing concern that the United States and many European countries are failing to prepare enough university graduates in the fields driving the twenty-first century &quot; knowledge economy , &quot; such as engineering and information technology . 
This fear has led to the narrowing of the concept of education to mean the acquisition of practical skills . 
On the other hand , the worry in some parts of Asia is that young people entering the work force with strong technical training lack sufficient experience &quot; thinking outside the box . &quot; 
This fear is manifesting itself in an incipient effort to expand education to include the cultivation of feeling and imagination . 
Both movements are rooted in economic concerns . 
In the US , where most undergraduates bear at least part of the cost of their university education , political pressure is mounting to provide incentives like tuition discounts or loan forgiveness to students of science , technology , engineering , or mathematics ( the so-called STEM fields ) . 
Cost-cutting measures , such as compressing traditional four-year degree programs into three years - thereby reducing or eliminating elective courses in &quot; impractical &quot; subjects like literature , philosophy , and fine arts - are also being discussed . 
Meanwhile , in Hong Kong , Singapore , and China , there are calls for extending university programs so that students can obtain a broad , liberal education , in the hope that graduates will be more inclined to experiment and innovate . 
Hong Kong University , for example , has extended its undergraduate programs from three years to four . 
But such a narrow , economics-based view fails to account for the larger questions of value that societies worldwide are facing . 
To be sure , progress in any field , from commerce and communications to health and environmental science , will become increasingly dependent on technological innovation , and thus on the high-order skills - acquired through intensive technical training - that drive it . 
It is also true , however , that such training does not provide an adequate foundation for addressing the more abstract , but profoundly important , questions that ultimately must guide global policy and decision-making . 
For example : 
· How can the imperative of economic development be reconciled with the need to limit climate change ? 
· What does national sovereignty mean in a world where diseases , pollutants , and terrorists cross national borders at will ? 
· Are there universal human rights that transcend conflicting claims of particular cultural traditions ? 
· How should limited resources be distributed in order to provide opportunity and hope to young people , while treating the elderly with dignity and respect ? 
· What are a country &apos;s obligations to refugees fleeing from persecution , poverty , or strife elsewhere ? 
· How should we balance individual liberty and collective security ? 
In answering such questions , advances in science and technology ( for example , new methods of energy production , surveillance , or online learning ) will have a key role to play . 
But moral and ethical questions never yield fully to technical solutions ; they also require an understanding of humanity &apos;s social and cultural heritage . 
Science can help us to attain the life we want , but it cannot teach us what kind of life is worth wanting . 
In short , each side in the current education debate is half right . 
As human affairs become increasingly complex and morally exigent , future generations will need both scientific and humanistic learning - and they will need them more than ever . 
Fortunately , promising new models for making education more coherent and capacious are emerging . 
Yale University and the National University of Singapore have worked together to establish Yale-NUS , Singapore &apos;s first liberal arts college . 
Led by a literary scholar and an astronomer , this new residential college aims to break down interdisciplinary boundaries and enable students to learn from one another . 
Likewise , Quest University in Canada encourages students to bring both scientific and humanistic knowledge to bear on today &apos;s most pressing problems . 
Similar efforts have been underway for years in the US . 
For example , North Carolina State University &apos;s Benjamin Franklin Scholars program - a collaboration between the College of Engineering and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences - aims &quot; to produce well-rounded professionals who are analytical problem-solvers , ethical decision-makers , and effective communicators . &quot; 
Unfortunately , such programs largely lack the visibility and influence needed to shape educational reform . 
It is time to abandon the &quot; either / or &quot; discourse that pits science against humanities - which the British chemist and novelist C.P. Snow identified more than a half-century ago as an obstacle to human progress . 
It is time to seek out best practices that bridge this putative divide , and scale them up . 
In the important work of adapting educational institutions for the future , we must not lose sight of their core mission as articulated in the past . 
No one has expressed that mission better than Benjamin Franklin , a man of letters and a scientific innovator , who defined education as the quest for &quot; true merit . &quot; 
&quot; True merit , &quot; Franklin wrote , consists in &quot; an inclination joined with an ability to serve mankind , one &apos;s country , friends , and family ; which ability is ... to be acquired or greatly increased by true learning ; and should , indeed , be the great aim and end of all learning . &quot; 
This is an aspiration that should be renewed for every generation .
