The Path to Altruism 
SHECHEN , NEPAL - &quot; Cooperation , &quot; the Harvard University biologist Martin Nowak has written , is &quot; the architect of creativity throughout evolution , from cells to multicellular creatures to anthills to villages to cities . &quot; 
As mankind now tries to solve new , global challenges , we must also find new ways to cooperate . 
The basis for this cooperation must be altruism . 
The desire to help others without consideration for ourselves is not just a noble ideal . 
Selflessness raises the quality and elevates the meaning of our lives , and that of our descendants ; in fact , our very survival may even depend on it . 
We must have the insight to recognize this , and the audacity to say so . 
Humanity faces three monumental challenges : ensuring everyone decent living conditions , improving life satisfaction , and protecting our planet . 
Traditional cost-benefit analysis struggles to reconcile these demands , because they span different time frames . 
We worry about the state of the economy from year to year ; but we consider our happiness over the course of a lifetime , while our concern for the environment will mainly benefit future generations . 
But an altruistic approach requires few trade-offs . 
A considerate investor will never speculate recklessly with his clients &quot; life savings , despite the potential gain for himself . 
A caring citizen will always think first how his actions affect his community . 
A selfless generation will exercise care with the planet , precisely in order to leave a livable world to its children . 
This vision of the world may seem idealistic . 
After all , psychology , economics , and evolutionary biology have often claimed that humans share an essentially selfish nature . 
But research over the past 30 years indicates that true altruism does exist and can extend beyond kin and community to encompass the welfare of humans generally - and that of other species . 
Moreover , the altruist does not have to suffer for his good deeds ; on the contrary , he often benefits indirectly from them , while the selfish actor often creates misery for himself as well as others . 
Studies have also shown that an individual can learn to be altruistic . 
Neuroscientists have identified three components of altruism that anyone can develop as acquired skills : empathy ( understanding and sharing the feelings of another ) , loving kindness ( the wish to spread happiness ) , and compassion ( a desire to relieve the suffering of another ) . 
Societies , too , can become more altruistic ( and may even enjoy an evolutionary advantage over their more selfish counterparts ) . 
Research on the evolution of cultures suggests that human values can change more quickly than our genes . 
Thus , if we are to engender a more caring world , we must first recognize the importance of altruism - and then cultivate it among individuals and promote cultural change in our societies . 
Nowhere is the need to cultivate this recognition clearer than it is in our economic system . 
The unrealistic pursuit of endless quantitative growth places intolerable strains on our planet and widens inequalities . 
But reversing that growth would create other problems ; forcing people to compete for diminishing assets and resources would spread unemployment , poverty , and even violence . 
So a balance must be struck : the global community must lift 1.5 billion people out of poverty , while the excesses of the world &apos;s richest consumers - which cause the vast majority of ecological degradation - must be limited . 
We need not impose more taxes to achieve this , but we can persuade the wealthy that the eternal pursuit of material gain is both unsustainable and unnecessary for their own quality of life . 
This concept of &quot; sustainable harmony &quot; can be promoted by publishing indices of personal well-being and environmental preservation , alongside standard GDP data . 
The government of Bhutan , for example , already accounts for the &quot; social wealth &quot; and &quot; natural wealth &quot; of its people , in addition to its GDP figures . 
We could also establish a stock exchange , alongside traditional securities markets , comprising so-called ethical organizations , such as social enterprises , cooperative banks , microcredit agencies , and fair-trade groups . 
Several initiatives - for example , in Brazil , South Africa , and the United Kingdom - have already taken small steps in this direction . 
Small steps lead to big changes . 
As the value of altruism becomes increasingly obvious , the new approach will spread through the economy , benefiting all of society , future generations , and the planet , too .
