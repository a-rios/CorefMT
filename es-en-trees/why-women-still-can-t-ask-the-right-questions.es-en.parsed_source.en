Why Women Still Can &apos;t Ask the Right Questions 
NEW YORK - We are just recovering , in the United States , from the entirely predictable kerfuffle over a plaint published by Anne-Marie Slaughter , former Director of Policy Planning at the State Department and a professor at Princeton University , called &quot; Why Women Still Can &apos;t Have it All . &quot; 
The response was predictable because Slaughter &apos;s article is one that is published in the US by a revolving cast of powerful ( most often white ) women every three years or so . 
The article , whoever has written it , always bemoans the &quot; myth &quot; of a work-life balance for women who work outside the home , presents the glass ceiling and work-family exhaustion as a personal revelation , and blames &quot; feminism &quot; for holding out this elusive &quot; having-it-all ideal . &quot; 
And it always manages to evade the major policy elephants in the room - which is especially ironic in this case , as Slaughter was worn out by crafting policy . 
The problems with such arguments are many . 
For starters , the work-family balance is no longer a women &apos;s issue . 
All over the developed world , millions of working men with small children also regret the hours that they spend away from them , and go home to bear the brunt of shared domestic tasks . 
This was a &quot; women &apos;s issue &quot; 15 years ago , perhaps , but now it is an ambient tension of modern life for a generation of women and men who are committed to gender equality . 
Such arguments also ignore the fact that affluent working women and their partners overwhelmingly offload the work-family imbalance onto lower-income women - overwhelmingly women of color . 
One can address how to be an ethical , sustainable employer of such caregivers ; nannies in New York and other cities are now organizing to secure a system of market-pegged wages , vacation time , and sick days . 
Moreover , an inflexible and family-unfriendly corporate environment is no longer the only choice for working women . 
Many , particularly in the US , have left that world to start their own businesses . 
Most importantly , Americans have a remarkable tendency to reduce problems that others addressed through public policy to a matter of private &quot; choice &quot; and even personal psychology . 
In Canada , couples with a baby may sequence six-month leaves of absence at up to 90 % pay . 
In the Netherlands - the best scenario I have seen yet - families can take a day off each week , and the government subsidizes full-time daycare . 
This solution was not framed as a &quot; women &apos;s issue , &quot; but as a family benefit . 
And Dutch women have simply moved on , focusing on other interesting goals in their personal and family lives . 
In America , by contrast , the Chamber of Commerce and other business interests lobby hard to keep politicians from ever proposing such solutions . 
They know that billions of dollars are made from hiring women at lower income levels than men , and then ensuring that a work-family conflict derails women &apos;s careers before they become too expensive to compensate fairly . 
Of course , Europe is not gender-equality Nirvana . 
In particular , the corporate workplace will never be completely family-friendly until women are part of senior management decisions , and Europe &apos;s top corporate-governance positions remain overwhelmingly male . 
Indeed , women hold only 14 % of positions on European corporate boards . 
The European Union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women - up to 60 % . 
This proposed mandate was born of frustration . 
Last year , European Commission Vice President Viviane Reding issued a call to voluntary action . 
Reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goals of 40 % female board membership . 
The Forte foundation in America has now followed suit with its own list of &quot; board-ready women . &quot; 
Do we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate ladder fairly as they balance work and family ? 
&quot; Personally , I don &apos;t like quotas , &quot; Reding said recently . 
Quotas get action : they &quot; open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling , &quot; according to Reding , a result seen in France and other countries with legally binding provisions on placing women in top business positions . 
I understand Reding &apos;s reticence - and her frustration . 
I don &apos;t like quotas either ; they run counter to my belief in meritocracy . 
After all , four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as well as the US are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top positions - no matter how much &quot; soft pressure &quot; is put upon them . 
When women do break through to the summit of corporate power - as , for example , Sheryl Sandberg recently did at Facebook - they garner massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule . 
If appropriate public policies were in place to help all women - whether CEOs or their children &apos;s caregivers - and all families , Sandberg would be no more newsworthy than any other highly capable person living in a more just society .
