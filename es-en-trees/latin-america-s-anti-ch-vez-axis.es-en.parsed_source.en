Latin America &apos;s Anti-Chávez Axis 
BRUSSELS - The rescue of Ingrid Betancourt and 14 other hostages who had been held for years by FARC guerrillas marks more than a turning point in Colombia &apos;s long war against its drug-running , Marxist guerrillas . 
It also confirms the emergence of a new troika of Latin American leaders - Colombia &apos;s President Alvaro Uribe , Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , and Mexican President Felipe Calderón - who are set on finishing off Latin America &apos;s destabilizing drug cartels and guerrilla movements , as well as isolating the region &apos;s demagogic upstart , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez . 
Uribe &apos;s status as one of Latin America &apos;s historic leaders was assured even before the rescue of Betancourt and the other hostages . 
Uribe won an unprecedented re-election two years ago with an absolute majority in the first round of the vote . 
But it is Uribe &apos;s resolve not to negotiate with the FARC over kidnappings , and instead to pursue relentlessly the armed insurgency that murdered his father that has defined Uribe &apos;s presidency . 
In the process , he transformed a country that was in the grip of drug barons and on the verge of becoming a failed state . 
The professionalism of Colombia &apos;s armed forces , coupled with Uribe &apos;s popularity and a growing economy , has delivered , for the first time in three decades , normality to Colombia &apos;s cities and , increasingly , peace and the rule of law to much of its vast jungle regions . Uribe &apos;s relentlessness has brought on waves of defections from the FARC , which is now down to 9,000 guerrillas from a peak of 16,000 in 2001 . 
Indeed , many FARC defectors now prefer to fight for their cause at the ballot box under the new left-wing Polo Alternativo Democratico . 
But the benefits of Uribe &apos;s apparent defeat of the FARC extend far beyond Colombia . 
The hostage rescue mission has also forced Chávez , still recovering from his failed power-grab referendum of last year ( a moment when Chávez &apos;s own army high command allegedly refused his demand to fudge the result ) onto the defensive . 
The Uribe-Lula-Calderón axis appears set on keeping him there . 
Chávez is the loser not only because he had provided the FARC moral support ( he once described them as &quot; belligerents , &quot; not terrorists , and publicly called Uribe an American stooge ) , but also because it is believed that he has been providing the FARC covert military support . 
There were serious grounds over the last three years to believe that Latin America was going through one of its regular bouts of left-wing destabilization , given the rise of Bolivian President Evo Morales , Ecuador &apos;s President Rafael Correa , and their ringleader , Chávez . 
But the recent worldwide increase in commodity prices has meant that the traditional regional powerhouses of Chile , Brazil , and Mexico have experienced economic booms of their own . 
This made it easier for Lula in particular to buck his socialist allies and distance himself from Chávez , having as recently as March 2008 backed Chávez following Colombia &apos;s brief incursion into Ecuador which killed FARC Commander Raul Reyes . 
Calderón &apos;s uncompromising hard line on drug dealers in Mexico , an unrelenting offensive that follows the precedent set by Uribe in dealing with the FARC , has also been helped because economic growth has muted domestic opposition . 
The emerging Uribe-Lula-Calderón troika has geo-strategic influence because things have started to change in Cuba ever since Fidel Castro formally handed over the presidency to his brother , Raúl . 
Latin America is obsessed with this transition , and Uribe , Calderón , and Lula have no intention of letting Chávez lead the way . 
Last January , Lula visited the island with a string of leading Brazilian businessmen and signed trade and investment deals worth $ 1 billion . 
Calderón , reversing his predecessor &apos;s policy of speaking out against the lack of human rights in Cuba , has restored Mexico &apos;s traditional close ties . 
Earlier this year , Mexico &apos;s foreign minister renegotiated $ 400 million of debt on which Cuba had defaulted . 
Cultural exchanges have increased , and Calderón is expected to visit Havana soon . 
This closer embrace of Cuba mixes self-interest with calculation . 
Everywhere in Latin America , Cuba is a domestic political issue . 
Some commentators argue that in repairing relations , Uribe , Calderón , and Lula hope to mollify their left-wing opponents . 
Moreover , for both Uribe and Calderón , instability in Cuba could pose a domestic security threat . 
Both Brazil and Mexico see business opportunities on the island , especially since Raúl Castro has already made Cuba more open to foreign investment . 
But perhaps the most important reason for improving relations with Cuba is one that none of the three leaders will say in public : they see closer ties as a way of balancing the influence of Chávez , who has replaced the Soviet Union as Cuba &apos;s main provider of aid . 
Unlike Chávez , Fidel &apos;s fawning disciple , Uribe , Calderón , and Lula are quietly supporting political liberalization in Cuba , and believe that Raúl Castro also worries about Cuba &apos;s dependence on Venezuela , as well as on China . 
Some in the Bush administration accept this argument , saying that they are happy to see Latin American democracies seeking influence where the United States cannot . Latin America , it seems , is no longer held hostage by its demagogues and guerrillas .
