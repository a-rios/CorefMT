&quot; Never Again &quot; in Kenya ? 
NAIROBI - As Kenya approaches its general election on March 4 , memories of the bloodshed that marred the controversial 2007 presidential election remain fresh . 
The vote ended in a standoff between the incumbent , Mwai Kibaki , who declared himself the winner , and the opposition candidate , Raila Odinga , who dismissed the vote as rigged . 
The ensuing ethnic clashes claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people , and displaced another 250,000 . 
The violence ended only after former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan helped to broker a power-sharing agreement in which Kibaki retained the presidency and Odinga became Prime Minister . 
When the agreement was signed , many Kenyans declared that such politically charged ethnic violence would &quot; never again &quot; consume Kenya . 
But , less than three months before the next election , few remain confident that such violence will not recur - especially given that Kenya &apos;s government has taken no measures to prevent it . 
This is not surprising , given Kenya &apos;s poor record of prosecuting war crimes . 
In the run-up to Kenya &apos;s first multi-party election in 1992 , ethnic clashes caused hundreds of deaths , and displaced an estimated 300,000 people . 
Ethnic violence marred the 1997 election as well . 
Yet , while few dispute that politicians incited and even coordinated the violence , none was ever brought to justice . 
The 2007 violence was unique in the sense that it did not begin in smaller cities , towns , or rural areas , but in the capital , Nairobi , bringing Kenya to a standstill and turning it into a focus of international attention . 
The United States sent then-Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer to intervene - the first time a high-ranking American officer was sent to mediate in an African conflict . 
But it is increasingly clear that Kenyans &quot; pronouncements of &quot; never again &quot; were little more than an expression of relief . 
Now , action must be taken to avoid renewed violence ; the politicians who incited and funded the bloodshed must be held accountable . 
Despite its failure to investigate the conflict &apos;s root causes , the International Criminal Court has charged four senior Kenyan officials with crimes against humanity : Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta , the former cabinet secretary Francis Muthaura , the former education minister William Ruto , and the radio executive Joshua arap Sang . 
Charges against two other officials , former Police Commissioner Mohammed Hussein Ali and Minister for Industrialization Henry Kosgey , were dropped , with the remaining four to face trial beginning in April 2013 . 
Until then , however , it is business as usual - which includes one of the accused , Kenyatta , vying for the presidency . 
Given that Kenya &apos;s previous constitution was considered partly responsible for the violence , a new constitution was adopted in 2010 , with the support of 67 % of the population . 
But an updated constitution cannot instantly transform a country &apos;s politics and society . 
In fact , the old Kenyan constitution underpinned legislation that , if enforced , would have addressed some of the factors that fuel violence . 
For example , the Environmental Management and Coordination Act of 1999 stipulates that every Kenyan is entitled to live in a clean environment . 
If this right is violated , citizens may petition the courts to compel violators to desist , and to pay to repair the damage . 
But , as the highly polluted Nairobi River demonstrates , the law has never been enforced . 
More than two years since the new constitution was adopted , little has changed . 
The root causes of the 2007 violence - rampant poverty , significant income inequality , pervasive corruption , inadequate internal security , and an unemployment rate exceeding 40 % - remain . 
Moreover , Kenyans have made little effort to mend relations between ethnic groups . 
Last year alone , ethnic clashes in the Tana River District killed more than 100 people . 
And the level and tone of political debate - for example , within Facebook groups created by presidential candidates or their supporters - are worrying . 
Many participants make simplistic , ethnocentric statements like , &quot; Kikuyus should never rule Kenya again &quot; ( Kenyatta is a member of the dominant Kikuyu tribe ) . 
Likewise , when cattle rustlers recently killed dozens of police officers in northern Kenya , the media described the suspects in terms of their Turkana descent , rather than calling them what they are : criminals . 
Unless all Turkana people are homicidal cattle rustlers , how does such stereotyping advance the cause of professional journalism , much less promote tolerance in Kenya ? 
The only part of the new constitution that Kenyans have been quick to implement directly pertains to elections . 
This year , in addition to electing a president and members of parliament , voters will elect senators , county governors , and other political leaders . 
Moreover , for the first time a run-off will be required if no candidate emerges from the first round of the presidential election with at least 50 % of the national vote and 25 % of the vote in 24 counties . 
While such reforms - which give citizens more power by establishing semi-autonomous local governments - are crucial , the underlying motivation is the creation of more legislative positions . 
In Kenya , such offices translate into instant wealth for the winners . 
Indeed , given that Kenya &apos;s lawmakers are some of the world &apos;s highest-paid politicians , earning many times the salary of counterparts in much wealthier countries , they are willing to do anything - even incite violence - to be elected . 
There is little doubt that the new sinecures will benefit only Kenya &apos;s wealthiest . 
Meanwhile , nothing has been done to appease the millions of poor Kenyans who are likely to heed a politician &apos;s exhortation to kill . 
With Election Day less than three months away , citizens can only hope that the new constitution created enough electoral vacancies to satisfy their politicians &quot; bloody lust for power .
