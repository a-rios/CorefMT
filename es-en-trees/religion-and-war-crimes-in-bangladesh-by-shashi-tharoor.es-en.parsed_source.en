Bangladesh &apos;s Quest for Justice 
NEW DELHI - The sea of humanity besieging the Shahbag area in the Bangladeshi capital , Dhaka , for the last two months , has had an unusual demand - unusual , at least , for the Indian subcontinent . 
The demonstrators have been clamoring for justice for the victims of the genocidal massacres of 1971 that led to the former East Pakistan &apos;s secession from Pakistan . 
The demonstrations have been spontaneous , disorganized , and chaotic , but also impassioned and remarkably peaceful . 
Many of the several thousand demonstrators at Shahbag are too young to have had personal experience of the killings that marked the Pakistani Army &apos;s brutal , and ultimately unsuccessful , attempt to suppress the fledgling independence movement . 
But they are animated by an ideal - the profound conviction that complicity in mass murder should not go unpunished , and that justice is essential for Bangladeshi society &apos;s four-decade-old wounds to heal fully . 
What is curious about this development is that the subcontinent has preferred to forget the monstrous injustices that have scarred its recent history . 
A million people lost their lives in the savagery of the subcontinent &apos;s partition into India and Pakistan , and 13 million more were displaced , most forcibly . 
But not one person was ever charged with a crime , much less tried and punished . 
An estimated million more were massacred in Bangladesh in 1971 , and only this year have some of the perpetrators &quot; local allies been tried . 
Almost every year , somewhere on the subcontinent , riots , often politically instigated , claim dozens - sometimes hundreds and occasionally thousands - of lives in the name of religion , sect , or ethnicity . 
Again , investigations are conducted and reports are written , but no one is ever brought before the bar of justice . 
To paraphrase Stalin : The intentional killing of one person is murder , but that of a hundred , a thousand , or a million is merely a grim statistic . 
The idealism of Bangladesh &apos;s young demonstrators , however , points to a new development . 
The outpouring of emotion evident at Shahbag was provoked by a decision of an international criminal tribunal convened by the government . 
The tribunal , which tries cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity , found a prominent member of Bangladesh &apos;s largest Islamist political party , Jamaat-e-Islami , guilty of complicity in the killings of 300 people , but gave him a relatively light sentence of 15 years in prison ( prosecutors had sought the death penalty ) . 
By demanding severe punishment for those guilty of war crimes - not the Pakistani Army , long gone , but their local collaborators in groups like Jamaat-e-Islami , Al Badar , Al Shams , and the Razakar irregulars - the protesters are also implicitly describing the society in which they wish to live : secular , pluralist , and democratic . 
These words are enshrined in Bangladesh &apos;s constitution , which simultaneously declares the Republic to be an Islamic State . 
While some see no contradiction , the fact that many of the collaborators who killed secular and pro-democracy Bengalis in 1971 claimed to be doing so in the name of Islam points to an evident tension . 
If any proof of this clash of values were needed , it came in the form of a hugely impressive counter-demonstration against the Shahbag movement led by activists of the fundamentalist Islamic movement Hifazat-e-Islam , which occupied the capital &apos;s Motijheel area . 
Unlike the Shahbag events , the counter-demonstration was well-planned and organized , and conveyed the stark message that there was an alternative point of view in this overwhelmingly Muslim country . 
The male , bearded , skull-cap-wearing protesters shouted in unison their agreement with speakers who denounced the International Crimes Tribunal . 
Their supporters include activists of the Harkat-ul-Jihad-Al-Islami-Bangladesh , which has fought alongside the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan . 
The debate between religious fundamentalism and secular democracy is not a new one on the subcontinent . 
But the issue of justice for the crimes of 1971 has brought the divide into sharp relief . 
The Shahbag protesters reject Islamic extremists &quot; influence in Bangladesh , and even call for organizations like Jamaat-e-Islami to be banned , while Hifazat-e-Islam and its supporters want the country &apos;s liberal forces repressed , secularist bloggers arrested , and strict Islamism imposed on Bangladeshi society . 
The young people at Shahbag are mainly urban , educated , and middle class ; 
Hifazat derives its support mainly from the rural poor . 
Traditional versus modern , urban versus rural , intellectuals versus the peasantry : these divisions are the stuff of political cliché . 
But , all too often , clichés become established because they are true . 
The Bangladeshi government &apos;s sympathies are closer to the Shahbag protesters than to the Hifazat counter-demonstrators . 
But it must navigate a difficult path , because both points of view have significant public support . 
The authorities have even taken steps to appease the Islamists by arresting four bloggers for their posts . 
But the government remains resolute in its support for the international tribunal . 
The irony is that true religion is never incompatible with justice . 
But when justice is sought for the crimes of those who claim to be acting in the name of religion , the terms of the debate change . 
The issue then becomes one that has been avoided in Bangladesh for too long : whether claiming to act according to the requirements of piety provides an exemption for murder . 
The outcome of the standoff in Dhaka should provide an answer in Bangladesh , and its implications could reverberate far and wide .
