Dear World , Please Confront America 
Is it possible to fall out of love with your own country ? 
For two years , I , like many Americans , have been focused intently on documenting , exposing , and alerting the nation to the Bush administration &apos;s criminality and its assault on the Constitution and the rule of law - a story often marginalized at home . 
I was certain that when Americans knew what was being done in their name , they would react with horror and outrage . 
Three months ago , the Bush administration still clung to its devil &apos;s sound bite , &quot; We don &apos;t torture . &quot; 
Now , Physicians for Human Rights has issued its report documenting American-held detainees &quot; traumas , and even lie detector tests confirm they have been tortured . 
The Red Cross report has leaked : torture and war crimes . 
Jane Mayer &apos;s impeccably researched expos√© The Dark Side just hit the stores : torture , crafted and directed from the top . 
The Washington Post gave readers actual video footage of the abusive interrogation of a Canadian minor , Omar Khadr , who was seen showing his still-bleeding abdominal wounds , weeping and pleading with his captors . 
So the truth is out and freely available . 
And America is still napping , worrying about its weight , and hanging out at the mall . 
I had thought that after so much exposure , thousands of Americans would be holding vigils on Capitol Hill , that religious leaders would be asking God &apos;s forgiveness , and that a popular groundswell of revulsion , similar to the nineteenth-century anti-slavery movement , would emerge . 
To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln , if torture is not wrong , nothing is wrong . 
And yet no such thing has occurred . 
There is no crisis in America &apos;s churches and synagogues , no Christian and Jewish leaders crying out for justice in the name of Jesus , a tortured political prisoner , or of Yahweh , who demands righteousness . 
I asked a contact in the interfaith world why . 
He replied , &quot; The mainstream churches don &apos;t care , because they are Republican . 
And the synagogues don &apos;t care , because the prisoners are Arabs . &quot; 
It was then that I realized that I could not be in love with my country right now . 
How can I care about the fate of people like that ? 
If this is what Americans are feeling , if that is who we are , we don &apos;t deserve our Constitution and Bill of Rights . 
Even America &apos;s vaunted judicial system has failed to constrain obvious abuses . 
A Federal court has ruled that the military tribunals system - Star Chambers where evidence derived from torture is used against the accused - can proceed . 
Another recently ruled that the president may call anyone anywhere an &quot; enemy combatant &quot; and detain him or her indefinitely . 
So Americans are colluding with a criminal regime . 
We have become an outlaw nation - a clear and present danger to international law and global stability - among civilized countries that have been our allies . 
We are - rightly - on Canada &apos;s list of rogue nations that torture . 
Europe is still high from Barack Obama &apos;s recent visit . 
Many Americans , too , hope that an Obama victory in November will roll back this nightmare . 
But this is no time to yield to delusions . 
Even if Obama wins , he may well be a radically weakened president . 
The Bush administration has created a transnational apparatus of lawlessness that he alone , without global intervention , can neither roll back nor control . 
Private security firms - for example , Blackwater - will still be operating , accountable neither to him nor to Congress , and not bound , they have argued , by international treaties . 
Weapons manufacturers and the telecommunications industry , with billions at stake in maintaining a hyped &quot; war on terror &quot; and their new global surveillance market , will deploy a lavishly financed army of lobbyists to defend their interests . 
Moreover , if elected , Obama will be constrained by his own Democratic Party . 
America &apos;s political parties bear little resemblance to the disciplined organizations familiar in parliamentary democracies in Europe and elsewhere . 
And Democrats in Congress will be even more divided after November if , as many expect , conservative members defeat Republican incumbents damaged by their association with Bush . 
To be sure , some Democrats have recently launched Congressional hearings into the Bush administration &apos;s abuses of power . 
Unfortunately , with virtually no media coverage , there is little pressure to broaden official investigations and ensure genuine accountability . 
But , while grassroots pressure has not worked , money still talks . 
We need targeted government-led sanctions against the US by civilized countries , including international divestment of capital . 
Many studies have shown that tying investment to democracy and human rights reform is effective in the developing world . 
There is no reason why it can &apos;t be effective against the world &apos;s superpower . 
We also need an internationally coordinated strategy for prosecuting war criminals at the top and further down the chain of command - individual countries pressing charges , as Italy and France have done . 
Although the United States is not a signatory to the statute that established the International Criminal Court , violations of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions are war crimes for which anyone - potentially even the US president - may be tried in any of the other 193 countries that are parties to the conventions . 
The whole world can hunt these criminals down . 
An outlaw America is a global problem that threatens the rest of the international community . 
If this regime gets away with flouting international law , what is to prevent the next administration - or this administration , continuing under its secret succession plan in the event of an emergency - from going further and targeting its political opponents at home and abroad ? 
We Americans are either too incapable , or too dysfunctional , to help ourselves right now . 
Like drug addicts or the mentally ill who refuse treatment , we need our friends to intervene . 
So remember us as we were in our better moments , and take action to save us - and the world - from ourselves . 
Maybe then I can fall in love with my country again .
