China &apos;s Monetary-Policy Surprise 
NEW HAVEN - In economic policy , as in most other areas , actions speak louder than words . 
By cutting its benchmark policy interest rates on November 21 , the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) has underscored the tactical focus of the government &apos;s stabilization policy , which aims to put a floor of around 7 % on GDP growth . 
Achieving this goal will be no small feat . 
China &apos;s economy is caught in the crossfire of structural and cyclical headwinds . 
The cyclical challenges , in particular , are proving to be more vexing than anticipated . 
Though exports have declined considerably from their pre-crisis peak of 35 % of GDP , they continue to account for about 24 % , leaving China exposed to the global growth cycle - especially to markets in the developed world , where demand is exceptionally weak . 
Indeed , 42 % of Chinese exports go to Europe , the United States , and Japan - three economies that are flirting with secular stagnation . 
Given that development strategies typically begin to fail when economies reach middle-income status - a threshold that China is rapidly approaching - China cannot afford to allow mounting cyclical risks to undermine its structural transformation . 
Modern history shows that the easiest way for a developing country to become ensnared in the dreaded &quot; middle-income trap &quot; is to cling to its old model for too long . 
The fact is that only structural transformation can lift a middle-income developing country to high-income developed status . 
Fortunately , China &apos;s leaders recognize this , and are committed to achieving it . 
President Xi Jinping has been spearheading the effort to press ahead with reform and rebalancing . 
A year ago , at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , Xi and his team created the country &apos;s most ambitious economic-reform agenda in 35 years . 
At the same time , China has been shifting responsibility for implementing reform from its antiquated planning apparatus ( the National Development and Reform Commission ) to a more effective market-based mechanism embedded in the CCP &apos;s structure ( the Leading Small Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms ) . 
Add to that Xi &apos;s unprecedented anti-corruption campaign , and there is no turning back on China &apos;s road to rebalancing and structural change . 
But the risk of cyclical disruptions , such as an unexpected decline in global economic growth , remains . 
How can it stay the reform course without being derailed by a significant growth slowdown in the short term ? 
This is not the first time that China has confronted this challenge - nor will it be the last . 
With global trade collapsing and Chinese export demand having plummeted from 26 % annual growth in mid-2008 to a 27 % contraction by early 2009 , the government moved aggressively to inject CN Â¥ 4 trillion ( $ 586 billion ) into the economy . 
Though this enabled growth to recover by the end of 2009 , it also contributed to new problems , including excessive debt , a property-market overhang , and mounting local-government financial risk . 
The last thing China needs is more fiscal stimulus . 
Today &apos;s cyclical disruption pales in comparison to that of 2008-2009 , and , unlike the fiscally reckless developed economies , China recognizes excessive government debt as a legitimate threat to sustainable growth and development . 
Moreover , unlike major developed economies , most of which have used up all of their conventional monetary-policy ammunition by reducing their policy interest rates to zero , China has plenty of monetary stimulus on reserve to address cyclical disruptions . 
In these circumstances , it makes sense for China to lean more on monetary policy than on fiscal expansion . 
Nonetheless , the PBOC &apos;s tactical decision is not without potential pitfalls - not least because interest-rate cuts encourage the extension of more credit at a time when China is trying to wean itself from debt-intensive growth . 
A key challenge will be to avoid escalating credit risk , which could undermine the process of reform and rebalancing . 
From the start , China &apos;s leaders knew that the interaction between structural transformation and the business cycle would be complex . 
As former Premier Wen Jiabao noted nearly eight years ago , China &apos;s economy had become increasingly &quot; unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and unsustainable . &quot; 
The longer China delayed addressing its problems , the more intractable the solution became . 
Xi and his colleagues are resolute in attempting to solve this problem by staying the course to rebalance the Chinese economy , while remaining acutely aware of cyclical risks . 
After all , China &apos;s vulnerability to such risks is rooted in its old growth model , which was allowed to remain in place for far too long . 
With the recent monetary easing , the Chinese authorities seem to be drawing a line in the sand to prevent an excessive drop in growth . This suggests that they now view a cyclical disruption as a real threat to the country &apos;s longer-term structural-reform agenda . 
To the extent that those fears persist , additional monetary easing can be expected .
