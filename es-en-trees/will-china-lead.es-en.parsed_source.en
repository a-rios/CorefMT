Will China Lead ? 
NEW YORK - China &apos;s willingness to join negotiations on potential sanctions against Iran and to send President Hu Jintao to a nuclear security summit in Washington this month are important preliminary steps towards taking more responsibility in managing international affairs . 
Given its growing profile , China must do far more to demonstrate its bona fides as a responsible global leader or risk undermining the system that has enabled its own miraculous rise . 
China has emerged as a world power far more quickly than most observers - and China &apos;s own leaders - might have predicted as little as a decade ago . 
China &apos;s rapid economic growth , juxtaposed against America &apos;s problems in Iraq and Afghanistan , monumental debt , and role in sparking the global financial crisis , have changed global power realities - and global perceptions of those realities even more . 
China &apos;s current international influence likely outstrips its desire or capacity . 
This puts China in a difficult position in relation to the so-called international system - the structures and rules created by the United States and others after the Second World War to check national sovereignty through a system of overlapping jurisdictions , transnational obligations , and fundamental rights . 
China has been an enormous beneficiary of this system , and its rise would have been unthinkable without the US-led free-trade system and globalization process , access to US markets , and global shipping lanes secured by the US Navy . 
But China &apos;s history of humiliation at the hands of European colonial powers has made its leaders ardent supporters of inviolable national rights and suspicious of any sacrifice of sovereignty . 
Because China &apos;s leaders are not popularly elected , their legitimacy stems largely from two sources - their connection to the Chinese revolution and their ability to deliver national security and economic growth . 
Although Mao Zedong is widely implicated in the unnecessary death of millions and is officially designated by the current regime as having been 30 % wrong , his photograph still adorns Tiananmen Square , because the regime &apos;s legitimacy depends in part on its connection to the restoration of national sovereignty that Mao represents . 
The economic foundation of the Chinese government &apos;s legitimacy also places an enormous burden on China &apos;s leaders to make decisions that foster domestic economic growth at the expense of virtually everything else - including , some say , the viability of the international currency regime , nuclear non-proliferation , and basic rights in resource-rich countries . 
This dichotomy creates a difficult situation as China emerges as the world &apos;s second largest economy . 
If China , in the name of national sovereignty , does not buy into the international system , it becomes hard to argue that this system exists . 
China &apos;s unwillingness , for example , to join other members of the international community in pressuring Iran and North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons programs foreshadows the potential collapse of the nuclear non-proliferation regime . 
China &apos;s active courtship of countries that violate human rights on a massive scale , such as Sudan , North Korea , and Burma , similarly represents a preliminary decapitation of the international human rights regime . 
Given its size and importance , and regardless of its intentions , China will , perhaps inadvertently , destroy the international system if it does not either actively endorse and work to maintain it , or reframe it for the greater common good . 
If it does neither , the world is in trouble . 
If China sees itself as the heir and beneficiary of the US-led post-war international system , it must do much more to prevent and roll back nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea , pay a much greater percentage of costs for the United Nations , and curtail its mercantilist policies . 
It must also end its alleged corrupt practices in resource-rich parts of the developing world , align its currency policy with global norms , lead efforts to curb greenhouse-gas emissions , and , more generally , take into more account the fate of people outside of China in its decision-making . 
If , on the other hand , as is its right , Chinese leaders have an alternative vision of what an improved international system might look like , the onus is on them to articulate that vision and outline what they are willing to do to realize it . 
There may be a better international model than the current one , but it will not emerge by default . 
As US Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman demonstrated in the 1940 &quot; s , such a system must be articulated and then forged through decisive action and global leadership . 
If China sees inviolable state sovereignty as the foundation of twenty-first century international affairs , as now appears to be the case , then it must explain why this principle will not lead to the same disastrous consequences as it did in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . 
The US and the international community must acknowledge that today &apos;s fast-rising China has earned the right to play an important role in shaping how the twenty-first century unfolds . 
Those countries that value the current system will increasingly feel the urge to close ranks to defend it .
