Ethics in Gaza 
MELBOURNE - Is Israel &apos;s military action in Gaza morally defensible ? 
Different answers to that question are possible . 
Some depend on answers to prior questions about the founding of the state of Israel , the circumstances that led to many Palestinians becoming refugees , and responsibility for the failure of earlier efforts to reach a peaceful solution . 
But let us put aside these questions - which have been explored in great depth - and focus on the moral issues raised by the latest outbreak of hostilities . 
The immediate trigger for the current conflict was the murder of three Jewish teenagers in Hebron , on the West Bank . 
Israel , blaming Hamas , arrested hundreds of its members in the West Bank , though it has never explained the basis of its accusation . 
The Israeli government may have seized on the outrageous murders as a pretext for provoking Hamas into a response that would allow Israel , in turn , to invade and destroy the tunnels Hamas has dug from Gaza into Israel . 
Though Israeli leaders claim to have been surprised by the extent and sophistication of the tunnels they discovered , Israel &apos;s military briefed the government on the tunnels more than a year ago , and the government created a special task force to consider how to deal with them . 
Hamas responded to the West Bank arrests with a barrage of rockets that reached Tel Aviv and Jerusalem , though without causing any injuries . 
Israel then began its air attacks , followed by a ground invasion . 
At the time of writing , more than 1,600 Palestinians have been killed , most of them civilians , by Israeli air and ground strikes . 
Three Israeli civilians have been killed by rocket or mortar fire from Gaza , and 64 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the ground invasion began . 
In firing rockets at Israel , Hamas invited a military response . 
A country subject to rocket attacks from across its border has a right to defend itself , even if its own actions can be construed as having provoked the attacks , and the attacks themselves are relatively ineffective . 
But a right of self-defense does not mean a right to do anything that can be construed as a defensive act , regardless of the cost to civilians . 
Despite calls in some Israeli media for Gaza to be bombed &quot; back to the stone age , &quot; the Israeli government seems to accept that that would be wrong . 
Israel has taken some steps to minimize civilian casualties by warning Palestinians to evacuate areas that were about to be targeted . 
Hamas , by contrast , has shown no interest in avoiding civilian casualties , either in Israel or in Gaza . 
The whole point of firing rockets at Israeli cities is to inflict civilian casualties , and the fact that the rockets have largely failed to do so is due to their inaccuracy , Israel &apos;s &quot; Iron Dome &quot; missile-defense system , and perhaps some good luck . 
Hamas &apos;s strategy of launching rockets from residential areas and storing them in schools clearly reflects its leaders &quot; willingness to put Palestinian civilians in harm &apos;s way in order to confront Israel with the grim choice of killing civilians or allowing the rocket attacks to continue . 
So , whatever moral objections to Israel &apos;s actions over the past month there might be , there are even more serious objections to be made against Hamas . 
In contrast to previous episodes , Arab countries like Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia have been very restrained in their criticism of Israel , though perhaps less for moral reasons and more because they regard militant Islam as a graver threat than Israel to their own regimes . 
But to say that Israel &apos;s actions are less clearly wrong than those of Hamas is not to say much . 
Israel has legitimate military objectives in Gaza : to stop the rockets and destroy the tunnels . 
It should be pursuing those objectives while showing the utmost concern for Gaza &apos;s trapped civilians . 
In a recent article , Fania Oz-Salzberger , writing from Tel Aviv while rockets were being intercepted overhead , urged her government to send medical supplies to the villages of Gaza . 
Since then , the Israeli military has set up a field hospital on the border with Gaza to treat wounded Palestinians . 
That is a positive step , but it is outweighed by repeated instances of Israeli airstrikes and shelling that appear to have needlessly killed civilians , from the four boys killed on a beach on July 16 to the 20 Palestinian civilians killed while taking refuge in a United Nations school on July 30 . 
These incidents are reminiscent of past NATO operations in Afghanistan , in which there was manifestly less care taken to safeguard the lives of local civilians than there would have been if the lives of NATO troops , or their civilian compatriots , had been at risk . 
Some will shrug and say , &quot; War is hell . &quot; 
But between the untenable extremes of pacifism and the elevation of war to something beyond morality , there is a middle ground that seeks to minimize the unquestionable evil of war . 
We can acknowledge that Israel has made some efforts to do that , but we must still say : It is not enough .
