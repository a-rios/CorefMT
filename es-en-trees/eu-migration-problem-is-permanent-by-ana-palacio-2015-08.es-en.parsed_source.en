Migration Beyond Crisis Mode 
MADRID - Over the past seven years , Europe has been in crisis mode almost without interruption . 
From Ukraine to Greece , events have led the continent from the frying pan to the fire and back again , with all of the attendant summitry , declarations , and brinkmanship . 
Now , it is a migration crisis - one that is unlikely to be resolved in the foreseeable future - that is commanding the European Union &apos;s attention . 
But , if Europe is to respond effectively , it must move beyond crisis mode to understand both what it is facing and what it wants to achieve . 
It is indisputable that migration deserves the EU &apos;s focus . 
Not only are migrant flows into Europe shattering records from one month to the next ; migrants &quot; primary entry points are changing as well . Meanwhile , the already-hazy lines between asylum-seekers , refugees , displaced persons , and purely economic migrants are becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish at all . 
The dangerous conditions of the migrants &quot; journey constitute a serious humanitarian crisis . 
Since the beginning of this year , roughly 2,500 people have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean , to say nothing of gruesome scenes like the recent discovery of 71 decomposing bodies in an abandoned truck in Austria . 
Thousands more languish in makeshift camps with little or no support . 
To make matters worse , there has been a steady stream of migration-related violence across Europe , from an arson attack on a planned refugee shelter in Germany to police brutality against migrants in Macedonia and Hungary . 
The port of Calais has become a chokepoint of the crisis , with migrants desperately trying to force their way onto trucks and trains bound for the United Kingdom . 
The situation screams &quot; emergency &quot; - and has triggered a response by the EU . Most notably , the EU has tripled the budget of Operation Triton , designed to strengthen border security ; launched an EU-wide naval operation against human smugglers and traffickers in the Mediterranean ( EUNAVFOR Med ) ; and allocated additional funds to overwhelmed frontline member countries . Most notably , Germany , despite facing the arrival of a predicted 800,000 asylum-seekers this year , has suspended implementation of the EU &apos;s Dublin Regulation , which would have led to the deportation of thousands of Syrian refugees . 
But these measures , though helpful , are far from adequate . In fact , they are examples of crisis-mode policymaking , which tends to favor impressive-seeming stopgap measures ( not to mention lofty declarations that can verge on hollowness or hyperbole ) , instead of real solutions . By allowing EU leaders to avoid acknowledging the long-term nature of the migrant challenge , this approach weakens their motivation to take collective action . And , indeed , a reluctance to cooperate was on display at last month &apos;s meeting of the EU &apos;s Justice and Home Affairs Council , where representatives failed to produce an arrangement on how to distribute the paltry 40,000 refugees that the European Council agreed to accept in June . 
The fact is that the pressure of migration is here to stay . 
After all , the factors driving hundreds of thousands of people to risk everything to get to Europe are nowhere near being resolved . 
Iraq and Syria remain mired in violence and chaos ; 
Add to that weak or non-existent governance in much of Africa ( and the concomitant security threats and bleak economic prospects ) , and it is difficult to imagine how the tide of migrants will be slowed . 
The chance of a better life - or any life at all - is all but irresistible to the people trapped in these areas . 
No matter how strong the EU &apos;s external borders are - though , of course , better monitoring and patrolling measures are needed - the flow of migrants will continue to overwhelm their capacity , endangering the openness that is so fundamental to European unification , beginning with the Schengen acquis , which guarantees freedom of movement , without border controls , among 26 European countries . 
If Europe is to adapt to the migrant challenge , and design realistic and productive solutions that heed European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker &apos;s call for &quot; collective courage , &quot; it must target the root causes and enablers of the current migration wave . 
Specifically , the EU must support governance reform , economic development , and the establishment of basic human security in the countries that migrants are fleeing . 
At the same time , efforts are needed to strengthen deterrence near and en route to Europe &apos;s borders , through partnerships with major source and transit countries . 
Legal channels of migration should be opened for those who either deserve protection under international law or possess skills that could benefit European societies . 
For migrants who reach EU territory , are not entitled to international legal protection , and lack such vital skills , repatriation regimes must be established . 
All of this will require an update of the legal categorizations of migrants , as well as burden-sharing within the EU , which is glaringly absent at the moment . 
The EU cannot simply wait out the current migration crisis by implementing piecemeal and panicked measures in the hope that the problem will eventually resolve itself . 
What is needed is careful consideration of how best to balance humanitarian imperatives with security concerns , domestic social welfare with international legal obligations , and member countries &quot; duties to one another with their responsibilities to their own citizens . 
Only then can leaders design the kind of thoughtful , comprehensive , and forward-looking strategy that the migrant crisis - and , indeed , the EU &apos;s own survival - demands .
