The Economic Consequences of the Arab Revolt 
NEW YORK - Political turmoil in the Middle East has powerful economic and financial implications , particularly as it increases the risk of stagflation , a lethal combination of slowing growth and sharply rising inflation . 
Indeed , should stagflation emerge , there is a serious risk of a double-dip recession for a global economy that has barely emerged from its worst crisis in decades . 
Severe unrest in the Middle East has historically been a source of oil-price spikes , which in turn have triggered three of the last five global recessions . 
The Yom Kippur War in 1973 caused a sharp increase in oil prices , leading to the global stagflation of 1974-1975 . 
The Iranian revolution in 1979 led to a similar stagflationary increase in oil prices , which culminated in the recession of 1980-1981 . 
And Iraq &apos;s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 led to a spike in oil prices at a time when a US banking crisis was already tipping America into recession . 
Oil prices also played a role in the recent finance-driven global recession . 
By the summer of 2008 , just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers , oil prices had doubled over the previous 12 months , reaching a peak of $ 148 a barrel - and delivering the coup de gr√¢ce to an already frail and struggling global economy buffeted by financial shocks . 
We don &apos;t know yet whether political contagion in the Middle East will spread to other countries . 
The turmoil may yet be contained and recede , sending oil prices back to lower levels . 
But there is a serious chance that the uprisings will spread , destabilizing Bahrain , Algeria , Oman , Jordan , Yemen , and eventually even Saudi Arabia . 
Even before the recent Middle East political shocks , oil prices had risen above $ 80- $ 90 a barrel , an increase driven not only by energy-thirsty emerging-market economies , but also by non-fundamental factors : a wall of liquidity chasing assets and commodities in emerging markets , owing to near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing in advanced economies ; momentum and herding behavior ; and limited and inelastic oil supplies . 
If the threat of supply disruptions spreads beyond Libya , even the mere risk of lower output may sharply increase the &quot; fear premium &quot; via precautionary stockpiling of oil by investors and final users . 
The latest increases in oil prices - and the related increases in other commodity prices , especially food - imply several unfortunate consequences ( even leaving aside the risk of severe civil unrest ) . 
First , inflationary pressure will grow in already-overheating emerging market economies , where oil and food prices represent up to two-thirds of the consumption basket . 
Given weak demand in slow-growing advanced economies , rising commodity prices may lead only to a small first-round effect on headline inflation there , with little second-round impact on core inflation . 
But advanced countries will not emerge unscathed . 
Indeed , the second risk posed by higher oil prices - a terms-of-trade and disposable income shock to all energy and commodity importers - will hit advanced economies especially hard , as they have barely emerged from recession and are still experiencing an anemic recovery . 
The third risk is that rising oil prices reduce investor confidence and increase risk aversion , leading to stock-market corrections that have negative wealth effects on consumption and capital spending . 
Business and consumer confidence are also likely to take a hit , further undermining demand . 
If oil prices rise much further - towards the peaks of 2008 - the advanced economies will slow sharply ; many might even slip back into recession . 
And , even if prices remain at current levels for most of the year , global growth will slow and inflation will rise . 
What policy responses are available to dampen the risk of stagflation ? 
In the short run , there are very few : Saudi Arabia - the only OPEC producer with excess capacity - could increase its output , and the US could use its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase the supply of oil . 
Over time - but this could take years - consumers could invest in alternative energy sources and reduce demand for fossil fuels via carbon taxes and new technologies . 
Because energy and food security are matters of economic as well as social and political stability , policies that reduce commodity-price volatility should be in the interest of producers and consumers . 
But the time to act is now . 
The transition from autocracy to democracy in the Middle East is likely to be bumpy and unstable , at best . 
In countries with pent-up demand for higher income and welfare , democratic fervor could lead to large budget deficits , excessive wage demands , and high inflation , ultimately resulting in severe economic crises . 
So a bold new assistance program should be designed for the region , modeled on the Marshall Plan in Western Europe after WWII , or on the support offered to Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Berlin Wall . 
Financing should come from the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , as well as from bilateral support provided by the US , the European Union , China , and the Gulf states . 
The goal should be to stabilize these countries &quot; economies as they undertake their delicate political transitions . 
The stakes are high . 
Unstable political transitions could lead to high levels of social disorder , organized violence , and / or civil war , fueling further economic and political turmoil . 
Given the current risk-sensitivity of oil prices , the pain would not be confined to the Middle East .
