What International Community ? 
NEW YORK - Whenever something bad happens - Iran moving closer to acquiring nuclear weapons , North Korea firing another missile , civilian deaths reaching another grim milestone in Syria &apos;s civil war , satellites revealing an alarming rate of polar-ice melt - some official or observer will call upon the international community to act . 
There is only one problem : there is no &quot; international community . &quot; 
Part of the reason stems from the absence of any mechanism for &quot; the world &quot; to come together . 
The United Nations General Assembly comes closest , but little can be expected from an organization that equates the United States or China with , say , Fiji or Guinea-Bissau . 
To be fair , those who founded the UN after World War II created the Security Council as the venue in which major powers would meet to determine the world &apos;s fate . 
But even that has not worked out as planned , partly because the world of 2013 bears little resemblance to that of 1945 . 
How else could one explain that Britain and France , but not Germany , Japan , or India , are permanent , veto-wielding members ? 
Alas , there is no agreement on how to update the Security Council . 
Efforts like the G-20 are welcome , but they lack authority and capacity , in addition to suffering from excessive size . 
The result is &quot; multilateralism &apos;s dilemma &quot; : the inclusion of more actors increases an organization &apos;s legitimacy at the expense of its utility . 
No amount of UN reform could make things fundamentally different . 
Today &apos;s major powers do not agree on the rules that ought to govern the world , much less on the penalties for breaking them . 
Even where there is accord in principle , there is little agreement in practice . 
The result is a world that is messier and more dangerous than it should be . 
Consider climate change . 
Burning fossil fuels is having a measurable impact on the earth &apos;s temperature . 
But reducing carbon emissions has proved impossible , because such a commitment could constrain GDP growth ( anathema to developed countries mired in economic malaise ) and impede access to energy and electricity for billions of people in developing countries , which is unacceptable to China and India . 
Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons would seem a more promising issue for global collaboration . 
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) limits the right to possess nuclear weapons to the Security Council &apos;s five permanent members , and then only temporarily . 
But agreement is thinner than it appears . 
The NPT allows countries the right to develop nuclear energy for purposes such as electricity generation , a loophole that allows governments to build most of what is necessary to produce the fuel for a nuclear weapon . 
The inspection regime created in 1957 under the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) is a gentlemen &apos;s agreement ; inspectors can inspect only those facilities that are made known to them by the government in question . 
Governments ( such as Iran &apos;s ) can and do carry out illegal nuclear activities in secret sites that international inspectors either do not know about or cannot enter . 
At least as important , there is no agreement on what to do when a country violates the NPT , as Iran and North Korea ( which withdrew from the treaty in 2003 ) have done . 
More international cooperation exists in the economic realm . 
There has been real progress toward reducing tariff barriers ; the World Trade Organization has also established a dispute-resolution mechanism for its 159 members . 
But progress on expanding free trade at the global level has stalled , as many countries disagree on the treatment of agricultural goods , the elimination of subsidies , and trade in services . 
Meanwhile , cooperation in the realm of cyberspace is just getting started - with difficulty . 
The US is most concerned about cyber security and the protection of intellectual property and infrastructure . 
Authoritarian governments are more concerned about information security - the ability to control what is available on the Internet in order to maintain political and social stability . 
There is no agreement on what , if anything , constitutes an appropriate target for espionage . 
The prevalence of non-state actors is further complicating efforts . 
Another area where there is less international community than meets the eye is human suffering . 
Governments that attack their own people on a large scale , or allow such attacks to be carried out , expose themselves to the threat of outside intervention . 
This &quot; Responsibility to Protect , &quot; or R2P , was enshrined by the UN in 2005 . 
But many governments are concerned that R2P raises expectations that they will act , which could prove costly in terms of lives , military expenditure , and commercial priorities . 
Some governments are also worried that R2P could be turned on them . 
Russian and Chinese reticence about pressuring governments that deserve censure and sanction stems partly from such concerns ; the absence of consensus on Syria is just one result . 
In short , those looking to the international community to deal with the world &apos;s problems will be disappointed . 
This is not reason for despair or grounds for acting unilaterally . 
But so long as &quot; international community &quot; is more hope than reality , multilateralism will have to become more varied . 
In the trade area , this implies regional and bilateral accords . 
On climate change , it makes sense to seek &quot; mini-agreements &quot; that set minimum common standards for fuel efficiency , slow deforestation , or limit the largest economies &quot; carbon output . 
In these and other areas , governments will need to rally around regional undertakings , form coalitions of the relevant or willing , or simply seek understandings among countries to do their best to adopt common policies . 
Such approaches may lack the reach and legitimacy of formal global undertakings , but they do have the advantage of getting something done .
