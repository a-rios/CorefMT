A Year of Reckoning for France and Europe 
PARIS - France is at a crossroads . 
It has numerous valuable assets , but it cannot postpone long-overdue reforms , or else it will become increasingly irrelevant in a fiercely competitive global economy . 
This is the economic challenge that President François Hollande , Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault , and all of us in the French government must confront . 
We face a historic responsibility : we need to modernize the French economy , and introduce in a few months a decade &apos;s worth of reforms to generate stronger , more inclusive growth , create more jobs , and shrink public deficits . 
This is precisely what the government has been doing since the election earlier this year ; indeed , no French government has ever carried out so many reforms in such a short period of time . 
France &apos;s economic performance has been lackluster during the past ten years , particularly with respect to competitiveness , debt sustainability , public spending , and the labor market . 
Our responsibility is to ensure that we are doing better in each of these areas by 2017 , when the current electoral term expires . 
To meet this challenge , we have designed an economic strategy that rests on three pillars : Europe , fiscal consolidation , and competitiveness . 
Europe is our number one priority : stabilizing the eurozone and resolving its current crisis are essential to stability and economic recovery in France . 
Hollande &apos;s government insists that we will be successful only if three conditions are met . 
First , Europe should adopt a balanced approach to fiscal consolidation - a necessary process , but self-defeating when carried out too quickly . 
We must then break the perverse feedback loop between banking risk and sovereign risk that is at the heart of the euro crisis . 
This requires implementing a fully-fledged banking union - with a pan-European supervisor and a strong regime for banking resolution and deposit insurance - as soon as possible . 
Finally , in the medium to long term , we must complete the eurozone integration process and move forward on solidarity and risk-sharing - for example , by establishing a eurozone-specific budget . 
In late November , the eurozone finally agreed on a partial rescheduling of Greece &apos;s debt to alleviate the country &apos;s financial burden . 
It was a critical step toward stabilization , but more must be done . 
In 2013 , we will have to turn our gaze to other countries ( such as Cyprus and Spain ) , and ensure that we maintain the momentum needed to build a banking union . 
Fiscal consolidation is the second pillar of France &apos;s economic strategy . 
France has not adopted a balanced budget in the last 30 years , and its public debt reached an unsustainable € 1.7 trillion ( $ 2.2 trillion ) in 2011 . 
Our duty is to rise to the occasion and reverse the tide . 
France is fully committed to a fiscal-consolidation effort that returns it to a balanced budget by 2017 . 
This is not just a political commitment ; we have enshrined France &apos;s fiscal path in a law adopted in November . 
The coming year will be a milestone on this path : France is targeting a 3 % -of-GDP budget deficit in 2013 , down from 5.2 % in 2011 and 4.5 % in 2012 , and a lower debt / GDP ratio from 2014 onward . 
This is an ambitious commitment , and one that we intend to meet without resorting to an old-fashioned &quot; tax and spend &quot; fiscal policy : over the next five years , spending cuts will be larger than tax increases , reaching € 60 billion over five years . 
Obviously we will have to modernize France &apos;s administration to achieve this , looking to other countries for best practices . 
Finally , we have committed ourselves to measures aimed at addressing France &apos;s weakened competitiveness , via a &quot; National Pact for Growth , Competitiveness , and Employment , &quot; which includes a € 20 billion cut in labor costs for employers , to be phased in over three years . 
A new corporate-tax credit will cut payroll taxes by 6 % for all wages below 2.5 times the minimum wage - a step that will benefit more than 80 % of all salaried workers . 
And , because expectations for France &apos;s competitiveness agenda are high , we will ensure swift implementation of the National Pact so that it can start producing results as soon as 2013 . 
We have designed the corporate-tax credit to maximize its positive impact on the economy : labor costs will fall immediately without depressing aggregate demand in 2013 , because the spending cuts ( € 10 billion ) and household tax increases that will fund the credit will begin only in 2014 . 
The Pact also improves the business environment and creates mechanisms , such as the extension of a research tax rebate , designed to boost innovation . 
Last but not least , we have launched a major labor-market reform that will establish our own version of northern Europe &apos;s &quot; flexicurity &quot; model . 
Firms need more flexibility to adjust their payrolls in adverse economic conditions ; and workers need more security , provided by better training and active labor-market policies . 
But we are committed to doing so while remaining true to our political convictions , and without jeopardizing what makes France both strong and special : a highly redistributive social model . 
Europe is and will be part of the solution , if we can agree that more solidarity is the next step in our shared journey . 
Europe needs more solidarity not only to overcome the crisis and complete the eurozone integration process , but also to bridge the widening divide between Europe and its peoples . 
I look forward to 2013 as a year of progress on our national and European agendas alike . 
They are , after all , two sides of the same coin .
