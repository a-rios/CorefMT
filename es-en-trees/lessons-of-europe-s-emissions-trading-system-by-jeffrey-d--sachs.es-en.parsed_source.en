A Better Way to Fight Climate Change 
NEW YORK - Of all major world regions , Europe has worked the hardest to implement policies aimed at countering human-caused climate change . 
Yet the cornerstone of Europe &apos;s approach - a continent-wide emissions trading system for the greenhouse gases that cause climate change - is in trouble . 
That experience suggests a better strategy for both Europe and the rest of the world . 
The basic story of human-caused climate change is becoming clearer to the global public . 
Several gases , including carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide , warm the planet as their concentrations in the atmosphere increase . 
As the world economy grows , so do emissions of these gases , accelerating the pace of human-caused climate change . 
The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide . 
Most CO2 emissions result from the burning of fossil fuels - coal , oil , and natural gas - for energy , global consumption of which is rising as the world economy grows . 
As a result , we are on a path to very dangerous levels of CO2 in the atmosphere . 
Twenty years ago , the world agreed to reduce sharply emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases , but little progress has been made . 
Instead , the rapid growth of the emerging economies , especially coal-burning China , has caused global CO2 emissions to soar . 
Dangerous changes in climate have already begun . 
If the world continues on its current trajectory , global temperatures will eventually rise by several degrees centigrade , causing higher sea levels , mega-storms , severe heat waves , massive crop failures , extreme droughts , heavy flooding , and a sharp loss of biodiversity . 
Yet changing the world &apos;s energy system is a daunting challenge , because fossil fuels are so deeply embedded in the workings of the global economy . 
Oil provides the main fuel for transportation worldwide . 
Coal and gas are burned in huge and growing amounts to produce electricity and to provide energy for industry . 
How , then , can we sustain worldwide economic progress while cutting back sharply on carbon emissions ? 
There are essentially two solutions , but neither has been deployed on a large scale . 
The first is to shift massively from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources , especially wind power and solar power . 
Some countries will also continue to use nuclear power . 
( Hydroelectric power generation emits no CO2 , but there are only a few remaining places in the world where it can be expanded without major environmental or social costs . ) 
The second solution is to capture CO2 emissions for storage underground . 
One approach is to capture the CO2 at the power plant as the coal or gas is burned . 
Another is to capture it directly from the air using specially designed chemical processes . 
Either way , CCS will require significant investment in further research and development before it becomes a viable technology . 
The big problem is time . 
If we had a century to change the world &apos;s energy system , we could feel reasonably secure . 
Yet we must complete most of the transformation to low-carbon energy by mid-century . 
Few economic regions have made much progress in this transformation . 
In fact , the United States is now investing heavily in natural gas without recognizing or caring that its shale-gas boom , based on new hydraulic-fracturing technology , is likely to make matters worse . 
Even if the US economy shifts from coal to natural gas , America &apos;s coal will probably be exported for use elsewhere in the world . 
In any event , natural gas , though somewhat less carbon-intensive than coal , is a fossil fuel ; burning it will cause unacceptable climate damage . 
Only Europe has tried to make a serious shift away from carbon emissions , creating a system that requires each industrial emitter to obtain a permit for each ton of CO2 emissions . 
Because these permits trade at a market price , companies have an incentive to reduce their emissions , thereby requiring them to buy fewer permits or enabling them to sell excess permits for a profit . 
The problem is that the permits &quot; market price has plummeted in the midst of Europe &apos;s economic slowdown . 
Permits that used to sell for more than $ 30 per ton before the crisis now trade for under $ 10 . 
At this low price , companies have little incentive to cut back on their CO2 emissions - and little faith that a market-based incentive will return . 
As a result , much of European industry continues on a business-as-usual energy path , even as Europe tries to lead the world in this transformation . 
But there is a much better strategy than tradable permits . 
Each region of the world should introduce a tax on CO2 emissions that starts low today and increases gradually and predictably in the future . 
Part of the tax revenue should be channeled into subsidies for new low-carbon energy sources like wind and solar , and to cover the costs of developing CCS . 
These subsidies could start fairly high and decline gradually over time , as the tax on CO2 emissions rises and the costs of new energy technologies fall with more experience and innovation . 
With a long-term and predictable carbon tax and subsidy system , the world would move systematically toward low-carbon energy , greater energy efficiency , and CCS . 
Time is short .
