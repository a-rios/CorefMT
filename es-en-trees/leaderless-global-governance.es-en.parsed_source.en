Leaderless Global Governance 
CAMBRIDGE - The world economy is entering a new phase , in which achieving global cooperation will become increasingly difficult . 
The United States and the European Union , now burdened by high debt and low growth - and therefore preoccupied with domestic concerns - are no longer able to set global rules and expect others to fall into line . 
Compounding this trend , rising powers such as China and India place great value on national sovereignty and non-interference in domestic affairs . 
This makes them unwilling to submit to international rules ( or to demand that others comply with such rules ) - and thus unlikely to invest in multilateral institutions , as the US did in the aftermath of World War II . 
As a result , global leadership and cooperation will remain in limited supply , requiring a carefully calibrated response in the world economy &apos;s governance - specifically , a thinner set of rules that recognizes the diversity of national circumstances and demands for policy autonomy . 
But discussions in the G-20 , World Trade Organization , and other multilateral fora proceed as if the right remedy were more of the same - more rules , more harmonization , and more discipline on national policies . 
Going back to basics , the principle of &quot; subsidiarity &quot; provides the right way to think about global governance issues . 
It tells us which kinds of policies should be coordinated or harmonized globally , and which should be left largely to domestic decision-making processes . 
The principle demarcates areas where we need extensive global governance from those where only a thin layer of global rules suffices . 
Economic policies come in roughly four variants . 
At one extreme are domestic policies that create no ( or very few ) spillovers across national borders . 
Education policies , for example , require no international agreement and can be safely left to domestic policymakers . 
At the other extreme are policies that implicate the &quot; global commons &quot; : the outcome for each country is determined not by domestic policies , but by ( the sum total of ) other countries &quot; policies . 
Greenhouse-gas emissions are the archetypal case . 
In such policy domains , there is a strong case for establishing binding global rules , since each country , left to its own devices , has an interest in neglecting its share of the upkeep of the global commons . 
Failure to reach global agreement would condemn all to collective disaster . 
Between the extremes are two other types of policies that create spillovers , but that need to be treated differently . 
First , there are &quot; beggar-thy-neighbor &quot; policies , whereby a country derives an economic benefit at the expense of other countries . 
For example , its leaders restrict the supply of a natural resource in order to drive up its price on world markets , or pursue mercantilist policies in the form of large trade surpluses , especially in the presence of unemployment and excess capacity . 
Because beggar-thy-neighbor policies create benefits by imposing costs on others , they , too , need to be regulated at the international level . 
This is the strongest argument for subjecting China &apos;s currency policies or large macroeconomic imbalances like Germany &apos;s trade surplus to greater global discipline than currently exists . 
Beggar-thy-neighbor policies must be distinguished from what could be called &quot; beggar thyself &quot; policies , whose economic costs are borne primarily at home , though they might affect others as well . 
Consider agricultural subsidies , bans on genetically modified organisms , or lax financial regulation . 
While these policies might impose costs on other countries , they are deployed not to extract advantages from them , but because other domestic-policy motives - such as distributional , administrative , or public-health concerns - prevail over the objective of economic efficiency . 
The case for global discipline is quite a bit weaker with beggar-thyself policies . 
After all , it should not be up to the &quot; global community &quot; to tell individual countries how they ought to weight competing goals . 
Imposing costs on other countries is not , by itself , a cause for global regulation . 
( Indeed , economists hardly complain when a country &apos;s trade liberalization harms competitors . ) 
Democracies , in particular , ought to be allowed to make their own &quot; mistakes . &quot; 
Of course , there is no guarantee that domestic policies accurately reflect societal demands ; even democracies are frequently taken hostage by special interests . 
So the case for global rulemaking takes a rather different form with beggar-thyself policies , and calls for procedural requirements designed to enhance the quality of domestic policymaking . 
Global standards pertaining to transparency , broad representation , accountability , and use of empirical evidence , for example , do not constrain the end result . 
Different types of policies call for different responses at the global level . 
Too much global political capital nowadays is wasted on harmonizing beggar-thyself policies ( particularly in the areas of trade and financial regulation ) , and not enough is spent on beggar-thy-neighbor policies ( such as macroeconomic imbalances ) . 
Over-ambitious and misdirected efforts at global governance will not serve us well at a time when the supply of global leadership and cooperation is bound to remain limited .
