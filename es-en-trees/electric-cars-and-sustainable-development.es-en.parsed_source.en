Electric Cars and Sustainable Development 
NEW YORK - The key to climate change control lies in improved technology . 
We need to find new ways to produce and use energy , meet our food needs , transport ourselves , and heat and cool our homes that will allow us to cut back on oil , gas , coal , nitrogen-based fertilizer , and other sources of the climate-changing greenhouse gases . 
There are enough good options available to suggest that the world can accomplish the goal of controlling climate change at a reasonable cost ( perhaps 1 % of global income per year ) while enabling the world economy to continue to grow and raise living standards . 
One of the most exciting developments on the horizon is the new generation of electric automobiles . 
In the earliest days of the automobile in the late nineteenth century , many kinds of cars competed with each other - steam , battery , and internal combustion engine ( ICE ) . 
The gasoline and diesel-powered internal combustion engines won the competition with the success of the Model T , which first rolled off of the assembly line in 1908 . 
One hundred years later , competition is again stirring . 
The age of electric vehicles is upon us . 
The Toyota Prius , a hybrid-electric vehicle first introduced in Japan in 1997 , marked an initial breakthrough . 
By connecting a small generator and rechargeable battery to the braking system of a standard car , the hybrid augments the normal engine with a battery-powered motor . 
Gasoline mileage is sufficiently enhanced to make the hybrid commercially viable , and gasoline-saving vehicles will become even more commercially viable when consumers are taxed for the carbon dioxide they emit from their vehicles . 
Much more innovation is on the way , led by General Motors &quot; plug-in hybrid vehicle , the Chevy Volt , at the end of 2010 . 
While the Prius is a normal ICE automobile with a small motor , the Volt will be an electric vehicle with an engine alongside . 
The Volt &apos;s battery will be a cutting-edge , high-performance lithium-ion battery , which promises a range of 40 miles per charge and a six-hour recharge time drawing from a normal wall socket . 
Based on typical driving patterns , the Volt will get so many miles on the battery that it will achieve around 230 miles per gallon of gasoline ! 
Larry Burns , the visionary head of GM &apos;s research and development until his recent retirement , sees the electric vehicle as much more than an opportunity to save gasoline , important as that is . 
According to Burns , the electric-vehicle age will reshape the energy grid , redefine driving patterns , and generally improve the quality of life in urban areas , where most of the world &apos;s population will live and drive . 
First , there will be many types of electric vehicles , including the plug-in hybrid , the all-battery vehicle , and vehicles powered by the hydrogen fuel cell , essentially a battery fed by an external source of hydrogen . 
These different vehicles will be able to tap into countless energy sources . 
Solar , wind , or nuclear power - all free of CO2 emissions - can feed the power grid that will recharge the batteries . 
Similarly , these renewable energy sources can be used to split water into hydrogen and hydroxyl ion , and then use the hydrogen to power the hydrogen fuel cell . 
Second , the storage capacity of the vehicle fleet will play an important role in stabilizing the power grid . 
Not only will battery-powered vehicles draw power from the electricity grid during recharging , but , when parked , they can also feed additional power back into the grid during periods of peak demand . 
The automobile fleet will become part of the overall power grid , and will be managed efficiently ( and remotely ) to optimize the timing of recharging from , and returning power to , the grid . 
Third , electric-powered vehicles will open up a new world of &quot; smart &quot; vehicles , in which sensor systems and vehicle-to-vehicle communications will enable collision protection , traffic routing , and remote management of the vehicle . 
The integration of information technology and the vehicle &apos;s propulsion system will thereby introduce new standards of safety , convenience , and maintenance . 
These are visionary ideas , yet they are within technological reach . 
Automakers , utility companies , broadband providers , and government road builders will each have to contribute to an integrated system . 
All of these sectors will require new ways of competing and cooperating with the others . 
The public sector will have to put forward funding to enable the new generation of vehicles to reach commercialization - through R D outlays , consumer subsidies , and support for complementary infrastructure ( for example , outlets for recharging in public places ) . 
The new age of the electric vehicle exemplifies the powerful opportunities that we can grasp as we make our way from the unsustainable fossil-fuel age to a new age of sustainable technologies . 
Our climate negotiators today bicker with each other because they view the climate challenge only in negative terms : who will pay to reduce fossil-fuel use ? 
Yet Burns &quot; vision for the automobile reminds us that the transition to sustainability can bring real breakthroughs in the quality of life . 
We need to rethink the climate challenge as an opportunity for global brainstorming and cooperation on a series of technological breakthroughs to achieve sustainable development . 
By harnessing cutting-edge engineering and new kinds of public-private partnerships , we can hasten the worldwide transition to sustainable technologies , with benefits for rich and poor countries alike - and thereby find the basis for global agreements on climate change that have so far proven elusive .
