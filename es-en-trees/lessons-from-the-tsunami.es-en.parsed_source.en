Lessons from the Tsunami 
There are many lessons that emerge from the tsunami that brought such devastation and loss of life to Asia . 
It demonstrated the power of globalization , as television brought vivid pictures of the destruction to homes around the world . 
Indeed , it is at times like this that the world truly does seem like a global village . 
Of course , it seemed to take somewhat longer for news of the extent of the disaster to reach the Crawford , Texas , ranch of President Bush . 
But , in the end , he decided to interrupt his vacation and offer amounts of aid that were successively revised upwards , in a global competition which promised to benefit those who were desperate for help . 
America &apos;s aid still appeared niggardly when compared with the amounts offered by countries with a fraction of America &apos;s economic wealth . 
Lightly populated Australia offered more than twice America &apos;s assistance , Japan promised almost 50 % more , and Europe pledged more than five times as much . 
This led many observers to reflect on the fact that the world &apos;s richest country was in general the most miserly in foreign assistance - all the more so in comparison to the amount it spends on war and defense . 
The disaster was international , so it was appropriate that the United Nations take the lead in coordinating the relief effort . 
Unfortunately , in an effort that was widely seen as another attempt to undermine multilateralism , the US tried to lead a &quot; core group &quot; driving the assistance program , ignoring ongoing efforts within the region and at the UN . 
Whatever America &apos;s motive , it later wisely decided to join the UN effort . 
The Bush administration &apos;s face-saving rhetoric that it had rushed to push together the core group in the absence of other efforts was quietly let to pass . 
The response of some countries within the region was truly impressive , showing how far they had come in establishing efficient and effective governments . 
Myriad details were addressed : Thailand flew ambassadors to the affected part of the country to help attend to the needs of their citizens , helped those who lost their money and passports return home , provided health care for the injured , set up systems to identify bodies , and dealt with the difficulties posed by shortages of body bags and the lack of cold storage facilities . 
Countries , like Thailand , that felt that they could handle the finances on their own asked that assistance be directed to others . 
They did ask one thing : a reduction of tariff barriers and greater access to markets abroad . 
They didn &apos;t want a handout , only a chance to earn income . 
The response , at least at the time of this column &apos;s writing , has mostly been deafening silence . 
On the other hand , the G-7 made a truly important contribution in offering debt relief . 
This is especially important for Indonesia , which must service a debt of $ 132 billion ( of which $ 70 billion is owed to public creditors or guaranteed by government agencies ) . 
Even without the tsunami , this debt burden would have been an enormous hindrance to the country &apos;s development as it finally recovers from the aftermath of the 1997 financial crisis . 
Indeed , there is a compelling case to be made for Indonesian debt relief in any case , given that much of the debt was incurred in loans to the corrupt Suharto government . 
Lenders knew , or should have known , that not all of the money was going to help Indonesian development . 
Moreover , some of the debt was incurred as part of the 1997-1998 crisis , which was aggravated and deepened by IMF-imposed policies . 
No one pretends that we can prevent or alter the forces of nature . 
Rather , we have to learn to cope with them . 
There are now calls for improved tsunami early warning systems . 
But in one area , global warming , we have already received an early warning . 
Most countries have recognized this , coming together in Rio and Kyoto to do something about it - not enough , but the Kyoto protocol was intended only as a start . 
Sadly , global warming will likely destroy some of the same countries ravaged by the tsunami . 
Low lying islands like the Maldives will become submerged . 
We are , however , still not a global village . 
After first disputing that there was scientific evidence of the problem , the largest polluter in the world , the US , is now simply refusing to do anything about it ( other than preaching voluntary restraint - of which there is little evidence , at least in America ) . 
The international community has yet to figure out what to do with an aberrant member who fails to live up to its responsibilities as a global citizen . 
Optimists say that technology will solve the problem . 
Realists observe that in the long race between the environment and technology , it appears that technology has so far been losing . 
Nature , as we have learned from the tsunami , has its own timetable . 
Unless we learn how to respect it , we will all miss the boat .
