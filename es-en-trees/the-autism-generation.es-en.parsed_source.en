The Autism Generation 
SAN DIEGO - Not long ago , autism was among the rarest of disorders , afflicting only one child in every 2,000-5,000 . 
This changed dramatically with the publication in 1994 of DSM IV ( the manual of psychiatric diagnosis widely used around the world ) . 
Soon , rates exploded to about 1 per 100 . 
And a large study in South Korea recently reported a further jump to 1 in 38 - an astounding 3 % of the general population was labeled autistic . 
What is causing this epidemic and where are we headed ? 
The natural reaction to any plague is panic . 
Parents are now fearful that every delay in speech or socialization presages autism . 
Childless couples decide to avoid having kids . 
Parents with autistic children are desolate and desperate to determine its cause . 
The British physician Andrew Wakefield &apos;s vaccine theory became wildly popular among parents , many of whom began to withhold vaccination ( thus subjecting their own and other children to the risk of entirely preventable , and sometimes serious , illnesses ) . 
Vaccination seemed a plausible cause because of the fortuitous correlation between getting shots and the onset of symptoms . 
Wakefield &apos;s work has now been thoroughly discredited as incorrect and dishonest science . 
But fear of autism is so great , and the reactions to it so irrational , that in some circles Wakefield continues to be revered as a false prophet . 
Other factors must be behind the sharp rise in the diagnosis . 
Before DSM IV , autism was among the most narrowly and clearly defined of disorders . 
Symptoms had to begin before age three and comprised a striking and unmistakable combination of severe language deficits , inability to form social relationships , and a preoccupation with a very narrow set of stereotyped behaviors . 
In preparing DSM IV , we decided to add a new category describing a milder ( and therefore much more difficult to define and distinguish ) form of autism , called Asperger &apos;s Disorder . 
This seemed necessary because some ( still quite rare ) children presented with more or less normal language development , but with grave social and behavioral difficulties . 
We knew that Asperger &apos;s would likely triple the rate of autistic disorders to about 1 per 500-1,000 , but this doesn &apos;t explain the new rate of 1 per 38 . 
A second possible explanation for the explosion in autism is that previously missed cases are now being more accurately diagnosed . 
This is probably a factor , but again only a minor one . 
Perhaps , then , an environmental toxin is causing an epidemic outbreak of autism . 
This has been the most popular theory , but it , too , is a small factor , at best . 
There has been no sudden environmental change since 1994 to account for an explosion in rates . 
This doesn &apos;t entirely disprove an environmental vector , but it does make the odds quite remote - especially since there is a far more plausible explanation . 
The most likely cause of the autism epidemic is that autism has become fashionable - a popular fad diagnosis . 
Once rare and unmistakable , the term is now used loosely to describe people who do not really satisfy the narrow criteria intended for it by DSM IV . 
Autism now casts a wide net , catching much milder problems that previously went undiagnosed altogether or were given other labels . 
Autism is no longer seen as an extremely disabling condition , and many creative and normally eccentric people have discovered their inner autistic self . 
This dramatic swing from under- to overdiagnosis has been fueled by widespread publicity , Internet support and advocacy groups , and the fact that expensive school services are provided only for those who have received the diagnosis . 
The Korean study , for example , was financed by an autism advocacy group , which could barely contain its enthusiasm at the high rates that were reported . 
The Korean study paid no attention to the bias that haunts all epidemiological studies , which always overestimate pathology rates by including as disorder even very mild presentations that do not have clinical significance . 
It is entirely plausible that 3 % of the population may have some smidgen of autism , but it is entirely implausible that so many would have symptoms severe enough to qualify as an autistic disorder . 
Reported rates should be regarded as an upper limit , not as a true reflection of the rate of actual mental disorder . 
Human nature , neurological illness , and psychiatric disorder all change very slowly , if at all . 
Environmental toxins do not usually just pop out of nowhere to make a condition 100 times more common than it was less than 20 years before . 
A more plausible scenario is that DSM IV gave autism purchase by introducing a milder form that is close to the extremely populous boundary of normality . 
Then autism took flight on the wings of definitional diffusion , internet contagion , financial incentive , and na√Øve interpretation of epidemiological results . 
The autism &quot; epidemic &quot; is set to spread further starting in May 2013 , when the next revision of the diagnostic manual ( DSM 5 ) will be published . 
The DSM 5 definition of an &quot; autistic spectrum &quot; will cast an even wider net , capturing many people now considered to be normal or to have another disorder . 
Their symptoms will not have changed - just the label .
