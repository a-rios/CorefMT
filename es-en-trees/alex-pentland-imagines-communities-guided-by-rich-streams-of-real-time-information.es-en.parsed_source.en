Living Big Data 
CAMBRIDGE - Big data is made from the digital trail that we leave behind when we use credit cards , mobile phones , or the Web . 
Used carefully and accurately , these data give us unprecedented scope to understand our society , and improve the way we live and work . 
But what works in theory may not translate well in the real world , where complex human interactions cannot always be captured , even by the most sophisticated models . 
Big data requires us to experiment on a big scale . 
My own laboratory , for example , is building a Web site which , based on Google maps , uses society &apos;s digital trail to map poverty , infant mortality , crime rates , changes in GDP , and other social indicators , neighborhood by neighborhood - all of which will be updated daily . 
This new capability allows viewers to see , for example , where government initiatives are working or failing . 
But , while such impressive visualization tools can dramatically enhance transparency and public knowledge , they are surprisingly limited when applied to solving society &apos;s problems . 
One reason is that such rich streams of data encourage spurious correlations . 
Even the use of the normal scientific method no longer works ; given so many measurements , and so many more potential connections among what &apos;s being measured , our standard statistical tools generate nonsensical results . 
Without knowing all possible alternatives , we cannot form a limited , testable set of clear hypotheses . 
And if we can no longer rely on laboratory experiments to test causality , we must test it in the real world , using massive volumes of real-time data . 
This involves moving beyond the closed , question-and-answer process typical of the lab , and applying our ideas in society , earlier and more frequently than ever before . 
To see how things work in reality , we must construct living laboratories - that is , communities willing to try new ways of doing things ( to be blunt , to act as guinea pigs ) . 
An example of such a living lab is the &quot; open data city , &quot; which I launched with the city of Trento in Italy , along with Telecom Italia , Telef√≥nica , the research university Fondazione Bruno Kessler , the Institute for Data Driven Design , and local companies . 
Importantly , this living lab has the approval and informed consent of all involved ; they understand that they are participating in a gigantic experiment whose goal is to create a better way of living . 
One major challenge for a living lab is to protect individual privacy without diminishing the potential for better government . 
The Trento lab , for example , will pilot my proposed &quot; New Deal on Data , &quot; which gives users greater control over their personal data through trust-network software such as our open PDS ( Personal Data Store ) system . 
We hope that the ability to share data safely , while protecting privacy , will encourage individuals , companies , and governments to communicate their ideas widely , and so increase productivity and creativity across the entire city . 
But the biggest difficulty in using big data to build a better society is being able to develop a human-scale , intuitive understanding of social physics . 
Although dense , continuous data and modern computation allow us to map many details about society , and to explain how communities might work , such raw mathematical models contain too many variables and complex relationships for most people to understand . 
What is needed is some kind of dialogue between human intuition and the compelling reality of big data - a dialogue that is currently absent from management and government systems . 
If big data is to be deployed effectively , people must be able to understand and interpret the relevant statistics . 
This calls for a new understanding of human behavior and social dynamics that goes beyond traditional economic and political models . 
Only by developing the science and language of social physics will we be able to make a world of big data a world in which we want to live .
