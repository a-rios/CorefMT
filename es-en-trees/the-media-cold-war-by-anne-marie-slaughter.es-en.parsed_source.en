The Media Cold War 
PRINCETON - An information war has erupted around the world . 
The battle lines are drawn between those governments that regard the free flow of information , and the ability to access it , as a matter of fundamental human rights , and those that regard official control of information as a fundamental sovereign prerogative . 
The contest is being waged institutionally in organizations like the International Telecommunications Union ( ITU ) and daily in countries like Syria . 
The sociologist Philip N. Howard recently used the term &quot; new cold war &quot; to describe &quot; battles between broadcast media outlets and social-media upstarts , which have very different approaches to news production , ownership , and censorship . &quot; 
Because broadcasting requires significant funding , it is more centralized - and thus much more susceptible to state control . 
Social media , by contrast , transforms anyone with a mobile phone into a potential roving monitor of government deeds or misdeeds , and are hard to shut down without shutting down the entire Internet . 
Surveying struggles between broadcast and social media in Russia , Syria , and Saudi Arabia , Howard concludes that , notwithstanding their different media cultures , all three governments strongly back state-controlled broadcasting . 
These intra-media struggles are interesting and important . 
The way that information circulates does reflect , as Howard argues , a conception of how a society / polity should be organized . 
But an even deeper difference concerns the fundamental issue of who owns information in the first place . 
In January 2010 , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton proclaimed that the United States &quot; stand &#91; s &#93; for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to information and ideas . &quot; 
She linked that stance not only to the US Constitution &apos;s First Amendment , which protects freedom of expression and freedom of the press , but also to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which holds that all people have the right &quot; to seek , receive , and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . &quot; 
Many governments &quot; determination to &quot; erect electronic barriers &quot; to block their citizens &quot; efforts to access the full resources of the Internet , she said , means that &quot; a new information curtain is descending across our world . &quot; 
This larger struggle is playing out in many places , including the ITU , which will convene 190 countries in Dubai in December to update an international telecommunications treaty first adopted in 1988 . 
Although many of the treaty &apos;s details are highly technical , involving the routing of telecommunications , various governments have submitted proposals to amend the treaty that include provisions aimed at facilitating government censorship of the Internet . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has been open about his desire to use the ITU &quot; to establish international control &quot; over the Internet , thereby superseding current arrangements , which leave Internet governance in the hands of private groups like the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and the Internet Engineering Task Force . 
The US would never sign a treaty that fundamentally changed Internet governance arrangements , but the point is that many governments will try to use the treaty process to increase their ability to control the information that their citizens can access . 
On the ground , governments are often still primarily focused on blocking information about what they are doing . 
One of the Syrian government &apos;s first moves after it began shooting protesters , for example , was to expel all foreign journalists . 
Several weeks ago , the government of Tajikistan blocked YouTube and reportedly shut down communications networks in a remote region where government forces were battling an opposition group . 
The Chinese government barred all foreign journalists from Tibet when it cracked down hard on protesters before the 2008 Olympics . 
These more traditional tactics can now be supplemented with new tools for misinformation . 
For close followers of the Syrian conflict , tracking key reporters and opposition representatives on Twitter can be a surreal experience . 
Two weeks ago , Ausama Monajed , a Syrian strategic communications consultant who sends out a steady stream of information and links to opposition activities in Syria , suddenly started sending out pro-government propaganda . 
The Saudi-owned satellite news channel Al Arabiya has also reported the hacking of its Twitter feed by the &quot; Electronic Syrian Army , &quot; a shadowy group most likely comprised of free-lance operatives with the direct or indirect support of the Syrian government . 
It is one thing to read about sophisticated cyber-war capabilities ; it is quite another to see the online identities of familiar people or Web sites suddenly hijacked . 
In the many manifestations of the ongoing and growing information war ( s ) , the pro-freedom-of-information forces need a new weapon . 
A government &apos;s banning of journalists or blocking of news and social-media Web sites that were previously allowed should itself be regarded as an early warning sign of a crisis meriting international scrutiny . 
The presumption should be that governments with nothing to hide have nothing to lose by allowing their citizens and internationally recognized media to report on their actions . 
To give this presumption teeth , it should be included in international trade and investment agreements . 
Imagine if the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , and regional development banks suspended financing as soon as a government pulled down an information curtain . 
Suppose foreign investors wrote contracts providing that the expulsion and banning of foreign journalists or widespread blocking of access to international news sources and social media constituted a sign of political risk sufficient to suspend investor obligations under the contract . 
Americans say that sunlight is the best disinfectant . 
Citizens &quot; access to information is an essential tool to hold governments accountable . 
Government efforts to manipulate or block information should be presumed to be an abuse of power - one intended to mask many other abuses .
