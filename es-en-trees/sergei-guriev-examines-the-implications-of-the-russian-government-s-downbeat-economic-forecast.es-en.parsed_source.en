Russia &apos;s New Stagnation 
PARIS - In early November , the Russian government released its latest macroeconomic forecast . 
It could not have been an easy decision : Whereas President Vladimir Putin and his government campaigned in 2012 on a promise that the Russian economy would grow at 5-6 % per year during his six-year term , the growth rate is now expected to average just 2.8 % from 2013 to 2020 . 
Minister of Economic Development Alexei Ulyukaev explicitly acknowledged that achieving the targets set by Putin &quot; will take longer . &quot; 
In some cases , that means much longer . 
For example , in May 2012 , Putin promised to increase Russia &apos;s labor productivity by 50 % by 2018 ; the current forecast does not envision this outcome even by 2025 . 
For independent observers , the ministry &apos;s grim forecast comes as no surprise . 
Judging by low stock prices and high capital outflows , investors were already betting against high growth rates . 
Now Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev are pessimistic as well . 
Medvedev , who had been publicly forecasting 5 % annual growth as recently as January , told foreign investors in October that this year &apos;s growth rate would not exceed 2 % . 
Previously , the government blamed the country &apos;s economic problems on the global slowdown . 
Today , that argument makes little sense . 
The global economy - and the US economy , in particular - is growing faster than expected , and world oil prices are above $ 100 per barrel . 
The ministry &apos;s forecast answers the perennial &quot; who is to blame &quot; question very clearly : the slowdown reflects Russia &apos;s own &quot; internal problems . &quot; 
The ministry &apos;s baseline forecast assumes that the price of oil - Russia &apos;s main export - will grow at 9 % per year in real terms over the next 17 years , or more than three times the forecast for Russia &apos;s annual GDP growth . 
A week after the ministry &apos;s forecast was released , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - Russia &apos;s largest foreign direct investor - followed suit , cutting its growth forecast for Russia to 1.3 % in 2013 and 2.5 % in 2014 . 
The EBRD &apos;s view was even more straightforward : the slowdown is the result of the Russian government &apos;s lack of structural reform . 
Poor governance , weak rule of law , and state-owned companies &quot; assault on competition undermine Russia &apos;s business climate and cause capital flight . 
Russia &apos;s ruling elite understands very well that reforms are needed ; indeed , the Putin-Medvedev era , now in its 14th year , has suffered no shortage of reform programs . 
Back in 2008 , for example , Aleh Tsyvinski and I praised then-President Medvedev for his seemingly credible commitment to implementing the changes that Russia &apos;s economy needs . 
But Medvedev &apos;s one-term presidency - like Putin &apos;s administrations before and since - did not deliver on these promises . 
The Russian government &apos;s reluctance to fight corruption and strengthen the country &apos;s legal institutions reflects a perverse - yet stable - political equilibrium . 
In 2010 , Tsyvinski and I predicted a &quot; 70-80 scenario &quot; in Russia in the coming years : As oil prices , which had plummeted to $ 40 per barrel , recovered and surpassed $ 70-80 / barrel , Russia would return to the stagnation of the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s . 
Sure enough , GDP growth from 2010 to 2012 , though averaging a respectable 4 % , turned out to have been driven by the post-crisis recovery and the further increase in oil prices to $ 100 / barrel . 
Now all of these short-term factors have been exhausted , and a Brezhnev-like period of stagnation has begun . 
Russia &apos;s political elite understands that the economy is capable of 5-6 % annual growth . 
The problem is that the reforms needed to achieve such growth - fighting corruption , protecting property rights , privatization , and integration into the global economy - directly threaten the elite &apos;s ability to hold on to power and extract rents . 
For those in power , a big piece of a shrinking pie is preferable to no piece of a growing one , which is what most of the current elite would receive under a fair legal system with clear rules and predictable enforcement . 
Seen against this background , the November release of the ministry &apos;s grim forecast for growth is both surprising and welcome . 
At the very least , the authorities deserve praise for frankly admitting that Putin &apos;s promises are impossible to fulfill , rather than continuing to ignore , sugar-coat , or divert attention from the evidence . 
The growing realism of the government &apos;s internal - and public - discourse is no small matter . 
It is finally leading , for example , to the much-needed discussion of budget cuts . 
What this - and officials &quot; new candor more broadly - means for Vladimir Putin &apos;s political future remains to be seen .
