Autumn &apos;s Known Unknowns 
NEW YORK - During the height of the Iraq war , then-US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld spoke of &quot; known unknowns &quot; - foreseeable risks whose realization is uncertain . 
Today , the global economy is facing many known unknowns , most of which stem from policy uncertainty . 
In the United States , three sources of policy uncertainty will come to a head this autumn . 
For starters , it remains unclear whether the Federal Reserve will begin to &quot; taper &quot; its open-ended quantitative easing ( QE ) in September or later , how fast it will reduce its purchases of long-term assets , and when and how fast it will start to raise interest rates from their current zero level . 
There is also the question of who will succeed Ben Bernanke as Fed Chairman . 
Finally , yet another partisan struggle over America &apos;s debt ceiling could increase the risk of a government shutdown if the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies cannot agree on a budget . 
The first two sources of uncertainty have already affected markets . 
The rise in US long-term interest rates - from a low of 1.6 % in May to recent peaks above 2.9 % - has been driven by market fears that the Fed will taper QE too soon and too fast , and by the uncertainty surrounding Bernanke &apos;s successor . 
So far , investors have been complacent about the risks posed by the looming budget fight . 
They believe that - as in the past - the fiscal showdown will end with a midnight compromise that avoids both default and a government shutdown . 
But investors seem to underestimate how dysfunctional US national politics has become . 
With a majority of the Republican Party on a jihad against government spending , fiscal explosions this autumn cannot be ruled out . 
Uncertainties abound in other advanced economies as well . 
Germany &apos;s general election appears likely to produce a repeat of the current government coalition of Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s Christian Democratic Union and the Free Democrats , with opinion polls suggesting that a grand coalition between the CDU and the Social Democrats is less likely . 
In the former case , current German policies toward the eurozone crisis will not change , despite austerity fatigue in the eurozone &apos;s periphery and bailout fatigue in its core . 
Political risks in the eurozone &apos;s periphery include the collapse of Italy &apos;s government and a fresh election as a result of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s criminal conviction . 
Greece &apos;s ruling coalition could collapse as well , and political tensions may rise even higher in Spain and Portugal . 
On monetary policy , the European Central Bank &apos;s forward guidance - the commitment to keep interest rates at a low level for a long time - is too little too late and has not prevented a rise in short- and long-term borrowing costs , which could stifle the eurozone &apos;s already-anemic economic recovery . 
Whether the ECB will ease policy more aggressively is also uncertain . 
Outside of the eurozone , the strength of the United Kingdom &apos;s recovery and the Bank of England &apos;s soft forward guidance have led to similar &quot; unwarranted &quot; increases in interest rates , which the BoE , like the ECB , seems unable to prevent in the absence of more muscular action . 
In Japan , the policy uncertainty concerns whether the third arrow of Abenomics - structural reforms and trade liberalization to boost potential growth - will be implemented , and whether the expected rise in the consumption tax in 2014 will choke economic recovery . 
In China , November &apos;s Third Plenum of the Communist Party Central Committee will show whether China is serious about reforms aimed at shifting from investment-led to consumption-led growth . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s slowdown has contributed to the end of the commodity super-cycle , which , together with the sharp rise in long-term interest rates ( owing to the scare of an early Fed exit from QE ) , has led to economic and financial stresses in many emerging-market economies . 
These economies - the BRICS ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) and others - were overhyped for too long . 
Favorable external conditions - the effect of China &apos;s strong growth on higher commodity prices and easy money from yield-hungry advanced-economy investors - led to a partly artificial boom . 
Now that the party is over , the hangover is setting in . 
This is especially true in India , Brazil , Turkey , South Africa , and Indonesia , all of which suffer from multiple macroeconomic and policy weaknesses - large current-account deficits , wide fiscal deficits , slowing growth , and above-target inflation - as well as growing social protest and political uncertainty ahead of elections in the next 12-18 months . 
There are no easy choices : defending the currency by hiking interest rates would kill growth and harm banks and corporate firms ; loosening monetary policy to boost growth might push their currencies into free-fall , causing a spike in inflation and jeopardizing their ability to attract capital to finance their external deficits . 
There are two major geopolitical uncertainties as well . 
First , will the looming military strikes by the US and its allies against Syria be limited in scope and time , or will they trigger a wider military confrontation ? 
The last thing that a fragile global economy needs now is another round of peak oil prices . 
Second , a year ago the US convinced Israel to give its non-military approach to Iran &apos;s nuclear-weapons ambitions time to bear fruit . 
But , after a year of economic sanctions and negotiations with no result , Israel &apos;s patience on what it regards as an existential issue is wearing thin . 
Even short of an actual military conflict - which could double oil prices overnight - the resumption of saber-rattling by Israel and the war of words between the two sides could lead to a sharp rise in energy costs . 
The looming known unknowns are plentiful . 
Some outcomes may be more positive , or at least less damaging , than expected . 
But the realization this autumn of even some of the risks described here could derail the global economy &apos;s still-wobbly recovery . 
And the meta-risk of policy mistakes and accidents remains very high .
