Collaborating with Corruption 
TIRANA - Too often over the past decade , the United States , the European Union , and the United Nations have chosen to look the other way in Albanian-populated areas of the Balkans , willfully giving free rein to corrupt political and military officials in the vain hope of gaining local support for international efforts to strengthen &quot; regional stability . &quot; 
This &quot; see-no-evil &quot; policy has yielded precious little stability . 
And it has allowed Kosovo , Albania , and Macedonia to linger on the crumbling edge of the &quot; failed state &quot; abyss . 
These countries - not to mention their Balkan neighbors , Greece included - need to be Europeanized . 
They need the rule of law . 
They need good governance . 
They need transparency and accountability . 
They need to wean themselves from the poisonous rhetoric of ethnic nationalism substituting as patriotism . 
This cultural transformation will require international unity in support of robust efforts to root out the rot and stop narrow-minded local political figures from implementing policies that are dangerous both to their countries and the region . 
Over the past few months , the EU &apos;s &quot; rule of law &quot; mission in Kosovo , EULEX , has begun doing what the UN could have and should have done long ago : investigating top local Albanian officials and their involvement in bribery and money laundering , as well as their ties to organized crime . 
Many of these officials are former leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army , a militia that led an insurrection against Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s Serbia . 
One of these officials , Fatmir Limaj , a former KLA commander , is now Kosovo &apos;s Minister of Transportation and Telecommunication , a portfolio fat with contract money . 
EULEX is investigating whether Limaj and other ministry personnel accepted bribes in exchange for contracts to build roads . 
But EULEX should not stop there . 
It should expand its net to include drug smuggling , human trafficking , and the fate of missing victims from the war and its aftermath . 
EULEX &apos;s effort has received vocal support from a Kosovar public that is fed up with corruption , and counting on the investigations to yield arrests of dirty officials . 
( There is even a Facebook page in support of EULEX &apos;s investigations . ) 
The investigations , however , have received only partial support from the international community . 
Political leaders everywhere in the Balkans are adept at exploiting such divisions . 
The US , which enjoys immense popularity among Albanians for obvious reasons , should immediately and unambiguously throw its muscle behind EULEX and its investigations . 
It should also stand foursquare behind Prime Minister Hashim Thaci &apos;s announced anti-corruption campaign , while monitoring it to ensure that it does not degrade into an effort to destroy his political opponents . 
Another round of negotiations between the governments of Serbia and Kosovo over a number of issues will soon begin . 
The last thing needed in this situation is US-EU get-out-of-jail-free cards for corrupt Kosovo negotiators in exchange for concessions that will benefit Serbia . 
Things are little better in Albania , whose economy faces meltdown because it is reliant upon debt-ridden Greece and Italy . 
Indeed , 70 % of Albania &apos;s banks are Greek-owned , and more than a million Albanians work in Greece and Italy to earn money to send home . 
Smarting from a loss in a tainted election , Albania &apos;s political opposition , obdurate and un-comprising , is boycotting the country &apos;s parliament and holding weekly demonstrations at a time crucial to Albania &apos;s EU-accession bid and its handling of a falling economy . 
Both the government and the opposition need to grow up and stop putting narrow personal interests above those of the country and its people . 
In Macedonia , the conservative Macedonian Slav-run government has for years dragged its feet on implementing the equal-rights provisions of the Ohrid Agreement , reached in 2001 with the leaders of the ethnic Albanian minority to end a violent insurrection by the National Liberation Army , an ethnic Albanian militia . 
Demonstrators have taken to the streets of the capital , Skopje , shouting that the government has opted for a policy of open discrimination on &quot; ethnic and religious grounds . &quot; 
The NLA has begun to rearm . 
In May , Macedonian police shot and killed NLA members as they were trying to smuggling weapons across the border from Kosovo . 
The three countries are completely reliant upon US and EU political and financial support . 
They should use their clout to pressure Macedonia &apos;s government to speed up implementation of the promised reforms . 
Albanian political leaders in Kosovo and Macedonia should be pressured to take effective efforts to preventing the rise of armed movements . 
The US and EU aid agencies are rightly supporting rule of law and good governance programs in the region . 
But , until US and EU regional policies are in sync with their aid programs , the aid will be seen , yet again , as a reward to corrupt officials for playing nice with their neighbors at a heavy cost to their citizens .
