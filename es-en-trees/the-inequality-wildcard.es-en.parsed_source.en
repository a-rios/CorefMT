The Inequality Wildcard 
DAVOS - As the dramatic events in North Africa continue to unfold , many observers outside the Arab world smugly tell themselves that it is all about corruption and political repression . 
But high unemployment , glaring inequality , and soaring prices for basic commodities are also a huge factor . 
So observers should not just be asking how far similar events will spread across the region ; they should be asking themselves what kind of changes might be coming at home in the face of similar , if not quite so extreme , economic pressures . 
Within countries , inequality of income , wealth , and opportunity is arguably greater than at any time in the last century . 
Across Europe , Asia , and the Americas , corporations are bulging with cash as their relentless drive for efficiency continues to yield huge profits . 
Yet workers &quot; share of the pie is falling , thanks to high unemployment , shortened working hours , and stagnant wages . 
Paradoxically , cross-country measures of income and wealth inequality are actually falling , thanks to continuing robust growth in emerging markets . 
But most people care far more about how well they are doing relative to their neighbors than to citizens of distant lands . 
The rich are mostly doing well . 
Global stock markets are back . 
Many countries are seeing vigorous growth in prices for housing , commercial real estate , or both . 
Resurgent prices for commodities are creating huge revenues for owners of mines and oil fields , even as price spikes for basic staples are sparking food riots , if not wholesale revolutions , in the developing world . 
The Internet and the financial sector continue to spawn new multi-millionaires and even billionaires at a staggering pace . 
Yet high and protracted unemployment plagues many less-skilled workers . 
For example , in financially distressed Spain , unemployment now exceeds 20 % . 
It cannot help that the government is simultaneously being forced to absorb new austerity measures to deal with the country &apos;s precarious debt burden . 
Indeed , given record-high public-debt levels in many countries , few governments have substantial scope to address inequality through further income redistribution . 
Countries such as Brazil already have such high levels of transfer payments from rich to poor that further moves would undermine fiscal stability and anti-inflation credibility . 
Countries such as China and Russia , with similarly high inequality , have more scope for increasing redistribution . 
But leaders in both countries have been reluctant to move boldly for fear of destabilizing growth . 
Germany must worry not only about its own vulnerable citizens , but also about how to find the resources to bail out its southern neighbors in Europe . 
The causes of growing inequality within countries are well understood , and it is not necessary to belabor them here . 
We live in an era in which globalization expands the market for ultra-talented individuals but competes away the income of ordinary employees . 
Competition among countries for skilled individuals and profitable industries , in turn , constrains governments &quot; abilities to maintain high tax rates on the wealthy . 
Social mobility is further impeded as the rich shower their children with private education and after-school help , while the poorest in many countries cannot afford even to let their children stay in school . 
Writing in the nineteenth century , Karl Marx famously observed inequality trends in his day and concluded that capitalism could not indefinitely sustain itself politically . 
Eventually , workers would rise up and overthrow the system . 
Outside Cuba , North Korea , and a few left-wing universities around the world , no one takes Marx seriously anymore . 
Contrary to his predictions , capitalism spawned ever-higher standards of living for more than a century , while attempts to implement radically different systems have fallen spectacularly short . 
Yet , with inequality reaching levels similar to 100 years ago , the status quo has to be vulnerable . 
Instability can express itself anywhere . 
It was just over four decades ago that urban riots and mass demonstrations rocked the developed world , ultimately catalyzing far-reaching social and political reforms . 
Yes , the problems facing Egypt and Tunisia today are far more profound than in many other countries . 
Corruption and failure to embrace meaningful political reform have become acute shortcomings . 
Yet it would be very wrong to suppose that gaping inequality is stable as long as it arises through innovation and growth . 
How , exactly , will change unfold , and what form will a new social compact ultimately assume ? 
It is difficult to speculate , though in most countries , the process will be peaceful and democratic . 
What is clear is that inequality is not just a long-term issue . 
Concerns about the impact of income inequality are already constraining fiscal and monetary policy in developed and developing countries alike as they attempt to extricate themselves from the hyper-stimulative policies adopted during the financial crisis . 
More importantly , it is very likely that countries &quot; abilities to navigate the rising social tensions generated by gaping inequality could separate the winners and losers in the next round of globalization . 
Inequality is the big wildcard in the next decade of global growth , and not just in North Africa .
