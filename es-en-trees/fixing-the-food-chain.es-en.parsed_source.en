Fixing the Food Chain 
COPENHAGEN - The global food system is in disarray . 
Four years ago , a 30-year trend of decreasing food prices rapidly reversed course . 
Grain prices have more than doubled since 2004 , and prices for most other foods have increased significantly . 
Add unsustainable management of natural resources , emerging negative effects of climate change , and sharply rising prices for fertilizers and energy , and we are faced with the most severe global food crisis since the early 1970 &quot; s . 
Dramatic price hikes reflect several factors : adverse weather in key food production areas , rapid increase in demand for meats and dairy products , higher oil prices , draw-downs of food stocks , greater use of food commodities for bio-fuel , and failure to invest in rural infrastructure , research and technology , and other public goods needed to facilitate agricultural growth in developing countries . 
The skyrocketing cost of food has resulted in more starvation among the poor , reduced purchasing power among the non-poor , and food riots in more than 30 countries . 
The key lesson to learn is that insufficient investment in science and inappropriate government policies lead to food crises . 
To avoid these shortcomings in the future , the world &apos;s farmers and food processors must be helped to produce more food to meet increasing demand fueled by growth in world population and incomes . 
Moreover , they must produce more with less land and water , at reasonable prices , and without damaging natural resources or worsening climate change . 
But are governments getting the message ? 
I believe so . 
Hunger is not a new phenomenon , but as long as the rural poor endure it in silence , as they have for a long time , governments can comfortably ignore it . 
Food riots by urban populations , on the other hand , threaten what governments care about the most : their legitimacy . 
Developing countries invest only slightly more that 0.5 % of the value of their agricultural production in agricultural research . 
An increase to 2 % is warranted . 
Modern science should focus on sustainable increases in land and water productivity , management of production risks caused by droughts , floods , pests , and on mitigation and adaption to climate change . 
Drought-tolerant and pest-resistant crop varieties , disease-resistant livestock , and high-yield agricultural production systems that use less water and capture nitrogen from the air are but a few examples of the kind of technologies needed . 
More research is also needed to improve the nutritional quality of staple foods by fortifying them with iron , vitamin A , and zinc to help solve widespread micronutrient deficiencies . 
We must also strengthen food safety from production to consumption , including improvements in our understanding of the interaction between the food system and human health , particularly zoonotic diseases and the effects of pesticides . 
Research to identify alternative energy sources to stop the conversion of maize , soybeans , oil palm , and other foods to bio-fuel should become another high priority . 
Most of the people at risk of hunger and malnutrition live in rural areas . 
They need access to roads , markets , appropriate institutions and technology , primary health care , and education if they are to escape poverty and hunger and produce more food for an increasing world population . 
Both public and private investments are needed to provide such access . 
Government action is needed to make markets work in developing countries and to give farmers and market agents access to appropriate technology and knowledge . 
Unfortunately , rapidly falling food prices during the 30-year period since the food crisis of the early 1970 &quot; s gave governments a convenient excuse for doing little or nothing . 
Public policy is needed in many other areas , including legislation to incorporate environmental costs into food prices , thereby encouraging sustainable production , as well as incentives and regulations to promote more efficient water use . 
National and international bio-safety regimes should be implemented to guide the development , application , and trade of modern technology and genetically modified food . 
Government subsidies that increase the use of food commodities such as maize , soybeans , and palm oil for bio-fuel should be discontinued . 
International institutions are needed to regulate globalization and ensure trade competition . 
Trade-distorting agricultural policies , including those in the United States , the European Union , and Japan , should be eliminated . 
While poverty reduction is the best way to reduce fertility rates , access to reproductive health care is critically important for helping families limit the number of children they have to the number they desire . 
The world &apos;s natural resources are sufficient to produce the food needed in the foreseeable future without damaging the environment , but only if governments follow enlightened policies and science is put to work for the food system .
