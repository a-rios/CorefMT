Why Do Jews Succeed ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - In recent decades , economists have been struggling to make use of the concept of human capital , often defined as the abilities , skills , knowledge , and dispositions that make for economic success . 
Yet those who use the term often assume that to conceptualize a phenomenon is a first step to manipulating it . 
Simon Kuznets , one of the twentieth century &apos;s great economists , was a pioneer of human-capital theory . 
Not long before he died , Kuznets recommended to a young colleague that one ought study the role of Jews in economic life . 
By and large , economists and other social scientists have neglected the history of Jews and capitalism , for reasons that are understandable , though unconvincing . 
For most economists , the extent to which modern capitalism has been shaped by earlier cultural predispositions is a source of puzzlement at best , if not merely a factor to be dismissed . 
Such cultural considerations simply do not fit into the categories in which equation-fixated economists are predisposed to think . 
When economists examine &quot; human capital , &quot; they prefer measurable criteria such as years of schooling . 
To the extent that human capital involves character traits and varieties of &quot; know-how &quot; that are transmitted within the realms of the family and the community , rather than by formal education , it becomes both methodologically elusive and difficult to manipulate by public policy . 
A look at the historical experience of the Jews shows that while most Jews were mired in poverty at the beginning of the twentieth century , over time they tended to do disproportionately well in societies that allowed them to compete on an equal basis . 
That was the case first in central and western Europe , and then in the United States . 
They did particularly well in commerce . 
In search of economic niches not already occupied by others , Jews frequently created markets for new products and services . 
They pioneered new retail institutions , from department stores to box stores . 
The fastest growing sectors of the economy since the late nineteenth century have been those loosely classified as &quot; service industries , &quot; often involving the dissemination of information and entertainment - activities in which Jews have been especially prominent , from publishing to vaudeville and from movies to commercial sports . 
They also tended to do disproportionately well in the learned professions - such as medicine , law , and accounting - that are so central to modern capitalist society . 
The fact that Jews were long a minority subject to discrimination is sometimes given as a reason for their tendency to devote themselves to commerce , finance , and the professions . 
Yet not all minorities long subject to discrimination necessarily succeed under conditions of market competition . 
There are a number of ways to account for Jews &quot; disproportionate achievement . 
For one thing , Jews had more experience with commerce than most other groups , and the tacit knowledge of buying , selling , and calculating advantage that was passed on in families with ties to business helps explain why Jews tended to be better at it . 
Moreover , in much of Europe , Jews had long been excluded from most of the established economy of land ownership , and from many other fields that were reserved for Christians . 
So they learned to be on the lookout for new opportunities in underserved markets , working as peddlers , for example , or creating new products , or new forms of marketing . 
Social networks also played an important role . 
Jews were spread across many countries , but to some extent shared a common language and a sense of common fate . 
In addition , Jews had a religious culture that promoted universal adult literacy - at least for men - and a culture that respected book learning . 
Those attitudes and dispositions were transferred from religious texts to secular forms of education . 
As a result , Jews were highly oriented toward education , and willing to defer current pleasures and income to obtain more of it . 
Such factors provide a sense of why attention to the history of Jews under capitalism helps us to understand capitalism more generally . 
It reminds us that much of success in a capitalist society is based on cultural and historical factors that produce qualities such as innovativeness , willingness to tolerate risk , and willingness to defer gratification through savings and education . 
These cultural traits are difficult to quantify , so economists are uncomfortable in dealing with them . 
They are often passed down within families , so they elude social policies that are based on the notion that equality of opportunity can be created by government action . 
Exploring the economic history of the Jews also reminds us that groups that are disproportionately successful are met by different political reactions . 
Societies long oriented to economic dynamism tend to welcome the economically successful , viewing them as a source of mutual gains . 
But cultures that tend to resent the economically successful - either as an affront to equality , or on the implicit assumption that the economic gains of some must be at the expense of others - tend to be more hostile toward Jews and given to conspiratorial theories to explain their economic success . 
Most societies lie somewhere along a spectrum between these two poles . 
Some social scientists are wary of calling attention to the reality of disproportionate Jewish economic success for fear of arousing anti-Semitism , or contributing to conspiratorial theories about Jewish economic dominance . 
No doubt , conspiratorial minds will always find fodder for their obsessions .
