Toward a Green New Deal 
LONDON - The global agreement reached in Paris last week is actually the third climate agreement reached in the past month . 
The first happened at the end of November , when a group of billionaires led by Bill Gates , Mark Zuckerberg , and Jeff Bezos announced the creation of a $ 20 billion fund to back clean-energy research . 
On the same day , a group of 20 countries , including the United States , the United Kingdom , Germany , India , China , and Brazil , agreed to double their investment in green energy , to a total of $ 20 billion a year . 
Of the two pre-Paris announcements , it was that of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition ( BEC ) - Gates and his fellow entrepreneurs - that grabbed most of the headlines . 
This is not surprising , given the strong association in the popular imagination between innovation and the private sector . 
If a technological breakthrough is needed in the fight against climate change , whom should we expect to provide it , if not the wizards of Silicon Valley and other hubs of free-market innovation ? 
Gates himself is the first to acknowledge that the public perception is far from accurate . 
&quot; The private sector knows how to build companies , evaluate the potential for success , and take the risks that lead to taking innovative ideas and bringing them to the world , &quot; reads his coalition &apos;s manifesto . 
&quot; But in the current business environment , the risk-reward balance for early-stage investing in potentially transformative energy systems is unlikely to meet the market tests of traditional angel or VC investors . &quot; 
On its own , the free market will not develop new sources of energy fast enough . 
The payoff is still too uncertain . 
Just as in previous technological revolutions , rapid advances in clean energy will require the intervention of a courageous , entrepreneurial state , providing patient , long-term finance that shifts the private sector &apos;s incentives . 
Governments must make bold policy choices that not only level the playing field , but also tilt it toward environmental sustainability . 
Then - and only then - will private financing follow . 
So far , however , austerity has prevented sufficient public financing . 
One hopes that the Paris agreement changes that . 
As with the information technology revolution , advances in clean energy will require the involvement of both the public and the private sector . 
Because we do not yet know which innovations will be the most important in decarbonizing the economy , investment must be allocated to a wide array of choices . 
Long-term , patient finance must also be available to help companies minimize uncertainty and bridge the so-called &quot; Valley of Death &quot; between basic research and commercialization . 
The BEC &apos;s argument - that the &quot; new model will be a public-private partnership between governments , research institutions , and investors &quot; - shines a welcome spotlight on the relationship . 
Unfortunately , however , aside from Gates and his colleagues , there are few signs that the private sector can be counted on to lead the way . 
The energy sector has become over-financialized ; it is spending more on share buybacks than on research and development in low-carbon innovation . 
The energy giants ExxonMobil and General Electric are the first and tenth largest corporate buyers of their own shares . 
Meanwhile , according to the International Energy Agency , just 16 % of investment in the US energy sector was spent on renewable or nuclear energy . 
Left to their own devices , oil companies seem to prefer extracting hydrocarbons from the deepest confines of the earth to channeling their profits into clean-energy alternatives . 
Meanwhile , government R &amp; D budgets have been declining in recent years - a trend driven partly by under-appreciation of the state &apos;s role in fostering innovation and growth , and more recently by austerity in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis . 
Tight budgets are straining the agencies that could be driving path-breaking innovation . 
The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) was a catalyst for the IT revolution . 
By contrast , the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy ( ARPA-E ) has a 2015 budget of $ 280 million - barely a tenth of DARPA &apos;s . 
In 1981 , energy accounted for 11 % of the total US public R &amp; D budget . 
Today , it accounts for just 4 % . 
Meanwhile , problematic demand-side policies are also in crisis , impeding the deployment of existing renewable-energy technologies . 
The main public-sector bodies playing a leading role in promoting the diffusion of green-energy technologies are state development banks . 
Indeed , Germany &apos;s KfW , the China Development Bank , the European Investment Bank , and Brazil &apos;s BNDES are four of the top ten investors in renewable energy , amounting to 15 % of total asset finance . 
The public sector can - and should - do much more . 
For example , subsidies received by energy corporations could be made conditional on a greater percentage of profits being invested in low-carbon innovations . 
After all , it was this kind of condition - imposed on the US telephone company AT &amp; T in the early twentieth century , in exchange for being allowed to retain its monopoly - that led to the creation of Bell Labs , a crucial incubator of innovation . 
Similarly , while charitable donations by billionaires certainly should be welcomed , companies should also be made to pay a reasonable amount of taxes . 
After all , as the BEC &apos;s manifesto points out , &quot; current governmental funding levels for clean energy are simply insufficient to meet the challenges before us . &quot; 
And yet , in the UK , for example , Facebook paid just Â£ 4,327 in tax in 2014 , far less than many individual taxpayers . 
The willingness of Gates and other business leaders to commit themselves and their money to the promotion of clean energy is admirable . 
The Paris deal is also good news . 
But they are not enough . 
If the low-carbon revolution is to be achieved , we will need both the public and private sectors to commit more fully to green innovation , from both the supply and demand sides .
