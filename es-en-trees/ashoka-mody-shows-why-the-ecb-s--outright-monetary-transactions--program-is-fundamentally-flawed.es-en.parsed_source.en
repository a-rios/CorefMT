The ECB &apos;s Bridge Too Far 
PRINCETON - The German Constitutional Court &apos;s recent decision to refer the complaint against the European Central Bank &apos;s so-called &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; to the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) leaves the scheme &apos;s fate uncertain . 
What is clear is that the economics behind OMT is flawed - and so is the politics . 
The OMT program arose in August 2012 , when months of relentlessly rising risk premiums on Spanish and Italian sovereign bonds were threatening the eurozone &apos;s survival and endangering the world economy . 
To restore confidence and buy time for governments to reduce borrowing , ECB President Mario Draghi pledged to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to preserve the eurozone - and that meant potentially unlimited purchases of distressed eurozone members &quot; government bonds . 
Draghi &apos;s declaration worked , prompting a sharp decline in risk premiums across the eurozone &apos;s troubled economies . 
But Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann , a member of the ECB &apos;s Governing Council , immediately challenged OMT , asserting that the program exceeded the ECB &apos;s mandate and violated Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty , which bars monetary financing of distressed sovereigns . 
Before OMT was ever activated , Weidmann took his case to the German Constitutional Court . 
OMT supporters were aghast at Weidmann &apos;s attempt to overturn the arrangement . 
After all , the mere announcement of the program had provided relief to struggling governments and may well have saved the monetary union , at least temporarily . 
Draghi audaciously described OMT as &quot; probably the most successful monetary-policy measure undertaken in recent time . &quot; 
But the German Constitutional Court remains dubious . 
While it has withheld a final judgment in deference to the ECJ , it has upheld the Bundesbank &apos;s view that OMT , in its current form , violates the Lisbon Treaty . 
OMT may still survive ; but , if it does , it will likely be diluted , allowing the problems that inspired it to reemerge . 
However problematic this might be for OMT &apos;s supporters , it should not have come as a surprise . 
The program was ill-conceived and sold by sleight of hand . 
The court was right to question the factual basis of the ECB &apos;s claim that the risk premiums reflected an unfounded market fear - a claim that was based on cherry-picked evidence . 
Indeed , the program &apos;s public defense rests shakily on a presumption of baseless speculative pressures . 
The program &apos;s design , however , conceded that the market &apos;s assessments of creditworthiness reflected a real default risk . 
As a lender of last resort to sovereigns , a central bank must stand ready to purchase sovereign debt unconditionally , in order to neutralize the effects of temporary market disruptions . 
But OMT is intended to operate more like the International Monetary Fund &apos;s lending - that is , to rescue a particular government conditional on its pursuit of fiscal belt-tightening . 
If the ECB were truly convinced that risk premiums were unreasonably high , and that distressed countries &quot; debt was sustainable , conditionality would have been unnecessary . 
Moreover , by tackling default risk , the OMT program created a new problem : private creditors , assured that the ECB would prevent governments from defaulting , were encouraged to lend with greater abandon . 
Reading the decline in risk premiums as a sign of renewed market confidence in distressed sovereigns &quot; creditworthiness was another self-serving misinterpretation . 
A similar situation has unfolded before . 
In the pre-euro era , propping up the Italian lira invited unrelenting speculative pressure . 
With the lira eliminated , holding down yields on sovereign debt can be a fool &apos;s errand . 
Just as untenably high exchange rates must ultimately depreciate , default is necessary in cases of unsustainable sovereign debt . 
This is all the more important in view of the ECB &apos;s disinclination to reverse near-deflationary conditions , which raise the effective debt-repayment burden further . 
Sovereign-debt attorneys Lee Buchheit and Mitu Gulati warn that markets could &quot; mercilessly test the ECB &apos;s willingness to persist in buying unlimited quantities of peripheral sovereign bonds . &quot; 
This test will be all the more severe if , as the ECB has conceded to the German Constitutional Court , the bond purchases would actually be limited . 
The eurozone must allow for selective default on sovereign debt , with the ECB acting as a lender of last resort for solvent governments . 
Of course , solvency can be difficult to assess during a crisis . 
But pretending that sovereigns are never insolvent serves only to compound the problem . 
As the German court pointed out , the prospect of default will help to maintain financial-market discipline . 
By attempting to create a quick fix for the eurozone &apos;s deep-rooted problems , the ECB has stepped into a political quagmire . 
Even if the ECJ gives OMT the benefit of the doubt , the program &apos;s legitimacy will remain plagued by qualms , leaving the ECB - if only behind the scenes - locked in political jockeying with distressed sovereigns . 
The line between audacity and hubris is a fine one . 
Rather than constituting a great success , OMT may well be remembered as an error born of expediency . 
Worse , it could undermine the ECB &apos;s hard-won independence and credibility . 
That is an outcome that the eurozone might not survive .
