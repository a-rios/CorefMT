Post-National Football ? 
NEW YORK - Some of the more hysterical German newspapers blamed Germany &apos;s defeat against Italy in the semi-finals of the European championship on the fact that few players bothered to sing the national anthem . 
Indeed , the captain , Gigi Buffon , sang with his eyes closed , as though in prayer . 
But the Italians had no chance in the final against Spain , the best team in the world , none of whose players opened their mouths during the Spanish anthem , Marcha Real - which stands to reason , given that the &quot; Royal March &quot; has no lyrics . 
And , besides , the Catalonian players feel uncomfortable with the national anthem , which was much promoted under the late dictator Francisco Franco , who hated Catalan nationalism . 
We know that in football , the most successful teams are not always those with the greatest stars . 
Champions operate as teams - cohesive , untroubled by the egotism of prima donnas , each player prepared to work for the others . 
Is patriotism really the key to this kind of spirit for national teams , as the German critics of their team believe ? 
Football has often been called a substitute for war - a symbolic , more or less peaceful , way to fight out international rivalries . 
The fans of national sides are actors in a kind of patriotic carnival , dressed in the costumes of their national stereotypes : English fans as medieval knights , the Dutch in clogs , the Spanish as bullfighters . 
Germans , understandably , have a problem with national symbolism , but I spotted a few fans in quasi-Bavarian dress . 
The prize for the most humorous masquerade must go to the Italians dressed as popes and cardinals . 
In the past , English fans - but they were not the only ones - took the war metaphor too far and acted more like invading armies on the continent of Europe , terrorizing towns unlucky enough to stage an England game . 
But players , too , sometimes have failed to conceal national animosities : when Holland beat Germany in a memorable European semi-final in 1988 , one of the Dutch players ostentatiously wiped his bottom with a German shirt . 
Given the strength of national feeling in these contests , it is not surprising that people like to project national characteristics onto the style of play . 
On the rare occasion that England wins a big match these days , victory is attributed to a &quot; typically &quot; English fighting spirit , coupled with &quot; fair play . &quot; 
The Germans play with &quot; discipline , &quot; the Italians with the defensive strength of Roman warriors , the Dutch with free-spirited individualism , the Spanish with the elegance of toreadors , and so on . 
When the French won the World Cup in 1998 , they ascribed it to their team &apos;s multi-ethnicity - the embodiment of France &apos;s commitment to liberté , égalité , fraternité . 
But , when teams lose , these stereotypical virtues are damned with equal conviction as characteristic defects : German lack of imagination , Italian fear of attack , Dutch selfishness , the absence of national feeling among ethnic minorities in France , and so on . 
In fact , the reality of football styles is rather more complicated . 
The provenance of the great Spanish game of today is not the bullring , but the Barcelona team built by Johan Cruyff in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s . 
The origin of his &quot; total football &quot; philosophy of keeping possession of the ball with quick , short passes and lightning switches from defense to offense was Ajax , Amsterdam , in the late 1960 &quot; s . 
As often happens with innovative models , others adopt them , and , as in the Spanish case , improve and refine them . 
Now everyone tries to play &quot; total football &quot; - except the English , who &quot; typically &quot; remain aloof from foreign ideas . 
Italians have abandoned their defensive tactics . 
Even the Germans play the passing game with flair and imagination . 
The difference between Spain and the others is that the Spaniards do it better . 
Daniel Cohn-Bendit , the Franco-German former student leader of 1968 and Green member of the European parliament , argued in a recent article that modern football stars don &apos;t really play for their countries . 
As hardened professionals , they primarily play for themselves . 
They are , to use his phrase , &quot; mercenaries . &quot; 
That is perhaps a little too cynical . 
The tears streaming down the cheeks of Andrea Pirlo and Mario Balotelli after Italy &apos;s defeat were not those of hardened pros . 
They wanted to win , not just for the money or for the sake of their careers , but for the glory . 
It still must feel good to be a national hero , hailed in the streets of Rome , Madrid , London , or Berlin as a returning warrior from a successful campaign . 
And yet Cohn-Bendit is not entirely wrong . 
What was striking during this European championship was the intimate collegiality between opposing players . 
They consoled and congratulated each other , embracing like the old friends and colleagues that they often are . 
Most of the top players play for the same clubs in Spain , Germany , England , or Italy . 
Many speak several European languages with the fluency of the international businessmen that they also are . 
The best European clubs are all multinational now . 
Players follow the money . 
Some of the most difficult and demanding prima donnas often cause less friction in these multinational outfits than they do on their national teams . 
If there is a moral to this story , it is this : a common flag , language , or national history can certainly help to induce people to work together in harmony for a shared cause . 
At the highest levels of human achievement - whether in art , science , or football - it might actually be the more important factor .
