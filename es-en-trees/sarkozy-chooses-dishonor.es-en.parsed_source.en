Sarkozy Chooses Dishonor 
PARIS - &quot; Britain and France had to choose between war and dishonor . 
They chose dishonor . 
Winston Churchill &apos;s famous denunciation of the delaying tactics of the British and French on the eve of World War II should be a warning to French President Nicolas Sarkozy . 
In fanning vicious anti-immigrant passions for short-term political gain , he will have dishonor first and then defeat . 
For , although a majority of French today may be inclined to sympathize with Sarkozy &apos;s immigrant-bashing rhetoric , there is no guarantee that they will re-elect him in 2012 . 
It is not so much Sarkozy &apos;s performance as president that most Frenchmen reject ; it is his essence . 
At a time of rising unemployment , with France dominated by fears about the future , the French need a reassuring father or mother figure , not a jittery and manipulative leaderready to compromise ethics and France &apos;s proud tradition that every citizen is entitled to equal treatment under the law . 
Former Prime Minister Michel Rocard did not mince words about Sarkozy &apos;s recent proposals to strip foreign-born French nationals of their citizenship if convicted of threatening the life of a police officer , practicing polygamy , or female &quot; circumcision . &quot; 
&quot; One has not seen such measures since the Vichy regime or since the Nazis , &quot; Rocard declared . 
Equating Sarkozy with Marshal Pétain &apos;s collaborationist Vichy regime is , of course , an exaggeration , but Rocard &apos;s concerns are shared by many French - and not only intellectuals and pundits . 
Even among traditional conservatives , there is a whiff of ethical disgust at Sarkozy . 
Can the French really violate their values to such an extent ? 
Will re-introduction of the death penalty be the next step on this populist downward spiral ? 
Two years , of course , is a long time in politics , and any predictions today about the presidential vote in 2012 would be imprudent . 
Yet few analysts today would bet on Sarkozy &apos;s re-election . 
He proved to be a great candidate in 2007 , but he was also running against a particularly weak Socialist contender , Ségolène Royal . 
In 2012 it is unlikely that a Socialist Party &quot; starved for power &quot; will commit electoral suicide once again by nominating an unelectable figure . 
Could France today be like the France of 1980 on the eve of the Left &apos;s first victory since the establishment of the Fifth Republic ? 
Will Dominique de Villepin , the flamboyant former prime minister under Jacques Chirac , be to Sarkozy what Chirac was to Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing in 1981 ? 
Chirac , it should be recalled , guaranteed the defeat of Giscard d &apos;Estaing by dividing the Right so bitterly that it proved impossible to reunite behind Giscard in his final-round confrontation with François Mitterrand . 
Behind such speculation are important questions about the state of French society and governmental institutions . 
France , perhaps more than most European countries , is faced with serious internal security problems and violence linked to the failures of previous immigration policies , which have turned the dreams of the 1960 &quot; s into the nightmares of the present . 
The undeniable escalation of violence in too many big-city suburbs , and the emergence of local &quot; Scarfaces &quot; who live totally without rules in a fantasy-like world of brutality , reflect a state that has gone astray . 
But a pure &quot; law and order &quot; response to these problems will not magically repair the damage inflicted by years of bad policy and neglect . 
Too much state is not the answer to a locally failed state . 
Successful education and integration policies take time to work and thus will not bring clear-cut results in time for the next election . 
To stigmatize immigrants , Muslims in particular , or to destroy the camps in which Roma live , is a much easier task , even if it reveals the truly opportunistic and amoral nature of both Sarkozy and those who surround him . 
For nearly 60 years , universal suffrage has made successive French presidents the modern equivalents of elected monarchs , men who have concentrated in their hands more power than their counterparts in any other democratic country . 
Chirac &apos;s shortening of the presidential term from seven to five years has , paradoxically , resulted in an even greater concentration of presidential power . 
The problem with this omnipotent presidency is that the qualities needed in order to be elected are not necessarily those required to master the art of government , with its mixture of distance , patience , serenity , and modesty , in addition to energy and activism . 
The French presidency combines both the symbols and the realities of power - the equivalent of both the Queen of England and the British prime minister . 
But an office designed bespoke for a giant like Charles de Gaulle may simply be too much for any single man or woman . 
Indeed , it could very well be that the failures of recent French presidents point to a structural problem at the heart of the French constitution , and not just to the shortcomings of its various incumbents .
