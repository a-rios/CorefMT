Central Asia &apos;s Waking Giant 
THE HAGUE - The Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) brings together almost half the world &apos;s population , several members own nuclear weapons , many are big energy suppliers , and it includes some of the world &apos;s fastest growing economies . 
Yet few outside Central Asia have heard much about it . 
The SCO emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union in 1996 . 
Today , its members are Russia , China , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan , while Mongolia , Iran , Pakistan and India are observers . 
Russia and China remain the lead actors . 
Since its launch , the SCO &apos;s military exercises have become increasingly ambitious , growing from largely bi-lateral to inclusion of all members . 
The SCO is also beginning to work together in the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime . 
Until recently , the SCO &apos;s members addressed energy issues only bilaterally . 
But , in order to coordinate energy strategies and strengthen energy security , last year the organization launched a club that unites energy-producing and energy-consuming states , transit countries , and private companies . 
The SCO promotes free trade , too , and aims to build essential infrastructure such as roads and railways to link its members and boost commerce between them while also harmonizing customs systems and tariffs . 
Yet cooperation within the SCO remains focused on national rather than collective objectives , because its members &quot; interests vary so much . 
China , for example , seeks markets for its products and further energy resources , while Russia aims to use the SCO to promote its anti-Western agenda . 
The group &apos;s other members - led by China and Kazakhstan - want to strengthen their already robust levels of economic cooperation with the West . 
Thus , for example , at the SCO summit in August , Russia did not get the support of other members regarding the Georgia conflict . 
These diverging objectives make it hard to believe that the SCO will ever evolve into an eastern version of NATO . 
True , its members have held joint military exercises and have expressed a desire to build the SCO into a more mature security organization . 
But the SCO still lacks many essential elements of a full-grown NATO-style security organization . 
The SCO has no integrated military-political structure , and no permanent operational headquarters . 
It has no rapid-reaction force and does not engage in regular political deliberations . 
NATO &apos;s focus is on external security risks , while the SCO &apos;s members target security issues within their own territories . 
It makes sense for the West , particularly the European Union , to seek cooperation with the SCO , as this would also help counter Russia &apos;s attempts to use it as a tool for its anti-Western policies . 
It would also prevent the SCO from turning into a militarized entity . 
These may look like negative reasons for the EU to engage with the SCO , but there are also ample positive reasons for encouraging cooperation . 
Europe needs energy supplies from Central Asia , and Central Asia needs European investment . 
Another sphere of mutual interest is Afghanistan . 
At present , the EU offers financial support to the Afghan government and helps to train its police and judiciary . 
The SCO has established a contact group with Afghanistan . 
Both sides want to do more , and they might be able to make a greater impact by working together rather than separately . 
The EU has money and the SCO organization , most of whose members border Afghanistan , has trained personnel and direct experience in the region . 
Cooperation with NATO also looks strategically wise . 
Given China &apos;s importance in both military and economic matters , growing energy and trade relations between Central Asia and the West , and the reasonable assumption that Central Asia &apos;s security will continue to have great significance for Western security , cooperation between the SCO , the EU , and NATO looks inevitable . 
This is all the more true in view of the common security threats faced by NATO and the SCO in Central Asia , such as Al-Qaeda and Taliban-sponsored terrorism and drug trafficking . 
But both NATO and the SCO have so far hesitated to engage in closer contact . 
It is hard to discern whether NATO has any opinion at all about the SCO . 
At best , NATO seems to regard it as being neither a problem nor an opportunity . 
Reaching out to the SCO would certainly seem to support NATO &apos;s stated objectives . 
After 9 / 11 , the alliance came to the conclusion that threats may need to be dealt with on a worldwide basis , which explains NATO &apos;s presence in Afghanistan . 
As a part of this global strategy , NATO strengthened its relations with partners elsewhere , including in Southeast Asia which is the SCO &apos;s chief area of responsibility . 
Perhaps inevitably , the SCO - and Russia and China as its leading members - regards NATO &apos;s increased presence in the region with some mistrust . 
As long as NATO remains reluctant to enter into a dialogue with the SCO , such a cautious attitude looks set to linger , and may even intensify . 
Consideration also needs to be given , therefore , to the establishment of a NATO-China Council , along the lines of the NATO-Russia Council , and to the creation of arrangements that would facilitate greater cooperation with the SCO as a whole . 
Such cooperation would not bridge the main differences between SCO members and the West over issues like democratization and human rights . 
Cooperation would also need to comprise much more than mere joint policy development , and should involve the practical pursuit of mutually beneficial , smaller-scale ad hoc projects . 
NATO and the SCO could work together on neutralizing anti-personnel mines in Afghanistan , as well as other possible types of confidence-building measures , such as joint police training and counter-narcotics operations . 
If security cooperation is to be a success , politically sensitive issues should be avoided , with the emphasis squarely on practical measures . 
This approach would serve the interests of the EU , NATO , the SCO &apos;s members , and , not least , Afghanistan .
