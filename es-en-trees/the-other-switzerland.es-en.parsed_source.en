The Other Switzerland 
BRUSSELS - As policymakers scratch their heads and wonder how best to absorb different cultures and religions into Europe &apos;s very distinct national societies , they could do worse than consider some new ideas being developed in Switzerland . 
Switzerland , the country that recently voted to ban the construction of minarets on mosques ? 
Absolutely . 
It is time for Europe to adjust the way that it thinks about nationality , cultural roots , and how it deals with immigrants . 
In a world of increasing mobility , an aging Europe will badly need the immigrants of whom it is so frightened - and it should give them a voice in local politics soon ( say , one year ) after they arrive . 
After all , it is more important for taxpayers to participate in local politics than to sit on the sidelines waiting to be given the rights of native citizens . 
Democratic participation is the best way to integrate people into society and make them feel that their opinions count , regardless of whether they have formal citizenship and thus the right to vote . 
I should declare a personal interest here : I was stateless for a time after my birth in Geneva . 
My father was American , but naturalized too recently to hand his US citizenship on to me . 
I was born on Swiss soil , but that did not give me the right to a Swiss passport . 
In the end , the Irish accepted me because that was my mother &apos;s nationality . 
I have a framed copy of the Act of Parliament by Dail Eireann that was needed . 
I have lived in Europe all my life , mostly in Belgium , but never in Ireland , and I have never voted , despite the fact that the Maastricht treaty entitles me to vote both in European elections and in Belgium &apos;s local elections . 
I suppose that I belong to an expat generation that has not been educated to consider voting an essential right , if not a duty , and I regret that . 
Foreign voter participation is clearly bound to work best at a local level , where the issues are more concrete . 
That is where Switzerland demonstrates that giving foreigners a voice is good policy , one that also means teaching citizens to understand the benefits of open democracy . 
The canton of Neuchatel ( one of the 26 mini-states that comprise the Swiss confederation ) lies alongside the French border . 
Its official language is French , it has its own constitution , and it has created a highly efficient Multicultural Cohesion Service . 
The Council of Europe , which for 60 years has promoted European integration through human rights and culture , includes Neuchatel among 10 &quot; intercultural &quot; cities that it is studying for &quot; best practice &quot; policies and governance in multicultural societies . 
In the case of Neuchatel , this includes the canton as well as the picturesque lakeside city . 
Unemployment is relatively low , despite hard times for its major industry - watch-making - and foreigners represent one-quarter of its 170,000 residents . 
Much of Neuchatel &apos;s progressive attitude toward foreign residents is attributable to one man , Thomas Facchinetti , who started a multicultural cohesion service 20 years ago and has steadily built it up . 
Among his achievements is a Citizens &quot; Charter that is handed to every new resident to explain Swiss participatory democracy and lay out its rules . 
His offices also have an anti-racism service , offer well publicized access to inexpensive French classes , and distribute booklets on topics like forced marriages and headscarves . 
The fact that Facchinetti himself is the lynchpin of the canton &apos;s open-minded views may be seen as a weakness , but it is also its strength . 
Tolerance has a face - the neat smiling figure of this son of Italian immigrants , who is easily accessible to the canton &apos;s citizens . 
Partly as a result of his efforts , Neuchatel was one of the four cantons in Switzerland to vote against the ban on new minarets . 
If people are to feel committed to the place where they live , they must be allowed to influence decision-making , and that influence should not depend on nationality . 
In Neuchatel , many naturalized citizens , including elected local councilors , retain their foreign passports for several reasons : among European Union passport-holders , doing so allows their children to study in the EU or to work there themselves . 
Among non-EU citizens , it allows them to re-settle in their parents &quot; or grandparents &quot; country if they so desire . 
No two countries , regions , or cities are the same . 
Geography , budgets , political systems , and the number and nature of its immigrants differ .
