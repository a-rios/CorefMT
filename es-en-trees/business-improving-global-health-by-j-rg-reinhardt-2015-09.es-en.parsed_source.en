The Business of Improving Global Health 
ZURICH - The dramatic success of the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) in driving advances in human health will be a hard act to follow . 
In just 15 years , child mortality was nearly halved , and malaria deaths declined by 60 % . 
Today nearly 15 million people worldwide receive treatment for AIDS , helping them continue to be productive members of society , compared to only about 10,000 people in 2000 , when the MDGs were launched . 
Can the new Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , just adopted by the United Nations to guide global development efforts for the next 15 years , replicate the MDGs &quot; success ? 
But the new health-related goals are broader and more ambitious than before . 
And the public-health situation is in many ways more challenging than in 2000 . 
The new SDGs set a lofty goal : for the first time , world leaders have vowed to reduce premature deaths caused by chronic illnesses such as cancer , heart disease , and diabetes . 
This is a tall order at a time of rapid population growth and rapid aging . 
Chronic diseases are the main - and growing - cause of death in developed and developing countries alike . 
And more than two billion people still lack access to essential medicines . 
To achieve the new targets , we must find creative new ways to address the world &apos;s biggest health challenges . 
Above all , we must develop new business models that allow society to better harness the know-how , creativity , and drive of private enterprises to help improve public health . 
Companies share the responsibility for meeting these new goals , but they also need support from governments and other organizations to ensure the greatest positive impact . 
A billion people joined the human race in just the last 12 years . 
Another billion or so will join by 2030 , bringing the world &apos;s population to 8.5 billion , according to UN estimates . 
The fastest-growing segment of the population is people over 60 , a group that is expected to grow by 500 million people , to 1.4 billion , in 2030 . 
Older people are more likely to develop chronic illnesses , which now account for 63 % of all deaths worldwide . 
The World Health Organization predicts that the proportion will reach 70 % in the next ten years , with most of the deaths occurring in developing countries . 
Some 28 million people die from chronic diseases in low- and middle-income countries each year , accounting for roughly three-quarters of all deaths caused by chronic disease globally . 
Developing countries &quot; health systems are already stretched . 
They often lack medicines , resources , and know-how to treat chronically ill patients , who may require years or decades of treatment . 
For example , there are only four oncologists in Ethiopia , a country of some 97 million people . 
Moreover , many developing countries face a double disease burden and must wage a simultaneous battle against infectious diseases such as malaria , tuberculosis , and HIV / AIDS . 
Clearly , more resources will be needed to tackle these challenges . 
But in the wake of the global financial crisis , development assistance for health from governments and private donors has plateaued at about $ 35 billion annually , after growing more than 11 % per year from 2000-2010 . 
And less than 2 % of that money was directed at combatting chronic diseases . 
The long-term nature of chronic diseases , and the complexity of providing better treatment for patients in the developing world , calls for innovative solutions . 
Companies possess the capabilities and the global scale to play a stronger future role in addressing public-health challenges and achieving the objectives of the SDGs . 
Some corporations are beginning to explore new &quot; social business &quot; approaches that will allow them to meet the needs of people and society in the developing world , while at the same time covering their costs , or even making a small profit . 
Moneymaking social ventures are self-sustaining and have the potential to grow , bringing benefits to more and more people . 
They are a potentially powerful complement to philanthropy , which has underpinned much recent progress in public health . 
My company , for example , is launching a portfolio of 15 essential medicines to treat diseases including diabetes , respiratory illnesses , and breast cancer . 
The aim is to make these medicines available to people of modest means in developing countries at a cost to local health systems of $ 1 per treatment per month . 
We will start in Kenya , Vietnam , and Ethiopia . 
It is a small first step , and we will learn as we go , with a goal of expanding to 30 countries in a few years . 
To overcome the many hurdles to success in low- and middle-income countries , these new types of business ventures will likely need to explore innovative forms of collaboration with governments , non-governmental organizations , and other companies . 
Such collaboration has already shown that working across traditional boundaries , making creative use of technology , and developing pragmatic solutions can yield impressive results . 
Bringing health care to everyone on the planet is a great challenge . It will take imagination , cooperation , and hard work .
