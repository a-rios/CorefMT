The Sarkozy Option 
PARIS - From the Caucasus in August 2008 to the Middle East in January 2009 , is France under President Nicolas Sarkozy attempting to incarnate what might be called &quot; the West by default , &quot; making maximum use of the window of opportunity opened by America &apos;s presidential transition ? 
Or is Sarkozy simply trying to capitalize on his global visibility to reinforce his popularity at home , where a majority of French citizens continue to support their hyperactive president &apos;s diplomatic leadership ? 
Despite his failed bid to orchestrate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas , was he not right to try ? 
For the French , Sarkozy &apos;s determination to act , despite the odds , seems far superior to the passive cynicism of those who preach abstention or satisfy themselves with empty words . 
Beyond its impact on the Middle East , Sarkozy &apos;s failed but brave attempt to act as a go-between constitutes an interesting window into the foreign-policy methods and ambitions of today &apos;s France . 
For the essential question about Sarko-diplomacy is whether it reflects a well-defined strategy , based on a clear vision of the world , or merely expresses a shrewd and pragmatic activism that applies a keen domestic political instinct to the field of foreign affairs ? 
The answer is far from clear , and is probably a combination of both . 
Sarkozy is a man prone to following his instincts . 
He does not theorize about what should be done ; he simply does it , without any ideological bias or constraint . 
Yet , as time passes , one senses the emergence of something like a new French self-definition , which is probably the most clearly &quot; Western &quot; in the history of the Fifth Republic . 
As a presidential candidate , Sarkozy was often described as &quot; Sarkozy the American , &quot; an expression that alluded to his can-do style , his taste for &quot; bling , &quot; and the very American way in which he used his personal history to gain the support of would-be voters . 
But now one could describe him as &quot; Sarkozy the Westerner . &quot; 
This is not only because he has been willing to have France act , from the Caucasus to the Middle East , in the name of Europe and itself at a time America was defaulting on its role . 
Nor is it simply the result of Sarkozy &apos;s decision to bring France closer to the United States , a move that will culminate symbolically with France &apos;s likely return to the integrated military body of NATO in April 2009 . 
In a deeper way , Sarkozy &apos;s diplomacy reflects changes in how the French President thinks about the idea of &quot; the West &quot; in today &apos;s globalized world . 
Under Charles de Gaulle , France combined faithfulness to the Western cause in time of crisis with a strong willingness to promote its diplomatic independence and freedom of maneuver . 
And , despite their very different styles , both Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing and François Mitterrand were more &quot; European &quot; than &quot; Western . &quot; 
The same cannot be said of Sarkozy , despite his claims to the contrary . 
His rapprochement with Great Britain and his noticeable distancing of France from Germany are , from this perspective , no accident . 
In a world where , in comparative terms , there is less America because of the rise of China and India and the resurgence of Russia , and less Europe in diplomatic and strategic terms ( due to institutional paralysis ) , if not economic and cultural terms , France , according to Sarkozy , must clearly define itself as part of the West . 
And , just as the very notion of the West must now be analyzed and probably redefined for the twenty-first century , so France must play a central part in this act of reassessment . 
Is the West a concept defined above all by its political culture , i.e. , democracy and human rights , by its cultural dimension , including religion , or merely by its diplomatic and strategic implications , i.e. , facing the rise of new powers ? 
If the concept of the West is to become the new cornerstone of France &apos;s diplomatic identity , it must be applied with prudence and moderation , even as Barack Obama &apos;s arrival in the White House is likely to improve its image of the premiere Western power . 
France is not in the same league in terms of power and influence as the US . 
Moreover , it would be paradoxical if , just when America declares its willingness to call more upon its allies , particularly its European allies , the concept of the West actually leads to the diminution , if not the burial , of the European ideal .
