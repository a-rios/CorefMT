The Return of the Dollar 
LAGUNA BEACH - The US dollar is on the move . 
In the last four months alone , it has soared by more than 7 % compared with a basket of more than a dozen global currencies , and by even more against the euro and the Japanese yen . 
This dollar rally , the result of genuine economic progress and divergent policy developments , could contribute to the &quot; rebalancing &quot; that has long eluded the world economy . 
But that outcome is far from guaranteed , especially given the related risks of financial instability . 
Two major factors are currently working in the dollar &apos;s favor , particularly compared to the euro and the yen . 
First , the United States is consistently outperforming Europe and Japan in terms of economic growth and dynamism - and will likely continue to do so - owing not only to its economic flexibility and entrepreneurial energy , but also to its more decisive policy action since the start of the global financial crisis . 
Second , after a period of alignment , the monetary policies of these three large and systemically important economies are diverging , taking the world economy from a multi-speed trajectory to a multi-track one . 
Indeed , whereas the US Federal Reserve terminated its large-scale securities purchases , known as &quot; quantitative easing &quot; ( QE ) , last month , the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank recently announced the expansion of their monetary-stimulus programs . 
In fact , ECB President Mario Draghi signaled a willingness to expand his institution &apos;s balance sheet by a massive â‚¬ 1 trillion ( $ 1.25 trillion ) . 
With higher US market interest rates attracting additional capital inflows and pushing the dollar even higher , the currency &apos;s revaluation would appear to be just what the doctor ordered when it comes to catalyzing a long-awaited global rebalancing - one that promotes stronger growth and mitigates deflation risk in Europe and Japan . 
Specifically , an appreciating dollar improves the price competitiveness of European and Japanese companies in the US and other markets , while moderating some of the structural deflationary pressure in the lagging economies by causing import prices to rise . 
Yet the benefits of the dollar &apos;s rally are far from guaranteed , for both economic and financial reasons . 
While the US economy is more resilient and agile than its developed counterparts , it is not yet robust enough to be able to adjust smoothly to a significant shift in external demand to other countries . 
There is also the risk that , given the role of the ECB and the Bank of Japan in shaping their currencies &quot; performance , such a shift could be characterized as a &quot; currency war &quot; in the US Congress , prompting a retaliatory policy response . 
Furthermore , sudden large currency moves tend to translate into financial-market instability . 
To be sure , this risk was more acute when a larger number of emerging-economy currencies were pegged to the US dollar , which meant that a significant shift in the dollar &apos;s value would weaken other countries &quot; balance-of-payments position and erode their international reserves , thereby undermining their creditworthiness . 
Today , many of these countries have adopted more flexible exchange-rate regimes , and quite a few retain adequate reserve holdings . 
But a new issue risks bringing about a similarly problematic outcome : By repeatedly repressing financial-market volatility over the last few years , central-bank policies have inadvertently encouraged excessive risk-taking , which has pushed many financial-asset prices higher than economic fundamentals warrant . 
To the extent that continued currency-market volatility spills over into other markets - and it will - the imperative for stronger economic fundamentals to validate asset prices will intensify . 
This is not to say that the currency re-alignment that is currently underway is necessarily a problematic development ; on the contrary , it has the potential to boost the global economy by supporting the recovery of some of its most challenged components . 
But the only way to take advantage of the re-alignment &apos;s benefits , without experiencing serious economic disruptions and financial-market volatility , is to introduce complementary growth-enhancing policy adjustments , such as accelerating structural reforms , balancing aggregate demand , and reducing or eliminating debt overhangs . 
After all , global growth , at its current level , is inadequate for mere redistribution among countries to work . 
Overall global GDP needs to increase . 
The US dollar &apos;s resurgence , while promising , is only a first step . 
It is up to governments to ensure that the ongoing currency re-alignment supports a balanced , stable , and sustainable economic recovery . 
Otherwise , they may find themselves again in the unpleasant business of mitigating financial instability .
