A Europe for All 
Longtime members of the European Union now seem to doubt the Union &apos;s future , but we in Ukraine look at the European Union with hope and admiration . 
To join in the EU &apos;s progress is the basic object of our foreign policy , for Ukraine has discovered that nationhood is not an end , but a beginning . 
Indeed , European unity is indivisible : when one nation is ostracized , all are not free . 
We Europeans are caught in an inescapable net , tied in a single garment of destiny . 
Every aspect of our shared culture , if not the last century of shared suffering , confirms that for us . 
Whatever affects one European directly , affects all indirectly . 
Never again can we afford to live with the narrow notion of two Europes , of haves and have-nots , of insiders and outsiders . 
Anyone who lives within the European continent cannot - indeed , must not - be considered a stranger to its Union . 
Today &apos;s great Pax Europa and today &apos;s pan-European prosperity depend on this . 
Of course , some people mutter that Ukraine is not Europe . 
Let them come to Kyiv and speak to the people , young and old , factory worker , farmer &apos;s wife , the lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks on end last winter to defend their freedoms . 
Are they not united with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French Resistance ? 
Are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the 1930 &quot; s , who liberated Budapest in 1956 and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970 &quot; s ? 
Are they not animated by the same spirit as Poland &apos;s Solidarity and the peaceful masses that created Prague &apos;s Velvet Revolution in 1989 ? 
That is the true European spirit , and no doubts can crush it . 
To those who say that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership , I say : Let them , too , come to my country and see the mothers who stay late at night at work teaching their children to use their workplace computer . 
Let them come to the language classes in every village and city where young people are readying themselves for Europe by learning French and German and English . 
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe &apos;s past is proud , and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten borderland on a troubled region , but as a maker and shaper of Europe &apos;s peace and Europe &apos;s unity . 
Self-determination no longer means isolation , because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status . 
New nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France established with Germany - a relationship founded on equality and mutual interests . 
That is the type of relationship that my government seeks with Russia , and achieving it is how we can help extend the zone of Europe &apos;s peace . 
Of course , it is premature to do more than indicate the high regard with which we view the prospect of EU membership . 
We know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight . 
We know that the great works of European unification lay not in documents and declarations , but in innovative action designed to better the lives and insure the security of all Europeans . 
Building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy , cheap , or fast . 
But , like the Union itself , it will be built and it will be done . 
We know the challenge is great , but the prize is worth the struggle , and Europe should know that this is our goal . 
Part of the work of renewing Ukraine is a creative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism - ideologies born in the heart of Europe - battled for mastery . 
Only a few months ago , in cities throughout Ukraine , our children and our parents confronted armed troops , snarling dogs , and even death . 
Only a few years ago , a young journalist , Georgi Gongadze , seeking to inform the public about our old regime &apos;s corruption , was brutalized and beheaded by that regime &apos;s thugs . 
But our Orange Revolution last winter shows that Ukraine &apos;s people prevailed . 
So , despite today &apos;s doubts and difficulties , I retain an abiding faith in Europe . 
I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of Ukraine &apos;s history . 
I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of communism &apos;s legacy that we can never see the bright daybreak of peace and true European unity . 
When the EU &apos;s citizens ponder Ukraine &apos;s place in Europe , they should look both beyond and more closely at the face they see . 
They should look beyond the ravaged wastelands that communism inflicted , beyond the poverty , and beyond the social divisions through which our discarded ex-leaders sought to prolong their misrule . 
Instead , they should look closely at the face of our president , Viktor Yushchenko , ravaged by poison during last year &apos;s election campaign , and recall the words of the great Frenchman Andr√© Malraux , for whom &quot; the most beautiful faces are those that have been wounded . &quot;
