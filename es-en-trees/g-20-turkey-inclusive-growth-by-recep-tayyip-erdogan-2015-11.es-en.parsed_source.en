Inclusive Growth and Global Justice 
ANKARA - As France and the world mourn the terrorist slaughter of innocents in Paris , the leaders of the G-20 are meeting in Antalya , Turkey . 
Terror will now vault to the top of the long list of pressing issues that will be discussed . 
The G-20 , whose members account for about 85 % of the world economy , has an important responsibility to respond to challenges that affect the lives and prosperity of millions of people around the world . 
It cannot risk falling into complacency and inaction , whether regarding terrorism or the fragile state of the world &apos;s economy . 
Since Turkey assumed the presidency of the G-20 in December 2014 , our approach toward ensuring inclusive and robust growth through collective action has enjoyed the support of the organization &apos;s members . 
This effort has been built on three pillars : decisive implementation of past commitments , boosting investments as a powerful driver of the global economy , and promotion of inclusiveness so that the benefits of growth are shared by all . 
When it comes to implementation , great strides have been made . 
By promoting sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies and implementing solid , structural reforms , we have made significant progress toward our objective of expanding the G-20 &quot; s collective GDP by 2.1 % by 2018 . 
The global financial system is now more resilient than it has ever been . 
Financial capacities are being rebuilt , and new growth targets are being met . 
But there remains much more to be done . 
G-20 members should expedite efforts to deliver on their commitments to boost productivity and eliminate structural bottlenecks to investment , competition , trade , and jobs . 
We must also cement the fundamental reforms to the global financial system that the G-20 has delivered over the past seven years . 
Our focus on investment - a key driver of growth , jobs , and development - is also beginning to pay off . 
There is a huge investment gap in the global economy , both in advanced and developing countries . 
That is why we need developed-country strategies that bring together concrete policy actions and commitments to improve the investment ecosystem , support small and-medium-size enterprises , and promote the construction of efficient , high-quality infrastructure . 
If the G-20 members fully implement their commitments under these strategies , their collective GDP is expected to increase by another 1 % . 
Economic growth must be strong and sustainable ; but , above all , it must be inclusive . 
Inequality is rising in many G-20 countries ; in some cases , it has reached historic highs . 
This is a dangerous development , one that can retard growth , threaten the cohesion of societies , and jeopardize people &apos;s wellbeing . 
It is imperative that the G-20 tackle inequality head on and demonstrate its determination to ensure that all of its member countries &quot; citizens enjoy the fruits of economic growth . 
Reducing unemployment is central to the fight against inequality . 
There are about 100 million jobless people in the G-20 , and another 200 million young people who are neither working nor studying . 
Significantly reducing youth unemployment is one of the G-20 &quot; s most important commitments . 
Inclusiveness cannot stop at the borders of the G-20 . 
We must work to ensure that the benefits of growth and prosperity are shared by people all over the world . 
In Antalya , we will discuss how we can align our efforts with the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and increase our engagement with low-income , developing countries . 
As politics and economics are increasingly intertwined , the G-20 must also work together to confront our era &apos;s geopolitical challenges . 
This year is an important one in the fight against climate change . 
We must send a strong political message from Antalya in support of a successful outcome at the United Nations Climate Change Conference that takes place in Paris from November 30 to December 11 . 
Meanwhile , the terror attacks in Paris have brutally reminded us , once again , that global challenges - such as terrorism , the war in Syria , and the refugee crisis - require truly global responses . 
The G-20 is an ideal forum in which to address them . 
The Syrian civil war - now well into its fourth year - must be brought to an end , and a fair and sustainable political transition must be ensured . 
The conflict and the brutal state terrorism of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime is not only the cause of terrible suffering in Syria and the death of more than 360,000 people ; it is also the root of the refugee crisis and the emergence of Daesh - a threat to all countries . 
Turkey is a member of the coalition against Daesh , and we are seeking to degrade and destroy this terrorist menace in our country and beyond our borders . 
At the same time , we must not allow ourselves to forget the plight of those fleeing the brutality of the Assad regime and Daesh . 
The international community that shuddered at the photograph of Alan Kurdi , the three-year-old Syrian toddler who was found dead on a Turkish beach , must be made to remember that many more like him are dying every day in the cold waters of the Mediterranean and the Aegean . 
Turkey is currently hosting some 2.2 million Syrian refugees , and we have spent more than $ 8 billion over the last three years caring for them . 
The international community must agree on a mechanism that ensures that the burden is fairly shared . 
Finally , it is important to note that Turkey continues to confront the threat of the Kurdistan Workers &quot; Party ( PKK ) , an organization listed as a terrorist group by both the United States and the European Union . 
Turkey has implemented a large number of reforms and made major investments to the benefit of our Kurdish citizens . 
And yet the PKK has refused to disarm , instead amassing weapons and attacking civilian and security targets across the country . 
As we continue to fight the scourge of terrorism in our country , we call on all countries not only to mourn the dead in Paris , but to reject terrorism in all of its forms . 
The G-20 Summit in Antalya will address these and other major issues confronting the world . 
Whether the subject is economics , finance , climate change , or politics , the guiding principle must be equality and justice for all .
