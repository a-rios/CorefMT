Palestine &apos;s House Divided 
President George W. Bush &apos;s call for a new peace conference for Israel , Palestine , and neighboring states that back a two-state solution is a welcome , if very tardy , development . 
The Hamas / Fatah face-off marks a dramatic shift in Palestinian politics , whose top priorities until now has been an end to the Israeli occupation and the establishment of an independent state . 
It also tremendously complicates peace negotiations , which both the Palestinians and the &quot; Quartet &quot; ( the United States , the European Union , the United Nations , and Russia ) had premised on maintaining the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as a single territorial unit . 
Ironically , these territories were reunited by Israel &apos;s victory in the 1967 war , after 19 years of separation . 
Previously , Egypt had ruled in Gaza , while Jordan annexed the West Bank . 
Under Israel &apos;s occupation , and then with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) in 1994 , the territories remained separated geographically , but not politically . 
The Hamas takeover in Gaza has - at least for now - ended that political unification . 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has now set his conditions for dialogue . 
Hamas must withdraw its armed men from all security headquarters they occupied , return power to the legitimate authority , and apologize to the Palestinian people . 
Although internal division harms Palestinians &quot; national interest , it is unlikely amid mutual accusations and incitements that dialogue between Fatah and Hamas will be conducted soon . 
But the fear that is most consuming Abbas and Fatah is that the conflict with Hamas might spread to the West Bank . 
To avoid such a scenario , Abbas has banned all militias and military groups in the West Bank , including his Fatah Party &apos;s al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades . 
Abbas has succeeded in convincing Israel to grant amnesty to many Fatah fugitives in the West Bank who will join his security apparatuses . 
Abbas has also asked Israel to allow the PLO &apos;s Badr Brigade , currently stationed in Jordan , to enter the West Bank . 
That would give Abbas an additional 3,000 well-equipped and trained troops . 
Following King Abdullah II of Jordan &apos;s intervention , Israel appears to have agreed to allow the Badr Brigade &apos;s entry with full arms and ammunition . 
If Fatah is to become a viable partner for peace and regain its grassroots support , it must reform itself and end the widespread corruption that has undermined its reputation . 
Abbas must also share power with more disciplined , younger leaders . 
Israel can help Abbas by releasing senior Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti , who is currently serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison . 
Owing to his influence with the Fatah militias , Barghouti &apos;s release could help Abbas and the discredited Fatah leadership , and boost the younger generation of Fatah leaders . 
Israel is divided on how to deal with Hamas , which will also complicate the start of peace talks . 
Some Israelis argue that Hamas should be encouraged to establish order in Gaza and provide assurances to its neighbors . 
If Hamas can establish order inside Gaza , prevent violence against Israel , and stop missile attacks against Israeli towns and villages , it might avoid Israeli military intervention . 
But the dominant view in Israel is that Hamas is a direct threat , unwilling to stop attacks on Israel . 
For Israel , last summer &apos;s fight with Hezbollah in Lebanon demonstrated the risks of allowing radical Islamists to consolidate their power on Israel &apos;s border . 
Sooner or later , Israel is likely to deal with Hamas militarily , perhaps even by re-occupying Gaza . 
One reason neighboring countries may take part in peace talks is that Egypt and Jordan fear that Hamas could begin actively to support these countries &quot; own Islamic opposition groups . 
Moreover , Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia - the three main Sunni Muslim regimes - are concerned that Gaza could provide a base for their regional non-Arab foe , Shiite Iran . 
Their fear is based on Iranian support for Islamist groups - Sunni and Shiite - in Iraq , Lebanon , and Palestine , as well as its ongoing relationship with Syria . 
If the Hamas-Fatah split brings about another territorial partition , Palestinians &quot; national aspirations will suffer their gravest setback in the last half-century . 
Although the overwhelming majority of Palestinians reject the use of force to settle this power struggle , many welcome the change in Gaza , where Hamas has cleared the streets of armed militias and restored some law and order . 
The Palestinians confront a harsh reality . 
Whatever actions are taken to confront Hamas will undermine the Palestinian national project . 
A house divided against itself cannot stand , said Abraham Lincoln .
