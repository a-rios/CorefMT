Europe &apos;s Roadblocks to Long-Term Investment 
AMSTERDAM - One of the major challenges facing the European economy is the lack of liquidity in its capital markets . 
Since the 2008 global financial crisis , an enormous number of new rules have been put in place . 
In order to facilitate the long-term investment that Europe desperately needs , it would be wise to reassess the broader regulatory environment that has emerged over the past six years . 
With banks reluctant to make new loans , institutions such as pension funds are well placed to meet the desperate demand for capital . 
Indeed , the savings of workers who may not be retiring for several decades are particularly well suited for long-term investments . 
The trouble is that in many cases , rules and regulations intended to ensure financial markets &quot; stability impede the ability of pension funds and others to allocate savings smoothly and efficiently . 
The importance of proper regulations cannot be understated . 
When properly drafted and applied , they ensure financial stability , maintain ( and , if necessary , restore ) confidence in the markets , and facilitate long-term investment , helping citizens meet their future financial needs . 
The new margin requirements for derivatives , introduced in order to reduce systemic risk , are one example of such a chokepoint . 
It might make sense to apply them to banks or hedge funds , but pension funds are highly creditworthy institutions that pose little or no systemic risk to financial markets . 
Forcing them to set aside assets for collateral purposes only drains capital that could be used for long-term-investment . 
Such investment involves a variety of products , market players , and jurisdictions , and , as a result , the effect of regulations can be difficult to see , much less quantify . 
For starters , the impact of rules and regulations can be direct or indirect . 
Rules that apply specifically to long-term-investment products or strategies can be classified as having a direct impact . 
Rules that apply to investors or their counterparts , competitive products , or complementary parts of the market can be described as having an indirect effect . 
A well-crafted regulatory framework minimizes the adverse consequences for long-term investment , while maximizing the positive effects . 
New regulations are constantly being introduced . 
It is important to analyze carefully whether the new regulations are actually needed and , if yes , to foresee and fill regulatory gaps with rules that ensure the smooth flow of savings to new and existing projects . 
For example , standardizing regulations relating to covered bonds , green bonds , and cross-border investment through real-estate trusts could encourage more long-term investment . 
In a more indirect way , a general regulatory push that increased the availability of projects suitable for long-term-investment and harmonized local insolvency regimes could also have a positive effect . 
Prominent examples of regulations with a direct negative impact include existing rules on securitization and proposed rules on asset-based capital charges . 
The indirect negative effects of such regulations on long-term investment are , by nature , more difficult to discern , but they can be just as harmful as the direct effects - especially if they leave investors with fewer funds available for long-term investment . 
Margin requirements for derivatives transactions have this effect , as do regulations that increase banking costs . 
These types of indirect negative effects have not been central to policy discussions concerning how to boost long-term investment . 
It is crucial that we identify the full scope and scale of their impact on the allocation of capital . 
Otherwise , they risk offsetting the positive impact of investment-enhancing reforms . 
As legislators and regulators continue to shape the investment environment , it is important not only to monitor and evaluate the impact of each piece of additional regulation ; the way rules interact with one another - and with new rules as they are introduced - must also be understood . 
Unnecessarily broad regulations should be avoided in favor of rules that are specifically tailored to the various participants in the market . 
Allowing long-term investors such as pension funds to provide the European economy with much-needed capital has the potential to provide huge benefits to future retirees , as well as to the broader economy .
