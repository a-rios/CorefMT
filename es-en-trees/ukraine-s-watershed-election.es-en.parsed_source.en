Ukraine &apos;s Watershed Election 
Ukraine &apos;s politics are not those of the steppe . 
Our voters cannot stroll in one direction during one poll , and in the opposite direction the next time they vote , without worrying about falling over the edge . 
Ukrainians are people of the watershed : we live on either one side or the other of a great divide . 
A year ago , Ukrainians dared to risk the unfamiliar territory over the hill , and found democracy and the promise of a more open and honest economy . 
The alternatives - for my country , for Russia , and for Europe - are clear . 
Of the three leading electoral coalitions that are challenging each other , the forces that supported the Orange Revolution seek a modern and democratic future for our country . 
The other bloc offers the near-certainty of a return to a surly and squalid isolation ­  -  perhaps the beginning of the end of our hard-won independence . 
Of course , our Orange forces are not perfect , and Viktor Yanukovych - who again opposes Ukraine &apos;s democrats - is not Stalin reincarnated . 
Yanukovych &apos;s &quot; Party of the Regions &quot; has been leading in opinion polls for months , and the world should remember that Yushchenko &apos;s ultimate triumph over him in 2004 was by a whisker , not a landslide . 
Moreover , Yushchenko used his year in power mostly to disappoint those whose votes he now needs . 
The case against a Yanukovych counter-revolution is that it would be just that : a ruthless effort to undo Ukraine &apos;s democratic and legal reforms . 
Moreover , he would not be left to himself to govern , but would be a marionette of the oligarchs who bankroll his party , and perhaps of Russia , which yearns ­ - albeit more discretely than a year ago - for his triumph . 
Yanukovych &apos;s party contains the largest core of unreconstructed apparatchiks of any party . 
Many of its candidates seek office not to work for Ukraine &apos;s betterment , but to gain parliamentary immunity from prosecution . 
Some say we should not worry , that democracy and the market are now too well established in Ukraine to be replaced ; that reform is irreversible ; and that the country &apos;s ruling oligarchic clans , like those of Eastern Europe , will in time become law-abiding capitalists . 
Alas , this view is based more on wishful-thinking than on reality . 
A year after the Orange Revolution demonstrated ordinary Ukrainians &quot; fidelity to liberty , Yanukovych still evinces no faith in democracy , and the &quot; single economic space &quot; with Russia that he backs will strengthen the abusive oligarchic system and rule out liberalization . 
Yanukovych &apos;s foreign policy might not be openly subservient to Russia , but it won &apos;t also be a clearly pro-western one either . 
A Yanukovych government promises the semi-neutrality of semi-paralysis . 
Many who support Yanukovych do not necessarily wish to go back to the old days but are confused by the buffeting they have received in the past decade . 
Yanukovych panders to xenophobes and anti-Semites , and his strongest appeal is to the core of angry diehards who detest the collapse of Soviet power . 
He remains unrepentant about the obscene levels of corruption during his tenure as prime minister . 
I do not claim that the Orange Revolution &apos;s protagonists are paragons , and that the split between Yushchenko and me has not disheartened many of those who stood with us in the streets of Kyiv in the winter of 2004-2005 . 
We began the battle against entrenched corruption , imposed the rule of law on Ukraine &apos;s robber barons , and encouraged the birth of a vital civil society . 
Most Ukrainians feel more secure because of these changes . 
This is why our people should know precisely what they are voting for this Sunday . 
I have pledged that , under no circumstances will I form a coalition government with Viktor Yanukovych . 
President Yushchenko should do the same . 
Only by restoring our partnership can we hope to keep our Orange Revolution &apos;s promises . 
Criminal and civil codes will be enforced ; our courts will be allowed to find their feet and their freedom . 
Above all , the new Rada ( parliament ) will settle down to the business of enacting laws and monitoring the government , not carving up the budget among corrupt clans . 
We will fight for essential reforms to bring the country in line with European norms . 
Relations with Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia will be repaired . 
Elections are seldom make-or-break affairs . 
This one is . 
A Yanukovych restoration would be a disaster for Ukraine , for Russia , and for Europe , because it would put Ukraine &apos;s independence in question and tempt Russia with dreams of renewed empire . 
Only a second victory over Yanukovych can secure a future of freedom and hope for Ukraine &apos;s people .
