America &apos;s Failed Militarized Foreign Policy 
Many of today &apos;s war zones - including Afghanistan , Ethiopia , Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , Somalia , and Sudan - share basic problems that lie at the root of their conflicts . 
They are all poor , buffeted by natural disasters - especially floods , droughts , and earthquakes - and have rapidly growing populations that are pressing on the capacity of the land to feed them . 
And the proportion of youth is very high , with a bulging population of young men of military age ( 15-24 years ) . 
All of these problems can be solved only through long-term sustainable economic development . 
Yet the United States persists in responding to symptoms rather than to underlying conditions by trying to address every conflict by military means . 
It backs the Ethiopian army in Somalia . 
It occupies Iraq and Afghanistan . 
It threatens to bomb Iran . 
It supports the military dictatorship in Pakistan . 
None of these military actions addresses the problems that led to conflict in the first place . 
On the contrary , American policies typically inflame the situation rather than solve it . 
Time and again , this military approach comes back to haunt the US . 
The US embraced the Shah of Iran by sending massive armaments , which fell into the hands of Iran &apos;s Revolutionary Government after 1979 . 
The US then backed Saddam Hussein in his attack on Iran , until the US ended up attacking Saddam himself . 
The US backed Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan against the Soviets , until the US ended up fighting bin Laden . 
Since 2001 the US has supported Pervez Musharraf in Pakistan with more than $ 10 billion in aid , and now faces an unstable regime that just barely survives . 
US foreign policy is so ineffective because it has been taken over by the military . 
Even postwar reconstruction in Iraq under the US-led occupation was run by the Pentagon rather than by civilian agencies . 
The US military budget dominates everything about foreign policy . 
Adding up the budgets of the Pentagon , the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , the Department of Homeland Security , nuclear weapons programs , and the State Department &apos;s military assistance operations , the US will spend around $ 800 billion this year on security , compared with less than $ 20 billion for economic development . 
In a stunning article on aid to Pakistan during the Bush administration , Craig Cohen and Derek Chollet demonstrated the disastrous nature of this militarized approach - even before the tottering Musharraf regime &apos;s latest crackdown . 
They show that even though Pakistan faces huge problems of poverty , population , and environment , 75 % of the $ 10 billion in US aid has gone to the Pakistani military , ostensibly to reimburse Pakistan for its contribution to the &quot; war on terror , &quot; and to help it buy F-16s and other weapons systems . 
Another 16 % went straight to the Pakistani budget , no questions asked . 
That left less than 10 % for development and humanitarian assistance . 
Annual US aid for education in Pakistan has amounted to just $ 64 million , or $ 1.16 per school-aged child . 
The authors note that &quot; the strategic direction for Pakistan was set early by a narrow circle at the top of the Bush administration and has been largely focused on the war effort rather than on Pakistan &apos;s internal situation . &quot; 
They also emphasize that &quot; US engagement with Pakistan is highly militarized and centralized , with very little reaching the vast majority of Pakistanis . &quot; 
They quote George Bush as saying , &quot; When &#91; Musharraf &#93; looks me in the eye and says ... there won &apos;t be a Taliban and won &apos;t be al-Qaeda , I believe him , you know ? &quot; 
This militarized approach is leading the world into a downward spiral of violence and conflict . Each new US weapons system &quot; sold &quot; or given to the region increases the chances of expanded war and further military coups , and to the chance that the arms will be turned on the US itself . 
None of it helps to address the underlying problems of poverty , child mortality , water scarcity , and lack of livelihoods in places like Pakistan &apos;s Northwest Frontier Province , Sudan &apos;s Darfur region , or Somalia . 
These places are bulging with people facing a tightening squeeze of insufficient rainfall and degraded pasturelands . 
Naturally , many join radical causes . 
The Bush administration fails to recognize these fundamental demographic and environmental challenges , that $ 800 billion of security spending won &apos;t bring irrigation to Afghanistan , Pakistan , Sudan , and Somalia , and therefore won &apos;t bring peace . 
Instead of seeing real people in crisis , they see caricatures , a terrorist around every corner . 
A more peaceful world will be possible only when Americans and others begin to see things through the eyes of their supposed enemies , and realize that today &apos;s conflicts , having resulted from desperation and despair , can be solved through economic development rather than war . 
We will have peace when we heed the words of President John F. Kennedy , who said , a few months before his death , &quot; For , in the final analysis , our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet . 
We all breathe the same air . 
We all cherish our children &apos;s future .
