Mosque or Modernity ? 
PARIS - Whatever happened to the &quot; Arab Spring &quot; ? 
When demonstrations erupted in Tunisia , Egypt , and Libya , ultimately leading to the demise of three old and weary dictatorships , no one knew which forces , institutions , and procedures would emerge from the protesters &quot; demand for democracy . 
And yet , despite the unprecedented and unforeseeable nature of events - or perhaps because of it - hope ran high . 
What has happened since shows clearly what everyone knew ( or should have known ) all along : nothing about regime change is simple . 
None of the three countries has yet found a stable institutional solution that can defuse intensifying internal tensions and respond effectively to popular demands . 
Other countries in the region , including Yemen and some of the Gulf states , have experienced varying degrees of turmoil as well . 
Sectarian violence is once again consuming Iraq , while clashes between anti-regime factions in Syria are becoming ever more frequent , with Islamists seeking to gain the upper hand ahead of the political transition that would occur should the government collapse . 
Even in Morocco , a king with absolute power as Commander of the Faithful has been forced by intense public outrage to move toward a system more inclusive of political Islam . 
Likewise , developments in the region &apos;s two non-Arab powers suggest that neither is immune to instability . 
In Turkey , recent protests have highlighted growing opposition to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan &apos;s overweening power and divisive , religious-based social policies . 
In Iran , much of the middle class backed the most moderate of the candidates acceptable to the country &apos;s Islamic guardians in June &apos;s presidential elections . 
Several related factors underlie the region &apos;s chronic instability . 
One is underdevelopment . 
While oil has made a few presidents and princes staggeringly rich , the rest of the population has received little benefit . 
Hunger is widespread ; indeed , poverty and inequality have fueled much of the popular mobilization in the region . 
But the region &apos;s protest politics also reflects growing rejection of dictatorship and arbitrary rule . 
Despite these countries &quot; lack of a tradition of open dissent , globalization has made it plain to all that economic development requires regime change . 
Finally , political Islam is common to all of the region &apos;s conflicts , and should not be viewed - as it often is - in isolation from these countries &quot; economic woes . 
Simply put , Islam - one of the world &apos;s great religions , practiced by nearly one-quarter of humanity - missed its development takeoff . 
There are no easy ways out of underdevelopment without challenging traditional lifestyles , customs , and social relations . 
Indeed , religions do not resist the pressures of economic change well . 
For Jews , given the absence of a homeland , development occurred among the diaspora , with civil emancipation in Europe giving rise to reformist movements aimed at reconciling faith and modernity . 
Similarly , Christianity , whether Catholic or Orthodox , blocked economic development for centuries , until internal reformists redefined theological positions on money and banking , the nature of progress , and science and technology . 
It is no accident that religious reform in Scandinavia , Germany , England , the Netherlands , and the United States gave rise to today &apos;s global capitalism . 
This dynamic extends even to officially atheist China . 
Orthodox Communism , a perfect secular simulacrum of religion , has been the primary victim of development since China launched its market reforms in 1979 . 
Islam also has its reformists . 
Consider the mission entrusted to Rifa &apos;a al-Tahtawi , the great Egyptian scholar sent to Europe by Mohammed Ali in 1826 to learn about Western civilization and to try to forge an understanding between it and Islam . 
But everywhere in the Arab world , without exception , reformists have been jailed , killed , or reduced to political impotence . 
In the absence of an analog to the West &apos;s Industrial Revolution , Muslims ( and especially Arabs ) have faced multiple humiliations and partial colonization over the past two centuries . 
The resulting legacy of grievance , shame , and anger is part of what underpins the region &apos;s current malaise . 
Indeed , some of the street demonstrations leave no doubt that many people are moving away from religion altogether . 
This is as visible in Egypt and Tunisia as it is in Turkey . 
But the grim reality for the Islamic world is that , in times of widespread uncertainty , the forces of tradition tend to speak more loudly and clearly than those of change . 
Peace in this huge and strategically vital region - and thus in the world - can prevail only if its countries manage , despite their turmoil , to protect themselves from ideological extremes and political excesses . 
The importance of this should be abundantly clear to Westerners , whose modern civilization grew out of religious dissent that was initially met by the violence of the Inquisition and the Counter-Reformation . 
If Islam , particularly in the Middle East , is on a similar trajectory , long-term instability in the region is all but assured . 
Mutual understanding is the only way to moderate the consequences .
