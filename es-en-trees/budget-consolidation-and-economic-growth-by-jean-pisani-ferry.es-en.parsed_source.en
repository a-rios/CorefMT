Fiscal Closing Time ? 
BRUSSELS - Is it time for fiscal consolidation or stimulus ? 
Should governments cut or increase spending ? 
Once again the issue is a matter of dispute among policymakers and economists . 
Citizens , having been told in 2008-2009 that the imperative was to stimulate the economy , and in 2010-2011 that the time had come for retrenchment , are understandably confused . 
Should priorities once again be reversed ? 
At the International Monetary Fund &apos;s annual meeting in October , the Fund &apos;s chief economist , Olivier Blanchard fueled the controversy by pointing out that in recent times governments have tended to underestimate the adverse growth consequences of fiscal consolidation . 
They have typically assumed that to cut public spending by a dollar would reduce GDP by 50 cents in the short term ; according to Blanchard , the true outcome in current conditions is a decline by between $ 0.90-1.70 . 
That is a big gap , but also a perplexing finding : how can there be so much uncertainty ? 
Contrary to what such forecasting disparities may suggest , economists actually know a lot about the consequences of fiscal policy , at least much more than they used to know . 
Until the 1980 &quot; s , it was routinely assumed that the so-called &quot; multiplier &quot; - the ratio of change in GDP to the change in government spending - was stable and larger than one . 
A one-dollar spending cut was believed to reduce GDP by more than one dollar , so that fiscal retrenchment was economically costly ( while , conversely , stimulus was effective ) . 
Then came the counter-revolution , which advanced a long list of reasons why the multiplier was likely to be much lower . 
Cut spending , it was said , and inflation would fall . 
The central bank would lower interest rates ; households would spend in anticipation of lower taxes ; and business confidence would rise . 
In the end , there would be little , if any , damaging impact on output . 
Economists are a fractious lot , but they are also stubborn investigators , so the controversy prompted new research into the effects of budgetary retrenchments . 
New methods were developed to measure their impact ; new approaches were introduced to account for the possibility that the multiplier could vary over time ; and new data were compiled to incorporate better actual budgetary decisions . 
All of this effort paid off . 
There is now convincing evidence that the same decision to cut public spending can have very different consequences , depending on economic conditions . 
This may seem like Paradise for policy wonks , but it also has significant implications for government choices . 
The adverse short-term growth effects of a spending cut are likely to be largest when the economy is already in a recession , trade partners are also cutting spending or raising taxes , the central bank &apos;s interest rate is already near zero , and markets have no particular worries about the state &apos;s ability to repay its debt . 
In such conditions , like those of 2009 , the multiplier can be close to two . 
So it would have been lethal to embark on fiscal consolidation back then . 
It was right to stimulate . 
But when the economy is booming , the effects of fiscal retrenchment are unlikely to be damaging . 
So it was right to start planning for a change of gear when the recovery started to materialize . 
Things are trickier when public finances are under acute stress and markets are worried about sovereign solvency , as is the case in southern Europe . 
There is scant empirical evidence for this set of conditions , because such cases were rare until recently . 
But it is logical to consider that restoring the sustainability of public finances can have strongly positive effects on confidence and bond rates . 
At the same time , if the economy is already contracting sharply , as it often does in such situations , a spending cut is bound to have serious negative effects on domestic demand . 
The best way out of the dilemma is to undertake measures that improve long-term public finances without producing negative short-term effects , such as public pension reform . 
Increasing the retirement age , for example , improves the perspective for public finances , but it does not weigh on short-term demand . 
More generally , measures that credibly signal stronger public finances in the future are desirable - assuming , obviously , that governments still have some credibility . 
When it is squandered , as in Greece , promises have no value , and governments have no choice but to cut spending immediately . 
Understanding which conditions are being met when and where helps to set the agenda for today . 
The global economy currently is slowing ; several European countries - and the eurozone as a whole - are in recession ; central banks &quot; interest rates are exceptionally low , and unlikely to rise soon ; and most advanced countries are cutting public spending . 
This calls for caution with consolidation efforts . 
At the same time , public-debt ratios are still rising , and several countries have lost market access or are at risk of losing it , owing to the precarious state of their public finances . 
This , by contrast , implies a need for retrenchment . 
The prescription for policymakers is thus fourfold : 
路 
Whenever public-finance sustainability is at stake ( which is pretty much everywhere in the advanced world , except Australia , Canada , and a few northern European countries , including Germany ) , governments should continue consolidating , but at a moderate pace . 
路 
Governments should not increase consolidation efforts just because the slowdown reduces tax revenues , and should not aim at headline deficit targets for next year . 
路 
In acute fiscal stress , governments cannot afford to slow down consolidation . 
But they should place as much emphasis as possible on spending reforms that credibly improve the outlook while having limited adverse short-term effects . 
路 
Finally , officials everywhere should invest in institutions that help to convince markets of their commitment to public-finance sustainability . 
In hazardous conditions , officials should not rely on rosy scenarios and hope that they will be believed . 
Rather , they should communicate clearly to markets and citizens how they reason and what they intend to do .
