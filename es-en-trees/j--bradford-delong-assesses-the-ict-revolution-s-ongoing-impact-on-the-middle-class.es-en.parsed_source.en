The Internet &apos;s Next Act 
BERKELEY - Ten years ago , the world emerged from the dot-com bust and started to look more soberly at the Internet &apos;s potential . 
While speculative greed and fear of missing out might have overplayed the short-term outlook , the Internet &apos;s immense longer-term prospects were never in doubt . 
I , and other optimistic economists , assumed that free information and communication would herald an era of rapid productivity growth and improved wellbeing - to a greater or lesser extent - for everyone , regardless of their skills , wealth , or social background . 
Were we right ? 
In many respects , the revolution in information and communications technology ( ICT ) has delivered more than it promised - and often in unpredictable ways . 
For many , the true marvel of the digital age is its creation of a parallel universe . 
Anyone with a laptop and an Internet connection can gossip with ( or about ) virtual friends ; witness extraordinary events that may or may not have happened ; or play games in a mock world of incomparable complexity . 
The Internet has created a dreamscape that is accessible to all and that can inspire us to still greater heights of imagination . 
Indeed , those who scoff at the value of this should remember that ever since Homer sang around the hearth fire about the wrath of Achilles , dreams have been our greatest source of pleasure and inspiration . 
But the benefits of the Internet have come not just to those who work or play online . 
Everyone has gained to some degree . 
Go to a WalMart , Costco , Tesco , or Lidl superstore anywhere in the world , and compare the price , quality , and range of today &apos;s goods with those of a generation or two ago . 
This dramatic change for the better largely reflects the rapid development of global supply chains , with real-time monitoring of customer preferences enabling manufacturers located on the other side of the world to know instantly what , when , and how much to produce . 
There is much more to come . 
Companies are using the Internet to &quot; crowdsource &quot; new ideas , and even let customers co-design their own products . 
New Web-based platforms allow ordinary people - without money or special skills - to share their cars , spare bedrooms , or even do-it-yourself tools , thus challenging the dominance of global corporations . 
The &quot; Internet of Things &quot; is connecting simple household items - like a thermostat - to the Web , helping owners to save money and even reduce their carbon emissions . 
And yet we must still ask : Is everyone really benefiting in the new economy ? 
Only a fortunate few , especially those who combine innovative thinking with financial acumen , have fully captured the monetary profits of the ICT revolution , becoming its poster children in the process . 
Lower down the economic scale , most people , though enjoying easy access to technology and low prices , have lost ground , with real wages falling for many years . 
This is not a temporary decline : labor in advanced Western economies can no longer command a large wage premium , and workers &quot; situation may worsen further . 
Moreover , white-collar managers and employees - the brainpower that keeps the intricate global corporate machinery whirring , and once the backbone of the middle class - are no longer in such high demand . 
Many of their skills , which long underpinned their status , careers , and livelihoods , are becoming redundant . 
For today &apos;s ordinary middle-class family , a medical mishap can become a financial catastrophe . 
Owning a home involves a life of indebtedness . 
Providing a decent education to one &apos;s children requires struggle and sacrifice . 
The assumptions that defined middle-class households - and many working-class households - for at least two generations are disappearing before our eyes . 
Who is speaking out for them ? 
Most households stand to gain from the continuation of the ICT revolution . 
But middle-class and working-class families would benefit more if the hyper-cheap products and services , free information , and virtual leisure experiences augmented , rather than eroded , their marketable skills . 
The politician who can figure out how to steer the revolution accordingly might never lose another election .
