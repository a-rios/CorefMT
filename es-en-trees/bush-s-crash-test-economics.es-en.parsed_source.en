Bush &apos;s Crash Test Economics 
Fifteen years ago , the United States was in the midst of what you could call its &quot; Age of Diminished Expectations . &quot; 
Productivity gains had stalled , energy prices were high , the backlog of potential technologies that originated in the Great Depression had been exhausted , and waning benefits from economies of scale led nearly every economist to project that economic growth would be slower in the future than it had been in the past . 
With productivity growth stagnating for almost two decades , it made sense back then to argue that the US government &apos;s social-insurance commitments ( Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid ) were excessive and so had to be scaled back . 
That was then , this is now . 
The intervening years have seen an explosion of technological innovation that has carried America &apos;s general productivity growth back up to its pre-slowdown levels . 
Indeed , today the US economy is standing on the brink of biotechnological and , perhaps , nanotechnological revolutions of vast scale and scope . 
Yet the same calls to scale back America &apos;s social commitments are heard . 
Social Security &apos;s actuaries may not have fully recognized the impact of today &apos;s technological revolutions , but they have markedly boosted the scale of the system that the US government can afford . 
Fifteen years ago , the consensus was that America &apos;s Social Security System was in huge trouble , that it needed the equivalent of an engine rebuild . 
Today its problems look , as the Brookings Institution economist Peter Orszag says , much more like the equivalent of a slow tire leak : you have to fix it eventually , but it isn &apos;t very hard to do and repair it isn &apos;t terribly urgent . 
So why is the Bush administration spending time and energy proposing radical changes to the Social Security System as its signature domestic policy initiative - indeed , as virtually its only policy initiative ? 
Everyone who worries about America &apos;s weak fiscal position puts Social Security &apos;s relatively small funding imbalance far down the list of priorities . 
The highest priority problem is the overall budget &apos;s medium-run outlook , as the Bush tax cuts have opened Reagan-size deficits that threaten to cripple US economic growth . 
The second highest priority problem is figuring out what to do in the long term with Medicare and Medicaid . 
America must decide the size of its public health programs and how to finance them . 
In reality , this is more of an opportunity than a problem : if we did not expect that doctors and nurses will be able to do marvelous things in a generation or two that they cannot do now , we would not be projecting serious fiscal deficits arising from the health programs . 
The third most serious problem is to put the US government &apos;s General Fund budget on a sustainable basis , so that the non-Social Security government can finance itself and meet its commitments after the date - around 2020 - when it can no longer borrow from the Social Security Trust Fund . 
The bottom line is that Social Security &apos;s long-term funding difficulty , while real , is projected to be much smaller and much further in the future than any of the nearer , larger , and more significant fiscal problems currently facing the US government . 
If Social Security is a slow tire leak , then the post-2020 General Fund is an urgent brake job , Medicare and Medicaid are a melted transmission , and the budget deficit is the equivalent of having just crashed into a tree . 
What kind of driver , owning a car that has just crashed into a tree , has a burned-out transmission , and needs a brake job , says , &quot; The most important thing is to fix this slow leak in the right rear tire ? &quot; 
George W. Bush is that type of driver . 
There are three theories as to why the Bush administration is focusing on Social Security . 
The first is simple incompetence : Bush and his inner circle simply do not understand the magnitude and importance of the federal government &apos;s other fiscal problems . 
The second is ideology . 
For some reason Bush and his people think it is important to undermine the successes of the New Deal institutions established under Franklin Roosevelt . 
The third reason is bureaucratic capture : just as the principal aim of Bush &apos;s Medicare Drug Benefit bill of 2003 was to boost pharmaceutical company profits , so the Bush administration &apos;s Social Security proposal will most likely be tailored to the interests of Wall Street . 
I don &apos;t see any other , more pressing , reforms - such as raising income taxes to pay for national security - gaining any traction in the Bush regime . 
If I had to bet on a cause , I would put my money on sheer incompetence . 
After all , that seems to be the common denominator of every policy controlled by his White House .
