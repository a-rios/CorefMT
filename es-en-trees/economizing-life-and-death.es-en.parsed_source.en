Economizing Life and Death 
Have you ever sat at the deathbed of a statistical life ? 
&quot; Statistical lives &quot; are what politicians save , or let die , or kill , when they decide on resource allocations for health care . 
Health care is not the only area where political decisions are matters of life and death . 
Environmental programs to reduce air pollution , educational efforts to publicize the adverse effects of smoking , traffic measures that lower the risk of car accidents : many policies save lives - and omit other lives that would have been saved if the money had been spent otherwise . 
So , if you have ever sat at somebody &apos;s deathbed , the answer may very well be yes : you sat at the deathbed of a statistical life . 
Even so , we say that John died from cancer , not that he died from a policy decision to stop payment for cancer screening . 
We say that Mary died in a car accident , not that she was a casualty of the Road Traffic Act . 
In short , we do not usually identify policy decisions as the causes of individual deaths . 
This would be quite different if the identities of future victims were known at the time such decisions are taken . 
Imagine that they were known , and that the individual victims of policy decisions would somehow stare into the faces of decision makers just as if they were being held at gunpoint . 
Policy making , I am sure , would suddenly halt . 
In fact , the analogy of holding victims at gunpoint is misleading , because in public decision-making we can hardly claim that everything is all right as long as we don &apos;t pull the trigger . 
Given that everything that happens is somehow a consequence of decision-making , the distinction between killing someone and letting her die is unconvincing . 
So perhaps decision makers , faced with the victims of previous policies and the future victims of current ones , would simply be happy that at last they could allocate resources in an optimally efficient way . 
That seems unlikely . 
Indeed , the thought experiment of turning statistical lives into identifiable lives highlights an important point about policy-making : much , if not all , of the appeal of &quot; efficient &quot; resource allocation depends on the anonymity of the victims . 
Full anonymity explains why efficiency rules - say , leaving the most &quot; expensive &quot; patients untreated when resources are scarce - meet with no protest . 
Such anonymity also holds for those who are left untreated in &quot; triage &quot; - the sorting of casualties when natural or man-made disasters strike . 
It is part of the everyday life of many citizens - even part of their identities - that they suffer from an expensive health problem . 
Under an efficiency regime , they might as well bear a target on their foreheads . 
What about young and healthy citizens ? 
Many will develop expensive health problems in the future . 
Why should they not fully embrace efficient resource allocation ? 
Many statistical lives - your own , perhaps - could be saved by excluding future payment for some expensive medical treatment ( say , hemodialysis ) for those who are now healthy and reallocating the funds to cheap but effective prevention programs . 
Since there is no fairness problem here , would it not simply be irrational to reject efficiency ? 
After all , saving statistical lives does save individuals . 
Whether or not you see a distinction between statistical lives and individual lives depends on whether you accord value not only to when you die , but also to how you die . 
Dying is hard . 
Nevertheless , as long as we see a chance to escape death , we run from it , and we expect those who take care of us to look for the escape routes . 
So here is a difference : when you die from lack of medical care , there is an escape route . 
It is clearly marked , but nobody helps you get to it . 
They stand idly by , abandoning you to death . 
By contrast , when you die from the absence of prevention policies , you may be dying sooner than you otherwise would , but you are not being left to die . 
This is why sitting beside , and even lying on , the deathbed of a statistical life may be more tolerable after all . 
Perhaps a maximally extended life expectancy is of higher value to you than living in a society where doctors do not leave curable patients to die if they cannot pay for the required treatment out of their own pockets . 
But there is nothing irrational in deciding otherwise . 
It all depends on a value judgment - one of the many value judgments societies must make with respect to modern medicine . 
The higher the technical capabilities , and the costs , of modern medicine become , the more contested this particular value judgment will be .
