Out in Eighteen Months or One Hundred Years ? 
BLOOMINGTON , INDIANA - Winston Churchill once said that , in wartime , truth was so precious that it needed to be surrounded by a &quot; bodyguard of lies . &quot; 
In America &apos;s presidential campaign - and , sadly , within Iraq itself nowadays - the Iraq War may not be surrounded by a bodyguard of lies , but it has certainly picked up a vast entourage of partisan half-truths , cynical indifference , and uninformed stubbornness . 
America &apos;s Democrats continue to argue for complete withdrawal of United States forces from Iraq within 18 months , despite the fact that no rational observer believes that Iraqi forces will by then be able to secure Iraq &apos;s borders and face down the country &apos;s numerous militias , which remain armed to the teeth . 
Indeed , the Democratic plan ( if it can be called one ) ignores Iran &apos;s ongoing subversion of Iraq &apos;s state institutions , which will continue unless and until they become strong enough to resist such machinations . 
Moreover , Barack Obama &apos;s insistence that Iraq has never constituted a central front in the war on terror insults the memory of tens of thousands - perhaps hundreds of thousands - of Iraqi civilians and US troops murdered by al-Qaeda &apos;s suicide bombers since 2003 . 
Indeed , by 2004 , the terrorists themselves regarded Iraq as the central front of their campaign . 
Nor can one be buoyed by Joseph Biden &apos;s repeated calls for a &quot; soft partition &quot; of Iraq , even though the entire Iraqi political class has rejected the notion . 
As for the Republicans , setting aside Sarah Palin &apos;s talk of America &apos;s divine mission in the war on terror , it is inconceivable that John McCain truly believes that a US presence is sustainable in Iraq into the indefinite future . 
To be fair , McCain never suggested that US troops will wage 100 years of war , as some of his critics claim . 
What McCain was referring to was a peaceable presence of US forces in the country for a long period , rather like their continued presence in Japan since 1945 . 
Still , even assuming that the American public would tolerate such a presence , the Iraqi public would not . 
America has made too many policy mistakes , US forces are too closely associated with an unpopular and incompetent occupation , and , until recently , their tactics have been too thuggish to permit talk of a permanent presence . 
While most Iraqis understand the need for US forces to be in their country for the short term , they will not abide a permanent deployment . 
McCain &apos;s advisors would do well to consider a historical precedent : the failed British attempt at World War I &apos;s close to maintain a long-term military presence in Iraq . 
Iraqi politicians have not been exempt from posturing for political gain . 
The government committed a number of blunders in its negotiations on the continued presence of US troops . 
Indeed , this summer it injected itself into the US elections by seeming to endorse Obama &apos;s plan for early withdrawal . 
Then again , for three consecutive years , Iraq &apos;s national security advisor - a physician with no credentials for the job when appointed by the US occupation authority , except that he spoke tolerable English - insisted that the next year would be the last in which American troops were needed . 
Iraq &apos;s government is demanding a withdrawal timetable from the US , not because it believes that Iraqi forces will be ready to take over soon , but to burnish its nationalist credentials ahead of next year &apos;s parliamentary elections . 
Thus , it hopes to divert public attention from still non-existent basic services , continuing sectarianism , weak oil production , scant infrastructure investment , and rampant corruption and cronyism . 
Whether this strategy will succeed in obscuring the government &apos;s record of failure in the minds of voters remains to be seen . 
The problem now for Iraqi and US politicians is that , to act rationally , they will need to face down elements within their own constituencies . 
They must recognize that a long-term presence by US troops is out of the question , but that US combat forces will be needed in Iraq - albeit with a diminishing role - for the next five years . 
Only such a presence can consolidate the palpable , but still reversible , gains made over the past year . 
Such a force is needed to continue pursuing al-Qaeda , and to counteract pro-Iranian activities . 
Ending US involvement before the Iraqis can achieve these goals on their own would be disastrous for both US and Iraqi interests . 
In the meantime , US forces must support Iraqi efforts to strengthen the country &apos;s own military and security forces , while simultaneously disbanding all militias . 
Iraq &apos;s militias will not go quietly , yet their dissolution is essential for long-term stability , itself a sine qua non for stability in the region . 
When these missions are accomplished - but not sooner - US forces should withdraw from Iraq .
