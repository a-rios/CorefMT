The Right Choices for 2015 
WASHINGTON , DC - As 2015 begins , policymakers around the world are faced with three fundamental choices : to strive for economic growth or accept stagnation ; to work to improve stability or risk succumbing to fragility ; and to cooperate or go it alone . 
The stakes could not be higher ; 2015 promises to be a make-or-break year for the global community . 
For starters , growth and jobs are needed to support prosperity and social cohesion in the wake of the Great Recession that began in 2008 . 
Six years after the eruption of the financial crisis , the recovery remains weak and uneven . 
Global growth is projected at just 3.3 % in 2014 and 3.8 % in 2015 . 
Some important economies are still fighting deflation . 
More than 200 million people are unemployed . 
The global economy risks getting stuck in a &quot; new mediocre &quot; - a prolonged period of slow growth and feeble job creation . 
To break free from stagnation , we need renewed policy momentum . 
If the measures agreed by the leaders assembled at the G-20 in November are implemented , they will lift world GDP by more than 2 % by 2018 - the equivalent of adding $ 2 trillion in global income . 
Furthermore , by 2025 , if the laudable - yet not overly ambitious - goal of closing the gender gap by 25 % is achieved , 100 million women could have jobs that they didn &apos;t have before . 
Global leaders have asked the International Monetary Fund to monitor the implementation of these growth strategies . 
We will do so , country by country , reform by reform . 
Besides structural reforms , building new momentum will require pulling all possible levers that can support global demand . 
Accommodative monetary policy will remain essential for as long as growth remains anemic - though we must pay careful attention to potential spillovers . 
Fiscal policy should be focused on promoting growth and creating jobs , while maintaining medium-term credibility . 
As we ponder the second choice , between stability and fragility , we must consider how we can make our increasingly interconnected world a safer place . 
Financial integration has risen tenfold since World War II . 
National economies are so interconnected that shifts in market sentiment tend to cascade globally . 
It is therefore critical that we complete the agenda on financial-sector reform . 
To be sure , there has been progress , especially on banking regulation and on addressing too-big-to-fail financial institutions . 
We also need better rules for nonbanks , stricter monitoring of shadow banks , and improved safeguards and more transparency in the derivatives markets . 
Progress on closing data gaps in the financial sector is urgently needed as well , so that regulators can properly assess risks to financial stability . 
Most important , the culture of the financial sector needs to change . 
The principal purpose of finance is to provide services to the other parts of the economy , which it cannot do unless it enjoys the confidence of those who depend on those services - that is , all of us . 
Restoring trust should therefore start with an all-out effort to promote and enforce ethical behavior throughout the industry . 
The third choice , whether to cooperate or go it alone , is the most critical . 
No economy is an island ; indeed , the global economy is more integrated than ever before . 
Consider this : Fifty years ago , emerging markets and developing economies accounted for about a quarter of world GDP . 
Today , they generate half of global income , a share that will continue to rise . 
But sovereign states are no longer the only actors on the scene . 
A global network of new stakeholders has emerged , including NGOs and citizen activists - often empowered by social media . 
This new reality demands a new response . 
We will need to update , adapt , and deepen our methods of working together . 
This can be done by building on effective institutions of cooperation that already exist . 
Institutions like the IMF should be made even more representative in light of the dynamic shifts taking place in the global economy . 
The new networks of influence should be embraced and given space in the twenty-first century architecture of global governance . 
This is what I have called the &quot; new multilateralism . &quot; 
I believe it is the only way to address the challenges that the global community faces . 
The year 2014 was a tough one . 
The recovery was slow , a series of dangerous geopolitical risks emerged , and the world was confronted with a devastating Ebola outbreak . 
This year may be another tough one , but it could also be a good one - a truly multilateral year . 
New momentum on global trade could help unlock investment worldwide , and I am hopeful about the new Sustainable Development Goals ( which will succeed the Millennium Development Goals in 2015 ) , and about the prospects for a comprehensive climate-change agreement at the end of this year . 
Against this backdrop , the adoption of the IMF reforms by the United States Congress would send a long-overdue signal to rapidly growing emerging economies that the world counts on their voices , and their resources , to find global solutions to global problems . 
Growth , trade , development , and climate change : 2015 will be a rendezvous of important multilateral initiatives . 
We cannot afford to see them fail . 
Let us make the right choices .
