Iran &apos;s Failing &quot; Mullahnomics &quot; 
ISTANBUL - As the stand-off between Iran &apos;s government and opposition continues , one factor that may determine the outcome , but which is rarely discussed , is the rickety state of the Iranian economy . 
Will its sclerotic performance ultimately turn out to be what tips the balance ? 
Iran &quot; s economy has struggled ever since the Islamic Revolution , partly because of the economic embargo imposed by the United States three decades ago . 
Today , with Iran starved of technology and spare parts for existing equipment , OPEC &apos;s second-largest oil producer in 2006 has become a net importer of refined petroleum products . 
Indeed , conditions in Iran &apos;s oil industry had so deteriorated in 2007 that gasoline rationing was introduced , opening the way to a thriving black market . 
Such shortages , no surprise , have stoked inflation . 
In November 2009 , the Iranian Central Bank ( Bank Markazi ) reported a 22 % annual rise in the price level . 
To spur investment , new measures have been undertaken to allow foreign banks to enter the Iranian financial system . 
Many have applied , but no license has yet been granted . 
A clear sign of the rot in Iran &apos;s economy can be found in economic relations between Iran and Turkey . 
Trade links between the two countries are old and deep-rooted , and they were supposed to benefit after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s visit to Turkey in 2008 , when it was decided that bilateral trade should double , to $ 20 billion , by 2011 , and reach $ 30 billion in 2012 . 
Turkey &apos;s government even allowed Turkish exporters to bill in Iranian rials . 
But , while political leaders drew up such rosy plans , eight of Turkey &apos;s largest investors in Iran were withdrawing from the country . 
According to one of the firms , &quot; investment conditions are unclear in Iran , &quot; and it left without even seeking compensation for its 60 % share in a company it had created . 
Other Turkish investors express similar complaints . 
Cesur Ambalaj pulled out because of &quot; unkept promises . &quot; 
TAV Holding , which won the tender for the construction of the new Khomeini airport in Tehran , was never even given the chance to start the job . 
Another company , Gubretas , which had bought Razi , one of Iran &apos;s biggest petrochemical companies , for $ 650 million dollars in 2008 , has not yet been able to start production , owing to administrative restrictions . 
Moreover , the proposed truck route between the Turkish Black Sea port of Trabzon and the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas has not yet materialized because of Iran &apos;s hesitation . 
The list of such mishaps and missed opportunities is long . 
According to the vice-president of the Iranian-Turkish Business Council , &quot; it is extremely complicated to do business in Iran . &quot; 
A former Turkish diplomat in Iran described the business climate in stark terms : &quot; it is as if Iranians prefer a lose / lose outcome to a win / win one in their dealings with foreign partners . &quot; 
What lessons can be drawn from the failure of Turkish businesses in Iran ? Some blame appalling infrastructure and high road taxes . 
Others suggest that Iran &apos;s almost non-existent banking system is the culprit . 
Still others blame the &quot; invisible hand of America , &quot; which is supposed to fear that Iran and Turkey could become too powerful . 
But the real source of Iran &apos;s dysfunctional economy is the country &apos;s peculiar political and economic power-sharing . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , the Iranian economy is almost totally controlled by political actors . 
Twenty thousand public companies consume 65 % of the national budget and handle 80 % of exports , as well as 50 % of internal trade . 
The market share of state-owned banks is 85 % . 
These public companies make up what is called the 
Parallel to the bonyads , another economic network has emerged around the basij , the paramilitary force linked to the pasdaran ( Revolutionary Guards ) , who are in turn closely connected to Ahmadinejad . 
Since he became president , Ahmadinejad has encouraged this basij economy , and today the pasdaran are granted trading licenses and exclusive control and use of some ports . 
These two networks are very often in competition , if not in conflict , with each other , reflecting the current Iranian political turmoil . 
Adding to the confusion , another group , the sarrafs ( primarily private money lenders ) are the key interface between foreign investors and an Iranian counterpart , whether basij or bonyad . 
They have trading licenses ( karti bazargani ) while foreigners do not , and thus they are also party to all trade deals . 
Under such circumstances , it is no wonder that doing business in Iran is a labyrinthine nightmare . 
These internal conflicts have worsened with the country &apos;s domestic political crisis and the global economic crisis . 
Irrationality seems to have taken over . 
For example , Iran &apos;s mullahs shut down the air route between Tehran and Antalya because it gave Iranians access to &quot; sinful &quot; leisure in Turkey , but it was replaced by a Tehran-Sparta route , which flies Iranians 140 kilometers away just making the trip slightly longer ! 
Riven by such blinkered thinking , Iran seems incapable of making headway on even the most sensible policy . 
For example , Iran has not yet ratified international economic agreements such as the Economic Cooperation Organization Trade Agreement ( ECOTA ) , which would strengthen its economic ties with its neighbors , all of which are Muslim countries . 
The most dangerous time for a country , it is said , comes when it starts to reform . 
Iran &apos;s economy has yet to reach such a moment .
