Germany versus the Euro 
BERLIN - Usually , people or institutions are taken to court when things go wrong and a fight ensues about who is liable for the damage . 
So the German Constitutional Court &apos;s hearing on June 11-12 to consider the legality of the European Central Bank &apos;s so-called outright monetary transactions ( OMT ) program was peculiar . 
Here is a fight over the single most successful monetary-policy measure of recent decades - not just in Europe , but anywhere . 
The announcement of the OMT scheme in July 2012 reduced interest rates for companies and governments alike and returned much-needed private capital to crisis-hit countries , thereby helping to soften the blow of the deep recession on Europe &apos;s periphery . 
It also brought back that scarcest of assets : confidence in the viability of the eurozone economy and its currency , the euro . 
Best of all , none of these achievements has cost a single euro . 
All that was required was a mere statement by ECB President Mario Draghi and its Governing Council that it would do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to buy eurozone members &quot; sovereign debt , conditional on their fulfillment of stringent fiscal conditions . 
No country has come forward so far . 
But , while the OMT program &apos;s positive impact on financial markets is proof of its success , it has come under fierce attack by the German public , political parties , and economists . 
A recent poll shows that only one-third of Germans now favor the scheme , while a majority oppose it . 
Why would anyone , especially a European , want to kill a program that so far has helped to save the common currency ? 
The OMT scheme &apos;s German opponents argue that it is unconstitutional , because it is not monetary policy , but fiscal policy aimed at financing insolvent and lethargic eurozone governments . 
They argue that it is not the ECB &apos;s job to rescue the euro or to prevent countries from exiting the monetary union . 
These complaints are all the more peculiar given that Germany is a major beneficiary of the OMT announcement : its direct financial risks , via balances in the eurozone &apos;s Target2 system and the size of the ECB &apos;s balance sheet , have shrunk , despite the eurozone recession . 
Given these benefits , it seems masochistic for Germans to oppose the ECB &apos;s strategy . 
So , again , why is there so much resistance to it in Germany ? 
One part of the answer lies in Germany &apos;s strong culture of Ordnungspolitik , or stability policy , which almost always gives precedence to rules over discretion . 
Success can mean failure if it is achieved with questionable tools . 
A second reason is that Germans are fed up with being Europe &apos;s scapegoat - blamed for their neighbors &quot; ills while being asked to take on risks and provide generous financial transfers . 
Indeed , among some of Germany &apos;s intellectual elite , mistrust toward Europe and its institutions now runs so deep that any new European policy measure is suspected of being a plot to get German money . 
This view is gaining ground politically as well , with a new , explicitly anti-euro party , Alternative for Germany , rising quickly . 
Moreover , an increasing number of Germans , openly or secretly , want to have the Deutschemark back . 
The problem is that they could get what they wish for . 
If the German Constitutional Court imposes limits on the OMT program , the consequences would be dire , for it would render the ECB &apos;s guarantee to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; ineffective . 
Financial markets would undoubtedly react swiftly , reviving the fears of last summer . 
With no policy institution able to take charge , countries like Italy and Spain would return to the brink of panic-induced insolvency . 
A deep European depression would result , almost certainly dragging down the German economy and reversing the European integration process . 
The German Constitutional Court is , in fact , unlikely to prohibit the OMT program . 
There is only one sensible way forward . 
Germany &apos;s European partners , especially France , must persuade it to re-engage with Europe and assume responsibility for European integration . 
German leaders &quot; opposition to every proposal for institutional reform may be excusable now , in the run-up to the general election in September .
