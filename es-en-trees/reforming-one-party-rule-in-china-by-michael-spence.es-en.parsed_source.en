President Xi &apos;s Singapore Lessons 
NEW YORK - China is at a crucial point today , as it was in 1978 , when the market reforms launched by Deng Xiaoping opened its economy to the world - and as it was again in the early 1990 &quot; s , when Deng &apos;s famous &quot; southern tour &quot; reaffirmed the country &apos;s development path . 
Throughout this time , examples and lessons from other countries have been important . 
Deng was reportedly substantially influenced by an early visit to Singapore , where accelerated growth and prosperity had come decades earlier . 
Understanding other developing countries &quot; successes and shortcomings has been - and remains - an important part of China &apos;s approach to formulating its growth strategy . 
Like Singapore , Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan in their first few decades of modern growth , China has been ruled by a single party . 
Singapore &apos;s People &apos;s Action Party ( PAP ) remains dominant , though that appears to be changing . 
The others evolved into multi-party democracies during the middle-income transition . 
China , too , has now reached this critical last leg of the long march to advanced-country status in terms of economic structure and income levels . 
Singapore should continue to be a role model for China , despite its smaller size . 
The success of both countries reflects many contributing factors , including a skilled and educated group of policymakers supplied by a meritocratic selection system , and a pragmatic , disciplined , experimental , and forward-looking approach to policy . 
The other key lesson from Singapore is that single-party rule has retained popular legitimacy by delivering inclusive growth and equality of opportunity in a multi-ethnic society , and by eliminating corruption of all kinds , including cronyism and excessive influence for vested interests . 
What Singapore &apos;s founder , Lee Kwan Yew , and his colleagues and successors understood is that the combination of single-party rule and corruption is toxic . 
If you want the benefits of the former , you cannot allow the latter . 
Coherence , long time horizons , appropriate incentives , strong &quot; navigational &quot; skills , and decisiveness are desirable aspects of continuity in governance , especially in a meritocratic system managing complex structural shifts . 
To protect that and maintain public support for the investments and policies that sustain growth , Singapore needed to prevent corruption from gaining a foothold , and to establish consistency in the application of rules . 
Lee did that , with the PAP supplying what a full formal system of public accountability would have provided . 
China , too , most likely wants to retain , at least for a while , the benefits of single-party rule , and delay the transition to &quot; messier &quot; governance influenced by multiple voices . 
In fact , a pluralistic system is already evolving under the umbrella of the Chinese Communist Party - a process that may eventually lead to citizens gaining an institutionalized voice in public policy . 
For now , however , those representative elements that have been added incrementally are not powerful enough to overcome the growing corruption and excessive influence of vested interests . 
To maintain single-party legitimacy - and thus the ability to govern - those narrower interests must be overridden in favor of the general interest . 
That is the challenge that China &apos;s new leadership faces . 
If China &apos;s leaders succeed , they can then have a sensible and nuanced debate about the evolving role of the state in their economy , a debate on the merits . 
Many insiders and external advisers believe that the state &apos;s role must change ( not necessarily decline ) to create the dynamic innovative economy that is key to navigating the middle-income transition successfully . 
But there remain many areas in which further debate and choice are needed . 
Lee Kwan Yew in Singapore and Mao Zedong and Deng in China gained their peoples &quot; trust as founders and initial reformers . 
But that trust dissipates ; succeeding generations of leaders do not inherit it completely , and must earn it . 
That is all the more reason for them to heed the lessons of history . 
China &apos;s new leaders should first reassert the Party &apos;s role as defender of the general interest by creating an environment in which narrow interests , seeking to protect their growing influence and wealth , do not taint complex policy choices . 
They must demonstrate that the Party &apos;s power , legitimacy , and substantial assets are held in trust for the benefit of all Chinese , above all by fostering a pattern of inclusive growth and a system of equal opportunity with a meritocratic foundation . 
And then they should return to the task of governing in a complex domestic and global environment . 
There are times when muddling through - or , in the Chinese version , crossing the river by feeling the stones - is the right governing strategy , and there are times when a bold resetting of values and direction is required . 
Successful leaders know what time it is . 
Feeling the stones may seem like the safest option for China &apos;s next president , Xi Jinping , and China &apos;s other new leaders ; in fact , it is the most dangerous . 
The only safe option is a radical realignment of the Party with the general interest . 
The issue , then , is whether the reformers who carry the real spirit of the 1949 revolution will win the battle for equitable and inclusive growth . 
The optimistic ( and I believe realistic ) view is that the Chinese people , through a variety of channels , including social media , will weigh in , empowering reformers to push through a progressive agenda . 
Time will tell . 
But it is hard to overstate the outcome &apos;s importance to the rest of the world . 
Virtually all developing countries - and , increasingly , the advanced countries as well - will be affected one way or another as they , too , struggle to achieve stable and sustainable growth and employment patterns .
