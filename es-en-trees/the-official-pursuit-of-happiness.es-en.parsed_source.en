The Official Pursuit of Happiness 
CAMBRIDGE - In a time of tight budgets and financial crisis , politicians nowadays look to economic growth as the centerpiece of their domestic policy programs . 
Gross domestic product is taken to be the leading indicator of national well-being . 
But , as we look ahead to 2011 and beyond , we should ask ourselves : is it really wise to accord such importance to growth ? 
Granted , many studies have confirmed that wealthier nations tend to be happier than poor ones , and that rich people are generally more satisfied than their less affluent fellow citizens . 
Yet other findings from several relatively well-to-do countries , such as South Korea and the United States , suggest that people there are essentially no happier today than they were 50 years ago , despite a doubling or quadrupling of average per capita income . 
Moreover , in a recent Canadian study , the happiest people turned out to reside in the poorest provinces , such as Newfoundland and Nova Scotia , while citizens in the richest provinces , notably Ontario and British Columbia , were among the least happy . 
Since happiness is ultimately what people want the most , while wealth is only a means to that end , the primacy now accorded to economic growth would appear to be a mistake . 
What seems clear from such research is that people do quite poorly at predicting what will make them happy or sad . 
They focus too much on their initial responses to changes in their lives and overlook how quickly the pleasure of a new car , a pay increase , or a move to sunnier climes will fade , leaving them no happier than before . 
It is hazardous , therefore , for politicians simply to rely on opinion polls and focus groups to discover what will truly enhance people &apos;s happiness . 
In the findings to date , however , two conclusions have emerged that seem especially useful for policymakers to ponder . 
First , most of the things that do bring enduring satisfaction for individuals are also good for other people - strong marriages and close relationships of all kinds , helping others , engaging in civic affairs , and effective , honest , democratic government . 
Thus , policies that promote individual well-being tend to benefit society as well . 
Second , experiences that bring lasting pleasure or unhappiness do not always command a high priority in government circles . 
For example , three medical afflictions that create especially acute and enduring distress - clinical depression , chronic pain , and sleep disorders - are all conditions that can often be treated successfully , to the vast relief of sufferers . 
But such people are frequently underserved by health-care systems . 
The natural response to all this is to ask whether happiness research is really reliable enough to be used by policymakers . 
Researchers have paid close attention to this issue , and , after much testing , have found that the answers people give to questions about their well-being seem to correspond fairly well to more objective evidence . 
People who claim to be happy tend to live longer , commit suicide and abuse drugs and alcohol less often , get promoted more frequently by their employers , and enjoy more good friends and lasting marriages . 
Their assessments of their own well-being also align quite closely with the opinions of friends and family members . 
So , overall , statistics about happiness seem to be as accurate as many of the statistics regularly used by politicians , such as public-opinion polls , poverty rates , or , for that matter , GDP growth - all of which are riddled with imperfections . 
Of course , happiness research is still new . 
Many questions remain unexplored , some studies lack sufficient confirmatory evidence , and still others , like those involving the effects of economic growth , have yielded conflicting results . 
Thus , it would be premature to base bold new policies on happiness research alone , or to follow the example of tiny Bhutan by adopting Gross National Happiness as the nation &apos;s principal goal . 
Yet the findings may be useful to lawmakers even today - for example , in assigning priorities among several plausible initiatives , or in identifying new possibilities for policy interventions that deserve further study . 
At the very least , governments should follow Great Britain and France and consider publishing regular statistics on trends in the well-being of their citizens . 
Such findings will surely stimulate useful public discussion while yielding valuable data for investigators to use . 
Beyond that , who knows ? 
Further research will doubtless provide more detailed and reliable information about the kinds of policies that add to people &apos;s happiness . 
Someday , perhaps , public officials may even use the research to inform their decisions . 
After all , what could matter more to their constituents than happiness ? 
In a democracy , at least , that should surely count for something .
