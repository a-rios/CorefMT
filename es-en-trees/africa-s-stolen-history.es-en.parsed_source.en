Africa &apos;s Stolen History 
NAIROBI - The news that Yale University has agreed to return thousands of artifacts that one of its researchers took from Peru in 1911 reminded me of a party that I attended recently - one that I had to leave prematurely . 
An African friend had invited me to the event , at an acquaintance &apos;s home . 
The host , a wealthy American , proudly displayed his collection of paintings and sculptures . 
As he showed us around , there was one object that appeared to be African , but I wasn &apos;t sure ; on occasion , I have identified art as African only to learn that it was , in fact , Native American . 
The piece was an animal skin stretched and decorated with colored beads , and framed behind glass . 
The beads were the same kind that my people , the Maasai , use , but the dominant color was blue , not our preferred red . 
&quot; Where is that from ? &quot; 
&quot; That is from Zimbabwe , &quot; our host replied . 
&quot; It &apos;s a wedding skirt that was worn in a Ndebele royal wedding in 1931 . &quot; 
For an African away from home , finding even the most insignificant African object on display can make you happy . 
When I see Kenyan or Ethiopian coffee for sale in New York or Paris , for example , it makes me proud that there are Americans and Europeans who consider a product from my homeland valuable . 
Learning that a wealthy American had found a traditional African skirt worthy of a place in his home triggered the same feeling . 
But our host &apos;s next remark erased it instantly . 
He boasted that he had acquired the skirt illegally through a friend who had &quot; paid &quot; a Zimbabwean government official to smuggle it out of the country . 
My friend and I looked at each other , trying hard not to show our disapproval . 
&quot; I &apos;m so disgusted , &quot; my friend said a moment later . 
&quot; Let &apos;s leave before I get drunk and say something inappropriate to this guy . &quot; 
We left the party . 
On the way home , we ranted angrily about what we had witnessed . 
But our contempt was driven more by the West &apos;s role in supporting corruption in Africa than by the fate of the specific Zimbabwean artifact we had seen . 
It wasn &apos;t until I heard that Yale had returned the Peruvian objects that I began to think about African artifacts as culturally and historically important . 
Many African artifacts have , of course , ended up in Western museums or in the hands of private Western collectors . 
The pieces are largely the loot that Europeans pillaged from Africa during the slave trade and the colonial period . 
Perhaps the most famous is the sculpture known as Bangwa Queen . 
Valued at millions of dollars , it is the world &apos;s most expensive piece of African art . 
African art exhibitions usually include stories about each piece &apos;s origins , which are often tied to an African kingdom . 
But information about an artifact &apos;s journey to the West is often vague or nonexistent . 
For example , The New York Times published an article last year about an African art exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum . 
The Times reported that the Bangwa Queen has been owned by many famous collectors &quot; since she left her Cameroonian royal shrine in the late nineteenth century . &quot; 
In fact , the Bangwa Queen &quot; left &quot; Cameroon with Gustav Conrau , a German colonial explorer who later gave the statue to a museum in his home country . 
Considering the suspect tactics that colonial agents typically used to separate Africans from their possessions , it is unlikely that the Bangwa Queen left willingly . 
African artifacts on display in New York , London , Paris , and elsewhere have similar stories . 
Peru &apos;s reclamation of its cultural heritage made me wish the same for Africa &apos;s looted artifacts . 
But Peru is fundamentally different from any African country . 
Its demand reflected a reverence for its past . 
To Peruvians , the artifacts are a reminder of the great Inca civilization that European conquerors destroyed . 
Africans , on the other hand , tend to discount their past . 
To some extent , Africans appear to have internalized the condescending colonialist idea that Africa was primitive and needed to be civilized . 
We don &apos;t treasure our historical artifacts , because they remind us of our rich civilizations &quot; supposed inferiority . 
It is no wonder that an object as culturally important as a royal wedding skirt can be smuggled out of a country without anyone noticing . 
Until Africans recognize the value of their history , their cultures &quot; artistic output will continue to be up for grabs .
