Paris and the Fate of the Earth 
PRINCETON - The lives of billions of people , for centuries to come , will be at stake when world leaders and government negotiators meet at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris at the end of the month . 
The fate of an unknown number of endangered species of plants and animals also hangs in the balance . 
At the &quot; Earth Summit &quot; in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , 189 countries , including the United States , China , India , and all European countries signed on to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) , and agreed to stabilize greenhouse-gas emissions &quot; at a low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system . &quot; 
So far , however , no such stabilization has taken place , and without it , climate feedback loops could boost rising temperatures further still . 
With less Arctic ice to reflect sunlight , the oceans will absorb more warmth . 
Thawing Siberian permafrost will release vast quantities of methane . 
As a result , vast areas of our planet , currently home to billions of people , could become uninhabitable . 
Earlier conferences of the UNFCCC signatories sought to reach legally binding agreements on emission reductions , at least for the industrialized countries that have produced most of the greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere . 
That strategy faltered - partly owing to US intransigence under President George W. Bush - and was abandoned when the 2009 Copenhagen conference failed to produce a treaty to replace the expiring Kyoto Protocol ( which the US never signed ) . 
Instead , the Copenhagen Accord merely asked countries for voluntary pledges to cut their emissions by specific amounts . 
Those pledges have now come in , from 154 countries , including the major emitters , and they fall far short of what is required . 
To fathom the gap between what the pledges would achieve and what is required , we need to go back to the language that everyone accepted in Rio . 
The wording was vague in two key respects . 
First , what would constitute &quot; dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system &quot; ? 
And , second , what level of safety is assumed by the term &quot; prevent &quot; ? 
The first ambiguity has been resolved by the decision to aim for a level of emissions that would cap the increase in average surface temperature at 2º Celsius above the pre-industrial level . 
Many scientists consider even a lower increase dangerous . 
Consider that even with a rise of only 0.8ºC so far , the planet has experienced record-high temperatures , more extreme weather events , and substantial melting of the Greenland ice sheet , which contains enough water to cause a seven-meter rise in sea levels . 
In Copenhagen , the pleas of representatives of small island states ( some of which will cease to exist if sea levels continue to rise ) for a target of 1.5ºC went unheeded , essentially because world leaders thought the measures required to meet such a target were politically unrealistic . 
The second ambiguity remains . 
The London School of Economics &quot; Grantham Research Institute has analyzed the submissions made by all 154 countries and concluded that even if they are all implemented , global carbon emissions will rise from their current level of 50 billion tons per year to 55-60 billion tons by 2030 . 
But , to have even a 50 % chance of keeping to the 2ºC limit , annual carbon emissions need to come down to 36 billion tons . 
A report from Australia &apos;s National Centre for Climate Restoration is no less alarming . 
Imagine if an airline slashed its maintenance procedures to a level at which there was a 10 % chance that its planes would not safely complete their flights . 
The company could not claim that it had prevented dangerous planes from flying , and it would find few customers , even if its flights were much cheaper than anyone else &apos;s . 
Similarly , given the scale of the catastrophe that could result from &quot; dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system , &quot; we ought not to accept a 10 % chance - if not many times higher - of exceeding 2ºC . 
What is the alternative ? 
Developing countries will argue that their need for cheap energy to lift their people out of poverty is greater than rich countries &quot; need to maintain their often wasteful levels of energy consumption - and they will be right . 
That is why rich countries should aim at decarbonizing their economies as soon as possible , and by 2050 at the latest . 
They could start by closing down the dirtiest form of energy production , coal-fired power stations , and refuse licenses to develop new coal mines . 
Another quick gain could come from encouraging people to eat more plant-based foods , perhaps by taxing meat and using the revenue to subsidize more sustainable alternatives . 
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization , the livestock industry is the second largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions , ahead of the entire transport sector . 
This implies great scope for emission reductions , and in ways that would have a smaller impact on our lives than ceasing all fossil-fuel use . 
Indeed , according to a recent World Health Organization report , a reduction in the consumption of processed and red meat would have the additional benefit of reducing cancer deaths . 
These proposals may sound unrealistic . 
Anything less , however , would be a crime against billions of people , living and yet to be born , and against the entire natural environment of our planet .
