Will Global Imbalances Return ? 
BEIJING - Future history books , depending on where they are written , will take one of two approaches to assigning blame for the world &apos;s current financial and economic crisis . 
One approach will blame lax regulation , accommodating monetary policy , and inadequate savings in the United States . 
The other , already being pushed by former and current US officials like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke , will blame the immense pool of liquidity generated by high-savings countries in East Asia and the Middle East . 
All that liquidity , they will argue , had to go somewhere . Its logical destination was the country with the deepest financial markets , the US , where it raised asset prices to unsustainable heights . 
Note the one thing on which members of both camps agree : the global savings imbalance - low savings in the US and high savings in China and other emerging markets - played a key role in the crisis by allowing Americans to live beyond their means . 
It encouraged financiers desperate to earn a return on abundant funds to put them to more speculative use . 
If there is a consensus on one issue , it is the impossibility of understanding the bubble and the crash without considering the role of global imbalances . 
Preventing future crises similar to this one therefore requires resolving the problem of global imbalances . 
Here , the early signs are reassuring . 
American households are saving again . 
The US trade deficit has declined from $ 60 billion a month to just $ 26 billion , according to the most recent data . 
As a matter of simple arithmetic , we know that the rest of the world is running correspondingly smaller surpluses . 
But once American households rebuild their retirement accounts , they may return to their profligate ways . 
Indeed , the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve are doing all they can to pump up US spending . 
The only reason the US trade deficit is falling is that the country remains in a severe recession , causing US imports and exports to collapse in parallel . 
With recovery , both may recover to previous levels , and the 6 % -of-GDP US external deficit will be back . 
In fact , there has been no change in relative prices or depreciation of the US dollar of a magnitude that would augur a permanent shift in trade and spending patterns . 
Whether there is a permanent reduction in global imbalances will depend mainly on decisions taken outside the US , specifically in countries like China . 
One &apos;s forecast of those decisions hinges , in turn , on why these other countries came to run such large surpluses in the first place . 
One view is that their surpluses were a corollary of the policies favoring export-led growth that worked so well for so long . China &apos;s leaders are understandably reluctant to abandon a tried-and-true model . 
They can &apos;t restructure their economy instantaneously . 
They can &apos;t move workers from painting children &apos;s toys in Guangdong to building schools in Western China overnight . 
They need time to build a social safety net capable of encouraging Chinese households to reduce their precautionary saving . 
If this view is correct , we can expect to see global imbalances re-emerge once the recession is over and to unwind only slowly thereafter . 
The other view is that China contributed to global imbalances not through its merchandise exports , but through its capital exports . 
What China lacked was not demand for consumption goods , but a supply of high-quality financial assets . 
It found these in the US , mainly in the form Treasury and other government-backed securities , in turn pushing other investors into more speculative investments . 
Recent events have not enhanced the stature of the US as a supplier of high-quality assets . 
And China , for its part , will continue to develop its financial markets and its capacity to generate high-quality financial assets internally . 
But doing so will take time . 
Meanwhile , the US still has the most liquid financial markets in the world . 
This interpretation again implies the re-emergence of global imbalances once the recession ends , and their very gradual unwinding thereafter . 
One development that could change this forecast is if China comes to view investing in US financial assets as a money-losing proposition . 
US budget deficits as far as the eye can see might excite fear of losses on US Treasury bonds . 
A de facto policy of inflating away the debt might stoke such fears further . 
At that point , China would pull the plug , the dollar would crash , and the Fed would be forced to raise interest rates , plunging the US back into recession . 
There are two hopes for avoiding this disastrous outcome . 
One is relying on Chinese goodwill to stabilize the US and world economies . 
The other is for the Obama administration and the Fed to provide details about how they will eliminate the budget deficit and avoid inflation once the recession ends . 
The second option is clearly preferable . 
After all , it is always better to control one &apos;s own fate .
