Blood Quest 
WASHINGTON , DC - In most developed countries , patients can be confident about the safety of blood transfusions . 
Is it possible to ensure an adequate supply of safe blood once and for all ? 
Today &apos;s blood supplies , often donated by volunteers , can be contaminated with HIV and other infectious agents . 
And donor blood must be kept in cold storage , where it has a 28-day shelf life . 
Given fear of contamination - and military interest in a more durable supply - research into synthetic alternatives has long been a medical priority . 
The idea of using blood substitutes was first advanced in the seventeenth century , and continues to attract researchers today . 
Several products that could revolutionize transfusion medicine have already been developed in the pursuit of shelf-stable , portable , one-type-fits-all blood substitutes , which could replace standard blood transfusions in extreme situations , such as on the battlefield . 
But , after more than three decades of active research and development , no clinically viable product has obtained regulatory approval , owing to the significant scientific challenges . 
Blood is a complicated stew of plasma proteins , red blood cells , platelets , and other cellular components . 
These elements perform crucial functions , such as transporting oxygen , nutrients , and immunoglobulins ( which defend against infection ) , and regulating water content , temperature , and pH level . 
In the early twentieth century , researchers began to examine hemoglobin - the protein responsible for carrying oxygen from the respiratory organs to the rest of the body - in red blood cells . 
( Non-hemoglobin synthetic blood substitutes , known as fluorocarbons , have proved to be less effective oxygen carriers . ) 
But free hemoglobin can wreak havoc in the human body , causing hypertension , cardiac arrest , or even death . 
Indeed , in almost all living creatures , hemoglobin is encapsulated in red blood cells , which protect the body from the protein &apos;s negative effects ( and , in turn , protect hemoglobin from the body &apos;s digestive enzymes ) . 
Experts nonetheless believe that hemoglobin-based products can be used to save the lives of trauma patients , as well as to treat patients who object to donated blood on religious grounds ( for example , Jehovah &apos;s Witnesses ) . 
Hemoglobin contains hemes , chemical compounds that contain iron - a transition metal that can undergo oxidation , or &quot; rusting &quot; processes . 
Outside of red blood cells , &quot; good &quot; ferrous iron - the only oxygen-carrying form - is oxidized uncontrollably to form the &quot; bad &quot; ferric and &quot; ugly &quot; ferryl forms of hemoglobin . 
When released into a person &apos;s circulatory system , hemoglobin in these higher oxidation states eventually self-destructs , damaging molecules in surrounding tissue . 
Given that these mischievous forms of hemoglobin are difficult to study in living systems , researchers have largely ignored them . 
Instead , they have focused on strategies for preventing the kidneys from filtering the infused hemoglobin ; the hemoglobin from leaking through the blood-vessel walls ; and synthetic hemoglobin from destroying nitric oxide ( a gas produced in blood vessels that helps them to dilate and increase blood flow ) . 
Some researchers consider the reaction with nitric oxide the most problematic , because it raises blood pressure . 
But progress has been made in finding ways to control these oxidation reactions . 
Researchers ( including at my laboratory ) have investigated how the body naturally handles the occasional release of hemoglobin from aging red blood cells and from cells affected by blood diseases , such as hemolytic anemia . 
They have found that the body &apos;s first line of defense against hemoglobin oxidation is a process of reduction , in which molecules like uric acid or ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) impede oxidation by reducing the iron to a less oxidizing species . 
Moreover , a host of blood proteins are specialized scavengers of hemoglobin or its fragments . 
They reduce its toxicity and safely clear it for further processing within specialized cells called macrophages . 
For example , haptoglobin tightly binds to hemoglobin subunits , while hemopexin captures the heme when the hemoglobin releases it . 
Some recent therapeutic possibilities include the co-infusion of haptoglobin with hemoglobin in circulation or with vitamin C - additives that hold promising implications for the development of safe and effective blood substitutes . 
Researchers must build on this progress . 
Safe blood substitutes and new therapeutic options that make blood transfusion more effective would significantly improve treatment in challenging situations .
