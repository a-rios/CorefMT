The Pirates of Starvation 
NEW YORK - Time is running out for Somalia . 
As many as three million people - one-third of the country - live under threat of starvation . 
Their lifeline is the sea , from which food , medical supplies , and other aid arrives . 
And there lies the problem . 
Heavily armed bands of modern-day pirates in speedboats are terrorizing ships in Somalia &apos;s coastal waters . 
So far this year they have raided more than 50 vessels , stealing cargos and hijacking ships , from private yachts to oil tankers , and extorting some $ 100 million a year in ransom . 
Just last week , a Ukrainian freighter carrying heavy weaponry , including tanks , was hijacked . 
A Greek petrochemical carrier was seized , and another attacked , as was an Iranian oil tanker . 
These pirates currently hold more than a dozen ships hostage in Somali ports . 
Ships laden with tens of thousands of tons of maize , sorghum , split peas , and cooking oil from the United Nations World Food Program and other international aid organizations must navigate these dangerous waters . 
Keeping Somalia &apos;s sea-borne supply line open is imperative . 
These pirate terrorists are not particularly powerful . 
Estimates put their number at around 1,200 . 
Since November 2007 , following a series of pirate raids , Canada , the Netherlands , Denmark , and France deployed naval frigates to escort WFP aid ships safely into harbor . 
Under their protection , not a single ship has come under attack , ensuring the uninterrupted flow of assistance . 
Yet despite that clear success , the future is uncertain . 
The Canadian naval mission ends in late October , and no country has stepped forward to replace it . 
Without naval escorts , food aid will not get to Somalia . 
The WFP has stockpiled sufficient supplies to keep relief flowing for some days . 
I am optimistic that some nation will come to the rescue - but we must not risk this happening too late , or not at all . 
Beyond that , we need a long-term plan . 
We at the UN are duty-bound to do what compassion and human decency demand of us . 
Is the world really going to stand by and watch more children die of starvation ? 
Somalia &apos;s political future is uncertain at best . 
Yet we need to set to work on a plan for deploying a viable multinational force to help secure peace there , or at the very least sustain its people . 
There is a clear way to begin . 
The first step is for some country or countries to volunteer the naval force needed to preserve Somalia &apos;s humanitarian lifeline . 
The next is to develop a comprehensive strategy , in conjunction with the UN Security Council , to eliminate piracy in Somali waters . 
The time to act is now . 
Lives depend on it .
