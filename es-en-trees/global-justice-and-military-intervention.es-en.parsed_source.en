Global Justice and Military Intervention 
MELBOURNE - The world has watched in horror as Libya &apos;s Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi uses his military to attack protesters opposed to his rule , killing hundreds or possibly thousands of unarmed civilians . 
Many of his own men have refused to fire on their own people , instead defecting to the rebels or flying their planes to nearby Malta , so Qaddafi has called in mercenaries from neighboring countries who are more willing to obey his orders . 
World leaders were quick to condemn Qaddafi &apos;s actions . 
On February 26 , the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to impose an arms embargo on Libya , urge member nations to freeze assets owned by Qaddafi and his family , and refer the regime &apos;s violence to the International Criminal Court for possible prosecution of those responsible . 
This is the first time that the Security Council has unanimously referred a situation involving human rights violations to the International Criminal Court , and it is remarkable that countries that are not members of the Court - including the United States , Russia , and China - nevertheless supported the referral . 
The resolution can thus be seen as another incremental step towards the establishment of a global system of justice able to punish those who commit gross violations of human rights , regardless of their political or legal status in their own country . 
Yet , in another way , the Security Council resolution was a disappointment . 
The situation in Libya became a test of how seriously the international community takes the idea of a responsibility to protect people from their rulers . 
The idea is an old one , but its modern form is rooted in the tragic failure to intervene in the Rwandan genocide in 1994 . 
A subsequent UN inquiry concluded that as few as 2,500 properly trained military personnel could have prevented the massacre of 800,000 Tutsis . 
Former US President Bill Clinton has said that the mistake he most regrets making during his presidency was his failure to push for intervention in Rwanda . 
Kofi Annan , who was then UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace-Keeping Operations , described the situation at the UN at the time as a &quot; terrible and humiliating &quot; paralysis . 
When Annan became Secretary-General , he urged the development of principles that would indicate when it is justifiable for the international community to intervene to prevent gross violations of human rights . 
In response , Canada &apos;s government established an International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty , which recommended that military intervention could be justified , as an extraordinary measure , where large-scale loss of life is occurring or imminent , owing to deliberate state action or the state &apos;s refusal or failure to act . 
These principles were endorsed by the UN General Assembly at its special World Summit in 2005 and discussed again in 2009 , with an overwhelming majority of states supporting them . 
The principle fits the situation in Libya today . 
Yet the Security Council resolution contains no mention of the possibility of military intervention - not even the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent Qaddafi from using planes to attack protesters . 
One body with a special concern to transform the idea of the responsibility to protect into a cause for action is the Global Center for the Responsibility to Protect , at the City University of New York . 
It has called on UN members to uphold their 2005 commitments and put the responsibility to protect into action in Libya . 
It urges consideration of a range of measures , several of which were covered by the Security Council resolution , but also including a no-fly zone . 
In addition to arguing that the responsibility to protect can justify military intervention , the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty recommended a set of precautionary principles . 
For example , military intervention should be a last resort , and the consequences of action should not be likely to be worse than the consequences of inaction . 
Whether these precautionary principles are satisfied in Libya requires expert judgment of the specifics of the situation . 
No one wants another drawn-out war like those in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Assuming that foreign military forces rapidly overwhelmed Qaddafi &apos;s troops , they would soon be able to withdraw and leave the Libyan people to decide their own future . 
At the time of writing , it is arguable that other sanctions or threats , short of military intervention , would be sufficient to deter more widespread bloodshed . 
Perhaps the rebels and the sanctions can overthrow Qaddafi unaided , without great loss of life . 
It is also unclear whether military intervention would cause more deaths than it prevented . 
But these are questions that the international community needs to ask , and that the Security Council should have been discussing , so that the principle of the responsibility to protect - and its possible implications for military action - become part of our understanding of the requirements of international law and global ethics .
