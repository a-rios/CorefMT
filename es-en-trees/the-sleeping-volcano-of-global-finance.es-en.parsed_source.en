The Sleeping Volcano of Global Finance 
The rejection of the European Union &apos;s Constitutional Treaty by French and Dutch voters was , according to all evidence , more a rejection of unregulated globalization than it was a rejection of Europe . 
The general instability of social relations - most importantly , but not only , of employment - is slowly becoming intolerable for a growing part of the population in many developed countries , not just in Europe . 
And there cannot be a stable economic order - at least not in democratic countries - if electorates reject its underpinnings . 
Capitalism could be reconstructed after World War II because it was buttressed by three necessary types of regulation : social security , which served as a principal stabilizer , at least in the developed countries ; 
But the realignment of the rich , developed countries around the monetarist policies promoted by economists like Milton Friedman , which began around 1970 , broke with all that . 
Not long after , the dollar was detached from the gold standard . 
Ever since , the international financial system has endured almost constant instability . 
Crises have multiplied , with each seemingly worse than the one that came before . 
Throughout the rich world , poverty has come roaring back . 
Internal and international inequalities have been increasing at breakneck speed . 
Employment is increasingly precariousness . 
And where unemployment is preferred to universal job insecurity , it has become impossible to suppress . 
It is to this state of affairs that the French and Dutch said &quot; no &quot; two months ago . 
Paradoxically , however , a united Europe is likely to be needed even more in the near future than it was in the past . 
After all , beyond the social misery produced by the re-institutionalized cruelty of the current global economic system , the greatest danger facing the world nowadays is that very system &apos;s inherent instability . 
I don &apos;t see any institution other than the EU that has enough size and heft to protect Europeans from a possible implosion . 
Consider the simple fact that the American economy is now more than $ 600 billion in debt . 
The United States cannot function without being able to borrow $ 1.9 billion dollars each and every day of the year , mainly from the emerging economies of Asia , and China above all . 
But this support could weaken or even cease if the dollar falls too low , if the price of oil rises too high , or if the American economy backfires . 
In fact , the US economy has become increasingly detached from reality . 
Its manufacturing sector now accounts for a mere 11 % of America &apos;s GDP . 
Ford and General Motors are in dire financial straits . 
Meanwhile , two speculative bubbles - in the real estate market and in mortgages - have become grafted upon each other and now dominate economic activity in the US . 
A crash , or at least a sharp spasm , is quite likely in the near future , and the consequences - for America and the world - may be catastrophic . 
This instability also makes it difficult to address other grave problems affecting the global financial system . 
Sovereign debt , needed by all countries , but particularly by the poorest , suffers profoundly from erratic interest-rate and exchange-rate movements . 
The absence of a lender of last resort in today &apos;s world only magnifies the threat involved in each crisis . 
To make matters worse , national failures can no longer be addressed without aggravating the situation . 
Of course - indeed , above all - in such circumstances the immense investments needed to overcome underdevelopment and the disabilities that it entails are increasingly forgotten by the world of international finance . 
With rich countries threatened by instability and poor countries largely left to their own devices , the reconstruction of the world financial system should be at the top of the international agenda . 
A new Bretton Woods could not be more urgent !
