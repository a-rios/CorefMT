The Distributional Challenge 
MILAN - Assessing the recent past and looking forward to the near term is a natural end-of-year exercise . 
When it comes to the global economy in 2013 and 2014 , it may well be a necessary one as well . 
In the past year , systemic risk declined . 
Europe came together around the need to stabilize the eurozone , with the European Central Bank and Germany playing the leading roles . 
China &apos;s leadership transition was completed and a relatively clear policy direction has been established , featuring a more level playing field for the private and state sectors and an expanding - indeed &quot; decisive &quot; - role for markets . 
Germany &apos;s general election pointed to policy continuity , though an extended period of slow growth and high unemployment seems unavoidable . 
Emerging economies ( excluding China ) were only temporarily destabilized by anticipation of monetary tightening in the United States . 
They are , however , preparing for a higher-interest-rate world , one marked by a transitional slowdown in growth . 
In the US , the annual growth rate crept up and unemployment inched down . 
Widespread public disgust with a polarized , dysfunctional Congress may have contributed to a bipartisan budget agreement and a reduction in political risk . 
Though it would be premature to announce a trend , one can hope that pragmatism and compromise will prevail over the moral righteousness of political extremes . 
No one likes living with second- or third-best alternatives , but that is America &apos;s reality for now . 
Looking forward , one can foresee a gradual process of restoring balance sheets and balanced growth patterns in a wide range of economies . 
But this does not amount to a full recovery . 
In Europe , more convergence in unit labor costs and reforms targeting structural adaptability remain on the to-do list . 
In the US , persistent underinvestment in the public sector is the main factor blocking full realization of potential growth . 
A recent proposal by the economist Martin Feldstein points in the right direction : funding expanded public-sector investment with a short- to medium-term fiscal stimulus in conjunction with a multi-year fiscal-consolidation plan . 
Whether the new spirit of bipartisanship extends that far remains to be seen ; clearly , the political challenge of making credible multi-year commitments remains daunting . 
But , while cautious optimism may be in order , many advanced and developing countries &quot; growth patterns - both before and since the 2008 crisis - have underpinned a dramatic shift in income and wealth toward the upper quartile of the distribution . 
This is not only producing high and rising levels of measured income inequality ; it may also be contributing to reduced economic and social mobility and greater inequality of opportunity - arguably an even more serious threat to social cohesion and political stability . 
We know some of the causes of these trends . 
In the US , for example , labor-saving technology is reducing routine white- and blue-collar employment across the economy , pushing employment toward non-routine manual or cognitive activities . 
This has undoubtedly contributed to downward pressure on household earnings in the middle-income range of the economy &apos;s large non-tradable side . 
On the tradable side , automation and the shift of middle-range jobs ( in terms of value added ) to developing countries have caused employment growth to stall , while value added per person and average incomes have grown rapidly . 
America &apos;s uneven education system - in which quality is correlated with neighborhood income levels and skills training is out of synch with employers &quot; rapidly evolving needs - is a second factor fueling higher inequality . 
This reflects both a public-investment deficiency and an information gap : investing in job training in a rapidly evolving industrial structure is like shooting at a moving target . 
Given imperfect information about future needs , labor markets are out of equilibrium . 
Powerful technological and global market forces are not confined to any single country . 
The same issues are arising everywhere , with differences in outcomes reflecting variability in market flexibility and social-policy choices . 
These adverse trends date back to about 1980 . 
Before that , the post-war pattern of growth showed a much lower divergence between mean and median incomes than many economies are now experiencing . 
Nor are these trends likely to diminish in the near future . 
Ameliorating unfavorable distributional outcomes will inevitably involve either direct market intervention ( using , for example , minimum-wage and trade policies ) or altering incentives ( relying on unemployment insurance and redistribution through the tax system or direct provision of services ) . 
Because opportunity is still related to growth , the challenge is to experiment with and design multipronged approaches that achieve , or at least advance , distributional objectives while doing minimal damage to the economy &apos;s structural flexibility and dynamic efficiency . 
And here , the perfect must not be allowed to become the enemy of the good . 
Most countries attempt to address distributional problems by combining social provision of basic services ( like education , skills training , and health care ) with a minimum wage , progressive income taxation , and property taxes ( which mitigate adverse incentives associated with high marginal income-tax rates ) . 
In some countries , broadly shared restraint on income and wage growth seems to have been important to restoring competitiveness and boosting potential output . 
There are also measures that partly protect domestic tradable industries from external competition , or , in the case of the exchange rate and management of the capital account , that alter the terms of trade . 
Of course , international agreements limit such measures in order to preserve a relatively open global economy , which yields large aggregate benefits ( even as the distribution of benefits and costs remains a challenge for policymakers ) . 
And all of these measures have implications for economies &quot; efficiency and adaptability . 
At the end of 2013 , one of our age &apos;s great political leaders and campaigners for social and economic justice , Nelson Mandela , passed from our midst . 
The pursuit of sustainable patterns of equitable and inclusive growth will be a defining feature of economic policymaking worldwide in 2014 and beyond . 
We must hope that business and labor leaders can come together with government , educational establishments , and social entrepreneurs to advance this agenda . 
Mandela &apos;s example and generosity of spirit should be our guide .
