Autumn of the Patriarchs 
MADRID - &quot; How difficult it is to die ! &quot; 
Death , it seems , is always particularly difficult for autocrats to manage , even when they succeed in dying of natural causes . 
A dictator &apos;s death throes are always a form of theater , featuring ecstatic masses , would-be successors fighting for political survival , and , behind the scenes , the dictator &apos;s coterie locked in efforts to extend the life of their patriarch until they can secure their privileges . 
Franco &apos;s son-in-law , who was also the family doctor , kept the dying despot on life-support machines for more than a month . 
It is not exactly clear how long Venezuela &apos;s Hugo Chávez was actually dead before his passing was officially announced . 
Buying time to secure their own political future , Venezuelan officials carefully stage-managed Chávez &apos;s illness and eventual death , even suggesting near the end , while he was undergoing complex and agonizing cancer treatments , that he was still &quot; walking and exercising . &quot; 
The information vacuum was reminiscent of the secrecy surrounding the deaths of Stalin and Mao , and the practice in the Ottoman empire of keeping the sultan &apos;s death a secret for weeks until the succession was settled . 
The emotional manipulation of the mise-en-scene surrounding Chávez &apos;s death appears certain to translate into electoral support for his grey successor , Nicolás Maduro . 
In Argentina , despite the disaster of Juan Perón &apos;s return to power in 1973 , after an 18-year exile , Perónism was reincarnated in the 1980 &quot; s in the presidency of Carlos Saúl Menem , and again with the arrival of President Néstor Kirchner and , later , his wife , current President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner . 
Fernández &apos;s melodramatic speeches are a transparent attempt to elevate her late husband to saintly status , just as Perón elevated his wife , Evita , to sainthood . 
Upon taking office , she swore allegiance not only to the constitution , but to &quot; Him &quot; ( Kirchner ) as well . 
Unlike mere mortals , dictators do have a good chance of enjoying an afterlife . 
In ancient Egypt , deceased Pharaohs were embalmed and deified . 
After Augustus , the first Roman princeps , the Senate could vote deceased emperors into divine status . 
Such an apotheosis , of course , served the political interests of the emperor &apos;s successors , who could claim a godly lineage while aspiring to be raised to godlike status themselves . 
Chávez excelled in ridiculing his political enemies , but he was too much of a narcissist to approach the end with the kind of humor that , according to Suetonius , inspired Emperor Vespasian &apos;s deathbed quip : &quot; Oh dear , I must be turning into a God . &quot; 
The grotesque idea of embalming Chávez &apos;s body was finally discarded precisely because of the damage suffered by the corpse during its display to the masses in a chaotic exercise in political manipulation . 
A god , certainly not , but a saint , perhaps . 
Indeed , what was good enough for &quot; Santa Evita , &quot; as the Argentine writer Tomás Eloy Martínez called her , might be good enough for Chávez . 
Like the dying tyrant in Gabriel García Márquez &apos;s The Autumn of the Patriarch , who righteously lamented the fate that would befall the poor after his passing , Chávez will remain for years to come the saintly benefactor , martyr , and redeemer of the destitute in the eyes of the Venezuelan masses . 
Indeed , he is likely to achieve the kind of immortality that he always believed he deserved . 
Part of the legend is almost invariably the mystery surrounding the circumstances of the leader &apos;s death . 
An ordinary , natural death does not accord with the superhero image of the patriarch fighting the nation &apos;s enemies . 
Maduro &apos;s conspiracy theory that his mentor &apos;s cancer was the result of poisoning by &quot; the dark forces that wanted him out of the way &quot; is not particularly original , though it does raise the stakes . 
Chávez himself always maintained that his idol , Simón Bolívar , was poisoned by his enemies in Colombia in 1830 . 
History , more imaginary than real , offers Maduro a score of additional examples . 
Was Napoleon slowly poisoned by arsenic during his exile in St. Helena ? 
Did Lenin die of syphilis , a massive stroke , or poisoning by Stalin ? 
Given the bizarre circumstances of Stalin &apos;s own death , was he poisoned by his secret police chief , Lavrentiy Beria , or perhaps by his archenemy , Yugoslavia &apos;s Josip Broz Tito ? 
Did &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong-il suffer a heart attack in bed , or , more nobly , on a train trip while working for the welfare of his beloved people ? 
Allegations of poisoning by the wicked imperialists are , of course , a feature of the official Kim death story . 
Maduro himself invoked the rumor that the Israelis poisoned former Palestinian President Yasser Arafat . 
He could just as well refer to Egypt &apos;s Gamal Abdel Nasser , who dropped dead of a heart attack in 1970 ; 
Nasser &apos;s confidant , the journalist Mohamed Hassanein Heikal , always maintained that the president had been poisoned by his deputy and successor , Anwar El Sadat . 
Although Chávez &apos;s legend may survive , Chávismo probably will not , for it is not truly a doctrine , but a sentiment based on the rejection of the old political order and the invention of enemies . 
It lacks the solid foundations of , say , Perónism , an inclusive movement that relied on a traditionally well-organized working class and a nationalistic bourgeoisie . Chávismo , apart from its reliance on charismatic leadership , has never amounted to more than a social program hitched to an oil bonanza .
