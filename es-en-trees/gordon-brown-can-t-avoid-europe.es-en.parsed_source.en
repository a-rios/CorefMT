Gordon Brown Can \ u0027t Avoid Europe 
Tony Blair &apos;s troubles are not confined to overwhelming public skepticism regarding the war in Iraq . 
The strong economy that has buttressed his government since 1997 is showing cracks . 
Indeed , until now , Europe &apos;s worries about public finance have centered on Germany , France , and Portugal . 
Britain seemed a paragon of fiscal prudence . 
In his forthcoming budget , however , Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown may need to admit that the UK risks breaching the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s deficit limits . 
Before Britain &apos;s next election , an even more worrying admission may be forced on Chancellor Brown : the need to raise taxes to meet his own fiscal rules . 
Last November , Chancellor Brown forecast that the UK &apos;s budget deficit would rise to £ 24 billion in 2003 / 4 , then fall to £ 19 billion by 2004 / 5-well below the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s ceiling of 3 % of GDP . 
But the average forecast among analysts is a £ 27 billion deficit next year , and some observers project a deficit of £ 30 billion or more in 2004 / 05 . 
This will press hard against the Maastricht ceiling . 
Two issues are at stake here . 
One concerns growth . 
In November , Brown forecast that UK GDP would grow by 2.5-3 % in 2003 / 4 , accelerating to 3-3.5 % the following year . 
But independent forecasters disagree here , too . 
They expect growth of only 2.2 % this year and 2.4 % next year . 
But the more critical issue concerns Brown &apos;s assumption that the tax / GDP ratio will rise in coming years . 
There are many reasons why this won &apos;t happen , the most powerful being the end of Britain &apos;s equity boom and the consequent loss of revenue from taxes on the sale of stocks . 
Moreover , UK pension funds are reporting large deficits due to the collapsing value of their equity holdings . 
This casts doubt on the UK &apos;s &quot; solution &quot; to the problem of pension sustainability , which had given the UK immunity from criticism by the European Commission for budget over-runs . 
Since coming to power in 1997 , Brown has trumpeted two strict fiscal &quot; rules &quot; : 
· The &quot; Sustainable Investment Rule &quot; states that over the economic cycle , the ratio of net public-sector debt to GDP will be set at a &quot; stable and prudent &quot; level-40 % of GDP . 
With net public-sector debt forecast to remain at or below 33 % of GDP for the foreseeable future , this rule will most likely be comfortably met ; 
· The &quot; Golden Rule &quot; states that over the course of an economic cycle , government can borrow only to invest and not to finance current spending . 
One difference between the Golden Rule and the Stability Pact is that investment expenditure is excluded from Brown &apos;s Golden Rule , which is assessed only on the basis of &quot; current &quot; spending . 
Another is that the Golden Rule applies to fiscal policy across the whole economic cycle , not to any given year , so that cyclical deterioration can be distinguished from structural weakening . 
One consequence of this is that any conclusion about whether the Golden Rule has been met can only be reached with hindsight , after an economic cycle is completed . 
Brown &apos;s Treasury estimates that the current economic cycle began in 1999-2000 , when output last started growing above trend . 
Growth is forecast to return above trend by 2005-06 , bringing the current cycle to an end . 
The average surplus on the &quot; current &quot; budget since this cycle began is 0.8 % of GDP . 
Huge surpluses in the three years since 1999 far outweigh the official deficits forecast in the next two years . 
This means that the Treasury expects the average surplus since 1999 / 2000 to stabilize at 0.7 % of GDP until the cycle ends , allowing Brown &apos;s strictures to be met . 
But independent forecasters are more pessimistic . 
Some project that the cumulative deficit over the next four years will be £ 26 billion higher than the Treasury predicts . 
The most pessimistic foresee a cumulative overshoot of £ 61 billion . 
All are based mainly on predicted shortfalls in revenue and excessive current spending , rather than increases in investment spending over and above the Chancellor &apos;s ambitious plans . 
So they are highly pertinent to the question of whether the Golden Rule can be met . 
The independent Institute of Fiscal Studies calculates that the Chancellor could run cumulative current deficits of nearly £ 50 billion between now and the end of the cycle in 2005 / 06 without breaking the Golden Rule , rather than the £ 2.7 billion the Treasury currently projects . 
So only if the most pessimistic independent forecasts are accurate is it conceivable that the Chancellor will break his Golden Rule in this cycle . 
Moreover , the overshoot would have to be almost entirely in current , rather than investment , spending . 
But the Chancellor has so much room for maneuver in the next few years only because of the big surpluses he accumulated earlier in the cycle . 
The Government &apos;s tax and spending positions have changed mightily since then , so Brown cannot rely on similar surpluses at the equivalent stage of the next cycle . 
While the Golden Rule should be met for the current cycle , it seems likely to be violated in the future unless tax and spending plans are adjusted . 
So however much Brown wants to resist obeying European rules , he cannot long delay raising taxes ( or cutting spending ) without breaching his own Golden Rule and undermining his personal credibility . 
Brown need not take such measures in his forthcoming budget . 
But on current expectations , his policy will come under increasing scrutiny next year .
