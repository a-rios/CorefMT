Corruption and Liberalization 
Corruption is one of Africa &apos;s endemic problems . 
Indeed , it is a key issue in Nigeria &apos;s approaching presidential election , given President Obasanjo &apos;s high-minded but failed struggle to curb it . 
But the winds of globalization were supposed to blow away the cobwebs of bribery and inefficiency . 
Harvard political scientist Devesh Kapur suggests why this is not happening . 
Evict the state from direct economic activity , curb its discretionary powers , and both economic efficiency and governance will improve . 
Developing countries have been nagged about this for years . 
By opening economies to international competition and investment , governments will supposedly become disciplined because they will be watched over by international financial capital . 
There is undoubtedly merit in shrinking the size of government and making it less intrusive . 
Uganda is a case in point that this can bring early benefits . 
Yet official corruption has clearly not declined in the way liberalization &apos;s promoters said it would , nor has governance improved markedly for the better in most countries . 
Why ? 
First , opening an economy bids up the price of talent . 
In India a decade ago , students who chose careers in public service could expect lifetime earnings of between a fifth to a third of their private sector counterparts . 
Today , they get less than 10 % . 
The highest level civil servant or chief justice of the Supreme Court at the end of their careers is nowadays paid barely half the salary of graduates of India &apos;s elite educational institutions , who are snapped up by the global economy . 
Of course , talent should go where it is most productive , and higher private-sector wages reflect the potential for higher productivity . 
But the lure of high private-sector wages has consequences for the quality of government , as South Africa is discovering . 
Second , exposing the arrogance and venality of the state was no doubt necessary to enact liberal reforms . 
But these critiques became self-inflicted prophecies . 
Treating the state as a house of ill repute makes it difficult for governments to recruit honest , capable individuals . 
A well-educated person seeking a career in government can be seen not only as a fool , but as corrupt as well-hardly inspirational ! 
The quality of any organization , private or public , depends on the quality of the individuals it attracts . 
Third , although curtailing the state &apos;s role in allocating goods and services that can be provided more efficiently by markets may reduce corruption , it is unrealistic to think that the number of fields in which the state deploys its regulatory powers can be reduced greatly . 
In a modern economy the state is active in many non-economic areas , from food safety to building regulations . 
Although official corruption is greater when the state is involved in economic activities , shifting the focus of state regulation appears to change only the magnitude of corruption . 
The incidence of corruption could well increase . 
But the weakest assumption about the benefits of a small state centers around the pace at which institutions develop . 
The centrality of institutions in fostering &quot; good governance &quot; is underscored almost everywhere . 
Unfortunately , globalization / liberalization and institutional development often work at cross purposes because of their different time horizons . 
Indeed , the key factor distinguishing institutional development in the West from that in developing countries is time . 
The bedrock economic , social , and political institutions in Western societies took decades , if not centuries , to develop . 
Exceptions to this time frame exist-Singapore is one example-but exceptions prove a rule , they do not negate it . 
Institution building is painful and laborious ( &quot; a slow boring of hard boards , &quot; as Max Weber called it ) , as evidenced in the recurrent crises faced by African countries from Nigeria to Botswana . 
Globalization accelerates the pace of economic and social change in developing countries , which means that new institutions must adapt even before they fully take root . 
The temporal dimension of institution building and the issue of human capital are also linked . 
The reality of successful institution building is that key individuals are critical in the early stages , even if successful institutions may later make particular individuals less indispensable . 
But globalization makes it more difficult for developing countries to retain the talented individuals needed for institutional development , because the wages of talented people are set globally ; many states , if not most , simply can &apos;t afford to pay what it takes to create the institutions they need . 
In fact , data on emigration and inequality suggest that developing countries with lower levels of inequality are threatened by &quot; human capital flight , &quot; as thousands of their most talented people remain abroad after studying at elite universities-a bane across Africa . 
So poor countries must either suffer the loss of people essential to their institutional development or tolerate higher levels of inequality , with the political and economic consequences that follow . 
Some of these shortcomings may be improved by reducing the state even more through privatization and out-sourcing . 
States could , in theory , reinvent themselves as the political equivalent of Nike-minimizing in-house activities by contracting out ever more of their functions to providers in the global market . 
Such out-sourcing may be possible and , to some degree , necessary . 
But there are limits to this . 
As beguiling as the reforms now being promoted by international organizations sound , countries must be wary of taking short cuts in constructing their institutions . 
The path to good governance is more painstaking and bumpier than anyone believed when globalization and liberalization became popular twenty years ago . 
Mimicking simplistic fashions is only likely to make the path longer .
