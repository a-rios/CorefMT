Europe in Reverse 
BERLIN - The legendary American investor Warren Buffet once said , &quot; It &apos;s when the tide goes out that you find out who has been swimming naked . &quot; 
That particular piece of wisdom referred to the situation of companies in an economic crisis . 
But it can also be applied to countries and economies . 
In Europe , the situation is cause for growing concern , because the global economic crisis is relentlessly laying bare the European Union &apos;s flaws and limitations . 
Indeed , what Europe lost , first and foremost , with the rejection of the constitutional treaty is now obvious : its faith in itself and its common future . 
Amid this worst crisis since 1929 , America has opted for a truly new beginning with the election of Barack Obama , and is now in the process of reinventing itself . 
By contrast , each passing day seems to drive EU members further apart . 
Rather than reinventing itself , Europe , under the pressure of the crisis and its own internal contradictions , threatens to revert to the national egoism and protectionism of the past . 
Europe today has a common currency and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which have proven to be bulwarks in defending monetary stability during the financial crisis . 
Any weakening of these two institutions would cause severe damage to common European interests . 
But EU member governments &quot; behavior during the past few months raises grave doubts about whether they see things this way . 
The longer the crisis continues , the more obvious it becomes that the common currency and the ECB alone are not enough to defend the Common Market and European integration . 
Without common economic and financial policies , coordinated at least between the members of the euro zone , the cohesion of the common currency and the EU - indeed , their very existence - are in unprecedented danger . 
To be sure , the crisis has placed a stranglehold on countries worldwide . 
But there are significant differences and economic imbalances within the EU and the euro zone , reflected , for example , by increasingly divergent interest rates . 
Confidence in Italy , Spain , Ireland , Portugal , and Greece is rapidly evaporating , while the stronger economies in northern Europe are doing better , although they are struggling , too . 
Should this continue , perhaps bringing a de facto end to the Maastricht criteria and rising national protectionism in the form of industrial subsidies , the euro will be seriously jeopardized . 
It is easy to imagine what the euro &apos;s failure would mean for the EU as a whole : a disaster of historic proportions . 
Moreover , the new EU member states in Eastern Europe , which have neither the economic strength nor the political stability of long-term members , are now beginning to take a nosedive . 
Given the exposure of some euro-zone states such as Austria , this crisis will also affect the euro area directly . 
To wait and see is , therefore , the wrong strategy . 
There is no reason to believe that the current global economic crisis has bottomed out . 
So , assuming that it intensifies further , Europe will rapidly face a grim alternative : either the richer and more stable economies in the North - first and foremost Europe &apos;s largest economy , Germany - will use their greater financial resources to help the weaker euro-zone economies , or the euro will be endangered , and with it the whole project of European integration . 
Why not , then , quickly introduce new instruments such as Eurobonds , or create an EU mechanism comparable to the IMF ? 
Each would certainly be costly - particularly for Germany - and therefore would be anything but popular , but the alternatives are much costlier ; indeed , they are not serious political options . 
Institutionally , there is no way around a &quot; European economic government &quot; or &quot; enhanced economic coordination &quot; ( or whatever you want to call it ) , which in fact would be possible informally and thus without any treaty change . 
Unfortunately , it has become clear that the Franco-German engine , which is crucial to the EU acting in unison , is momentarily blocked . 
Their rhetoric suggests that France and Germany have a great deal in common , but the facts speak a completely different language . 
In nearly all strategic aspects of EU crisis management , Germany and France are blocking each other - although ironically , both are doing virtually the same thing . 
They are thinking first and foremost of themselves , not of Europe , which is thus effectively without leadership . 
The EU was and is institutionalized compromise , and must remain so now , in the midst of a global economic crisis . 
If Germany and France don &apos;t quickly resolve their differences and find a joint strategic answer to the crisis , they will damage themselves and Europe as a whole . 
It must never be forgotten that the EU is a project designed for mutual economic progress . 
If this economic bond disappears , national interests will reassert themselves and rip the project apart . 
Europe today does not lack economic strength , but rather the political will to act in unison . 
Here is where Germany and France must lead the way .
