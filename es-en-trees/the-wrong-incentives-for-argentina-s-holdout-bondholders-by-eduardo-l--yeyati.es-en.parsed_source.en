Argentina &apos;s Debt Conundrum 
BUENOS AIRES - Argentina is in a quandary . 
Prior to its 2005 sovereign-debt exchange , its legislature enacted a &quot; lock law , &quot; which barred the way to any future offers to holders of bonds on which Argentina defaulted in 2002 . 
While the lock law helped to boost the participation rate in the 2005 exchange , holdout creditors remained , and have pursued litigation to force repayment . 
In late November , Thomas Griesa , a United States federal judge in New York , ordered Argentina to deposit the $ 1.33 billion owed to holdouts into an escrow account by December 15 . 
Griesa lifted the stay on his order from February 2012 , following indications from Argentina &apos;s government that it intended to ignore the ruling - including public statements calling the holdouts &quot; vulture funds &quot; and a vow by President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner never to pay . 
The ruling , pending appeal , leaves Argentina with three options : violate its own law , violate US law , or default again . 
In his ruling , which was based on the pari passu ( &quot; equal footing &quot; ) clause included in the bonds , Griesa included the Bank of New York Mellon ( the bondholders &quot; trustee ) among entities that act &quot; in active concert and participation &quot; with Argentina , and cautioned it against transferring funds if Argentina ignores the order . 
As a result , if Argentina chooses to pay exchange bondholders as usual , BNY Mellon may refuse to transfer the funds , triggering a technical default . 
But time to search for loopholes is limited . 
While the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals has granted Argentina an emergency stay order , temporarily lifting the threat of default , Argentine officials will need to present their arguments before the court in February . 
But , beyond that point , Argentina &apos;s government may face a dilemma : By continuing to make payments , it would be committing to comply with a ruling that is widely viewed as excessive and unfair ; but refusing to pay would undermine the appeals process by exposing Argentina &apos;s unwillingness to abide by an adverse ruling . 
Indeed , the government &apos;s harsh rhetoric has given it little leeway . 
As in poker , it will have to pay to see the next card . 
But Argentina does have options . 
While the required escrow deposit is not an actual payment to holdouts , given that the guarantee would be recovered if the appeals court ultimately ruled in Argentina &apos;s favor , it could be considered a contingent payment in violation of the lock law . 
The government could easily avoid this by obtaining parliamentary agreement to suspend the law temporarily , as it did in 2010 , when a second sovereign-debt exchange was conducted . 
Indeed , reopening the exchange , an option already being assessed , remains a natural alternative to Griesa &apos;s maximalist interpretation of pari passu - though it may be too late to pursue this route . 
By contrast , refusing to comply with the ruling would likely inhibit BNY Mellon from executing the payments , making it virtually impossible to pay the warrant to exchange bondholders on time . 
According to the bonds &quot; collective action clause ( CAC ) , this would not amount to a default if 75 % of bondholders accepted the change of venue . 
To be sure , the bondholders might refuse , given that , if they individually declared the exchange bonds to be in default , they could demand in court immediate payment in full of the remaining debt . 
In the absence of a sovereign bankruptcy procedure , a coordinated solution - which debt exchanges and CACs are designed to facilitate - is the best option . 
After all , investors are more likely to reject a longer period of lower payments on exchange bonds if they can seek immediate and full retribution for the original debt . 
Indeed , not even the risk of receiving nothing ensures that bondholders will not revert to the old bonds . 
Unless Argentina puts forward an alternative payment proposal , the US Court of Appeals ( and , possibly , the US Supreme Court ) will have to choose between the holdouts &quot; &quot; all &quot; and Argentina &apos;s &quot; nothing . &quot; 
Suspending the lock law and reopening the exchange could provide a basis for revision of the case - and lead to a ruling that begins to fill the gaps in the international financial architecture . 
At a time when new sovereign-debt restructurings are distinct possibilities , such action is crucial .
