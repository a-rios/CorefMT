The Diseases of Globalization 
Globalization is under strain as never before . 
Everywhere its stresses rumble . 
Most of sub-Saharan Africa , South America , the Middle East , and Central Asia are mired in stagnation or economic decline . 
North America , Western Europe , and Japan are bogged down in slow growth and risk renewed recession . 
War now beckons in Iraq . 
For advocates of open markets and free trade this experience poses major challenges . 
Why is globalization so at risk ? 
Why are its benefits seemingly concentrated in a few locations ? 
Can a more balanced globalization be achieved ? 
No easy answers to these questions exist . 
Open markets are necessary for economic growth , but they are hardly sufficient . 
Some regions of the world have done extremely well from globalization - notably East Asia and China in recent years . 
Yet some regions have done miserably , especially sub-Saharan Africa . 
The US Government pretends that most problems in poor countries are of their own making . 
Africa &apos;s slow growth , say American leaders , is caused by Africa &apos;s poor governance . 
Life , however , is more complicated than the Bush Administration believes . 
Consider Africa &apos;s best governed countries - Ghana , Tanzania , Malawi , Gambia . 
Each experienced falling living standards over the past two decades while many countries in Asia that rank lower on international comparisons of governance - Pakistan , Bangladesh , Myanmar and Sri Lanka - experienced better economic growth . 
The truth is that economic performance is determined not only by governance standards , but by geopolitics , geography , and economic structure . 
Countries with large populations , and hence large internal markets , tend to grow more rapidly than countries with small populations . 
( Like all such economic tendencies , there are counterexamples ) . 
Coastal countries tend to outperform landlocked countries . 
Countries with high levels of malaria tend to endure slower growth than countries with lower levels of malaria . 
Developing countries that neighbor rich markets , such as Mexico , tend to outperform countries far away from major markets . 
These differences matter . 
If rich countries don &apos;t pay heed to such structural issues , we will find that the gaps between the world &apos;s winners and losers will continue to widen . 
If rich countries blame unlucky countries - claiming that they are somehow culturally or politically unfit to benefit from globalization - we will create not only deeper pockets of poverty but also deepening unrest . 
This , in turn , will result in increasing levels of violence , backlash , and yes , terrorism . 
So it &apos;s time for a more serious approach to globalization than rich countries , especially America , offer . 
It should begin with the most urgent task - meeting the basic needs of the world &apos;s poorest peoples . 
In some cases their suffering can be alleviated mainly through better governance within their countries . 
But in others , an honest look at the evidence will reveal that the basic causes are disease , climatic instability , poor soils , distances from markets , and so forth . 
An honest appraisal would further show that the poorest countries are unable to raise sufficient funds to solve such problems on their own . 
Rather than rich countries giving more lectures about poor governance , real solutions will require that rich countries give sufficient financial assistance to overcome the deeper barriers . 
One illustration makes the case vividly . 
Controlling disease requires a health system that can deliver life-saving medications and basic preventive services such as bed-nets to fight malaria and vitamins to fight nutritional deficiencies . 
Such a system costs , at the least , around $ 40 per person per year . 
That &apos;s a tiny amount of money for rich countries , which routinely spend over $ 2000 per person per year for health , but it is a sum out of reach for poor countries like Malawi , with annual incomes of $ 200 per person . 
A functioning health system would cost more than its entire government revenue ! 
Even if Malawi is well governed , its people will die of disease in large numbers unless Malawi receives adequate assistance . 
Successful globalization requires that we think more like doctors and less like preachers . 
Rather than castigating the poor for their &quot; sins , &quot; we should make careful diagnoses , as a good doctor would , for each country and region - to understand the fundamental factors that retard economic growth and development . 
In some regions , such as the Andes and Central Asia , the problem is primarily geographical isolation . 
Here the task is to build roads , air links , and internet connectivity to help these distant regions create productive ties with the world . 
Rich countries must help finance these projects . 
In sub-Saharan Africa , the basic challenges are disease control , soil fertility , and expanded educational opportunities . 
Once again , greater foreign assistance will be needed . 
In still other regions , the main problems may be water scarcity , discrimination against women or other groups , or one of a variety of specific problems . 
It is past time to take globalization &apos;s complexities seriously . 
The one-size-fits-all ideology of the Washington Consensus is finished . 
As we stand at the brink of war , it is urgent that the hard job of making globalization work for all gets started . 
This can be done , if we remove the ideological blinkers of the rich , and mobilize a partnership between rich and poor . 
Our common future depends on it .
