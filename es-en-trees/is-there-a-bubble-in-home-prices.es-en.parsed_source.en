Is There a Bubble in Home Prices ? 
Around the world , newspapers trumpet a &quot; housing bubble &quot; about to burst . 
The Economist has run numerous cautionary articles with titles like &quot; Castles in Hot Air . &quot; 
&quot; Housing Prices Soar , Fueling Bubble Fears , &quot; chirped The Wall Street Journal . 
&quot; The Property Bubble Menaces Growth , &quot; warned Le Monde . 
&quot; Homes Bubble May go Toxic , &quot; The Sydney Morning Herald admonished . 
Are such fears justified ? 
How do we know if the housing market is in a bubble ? 
The term &quot; bubble &quot; is widely used but rarely defined . 
A bubble occurs when public expectations for future price increases become exaggerated , pushing prices up to unsustainable levels . 
When this happens , many people buy homes to rent out as investment properties , and many more who are buying homes to live in also behave like investors , fearing that if they wait , they will be priced out of the market . 
During a bubble , buyers are relatively undeterred by high prices because they think that even bigger price increases will compensate them for spending too much . 
If expectations of rapid and steady future price increases are important motivating factors , then the price level is inherently unstable , because prices cannot rise forever . 
The bubble will eventually burst and prices will fall . 
At least one aspect of a housing bubble is visible : rapid price increases . 
A surge in home prices has infected almost all advanced countries since 2000 , with the exception of Germany and Japan . 
But the key question is whether expectations of large future price increases are sustaining the market . 
If the relationship between average incomes and house prices is stable , then economic fundamentals clearly have the potential to explain prices . 
The increase in housing prices during the 1980 &apos;s is now viewed as the veritable model of a boom cycle turned bust . 
A pattern of sharp price increases , which peaked around 1990 , was followed by declines in cities from Boston and Los Angeles to London , Sydney , and Tokyo , contributing to severe regional recessions . 
Will the current run-up in prices be followed by similar , or worse , collapses ? 
Evidence about a housing bubble in the 1980 &apos;s was compelling . 
Buyers were influenced by strong expectations about future price increases , and they perceived little risk . 
Responses to a survey that my colleague Karl Case and I conducted in 1988 during the US boom revealed that casual word-of-mouth transmission of emotional excitement played a big role in purchasing decisions . 
Moreover , there was no agreement among buyers about the causes of recent price movements and no cogent analysis of fundamentals . 
Earlier this year , we conducted another survey of US homebuyers who bought between March and August of 2002 . 
For the vast majority , investment was either &quot; a major consideration &quot; or at least &quot; in part &quot; a motive for buying . 
But far fewer homebuyers in 2003 said that they were buying &quot; strictly for investment purposes &quot; than in 1988 . 
Thus , conditions would appear to be consistent with a bubble , though less so than in the 1980 &apos;s . 
The US is hardly alone . 
In Europe , the average ratio of home prices to incomes is slightly below its long-term average , mainly because housing prices in Germany are at historically low levels by this measure . 
In France , Italy , and Belgium , the ratio is close to its long-term average , and in Spain , the Netherlands , and Ireland , it is 40-50 % above it . 
Australia , too , is close to the level that preceded previous crashes . 
These are averages across whole countries , but some regions are more overvalued than others . 
This is likely to be the case for &quot; glamour cities &quot; in which international celebrities , entertainment industries , world-class universities , or high technology industries are located . 
Home prices in these cities are high as well as volatile . 
The surveys in 1988 and 2003 showed that the central issue is the role of price expectations . 
In both booms , roughly 90 % of respondents in the US expected an increase in home prices over the next several years , with large expected increases over the next 12 months , surpassing 15 % in San Francisco in 2003 . 
Longer-term expectations were almost as high . 
Indeed , word-of-mouth transmission of excitement about real estate prices is nearly as prevalent now as in 1988 . 
In &quot; glamour cities , &quot; newspaper articles feature stories of homes that sold well above asking price , and 45 % of respondents in the 2003 survey reported selling at above asking prices in San Francisco . 
More than 20 % of sellers in all markets surveyed felt that that their property would have sold as quickly if they had charged 5 % or 10 % more . 
Even so , the 2003 survey indicates that US homebuyers are not as confident of real estate prices now as before the 1980 &apos;s bubble burst . 
This may mean that buyers will not allow prices to rise like last time , but it could also mean that owners will be more ready to exit from the market . 
This may amplify any price declines , especially in &quot; glamour cities &quot; and those with weakening economies . 
The consequences could be severe , and not only in the US , where 21 % of mortgages last year were for more than 90 % of a home &apos;s purchase price , up from 7 % at the peak of the boom in the late 1980s . 
Australian household debt over the past decade has soared from 55 % to 130 % of personal disposable income . 
Judging from the historical record , housing price declines fortunately tend to be relatively local , and nationwide drops are unlikely . 
This should blunt the macroeconomic impact of bursting bubbles . 
The bad news , though , is that the run-up of personal debt means that many households will be left with liabilities exceeding the value of their homes , implying a rising number of bankruptcies .
