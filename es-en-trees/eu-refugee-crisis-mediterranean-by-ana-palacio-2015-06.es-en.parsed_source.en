A Lifeline for European Solidarity 
MADRID - A human tragedy is unfolding in the Mediterranean , with hundreds of thousands of refugees risking - and , in many cases , losing - their lives for the chance to find refuge in Europe . 
How the European Union responds to this crisis matters not just for humanitarian reasons ; it will also be a bellwether of the future of the Union itself . 
The EU must get it right . 
Europe faces no shortage of challenges . 
Over the last five years , it has confronted a seemingly endless series of tests , including a eurozone-wide financial crisis , Russia &apos;s invasion of Ukraine , renewed fears of a Greek default , and the prospect of a British exit . 
But none has raised such fundamental questions about the meaning of the EU as the current debate about migration . 
Unfortunately , efforts so far have been inconsistent . 
The EU acted quickly in the aftermath of the drowning of more than 1,000 migrants in a particularly horrific episode in April , tripling the budget of its much-maligned naval surveillance operations and expanding their operational area to match Italy &apos;s discontinued Mare Nostrum operation . 
This move has already borne fruit , with record numbers of rescues late last month . 
Another initiative - the European Commission &apos;s proposed &quot; Agenda on Migration &quot; - is less straightforward . 
An important and controversial offshoot of the agenda is the action plan against migrant smuggling , which may include the use of military force to stop the smugglers &quot; boats . 
Critics have questioned the plan &apos;s legality , the risk of collateral damage , and , most important , the effectiveness of armed intervention in stemming human-trafficking operations . 
There is also the troubling prospect that such a showy initiative would , by creating the impression that the EU is taking action , enable the EU and its members to avoid the long-term commitment and politically unpopular measures that an effective crisis response would demand . 
And , indeed , the EU has so far been focusing on a largely symbolic measure : the proposed EU-wide relocation and resettlement system for asylum seekers . 
At first glance , the relocation system - which would move 40,000 asylum-seekers from Italy and Greece to other EU members countries , with the allocation determined according to factors such as GDP , population , and the unemployment rate - may seem like a substantial step . 
But , with Italy alone having received more than 63,000 asylum applications and 170,000 irregular migrants last year , the program &apos;s impact would be minimal . 
The European Commission &apos;s proposal is intended to underscore European solidarity and burden-sharing - both core EU principles . 
But the plan &apos;s limited scope undermines this impression . 
Worse , the response to the plan - with some member states opting out of the program ; others objecting to how the quotas are to be measured ; and still others bristling at the idea that the EU should propose a quota at all - seems to suggest that it is every country for itself . 
Throughout these discussions , the line between asylum seekers and economic migrants , who are not protected by binding international humanitarian conventions , has been blurred . 
These squabbles in the face of undeniable , large-scale human suffering controvert the EU &apos;s core values , including its commitment to adhere to a rules-based international order . 
They also reflect a disturbing trend affecting EU institutions : individual countries &quot; interests are increasingly trumping unity and cooperation . 
The problem is that many Europeans regard the EU as either a dispenser of benefits , a bogeyman , or an albatross - not something to which they are obliged in any way . 
As the financial crisis has dragged on , and recriminations among member countries have weakened the sense of community that forms the EU &apos;s foundations , the refugee challenge has exacerbated a dangerous divisiveness . 
Instead of reinforcing its foundations with solidarity and compassion , the Union has fractured . 
In fact , Europe &apos;s interest in mounting an effective response to the crisis extends beyond values . 
As rapid population aging generates significant fiscal pressures , EU members have a strong economic incentive to accept more immigrants . 
The short-term challenges that doing so would pose , however , seem to be obscuring this fact . 
But the refugee challenge is not a short-term issue . 
On the contrary , with countries throughout the Middle East and Africa facing continued violence , poverty , and governmental breakdown , the crisis will only deepen . 
In Libya alone , an estimated 500,000 to one million additional migrants are awaiting passage to Europe . 
It is time to place principle back at the forefront of policy . 
EU leaders must make a clear commitment to do what it takes to address the refugee crisis - even if that means pushing through measures , such as expanded options for legal migration , that are neither expedient nor popular . 
To facilitate implementation , the EU and its member states could initiate a campaign to educate the public about the benefits of a more supple and responsive immigration system . 
No response , it must be stressed , would be complete without a sustained commitment to addressing the drivers of mass immigration - and that means a complete overhaul of the EU &apos;s Neighborhood Policy . 
The new policy should focus on contributing to the creation of economic opportunities in countries with large unemployed youth populations , so that young people no longer feel that risking their lives to reach Europe is their only chance at a future . 
All of this will require a sustained commitment , underpinned by a strong sense of common purpose . 
If Europeans do not stand together in addressing migration , countless more people will drown in the Mediterranean and the EU will continue to unravel . 
It is as simple as that .
