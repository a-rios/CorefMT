The Ozone Mafia 
Now that the Kyoto Protocol has been ratified , with even Russia belatedly signing on , a threat is emerging against an earlier landmark in international environmental protection - the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol for defending the stratospheric ozone layer . 
The threat comes from an unlikely source : organized crime . 
The reason is simple . 
To protect the stratospheric ozone layer , international agreements have been reached to ban the use and trade of the ozone-destroying chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons ( CFC &apos;s ) . 
In order to replace these chemicals with others that are more benign , the equipment in which they are used - like freezers , coolers , and units for foam plastic production - must be substituted for new ones . 
But it &apos;s much cheaper , although forbidden , to use the old equipment and refill them with CFC &apos;s when needed than to buy new machines and use the more environmentally benign but more costly alternatives . 
As with any ban , a market was thus created - and with it a business opportunity for well organized and environmentally reckless criminals . 
Organized crime is constantly on the lookout for such opportunities , and it continues to find them . 
These agreements are hailed as great successes , and annual reports summarizing official statistics are published showing that the use of CFC continues to decrease . 
The content of chlorine ( from decay of CFC &apos;s ) in the stratosphere has leveled off , and two years ago the ozone hole over the Antarctic was the smallest in decades ( and broken up into two ) . 
However , new reports show a thinning of the ozone layer over the Arctic , and last year &apos;s Antarctic ozone hole was as large and deep as ever . 
There is no way of telling yet whether these represent mere fluctuations in a slow recovery process or a break in the positive trend . 
Is the volume of illicit CFC trading so large that it is now a factor of real importance ? 
As with illicit drugs , it is difficult to estimate the extent of smuggling operations . 
A number of extensive catches have been made by national customs agencies , the largest in Japan , in recent years . 
In most cases , the forbidden CFC &apos;s have been labeled as permitted HFC &apos;s ( hydrogenfluorocarbons ) , but labels like &quot; spray paint &quot; and &quot; lubricants &quot; also have been used . 
Ships and airplanes have been used for transport in this black-market trade . 
The shipments caught by customs authorities mostly originate from free industrial zones , also called export-processing zones , in China , Vietnam , Thailand , and Egypt . 
In most parts of the world , customs agencies are not especially focused on CFC &apos;s , and the compounds are not easy to distinguish from HFC &apos;s without sophisticated analytical equipment . 
Complicated lines of transport using transit countries are often used . 
One such line , which is presumed to be significant , goes from Europe ( Spain ) via Singapore or Dubai , through India to Nepal or Bangladesh and back again to the market in India . 
Some features in the conventions for protecting the ozone layer constitute holes of a legal kind . 
One is that industrial and developing countries march at different speeds when it comes to phasing out CFC &apos;s . 
Another problem is that there are no restrictions on the sale of old equipment that runs only on the banned substances . 
For example , freezers that require CFC &apos;s can be freely exported from , say , Sweden , where they can no longer legally be refilled when required , to Egypt , where refilling is allowed . 
The rapid increase of foam plastic production in export processing zones is thought to be based on their purchase of CFC-dependent production units from OECD countries . 
So , do such practices constitute a real threat to the conventions for protecting the stratospheric ozone , or are they &quot; only &quot; a factor that will delay the final phase-out of CFC &apos;s within years or a decade ? 
If the latter , that is bad enough , but the answer is not self-evident , and the whole question of organized crime and the illegal trade with CFC &apos;s demands attention . 
Customs officials all over the world and fighters of organized crime have a new battle - this time for the environment - on their already busy hands .
