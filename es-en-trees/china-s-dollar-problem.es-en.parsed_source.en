China &apos;s Dollar Problem 
CAMBRIDGE - When will China finally realize that it cannot accumulate dollars forever ? 
It already has more than $ 2 trillion . 
Do the Chinese really want to be sitting on $ 4 trillion in another five to 10 years ? 
With the United States government staring at the long-term costs of the financial bailout , as well as inexorably rising entitlement costs , shouldn &apos;t the Chinese worry about a repeat of Europe &apos;s experience from the 1970 &quot; s ? 
During the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s , Europeans amassed a huge stash of US Treasury bills in an effort to maintain fixed exchange-rate pegs , much as China has done today . 
Unfortunately , the purchasing power of Europe &apos;s dollars shriveled during the 1970 &quot; s , when the costs of waging the Vietnam War and a surge in oil prices ultimately contributed to a calamitous rise in inflation . 
Perhaps the Chinese should not worry . 
After all , the world leaders who just gathered at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh said that they would take every measure to prevent such a thing from happening again . 
A key pillar of their prevention strategy is to scale back &quot; global imbalances , &quot; a euphemism for the huge US trade deficit and the corresponding trade surpluses elsewhere , not least China . 
The fact that world leaders recognize that global imbalances are a huge problem is welcome news . 
Many economists , including myself , believe that America &apos;s thirst for foreign capital to finance its consumption binge played a critical role in the build-up of the crisis . 
Cheap money from abroad juiced an already fragile financial regulatory and supervisory structure that needed discipline more than cash . 
Unfortunately , we have heard leaders - especially from the US - claim before that they recognized the problem . 
In the run-up to the financial crisis , the US external deficit was soaking up almost 70 % of the excess funds saved by China , Japan , Germany , Russia , Saudi Arabia , and all the countries with current-account surpluses combined . 
Europeans , who were called on to improve productivity and raise domestic demand , reformed their economies at a glacial pace , while China maintained its export-led growth strategy . 
It took the financial crisis to put the brakes on US borrowing train - America &apos;s current-account deficit has now shrunk to just 3 % of its annual income , compared to nearly 7 % a few years ago . 
With the US government currently tapping financial markets for a whopping 12 % of national income ( roughly $ 1.5 trillion ) , foreign borrowing would be off the scale but for a sudden surge in US consumer and corporate savings . 
As the economy normalizes , consumption and investment will resume . 
When they do - and assuming that the government does not suddenly tighten its belt ( it has no credible plan to do so ) - there is every likelihood that America &apos;s appetite for foreign cash will surge again . 
Of course , the US government claims to want to rein in borrowing . 
Yes , the Federal Reserve could tighten monetary policy . 
In our new book This Time is Different : Eight Centuries of Financial Folly , Carmen Reinhart and I find that if financial crises hold one lesson , it is that their aftereffects have a very long tail . 
Any real change in the near term must come from China , which increasingly has the most to lose from a dollar debacle . 
So far , China has looked to external markets so that exporters can achieve the economies of scale needed to improve quality and move up the value chain . 
But there is no reason in principle that Chinese planners cannot follow the same model in reorienting the economy to a more domestic-demand-led growth strategy . 
But , with consumption accounting for 35 % of national income ( compared to 70 % in the US ! ) , there is vast room to grow . 
Chinese leaders clearly realize that their hoard of T-Bills is a problem . 
Otherwise , they would not be calling so publicly for the International Monetary Fund to advance an alternative to the dollar as a global currency . 
They are right to worry . 
A dollar crisis is not around the corner , but it is certainly a huge risk over the next five to 10 years . 
China does not want to be left holding a $ 4 trillion bag when it happens . 
It is up to China to take the lead on the post-Pittsburgh agenda .
