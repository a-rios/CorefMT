Anti-Semitism on Trial 
When Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court ruled in the case of Sigfried Ellwanger Â­ - an editor , author , and notorious Nazi sympathizer - it entered the perilous field where free speech and efforts to contain racism meet . 
For years , Ellwanger published anti-Semitic books , such as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , as well as books of Holocaust denial , such as his own Jewish or German Holocaust : Behind the Lie of the Century . 
By a vote of eight to three , the Court upheld his conviction on charges of racism . 
Of course , the enormity of the Holocaust ought to have eradicated anti-Semitism for all time . 
Shamefully , it did not . 
In many places , hatred of Jews thrives . 
Elsewhere - including Europe and the United States - anti-Semitism survives among a fringe of neo-Nazis and renegades like Ellwanger , but also , more widely , in milder forms of prejudice . 
But punishing someone criminally for being an anti-Semite and a racist propagandist raises troublesome issues that different countries approach in different ways . 
To be sure , every country places some limits on speech . 
As Oliver Wendell Holmes famously put it in a 1919 US Supreme Court decision , &quot; Even the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting &apos; fire &apos; in a crowded theater and causing a panic . &quot; 
Banning someone from shouting &quot; Fire ! &quot; in a crowded theater is not the same , however , as convicting him for holding and propagating an opinion , even a despicable one , such as anti-Semitism . 
In a democracy , standard restrictions regulate the time , place , and manner of speech in order to prevent imminent violence and civil disorder . 
They bar threats against , and harassment of , individuals . 
Some countries , such as the US , refuse to go further and regulate speech because of its 
Why , then , do many countries prosecute the hate speech of racists ? 
Why do International Human Rights Conventions stipulate that the law should prohibit speech that supports national , racial , or religious hatred ? 
Is any form of race-related speech that anybody finds offensive to be prosecuted ? 
Will such prosecutions actually deter hard-core racists ? 
No court should convict someone lightly because of the views he espouses in the public sphere . 
But Ellwanger &apos;s appeal , which took almost a year for Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court to hear and decide , put Brazil squarely on the side of those who believe that inciting hatred against even a small minority - such as Jews in Brazil - cannot be allowed in the name of freedom of speech . 
The Ellwanger case arose because many believe that anti-racism laws can be effective in reassuring minorities of their safety and place in the community . 
Brazil is a large , pluralist , multi-ethnic country . 
Its social fabric , like that of many other countries around the world , depends on mutual trust among citizens . 
Constitutional and legal provisions that make practicing racism a crime punishable by imprisonment have great symbolic significance and help insure - indeed , create and secure - social peace . 
Defining the offensive racist views proscribed by the Constitution was the first challenge in the Ellwanger case , because the defense denied that anti-Semitism constitutes racism at all . 
The Jews , the defense claimed , do not constitute a race . 
In fact , the Jews are , of course , 
The second issue the Court considered was the conflict between constitutional principles : the clash between freedom to express one &apos;s thoughts and condemnation of Ellwanger for the crime of racism . 
The court ruled that , ultimately , freedom to express one &apos;s thoughts , however generously conceived in a democracy , must be balanced against other values , such as reputation , honor , privacy , dignity , and equality . 
Ellwanger crossed the line separating free expression from hate speech . 
As in the Ellwanger case , restrictions on free expression should be defined narrowly . 
But by opting for a balanced concept of free speech , Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court followed precedents in a number of European countries condemning Holocaust deniers , as well the opinion of the committee charged with monitoring compliance with the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and the European Court of Human Rights . 
In a world where anti-Semitism and racism fester , where prejudice on national , religious , colored-based , or ethnic grounds foster discrimination , that is the view that best nurtures the rights of all .
