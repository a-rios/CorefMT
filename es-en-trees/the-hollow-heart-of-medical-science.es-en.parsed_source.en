The Hollow Heart of Medical Science 
Why are neuroscientists , molecular biologists , geneticists , and developmental biologists - men and women whose discoveries have forever changed the way we understand ourselves - so uneasy about their futures ? 
The crisis in morale among today &apos;s medical scientists stems not from money problems , nor from the stage of development of their fields , nor from the level of research that is being conducted , but from these scientists &quot; failure to form themselves into proper , humane communities . 
Low morale results from too little kindness and decency ; it is a failure of custom and manners , a loss of social purpose , a diminution of the ability or the will to distinguish right from wrong and then to act rightly . 
At root , low morale is just a consequence of the indifference of medical scientists , busy in their labs , allowing the social and emotional foundations of their field to rot away beneath them . 
The vulnerability of the sciences that focus on the human body and mind lies in the obligation all scientists have to observe their systems with dispassion . 
In these fields , dispassion requires that the medical scientist ignore his or her own vulnerability of mind and body . 
The strain of trying to meet this impossible standard of cool curiosity about one &apos;s own fate imposes an unbearable distance between the scientist of the body and mind , and the body and mind of the scientist . 
Under this strain , medical research scientists are susceptible to the dream that their instruments and procedures have somehow freed them from the limitations of their minds and bodies . 
The conscious expression of this dream is an obsessive response to the certainty of biological death : the belief that a big enough win in the game of science will beat death itself by conferring a form of immortality on the winner . 
Nothing but the thinnest membrane of denial separates the notion of scientific immortality through priority of discovery from this deeper , older , and wholly non-scientific dream of escaping one &apos;s own inevitable death . 
Though today &apos;s biomedical science claims to search for repairs of nature &apos;s defects , too many of its practitioners behave as if their real purpose were only to gain the mythical immortality of precedence , at whatever cost to themselves or others . 
Denial of the fear of mortality and projection of the suppressed wish to transcend nature are the marks of a masked effort to create a biomedical science at war with its own stated purposes . 
The problem is not that science and medicine wish to avoid finding cures ; it is that they are too strongly motivated by an irrational , unconscious need to cure death to be fully motivated by the lesser task of preventing and curing disease in order to delay their patients &quot; - and their own - inevitable ends . 
The irrational , obsessive promises made by scientists and physicians in the past few decades have , in a way , institutionalized the denial of death . 
But these promises are not sustainable . 
A humane version of the biomedical sciences would , for instance , acknowledge that it is not about to transcend the limits of the human body , and so it would no longer make promises that it cannot keep . 
Beyond that , a science that acknowledges an unconscious component in its operations , if not in its methodology , will best serve its practitioners as human beings , as well as being most likely to generate lasting value for the rest of us . 
Such a change cannot happen unless scientists themselves first take the time to consider the consequences of their own behavior toward each other . 
We should begin our reforms in the most conservative way , by rediscovering and rededicating ourselves to the meaning of the title we professors hold . 
&quot; To profess &quot; has a spectrum of meanings : to affirm openly ; declare or claim ; to make a pretense of ; pretend ; to claim skill in or knowledge of ; to affirm belief in ; to receive into a religious order or congregation ; to make an open affirmation ; or to take the vows of a religious order or congregation . 
Rather than choose among all these current meanings , we might begin by returning to the word from which they all evolved , the Middle English &quot; professen , &quot; to take vows . 
Professors do not deserve the title unless they are willing to take the time and make the effort to openly affirm something beyond their data . 
Affirmations and vows are not data-dependent ; they are matters of the heart . 
To be a professor , it seems to me , one must first have something of importance to oneself that needs affirming , and then one must affirm it . 
Morale among professors in science will remain low until they decide that their strongest feelings , as well as their best data , should determine professional behavior and professional status .
