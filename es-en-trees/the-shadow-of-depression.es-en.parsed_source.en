The Shadow of Depression 
BERKELEY - Four times in the past century , a large chunk of the industrial world has fallen into deep and long depressions characterized by persistent high unemployment : the United States in the 1930 &quot; s , industrialized Western Europe in the 1930 &quot; s , Western Europe again in the 1980 &quot; s , and Japan in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Two of these downturns - Western Europe in the 1980 &quot; s and Japan in the 1990 &quot; s - cast a long and dark shadow on future economic performance . 
In both cases , if either Europe or Japan returned - or , indeed , ever returns - to something like the pre-downturn trend of economic growth , it took ( or will take ) decades . 
In a third case , Europe at the end of the 1930 &quot; s , we do not know what would have happened had Europe not become a battlefield following Nazi Germany &apos;s invasion of Poland . 
In only one instance was the long-run growth trend left undisturbed : US production and employment after World War II were not significantly affected by the macroeconomic impact of the Great Depression . 
Of course , in the absence of mobilization for WWII , it is possible and even likely that the Great Depression would have cast a shadow on post-1940 US economic growth . 
That is certainly how things looked , with high levels of structural unemployment and a below-trend capital stock , at the end of the 1930 &quot; s , before mobilization and the European and Pacific wars began in earnest . 
In the US , we can already see signs that the downturn that started in 2008 is casting its shadow on the future . 
Reputable forecasters - both private and public - have been revising down their estimates of America &apos;s potential long-run GDP . 
At least some monetary policymakers believe that recent reductions in the US unemployment rate , which have largely resulted from falling labor-force participation , are just as valid a reason for shifting to more austere policies as reductions in unemployment that reflect increases in employment . 
And much the same processes and responses are at work - with even greater strength - in Europe . 
Most important , however , has been what looks , from today &apos;s perspective , like a permanent collapse in the risk-bearing capacity of the private marketplace , and a permanent and large increase in the perceived riskiness of financial assets worldwide - and of the businesses whose cash flows underpin them . 
Given aging populations in industrial countries , large commitments from governments to social-insurance systems , and no clear plans for balancing government budgets in the long run , we would expect to see inflation and risk premiums - perhaps not substantial , but clearly visible - priced into even the largest and richest economies &quot; treasury debt . 
Sometime over the next generation , the price levels of the US , Japan , and Germany might rise substantially after some government short-sightedly attempts to finance some of its social-welfare spending by printing money . 
The price levels are unlikely to go down . 
Yet the desire to hold assets that avoid the medium-term risks associated with the business cycle has overwhelmed this long-run fundamental risk factor . 
But the risk that the world &apos;s investors currently are trying to avoid by rushing into US , Japanese , and German sovereign debt is not a &quot; fundamental &quot; risk . 
There are no psychological preferences , natural-resource constraints , or technological factors that make investing in private enterprises riskier than it was five years ago . 
Rather , the risk stems from governments &quot; refusal , when push comes to shove , to match aggregate demand to aggregate supply in order to prevent mass unemployment . 
Managing aggregate demand is governments &quot; job . 
While Say &apos;s law - the view that supply creates its own demand - is false in theory , it is true enough in practice that entrepreneurs and enterprises can and do depend on it . 
If the government falls down on the job , John Maynard Keynes wrote 76 years ago , and &quot; demand is deficient ... the individual enterpriser ... is operating with the odds loaded against him . 
The game of hazard which he plays is furnished with many zeros , &quot; which represent &quot; the increment &#91; by which &#93; the world &apos;s wealth has fallen short of ... savings , &quot; owing to &quot; the losses of those whose courage and initiative have not been supplemented by exceptional skill or unusual good fortune . 
But if effective demand is adequate , average skill and average good fortune will be enough . &quot; 
For 62 years , from 1945-2007 , with some sharp but temporary and regionalized interruptions , entrepreneurs and enterprisers could bet that the demand would be there if they created the supply . 
This played a significant role in setting the stage for the two fastest generations of global economic growth the world has ever seen . 
Now the stage has been emptied .
