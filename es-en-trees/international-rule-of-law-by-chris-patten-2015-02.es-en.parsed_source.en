The Rule of the Lawless 
CAIRO - In one of his last essays , the late , great historian Tony Judt asked what we should have learned from the last century , a period in which so many soldiers and civilians died in conflict . 
One important part of the answer , I think , is the critical importance of the rule of law , both domestically and internationally . 
To be sure , there are many other things that are crucial to the good life in peaceful , open societies : freedom of speech , religion , and association , and the power to choose - and remove - your own government . 
But nothing guarantees free societies &apos; liberties as much as the application of the rule of law with equal force to the governed and the governing . 
When I was a British cabinet minister and chairman of the Conservative Party , I had a legal adviser who was aptly named Mr. Maybe . 
When I was taken to task for some infringement of administrative law or alleged excessive use of my legal powers , he would never be able to tell me how the courts would ultimately rule . 
I &apos;d ask Mr. Maybe . 
Authoritarian governments find this a difficult concept to understand . 
I recall negotiations with my Chinese counterpart when I was Governor of Hong Kong . 
I was attempting to explain why the rule of law mattered so much to the territory &apos;s future , and I noted that when I was in the British government , the law applied to me just as much as to those I helped govern . 
My interlocutor thought I was joking . 
What the Chinese practice is rule by law - the law as defined by the Communist Party to its own advantage . 
Consider China &apos;s ongoing anti-corruption campaign , for example . 
It is plainly being used by President Xi Jinping and his ally in the Politburo , Wang Qishan , as a tool to target not just the corrupt , but those who are not part of Xi &apos;s faction of red princelings . 
In Xi &apos;s hands , the law is an instrument for securing his political objectives . 
Likewise , in Russia , President Vladimir Putin rules a state apparatus designed and run by elements of the country &apos;s old intelligence services and its new mafia . 
The law is used to reward the regime &apos;s cronies and to penalize its critics , such as the businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the activist Alexei Navalny . 
Because neither Russia nor China apply the rule of law at home , it is unsurprising that they do not recognize its value in international affairs . 
Indeed , Putin has breached one of the most fundamental principles of international law : that national borders may not be changed by force . 
Indeed , he has made it a regular feature of Russian foreign policy , which is characterized by deceit , bullying , violence , and the desire to restore the empire that was dismembered after the collapse of communism . 
Long before Russia &apos;s armed annexation of Crimea and its invasion of eastern Ukraine , the Kremlin played similar games when it engineered the secession of Georgia &apos;s South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions and propped up the bandit territory of Transnistria in Moldova . 
And , given such blatant disregard for the international order , it is no surprise that Putin &apos;s agents have been implicated in the murder of at least one opponent on the streets of London . 
Building on the Geneva Conventions on the laws of war and similar binding agreements , global rules were first institutionalized with the establishment of the United Nations . 
But , above all , the international framework for managing global affairs was the creation of the United States . 
What was remarkable about this framework was that its principal author , the major superpower of the day , accepted its authority . 
As US President Harry Truman memorably put it , &quot; We all have to recognize - no matter how great our strength - that we must deny ourselves the license to do always as we please . &quot; 
In times when the international system has been under assault , only America has had the standing to provide renewed credibility to the rule of law . 
Unfortunately , this may no longer be the case . 
During President George W. Bush &apos;s administration , the US was willfully destructive of its global interests when it disregarded international law on issues like torture . 
Those US politicians who regard international institutions as anti-American conspiracies are continuing the harm , costing their country much of its moral authority . 
The picture is no brighter in Europe , where countries &apos; willful neglect of their military capabilities has undermined their ability to enforce the rule of law when international mechanisms break down . 
The UN Security Council , meanwhile , has become ineffectual , stymied by the great-power interests of China and Russia . 
So it does nothing , even as Europe &apos;s borders are challenged , Ukrainian citizens are bombed in their homes by Russian troops , and a violent , bandit army ravages the greater Middle East , from the beaches of Libya to the borders of Iran . 
After the massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia in the 1990s , world leaders once again solemnly declared , &quot; Never again . &quot; 
Today , Syrian , Iraqi , and now Egyptian citizens must be wondering what happened to that pledge . 
In short , the growing , bloody challenges of the twenty-first century are to be confronted by a toothless UN , a morally weakened US , and a Europe well on the path toward disarmament . 
If that prospect worries you , it should . 
In the absence of a change of heart by our political leaders , the power of prayer may be our only recourse .
