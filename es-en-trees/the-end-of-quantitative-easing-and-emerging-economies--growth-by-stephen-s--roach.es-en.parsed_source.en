The Global QE Exit Crisis 
NEW HAVEN - The global economy could be in the early stages of another crisis . 
Once again , the US Federal Reserve is in the eye of the storm . 
As the Fed attempts to exit from so-called quantitative easing ( QE ) - its unprecedented policy of massive purchases of long-term assets - many high-flying emerging economies suddenly find themselves in a vise . 
Currency and stock markets in India and Indonesia are plunging , with collateral damage evident in Brazil , South Africa , and Turkey . 
The Fed insists that it is blameless - the same absurd position that it took in the aftermath of the Great Crisis of 2008-2009 , when it maintained that its excessive monetary accommodation had nothing to do with the property and credit bubbles that nearly pushed the world into the abyss . 
It remains steeped in denial : Were it not for the interest-rate suppression that QE has imposed on developed countries since 2009 , the search for yield would not have flooded emerging economies with short-term &quot; hot &quot; money . 
As in the mid-2000 &quot; s , there is plenty of blame to go around this time as well . 
The Fed is hardly alone in embracing unconventional monetary easing . 
Moreover , the aforementioned developing economies all have one thing in common : large current-account deficits . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , India &apos;s external deficit , for example , is likely to average 5 % of GDP in 2012-2013 , compared to 2.8 % in 2008-2011 . 
Similarly , Indonesia &apos;s current-account deficit , at 3 % of GDP in 2012-2013 , represents an even sharper deterioration from surpluses that averaged 0.7 % of GDP in 2008-2011 . 
Comparable patterns are evident in Brazil , South Africa , and Turkey . 
A large current-account deficit is a classic symptom of a pre-crisis economy living beyond its means - in effect , investing more than it is saving . 
The only way to sustain economic growth in the face of such an imbalance is to borrow surplus savings from abroad . 
That is where QE came into play . 
It provided a surplus of yield-seeking capital from investors in developed countries , thereby allowing emerging economies to remain on high-growth trajectories . 
IMF research puts emerging markets &quot; cumulative capital inflows at close to $ 4 trillion since the onset of QE in 2009 . 
Enticed by the siren song of a shortcut to rapid economic growth , these inflows lulled emerging-market countries into believing that their imbalances were sustainable , enabling them to avoid the discipline needed to put their economies on more stable and viable paths . 
This is an endemic feature of the modern global economy . 
Rather than owning up to the economic slowdown that current-account deficits signal - accepting a little less growth today for more sustainable growth in the future - politicians and policymakers opt for risky growth gambits that ultimately backfire . 
That has been the case in developing Asia , not just in India and Indonesia today , but also in the 1990 &quot; s , when sharply widening current-account deficits were a harbinger of the wrenching financial crisis of 1997-1998 . 
But it has been equally true of the developed world . 
America &apos;s gaping current-account deficit of the mid-2000 &quot; s was , in fact , a glaring warning of the distortions created by a shift to asset-dependent saving at a time when dangerous bubbles were forming in asset and credit markets . 
Europe &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis is an outgrowth of sharp disparities between the peripheral economies with outsize current-account deficits - especially Greece , Portugal , and Spain - and core countries like Germany , with large surpluses . 
Central bankers have done everything in their power to finesse these problems . 
Under the leadership of Ben Bernanke and his predecessor , Alan Greenspan , the Fed condoned asset and credit bubbles , treating them as new sources of economic growth . 
Bernanke has gone even further , arguing that the growth windfall from QE would be more than sufficient to compensate for any destabilizing hot-money flows in and out of emerging economies . 
Yet the absence of any such growth windfall in a still-sluggish US economy has unmasked QE as little more than a yield-seeking liquidity foil . 
The QE exit strategy , if the Fed ever summons the courage to pull it off , would do little more than redirect surplus liquidity from higher-yielding developing markets back to home markets . 
At present , with the Fed hinting at the first phase of the exit - the so-called QE taper - financial markets are already responding to expectations of reduced money creation and eventual increases in interest rates in the developed world . 
Never mind the Fed &apos;s promises that any such moves will be glacial - that it is unlikely to trigger any meaningful increases in policy rates until 2014 or 2015 . 
As the more than 1.1 percentage-point increase in 10-year Treasury yields over the past year indicates , markets have an uncanny knack for discounting glacial events in a short period of time . 
Courtesy of that discounting mechanism , the risk-adjusted yield arbitrage has now started to move against emerging-market securities . 
Not surprisingly , those economies with current-account deficits are feeling the heat first . 
Suddenly , their saving-investment imbalances are harder to fund in a post-QE regime , an outcome that has taken a wrenching toll on currencies in India , Indonesia , Brazil , and Turkey . 
As a result , these countries have been left ensnared in policy traps : Orthodox defense strategies for plunging currencies usually entail higher interest rates - an unpalatable option for emerging economies that are also experiencing downward pressure on economic growth . 
Where this stops , nobody knows . 
That was the case in Asia in the late 1990 &quot; s , as well as in the US in 2009 . 
But , with more than a dozen major crises hitting the world economy since the early 1980 &quot; s , there is no mistaking the message : imbalances are not sustainable , regardless of how hard central banks try to duck the consequences . 
Developing economies are now feeling the full force of the Fed &apos;s moment of reckoning . 
They are guilty of failing to face up to their own rebalancing during the heady days of the QE sugar high . 
And the Fed is just as guilty , if not more so , for orchestrating this failed policy experiment in the first place .
