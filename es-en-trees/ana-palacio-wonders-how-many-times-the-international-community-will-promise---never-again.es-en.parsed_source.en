Forsaken Syria 
MADRID - In this year of ubiquitous commemorations , the centennial of Jan Karski &apos;s birth has been largely overlooked . 
And yet Karski &apos;s legacy is more important than ever - nowhere more so than in Syria . 
As the Geneva II peace process slogs along - leaving cadavers and atrocities to pile up - Karski &apos;s dedication to bringing the plight of Poland &apos;s Jews to the world &apos;s attention during World War II , despite the inertia of governments and publics , embodies exactly what Syria desperately needs . 
In 1942 , Karski , a Polish-born diplomat , traveled to the United Kingdom to report on what came to be called the Holocaust . 
The next year , he embarked on a mission to the United States to brief President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other dignitaries on the horrors that he had witnessed . 
In both cases , he was met with skepticism and apathy . 
Indeed , it was only toward the end of the war that action was taken to stop the slaughter . 
Although the Holocaust is a category of persecution sui generis , one cannot avoid thinking of Karski in light of the international community &apos;s approach to Syria today . 
Expectations for the Geneva talks are so low that trivial matters - such as the fact that President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s negotiators and the opposition are sitting together in the same room ( though not at the same table ) - are being hailed as successes . 
Even the agreement to allow women and children to leave blockaded areas of the city of Homs - an anti-Assad stronghold - fell far short of international mediators &quot; vision ( and even this achievement seems to be in doubt ) . 
Instead of allowing a United Nations aid convoy to bring humanitarian aid to the area , the government agreed to release women and children on an as-yet-uncertain timeline , while men can leave only after their names had been cleared , raising fears of arrest . 
Meanwhile , amid plodding deliberations of incremental steps that are clearly inadequate , Syrians are being displaced , wounded , tortured , and killed in droves . 
By any measure , the level of suffering in Syria is shocking . 
Although figures do not convey the cruelty by all sides , it has become de rigueur to cite the numbers : more than 100,000 dead , 2.3 million refugees , and four million people internally displaced . 
But a year ago , the figures were already dire : 60,000 dead , 700,000 international refugees , and two million internally displaced . 
If there were a threshold of misery that would cause the world to say , &quot; Enough is enough , &quot; it surely would have been crossed by now . 
The ugly truth is that the world &apos;s response to this crisis has been shaped by geopolitical interests , not the need to put an end to appalling human suffering . 
Indeed , it is no secret that the conflict serves as a proxy for larger struggles - between Saudi Arabia and Iran , Saudi Arabia and Qatar , the US and Iran , Russia and the US , Shia and Sunni Muslims , and moderates and extremists - and that resolving it will require significant effort on all of these fronts . 
From an American perspective , Syria is not strategically critical . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s administration has maintained an intensely inward-looking focus , reinforced by a public wary of foreign engagements . 
Nothing short of a drastic change in the conflict &apos;s nature that threatened America &apos;s core interests would lead to direct US involvement . 
Guilt , after all , is a poor motivator for international action . 
Even the UK and France - the only two countries that were not shy about threatening military action against Assad &apos;s regime - got cold feet when confronted with the possibility of going it alone . 
Instead , the world is responding to graphic images of unspeakable brutality - torture by the regime or executions carried out by the opposition - with sterile shows of outrage . 
The stream of statements , half-measures , and clumsy initiatives has done little to improve the situation - and , in some instances , has made things worse . 
Consider Obama &apos;s call , backed by no action , for Assad to &quot; step aside , &quot; and his repeated promises , dating to early 2012 , to provide non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition - promises that were finally fulfilled late last year , and then only temporarily . 
This gap between rhetoric and action left a vacuum ; 
But the most infamous example of this policy paralysis was Obama &apos;s 2012 declaration that the use of chemical weapons was the &quot; red line &quot; beyond which the US would be forced to intervene . 
His ultimate failure to follow through on his proclamation emboldened and , in a way , re-legitimized Assad . 
It remains to be seen whether Geneva II will follow this pattern . 
The price of the talks has already been high , with all sides having ramped up violence to strengthen their respective positions ahead of the negotiations . 
This is to say nothing of the fiasco surrounding the withdrawn invitation to Iran , whose buy-in will be essential for any resolution . 
In any case , the incremental nature of the talks belies the situation &apos;s urgency . 
Amid the current focus on regime change , a transitional government , and negotiating delegations , there is a real danger that the desperate humanitarian situation will be overlooked . 
Here , citizens have a critical role to play . 
But , like their leaders , publics everywhere have been reticent to act . 
Indeed , opinion polls show that , despite near-universal awareness of the situation in Syria , there is very little public support for intervention . But handwringing will not help ; we - individuals - must accept real responsibility for ending the tragedy and press our leaders to act . 
It has been more than 70 years since Karski presented his report to the world . 
In that time , we have created the United Nations , adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and discussed endlessly governments &quot; &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; their citizens . 
Yet , watching the Syrian tragedy develop , one might conclude that nothing has changed . 
How many times must we say , &quot; Never again &quot; ?
