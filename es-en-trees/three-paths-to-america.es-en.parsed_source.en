Three Paths to America 
President George W. Bush &apos;s free-falling popularity , his loss of control over Congress , the nagging doubts about the economy , and most of all his discredited reputation as a result of the debacle in Iraq all magnify the characteristic weakness of lame-duck American presidents . 
The first response can be described as realist : no matter who governs in America , concrete results need to be achieved . 
Simply put , whoever is US president , his or her program will have priority . 
This type of thinking underpinned Brazil &apos;s agreement to include the issue of bio-fuels in a joint declaration and subsequent meeting of Bush and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva at Camp David . 
The same can be said of Uruguay &apos;s interest in a Free Trade Treaty with the US , as it is seeking alternatives outside of the region &apos;s Mercosur group , and Bush remains keen on bilateral trade deals . 
Colombia , whose alliance with the US precedes President Álvaro Uribe , wants to maintain US support at its current levels , and Mexico now must make combating drug trafficking and illegal immigration priorities , in accordance with US policy . 
Chile and Peru , too , have fallen in line with US priorities by emphasizing their openness to American investment . 
The second Latin American position towards the US is embodied in &quot; Chavism . &quot; 
Indeed , these governments promote constitutional reforms that seek to authorize perpetual re-election and supposedly new forms of participation that , in fact , hollow out representative democracy from within . 
As a political model , Chavism is strongly based on nationalism , so that , Bush or no Bush , its legitimacy requires a growing anti-Americanism . 
Venezuela , Bolivia , Ecuador , and Nicaragua have opted for this pattern of international assertion , which also includes statist economic policies that demonize foreign investment . 
At the same time , these governments practice a diplomacy inspired by one idea : America &apos;s post-Iraq hegemony is fragile , thus making profitable a policy of confrontation aimed at weakening the enemy . 
This explains the bizarre de facto alliance between Venezuela , Iran and Belarus , and Venezuela &apos;s failed candidacy for a seat on the United Nations Security Council . 
Indeed , this vision of international relations clearly rests on building influence through military power . 
Finally , Argentina stands in a category by itself . 
Far from being realistic , and in keeping with its ideological interpretation of international relations and growing approximation to the positions of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , the attitude taken by President Néstor Kirchner &apos;s government links anti-Americanism with the Bush Administration . 
It seems to take for granted a Democratic victory in the US presidential election next year . 
But nothing guarantees that , even if the Democrats win , they will change America &apos;s foreign policies . 
Moreover , some notable candidates , such as Senator Hillary Clinton , supported the invasion of Iraq , while the Democrats are more protectionist than the Republicans and are financially unpredictable . 
In fact , Kirchner should be especially worried by a Democratic victory . 
Roberto Shapiro , a former number two in the Clinton-era Department of Commerce and a man close to the Democratic Party , is now co-chairman of the United States Taskforce for Argentina , an alliance of investment funds and institutional creditors who were hit hard by Argentina &apos;s default on its international debts . 
In contrast to the Clinton era , under Bush the US Treasury Secretary was closer to industry than to banks , and so America &apos;s response to Argentina &apos;s default was notably more tolerant than probably would have been true had it occurred during the Clinton administration . 
Latin America , frankly , will not occupy an eminent position in any future US foreign policy . 
Terrorism , proliferation , Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan , the Middle East , and China are higher priorities . 
What the US lacks is a coherent regional policy toward Latin America comparable to what exists for Asia and Europe . 
Whoever governs America next should formulate one , lest Latin America &apos;s ideologues and dreamers gain the upper hand .
