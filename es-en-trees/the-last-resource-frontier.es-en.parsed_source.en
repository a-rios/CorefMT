The Last Resource Frontier 
OXFORD -In the coming decade , extraction of oil , gas , and mineral ores will constitute by far the most important economic opportunity in Africa &apos;s history . 
Africa is the last frontier for resource discovery , having long been relatively neglected by mining and other resource-extraction companies , owing to difficult political conditions . 
Given that resource extraction per square kilometer in Africa is about 20 % of the OECD average , the total volume of extraction could easily grow fivefold . 
High prices and future discoveries will generate money flows so vast that , if properly managed , they could transform desperately poor parts of Africa into regions of prosperity . 
Certainly , income from resource extraction will dwarf all other financial flows there . 
But , too often in Africa &apos;s history , money that should have financed productive investment has been looted or squandered . 
The challenge now is to prevent the continent &apos;s sad history of exploitation from repeating itself during the coming era of massive resource extraction . 
Whether natural resources are plundered or harnessed for development depends upon several factors . 
The first task is to capture for society as a whole enough of the value of the extracted resources . 
Some recent sales of prospecting rights in Africa have been spectacularly deficient in terms of transparency and competition . 
In Guinea , for example , rights that appear to have been awarded without significant benefit to the public treasury were swiftly re-sold for several billion euros . 
Second , a substantial share of the revenues should be invested in assets rather than used to boost consumption . 
To do otherwise is to infringe upon the rights of members of future generations , to whom natural assets also belong . 
Unfortunately , these rights are often violated . 
Cameroon , for example , has depleted much of its oil , using the revenues overwhelmingly for consumption . 
As a result , its current level of consumption will be unsustainable when the oil runs out . 
Finally , revenues should be open to public scrutiny and their efficient use , both for investment and consumption , must be ensured by institutional mechanisms that impose clear accountability on public officials . 
But revenue and expenditure transparency alone is not enough to ensure good use of natural resources . 
The many decisions required to ensure success must be gotten right not just once but repeatedly , though , without such transparency , the risks of corruption and misallocation obviously are much higher . 
Transparency would also foster trust between companies and local communities . 
So far , communities in the vicinity of extraction operations have often been hostile to the process , seeing themselves as the victims of environmental damage , while domestic elites and foreign companies are presumed to be the primary beneficiaries . 
Such hostility has made the local operations of extractive industries problematic and costly : witness Royal Dutch Shell &apos;s experience in the Niger Delta . 
So , without transparency of revenues and their beneficial use , resource-extraction companies inevitably become the targets of local suspicion . 
Foreign companies manage nearly all resource extraction in Africa , because they alone have the necessary technical skills . 
This implies an important role for the jurisdictions in which these companies are registered , for they have the power to set the rules by which the extractive industries operate . 
Many of these companies are based in Europe , so a good deal of power rests ultimately with the European Parliament . 
Between them , European and American rules can require many resource-extraction companies to be transparent , but there remain many companies that come under other jurisdictions . 
Within the OECD , the main financial center for smaller resource-extraction companies is Toronto , yet the Canadian parliament recently failed narrowly to pass an equivalent requirement for these companies . 
There are also 360 Australian resource-extraction companies - currently operating in Africa . 
In any case , the major new players in resource extraction are not in the OECD . 
Globally , the second largest such company is Vale , based in Brazil , and the Chinese are now the single largest presence in Africa , although China already has some revenue transparency legislation on its books , given the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong financial market . 
What is now needed is global enforcement of transparency standards . 
The appropriate forum for such collective governmental action is the G-20 , whose next meeting is to be hosted and chaired by France . 
Global oversight of resource extraction is a perfect economic-development issue for the G-20 , not least because the theatrical pledges of aid to poor countries that were the stuff of G-8 meetings have now been recognized as empty rhetoric . 
If the G-20 is to be effective as a development instrument , it should begin to tackle the single most important financial flow that Africa and other low-income regions will attract in this new decade .
