Mao , the False God 
Should Chairman Mao &apos;s huge portrait still hang above the front gate of Tiananmen Square ? 
Should China &apos;s ruling party still call itself Communist ? 
These are not idle questions . 
Unless and until China &apos;s leaders answer both questions with a simple &quot; No &quot; they will continue to have blood on their hands and a tainted legitimacy . 
Many Chinese do not accept communist rule precisely because the Communist Party denies its past , ( and remains ) unapologetic about its cruelty . 
This is one reason why China has a Taiwan &quot; problem . &quot; 
The Chinese Communists insist that being Chinese means accepting the political reality of a sole Communist sovereign . 
Indeed , many Taiwanese think that , if being Chinese means accepting all that goes under the name of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party , they will gladly deny their &quot; Chineseness &quot; than assume some of that shame . 
Similarly , while a recent poll found that 70 % of Hong Kong &apos;s people are proud of being ethnic Chinese , a similar percentage are ashamed of the conduct of the mainland government . 
Their message to the government in Beijing is this : you cannot take away our ethnicity but you have soiled our dignity through your barbarism . 
For Hong Kong , the defining symbol of the Communist government is the killing of students with abandon on June 4 , 1989 . 
Enshrined in the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s constitution are the following words : &quot; Mao Zedong , the Party &apos;s chief representative , created Mao Zedong Thought , which has been proved correct by practice and based on which the Communist Party developed the basic system of socialism economically , politically , and culturally after the founding of the People &apos;s Republic . &quot; 
But how &quot; correct &quot; was Mao ? 
In her devastating new book Mao : The Unknown Story , Jung Chang ( author of the international bestseller Wild Swans ) exposes startling new details that prove beyond doubt that Mao was a tyrannical , cruel hypocrite whose disregard for human lives and suffering surpassed that of even Stalin and Hitler . 
Her catalogue of Mao &apos;s &quot; correct practice &quot; is numbing in its immorality and bloodthirstiness . 
To help finance his communist movement in the 1930 &quot; s , Mao squeezed poor peasant families with any assets in the &quot; Red &quot; zone he controlled . 
Many &quot; counter-revolutionary &quot; families were forced out of their homes to live in buffalo sheds so that their meager assets could be requisitioned . 
While hiding out in the caves of Yenan , Mao became a distributor of opium . 
Contrary to myths that he and his insurgents lived frugally during the Yenan days , they lived well on trading profits . 
After the Nationalist government collapsed in 1949 , Mao &apos;s &quot; New China &quot; emerged . 
Almost immediately , he launched another campaign to suppress &quot; counter-revolutionaries , &quot; berating one province for &quot; being too lenient , not killing enough . &quot; 
Killing &quot; enemies &quot; was not the sole purpose . 
Mao wanted to instill obedience by having as many people as possible witness the terror . 
As he put it in 1951 , &quot; Many places don &apos;t dare to kill counter-revolutionaries on a grand scale with big publicity . 
This situation must be changed . &quot; 
In Beijing millions of inhabitants were ordered to witness some 30,000 sentencing and execution rallies during the early 1950 &quot; s . 
Indeed , in 1950 and 1951 an estimated three million people perished by execution , torture , or suicide . 
Masses of Chinese were sent to work camps , where prisoners endured harsh physical labor to &quot; reform &quot; their &quot; bourgeois &quot; habits and thoughts . 
In any given year , roughly 10 million such &quot; laborers &quot; existed . 
During Mao &apos;s rule , an estimated 27 million died in the camps . 
Close to 38 million people died of starvation and overwork during the infamous Great Leap Forward ( 1958-61 ) to catch up with the West . 
Mao &apos;s reaction ? 
&quot; With all these projects , half of China may well have to die . 
If not half , one-third , or one-tenth - 50 million - die .... but you can &apos;t blame me when people die . &quot; 
Mao launched the Cultural Revolution ( 1965-76 ) to take revenge against those who opposed his mad programs . 
Millions more died . 
Mao also ordered the country to destroy the &quot; Four Olds &quot; : old ideas , old culture , old customs , and old habits . 
As a result , his Red Guards destroyed ancient books , priceless antiques , monuments across the land , and nearly all Buddhist monasteries in Tibet . 
In all , it is estimated that more than 70 million people died in the &quot; New China &quot; Mao and the present Communist Party leaders so proudly proclaim as their accomplishment . 
When Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka went to China in 1974 , he bowed deeply to the Chairman , apologizing for the suffering that invading Japanese had caused . 
Mao famously said : &quot; No need to apologize . 
We should thank you instead . 
Without your invasion , we Communists would not have won . &quot; 
What about today &apos;s &quot; New New China , &quot; with its skyscrapers , modern highways , and unbridled capitalism ? 
The reality is not as gleaming as it first looks . 
Annual per capita GDP in Shanghai , China &apos;s showcase city , remains , at $ 3,000 , a small fraction of the levels in Taiwan and Hong Kong . 
Fifty years of communist misrule have left what was once the most advanced city in Asia a distant also-ran . 
China &apos;s communist rulers must own up to their history and drop Mao and the communist legacy . 
The country needs a new constitution - one that enshrines genuine democracy . 
China &apos;s people have long been ready for this . 
Maintaining the false label of communism while reviving capitalism and insisting that Mao , for all his mistakes and crimes , was 70 % &quot; correct &quot; is the bedrock of the moral corruption that afflicts China today . 
It is as if the Nazis were still in power , with the current leaders claiming that Hitler was only 30 % wrong . 
China deserves better ; it requires better in order to reclaim the glory that was China .
