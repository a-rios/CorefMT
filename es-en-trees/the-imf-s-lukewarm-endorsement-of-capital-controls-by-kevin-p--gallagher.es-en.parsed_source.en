The IMF &apos;s Half Step 
BOSTON - &quot; What used to be heresy is now endorsed as orthodox , &quot; John Maynard Keynes remarked in 1944 , after helping to convince world leaders that the newly established International Monetary Fund should allow the regulation of international financial flows to remain a core right of member states . 
By the 1970 &quot; s , however , the IMF and Western powers began to dismantle the theory and practice of regulating global capital flows . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , the Fund went so far as to try to change its Articles of Agreement to mandate deregulation of cross-border finance . 
With much fanfare , the IMF recently embraced a new &quot; institutional view &quot; that seemingly endorses re-regulating global finance . 
While the Fund remains wedded to eventual financial liberalization , it now acknowledges that free movement of capital rests on a much weaker intellectual foundation than does the case for free trade . 
In particular , the IMF now recognizes that capital-account liberalization requires countries to reach a certain threshold with respect to financial and governance institutions , and that many emerging-market and developing countries have not . 
More fundamentally , the Fund has accepted that there are risks as well as benefits to cross-border financial flows , particularly sharp inward surges followed by sudden stops , which can cause a great deal of economic instability . 
What grabbed headlines was that the IMF now believes that countries could even use capital controls , renamed &quot; capital flow management measures , &quot; if implemented alongside monetary and fiscal measures , accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves , and macroprudential financial regulations . 
Even under such circumstances , CFMMs should generally not discriminate on the basis of currency . 
But has the IMF &apos;s reconsideration of financial globalization gone far enough ? 
This month , the IMF &apos;s Independent Evaluation Office released an assessment of the Fund &apos;s policy on reserve accumulation that implies that a &quot; one size fits all &quot; approach to reserve accumulation continues to prevail within the organization . 
Many emerging-market policymakers view accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves during the 2000 &quot; s as having insured their countries against exchange-rate volatility and loss of export competitiveness . 
Yet the IMF pinned significant blame for global financial instability on this policy . 
Not surprisingly , given their decades of experience with the management and mismanagement of capital flows , emerging-market policymakers have been watching the IMF &apos;s &quot; rethink &quot; on these issues very closely . 
From 2009 to 2011 , with advanced economies pursuing near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing , yield-hungry investors flooded countries like South Korea and Brazil with hot money , fueling currency appreciation and inflating asset bubbles . 
When the eurozone panic ensued in July 2011 , inflows came to a halt and fled to the &quot; safety &quot; of the United States , Switzerland , and beyond . 
Unlike in the past , however , emerging and developing countries avoided the worst , precisely because they had learned to accumulate foreign reserves and regulate cross-border capital flows , and to ease such measures to prevent or mitigate sudden stops . 
And yet , despite abundant academic evidence and country experience to the contrary , the IMF remains stubbornly wedded to the idea of eventual capital-account liberalization . 
In a new study that surveys and updates the economics literature , Arvind Subramanian , Olivier Jeanne , and John Williamson conclude that &quot; the international community should not seek to promote totally free trade in assets - even over the long run - because ... free capital mobility seems to have little benefit in terms of long-run growth . &quot; 
Thus , the IMF &apos;s recommendation to use capital controls only after exhausting interest-rate adjustment , reserve accumulation , and prudential regulation is out of step with the profession . 
Indeed , recent work in economic theory shows that capital controls can actually be the optimal policy choice . 
For example , the new welfare economics of capital controls views unstable capital flows as negative externalities on recipient countries , which implies that regulations on cross-border flows are the optimal tools to address market failures , improve market functioning , and enhance growth , not worsen it . 
Indeed , the IMF &apos;s own research shows that countries that deployed capital controls first - or alongside a host of other macroprudential measures - were among the most resilient during the global financial crisis . 
In many cases , the controls were neither market-based nor temporary . 
The IMF also fails to appreciate fully that capital flows should be regulated at &quot; both ends , &quot; or at least that advanced-country regulations will not make matters worse . 
IMF research over the last year has outlined circumstances in which industrialized countries should also take part in regulating global capital flows . 
But the new view also highlights an important obstacle : many advanced countries &quot; trade and investment treaties prohibit the regulation of cross-border finance . 
The good news is that Article VI of the IMF Articles of Agreement still stands : &quot; Members may exercise such controls as are necessary to regulate international capital movements . &quot; 
The IMF is making strides in the right direction , but emerging markets will have to remain in the lead . 
They have proven to be the best judges of their economic needs and priorities ; as they consider the IMF &apos;s new stance on financial globalization , they should continue to heed their own counsel .
