From Fukushima to Disarmament 
SYDNEY - Months after the devastating March 11 earthquake and tsunami hit Japan , the ongoing nuclear disaster at Fukushima compounds the humanitarian tragedy and impedes recovery . 
The damaged reactors and spent-fuel ponds contain around ten times as much nuclear fuel as did the Chernobyl reactor that exploded in 1986 . 
In three reactors , the fuel has melted , almost certainly through the reactor vessels ; primary containment structures have been breached ; explosions have torn away the secondary containment ( the buildings ) ; radioactive releases continue ; and closed-loop cooling has not been re-established . 
More than 100,000 tons of highly radioactive wastewater now flood the facility to capacity , as water continues to be poured in to prevent further massive radioactive emissions . 
The spent fuel in pools adjacent to each reactor , containing more radioactivity than the reactors themselves , has also been severely damaged , has leaked radioactivity , and is still without needed stable cooling . 
The spent fuel at the Reactor 4 caused a hydrogen explosion and fire on March 15 . 
As a result , large amounts of radiation , on a scale comparable to Chernobyl , have already been released into the air , earth , and ocean . 
Further releases will continue , probably for years . 
And yet , while the Fukushima disaster is attracting overdue global attention to nuclear safety and security , and provoking a reconsideration of nuclear power , its implications for nuclear weapons remain largely unremarked . 
The nuclear reactions that drive reactors and weapons are the same , as are the radioactive products that are dispersed by wind , rain , and water if released , with the same lack of respect for borders and the same indiscriminate long-term cancer and genetic hazards . 
At Fukushima , a perfect storm - a massive earthquake and tsunami , multiple vulnerable coastal reactors with spent-fuel ponds in the same buildings , inadequate barriers , loss of power , and back-up generators situated too low - may have seemed a remote possibility . 
Problems had occurred at similar reactors before . 
Fukushima &apos;s operator , Tokyo Electric Power Company ( TEPCO ) , had a poor safety culture and a long history of falsifying and covering up inspection and safety data . 
No nuclear reactors are designed to withstand an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 . 
Yet there were 11 earthquakes greater than 8.5 last century , and only 11 years into this century , there have been five . 
Almost all were followed by tsunamis . 
The seawall at Fukushima was designed for a tsunami no higher than 5.7 meters . 
Yet the same coast was devastated by a 38-meter tsunami in 1896 , and again by a 29-meter tsunami in 1933 . 
Moreover , no nuclear reactors are built to withstand an attack like that of September 11 , 2001 - which was also unforeseen . 
The aircraft that crashed in a Pennsylvania field was , it should be recalled , less than ten minutes away from the Three Mile Island nuclear plant . 
Fukushima has highlighted how vulnerable spent-fuel ponds are to direct damage or disruption of power , water , or pumps for cooling . 
These pools contain vast amounts of long-lived radioactivity , typically in a simple building , without multiple engineered layers of containment . 
Each of the world &apos;s 437 nuclear power reactors and associated spent-fuel ponds are effectively enormous pre-positioned radiological weapons , or &quot; dirty bombs . &quot; 
Moreover , the world is wired with 22,400 nuclear weapons . 
Around 1,770 of them in Russia and the US , and a further 64 in France and 48 in the United Kingdom , remain on high alert , ready to be launched in response to a perceived attack with only minutes for verification and decision . 
Recent history is peppered with a litany of false alerts and near misses , each unforeseen , each a combination of technical and human failure . 
The growing potential for a nuclear disaster by cyber attack adds to the existential danger . 
We now know that just 100 relatively &quot; small &quot; Hiroshima-size nuclear weapons , less than one-thousandth of the global nuclear arsenal , could lift millions of tons of dark smoke high into the atmosphere . 
There , it would abruptly cool and darken the planet , slashing rainfall and food production in successive years - and thus causing worldwide starvation on a scale never before witnessed . 
This could result from the arsenals of any of the ten currently nuclear-armed states , with the exception of North Korea . 
Intent , miscalculation , technical failure , cyber attack , or accident could cause the nuclear escalation of a conflict between India and Pakistan , in the Middle East ( embroiling Israel &apos;s nuclear weapons ) , or on the Korean peninsula . 
Such outcomes are at least as plausible or likely - if not more so - than a massive earthquake and tsunami causing widespread damage to four Japanese nuclear reactors and their adjacent spent-fuel ponds . 
Any country that can enrich uranium to fuel nuclear reactors has everything it needs to enrich uranium further , to weapons-grade strength . 
In a nuclear reactor , 1-2 % of the uranium fuel is inevitably converted to plutonium . 
Currently , there is no restriction on any country building a uranium-enrichment plant or reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium . 
As we have seen , safeguards alone are not up to the job . 
We will not prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons and their eventual use , much less achieve a world free of nuclear weapons , without strict international control of all uranium enrichment , and without banning the separation of plutonium from spent fuel . 
That which cannot be controlled must be prevented . 
Today , that means preventing the threat of climate change and eradicating nuclear weapons . 
Attempting to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions through nuclear energy , thereby fueling the dangers of the ultimate global incendiary - nuclear war - could be the most tragic of all miscalculations .
