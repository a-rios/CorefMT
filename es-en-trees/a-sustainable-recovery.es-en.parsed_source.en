A Sustainable Recovery 
NEW YORK - The global recession now underway is the result not only of a financial panic , but also of more basic uncertainty about the future direction of the world economy . 
Consumers are pulling back from home and automobile purchases not only because they have suffered a blow to their wealth with declining stock prices and housing values , but also because they don &apos;t know where to turn . 
Should they risk buying a new car when gasoline prices might soar again ? 
Will they be able to put food on the table after this year &apos;s terrifying rise in food prices ? 
Decisions about business investment are even starker . 
Businesses are reluctant to invest at a time when consumer demand is plummeting and they face unprecedented risk penalties on their borrowing costs . 
They are also facing huge uncertainties . 
What kinds of power plants will be acceptable in the future ? 
Will they be allowed to emit carbon dioxide as in the past ? 
Can the United States still afford a suburban lifestyle , with sprawling homes in far-flung communities that require long-distance automobile commutes ? 
To a large extent , economic recovery will depend on a much clearer sense of the direction of future economic change . 
That is largely the job of government . 
After the confused and misguided leadership of the Bush administration , which failed to give any clear path to energy , health , climate , and financial policies , President-elect Barack Obama will have to start charting a course that defines the American economy &apos;s future direction . 
The US is not the only economy in this equation . 
We need a global vision of sustainable recovery that includes leadership from China , India , Europe , Latin America , and , yes , even Africa , long marginalized from the world economy , but very much part of it now . 
There are a few clear points amidst the large uncertainties and confusions . 
First , the US cannot continue borrowing from the rest of the world as it has for the past eight years . 
America &apos;s net exports will have to increase , meaning that the net exports of China , Japan , and other surplus countries will consequently decrease . 
The adjustments needed amount to a sizeable deficit-to-balance swing of around $ 700 billion in the US current account , or nearly 5 % of US GNP . 
China &apos;s trade surplus might shrink by half of that amount ( with cuts in trade surpluses also spread over other global regions ) , meaning a shift in Chinese GNP toward internal demand and away from net exports equal to between 5 % and 10 % of China &apos;s GNP . 
Fortunately , China is promoting a major domestic expansion . 
Second , the decline in US consumption should also be partly offset by a rise in US investment . 
However , private business will not step up investment unless there is a clear policy direction for the economy . 
Obama has emphasized the need for a &quot; green recovery , &quot; that is , one based on sustainable technologies , not merely on consumption spending . 
The US auto industry should be re-tooled for low-carbon-emission automobiles , either plug-in hybrids or pure battery-operated vehicles . 
Either technology will depend on a national electricity grid that uses low-emission forms of power generation , such as wind , solar , nuclear , or coal-fired plants that capture and store the carbon-dioxide emissions . 
All of these technologies will require public funding alongside private investment . 
Third , the US recovery will not be credible unless there is also a strategy for getting the government &apos;s own finances back in order . 
George W. Bush &apos;s idea of economic policy was to cut taxes three times while boosting spending on war . 
The result is a massive budget deficit , which will expand to gargantuan proportions in the coming year ( perhaps $ 1 trillion ) under the added weight of recession , bank bailouts , and short-term fiscal stimulus measures . 
Obama will need to put forward a medium-term fiscal plan that restores government finances . 
This will include ending the war in Iraq , raising taxes on the rich , and also gradually phasing in new consumption taxes . 
The US currently collects the lowest ratio of taxes to national income among rich nations . 
This will have to change . 
Fourth , the world &apos;s poor regions need to be seen as investment opportunities , not as threats or places to ignore . 
At a time when the major infrastructure companies of the US , Europe , and Japan will have serious excess capacity , the World Bank , the European Investment Bank , the US Export-Import Bank , the African Development Bank , and other public investment funds should be financing large-scale infrastructure spending in Africa , to build roads , power plants , ports , and telecommunications systems . 
So long as the credits are long term and carry a modest interest rate ( say , 25-year dollar loans at 5 % per annum ) , the recipient countries could repay the loans out of the significant boost in incomes that would result over the course of a generation . 
The benefits would be extraordinary , for both Africa and the rich countries , which would be putting their businesses and skilled workers back to work . 
Such loans , of course , would require a major global initiative , at a time when even blue-chip companies cannot borrow overnight , much less for 25 years ! 
In typical business cycles , countries are usually left to manage the recovery largely on their own . 
This time we will need global cooperation . 
Recovery will require major shifts in trade imbalances , technologies , and public budgets . 
These large-scale changes will have to be coordinated , at least informally if not tightly , among the major economies . 
Each should understand the basic directions of change that will be required at the national level and globally , and all nations must share in the deployment of new sustainable technologies and in the co-financing of global responsibilities , such as increased investments in African infrastructure . 
We have arrived at a moment in history when cooperative global political leadership is more important than ever . 
Fortunately , the US has taken a huge step forward with Obama &apos;s election . 
Now to action .
