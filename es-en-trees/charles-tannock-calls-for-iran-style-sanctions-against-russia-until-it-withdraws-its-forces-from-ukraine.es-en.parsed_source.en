Putin &apos;s Kampf 
BRUSSELS - Russia &apos;s seizure of Crimea is the most naked example of peacetime aggression that Europe has witnessed since Nazi Germany invaded the Sudetenland in 1938 . 
It may be fashionable to belittle the &quot; lessons of Munich , &quot; when Neville Chamberlain and Édouard Daladier appeased Hitler , deferring to his claims on Czechoslovakia . 
But if the West acquiesces to Crimea &apos;s annexation - the second time Russian President Vladimir Putin has stolen territory from a sovereign state , following Russia &apos;s seizure of Georgia &apos;s Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions in 2008 - today &apos;s democratic leaders will surely regret their inaction . 
In Western capitals , the response so far has been mixed . 
The punishments being considered - expulsion from the G-8 , for example - would be laughable were the threat to Europe &apos;s peace not so grave . 
Putin regards the breakup of the Soviet Union as the greatest catastrophe of modern times , and he has sought relentlessly to refashion Russia &apos;s lost empire . 
If the West intends to be taken seriously , it needs to act as decisively as Putin has . 
Putin &apos;s many successes in his imperial project have come virtually without cost . 
His Eurasian Economic Community has corralled energy-rich states like Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , and Turkmenistan into Russia &apos;s camp . 
Georgia was dismembered in 2008 . 
Armenia &apos;s government was bullied into spurning the European Union &apos;s offer of an Association Agreement . 
Now the greatest geostrategic prize of all - Ukraine - may fall into Putin &apos;s hands . 
Russia without Ukraine , former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote , &quot; ceases to be an empire , but Russia with Ukraine suborned and then subordinated , Russia automatically becomes an empire . &quot; 
And , because the vast majority of Ukrainians have no desire to join Putin &apos;s empire , we can be certain that the state Putin will lead from this point on will be a highly militarized one , rather like the Soviet Union but without the ruling Communist Party . 
Given the scale of Putin &apos;s adventurism , the world &apos;s response must be commensurate . 
Canceled summits , trade deals , or membership in diplomatic talking shops like the G-8 are not enough . 
Only actions that impose tangible economic sanctions that affect Russian citizens - who , after all , have voted Putin into power time and again - offer any hope of steering the Kremlin away from its expansionist course . 
Which sanctions might work ? 
First , Turkey should close the Dardanelles to Russian shipping , as it did after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War . 
Back then , Turkey closed access to the Black Sea to prevent the US from intervening , though the US , it is now clear , had no intention of doing so . 
Today , it should close the Turkish straits not only to Russian warships , but to all commercial vessels bound for Russia &apos;s Black Sea ports . 
The impact on Russia &apos;s economy - and on Putin &apos;s military pretensions - would be considerable . 
Turkey is permitted to close the Dardanelles under a 1982 amendment to the 1936 Montreux Convention . 
Indeed , Turkey could turn Putin &apos;s justification for seizing Crimea - that he is protecting ethnic Russians there - against him , by arguing that it is protecting its Turkic Tatar kin , who , given Russia &apos;s ill treatment of them in the past , are anxious to remain under Ukrainian rule . 
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu turned his plane around in mid-air this week to fly to Kyiv to offer support to the new interim government . 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , no pushover himself , as Putin well knows , should follow up on that gesture of support by immediately closing the straits to Russian shipping - until Putin recalls all troops in Crimea to their Sevastopol bases or to Russia proper . 
And Turkey should be offered an Article 5 guarantee from NATO should Russia seek to intimidate it . 
Second , US President Barack Obama should impose the type of financial sanctions on Russia that he has imposed on Iran for its nuclear program . 
Those sanctions have crippled Iran &apos;s economy . 
Similarly , denying any bank that does business with a Russian bank or company access to the US financial system would create the kind of economic chaos last seen in Russia immediately after the fall of Communism . 
Ordinary Russians should be made to understand that permitting Putin - whose primary claim to leadership is that he ended the penury of the first post-Soviet years - to continue with his imperialist aggression will cost them dearly . 
Third , Obama should emphasize to the Chinese their stake in Eurasian stability . 
Putin may regard the Soviet Union &apos;s disintegration as a tragedy , but for China it was the greatest geostrategic gift imaginable . 
At a stroke , the empire that stole millions of hectares of Chinese territory over the centuries , and that threatened the People &apos;s Republic with nuclear annihilation , simply vanished . 
Since then , Central Asia &apos;s independent states , and even Ukraine , have become important trading partners for China . 
Russia &apos;s conquests in Georgia greatly displeased China , as was seen at the post-war summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( a regional grouping that includes ex-Soviet countries that share borders with China and Russia ) . 
Russia pushed the SCO to recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia . 
But the SCO balked . 
The group &apos;s Central Asian members - Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan - would not have stood up to the Kremlin without China &apos;s support . 
Today , however , Chinese President Xi Jinping may need to be less cryptic in his response to Putin &apos;s adventurism . 
Indeed , the real test of China &apos;s claim that it is a responsible stakeholder in the world community will come soon at the United Nations . 
Will it back Putin &apos;s clear flouting of international law , or will it back Ukraine &apos;s territorial integrity ? 
There are other possible punitive measures . 
Visas can be denied and canceled for all Russian officials . 
Assets can be frozen , particularly those laundered by oligarchs close to Putin . 
Only when the pain becomes intolerable , particularly for the elite , will Putin &apos;s kampf be defeated . 
The cost of inaction is high . 
Countless countries , from Japan to Israel , rely on America &apos;s commitment to act robustly against grave breaches of the peace . 
Moreover , when Ukraine surrendered its nuclear weapons in 1994 , it did so with the express understanding that the US ( and the United Kingdom , France , and Russia ) would guarantee its territorial integrity . 
Should Crimea be annexed , no one should gainsay Ukraine if it rapidly re-nuclearized its defense ( which it retains the technological capacity to do ) . 
When Chamberlain returned from Munich , Winston Churchill said , &quot; You were given the choice between war and dishonor . 
You chose dishonor and you will have war . &quot; 
Obama and other Western leaders face a similar choice . 
And if they choose dishonor , one can be certain that an undeterred Putin will eventually give them more war .
