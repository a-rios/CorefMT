In Praise of Fragmentation 
LONDON - Emerging markets are back in the spotlight . 
Investors and banks are suddenly unwilling to finance current-account deficits with short-term debt . 
South Africa , for example , has had to increase interest rates , despite slow economic growth , to attract the funding it needs . 
Turkey &apos;s rate increase has been dramatic . 
For these and other emerging countries , 2014 may prove to be a turbulent year . 
If volatility becomes extreme , some countries may consider imposing constraints on capital outflows , which the International Monetary Fund now agrees might be useful in specific circumstances . 
But the fundamental question is how to manage the impact of short-term capital inflows . 
Until recently , economic orthodoxy considered that question invalid . 
But empirical support for the benefits of capital-account liberalization is weak . 
The most successful development stories in economic history - Japan and South Korea - featured significant domestic financial repression and capital controls , which accompanied several decades of rapid growth . 
Likewise , most cross-country studies have found no evidence that capital-account liberalization is good for growth . 
As the economist Jagdish Bhagwati pointed out 16 years ago in his article &quot; The Capital Myth , &quot; there are fundamental differences between trade in widgets and trade in dollars . 
The case for liberalizing trade in goods and services is strong ; the case for complete capital-account liberalization is not . 
One reason is that many modern financial flows do not play the useful role in capital allocation that economic theory assumes . 
Before World War I , capital flowed in one direction : from rich countries with excess savings , such as the United Kingdom , to countries like Australia or Argentina , whose investment needs exceeded domestic savings . 
But in today &apos;s world , net capital flows are often from relatively poor countries to rich countries . 
Huge two-way gross capital flows are driven by transient changes in perception , with carry-trade opportunities ( borrowing in low-yielding currencies to finance lending in high-yielding ones ) replacing long-term capital investment . 
Moreover , capital inflows frequently finance consumption or unsustainable real-estate booms . 
And yet , despite the growing evidence to the contrary , the assumption that all capital flows are beneficial has proved remarkably resilient . 
That reflects the power not only of vested interests but also of established ideas . 
Empirical falsification of a prevailing orthodoxy is disturbing . 
It is time to stop looking for these non-existent benefits , and to distinguish among different categories of capital flows . 
Some are valuable , but some are potentially harmful . 
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , for example , can aid growth , because it is long term , involves investment in the real economy , and is often accompanied by technology or skill transfers . 
Equity portfolio investment may involve price volatility as ownership positions change , but at least it implies a permanent commitment of capital to a business enterprise . 
Long-term debt finance of real capital investment can play a useful role as well . 
By contrast , short-term capital flows , particularly if provided by banks that are themselves relying on short-term funding , can create instability risks , while bringing few benefits . 
What is less clear is the best policy response . 
Capital controls are invariably porous , and we cannot gain the benefits of free trade and FDI without creating some opportunities for short-term investor positioning . 
China has not liberalized its capital account , but short-term inflows are now driving stronger upward pressure on the renminbi ( and larger offsetting reserve accumulation by the People &apos;s Bank of China ) than can be explained by the current-account surplus and FDI flows . 
A case can thus be made for capital-account liberalization that is based on the impossibility of effective control , not on any supposed benefits . 
But while perfect policy is unattainable , partly effective controls can still play a useful role if targeted at the interface between short-term inflows and domestic credit cycles . 
After all , capital inflows cause the greatest harm when they drive rapid increases in credit-financed consumption or real-estate speculation . 
The required policy response should integrate domestic financial regulation with capital-account management . 
Tax instruments and reserve requirements that put sand in the wheels of short-term capital inflows should be combined with strong countercyclical measures , such as additional capital requirements , to slow domestic credit creation . 
The effectiveness of such measures can be undermined if global banks operate in emerging countries in branch form , providing domestic credit financed by global funding pools . 
But this danger can be countered by requiring banks to operate as legally incorporated subsidiaries , with locally regulated capital and liquidity reserves , and strong regulatory limits on the maturity of their funding . 
Such requirements would not prevent useful capital flows : global banking groups could invest equity in emerging markets and fund their subsidiaries &quot; balance sheets with long-term debt . 
In banking , as in other sectors , investment that combines long-term commitment with skill transfer can be highly beneficial , which implies that foreign banks should be free to compete on the same basis as domestic banks . 
Neither mandatory subsidiarization nor tax- or regulation-based capital controls will solve all of the problems . 
Much of the financial industry resists such measures , as do the many economists who remain wedded to the old orthodoxy . 
In the past , policymakers have been at pains to stress that no such fragmentation will be allowed . 
But we need to be blunt : Free flows of short-term debt can result in capital misallocation and harmful instability . 
When it comes to global capital markets , fragmentation can be a good thing .
