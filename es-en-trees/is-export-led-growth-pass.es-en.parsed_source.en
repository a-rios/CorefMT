Is Export Led Growth Pass√© ? 
CAMBRIDGE - For five decades , developing countries that managed to develop competitive export industries have been rewarded with astonishing growth rates : Taiwan and South Korea in the 1960 &quot; s , Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore in the 1970 &quot; s , China in the 1980 &quot; s , and eventually India in the 1990 &quot; s . 
In all these cases , and a few others - also mostly in Asia - domestic reforms would surely have produced growth regardless of international trade . 
But it is difficult to see how the resulting growth could have been as high - reaching an unprecedented 10 % or more annually in per-capita terms - without a global economy able to absorb these countries &quot; exports . 
Many countries are trying to emulate this growth model , but rarely as successfully because the domestic preconditions often remain unfulfilled . 
Turn to world markets without pro-active policies to ensure competence in some modern manufacturing or service industry , and you are likely to remain an impoverished exporter of natural resources and labor-intensive products such as garments . 
Nevertheless , developing countries have been falling over each other to establish export zones and subsidize assembly operations of multinational enterprises . 
The lesson is clear : export-led growth is the way to go . 
But for how long ? 
While reading the economic tea leaves is always risky , there are signs that we are at the cusp of a transition to a new regime in which the rules of the game will not be nearly as accommodating for export-led strategies . 
The most immediate threat is the slowdown in the advanced economies . 
Europe and the United States are both entering recession , and fears are mounting that the financial meltdown accompanying the sub-prime mortgage debacle has not worked itself out . 
All this is happening at a time when inflationary pressures hamper the usual monetary and fiscal remedies . 
The European Central Bank , tightly focused on price stability , has been raising interest rates , and the US Federal Reserve may soon follow suit . 
So the advanced economies will suffer for a while , with obvious implications for the demand for exports from emerging markets . 
On top of this is the almost certain unwinding of global current-account imbalances . 
Emerging markets and developing countries ran a surplus of $ 631 billion in 2007 , split roughly equally between Asian countries and the oil-exporting states . 
This amounts to 4.2 % of their collective GDP . 
The US alone ran a current-account deficit of $ 739 billion ( 5.3 % of its GDP ) . 
Neither the economics nor the politics of this pattern of current-account balances is sustainable , especially in a recessionary environment . 
The politics is clear to see . 
Nothing works as potently to inflame protectionist sentiment as large trade deficits . 
According to a December 2007 NBC / Wall Street Journal poll , almost 60 % of Americans think globalization is bad because it has subjected US firms and workers to unfair competition . 
If globalization has acquired a lousy reputation in the US , the external deficit deserves much of the blame . 
US trade policy has been remarkably resistant to protectionist pressure in recent years . 
But , regardless of who wins America &apos;s presidency , the world should expect closer scrutiny of imports from China and other low-cost countries as well as of outsourcing of services to places like India . 
As the US and other advanced economies become less hospitable to developing-country exports , rapidly growing emerging markets , help as they may , are unlikely to take up the slack and thus provide ample fuel for export-led growth . 
Import tariffs tend to be higher in developing countries , making it more difficult to gain access to them . 
Moreover , developing countries compete in similar products - consumer goods of varying levels of sophistication - so that the politics of expanded South-South trade looks even worse than the politics of North-South trade . 
Anti-dumping action against imports from China , Vietnam , and other Asian exporters is already commonplace in developing countries . 
So exporting will become an even tougher business . 
Countries like China that have large surpluses will have to rely much more on domestic demand to fuel their economies . 
This is not all bad , because China can certainly use more public investment in social sectors such as health and education . 
But the impact will extend beyond the surplus countries . 
If exporters from Brazil , Turkey , South Africa , and Mexico - all deficit economies - were already struggling to compete with China in third markets when those markets were wide open and expanding rapidly , imagine how they will fare under less hospitable conditions . 
The impact on growth will almost certainly be negative , even if domestic demand compensates fully for the decline in external demand . 
The reason is microeconomic , not macroeconomic : you can sell only so much steel or auto parts at home , and labor productivity in service industries does not match that of export-oriented activities . 
So shrinking export markets will slow down growth-promoting structural change at home . 
None of this implies a disaster for developing countries . 
Long-term success still depends on what happens at home rather than abroad . 
What is moderately bad news at the moment will become terrible news only if economic distress in the advanced countries - especially the US - is allowed to morph into xenophobia and all-out protectionism ; if large emerging markets such as China , India , and Brazil fail to realize that they have become too important to free ride on global economic governance ; and if , as a consequence , others overreact by turning their back on the world economy and pursue autarkic policies . 
Absent these missteps , expect a tougher ride on the global economy , but not a calamity .
