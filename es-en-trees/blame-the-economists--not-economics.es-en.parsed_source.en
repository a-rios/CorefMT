Blame the Economists , Not Economics 
CAMBRIDGE - As the world economy tumbles off the edge of a precipice , critics of the economics profession are raising questions about its complicity in the current crisis . 
Rightly so : economists have plenty to answer for . 
It was economists who legitimized and popularized the view that unfettered finance was a boon to society . 
They spoke with near unanimity when it came to the &quot; dangers of government over-regulation . &quot; 
Their technical expertise - or what seemed like it at the time -gave them a privileged position as opinion makers , as well as access to the corridors of power . 
Very few among them ( notable exceptions including Nouriel Roubini and Robert Shiller ) raised alarm bells about the crisis to come . 
Perhaps worse still , the profession has failed to provide helpful guidance in steering the world economy out of its current mess . 
On Keynesian fiscal stimulus , economists &quot; views range from &quot; absolutely essential &quot; to &quot; ineffective and harmful . &quot; 
On re-regulating finance , there are plenty of good ideas , but little convergence . 
From the near-consensus on the virtues of a finance-centric model of the world , the economics profession has moved to a near-total absence of consensus on what ought to be done . 
So is economics in need of a major shake-up ? 
Should we burn our existing textbooks and rewrite them from scratch ? 
Actually , no . 
Without recourse to the economist &apos;s toolkit , we cannot even begin to make sense of the current crisis . 
Why , for example , did China &apos;s decision to accumulate foreign reserves result in a mortgage lender in Ohio taking excessive risks ? 
If your answer does not use elements from behavioral economics , agency theory , information economics , and international economics , among others , it is likely to remain seriously incomplete . 
The fault lies not with economics , but with economists . 
The problem is that economists ( and those who listen to them ) became over-confident in their preferred models of the moment : markets are efficient , financial innovation transfers risk to those best able to bear it , self-regulation works best , and government intervention is ineffective and harmful . 
They forgot that there were many other models that led in radically different directions . 
Hubris creates blind spots . 
If anything needs fixing , it is the sociology of the profession . 
The textbooks - at least those used in advanced courses - are fine . 
Non-economists tend to think of economics as a discipline that idolizes markets and a narrow concept of ( allocative ) efficiency . 
If the only economics course you take is the typical introductory survey , or if you are a journalist asking an economist for a quick opinion on a policy issue , that is indeed what you will encounter . 
But take a few more economics courses , or spend some time in advanced seminar rooms , and you will get a different picture . 
Labor economists focus not only on how trade unions can distort markets , but also how , under certain conditions , they can enhance productivity . 
Trade economists study the implications of globalization on inequality within and across countries . 
Finance theorists have written reams on the consequences of the failure of the &quot; efficient markets &quot; hypothesis . 
Open-economy macroeconomists examine the instabilities of international finance . 
Advanced training in economics requires learning about market failures in detail , and about the myriad ways in which governments can help markets work better . 
Macroeconomics may be the only applied field within economics in which more training puts greater distance between the specialist and the real world , owing to its reliance on highly unrealistic models that sacrifice relevance to technical rigor . 
Sadly , in view of today &apos;s needs , macroeconomists have made little progress on policy since John Maynard Keynes explained how economies could get stuck in unemployment due to deficient aggregate demand . 
Some , like Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman , would say that the field has actually regressed . 
Economics is really a toolkit with multiple models - each a different , stylized representation of some aspect of reality . 
One &apos;s skill as an economist depends on the ability to pick and choose the right model for the situation . 
Economics &quot; richness has not been reflected in public debate because economists have taken far too much license . 
Instead of presenting menus of options and listing the relevant trade-offs - which is what economics is about - economists have too often conveyed their own social and political preferences . 
Instead of being analysts , they have been ideologues , favoring one set of social arrangements over others . 
Furthermore , economists have been reluctant to share their intellectual doubts with the public , lest they &quot; empower the barbarians . &quot; 
No economist can be entirely sure that his preferred model is correct . 
But when he and others advocate it to the exclusion of alternatives , they end up communicating a vastly exaggerated degree of confidence about what course of action is required . 
Paradoxically , then , the current disarray within the profession is perhaps a better reflection of the profession &apos;s true value added than its previous misleading consensus . 
Economics can at best clarify the choices for policy makers ; it cannot make those choices for them . 
When economists disagree , the world gets exposed to legitimate differences of views on how the economy operates . 
It is when they agree too much that the public should beware .
