Latin America &apos;s Middle-Class Mirage 
BUENOS AIRES - Rising incomes across the developing world will bring some 400 million people into the middle class by 2020 , up from 1.8 billion today . 
Their increasing spending power , especially on non-essential consumer goods and services , is being hailed as the great hope for the global economy . 
But closer examination of their economic circumstances suggests that these new consumers are neither as wealthy nor as secure as we may think . 
The vast majority of the middle-class expansion is taking place in emerging Asia . 
But a similar socioeconomic shift in Latin America holds important lessons for rapidly growing markets everywhere . 
Latin Amercia &apos;s middle class grew by around 50 % , to 152 million , from 2003 to 2009 , accounting for around 30 % of the continent &apos;s population - a proportion that undoubtedly has grown since . 
This remarkable economic transformation has been presented as proof of successful pro-growth policies pursued in previous decades . 
Higher employment , rising wages , cash transfers to the poor , and state pensions have all helped to fuel progress . 
But , while policies that reduced the atrocious poverty and narrowed the yawning income inequality that persisted throughout the 1990 &quot; s must surely be applauded , the welfare gains associated with this performance may prove to be weaker than hoped . 
An obvious problem lies in the fact that we measure the size of the middle class according to household-income data , but with little knowledge about these households &quot; patterns of saving . 
If today &apos;s higher incomes are consumed and tomorrow &apos;s incomes decline ( which is likely if the economy slows ) , middle-class households with no savings buffer could easily slip back into poverty . 
And , as a recent World Bank report ( which I co-authored with Augusto de la Torre ) pointed out , although data on household wealth are sparse , surveys suggest that low- and middle- income families , especially in Brazil and Argentina , tend to buy depreciating assets such as cars and televisions , rather than invest in houses . 
Such households are especially vulnerable if their purchases are financed by credit . 
Nor do transfer payments or higher pensions provide much of a sustainable basis for spending . 
Almost every social-security system in the region is losing money . 
A declining proportion of paid benefits are covered by workers &quot; contributions , and few countries are saving enough to bridge the deficits . 
Eventually , the books must be balanced , and this will probably happen at the expense of future social spending . 
Another , perhaps more important reason not to celebrate is that higher incomes do not necessarily translate into a better quality of life . 
A large part of household consumption includes public-sector goods and services . 
The same new middle-class worker who now enjoys a higher real income also endures a two-hour daily commute on packed and hazardous trains or buses , purchases private health insurance to escape the long lines in under-resourced hospitals , and pays for private education for their children to avoid decrepit school buildings operated by a strike-prone public-education system . 
To some extent , poor public services can be seen as the flipside of the middle-class consumer boom in emerging economies . 
State subsidies and transfers have boosted private incomes , but often at the expense of investment in transport , security , and utilities . 
In short , there is a difference between a society with a growing middle class and a middle-class society . 
This might seem an obvious shortcoming that governments would readily sort out . 
But there are political reasons why they do not . 
Voters tend to credit increases in minimum wages , pensions , and social transfers to the government that provides them . 
By contrast , the benefits of public investments are slower to be felt , and their beneficiaries are more diffuse . 
Politicians operating on short electoral cycles inevitably target public spending at potential supporters . 
But , as societies become richer , the demands of the electorate become more nuanced . 
When disenchanted middle-class voters take to the streets , Latin America &apos;s leaders will have to explain to them why better schools and trains tomorrow require saving more today .
