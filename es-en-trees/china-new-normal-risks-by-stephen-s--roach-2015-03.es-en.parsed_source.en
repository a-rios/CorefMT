China &apos;s New Normal and America &apos;s Old Habits 
NEW HAVEN - China is generating a lot of confusion nowadays , both at home , where senior officials now tout the economy &apos;s &quot; new normal , &quot; and abroad , exemplified by America &apos;s embrace of Cold War-style tactics to contain China &apos;s rise . 
On both counts , the disconnects are striking , adding a new dimension of risk to the impact of the &quot; China factor &quot; on a fragile world . 
The official view in China is that its economy has already arrived in the Promised Land of the &quot; new normal . &quot; 
Indeed , that was the theme of the just-concluded China Development Forum ( CDF ) - an important platform for debate among China &apos;s senior officials and a broad cross-section of international participants that occurs immediately after the annual National People &apos;s Congress . 
Since the CDF &apos;s inception in 2000 , the Chinese government has used the event to signal its policy priorities . 
In 2002 , for example , the CDF focused on the impact of China &apos;s accession to the World Trade Organization - a precursor to a spectacular surge of export-led growth . 
In 2009 , the emphasis was on China &apos;s aggressive post-crisis stimulus strategy . 
And last year &apos;s event addressed implementation of the so-called Third Plenum reforms . 
This suggests that China &apos;s &quot; new normal &quot; will be the government &apos;s top priority this year . 
But there remains considerable ambiguity as to what exactly the new normal entails - or whether it has even been achieved . 
Yet , at the CDF &apos;s wrap-up session , Premier Li Keqiang suggested , a bit less decisively , that China is basically following the world economy in its transition to a new normal . 
In short , China &apos;s government is confusing a path with the final destination - a point that I stressed in my remarks to the CDF , in which I argued that China is in the early stages of rebalancing its economy toward services and consumption . 
In fact , China is far from settling in to a new normal . 
The best way to measure how far China still has to go is to consider the development of its services sector - the infrastructure of consumer demand in an economy . 
The good news is that services are now growing faster than any other sector , having reached 48 % of GDP in 2014 ( thus surpassing the end-2015 target of 47 % well ahead of schedule ) . 
The tough news is that this remains significantly lower than the 60-65 % share typical of a more &quot; normal &quot; economy . 
Given this , it is worrying that China &apos;s leaders believe that the new normal is already at hand . 
The notion that this critical transition has occurred risks generating complacency at a time when China should be focused on the wrenching , but essential , process of structural adjustment - one that will take at least another decade to complete . 
Continuing the shift to a services-led growth model is important for a number of reasons . 
With services in China employing 30 % more workers per unit of output than manufacturing and construction , the sector &apos;s expansion will help to preserve social stability , even as economic growth slows to 7 % . 
Observers in the West , focused largely on the slowdown of headline GDP growth , continue to miss this key point . 
Moreover , because the services sector also requires fewer commodities and less energy , this transition will help China address its serious environmental problems . 
In the meantime , China faces another , equally daunting challenge : the United States &quot; growing determination to contain its growing influence . 
At this year &apos;s CDF , tensions between the hegemon and the rising power were widely discussed , both in the formal sessions and on the sidelines . 
Three developments were especially noteworthy : US resistance to China &apos;s efforts to establish the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank - a stance now rejected by most of America &apos;s closest allies ; 
Combined with ongoing disputes over cyber security and territorial claims in the East and South China Seas - not to mention questions about America &apos;s geostrategic &quot; pivot &quot; toward Asia - these issues have chilled the Sino-American relationship . 
It fell to Henry Kissinger , who was present at the dawn of the modern US-China relationship , to put it all into context . 
At the CDF , he stressed how different the situation is now , compared to 1972 , when he and then-President Richard Nixon first met with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai . 
Unlike the immediate military threats back then , today &apos;s challenges - such as climate change , cyber security , and global health - can be addressed only through collaborative strategic engagement . 
The imperative to cooperate is an inevitable outgrowth of globalization . 
As Kissinger emphasized , the Middle Kingdom of China &apos;s dynastic era knew nothing of the Roman Empire , and vice versa . 
In today &apos;s world , however , no great power can afford to operate in a vacuum . 
They receive instantaneous feedback from one another - especially on shared challenges - whether they like it or not . 
In a sense , it is no surprise that the US is bristling over China &apos;s ascendance . 
After all , dominant powers have always struggled to cope with rising ones . 
Nonetheless , China , burdened by 150 years of perceived humiliation by the West , does not take kindly to that reaction . 
As China confronts the challenges of its economy &apos;s shift to a new normal , it will need to find common ground with the US . 
Both countries will have to show leadership , vision , and openness to collaborative engagement . 
Sadly , there was little sign of that at this year &apos;s CDF .
