Asia &apos;s Resource Scramble 
NEW DELHI - Competition for strategic natural resources - including water , mineral ores , and fossil fuels - has always played a significant role in shaping the terms of the international economic and political order . 
But now that competition has intensified , as it encompasses virtually all of Asia , where growing populations and rapid economic development over the last three decades have generated an insatiable appetite for severely limited supplies of key commodities . 
Asia is the world &apos;s most resource-poor continent , and overexploitation of the natural resources that it does possess has created an environmental crisis that is contributing to regional climate change . 
For example , the Tibetan Plateau , which contains the world &apos;s third-largest store of ice , is warming at almost twice the average global rate , owing to the rare convergence of high altitudes and low latitudes - with potentially serious consequences for Asia &apos;s freshwater supply . 
In other words , three interconnected crises - a resource crisis , an environmental crisis , and a climate crisis - are threatening Asia &apos;s economic , social , and ecological future . 
Population growth , urbanization , and industrialization are exacerbating resource-related stresses , with some cities experiencing severe water shortages , and degrading the environment ( as anyone who has experienced Beijing &apos;s smog can attest ) . 
Fossil-fuel and water subsidies have contributed to both problems . 
Faced with severe supply constraints , Asian economies are increasingly tapping other continents &quot; fossil fuels , mineral ores , and timber . 
But water is extremely difficult - and prohibitively expensive - to import . 
And Asia has less fresh water per person than any continent other than Antarctica , and some of the world &apos;s worst water pollution . 
Likewise , food scarcity is a growing problem for Asian countries , with crop yields and overall food production growing more slowly than demand . 
At the same time , rising incomes are altering people &apos;s diets , which now include more animal-based proteins , further compounding Asia &apos;s food challenges . 
The intensifying competition over natural resources among Asian countries is shaping resource geopolitics , including the construction of oil and gas pipelines . 
China has managed to secure new hydrocarbon supplies through pipelines from Kazakhstan and Russia . 
But this option is not available to Asia &apos;s other leading economies - Japan , India , and South Korea - which are not contiguous with suppliers in Central Asia , Iran , or Russia . 
These countries will remain dependent on oil imports from an increasingly unstable Persian Gulf . 
Furthermore , China &apos;s fears that hostile naval forces could hold its economy hostage by interdicting its oil imports have prompted it to build a massive oil reserve , and to plan two strategic energy corridors in southern Asia . 
The corridors will provide a more direct transport route for oil and liquefied gas from Africa and the Persian Gulf , while minimizing exposure to sea-lanes policed by the United States Navy . 
One such corridor extends 800 kilometers from the Bay of Bengal across Burma to southern China . 
In addition to gas pipelines - the first is scheduled to be completed this year - it will include a high-speed railroad and a highway from the Burmese coast to China &apos;s Yunnan province , offering China &apos;s remote interior provinces an outlet to the sea for the first time . 
The other corridor - work on which has been delayed , owing to an insurrection in Pakistan &apos;s Baluchistan province - will stretch from the Chinese-operated port at Gwadar , near Pakistan &apos;s border with Iran , through the Karakoram mountains to the landlocked , energy-producing Xinjiang province . 
Notably , in giving China control of its strategic Gwadar port in February , Pakistan has permitted the Chinese government to build a naval base there . 
Given the significant role that natural resources have historically played in global strategic relations - including driving armed interventions and full-scale wars - increasingly murky resource geopolitics threatens to exacerbate existing tensions among Asian countries . 
Rising dependence on energy imports has already been used to rationalize an increased emphasis on maritime power , raising new concerns about sea-lane safety and vulnerability to supply disruptions . 
This partly explains the current tensions between China and Japan over their conflicting territorial claims to islands in the East China Sea , which occupy an area of only seven square kilometers , but are surrounded by rich hydrocarbon reserves . 
Disputes in the South China Sea involving China and five of its neighbors , and in southern Asia , are equally resource-driven . 
While strategic competition for resources will continue to shape Asia &apos;s security dynamics , the associated risks can be moderated if Asia &apos;s leaders establish norms and institutions aimed at building rule-based cooperation . 
Unfortunately , little progress has been made in this area . 
For example , 53 of Asia &apos;s 57 transnational river basins lack any water-sharing or cooperative arrangement . 
Indeed , Asia is one of only two continents , along with Africa , where regional integration has yet to take hold , largely because political and cultural diversity , together with historical animosities , have hindered institution-building . 
Strained political relations among most of Asia &apos;s sub-regions make a region-wide security structure or more effective resource cooperation difficult to achieve . 
This could have significant implications for Asia &apos;s ostensibly unstoppable rise - and thus for the West &apos;s supposedly inevitable decline . 
After all , Asian economies cannot sustain their impressive economic growth without addressing their resource , environmental , and security challenges - and no single country can do it alone .
