Vladimir Putin &apos;s Potemkin Nation 
MOSCOW - &quot; Image is everything &quot; might be a viable credo if you are the house of Gucci or a catwalk model , but it is definitely not appropriate as a national strategy . 
Yet &quot; Putinism , &quot; the ruling ideology of the Russia that Vladimir Putin has forged during his ten years in power , is all about image - the image of a reconstituted great power restored to the world stage . 
The problem is that , unlike the rail thin catwalk model who starves herself half to death to stay slim , the image of Russia that Putin seeks to project is completely imaginary . 
The Russian economy is a shambles , and Russia &apos;s mighty military had to exert itself to its fullest to vanquish tiny Georgia in 2008 . 
Of course , Russia &apos;s rulers have usually preferred myth to reality . 
After all , it was during the reign of Catherine the Great that the &quot; Potemkin village &quot; was invented , whereby the squalor of the lives of Catherine &apos;s serfs was hidden behind cheerfully painted housing façades as the Empress toured her country . 
In today &apos;s Russia , the overriding myth is that Putin has presided over a rapidly modernizing country . 
Here the cheerful façade is composed of Russia &apos;s miniature president , Dmitri Medvedev , whose job - like that of the American First Lady - is to keep up appearances . 
And the appearance that needs the most maintenance is that of a modern and civilized Russia . 
Upon assuming the presidency in 2008 , Medvedev proclaimed : &quot; We must achieve a true respect for law , and overcome the legal nihilism that is hampering modern development . &quot; And , in a much discussed newspaper article entitled &quot; Russia Forward , &quot; he declared , &quot; Should we continue to drag into the future our primitive raw-materials economy , endemic corruption , and inveterate habit of relying on the state to solve our problems ? 
Today , for the first time in our history , we have a chance to prove to ourselves and the world that Russia can develop democratically . 
Our political system will be extremely open , flexible . &quot; 
And , just this October , remembering the victims of Stalin , Medvedev wrote in his blog ( itself a sign meant to convey how up-to-date he is ) , &quot; We can hear voices saying that those numerous deaths were justified by some supreme goals of the state . 
I am convinced that no development of a country , no success or ambitions , can be achieved through human grief and losses . 
Nothing can be valued above human life , and there is no excuse for repressions . &quot; 
Of course , if Medvedev actually meant what he says , he would be leading the opposition to the Russian state that Putin has built . 
But , since Putin put Medvedev in his job and can remove him anytime he pleases , Russia &apos;s president is not opposed to the ways of the Putin regime . 
So what is going on here ? 
Putin &apos;s political genius is that he understands that , for Russians , being perceived as powerful is even more important than actually being powerful . 
He does not need to modernize Russia so that it can actually compete with the world &apos;s mightiest powers ; he just needs to bluster enough that people - particularly his own - believe that Russia is once again among the first rank of nations . 
Putin &apos;s promise to restore national self-respect , shattered by Russia &apos;s bitter loss of superpower status in 1991 , is centered around cowing Europe into submissively accepting Russia &apos;s sphere of &quot; privileged interest &quot; in the post-Soviet nations . 
By increasing oil and gas prices , or limiting supplies , flexing its military muscles in Georgia , or sending ships to Cuba and Venezuela to parade Russia &apos;s power on the world stage , Putin has convinced many people that Russia is back . 
Moreover , Putin &apos;s project to safeguard &quot; great Russian statehood &quot; from the disarray of the post-Soviet era has seen the imprisoning of &quot; dishonest &quot; oligarchs ; the prosecution of an &quot; irresponsible &quot; press ; and the establishment of his personal dictatorship over the rule of law . 
Because the world associates these traits with the Soviet era , many people mistake their reappearance as a sign that Russian power is now approaching that of the USSR . 
Nothing could be farther from the truth . 
As in the Soviet era , the dictatorial mask disguises the system &apos;s economic and political fragility . 
Thus , instead of investing in the energy industry - the lifeblood of the economy - in order to reverse declining output , the Kremlin is devoting its energy to a presidential commission to &quot; counteract attempts to falsify history to the detriment of Russia &apos;s interests . &quot; 
This means that the state will decide which interpretations of history should be considered &quot; true , &quot; creating endless opportunities for manipulation to serve the agenda of those in power . 
Likewise , instead of welcoming the sort of foreign investors who can modernize the economy , the regime continues to wage its judicial war against Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev of Yukos Oil . 
They were convicted for financial crimes in a 2004 trial , but in August faced a fresh round of charges , including tax evasion and embezzlement . 
Journalists and human rights activists and lawyers - Anna Politkovskaya , Stanislav Markelov , Anastasia Baburova , Natalia Estemirova , and dozens of others - are murdered , and no one in the Kremlin seems to mind , because they are not really a part of the New Russia that Putin is building . 
Indeed , just this November , Sergei Magnitsky , a lawyer for Hermitage Capital Management , died in prison because of his captors &quot; negligence . 
Perhaps US Vice President Joe Biden summed up Russia &apos;s predicament best : &quot; The reality is , the Russians are where they are , having a shrinking population base , a withering economy , and a banking structure that is unlikely to withstand the next 15 years . 
The world &apos;s changing before them and they &apos;re clinging to something in the past that &apos;s not sustainable . &quot; 
So long as the façade holds , Russians will continue to cling to Putin &apos;s illusion of power .
