El Salvador &apos;s Democratic Test 
Back in his radical days , Ken Livingstone , the former mayor of London , famously quipped that if voting changed anything , they would abolish it . 
It turns out that in Latin America , elections really do shake things up . 
The latest proof : Mauricio Funes , the standard bearer of the FMLN - until not long ago a Marxist guerilla movement - has just prevailed in El Salvador &apos;s presidential election . 
This is remarkable in a country that for as long as anyone remembers has been ruled , by hook or by crook , by a reactionary oligarchy . 
If the Salvadoran left &apos;s close electoral victory is peacefully accepted - as it has been so far - it means that Latin America has truly come a long way . 
Whether this profound change will be seen as a key moment in the consolidation of democracy in El Salvador , or as the beginning of a slide toward instability , will depend on Mr Funes &quot; ability to balance two complex and contradictory imperatives : calling for moderation across the political spectrum while implementing the deep social transformations that El Salvador sorely needs . 
With nearly half the population below the poverty line , the country &apos;s pervasive inequalities underlie its tumultuous political history , soaring crime levels , and massive outward migration . 
By all accounts a reasonable man , Funes faces an uphill battle in preaching moderation . 
He will preside over a deeply polarized country , where conservative forces find themselves outside the presidential palace for the first time ever . 
If the vicious tone of his opponent &apos;s campaign offers any indication , Funes cannot count on the good will of those who have yet to learn how to behave like a loyal opposition . 
More important , perhaps , is the new president &apos;s relationship with his own allies . 
A political newcomer who did not participate in El Salvador &apos;s civil war , Funes , along with all the FMLN &apos;s congressional candidates , was handpicked as presidential nominee , behind closed doors by the party &apos;s Political Commission , where diehard Marxist cadres still roam unchecked . 
The allegiance of the FMLN &apos;s congressional caucus lies primarily with the party &apos;s traditional structure and only accidentally with Funes . 
Even more forbidding are the constraints that Funes faces in pursuing a social reform agenda . 
To begin with , the FMLN is short of a congressional majority , which remains in the hands of its right-wing opponents , ARENA and its long-time allies , the small PCN . 
Funes &quot; administration seems to be doomed to political gridlock , a chronic ailment of Latin America &apos;s presidential regimes . 
Moreover , the current economic downturn is creating especially severe problems for the Salvadoran economy . 
Remittances from the United States accounted for roughly 17 % of GDP in 2008 , more than the country &apos;s total exports . 
This vital source of capital is falling at an alarming rate - 8.4 % year on year in January . 
Unsurprisingly , El Salvador &apos;s economic growth forecast for 2009 has been cut to barely 1 % . 
The real problem , however , is less the economic contraction than the very limited room for maneuver that the government enjoys in a country that dollarized its economy in 2001 . 
In the face of plummeting remittances and foreign investment , Funes will rapidly discover that dollarization without dollars is no fun . 
Funes is a moderate voice in a country where there are few of them . 
He needs all the help he can get . 
The US , which still has significant clout over what happens in El Salvador , would do well to welcome his election and offer him tangible support for key social reforms . 
The stakes are high . 
Confronted with daunting obstacles and a disloyal opposition , Funes may well decide to cater to FMLN hard-liners and pursue his reform agenda with no patience for democratic checks and balances , as other leftist leaders in Latin America , such as Ecuador &apos;s Rafael Correa and Bolivia &apos;s Evo Morales , have done . 
For Funes , choosing that path would be a historic mistake . 
It would endanger the single most important - if slightly ironic - legacy of the FMLN &apos;s armed struggle : the creation of a liberal democracy in El Salvador . 
Democracy is a priceless bequest . 
If , amidst the indifference of the world , Funes chose to play fast and loose with it , Livingstone would be proven wrong : voting can change much , and sometimes for the worse .
