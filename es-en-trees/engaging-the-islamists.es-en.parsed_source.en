Engaging the Islamists 
The massive victory of Hamas in the Palestinian parliamentary elections stunned much of the world , but the outcome should not have been so surprising . 
Indeed , Hamas &apos;s moment of triumph is part of a growing regional pattern . 
Four years ago , Turkey &apos;s Islamic-oriented Justice and Development Party won a plurality in parliamentary elections and formed a government . 
A month later , a similarly named Islamic party in Morocco , Parti de la Justice et du Development ( PJD ) , finished third in legislative elections . 
Last December , the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt ( legally banned since 1954 ) scored equally impressive results , garnering 20 % of the popular vote and 88 seats in the Parliament , making it the main opposition bloc to Mubarak &apos;s ruling National Democratic Party ( NDP ) . 
Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shiite parties in Iraq have also performed well in elections . 
Despite this democratic endorsement , most Western governments have been reluctant to engage with these parties or to prepare for Islamists coming to power through the ballot box . 
The irony is obvious : Islamists , who seem suspicious of democracy as a Western plot , took President George W. Bush &apos;s promotion of democracy in the Muslim world more seriously than America &apos;s autocratic friends - and possibly more seriously than Bush himself . 
In his first press conference after Hamas &apos;s victory , Bush was visibly at a loss for words in responding to this &quot; unexpected development . &quot; 
The truth is that over the last three years , some regional insiders , including me , had several lengthy discussions with Bush &apos;s advisors on the National Security Council ( NSC ) and in the State Department . 
We urged the Bush administration to formulate a consistent policy that engages the region &apos;s Islamists who are willing to rule by democratic principles . 
Some of this debate was widely publicized . 
Part of America &apos;s reluctance to deal with Islamists reflected concern over the reaction of autocratic regimes , some of which are long-time allies . 
This fear proved not only unwarranted , but also counterproductive , for it has not stopped the march of the Islamists in the Arab Middle East . 
Now it is time for a fresh and bold approach toward all contending political forces in the Muslim world . 
First , America and the West must stop supporting autocrats with aid , trade , and arms . 
Second , there must be a push to expand the public space for the Muslim world &apos;s democrats , so free media and independent judiciaries to protect press freedom need to be boosted . 
Third , an active dialogue that engages the Islamists , no matter how difficult , must begin and continue . 
The West needs to establish clear and consistent rules of engagement . 
It is legitimate and imperative to make resumption of aid to Palestinians contingent on Hamas &apos;s recognition of Israel &apos;s right to exist and on its commitment to all international agreements previously signed by the PLO and the Palestinian Authority . 
In an earlier step toward recognition by the world community , the PLO had to revamp the Palestinian Covenant , which called for the destruction of Israel . 
There is no reason why Hamas would not follow that precedent , if the demand to do so were made relentlessly . 
In fact , all militant liberation movements have renounced violence in due time , from the IRA to the Sandinistas to the African National Congress . 
Likewise , Israel must reciprocate every gesture of good will from Hamas , however psychologically difficult this may be . 
After all , in 1947 similar Jewish &quot; freedom fighters &quot; blew up the King David Hotel , killing tens of British officers . 
Until the 1970 &quot; s , these Zionist guerillas were wanted as terrorists by British authorities . 
Then one of them , Menachem Begin , was elected Prime Minister of Israel and became a partner in peace with Egypt &apos;s President Anwar Sadat . 
Sadat himself was a suspected terrorist , according to Egyptian authorities , for having plotted and taken part in assassinating a prominent political figure . 
But both Sadat and Begin became respected worldwide for taking risks for peace and won a joint Nobel Peace prize . 
So , for Hamas as well as for America , the West , and Israel , it is futile to look back in anger and frustration . 
Instead , they all should look forward to creating anew the more positive legacies of Sadat , Begin , Rabin , and even Ariel Sharon . 
If those leaders could disavow their own violent pasts and take practical steps toward peace in the region , why can &apos;t Hamas ?
