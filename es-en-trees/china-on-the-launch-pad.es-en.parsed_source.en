China on the Launch Pad 
SINGAPORE - Behind a veil of secrecy , China &apos;s development of strategic and tactical missiles is well into its third generation of modernization . 
While the development of Chinese long-range missile and nuclear forces has traditionally been characterized as conservative , incremental , and slow , it has taken place against a backdrop of steadily growing official emphasis on the country &apos;s defense-industrial complex , particularly its aerospace sector . 
This process has been accelerated by a confluence of defense-industry reforms , comprehensive military upgrading , and integration of innovative operational concepts . 
The net effect is a growing capability of China &apos;s strategic missile forces and military space platforms . 
Various reports suggest that China is selectively enhancing its strategic and tactical missile capabilities by developing solid-fuel motors ; diversifying its range of warheads and increasing their accuracy ; deploying missiles with multiple warheads ; and upgrading its ballistic-missile defense countermeasures , such as decoys , chaff , jamming , and thermal shielding , and possibly maneuverable reentry vehicles ( MaRVs ) and multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles ( MIRVs ) . 
In particular , China is developing , testing , and deploying a new generation of solid-propellant , road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) . 
These include the DF-31 and DF-31A , which are equipped with nuclear payloads . 
It is also designing and developing new classes of conventional short-range ballistic missiles ( SRBMs ) and medium-range ballistic missiles ( MRBMs ) , such as the DF-21 - mobile , solid-propellant , longer range , more accurate , and able to exploit vulnerabilities in ballistic missile-defense systems . 
As part of its missile and nuclear-force modernization , China is also focusing on developing its sea-launched ballistic missiles ( SLBMs ) such as the JL-2 , testing the DF21-D as an anti-ship ballistic missile ( ASBM ) for maritime strikes , and further developing its anti-satellite weapon capabilities ( ASAT ) . 
The purpose behind China &apos;s continuous modernization of its strategic assets is to enhance the credibility of its deterrent threat by improving the survivability of its nuclear forces . 
Thus , China is diversifying its missiles in terms of their strike capabilities and mobility , and formulating innovative anti-access / area-denial asymmetric warfare concepts to close the gap with technologically more advanced adversaries and near competitors - principally the United States , Russia , and Japan . 
China &apos;s progress in modernizing its strategic assets and capabilities owes much to the ongoing transformation of China &apos;s defense industries , particularly the aerospace sector , over the past decade . 
Since the late 1990 &quot; s , China &apos;s government has gradually introduced elements of competition and globalization , with the aim of overcoming the entrenched monopoly of China &apos;s traditional defense-industrial conglomerates . 
The reforms have been guided by two broad concepts : the &quot; Four Mechanisms &quot; - competition , evaluation , supervision , and encouragement - and yujun yumin , or identifying military potential in civilian capabilities , with defense industries integrating into the broader civilian economy . 
The reforms have essentially enabled China to streamline research and development efforts , as well as technology transfers between selected components of its civil and commercial space programs . 
As a result , China has also been able to bypass existing export controls and restrictions on the transfer of sensitive military technologies , particularly aerospace and satellite components and know-how . 
Indeed , China &apos;s military use of space is increasingly dependent and interlinked with civilian and commercial space activities , infrastructure , and human capital . 
Its space launch vehicles ( SLVs ) can be used for satellites with a range of applications - including communications , weather , observation , and navigation - which may significantly enhance the effectiveness of China &apos;s military space operations and systems . 
While ballistic missiles have generally different rocket engines , basing profiles , and launch methods , their guidance and control systems may use similar components , and SLVs may use stage components based on ballistic missiles . 
The trajectory of China &apos;s ballistic missile R D and production shows a gradual transition from copying and reproducing first-generation Soviet ballistic-missile technologies to adapting and modifying smaller , mobile , solid-propellant ballistic missiles and their follow-on second-generation systems . 
China is now an independent producer and technological innovator of selected missile systems and related aerospace technologies . 
Ultimately , China views its military , civil , and commercial space programs as being at the forefront of its national defense , economic development , and geostrategic influence . 
The rest of the world should regard China &apos;s aerospace capabilities as an important part of its future power projection .
