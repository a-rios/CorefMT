To Err is Science 
Until now , discovery was often considered the main goal of medical science . 
Anyone with a little funding and a few biological specimens in a refrigerator can make thousands of postulated &quot; discoveries . &quot; 
Indeed , the number of research questions that we can pose is increasing exponentially . 
Medical kits the size of a thumbnail can measure a million different biological factors on an individual with an infinitesimal amount of blood . 
A million research questions can be asked on the spot . 
Only a handful of them really will be . 
The vast majority of these initial research claims would yield only spurious findings . 
So the main issue nowadays is to validate &quot; discoveries &quot; by replicating them under different settings . 
Several different teams of researchers need to see them &quot; work &quot; again and again using common rules . 
Moreover , all the teams should agree not to select and report only the data that seem most impressive . 
With selective reporting , we would end up with a long list of all the false discoveries made across all research teams , with only a few true findings buried among this pile of non-replicated waste . 
In fact , empirical data suggest the significance of this danger . 
In a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association published in July 2005 , I showed that refutation is very common , even for the most prestigious research findings . 
I examined the 45 clinical research findings that had received the greatest recognition in the scientific world , as documented by the number of times other scientists had cited them over the last 15 years . 
Even with the most robust types of research - for example , randomized clinical trials - one of four of these results had already been found to be wrong or potentially exaggerated within a few years after publication . 
For epidemiology ( e.g. studies on vitamins , diet , or hormones in terms of their association with health outcomes in the general population ) , four-fifths of the most prestigious findings were rapidly contradicted . 
For molecular research , in the absence of extensive replication , the refutation rate may occasionally exceed 99 % . 
But we should not panic . 
It is to be expected that the majority of research findings are rapidly contradicted and refuted ; indeed , it is part of how progress of science occurs . 
However , we need to adapt to this situation . 
Instead of taking scientific evidence as dogma , we should consider it as tentative information that should be ascribed a level of credibility . 
There is nothing wrong with disseminating scientific information that has a credibility of 10 % , or even 1 % . 
Sometimes , this will be the best evidence we have . 
Scientists themselves may be able to ascribe these levels of credibility to their own work in fairness , if they describe in detail what they set out to do , and how they did it . 
Science is a noble pursuit , but genuine progress in scientific research is not easy to achieve . 
It requires a lot of time , continuous effort , uncompromising integrity , appropriate funding and material support , and unwavering commitment . 
Proposed scientific advances require careful validation and replication by independent scientists . 
Scientific knowledge is never final , but it evolves continuously . 
While these principles are probably well known to serious scientists , they are often forgotten when scientific information is disseminated . 
Our society is awash with inflated information , which is inherent to efforts in many human activities - entertainment , law courts , stock markets , politics , and sports , to name but a few - to gain greater public attention in the framework of mass civilization . 
But it would be a damaging to expect science to &quot; show off &quot; in this way . 
Exaggeration contradicts the key hallmarks of scientific reasoning : critical thinking and careful appraisal of the evidence .
