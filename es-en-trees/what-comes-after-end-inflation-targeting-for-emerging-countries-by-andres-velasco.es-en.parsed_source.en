Monetary Regime Transition in the Emerging World 
SANTIAGO - Is inflation targeting - the rule that most of the world &apos;s major central banks ( though not the United States Federal Reserve ) use to set interest rates - in its death throes ? 
Many analysts seem to think so . 
Mark Carney , currently Governor of the Bank of Canada , has not even taken over his new job at the helm of the Bank of England , yet he has already announced that he might change the BoE &apos;s policy anchor . 
In Japan , the Liberal Democrats won December &apos;s general election after having promised a more expansionary monetary policy . 
And in the US , the Fed has announced that it will keep interest rates low until unemployment reaches 6.5 % . 
None of this is as new as it seems . 
Among rich countries , inflation targeting has been on its way out since the 2008-2009 financial crisis . 
The large-scale asset purchases carried out by the European Central Bank , for example , have little to do with any definition of inflation targeting . 
But inflation targeting has also been losing its hold on policymakers in emerging-market economies . 
Starting in the 1990 &quot; s , central banks in Brazil , Chile , Mexico , Colombia , Peru , South Africa , South Korea , Indonesia , Thailand , and Turkey adopted varieties of the scheme . 
But things changed with the global financial crisis . 
In joint research with Roberto Chang and Luis Felipe CÃ©spedes , we show that all inflation-targeting central banks in Latin America have used a range of non-conventional policy tools , including currency-market interventions and changes in reserve requirements . 
Again , this is a far cry from the textbook version of inflation targeting . 
What comes next ? 
In the developed world , the leading contender to replace inflation targeting is nominal-GDP targeting . 
This seems to be what Carney has in store for Britain . 
Under the proposed new system , if the BoE would like to keep inflation around , say , 2 % , and expects the trend rate of GDP growth to be 3 % , it should announce a target for nominal GDP growth of 5 % . 
This new regime might help rich-country central banks to keep their economies suitably stimulated . 
But , from the point of view of emerging countries , changing the monetary-policy regime in this way makes little sense . 
Central banks in Asia and Latin America have had three problems with inflation targeting from the outset , but moving to nominal-GDP targeting solves none of them . 
The first problem concerns capital inflows and exchange-rate appreciation . 
When rich-country central banks cut interest rates , capital moves south and east . 
Some inflows are always welcome . 
But when the flow becomes a flood , the currency strengthens sharply . 
Commodity exports typically continue to grow , but industrial and non-traditional exports suffer . 
Increasing interest rates only attracts more capital , while cutting rates can cause the economy , already stimulated by the foreign inflows , to overheat . 
Faced with this dilemma , many emerging-market countries have turned to exchange-rate intervention , and then to raising banks &quot; reserve requirements , in order to make foreign borrowing less attractive . 
This is a problem that concerns the composition of output ( traditional versus non-traditional exports ) , not just its level . 
Moving to nominal-GDP targeting would not make a difference . 
The second problem is shared by rich and middle-income countries &quot; central banks : how to ensure that monetary policy addresses the need to maintain financial stability . 
Inflation targeting concerns itself with the prices of goods and services , not the prices of financial assets . 
If &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; set in and a bubble developed in real-estate or equities markets , well , so be it , the standard theory maintains . 
After the devastation wrought by the boom-and-bust cycle of recent years , not many economists are comfortable with the &quot; so be it &quot; attitude anymore . 
Nor are many emerging-market countries &quot; central banks , which are adopting changes in reserve requirements and loan-to-value ratios , among other measures , to prick asset-price bubbles in their early stages . 
Advocates of nominal-GDP targeting claim that these prudential measures could be added to create an extended version of their preferred regime . 
Perhaps , but they could be added to the standard inflation-targeting regime as well . 
Moving from one system to the other helps little in this regard . 
The final problem concerns central banks &quot; role as lenders of last resort in a crisis . 
This job is especially important - and difficult - in emerging markets , because a significant share of debt , both public and private , is typically in foreign currency . 
As a result , lending in crisis situations implies using international reserves and providing foreign-currency liquidity . 
This , too , is alien to the standard target-inflation-and-float-the-currency regime . 
But it would be just as alien to a system in which the central bank targeted nominal GDP and the currency floated . 
These considerations suggest that the way out does not lie in moving from one simple , one-size-fits-all rule to another . 
Emerging markets need a monetary-policy regime that takes explicit account of capital-flow volatility , asset-price misalignments ( including the exchange rate , which is the price of foreign currency ) , and the resulting financial instability . 
The feedback from these factors to interest rates probably should not be the same in tranquil and turbulent times . 
A comprehensive regime should encompass two rules - one for crisis situations and one for &quot; the rest of the time &quot; - plus explicit guidelines for moving from one to the other and back . 
We are far away from being able to formulate and apply such a rule . 
But at least the debate has now begun . 
The floor is open .
