The Return of the Sleepwalkers 
PARIS - On June 28 , 1914 , Archduke Franz Ferdinand , the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne , and his wife , Sophie , Duchess of Hohenberg , were murdered in Sarajevo - triggering a series of bad decisions that culminated in World War I. A century later , the world is again roiled by conflict and uncertainty , exemplified in the Middle East , Ukraine , and the East and South China Seas . 
Can an understanding of the mistakes made in 1914 help the world to avoid another major catastrophe ? 
To be sure , the global order has changed dramatically over the last hundred years . 
But the growing sense that we have lost control over history , together with serious doubts about the capabilities and principles of our leaders , lends a certain relevance to the events in Sarajevo in 1914 . 
Only a year ago , any comparison between the summer of 1914 and today would have seemed artificial . 
The only parallel that could be drawn was limited to Asia : pundits wondered whether China was gradually becoming the modern equivalent of Germany under Kaiser Wilhelm II , with mounting regional tensions over China &apos;s territorial claims resembling , to some extent , the situation in the Balkans on the eve of WWI . 
In the last few months , however , the global context has changed considerably . 
Given recent developments in the Middle East and Eastern Europe , one could reasonably say that the entire world has come to resemble Europe in 1914 . 
In fact , the situation today could be considered even more dangerous . 
After all , a century ago , the world was not haunted by the specter of a nuclear apocalypse . 
With the instruments of humanity &apos;s collective suicide yet to be invented , war could still be viewed , as the Prussian strategist Carl von Clausewitz famously put it , as &quot; the continuation of politics by other means . &quot; 
Nuclear weapons changed everything , with the resulting balance of terror preventing the Cold War &apos;s escalation ( despite several near-misses , most notably the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis ) . 
But , over time , so-called &quot; mutual assured destruction &quot; became an increasingly abstract concept . 
Iran is now trying to convince the United States that a fundamentalist caliphate stretching from Aleppo to Baghdad poses a far greater threat than nuclear weapons . 
Ukraine , in its escalating conflict with Russia , seems most concerned about an energy embargo , not Russia &apos;s nuclear arsenal . 
Even Japan - the only country to have experienced a nuclear attack firsthand - seems indifferent to China &apos;s possession of nuclear weapons , as it assumes an assertive posture toward its increasingly powerful neighbor . 
In short , the &quot; bomb &quot; no longer seems to offer the ultimate protection . 
This shift has been driven at least partly by the global expansion of nuclear weapons . 
It was a lot easier to convince countries to accept a common set of rules when , despite their irreconcilable ideologies , they ultimately shared much of Western culture . 
Herein lies the second fundamental difference between 2014 and 1914 : Europe is no longer the center of the world . 
Kyiv today cannot be compared to Sarajevo a century ago . 
A conflict that began in Europe could no longer develop into a world war - not least because much of Europe is connected through the European Union , which , despite its current unpopularity , makes war among its members unthinkable . 
Given this , the real risks lie outside Europe , where there is no such framework for peace , and the rules of the game vary widely . 
In this context , the world &apos;s growing angst - intensified by the memory of Archduke Ferdinand &apos;s assassination - is entirely appropriate . 
A jihadist state has emerged in the Middle East . 
Asian countries have begun creating artificial islands , following China &apos;s example , in the South China Sea , to strengthen their territorial claims there . 
And Russian President Vladimir Putin is overtly pursuing anachronistic imperial ambitions . 
These developments should serve as a warning that the world cannot avoid the truth and avert disaster at the same time . 
In 1914 , Europe &apos;s leaders , having failed to find satisfactory compromises , resigned themselves to the inevitability of war ( some more enthusiastically than others ) . 
As the historian Christopher Clark put it , they &quot; sleepwalked &quot; into it . 
While 2014 ostensibly has little in common with 1914 , it shares one critical feature : the risk that an increasingly complex security and political environment will overwhelm unexceptional leaders . 
Before they wake up to the risks , the situation could spin out of control .
