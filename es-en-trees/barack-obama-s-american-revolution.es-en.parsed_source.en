Barack Obama &apos;s American Revolution 
For eight years , George W. Bush has managed to incarnate and reinforce all the prejudices and negative stereotypes the world has of the US . 
He has antagonized the world more than any other American president before him , seriously damaging America &apos;s &quot; soft &quot; power by inefficient and excessive use of its &quot; hard &quot; power . 
Reconciling the United States with itself and the world should thus be the twin priorities for America &apos;s next president . 
If there is one candidate who can accomplish this , who can contribute , in a split second , to restoring America &apos;s international reputation , it is Barack Obama . 
Exceptional periods sometimes create exceptional leaders . 
Without the French Revolution , Napoleon Bonaparte would have remained a gifted and frustrated junior military officer . 
Likewise , the current period in America and its relations with the world have been truly exceptional , requiring a leader who can fundamentally challenge a global majority &apos;s view that America has become arrogant , impotent , and selfish . 
Of course , diehard anti-Americans will never be persuaded , but they remain a minority , with the possible exception of the Muslim world . 
The silent majority is ready to be convinced that there is life after Bush . 
Why is Obama so different from the other presidential candidates , and why could he make such a large difference internationally ? 
After all , in foreign policy matters , the next president &apos;s room for maneuver will be very small . 
He ( or she ) will have to stay in Iraq , engage in the Israel-Palestine conflict on the side of Israel , confront a tougher Russia , deal with an ever more ambitious China , and face the challenge of global warming . 
If Obama can make a difference , it is not because of his policy choices , but because of what he is . 
The very moment he appears on the world &apos;s television screens , victorious and smiling , America &apos;s image and soft power would experience something like a Copernican revolution . 
Think of the impression his election would make not only in Africa , but in Asia , the Middle East , and even Europe . 
With its rise to global supremacy , America had become the incarnation of the West , and the West was seen as &quot; white . &quot; 
Power in America shifted first from the East Coast to the West Coast , and then to the South . 
Of course , to reduce Obama to the color of his skin is a grave oversimplification , even if he has been keen to emphasize his &quot; black roots . &quot; 
In fact , African-Americans do not fully support him . 
With his white mother and his African father , he does not fit any African-American precedent . 
But that is another reason why Obama is exceptional : the complexity of his identity makes him truly universal , a global candidate for a global age . 
By virtue of his unique personal history , he can bridge Africa , America , and even Asia - where he studied as a young boy in a Muslim school - thereby reviving the universal image and message of America . 
But , above all , what makes Obama unique , given what the US has been through during the Bush years , is the nature of the message he embodies , which is best summed up in the title of his book The Audacity of Hope . 
If America can move from a culture of fear to one of hope - and again incarnate hope for the world - it will require a leader who embodies the American dream : modern and armed with a humanistic religious message , in contrast to the anxious irrationalism of the Christian conservative movement that fueled Bush &apos;s political base . 
Regardless of whether Obama can deliver on his promises , America will not regain the stature it had between 1941 and 2000 . 
With or without Obama , the &quot; American century &quot; will not be repeated . 
Neo-isolationism is not an option , but restraint - based on confidence and wisdom - is . 
The world needs a more modest and confident America . 
For a European who has been deeply troubled and saddened by America &apos;s evolution in the last decade , Obama , of all the declared presidential candidates , seems to come closest to incarnating such an America .
