An Alternative To Invading Iraq ? 
Now that the UN inspection teams are in Iraq , and as the December 8 deadline approaches for Iraq to declare all its weapons of mass destruction and the facilities for producing them , the world must reckon with a hard question : what is to be done if Saddam Hussein does not obey the Security Council resolution on his weapons of mass destruction ? 
There is a chance that the Iraqi president will comply , but the Council promised &quot; serious consequences &quot; if he does not . 
What should these be ? 
We know from experience that neither political pressures nor economic sanctions hurt Saddam enough . 
Only military action will do . 
But the only military option so far put before us is invasion to change the regime - that is , full-scale war . 
Starting a war is always a grave step , and the effects are never neatly calculable . 
In this instance five key areas of uncertainty and risk exist . 
First , the fighting itself may not be the cakewalk that some assert . 
Churchill once wrote : &quot; Never , never , never assume that any war will be smooth and easy . &quot; 
Brainwashed Iraqi forces , and a regime complicit at every level in Saddam &apos;s crimes , would be fighting not to hang on to a conquest ( as in the Gulf War of 1991 ) but to defend their homeland . 
This raises the spectre of street fighting through Baghdad , desperate use of biological or chemical weapons , an attack to draw in Israel , numerous military and civilian deaths and the further destruction of a ravaged society . 
Second , Iraq is a diverse country , distorted by over thirty years of Saddam &apos;s tyranny , and with no plausible and coherent alternative government in sight . 
How would it be run ? 
WWII &apos;s victors had to rule Germany for four years and Japan for longer . 
According to the New York Times , Pentagon officials have said , &quot; thousands of military specialists in civil affairs familiar with the linguistic and cultural differences within Iraq would probably be deployed throughout the country . &quot; 
Where is this remarkable cohort to come from ? 
Next , no government in the region loves Saddam , but all fear popular reaction to a third Western onslaught on an Islamic state , this time with much less clear justification than over Kuwait and in Afghanistan . 
Some hawks might welcome the destabilisation of Saudi Arabia . 
Should anyone else ? 
Indeed , the fourth dimension of risk is that an invasion could weaken the support of key governments for action against terrorists , and provoke further outrages . 
Fifth , the world economy is scarcely thriving . 
Would unrest in the main oil-producing region help or hinder prosperity ? 
What would the whole enterprise cost ? 
Explicit UN support for invasion might ease some of these risks , but it would not remove them . 
Necessity sometimes dictates that risks be accepted , as Britain did in 1939 . 
Three main reasons for acting against Saddam have been offered . 
We need no longer address the first - that he was behind the attacks of September 2001 on the US . 
The Bush Administration makes no claim to have adequate evidence of this . 
The second reason adduced is that Saddam poses a grave security threat to the US and to his region . 
But his two aggressive adventures - the more recent over twelve years ago - ended in humiliating failure . 
He is weaker militarily now than then , he cannot hit the US directly , and he must know that fresh aggression would bring the house down upon him . 
Saddam &apos;s only option would be to provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorists . 
But that would be so uncontrollable and dangerous for him as to be deeply implausible - unless we drive him to desperation . 
Saddam Hussein heads a state , not a shadowy terrorist outfit . 
Deterrence - which works by basic human nature , not through some arcane construct peculiar to the Cold War - can be brought to bear here . 
The third reason for acting against Saddam is cogent : that his defiance of the Security Council since 1991 cannot be allowed to stand . 
The Council has now made that plain . 
Yet we must still ask whether a full-scale invasion is the only way , a necessary and proportionate way , to fulfil that aim . 
We should not forswear that option , but we ought to consider others , not least because the Security Council - whose backing will be politically if not legally crucial - may never support invasion . 
It would be odd to uphold the Council &apos;s authority by means that failed to get its approval . 
The Council is more likely to accept an option of mounting a punitive program of air strikes - going well beyond what was done in 1998 - on suspected WMD sites , presidential compounds , the Republican Guard and other armed-force targets . 
This would hurt and weaken Saddam , and establish unmistakably the message that defiance of the UN carries severe penalties . 
The Council could also declare that any fresh aggression , or any use , threat or transfer of WMD , would trigger Saddam &apos;s removal and his pursuit as an international criminal like Slobodan Milosevic . 
Such a course would not please those whose underlying desire is regime change , not disarmament or punishment . 
The US has skilfully carried the international community along with it so far . 
To throw away that achievement would impose costs not confined to the present episode . 
The sledgehammer of invasion could easily cause far more harm than the ills it seeks to stamp out . 
Dealing with Saddam does not need , and is not worth , a full-scale war .
