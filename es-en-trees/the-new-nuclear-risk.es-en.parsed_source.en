The New Nuclear Risk 
BERLIN - Humans love to suppress abstract dangers . 
They react only after they get their fingers burned . 
In handling nuclear risks , however , we can hardly get away with such childlike behavior . 
To begin with , the old system of nuclear deterrence , which has survived particularly in the United States and Russia since the Cold War &apos;s end , still involves lots of risks and dangers . 
While the international public largely ignores this fact , the risks remain . 
To be sure , in the 1990 &quot; s the US and Russia reduced their nuclear arsenals from 65,000 to approximately 26,000 weapons . 
Moreover , there are another 1,000 nuclear weapons in the hands of other nuclear states . 
A second cause for worry is that the world is poised to enter a new nuclear age that threatens to be even more dangerous and expensive than the Cold War era of mutually assured destruction ( MAD ) . 
Indeed , the outlines of this new nuclear age are already visible : 
The connection between terrorism and nuclear weapons ; a nuclear-armed North Korea ; the risk of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East triggered by Iran &apos;s nuclear program ; a new definition of state sovereignty as &quot; nuclear sovereignty , &quot; accompanied by a massive increase in the number of small and medium-sized nuclear states ; a possible collapse of public order in nuclear Pakistan ; the illegal proliferation of military nuclear technology ; the legal proliferation of civilian nuclear technology and an increase in the number of &quot; civilian &quot; nuclear states , implying military proliferation risks ; the nuclearization of space , triggering an arms race among large nuclear powers . Important political leaders , especially in the two biggest nuclear powers , the US and Russia , know today &apos;s existing risks and tomorrow &apos;s emerging ones all too well . 
Yet nothing is being done to control , contain , or eliminate them . 
On the contrary , the situation is worsening . 
Vital pillars of the old arms-control and anti-proliferation regime have either been destroyed amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; as was the case with the Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; or substantially weakened , as with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) . 
Responsibility for this lays largely with the Bush administration which , by terminating the ABM Treaty , not only weakened the international control systems for nuclear weapons , but also sat on its hands when confronted with the NPT &apos;s imminent collapse . 
At the beginning of the twenty-first century , proliferation of military nuclear technology is one of the major threats to humanity , particularly if this technology falls into terrorists &quot; hands . 
The use of nuclear weapons by terrorists would not only result in a major humanitarian tragedy , but also would most likely move the world beyond the threshold for actually waging a nuclear war . 
The consequences would be a nightmare . 
Nearly equally worrisome is the nuclear redefinition of state sovereignty because it will not only lead to a large number of small , politically unstable nuclear powers , but will also increase the risk of proliferation into the hands of terrorists . 
Pakistan would , most likely , no longer be an isolated case . 
An international initiative for the renewal and improvement of the international control regime , led by both big nuclear powers , is urgently needed to meet these and all other risks of the new nuclear age . 
Here , the willingness of nuclear powers to implement their commitment to disarmament , as agreed in the NPT , is of prime importance . 
The NPT - a bedrock of peace for more than three decades - is based on a political agreement between nuclear and non-nuclear states : the latter abstain from obtaining nuclear weapons , while the former destroy their arsenals . 
Unfortunately , only the first part of this agreement was realized ( though not completely ) , while the second part still awaits fulfillment . 
The NPT remains indispensable and needs urgent revision . 
However , this central pillar of international proliferation control is on the brink of collapse . 
The most recent Review Conference in New York , in May 2005 , ended virtually without any result . 
The essential defect of the NPT is now visible in the nuclear dispute between Iran and the United Nations Security Council : the Treaty permits the development of all nuclear components indispensable for military use - particularly uranium enrichment - so long as there is no outright nuclear weapons program . 
This means that in emerging nuclear countries only one single political decision is required to &quot; weaponize &quot; a nuclear program . 
This kind of &quot; security &quot; is not sufficient . 
Another controversial issue also has also come to the fore in connection with the current nuclear conflict with Iran : discrimination-free access to nuclear technology . 
Solving this problem will require the internationalization of access to civilian nuclear technology , along with filling the security gap under the existing NPT and substantially more far-reaching monitoring of all states that want to be part of such a system . 
Leaders around the world know the dangers of a new nuclear age ; they also know how to minimize them . 
This must change . 
Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are not questions of the past . 
They need to be addressed today if they are not to become the most dangerous threats tomorrow .
