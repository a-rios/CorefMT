Genetics for the People ? 
LONDON - &quot; Your genetic information should be controlled by you , &quot; declares an advertisement for the American direct-to-consumer ( DTC ) genetic-testing firm 23andMe . 
Amid the current furor over electronic eavesdropping , the notion that individuals should decide who can access their personal data is particularly appealing . 
But whether 23andMe is practicing what it preaches remains dubious , at best . 
In fact , even some &quot; techno-libertarians , &quot; who believe that government should not regulate new developments in biotechnology , have supported the US Food and Drug Administration &apos;s decision - outlined in a scathing letter to 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki last November - to prevent the firm from marketing its tests pending further scientific analysis . 
&quot; I &apos;d like to be able to argue that the &#91; FDA &#93; is wantonly standing in the way of entrepreneurism and innovation by cracking down on 23andMe , &quot; wrote Matthew Herper in Forbes . 
&quot; I wish that was the story I &apos;m about to write , but it &apos;s not . &quot; 
According to the FDA , 23andMe &apos;s marketing of an unapproved Personal Genome Service ( PGS ) violated federal law , because , after six years , the firm still had not proved that the tests actually work . 
23andMe is also coming under fire from its users . 
Just five days after the FDA sent its letter , a California woman , Lisa Casey , filed a $ 5 million class-action lawsuit against the firm , alleging false and misleading advertising . 
Doubts about 23andMe &apos;s PGS go back a long way . 
In 2008 , the American Society of Clinical Oncology commissioned a report that declared that the partial type of genetic analysis offered by 23andMe had not been clinically proved to be effective in cancer care . 
Two years later , the US Government Accountability Office concluded after a lengthy investigation that DTC genetic tests provide &quot; misleading &quot; results - a situation that is complicated further by &quot; deceptive marketing . &quot; 
What 23andMe offered was a $ 99 test for some 250 genetically linked conditions , based on a partial reading of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) - points where individuals &quot; genomes vary by a single DNA base pair . 
Given that DTC genetic tests target only a fraction of the human genome &apos;s three billion markers , and various companies sample different SNPs , different tests may return disparate results for the same customer , who might then make serious medical decisions based on inaccurate information . 
In this context , it is unsurprising that even those who oppose regulation in general see the need for it in the case of DTC testing . 
But the issue goes beyond inaccuracy . 
As the journalist Charles Seife has pointed out , the retail genetics test is &quot; meant to be a front end for a massive information-gathering operation against an unwitting public . &quot; 
Indeed , when 23andMe customers log in to their accounts , they are invited to fill out surveys about their lifestyle , family background , and health , adding epidemiological value to the genetic data , which are then used by the firm &apos;s research arm , 23andWe . 
In providing this information , 23andMe &apos;s customers are building a valuable &quot; biobank &quot; for the company . 
Given that the United States decided not to create a national biobank like the United Kingdom &apos;s , owing to the high set-up costs - estimated at about a billion dollars - 23andMe may well view its growing biobank as saving it a massive outlay . 
Some 60 % of 23andMe customers have agreed to provide the requested information . 
Of course , one could argue that they are not &quot; an unwitting public , &quot; but altruistic volunteers - so generous , in fact , that , beyond paying for the service , they hand over the value of their subsequent labor in providing epidemiological data . 
Tom Sawyer pulled off that business strategy when he persuaded his friends to pay him for the privilege of taking over his hated chore , painting the picket fence . 
But most scientific research subjects either receive compensation or contribute their time free of charge ; they do not pay to participate . 
Casey &apos;s lawsuit has latched onto this practice , which her attorney calls , &quot; a very thinly disguised way of getting people to pay &#91; 23andMe &#93; to build a DNA database . &quot; 
Even 23andMe admits that the biobank is the core of the company &apos;s strategy . 
&quot; The long game here is not to make money selling kits , although the kits are essential to get the base level data , &quot; says board member Patrick Chung . 
&quot; Once you have the data , &#91; 23andMe &#93; does actually become the Google of personalized health care . &quot; 
That is exactly the problem , according to Seife . 
The massive corporate data store that Google has accumulated through all of our individual searches has become its most valuable asset . 
&quot; By parceling out that information to help advertisers target you , with or without your consent , Google makes more than $ 10 billion every quarter , &quot; Seife writes . 
In other words , users have become the product . 
To be sure , the 23andMe Privacy Statement stipulates that it &quot; uses Genetic and Self-Reported Information &#91; only &#93; from users who have given consent . &quot; 
But it also includes a less prominently displayed qualifier : &quot; If you do not give consent ... we may still use your Genetic and / or Self-Reported Information for R &amp; D purposes . &quot; 
This &quot; may include disclosure of Aggregated Genetic and Self-Reported Information to third-party non-profit and / or commercial research partners who will not publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal . &quot; 
In other words , commercial use of non-identifiable information is still allowed without donors &quot; explicit consent . 
That is what worries libertarians - and anyone else who is concerned about the expansion of online efforts to gather information about individuals . 
As a 23andMe blog post by Wojcicki puts it , &quot; Wikipedia , YouTube , and MySpace have all changed the world by empowering individuals to share information . 
We believe this same phenomenon can revolutionize health care . &quot; 
But if individuals share information involuntarily , it is the company - not its customers - that will be empowered .
