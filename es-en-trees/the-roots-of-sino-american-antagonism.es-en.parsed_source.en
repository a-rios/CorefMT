The Roots of Sino-American Antagonism 
Although we still do not know what sent jousting Chinese and American planes as well as Sino � US relations into a nose dive , this has not hindered people on both sides from unleashing an avalanche of accusations and uncompromising demands for apologies . 
While an answer to the question as to what actually happened remains elusive , a more important question begs our attention : why do such incidents balloon into crises that keep US � China ties almost permanently out of kilter ? 
Both nations have a long and complicated history with each other . 
The United States arrived on the Chinese scene during the 19th century flushed with its &quot; manifest destiny &quot; to trade and save China &apos;s soul , following this in the 20th century with a messianic effort to save China from Godless Communism . 
But mixed with America &apos;s moral and economic concerns were large measures of condescension and arrogance , which arose from seeing China as a poor , benighted land in need of rescue . 
For a proud and once powerful land such as China , such noblesse oblige was painful to accept and created lasting reservoirs of resentment . 
To travel through urban China today is in many ways a deceptive experience . 
Yes , China has emerged into the global market and boasts many of the hallmarks of a modernizing society . 
Many of these emblems of modernity and cosmopolitanism , however , mask the provenance of China &apos;s &quot; socialist revolution . &quot; 
We forget , indeed , that China had such a revolution , and that there were both reasons and consequences to that convulsive experience . 
China &apos;s current government arrived through a tectonic revolution animated by anti � imperialism , anti � colonialism , and anti � capitalism codified as orthodox Marxist � Leninist doctrine . 
These sentiments resulted from a century of being preyed upon by the West beginning with the first Opium War ( 1839 � 42 ) , when Britain seized Hong Kong as a colony and then sailed up China &apos;s coast with warships to force open one coastal &quot; treaty port &quot; after an other . 
Over the next century , China became a patchwork of special foreign concessions , spheres of economic influence and missionary enclaves which left it , fen &apos;gua , or &quot; carved up like a melon , &quot; in the parlance of the time . 
This bitter experience reached an apogee in the 1930s and &apos; 40s with Japan &apos;s brutal occupation . 
It was not until US involvement in the Chinese civil war on the side of Chiang Kai � shek &apos;s Nationalists in the late 1940s and in the Korean War in the early 1950s that America became fully identified as a major &quot; hostile foreign force &quot; by the Chinese Communists . 
Yet , by the mid � &apos; 70s , when I first went to China during the Cultural Revolution , hardly a public surface was not emblazoned with the slogan : &quot; Down With American Imperialism And Its Running Dogs . &quot; 
Even though the Chinese felt incensed by foreign interference and domination , many also came to admire America for its democracy , openness , energy and willingness to help . 
This divided attitude meant that China tended to react in ways as contradictory as they were impassioned and unpredictable , especially when its pride was piqued . 
Nothing was more repugnant to China &apos;s new nationalists than the idea of a weak and aggrieved China victimized by foreign exploitation . 
Nothing provoked a more muscular reaction after Mao came to power than the humiliating prospect of feeling unable to resist foreign predation . 
It is from this side of China &apos;s bipolar attitude toward America that its emotional response to the aerial collision near Hainan Island arises . 
Indeed , like a character trait encoded on a recessive gene which reexpresses itself even after it has lost its functionality , China continues to react to the world around it as if it were still fighting against implacable imperialist foes . 
What makes the Hainan spy plane incident so provocative is the idea that US planes cruise the China coast like so many 19th century British men � of � war , now stealing China &apos;s military secrets by triggering radar systems and eavesdropping rather than firing cannons at Chinese junks and selling opium . 
It is not extreme to describe China &apos;s reaction to such incidents as almost robotic . 
For , if there was one thing to which Mao &apos;s revolution was committed which still endures , it is a commitment to the idea that China will never again allow itself to appear weak and defenseless against foreign incursion . 
What the incident over Hainan reveals is how deeply rooted ways of reacting to the world can become in a national psyche . 
Chinese leaders imagine that they are demonstrating strength when they bluster and detain the American EP � 3E crew , but they are actually revealing a self � defeating backwardness because they have mis � identified their real enemy , which is not America , even when it acts in a retrograde fashion . 
Their enemy is their own suspiciousness and paranoia which deludes them into believing that the world is still against them when it is not . 
Whatever the result of the Hainan incident , China and the US will continue to have disputes . 
America &apos;s challenge is to escape the Cold War mind � set , China &apos;s challenge is to transcend its past in the name of its present national interest . 
To achieve this , it will probably have to transcend its Marxists � Leninist heritage - something it has begun to do in important ways . 
As a new form of &quot; self strengthening , &quot; a cause that Chinese reformers embraced at the end of the 19th century , China needs to stop brandishing old wounds and instead of demanding apologies as an aggrieved party , seek a new , equal status that the rest of the world , including America , is ready to confer .
