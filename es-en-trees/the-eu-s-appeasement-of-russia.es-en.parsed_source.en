The EU &apos;s Appeasement of Russia 
Once again , Ukraine is in the eye of a political hurricane . 
Faced with a possible constitutional coup that would have eviscerated his powers , President Viktor Yushchenko has dissolved Ukraine &apos;s parliament and called for new elections . 
His political opponent - Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych - is violently opposing that move , fueling a bitter constitutional struggle that ultimately will settle Ukraine &apos;s future orientation . 
Will Ukraine continue its turn towards the West , as Yushchenko and his Orange Revolution ally Yuliya Tymoshenko want , or return to Russia &apos;s strategic embrace , as Yanukovych and his allies want ? 
It was Russia &apos;s attempt , only two and a half years ago , to install Yanukovych as President via rampant electoral fraud that touched off the &quot; Orange Revolution . &quot; 
After months of struggle , Yushchenko rightfully claimed the presidency . 
But the revolution petered out , former partners were soon at loggerheads , giving Yanukovych and his allies a chance to return to power . 
Throughout this difficult period , the European Union has failed Ukraine , bluntly declaring that it should not hold any hope of future membership and justifying this stance by citing its internal problems - the stranded Constitutional Treaty - and growing public sentiment against further enlargement . 
But political leaders in the EU are merely succumbing to ill-informed fears . 
Rather than informing their populations about the economic and political benefits of the recent enlargements , most are playing on voters &quot; &quot; enlargement fatigue . &quot; 
As a result , there is now an obvious risk of a new internal split in the country . 
Even current EU members feel abandoned by the Union : there is a growing sense in the three Baltic Countries , Poland , and Hungary that the EU is allowing them to be squeezed by Russia , particularly on energy policy . 
Of course , EU membership gives these countries a greater sense of security . 
But the EU &apos;s old members have brought on an enormous sense of disappointment by ignoring its new members &quot; security concerns in favor of preserving their own ties with Russia , particularly in cutting energy deals that they think will assure them of supplies . 
Other post-Soviet countries are also experiencing internal pressure to re-orient themselves towards Russia and feel abandoned by the EU . 
Georgia and Moldova both face secessionist-minded , Russian-dominated enclaves that are to a large extent controlled from Moscow - Abkhasia and South Ossetia in Georgia and Transdniestria in Moldova . 
Both countries suffer from Russian trade embargoes on their most important export products - wines and foodstuffs . 
Moldova appears set to cave in to Russia &apos;s pressure , partly to attract desperately needed inward investment at a time when little aid has come from the West , particularly the EU . 
Indeed , like Ukraine , Moldova and Georgia have been left without any clear signals from the EU that they will have the prospect of membership at some point in the future . 
Russia is also flexing its muscles over the question of Kosovo &apos;s future , raising objections in the United Nations Security Council to the UN &apos;s plan for independence and openly supporting Serbia &apos;s quest to maintain its supremacy over Kosovo . 
Russia argues that independence for Kosovo may &quot; create a precedent &quot; - a veiled threat to mobilize its secessionist proxies not only in Georgia and Moldova , but also in Ukraine &apos;s Crimea region . 
Moreover , Russia is hinting at the many worries within EU countries about potential demands for self-rule , by , for example , the Basques in Spain , the Turks in northern Cyprus , and the large Hungarian minorities in Romania and Slovakia . 
All of these countries are now acting with great hesitation in the debate about Kosovo , clearly influenced by Russian warnings about &quot; setting a precedent . &quot; 
But this argument overlooks the fundamental difference between Kosovo and the situation in all other areas with large national minorities . 
Whereas Kosovo was part of a federation , the former Republic of Yugoslavia , the EU &apos;s other potential trouble spots are all parts of unitary nation states . 
Thus , independence for Kosovo in no way creates a &quot; precedent . &quot; 
Of course , Russia knows this . 
But , by using its energy resources and recovered confidence to fuel instability and discord , it is seeking to expand its sphere of interest - an outcome that can be averted only by a unanimous and determined EU response . 
Unfortunately , instead of reaching out to endangered nations like Ukraine , the EU beacon remains dark and its leaders silent .
