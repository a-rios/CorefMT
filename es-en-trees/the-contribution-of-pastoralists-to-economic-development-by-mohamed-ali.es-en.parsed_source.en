The New-Model Nomad 
MOGADISHU - One of my earliest childhood memories is of swimming in a small gully near my grandmother &apos;s home in Yaaq Bari Wayne , a dusty collection of tin-roofed adobe buildings huddled together in the plains of southern Somalia &apos;s Bay region . 
After the Gu rains , the gully became a deep triangular cleft cut into the ground , filled with muddy water . 
Children gathered like ants to spilled sugar , jumping off ledges and diving into its murky depths with screams and whoops of excitement . 
Many were children of nomadic herders , who moved south in May and June in search of better pastures . 
When they arrived , brown domes made of crisscrossed branches and layers of multicolored mats would appear like crowds of dappled beetles on the outskirts of town . 
For me , the nomad was a romantic figure , akin to the American cowboy of the Wild West . 
In the world &apos;s harshest environment , they trekked hundreds of kilometers , surviving on camel milk and dried meat , with all of their possessions strapped to a camel &apos;s back . 
But , in the last two decades , the story of the Somali nomad has become far less romantic - and far more complex . 
Nomads have been victims of famine , violent conflict , and circumstance , accounting for a significant share of the deaths - as many as one million - caused by 22 years of civil war , and of the 260,000 Somalis who died of starvation in 2010-2012 . 
At the same time , nomads have been perpetrators of violence and terrorism . 
And yet there is another way to view nomads : as survivors , entrepreneurs , providers , and agents of transformation . 
With global problems like food insecurity and climate change threatening livelihoods around the world , nomadic and pastoral lifestyles have the potential to protect and sustain millions of people . 
In fact , it was cataclysmic climate change - which transformed a lush , green Sahara into a harsh desert - that triggered the emergence of such lifestyles in East Africa 5,000 years ago . 
Cattle herding allowed nomads to create livelihoods in an increasingly unpredictable and challenging environment , characterized by an arid climate and scarce resources . 
Today , there are some 50 million nomadic herders in Sub-Saharan Africa , and as many as 150 million agro-pastoralists , who combine traditional nomadic animal-rearing with some form of agriculture . 
Policymakers often view nomadic pastoralism as an archaic and unproductive way of life , with little economic benefit . 
Pastoralist systems are 20 % more productive than traditional ranching methods . 
Using land that cannot support conventional agriculture , pastoralists and agro-pastoralists produce meat , milk , and livestock products that sustain millions . 
Indeed , according to an OECD study , they are responsible for 10 % of the world &apos;s meat production ; in some regions , they supply as much as 60 % of the beef and 70 % of the milk consumed . 
Pastoralism is thus an essential livelihood system , with the potential to help overcome food insecurity - particularly in Somalia , where more than 50 % of the population are nomadic herders . 
In order to unleash this potential , a strong support system that improves pastoralists &quot; access to capital and markets , while bolstering human-resource development and capacity-building , is needed . 
Following the example of Mongolia , where pastoralists can purchase private insurance to protect against the loss of herds from drought , microcredit programs could be established to insure pastoralists against similar risks and thus provide funds for restocking after a disaster . 
In order to enhance their livelihoods &quot; stability and profitability further , pastoralists need to be integrated into the formal economy . 
Effective trade networks and access to livestock markets would enable them to increase sales substantially . 
Increased access to technology is also crucial to improving nomads &quot; economic prospects . 
In Niger , pastoralists use mobile phones to keep abreast of commodity prices in regional markets , which enables them to sell their camels where prices are highest and purchase grains where prices are lowest . 
In Kenya , veterinarians send text-message alerts to warn pastoralists of disease outbreaks and provide vaccination information . 
Providing such support systems for pastoralists could prove to be an effective strategy for advancing economic development , enhancing food security , and reducing dependence on food aid in Somalia and elsewhere . 
Indeed , for many countries , nomads - recast as intrepid entrepreneurs - could be the key to securing a prosperous future .
