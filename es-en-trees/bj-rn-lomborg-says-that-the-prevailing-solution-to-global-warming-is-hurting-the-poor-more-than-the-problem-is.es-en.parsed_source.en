The Poverty of Renewables 
MIAMI - According to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , &quot; Climate change harms the poor first and worst . &quot; 
This is true , because the poor are the most vulnerable and have the least resources with which to adapt . 
But we often forget that current policies to address global warming make energy much more costly , and that this harms the world &apos;s poor much more . 
Solar and wind power was subsidized by $ 60 billion in 2012 . 
This means that the world spent $ 60 billion more on energy than was needed . 
And , because the total climate benefit was a paltry $ 1.4 billion , the subsidies essentially wasted $ 58.6 billion . 
Biofuels were subsidized by another $ 19 billion , with essentially no climate benefit . 
All of that money could have been used to improve health care , hire more teachers , build better roads , or lower taxes . 
Forcing everyone to buy more expensive , less reliable energy pushes up costs throughout the economy , leaving less for other public goods . 
The average of macroeconomic models indicates that the total cost of the EU &apos;s climate policy will be € 209 billion ( $ 280 billion ) per year from 2020 until the end of the century . 
The burden of these policies falls overwhelmingly on the world &apos;s poor , because the rich can easily pay more for their energy . 
I am often taken aback by well-meaning and economically comfortable environmentalists who cavalierly suggest that gasoline prices should be doubled or electricity exclusively sourced from high-cost green sources . 
That may go over well in affluent Hunterdon County , New Jersey , where residents reportedly spend just 2 % of their income on gasoline . 
But the poorest 30 % of the US population spend almost 17 % of their after-tax income on gasoline . 
Similarly , environmentalists boast that households in the United Kingdom have reduced their electricity consumption by almost 10 % since 2005 . 
But they neglect to mention that this reflects a 50 % increase in electricity prices , mostly to pay for an increase in the share of renewables from 1.8 % to 4.6 % . 
The poor , no surprise , have reduced their consumption by much more than 10 % , whereas the rich have not reduced theirs at all . 
Over the past five years , heating a UK home has become 63 % more expensive , while real wages have declined . 
Some 17 % of households are now energy poor - that is , they have to spend more than 10 % of their income on energy ; and , because elderly people are typically poorer , about a quarter of their households are energy poor . 
Deprived pensioners burn old books to keep warm , because they are cheaper than coal , they ride on heated buses all day , and a third leave part of their homes cold . 
In Germany , where green subsidies will cost € 23.6 billion this year , household electricity prices have increased by 80 % since 2000 , causing 6.9 million households to live in energy poverty . 
Wealthy homeowners in Bavaria can feel good about their inefficient solar panels , receiving lavish subsidies essentially paid by poor tenants in the Ruhr , who cannot afford their own solar panels but still have to pay higher electricity costs . 
The list goes on . 
In Greece , where tax hikes on oil have driven up heating costs by 48 % , more and more Athenians are cutting down park trees , causing air pollution from wood burning to triple . 
But climate policies carry an even larger cost in the developing world , where three billion people lack access to cheap and plentiful energy , perpetuating their poverty . 
They cook and keep warm by burning twigs and dung , producing indoor air pollution that causes 3.5 million deaths per year - by far the world &apos;s biggest environmental problem . 
Access to electricity could solve that problem , while allowing families to read at night , own a refrigerator to keep food from spoiling , or use a computer to connect with the world . 
It would also allow businesses to produce more competitively , creating jobs and economic growth . 
Consider Pakistan and South Africa , where a dearth of generating capacity means recurrent blackouts that wreak havoc on businesses and cost jobs . 
Yet the funding of new coal-fired power plants in both countries has been widely opposed by well-meaning Westerners and governments . 
But this is hypocritical . 
The rich world gets just 1.2 % of its energy from hugely expensive solar and wind technologies , and we would never accept having power only when the wind was blowing . 
Over the next two years , Germany will build ten new coal-fired power plants to keep the lights on . 
In 1971 , 40 % of China &apos;s energy came from renewables . 
Since then , it has powered its explosive economic growth almost exclusively with highly polluting coal , lifting 680 million people out of poverty . 
Today , China gets a trifling 0.23 % of its energy from wind and solar . 
By contrast , Africa gets 50 % of its energy today from renewables - and remains poor . 
A new analysis from the Center for Global Development quantifies our disregard of the world &apos;s poor . 
Investing in renewables , we can pull one person out of poverty for about $ 500 . 
But , using gas electrification , we could pull more than four people out of poverty for the same amount . 
By focusing on our climate concerns , we deliberately choose to leave more than three out of four people in darkness and poverty . 
Addressing global warming effectively requires long-term innovation that makes green energy affordable to all . 
Until then , wasting enormous sums of money at the expense of the world &apos;s poor is no solution at all .
