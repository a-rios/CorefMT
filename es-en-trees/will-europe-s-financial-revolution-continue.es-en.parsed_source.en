Will Europe \ u0027s Financial Revolution Continue ? 
Over the last two decades Europe experienced a dramatic expansion of financial markets at the expense of its traditional system of financing based on close relationships between large banks and established firms . 
Since 1980 the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP soared more than 13-fold , while equity financing rose 16-fold . 
In 1980 , stock market capitalization relative to GDP was five times greater in the US and UK than in Continental Europe ; by 2000 , it was only 60 % higher . 
Disclosure standards improved throughout the Continent , as did laws to protect minority shareholders . 
For example , before 1980 no member of today &apos;s European Union , except France and Sweden , had an anti-insider trading law - and in Sweden the law , although introduced in 1971 , was not enforced for the first time until 1990 . 
By 2000 , all EU members had anti-insider trading laws and most were enforcing them . 
What caused this change ? 
Is it benefiting all EU countries , and will it persist as EU enlargement proceeds ? 
Relationship-based financial systems perform better when markets and firms are smaller , when legal protection is weaker , there is little public information , and innovation is incremental . 
Banks tend to have close , long-term , and protective ties with the managers of such firms , primarily because the bank &apos;s holdings are illiquid . 
This can provide considerable stability - indeed , the second half of the 20th century saw only four German firms succumb to hostile takeovers - but at the cost of reducing access to finance and curtailing future opportunities . 
By contrast , market-based financial systems perform better when economies and firms are bigger and more formally organized , with better legal enforcement and transparency , and when innovation is constant . 
A market-based system gives new firms - hence new technologies - more chances to obtain financing , because many investors assess firms independently . 
But financial systems do not emerge as a result of their superiority in a particular environment . 
Vested interests distort the process of evolution . 
Over the last decade , trade liberalization and monetary integration supported the expansion of market-based financing in Europe . 
Trade integration exposed domestic banks and firms to foreign competition , limiting national governments &apos; ability to intervene on behalf of favored domestic companies . 
Similarly , the European Commission deemed subsidies to publicly-owned firms illegal if they distorted competition across member states , while the fiscal discipline imposed by the Euro ended pervasive general government credit subsidies - the essential lubricant of relationship-based systems . 
Moreover , the volume of corporate debt securities almost tripled after the introduction of the Euro eliminated exchange-rate risk . 
The European Commission also opened up the market for corporate control by vetoing the barriers against hostile takeovers that most EU governments had erected . 
But now that Europe &apos;s internal economic boundaries have been mostly removed , and the political objective has shifted to political unification , integration may no longer be so market-friendly . 
The more political power is centralized , the more the central authority can interfere with market development . 
The pro-market bias that characterized EU policy up to now ( with notable exceptions , such as agricultural policy ) may well shift in the opposite direction . 
In trade zones formed by heterogeneous states , vested interests tend to be diverse and find it hard to lobby at the supranational level . 
Political integration , by contrast , might have an opposite effect on the development of markets . 
The threat of capital flight to nearby political entities creates a strong incentive to keep policies market-friendly , but it is suppressed when neighboring political entities coalesce . 
Incumbent financiers , meanwhile , have a powerful vested interest in opposing a market-based system , which favors credit evaluation and risk management over their main &quot; skill &quot; : being well connected . 
They also have the ability to organize successfully against the market , particularly in small countries , where incumbents form a well-defined group whose members often attended the same elite schools , frequent the same clubs , and intermarry . 
The question is not whether Europe should move toward a market-based financial system . 
The real question is whether Europe retains the political will to continue to do so , and whether EU countries can strengthen the institutions necessary to reap the full benefits of financial markets . 
There is a serious danger that reforms that facilitate markets will benefit northern Europe but harm underdeveloped regions in southern Europe by depriving them of the relationship-based system . 
In these regions , higher rates of corruption and tax evasion , together with smaller average firm size , undermine the production of credible information that financial markets need . 
Partly for this reason , EU enlargement is superior - at least for financial markets - to political unification , which encourages vested interests to lobby at the central level . 
Indeed , one benefit of the European Commission &apos;s rule that some decisions must be unanimous is that its impedes the exercise of monopoly power , thus reducing the risk that centralized authority will be used against markets . 
This is all the more important because leaders in both the US and Europe are beginning to pander to the anti-globalization movement . 
America &apos;s corporate scandals have undermined the market &apos;s moral standing , while the end of the Internet bubble has weakened its economic credibility . 
The adverse distributive effects of market-based finance may serve to further strengthen anti-market forces in Europe , especially in southern Europe . 
The EU can buck this anti-market trend by promoting structural reforms in southern European countries and focussing on enlargement to increase economic competition .
