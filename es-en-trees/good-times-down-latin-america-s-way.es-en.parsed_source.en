Good Times Down Latin America &apos;s Way 
MEXICO CITY - For Latin America , 2011 was , in Frank Sinatra &apos;s terms , a very good year - and 2012 doesn &apos;t look like being so bad either . 
For a region not always accustomed to things going well , this is a somewhat strange state of affairs . 
Three elections were held in Latin America in 2011 . 
Two - in Argentina and Peru - went well ; the other - in Nicaragua - was marred by egregious fraud and heavy-handed government intervention in favor of the incumbent . 
Still , two out of three is not bad in a region where , previously , if elections were held at all , disputes about the outcomes were the norm . 
In economic terms , high commodity prices fueled strong growth in South America in 2011 , and the modest US recovery benefited nearby countries . 
In Chile , Peru , Argentina , Uruguay , Bolivia , and , to a lesser extent , Brazil and Colombia , voracious Chinese and Indian demand for raw materials and food boosted foreign reserves , enabled heavy government spending , and sustained high levels of imports . 
All this led to average growth rates well in excess of 4 % . 
But it also led to new doubts about the wisdom of reliance on commodity exports . 
Chilean economist and politician Carlos Ominami , in his tell-all memoir Secretos de la Concertación , wondered what would happen if China &apos;s economy slowed or its real-estate bubble burst . 
By the end of the year , this seemed to be happening : commodity prices and growth rates were dropping , and 2012 , while still promising strong economic performance , will not match this year &apos;s success . 
Sustained lower prices may bring chickens home to roost . 
The outliers were Venezuela , despite high oil prices , and the Caribbean Basin : Mexico , Central America , and the islands . 
These countries export manufactured goods to the US , on which they also rely for tourism and remittances ; they lack either the geography or the geology to become great commodity exporters ( or , like Mexico , they export all of their oil to the US ) . 
But even the outliers enjoyed decent growth this year . 
If the US avoids a new slowdown , they may do better than South America in 2012 . 
All told , with the exception of 2009 , the entire region will have experienced a full decade of uninterrupted growth - something not witnessed since the 1970 &quot; s . 
The boom fueled expansion of Latin America &apos;s middle classes . 
Between 1950 and 1980 , most Latin American countries &quot; middle classes comprised between one-quarter and one-third of the population . 
Then came the debt crisis of the 1980 &quot; s , the extreme structural reforms and financial collapses of the 1990 &quot; s , and a new global downturn in 2001 . 
Such traumatic events plunged these countries into the so-called &quot; middle-income trap &quot; : unable to grow nor to continue broadening their middle classes . 
But , by the second half of the 2000 &quot; s , everything changed : prolonged macroeconomic stability , competent center-left or center-right governments , sensible social policies , and global economic growth allowed countries like Mexico , Brazil , Chile , Uruguay , and even Argentina to take the next giant step . 
By 2008 or so , around 55 % of these countries &quot; populations belonged to the middle class , by whatever definition one used . 
Access to credit , more jobs , remittances , the commodity boom , and conditional cash transfers enabled millions to purchase a home , a car , and a better life . 
This was not a middle class modeled on North Atlantic precedents , and its members &quot; status is precarious and reversible ; moreover , their standard of living is well below that of their counterparts in wealthier countries . 
But a middle class it is . 
These middle-income sectors make up an even larger part of the electorate , since their turnout rates are higher than those of the poor . 
Political candidates must engage them , occasionally pander to them , and tailor their message to them , all of which steers leaders and parties toward moderate positions . 
There are no guarantees that this will endure , but it is one of the region &apos;s most impressive achievements in recent years . 
Latin America will witness two important elections in 2012 , in Venezuela and Mexico , and one non-election , in Cuba . 
In Venezuela , President Hugo Chávez &apos;s opponents will unite behind a single candidate for October &apos;s presidential election . 
But everything depends on Chávez &apos;s health , which , like that of Fidel Castro in Cuba a closely guarded state secret . 
Will Chávez &apos;s cancer allow him to run ( he is as formidable a campaigner as he is a terrible economic manager ) , win , and govern until 2030 ? 
Will he be a stand-in for his more radical brother ( and designated successor ) , Adán ? 
Or will he be too ill to participate ? 
In that case - and most importantly - would he , Adán , and the entire &quot; Bolivarian &quot; elite accept defeat at the polls ? 
In Cuba , there will be no elections , but matters may come to a head next year . 
Raúl Castro &apos;s economic reforms have either not been implemented , or are not delivering the expected results ; the island continues to depend on Venezuelan subsidies , remittances from Miami , and European tourists . 
Cuba &apos;s octogenarian ruling brothers cannot last forever . 
Something may have to give on the island , especially if their Venezuelan benefactor is no longer in power . 
Then there is Mexico , which will hold only its fourth democratic election in its history in a context of rampant organized crime , appalling violence , and rising skepticism about President Felipe Calderón &apos;s war on drugs . 
With three contending parties , a terrible electoral law , no run-off , and condiderable frustration with 12 years of center-right , often ineffective governments , the outcome is highly uncertain . 
That said , Mexico &apos;s political institutions have survived hard times , the middle class rejects extremism , and the US is close by . 
One would prefer to see Mexico &apos;s presidential candidates offer platforms with ideas and proposals that respond to the challenges facing the country , but this substance deficit occurs everywhere now , almost all the time . 
For a region that has suffered so long from frustration and despair over its failures , these are among the best of times . 
Latin America should count its blessings , and remember that nothing lasts forever .
