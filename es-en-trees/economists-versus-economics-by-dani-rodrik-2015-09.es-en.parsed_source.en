Economists vs. Economics 
CAMBRIDGE - Ever since the late nineteenth century , when economics , increasingly embracing mathematics and statistics , developed scientific pretensions , its practitioners have been accused of a variety of sins . 
The charges - including hubris , neglect of social goals beyond incomes , excessive attention to formal techniques , and failure to predict major economic developments such as financial crises - have usually come from outsiders , or from a heterodox fringe . 
Paul Krugman , a Nobel laureate who also writes a newspaper column , has made a habit of slamming the latest generation of models in macroeconomics for neglecting old-fashioned Keynesian truths . 
Paul Romer , one of the originators of new growth theory , has accused some leading names , including the Nobel laureate Robert Lucas , of what he calls &quot; mathiness &quot; - using math to obfuscate rather than clarify . 
Richard Thaler , a distinguished behavioral economist at the University of Chicago , has taken the profession to task for ignoring real-world behavior in favor of models that assume people are rational optimizers . 
This kind of critical examination by the discipline &apos;s big names is healthy and welcome - especially in a field that has often lacked much self-reflection . 
I , too , have taken aim at the discipline &apos;s sacred cows - free markets and free trade - often enough . 
But there is a disconcerting undertone to this new round of criticism that needs to be made explicit - and rejected . 
Economics is not the kind of science in which there could ever be one true model that works best in all contexts . 
The point is not &quot; to reach a consensus about which model is right , &quot; as Romer puts it , but to figure out which model applies best in a given setting . 
The social world differs from the physical world because it is man-made and hence almost infinitely malleable . 
So , unlike the natural sciences , economics advances scientifically not by replacing old models with better ones , but by expanding its library of models , with each shedding light on a different social contingency . 
For example , we now have many models of markets with imperfect competition or asymmetric information . 
These models have not made their predecessors , based on perfect competition , obsolete or irrelevant . 
They have simply made us more aware that different circumstances call for different models . 
Similarly , behavioral models that emphasize heuristic decision-making make us better analysts of environments where such considerations may be important . 
They do not displace rational-choice models , which remain the go-to tool in other settings . 
A growth model that applies to advanced countries may be a poor guide in developing countries . 
Models that emphasize expectations are sometimes best for analyzing inflation and unemployment levels ; at other times , models with Keynesian elements will do a superior job . 
Jorge Luis Borges , the Argentine writer , once wrote a short story - a single paragraph - that is perhaps the best guide to the scientific method . 
In it , he described a distant land where cartography - the science of making maps - was taken to ridiculous extremes . 
A map of a province was so detailed that it was the size of an entire city . 
The map of the empire occupied an entire province . 
In time , the cartographers became even more ambitious : they drew a map that was an exact , one-to-one replica of the whole empire . 
As Borges wryly notes , subsequent generations could find no practical use for such an unwieldy map . 
Borges &apos;s point still eludes many social scientists today : understanding requires simplification . 
The best way to respond to the complexity of social life is not to devise ever-more elaborate models , but to learn how different causal mechanisms work , one at a time , and then figure out which ones are most relevant in a particular setting . 
We use one map if we are driving from home to work , another one if we are traveling to another city . 
Yet other kinds of maps are needed if we are on a bike , on foot , or planning to take public transport . 
Navigating among economic models - choosing which one will work better - is considerably more difficult than choosing the right map . 
Practitioners use a variety of formal and informal empirical methods with varying skill . 
And , in my forthcoming book Economics Rules , I criticize economics training for not properly equipping students for the empirical diagnostics that the discipline requires . 
But the profession &apos;s internal critics are wrong to claim that the discipline has gone wrong because economists have yet to reach consensus on the &quot; correct &quot; models ( their preferred ones of course ) . 
Let us cherish economics in all its diversity - rational and behavioral , Keynesian and Classical , first-best and second-best , orthodox and heterodox - and devote our energy to becoming wiser at picking which framework to apply when .
