Let Africa Into the Carbon Market 
The G8 summit earlier this year focused on Africa and climate change because the two issues are linked : Africa is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and therefore must be supported to adapt to it . 
Adaptation to climate change is critical worldwide , but nowhere as much as in Africa , where exposure to natural disasters is higher than in most other regions . 
Aside from adaptation , Africa can also play a role in mitigating climate change through more sustainable forest and land management . 
Rural populations from Africa have the capacity to compete and export greenhouse-gas emission-reduction credits generated by forestry and agriculture activities that improve their livelihoods , ameliorate local environmental problems , and increase communities &quot; ability to cope with climate change . 
However , in order to fulfill that promise , the industrialized world must give Africa a chance through the emerging international carbon market . 
The best approach would be for Europe , Japan , and Canada to buy certificates of biological carbon sequestration from Africa as part of their efforts to meet their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol . 
Under the Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) of the Kyoto Protocol , industrialized countries ( so-called &quot; Annex I countries &quot; ) have the right to purchase certificates of carbon sequestration from reforestation projects undertaken in developing countries and use them to offset up to 1 % of their 1990 greenhouse-gas emissions from industry , transport and housing . 
Although this represents a small fraction of the effort needed from industrialized countries to fulfill the Kyoto Protocol &apos;s goals by 2012 , it would help significantly in improving forest and land use in Africa . 
Europe , in particular , can demonstrate its commitment to mitigating climate change and promoting economic development in Africa by filling its 1 % quota of credits from reforestation projects . 
This requires modifying some of the rules governing its own internal carbon market , the EU Emission Trading Scheme ( EU ETS ) . 
Under current EU ETS rules , carbon credits generated by forestry projects undertaken in the CDM currently have no value , despite their obvious climate , environmental , and social benefits . 
This is because the so-called &quot; linking directive &quot; - the regulation authorizing EU firms to import Certified Emission Reductions from CDM projects - bans credits from any forestry project . 
Unsurprisingly , no European firm is currently interested in purchasing such credits . 
Even European governments , which are not tied by the EU ETS ban , purchase very few . 
The EU ETS &apos;s exclusion of carbon credits from forestry projects will remain in force at least until 2008 , with the question of whether to include them subsequently set to be revisited next year . 
The European Commission will submit a report for consideration by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers by June 30 , 2006 . 
Preserving the European bias against credits from forest projects is not justified , as positive experience emerging from the first land-use projects will show . 
In the Doha trade negotiations , industrialized nations accepted the need to liberalize their agricultural markets by reducing subsidies to domestic producers and tariff barriers on agricultural imports . 
So why not liberalize the carbon market as well - a move that would help , not hurt , domestic producers ? 
It would also help if all the parties to the Kyoto Protocol amended the post-2012 CDM rules . 
In particular , three changes are necessary : the relaxation of the 1 % rule , the expansion of eligibility criteria to include more than just reforestation , and the removal of the 60-year replacement rule ( which mandates the replacement of temporary with permanent credits after 60 years , regardless of the state of the underlying forests ) . 
The first change would enable Annex I countries to satisfy a greater share of their increasing climate responsibilities using credits from land-use projects implemented in non-Annex I countries . 
The third change would eliminate a perverse rule , by which parties to CDM contracts can liquidate forests to buy replacement credits . 
The responsibility for reforming the emerging carbon market does not lie solely with the North . 
All parties to the Kyoto Protocol , including African nations , have a unique opportunity to influence the post-2012 debate and defend the inclusion of land-use projects in the emerging carbon market .
