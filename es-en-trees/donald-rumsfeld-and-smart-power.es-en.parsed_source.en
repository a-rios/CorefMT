Donald Rumsfeld and Smart Power 
Donald Rumsfeld , America &apos;s Secretary of Defense , recently spoke about the Bush administration &apos;s global war on terror . 
&quot; In this war , some of the most critical battles may not be in the mountains of Afghanistan or the streets of Iraq , but in newsrooms in New York , London , Cairo , and elsewhere . 
Our enemies have skillfully adapted to fighting wars in the media age , but for the most part we have not . &quot; 
The good news is that Rumsfeld is beginning to realize that the struggle against terrorism cannot be won by hard military power alone . 
The bad news is that he still does not understand soft power - the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion . 
As The Economist commented about Rumsfeld &apos;s speech , &quot; until recently he plainly regarded such a focus on &quot; soft power &quot; as , well , soft - part of &quot; Old Europe &apos;s &quot; appeasement of terrorism . &quot; 
Now Rumsfeld finally realizes the importance of winning hearts and minds , but , as The Economist put it , &quot; a good part of his speech was focused on how with slicker PR America could win the propaganda war . &quot; 
In other words , in blaming the media for America &apos;s problems , Rumsfeld forgot the first rule of marketing : if you have a poor product , not even the best advertising will sell it . 
Rumsfeld &apos;s mistrust of the European approach contains a grain of truth . 
Europe has used the attractiveness of its Union to obtain outcomes it wants , just as the US has acted as though its military pre-eminence could solve all problems . 
But it is a mistake to count too much on hard or soft power alone . 
The ability to combine them effectively is &quot; smart power . &quot; 
During the Cold War , the West used hard power to deter Soviet aggression , while it used soft power to erode faith in Communism behind the iron curtain . 
That was smart power . 
To be smart today , Europe should invest more in its hard-power resources , and America should pay more attention to its soft power . 
During President George W. Bush &apos;s first term , Secretary of State Colin Powell understood and referred to soft power , whereas Rumsfeld , when asked about soft power in 2003 , replied &quot; I don &apos;t know what it means . &quot; 
A high price was paid for that ignorance . 
Fortunately , in his second term , with Condoleezza Rice and Karen Hughes at the State Department and Rumsfeld &apos;s reputation dented by failures that in the private sector would have led to his firing or resignation , Bush has shown an increased concern about America &apos;s soft power . 
Of course , soft power is no panacea . 
For example , soft power got nowhere in attracting the Taliban government away from its support for Al Qaeda in the 1990 &quot; s . 
It took hard military power to sever that tie . 
Similarly , North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il likes to watch Hollywood movies , but that is unlikely to affect his decision about whether to give up his nuclear weapons program . 
Such a choice will be determined by hard power , particularly if China agrees to economic sanctions . 
Nor will soft power be sufficient to stop Iran &apos;s nuclear program , though the legitimacy of the Bush administration &apos;s current multilateral approach may help to recruit other countries to a coalition that isolates Iran . 
But other goals , such as promoting democracy and human rights , are better achieved by soft power . 
Coercive democratization has its limits , as the US has learned in Iraq . 
This does not mean that Rumsfeld &apos;s Pentagon is irrelevant to American soft power . 
Military force is sometimes treated as synonymous with hard power , but the same resource can sometimes contribute to soft power . 
A well-run military can be a source of attraction , and military cooperation and training programs can establish transnational networks that enhance a country &apos;s soft power . 
The US military &apos;s impressive work in providing humanitarian relief after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 helped restore America &apos;s attractiveness , and enhanced its soft power . 
But the misuse of military resources can also undercut soft power . 
The Soviet Union possessed a great deal of soft power in the years after World War II . 
But the Soviets &quot; attractiveness as liberators was destroyed by the way they later used their hard power against Hungary and Czechoslovakia . 
Brutality and indifference to &quot; just war &quot; principles of discrimination and proportionality can also destroy legitimacy . 
The efficiency of the initial American military invasion of Iraq in 2003 created admiration in the eyes of some foreigners . 
But this soft power was undercut by the inefficiency of the occupation , the mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib , and the policy - initiated by Rumsfeld - of detainment without hearings at Guant√°namo . 
To be sure , no one expects that we can ever attract people like Mohammed Attta or Osama bin Laden . 
We need hard power to deal with such cases . 
But today &apos;s terrorist threat is not Samuel Huntington &apos;s clash of civilizations . 
It is a civil war within Islam between a majority of normal people and a small minority who want to coerce others into a accepting a highly ideological and politicized version of their religion . 
We cannot win unless the moderates win . 
We cannot win unless the number of people the extremists recruit is lower than the number we kill and deter . 
Rumsfeld may understand this calculus in principle , but his words and actions show that he does not know how to balance the equation in practice . 
Doing so - and thus being in a position to win the war - is impossible without soft power .
