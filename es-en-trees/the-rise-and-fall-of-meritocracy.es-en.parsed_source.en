The Rise and Fall of Meritocracy 
Meritocracy : the word sounds nothing but good . 
It means rule by those who have merit . 
Such merit is usually understood to be academic achievement , a combination of talent and training . 
Who would not wish to live in a meritocracy ? 
It is certainly preferable to a plutocracy , in which wealth determines status , or a gerontocracy , in which age leads one to the top , or even an aristocracy , in which what counts are inherited titles and properties . 
So meritocracy seems preferable , at least at first sight . 
But , on closer inspection , things are not so simple . 
For many , France has long been the epitome of meritocracy . 
Most of those in the top reaches of not only the civil service and the judiciary , but also politics , business , and academia used to be graduates of the famous grandes Ã©coles . 
Many then went through the rigorous training to become inspecteurs de finance , senior state officials . 
Yet the French elites today are increasingly held in suspicion , and even reviled , by part of the population . 
Certainly , French leaders are not immune to corruption . 
The uneasy relationship of money and politics has given rise to several high-profile scandals in recent years . 
It is no longer clear that France &apos;s highly educated leaders are better able to run the country &apos;s affairs more efficiently and more honestly than others . 
Japan &apos;s meritocratically selected bureaucracy , too , faces much the same public opprobrium . 
Indeed , the bureaucracy itself is often blamed for the country &apos;s rigidity and ongoing stagnation . 
In Britain , a government heading for its third term in office has said more than once that it wants the country to be &quot; meritocratic . &quot; 
Chancellor Gordon Brown , Tony Blair &apos;s heir apparent , is particularly eager to go down that road . 
Yet it was a British social scientist ( and Labour Party politician ) , Michael Young , who forty years ago wrote a much debated book entitled The Rise of the Meritocracy . 
His was not a description of the road to the promised land , but a dystopian vision of almost Orwellian dimensions . 
Meritocracy was Young &apos;s &quot; 1984 . &quot; 
Two central questions raised by Young remain topical today . 
First , if academic achievement is the entry ticket to power and status , what about the rest ? 
What about those who do not make it to university ? 
How do the other 50 % fare in a meritocratic world ? 
They are , Young argued , confined , even condemned to lower-level jobs , with no chance to rise to eminence , or even to a comfortable position of responsibility . 
According to Young , those who have at least some talent will form a &quot; pioneer corps &quot; of plumbers and builders and other skilled workers . 
Those who do not even make that grade will remain in a &quot; home help corps &quot; of unskilled laborers . 
Young &apos;s bleak picture bears an eerie resemblance to today &apos;s world . 
The new underclass is the other side of the meritocratic elite . 
Immigrants , in particular , do not enjoy the equality of opportunity that the word &quot; merit &quot; suggests . 
Indeed , nowadays meritocracy seems to be simply another version of the inequality that characterises all societies . 
It may in fact be a particularly cruel form of inequality , as those who do not succeed cannot argue that they were unlucky or kept down by those in power . 
Instead , they must conclude that they personally failed , and that no amount of effort can save them . 
To this must be added another feature that Young described : meritocracy means only that another ruling group closes the gates behind it once it has achieved its status . 
Those who made it on &quot; merit &quot; now want to have everything else as well - not just power and money , but also the opportunity to determine who gets in and who stays out . 
Sooner or later , Young argued , meritocratic elites cease to be open ; they see to it that their children have a better chance than the offspring of the &quot; pioneer corps &quot; or &quot; home help corps . &quot; 
Like all elites before them , they become firmly established - and use all available means to keep it that way . 
There is no need to follow Young &apos;s argument all the way to the eventual revolution . 
There is a need , however , for a healthy skepticism towards the claims of a meritocracy based on academic achievement alone . 
Such a society is not the answer to all our prayers for decency and fairness , or even for sensible and good decisions . 
It is far better to remember that when it comes to leadership , many qualities other than a first-class degree come into play . 
As far as institutions are concerned , we should not allow any one criterion to determine who gets to the top and who does not . 
Diversity is a better guarantee of openness than even merit , and openness is the real hallmark of a liberal order .
