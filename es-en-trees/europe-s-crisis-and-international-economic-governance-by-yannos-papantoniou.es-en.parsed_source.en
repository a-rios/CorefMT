Globalization &apos;s European Test 
ATHENS - The eurozone &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis represents a significant challenge for Europe and the global economy . 
The integration of markets in recent decades , coupled with enormous technological progress in communications and transport , has diffused growth to regions that for centuries lagged behind the dramatic rise in living standards witnessed in Europe , North America , and Japan since the Industrial Revolution . 
More efficient use of global resources allowed productivity to grow , lifting billions of people out of poverty and into the modern world . 
The downside is that national control over economic policy has been significantly diminished , while international economic governance confronts new problems . 
As markets integrate and systems converge , addressing imbalances in either the real economy or the financial sector becomes increasingly difficult , owing to the constraints on multilateral policy cooperation built into institutional arrangements designed for nationally-bounded economies . 
Over the last decade , large external imbalances were allowed to emerge within the eurozone . 
The competitive position of peripheral member countries - particularly Greece , Spain , Portugal , Ireland , and Italy - deteriorated sharply vis-Ã -vis the core countries . 
Governments in the periphery turned a blind eye to credit-fueled bubbles and public or private debt , and failed to adopt counter-cyclical fiscal measures or promote structural reforms to improve competitiveness . 
Large external deficits were matched by surpluses in core countries , whose excess savings then flowed back to the periphery , in turn permitting excessive borrowing and leading to fiscal blowouts . 
Greece was the first country to seek financial assistance from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund , with a bailout program negotiated in May 2010 . 
Exceptionally harsh austerity measures included sharp tax increases and cuts in public-sector salaries and pensions . 
Structural reforms - particularly privatization , market liberalization , opening up closed professions , and downsizing the government sector - were either neglected or poorly monitored . 
The result was a deep and prolonged recession , limited gains in competitiveness , and missed fiscal-deficit targets . 
Poor design and implementation of the adjustment programs undoubtedly has contributed significantly to the persistence of crisis conditions . 
However , debt growth exposed a critical flaw in the eurozone &apos;s economic constitution : national debts are member countries &quot; responsibility , but the common currency lacks a sovereign . 
Unlike most monetary authorities , the European Central Bank cannot act as a lender of last resort , which , together with the absence of common bonds ( Eurobonds ) , induced large-scale speculation on member states &quot; national debt , reflected in widening interest-rate spreads . 
Resolving the crisis inevitably includes action on two fronts . 
The over-indebted countries must address the causes of the persistent imbalances by implementing structural reforms that liberalize markets and encourage wage flexibility . 
Given its specific history , Europe cannot emulate the United States &quot; model of a functioning economic union . 
Nonetheless , in order to make the currency union work , Europe should take decisive steps in that direction . 
This means centralizing European debt through Eurobonds , mobilizing sufficient rescue funds , allowing the ECB to intervene in the primary bond markets , and establishing both a fiscal and a banking union . 
However , the unification agenda lacks universal support . 
The issuance of Eurobonds would imply subsidizing debt-service costs for less creditworthy countries , raising the specter of a &quot; transfer economy &quot; - poorer countries &quot; permanent dependence on rich countries &quot; assistance - which Germany strongly opposes . 
Fiscal union would also include common taxation , implying a loss of sovereignty . 
Such fears are reinforced by the prospect of extending unification to the political sphere in order to give supranational governing institutions sufficient democratic legitimacy . 
This could involve popular election of the European Commission president and strengthening the European Parliament &apos;s powers while diminishing those of the intergovernmental European Council . 
This , coupled with weak reform efforts in the over-indebted countries , goes a long way toward explaining Europe &apos;s inability to overcome the crisis and set a course for economic recovery and steady growth . 
But the eurozone crisis is also a globalization crisis . 
In an open , globalized economy , the gap between winners and losers widens as competition intensifies . 
And , as markets integrate and become more interdependent , the need for policy discipline and international cooperation increases . 
A key task is to prevent the emergence of excessive current-account imbalances , which means supporting exchange-rate realignments and appropriate adjustments in fiscal policies . 
A new global financial-services rulebook , including tougher regulation and strengthened supervision , as well as trade liberalization and higher volumes of appropriately targeted development assistance , would also contribute decisively to raising the standards of international economic governance . The challenge for political leaders is to ensure that the current era of rising and more widely diffused prosperity endures , so that humanity &apos;s poorest eventually share the benefits of modern civilization . 
This requires reinforcing international governance institutions , such as the G-20 .
