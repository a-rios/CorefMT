Microeconomics for All 
TOULOUSE - For the last half-century , the world &apos;s leading universities have taught microeconomics through the lens of the Arrow-Debreu model of general competitive equilibrium . 
The model , formalizing a central insight of Adam Smith &apos;s The Wealth of Nations , embodies the beauty , simplicity , and lack of realism of the two fundamental theorems of competitive equilibrium , in contrast to the messiness and complexity of modifications made by economists in an effort to capture better the way the world actually functions . 
In other words , while researchers attempt to grasp complex , real-world situations , students are pondering unrealistic hypotheticals . 
This educational approach stems largely from the sensible idea that a framework for thinking about economic problems is more useful to students than a ragbag of models . 
But it has become burdened with another , more pernicious notion : as departures from the Arrow-Debreu model become more realistic , and thus more complex , they become less suitable for the classroom . 
In other words , &quot; real &quot; microeconomic thinking should be left to the experts . 
To be sure , basic models - for example , theories of monopoly and simple oligopoly , the theory of public goods , or simple asymmetric-information theory - have some educational value . 
But few researchers actually work with them . 
The bread-and-butter theories for microeconomics research - incomplete contracts , two-sided markets , risk analysis , inter-temporal choice , market signaling , financial-market microstructure , optimal taxation , and mechanism design - are far more complicated , and require exceptional finesse to avoid inelegance . 
Given this , they are largely excluded from textbooks . 
In fact , microeconomics textbooks have remained practically unchanged for at least two decades . 
As a result , undergraduate students struggle to understand even the abstracts of papers on the complex representations of microeconomic reality that fill research journals . 
And , in many areas - such as antitrust analysis , auction design , taxation , environmental policy , and industrial and financial regulation - policy applications have come to be considered the domain of specialists . 
This does not have to be the case . 
While it is true that realistic microeconomic models are more complex than their idealized textbook counterparts , grasping them does not necessarily require years of research experience . 
A case in point is the economics of two-sided markets , which involve competition between platforms whose principal &quot; product &quot; consists in connecting two categories of users , who then offer each other network benefits . 
When markets are two-sided , many of the standard assumptions of antitrust analysis no longer hold : market entry can be bad for consumers , exclusive contracts can increase the number of firms in a market , and pricing below cost may not be predatory . 
A survey by David Evans and Richard Schmalensee describes numerous situations in which applying old assumptions could lead to mistakes by , say , an anti-trust regulator with only an undergraduate degree . 
The unmistakable message is , &quot; Don &apos;t try this at home . &quot; 
But every behavioral divergence between two-sided and traditional markets can be understood using simple tools of elementary microeconomics , such as the distinction between substitute and complementary products . 
When producers of substitutes collude , they usually raise prices ; producers of complements , by contrast , collaborate to lower them . 
So , if two platforms that appear to be performing similar services are complementary - for example , because one platform connects consumers with a set of users that helps them to value another set of users more highly - market entry can be bad for consumers . 
In fact , two platforms can even be complementary for one set of users and substitutes for another . 
The different stages of a televised soccer ( football ) tournament , for example , are complementary for viewers and substitutes for advertisers . 
Moreover , exclusive dealing can increase competition by allowing two platforms to occupy distinct market niches , with the alternative being that one drives out the other . 
In short , with a solid understanding of the difference between complements and substitutes , one can do almost everything the fancy models do - without hiring a single expensive expert . 
Undergraduate-level microeconomics should empower students , not alienate them . 
While the Arrow-Debreu model has its value - namely , it explains why an unplanned economy can produce order - it is discouraging for students to find that what they are deemed capable of comprehending offers little insight into real-life situations . 
Restructuring the microeconomics syllabus would send a far more inspiring - and accurate - message : even complex ideas developed by experts can be understood and applied by educated laypeople .
