The Folklore of Buried Memories 
How victims remember trauma is the most controversial issue facing psychology and psychiatry today . 
Many clinical trauma theorists believe that combat , rape , and other terrifying experiences are seemingly engraved on the mind , never to be forgotten . 
Others disagree , arguing that the mind can protect itself by banishing memories of trauma from awareness , making it difficult for victims to remember their most horrific experiences until it is safe to do so many years later . 
While acknowledging that trauma is often all too memorable , these certain clinical trauma theorists assert that a condition known as &quot; traumatic dissociative amnesia &quot; leaves a large minority of victims unable to recall their trauma , precisely because it was so overwhelmingly terrifying . 
However , these clinical trauma theorists do not argue that &quot; repressed &quot; or &quot; dissociated &quot; memories of horrific events are either inert or benign . 
On the contrary , these buried memories silently poison the lives of victims , giving rise to seemingly inexplicable psychiatric symptoms , and therefore must be exhumed for healing to occur . 
This is no ordinary academic debate . 
The controversy has spilled out of the psychology laboratories and psychiatric clinics , capturing headlines , motivating legislative changes , and affecting outcomes in civil lawsuits and criminal trials . 
Whether individuals can repress and recover memories of traumatic sexual abuse has been especially contentious . 
During the 1990 &quot; s , many adult psychotherapy patients began to recall having been sexually abused during childhood . 
Some took legal action against the alleged perpetrators , often their elderly parents . 
While complaints against parents , based on allegedly repressed and recovered memories of abuse , have declined , those against large institutions , such as the Catholic Church , have increased . 
Strikingly , both advocates and skeptics of the concept of traumatic dissociative amnesia adduce the same studies when defending their diametrically opposed views . 
But it is the advocates who misinterpret the data when attempting to show that victims are often unable to recall their traumatic experiences . 
Consider the following . 
After exposure to extreme stress , some victims report difficulties remembering things in everyday life . 
Advocates of traumatic amnesia misconstrue these reports as showing that victims are unable to remember the horrific event itself . 
In reality , this memory problem concerns ordinary absentmindedness that emerges in the wake of trauma ; it does not refer to an inability to remember the trauma itself . 
Ordinary forgetfulness that emerges after a trauma must not be confused with amnesia for the trauma . 
Consider , too , that one symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder is an &quot; inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma . &quot; 
This symptom , however , does not mean that victims are unaware of having been traumatized . 
Indeed , the mind does not operate like a video recorder , and thus not every aspect of a traumatic experience gets encoded into memory in the first place . 
High levels of emotional arousal often result in the victim &apos;s attention being drawn to the central features of the event at the expense of other features . 
Incomplete encoding of a trauma must not be confused with amnesia - an inability to recall something did get into memory . 
Moreover , a rare syndrome called &quot; psychogenic amnesia &quot; is sometimes confused with traumatic amnesia . 
Victims of psychogenic amnesia suddenly lose all memory of their previous lives , including their sense of personal identity . 
Occasionally , this sudden , complete memory loss occurs after severe stress , but not invariably . 
After a few days or weeks , memory abruptly returns . 
In contrast , the phenomenon of dissociative amnesia supposedly entails victims &quot; inability to remember their traumatic experiences , not an inability to remember their entire lives or who they are . 
Several surveys show that adults reporting childhood sexual abuse often say that there was a period of time when they &quot; could not remember &quot; their abuse . 
Claims of prior inability to remember imply that they had attempted unsuccessfully to recall their abuse , only to remember it much later . 
Yet if these individuals were unable to remember their abuse , on what basis would they attempt to recall it in the first place ? 
Most likely , they meant that there was a period of time when they did not think about their abuse . 
But not thinking about something is not the same thing as being unable to remember it . 
It is inability to remember that constitutes amnesia . 
Research conducted in my laboratory on adults reporting histories of childhood sexual abuse provides a solution to this bitter controversy . 
Some of our participants reported having forgotten episodes of nonviolent sexual abuse perpetrated by a trusted adult . 
They described it as having been upsetting , confusing , and disturbing , but not traumatic in the sense of being overwhelmingly terrifying . 
Failing to understand what had happened to them , they simply did not think about it for many years . 
When reminders prompted recollection many years later , they experienced intense distress , finally understanding their abuse from the perspective of an adult . 
These cases count as recovered memories of sexual abuse , but not as instances of traumatic dissociative amnesia . 
That is , the events were not experienced as traumatic when they occurred , and there is no evidence that they were inaccessible during the years when they never came to mind . 
Sexual abuse is not invariably traumatic in the sense of being overwhelmingly terrifying . 
Of course , it is always morally reprehensible , even when it fails to produce lasting psychiatric symptoms .
