Unfreezing Europe \ u0027s Northern Dimension 
COPENHAGEN : Slowly , ever so slowly , Europe is establishing its new political geography . 
Enlargement of the European Union to include the first batch of applicant countries is now within reach as more and more chapters are closed in the bilateral negotiations . 
The biggest remaining hurdle concerns the political will among today &apos;s EU members to set the actual dates for enlargement . 
Later this year , in Prague , NATO &apos;s leaders may also give the green light to the next group of new members . 
So 2001 can be a crucial year in the never-ending story of the creation of a new and better Europe . 
This is why relations with Russia must also be placed high on Europe &apos;s agenda this year . 
If you look at the new map of Europe , it is obvious where the focus must be : Northwest Russia already shares borders with both the EU and NATO ( a fact often missed by those who argue against &quot; expanding NATO right up to the borders of Russia &quot; ) . 
This proximity offers the prospect of friction or , if Europe seizes the moment , the most promising of possibilities for economic growth . 
After all , Russia &apos;s reforms , many of Russia &apos;s leading reformers , and President Putin himself all began their careers in St. Petersburg . 
The &quot; Northern Dimension , &quot; a concept developed during Finland &apos;s EU-presidency of two years ago , has been picked up by the present Swedish presidency . 
On April 9th , foreign ministers from the EU , Russia , and other countries from the Baltic Sea Region will meet in Luxembourg to review implementation of the so-called Northern Dimension Action Plan and provide political guidance for developing this initiative . 
An injection of renewed purpose from the EU &apos;s political leaders is undoubtedly needed . 
Such could provide inspiration for the entire region , including its postcommunist countries , where a huge potential for growth exists . 
The driving force , however , can only be an understanding that EU enlargement must be regarded as a win-win situation for all countries involved directly or indirectly - including Russia . 
For Russia has legitimate and undeniable interests at stake . 
Think of the Kaliningrad-oblast . 
With Lithuania &apos;s independence it was cut off by land from Russia . 
Soon , it may appear even more isolated to Russians , as Poland and Lithuania enforce the EU &apos;s Schengen border rules . 
To secure regional stability , Russia must be convinced that all countries have the right to choose the international organisations in which they wish to be members . 
So Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania cannot be regarded as special Russian &quot; spheres of influence &quot; requiring Russian assent for membership in either the EU or NATO . 
Yet , to obtain that kind of understanding , Russia must be able to see its own interests - in particular the economic health of Kaliningrad and Northwest Russia - taken into account as the EU enlarges . 
So co-operation between Russia and the EU must be extended on many practical issues . 
Unleashing the potential for growth in the Baltic Sea Region is one powerful way to achieve this end . 
Governments and think-tanks in the region are already pointing the way ahead . 
A recent study presented at the Baltic Development Forum suggested that , if Poland and the three Baltic countries become EU members in 2003 and continue their efforts to catch up economically with the rest of the Union , annual growth in their GDP can be 2-4 % higher than the EU-average . 
In the coming decade , Poland might double its GDP , the Baltic countries increase their GDP by 60 % . 
The benefits of such growth for present regional EU members will more than outweigh the direct budget costs linked to enlargement . 
So : a win-win situation . 
But EU-enlargement alone will not do the trick . 
A comprehensive strategy is needed to realise the region &apos;s full potential . 
Here Professor Michael Porter of Harvard University has proposed a &quot; Baltic Rim Regional Agenda &quot; to develop an innovative and co-operative mindset to improve the region &apos;s business development . 
In it , private business takes the driver &apos;s seat in the economic and political transition . 
But private business can only meet that challenge if governments are prepared to remove the many barriers that exist to growth and free trade . 
In the past , the Baltic Sea Region was one of Europe &apos;s most economically dynamic areas . 
Trade and cultural exchanges flourished . 
Then came years of Cold War division . 
Half of the Baltic Sea became an economic dead sea . 
When Europe &apos;s division ended , an opportunity to recreate the Baltic &apos;s traditional free movements of people , ideas and merchandise - all of which once contributed mightily to regional prosperity - suddenly appeared . 
The importance of seizing this opportunity cannot be overstated . 
Indeed , Immanuel Kant &apos;s old imperative - that trade is peace-making - should not be forgotten . 
Special resonance is added to this thought by the fact that Kant himself was born in what used to be K &quot; nigsberg , now Russia &apos;s Kaliningrad . 
Much talk will be heard in coming months : the ministerial meeting in Luxembourg , numerous conferences and seminars around the region , and in September a Baltic summit will be held in St. Petersburg at which political and business leaders will discuss what is needed in order to move ahead . 
All this talk is essential and good . 
EU enlargement - and the process of involving Russia - must not be slowed by a lack of political will and vision among European leaders .
