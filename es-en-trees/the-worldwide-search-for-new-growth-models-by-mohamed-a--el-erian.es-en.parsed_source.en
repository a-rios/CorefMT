The Global Growth Quest 
NEWPORT BEACH - What is the most urgent economic priority shared by countries as diverse as Brazil , China , Cyprus , France , Greece , Iceland , Ireland , Korea , Portugal , the United Kingdom , and the United States ? 
It is not debt and deficits ; and it is not dealing with the aftermath of irresponsible lending and borrowing . 
Yes , these are relevant and , in a handful of cases , urgent . 
For both theoretical and practical reasons , this is a challenge that will not be met easily or quickly . 
The last few years have highlighted the declining potency of long-standing growth models . 
Some countries ( for example , Greece and Portugal ) relied on debt-financed government spending to fuel economy activity . 
Others ( think Cyprus , Iceland , Ireland , the UK , and the US ) resorted to unsustainable surges in leverage among financial institutions to fund private-sector activities , sometimes almost irrespective of underlying fundamentals . 
Still others ( China and Korea ) exploited seemingly limitless globalization and buoyant international trade to capture growing market shares . 
Recent data from the International Monetary Fund highlight these models &quot; simultaneous loss of effectiveness . 
Global growth averaged only 2.9 % in the most recent five-year period , well below the level for virtually any such multi-year period going back to 1971 . 
While emerging economies have out-performed developed countries , both have slowed . 
Growth has been virtually flat in developed economies and , at 5.6 % in the emerging world , is well below the 7.6 % average in the previous five-year period . 
Highly leveraged systems in finance-dependent economies were the first to hit a wall , surprising many who had uncritically bought into the &quot; Great Moderation &quot; - the idea that macroeconomic and asset-market volatility had eased permanently . 
The bold policy action that countered the initial disorder prevented a global depression , but it encumbered public-sector balance sheets . 
As a result , highly indebted governments were the next to hit the wall . 
Some were pushed there by the high cost of containing the damage from banks &quot; irresponsible behavior . 
Facing immediate credit rationing and large output contractions , they could be stabilized only by exceptional official financing from abroad , and , in some extreme cases , by defaulting on past commitments ( including to bondholders and , most recently , bank depositors ) . 
For other countries , including the US , medium-term issues came to the fore . 
But , rather than catalyzing sensible policy discussions , these issues played into polarized and polarizing politics , creating new and more immediate headwinds to economic growth . 
Meanwhile , a highly interdependent and ( now ) less dynamic world economy has been limiting the scope for external growth drivers . 
Accordingly , even countries with sound balance sheets and manageable leverage have experienced a growth slowdown . 
The consequences have become painfully clear , especially in Western countries . 
With insufficient growth to deleverage safely , social costs have been considerable . 
Alarmingly high youth unemployment , shrinking social safety nets , and under-investment in infrastructure and human capital are burdening current generations and , in a growing number of cases , will adversely affect future generations as well . 
In the process , inequality has risen further . 
With the political context undermining the right mix of short- and longer-term measures , national policymaking has stumbled into partial approaches and unusual experimentation . 
The focus has been on buying time , rather than on implementing a sensible transition to a sustainable policy stance . 
The regional and multilateral dimensions are similarly inadequate . 
The absence of well-articulated common analyses and policy coordination has accentuated legitimacy deficits , encouraging leaders and publics to opt for partial narratives and eroding confidence in existing institutional structures . 
Given these trends , the search for more robust growth models will take much longer and be more complicated than many recognize - especially as the world economy pivots away from unfettered globalization and high levels of leverage . 
We should expect countries like the US to benefit from dynamic bottom-up entrepreneurship and traditional cyclical economic healing . 
Notwithstanding a dysfunctional Congress , the private sector will increasingly convert a paralyzing uncertainty premium , which impedes much investment , into a less disruptive risk premium . 
Governments &quot; role will be different in countries like China , where officials will guide a shift from dependence on external sources of growth to more balanced demand . 
The outlook for other economies is more uncertain . 
Undermined by a lack of policy flexibility , it will take a long time for countries like Cyprus to overcome the immediate shock of crisis and revamp their growth models . 
Left to their own devices , these multi-speed dynamics would translate into higher global growth overall , coupled with larger internal and cross-country disparities - often exacerbated by demographics . 
The question is whether existing governance systems can coordinate effective intervention to counter the resulting tensions . 
Simultaneous progress on both substance and process is needed . 
Parliaments and multilateral institutions must do a better job at facilitating cooperative policy implementation , which will require a willingness to reform outmoded institutions , including political lobbying . 
No one should underestimate the growth challenge facing today &apos;s global economy . 
The stronger sectors ( within countries and across them ) will continue to recover , but not enough to pull up the global economy whole As a result , weaker sectors risk being surpassed at an ever-faster pace . 
These trends will become more difficult to reconcile and keep orderly if governance systems fail to adjust .
