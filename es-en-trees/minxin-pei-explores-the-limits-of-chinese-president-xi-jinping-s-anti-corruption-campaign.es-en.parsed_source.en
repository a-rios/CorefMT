Hunting Tigers in China 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - In the boldest move yet since President Xi Jinping launched his anti-corruption campaign , China has announced the start of a formal investigation into &quot; serious disciplinary violations &quot; by one of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s most senior figures , Zhou Yongkang . 
Though rumors of Zhou &apos;s political demise had been circulating for nearly a year , anyone familiar with Chinese political intrigue knew that , until the CCP made it official , Zhou &apos;s many powerful patrons and cronies could still save him . 
Now it is official : a &quot; mega-tiger &quot; has been brought down . 
But is that what China really needs ? 
Since 2012 , when Xi began &quot; hunting tigers , &quot; as he put it , three dozen government ministers , provincial governors , and other high-level officials have fallen into his net . 
But Zhou is no ordinary tiger . 
Since the end of the Cultural Revolution , the CCP has adhered to the implicit rule that members of the Politburo Standing Committee , sitting or retired , enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution . 
Some have , of course , been purged in power struggles , such as the one that led to the fall of Hua Guofeng , Mao &apos;s immediate successor , in the early 1980s . 
But the defeated have typically retired quietly , and never faced formal corruption charges . 
Given this history , the prosecution of Zhou is a watershed event - far more significant than the riveting trial of the disgraced former Chongqing Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai a year ago . 
It unambiguously demonstrates Xi &apos;s personal authority and political resolve . 
The conventional wisdom is that the threat of prosecution serves Xi &apos;s goals of consolidating power and compelling the bureaucracy to implement economic reforms that run counter to its interests . 
The two prongs of Xi &apos;s political strategy - cleansing the Party and reinvigorating China &apos;s economy - are thus complementary and interdependent . 
This strategy has considerable merit . 
The most successful political leaders are skilled coalition-builders . 
Consider Deng Xiaoping , China &apos;s most successful reformer ( the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 notwithstanding ) . 
The grand coalition that he forged , against all odds , upon his return to power in 1979 was essential to bringing about the economic transformation that followed . 
The question today is thus not whether Xi has amassed enough authority to effect change in China ( he has ) , but whether he has built a coalition capable of advancing his declared goal of reviving pro-market reforms . 
And , so far , the answer seems to be no . 
Since taking over the presidency , Xi &apos;s actions have been both resolute and contradictory . 
On one hand , he has been aggressively pursuing &quot; tigers &quot; and &quot; flies &quot; ( lower-level officials ) , while curbing , at least temporarily , the privileges enjoyed by Chinese officials . 
On the other hand , he has launched an equally ferocious campaign against political liberalization , arresting and jailing leading human-rights activists and cracking down on China &apos;s once-vibrant social media . 
The risks of waging a two-front war are obvious . 
If Xi &apos;s fight against corruption is genuine , it will engender fear and resentment among the Chinese bureaucracy . 
While officials feign compliance with Xi &apos;s economic-reform agenda , they will seek any opportunity to stymie it . 
The absence of significant real progress since Xi unveiled his economic blueprint last November suggests that this is already happening . 
At the same time , Xi &apos;s tough stance against political reform is diminishing hope among liberals . 
Of course , this group - including intellectuals , social activists , journalists , and progressive private entrepreneurs - has little institutional power . 
What it does have is the capacity to influence ordinary Chinese - making them a valuable addition to a pro-reform coalition . 
Deng recognized this potential in the 1980s ; unless Xi follows suit , he will find it increasingly difficult to rally the public behind his vision for China &apos;s future . 
This is not to say that caging Zhou was not a good move . 
His long-term success - and that of China - depends on it .
