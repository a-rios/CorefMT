The Collapsing Arab State 
BOSTON - The so-called Arab Spring generated a wave of hope among those fighting or advocating for democratization of the Arab world &apos;s authoritarian regimes . 
Now , following leadership changes in Tunisia , Egypt , Libya , and Yemen , and with a brutal civil war raging in Syria and increasingly fraught conditions in Bahrain , Sudan , Jordan , and Iraq , there is much talk of a major shift - and hope for improvement - in the nature and prospects of the Arab state . 
But hope - &quot; the thing with feathers , &quot; as the American poet Emily Dickinson put it - often bears little resemblance to realities on the ground . 
Indeed , looking earthward , the beauty of the Arab Spring seems to have given way to an almost unbearable winter . 
For all the optimism ushered in two years ago , ominous political realities may be rendering the nation-state system incompatible with the emerging new Arab world . 
As a result , how the region can maintain stability without stable nation-states is becoming a burning question . 
Admittedly , Arab countries &quot; problems vary by degree and type . 
Some countries , such as Egypt and Tunisia , have historically entrenched institutions to help steer the post-conflict institution-building process and prevent a complete collapse of the state . 
Others , like Bahrain and Jordan , appear to be relatively stable . 
Moreover , each country has elected leaders ( or widely supported rebels ) with ties to the pan-Arab revolutionary Islamist movement the Muslim Brotherhood ( or , in the case of Bahrain , to Iran &apos;s revolutionary Islamist objectives ) . 
They are thus subject to a religious ideology that transcends the nation-state , rather than to organizations with viable plans for social stability , economic prosperity , and political security within national borders . 
The vulnerability that this implies already has resulted in Sudan &apos;s recent disintegration into two states . 
Sudan &apos;s authoritarian rule and social division along religious lines , together with economic difficulties and political ineptitude , precipitated the collapse of the central government &apos;s authority in the country &apos;s Christian-majority south . 
The same process appears to be playing out , albeit at a slower pace , in Iraq , amid an ongoing struggle to unite two ethnicities , Arabs and Kurds , as well as adherents of Sunni and Shia Islam , into a single nation-state . 
Central authority is gradually eroding as the country continues to splinter into ethnic and sectarian regions , with a de facto Kurdish sovereign state already well established in the north . 
Meanwhile , in Yemen , the possibility of adequate central authority is slipping away as the country confronts several seemingly intractable problems - from internal divisions and separatist movements to Al Qaeda &apos;s franchise in the Arabian Peninsula and a failing economy . 
The south ( Aden ) and east ( Hadramaut ) are both on a trajectory toward independence , dragging Yemen toward another secession struggle nearly 25 years after the country &apos;s fragile unification . 
In Libya , the collapse of Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s regime has thrown the country into chaos and decimated central-government authority . 
The south remains lawless , while the east is ruled by the Benghazi regional council ; only the west remains subject to the poorly consolidated government in Tripoli . 
The situation is even worse in Syria , where the bloodiest of the Arab revolutions has already claimed more than 75,000 lives , owing mainly to the behavior of President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s tyrannical regime . 
As the Syrian state melts away , the regime &apos;s inevitable collapse will lead to the country &apos;s permanent dismemberment , bringing a de facto Kurdish state in the northeast , an eastern autonomous enclave for the surviving Alawites , and a southern entity for the Druze . 
While the Bahraini and Jordanian states have proven much more stable in relative terms , they are not immune to volatility . 
Certainly , the Shia revolt in Bahrain , hijacked by an opportunistic Iranian revanchist faction , has failed to foment the collapse of the Khalifa monarchy . 
But both states lack the domestic revenues needed to sustain their institutions . 
If they wish to survive well into the next century , they will probably need to be subsumed under a union supported by a larger , more powerful , and more established nation-state . 
Furthermore , the disintegration that the region has already witnessed - and will undoubtedly continue to witness - will reverberate beyond the Arab map with the creation of a sovereign Kurdish state . 
But , more important , everywhere in the Arab world - and beyond - it has called into question the viability of the nation-state .
