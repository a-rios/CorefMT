Are the Good Times Over ? 
STANFORD - In the 25 years before the Great Recession of 2008-2009 , the United States experienced two brief , mild recessions and two strong , long expansions . 
Globally , incomes grew briskly ; inflation abated ; and stock markets boomed . 
Moreover , the recovery from the last major slump , in the early 1980s , brought about a quarter-century of unprecedentedly strong and stable macroeconomic performance . 
This time , however , the return to growth has been much more difficult . 
America &apos;s recovery since the Great Recession , has been inconsistent , with growth repeatedly picking up and then sputtering out . 
In fact , the US has not experienced three consecutive quarters of 3 % growth in a decade . 
Though lower oil prices are helping consumers , this gain is partly offset by less energy investment , and the effects of the stronger dollar will be even larger . 
The US is not alone . 
Though most European economies are now growing again , aided by lower oil prices and currency depreciation , the pace of expansion remains anemic . 
Similarly , Japan &apos;s recovery remains fragile , despite strong efforts by the government . 
Even the major emerging economies , which were supposed to serve as global growth engines in the years ahead , are struggling : China and India have downshifted , and Brazil and Russia are contracting . 
When a boom or bust lasts for such a long time , it begins to seem like it will continue indefinitely . 
Six years after the crisis , some prominent economists are asking whether insufficient investment and / or waning gains from technological innovation have pushed the global economy into a &quot; new normal &quot; of lower growth and slow , if any , gains in living standards . 
Some economists call this &quot; secular stagnation &quot; - a fancy way of saying that the good times are gone for good . 
Are they right ? 
Total economic growth amounts to roughly the sum of the growth of work hours ( an increase in the number of workers or the amount of hours that they work ) and productivity ( output per hour of work ) . 
If productivity improves by one percentage point in a year , the improvement of living standards over the subsequent generation would be augmented by one-third . 
Over time , a productivity improvement of even a fraction of a percentage point would be immensely consequential . 
Productivity can be enhanced by capital investment , technological innovation , and improvements in the knowledge and skills of the labor force , though economists disagree on which has the largest impact . 
According to my research with Larry Lau , technology has played the largest role boosting productivity in the G-7 economies since World War II . 
Given this , America &apos;s declining productivity growth - which has averaged just 0.7 % annually since 2010 - has led some observers to blame the slowdown on inadequate technological advances . 
These pessimists , such as the economist Robert Gordon , claim that new innovations are unlikely to improve productivity as fundamentally as electricity , automobiles , and computers did in the last century . 
Optimists counter that smart phones , Big Data , and expected advances in nanotechnology , robotics , and biosciences are harbingers of a new era of technology-driven productivity improvements . 
It may be impossible to predict the next &quot; killer app , &quot; they argue , but it will always be developed . 
Both sides cite Moore &apos;s Law , named for Intel &apos;s co-founder , Gordon Moore , who noticed that the density of transistors on a chip could be doubled every 18 months . 
The pessimists claim that this is becoming harder and more expensive ; the optimists hold that the law will remain valid , with chips moving to three dimensions . 
Clearly , the trajectory of technological progress is difficult to predict . 
In fact , the main commercial value of new technology is not always apparent even to the inventor . 
When Guglielmo Marconi made the first transatlantic wireless transmission over a century ago , he was competing with the telegraph in point-to-point communication ; he never envisioned popular mass-broadcast radio . 
Thomas Edison designed the phonograph to help the blind - and filed a lawsuit to prevent it from being used to play music . 
Complicating matters further is the fact that the next wave of productivity-enhancing technological developments are likely to occur in sectors such as health care , where their economic impact is difficult to measure . 
Economists believe that many improvements in health-care quality - such as more effective treatments for cataracts or cardiac disease - are not accurately reflected in real GDP , and are incorrectly reported as price increases . 
Better measures for these changes are essential for an accurate assessment of economic progress . 
To be sure , technology-driven growth carries some risks . 
While old fears that automation and artificial intelligence would cause widespread structural unemployment have never been borne out , technology and globalization have put downward pressure on wages for all but the most skilled workers in the advanced economies . 
Capital &apos;s share of national income has increased , while labor &apos;s share has fallen . 
But implementing policies that restrict potentially productivity-enhancing technologies would be a grave mistake . 
To encourage more robust growth and the associated improvements in living standards , governments should ensure that the private sector has sufficient incentives for innovation , entrepreneurship , and investment in physical and human capital . 
For example , officials could cut red tape , rein in deficits and debt , enact tax policies conducive to capital formation , reform the education system , and invest in research and development . 
Of course , no one should expect a return to the pre-crisis boom years , given the demographic pressures that almost all major economies - including China - are facing . 
But these incentives stand the best chance of continuing the flow of productivity-enhancing technology , from startups to the research divisions of established companies in industries from technology to energy to health care .
