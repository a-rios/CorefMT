Paying the Price of Reform 
Angela Merkel &apos;s poor showing in Germany &apos;s recent election has now put into cold storage any hope of a serious overhaul of the country &apos;s famously rigid economy . 
Tony Blair was waiting for her to help launch a drive to make the current British Presidency of the European Union a historical turning point for the Union &apos;s economy . 
Now Blair has no project , and all would-be reformers are most likely downsizing their ambitions . 
Europe appears to be more stuck than ever . 
To start with , the private sector is doing well . 
Technology travels fast and is swiftly adopted . 
Firms have responded to inhospitable conditions by cutting workforces and boosting productivity through more capital-intensive production processes and , when needed , by offshoring their capacities . 
The laggards are to be found only in the service industry , which is largely insulated from international production chains and even from internal European competition . 
More fundamentally , there is no such thing as a &quot; European economy . &quot; 
The Union &apos;s 25 member countries are very diverse . 
The Nordic countries are high-tech leaders ; 
Spain has slashed its unemployment rate by half ( it stood at 25 % not so long ago ) ; and the new members from Central and Eastern Europe are cruising briskly along a steady catch-up path . 
The really sick countries are three of the EU &apos;s four biggest : France , Germany , and Italy . 
But even they have carried out some reforms - not enough and too recently to make a difference yet ; nonetheless , they have started to move . 
More importantly , no one ignores that the old ways have to go if prosperity is to be maintained . 
Except for a fringe of die-hard Marxists - which can still collect up to 10 % of the votes - there is a keen sense that deep reforms are needed to come to grip with the high unemployment and poor growth of the last decade . 
Continuing budget deficits have visibly failed to deliver what die-hard Keynesians had promised . 
These days , no politician dares to suggest that continuing to pile up debt is the way to go , even though few are prepared to articulate a credible plan for fiscal consolidation . 
The problem , of course is that the most urgently needed reforms will hurt a lot of people . 
Most economists agree that high levels of employment protection merely hold down the creation of new jobs rather than reduce joblessness . 
But reducing employment protection scares every worker in the private sector . 
This is understandable , given an unemployment rate of around 10 % in France , Germany , and Italy ; with so few new jobs , becoming unemployed is a major disaster . 
To be sure , comfortable unemployment benefits soften the blow . 
The problem , though , is that some people have even become addicted ; they now aim at living on welfare benefits alone . 
This is why economists want to change the unemployment and welfare systems to raise the incentives to go back to work . 
Successful experience notwithstanding , most people interpret &quot; incentives &quot; as painful kicks in the butt , and they want none of it . 
Then consider these countries &quot; bloated public services , where jobs are guaranteed for life , promotion is by seniority rather than merit , and customers are seen as a nuisance . 
The result is red tape all over and a huge drag on productivity . 
Shaping up the public sector is an obvious goal , but civil servants are adamantly opposed to what would in effect mean new and much less attractive work contracts . 
Economists know that important parts of the population are bound to lose from reform . 
Their answer is that more people stand to benefit , and that the benefits far outweigh the costs . 
This is true , but it provides little solace for the potential losers . 
Reforms are relatively easier in smaller countries , probably because winners and losers are likely to be personally connected to each other as relatives , neighbors , or friends . 
In large countries , the fear of being on the losing side is not outweighed by people &apos;s appreciation that the country as a whole will do better . 
One solution is just to go ahead and reform anyway , regardless of the resistance . 
This is the Thatcher solution , which took almost everyone by surprise . 
Angela Merkel was sometimes called the German Iron Lady , and that seems to have scared enough people to rob her of an expected victory . 
Even if she becomes Chancellor , she has no mandate for deep reform . 
Meanwhile , the French presidential hopeful , Nicolas Sarkozy , who was associating himself with Merkel and articulating a bold reform program , suddenly seems weak . 
Clearly , if reforms are to be carried out in Europe , something else must be tried . 
Here is one idea . 
Why shouldn &apos;t winners compensate the losers ? 
Surely , for example , there is a price tag that can be attached to breaking civil servants &quot; existing work contracts . 
If a fair one-time payment is offered , it is likely to be taken up by a majority of civil servants , and public opinion will frown upon the greedy or lazy ones who turn it down . 
It might be expensive to compensate all potential losers , but we must put our money where our mouth is ; if a reform is certain to pay off handsomely , it will pay for the buy-offs , and more . 
Governments can borrow what they need to pay out now , and service this debt as reforms yield benefits . 
Not only is paying up-front against future benefits efficient and fair , but it also can provide strong incentives for policy makers to weed out bad reforms . 
If a reform is as good as we think it is , then so is public debt to finance its political acceptability .
