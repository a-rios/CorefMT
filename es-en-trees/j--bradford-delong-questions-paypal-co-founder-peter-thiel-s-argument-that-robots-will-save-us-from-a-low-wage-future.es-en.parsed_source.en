The Rise of the Robots 
BERKELEY - For decades , people have been predicting how the rise of advanced computing and robotic technologies will affect our lives . 
On one side , there are warnings that robots will displace humans in the economy , destroying livelihoods , especially for low-skill workers . 
Others look forward to the vast economic opportunities that robots will present , claiming , for example , that they will improve productivity or take on undesirable jobs . 
The venture capitalist Peter Thiel , who recently joined the debate , falls into the latter camp , asserting that robots will save us from a future of high prices and low wages . 
Figuring out which side is right requires , first and foremost , an understanding of the six ways that humans have historically created value : through our legs , our fingers , our mouths , our brains , our smiles , and our minds . 
Our legs and other large muscles move things to where we need them to be , so our fingers can rearrange them into useful patterns . 
Our brains regulate routine activities , keeping the leg- and finger-work on track . 
Our mouths - indeed , our words , whether spoken or written - enable us to inform and entertain one another . 
Our smiles help us to connect with others , ensuring that we pull roughly in the same direction . 
Finally , our minds - our curiosity and creativity - identify and resolve important and interesting challenges . 
Thiel , for his part , refutes the argument - often made by robot doomsayers - that the impact of artificial intelligence and advanced robotics on the labor force will mirror globalization &apos;s impact on advanced-country workers . 
Globalization hurt lower-skill workers in places like the United States , as it enabled people from faraway countries to compete for the leg-and-finger positions in the global division of labor . 
Given that these new competitors demanded lower wages , they were the obvious choice for many companies . 
According to Thiel , the key difference between this phenomenon and the rise of robots lies in consumption . 
Developing-country workers took advantage of the bargaining power that globalization afforded them to gain resources for their own consumption . 
Computers and robots , by contrast , do not consume anything except electricity , even as they complete leg , finger , and even brain activities faster and more efficiently than humans would . 
Here , Thiel offers an example from his experience as CEO of PayPal . 
Instead of having humans scrutinize every item in every batch of 1,000,000 transactions for indications of fraud , PayPal &apos;s computers can approve the obviously legitimate transactions , and pass on the 1,000 or so that could be fraudulent for thoughtful consideration by a human . 
One worker and a computer system can thus do what PayPal would have had to hire 1,000 workers to do a generation ago . 
Given that the computer system does not need things like food , that thousand-fold increase in productivity will redound entirely to the benefit of the middle class . 
Put another way , globalization lowered the wages of low-skill advanced-country workers because others would perform their jobs more cheaply , and then consume the value that they had created . 
Computers mean that higher-skill workers - and the lower-skill workers who remain to oversee the large robotic factories and warehouses - can spend their time on more valuable activities , assisted by computers that demand little . 
Thiel &apos;s argument may be correct . 
In fact , Thiel seems to be running into the old diamonds-and-water paradox - water is essential , but costs nothing , whereas diamonds are virtually useless , but extremely expensive - albeit in a sophisticated and subtle way . 
The paradox exists because , in a market economy , the value of water is set not by the total usefulness of water ( infinite ) or by the average usefulness of water ( very large ) , but by the marginal value of the last drop of water consumed ( very low ) . 
Similarly , the wages and salaries of low- and high-skill workers in the robot-computer economy of the future will not be determined by the ( very high ) productivity of the one lower-skill worker ensuring that all of the robots are in their places or the one high-skill worker reprogramming the software . 
Instead , compensation will reflect what workers outside the highly productive computer-robot economy are creating and earning . 
The newly industrialized city of Manchester , which horrified Friedrich Engels when he worked there in the 1840s , had the highest level of labor productivity the world had ever seen . 
But the factory workers &quot; wages were set not by their extraordinary productivity , but by what they would earn if they returned to the potato fields of pre-famine Ireland . 
So the question is not whether robots and computers will make human labor in the goods , high-tech services , and information-producing sectors infinitely more productive . 
They will . 
What really matters is whether the jobs outside of the robot-computer economy - jobs involving people &apos;s mouths , smiles , and minds - remain valuable and in high demand . 
From 1850 to 1970 or so , rapid technological progress first triggered wage increases in line with productivity gains . 
Then came the protracted process of income-distribution equalization , as machines , installed to substitute for human legs , and fingers created more jobs in machine-minding , which used human brains and mouths , than it destroyed in sectors requiring routine muscle power or dexterity work . 
And rising real incomes increased leisure time , thereby boosting demand for smiles and the products of minds . 
Will the same occur when machines take over routine brainwork ? 
Maybe . 
But it is far from being a safe bet on which to rest an entire argument , as Thiel has .
