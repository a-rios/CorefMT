Europe \ u0027s Solidarity under Siege 
Is the European Union &apos;s solidarity fracturing ? 
After bruising enlargement negotiations and internal differences over Iraq , and with similar divisions surrounding the new EU constitution and the common European foreign and defense policy , one might well think just that . 
Public opinion polls also show a dramatic decline in support for enlargement within the current EU member states . 
Whether or not the crisis of European solidarity is real is a fundamental question , because the EU will not survive without solidarity , at least not as we know it . 
The sense of equality and solidarity is a necessary foundation of any democratic community . 
In the 1950 &apos;s the British sociologist T. S. Marshall wrote about the progress of rights , from civil rights in the 18 th century , to political ( democratic ) rights in the 19 th century , to social rights in the 20 th century . 
These three dimensions - liberal , democratic and social - describe the modern European nation state . 
Solidarity played the most central role in the 20 th century . 
Indeed , it was the driving force behind the development of the European countries in the wake of World War II , and led to their transformation into &quot; social states &quot; emphasizing social security and a variety of welfare programs . 
We can measure this &quot; institutionalized solidarity &quot; in a nation state by the share of redistribution in its GDP . 
There is also another level of solidarity , which we can call universal or global solidarity . 
Its importance - reflected in various forms of international aid -  has been very limited until now . 
Its objective is not to ensure the equality of citizens &apos; rights , but to guarantee minimum life conditions . 
Humanitarian interventions - much discussed in the 1990 &apos;s - are another manifestation of this global solidarity . 
Between citizen solidarity at the nation-state level and humanitarian solidarity on the global level lies a third level of solidarity which is most interesting for Europeans - the EU level . 
In its early years the European Community was mainly concerned with peace , stability and democracy . 
But institutionalized solidarity has become increasingly important in European consolidation and intra-European redistribution played a key role in the modernization of Ireland , Spain , Portugal , and Greece . 
At the same time , the Zeitgeist has turned against the ideals of solidarity since the 1970 &apos;s . 
Solidarity has lost ground against new demands of individual freedom , and even more against the imperative of economic efficiency , which became ever more pressing as a result of globalization . 
A &quot; revolt of the middle classes &quot; that increasingly refuse to pay for society &apos;s &quot; underdogs &quot; is accompanied by budgetary constraints that can also make solidarity seem a luxury . 
The demands of solidarity are even more difficult to sustain when they require inter-state redistribution . 
A refusal to carry the transfer costs associated with multinational states contributed to the &quot; velvet divorce &quot; between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and the dramatic breakdown of ex-Yugoslavia . 
Similar tensions exist in some West European countries ( Belgium , Spain , Italy ) as well . 
EU enlargement , with the prospect of increased cross-national redistribution , thus exposes particularly thorny issues of European solidarity . 
The promised annual EU payments to the candidate members are far below those made to current members . 
Poland , for example , will get about 67 euros per year per capita during 2004-2006 , Hungary will receive 49 euros , and the Czech Republic will get just 29 euros . 
By contrast , Greece received 437 euros per capita in 2000 , Ireland got 418 euros , and Portugal was paid 211 euros . 
To be sure , Europe , with its sluggish growth , feels less rich than in the past , when the earlier accession deals were negotiated . 
But the difference in treatment of the current candidate countries does not just reflect budgetary problems . 
The changing attitudes of citizens of the more developed member states and the weakening of the sense of obligation entailed by solidarity are also responsible ( probably primarily so ) . 
The sense of solidarity between the candidate countries and current EU members is further weakened by the problem of external security . 
The accession states only recently regained their independence , and so retain a feeling of uncertainty as to their security . 
These jitters contributed to the support they gave to the US position on Iraq , which in turn provoked the irritation of some Western European leaders and the decline of public support in the member states for EU enlargement . 
Yet another potentially important source of fraying European solidarity is the changing architecture of the EU . 
Status differentiation is progressively replacing the model of equal rights and obligations of all member states . 
Ten years ago , Wolfgang Sch√§uble and Karl Lamers suggested the formation of a &quot; core Europe , &quot; a group of countries that would speed up integration among themselves . 
Similar ideas , especially concerning security and foreign policy have proliferated ever since . 
Such a tendency can contribute to a further weakening of solidarity and deepening of intra-European divisions . 
The process of differentiation - inevitable to some extent , given the number and the diversity of member states - is also reinforced by the attitude of the new entrants . 
&quot; Return to Europe &quot; is no longer the battle cry of the new post-communist democracies . 
Public debates now focus on financial support from the EU and the status of individual nation states , rather than European destiny and common European projects . 
There are fears on both sides . 
This is understandable , given the scope of enlargement and the need for an internal transformation of the Union . 
But these fears and the atmosphere of suspicion must be overcome . 
Mutual trust must be reinforced . 
The constitutional debate in the next several months should focus on these major questions : why and how Europe &apos;s peoples want to live together . 
The concept of solidarity should obviously be central to this debate .
