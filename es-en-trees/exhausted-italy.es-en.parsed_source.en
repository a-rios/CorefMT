Exhausted Italy 
Italy is facing perhaps its most important elections since 1948 , when voters confirmed the emergence of Italy &apos;s new republic from the wreckage of Mussolini &apos;s fascist regime . 
On April 9-10 , Italians must choose between Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s center-right government and the center-left bloc headed by Romano Prodi . 
But neither man seems the sort of decisive figure that overcoming Italy &apos;s bleak economic predicament demands . 
Italy &apos;s economic malaise is obvious . 
Cumulative economic growth over the past five years was the slowest in the euro zone - 3.2 % , compared to an average of 7.8 % - with two years of stagnation . 
Per capita GDP , too , has fallen below the euro-zone average . 
Employment has increased , but labor productivity has remained flat and total factor productivity has declined . 
Combined with strong real exchange-rate appreciation , this has led to a dramatic loss of competitiveness and weakening exports . 
Indeed , the only growth sector seems to be books about Italy &apos;s decline . 
Berlusconi claims that statistics are unreliable , for they conceal a much rosier reality for today &apos;s well-off Italians . 
Other members of the government admit more soberly that Italy faces serious problems , but they lay the blame on factors beyond their control : a series of global economic shocks , a slow-down in continental Europe , the admission of China to the World Trade Organization , and the role of the euro . 
But such explanations are unconvincing . 
The global shocks affected all European countries alike , as did the entry of China ( and other Asian countries ) into the WTO , but French exports , for example , suffered much less , while German exports actually increased . 
True , European growth was dragged down by meager growth in Germany , but Italy grew marginally less than Germany . 
Finally , while the euro has put a stop to competitive devaluations , it also provided Italy with a sizeable benefit : a reduction by 6 % of GDP in interest payments on the huge public debt accumulated in the 1990 &quot; s . 
It would be unfair , however , to blame the Berlusconi government alone for this dismal performance . 
Italy &apos;s growth has been slower than Europe &apos;s , with weakening exports , for the past decade , because the country was ill prepared to adjust to the global revolution in information technology and the changing pattern of world trade . 
Its infrastructure , both material and intellectual , was poorer , and its economic structure was unfit for the new challenges , owing both to firm size and their specialization in traditional sectors , as well as low levels of education and R D. 
Yet the Berlusconi government did next to nothing to address these deficiencies , despite being the first government in Italy &apos;s history to survive a full five-year electoral term . 
With an unassailable parliamentary majority , it could have undertaken coherent supply-side reforms , even at the risk of some initial unpopularity . 
A couple of reforms were belatedly enacted : timid intervention on pensions and a further increase in labor-market flexibility . 
But nothing was done to deregulate product markets or to give proper incentives to restructuring , while privatization came to a halt . 
Instead , the government chose old-style Keynesian policy : moderate tax cuts to increase disposable income and an increase in current expenditure . 
Between 2001 and 2005 , current non-interest expenditure rose by 2 % of GDP , revenues fell by 0.5 % of GDP , and the general government deficit rose by 1 % of GDP . 
Worse , the surplus fell from 3.2 % to 0.5 % of GDP , and fell even allowing for the business cycle . 
As a result , the debt-to-GDP ratio declined only modestly until 2004 and rose again - to more than 106 % - in 2005 . 
The weak fiscal position will severely constrain whatever government comes to power . 
The center-left &apos;s ponderous electoral program proposes a cut of five percentage points in payroll taxes , but it is not clear where the required â‚¬ 10 billion will come from to pay for this . 
The idea of increasing the low ( 12.5 % ) withholding tax on capital gains met with accusations that Prodi intends to expropriate wealth . 
But the right &apos;s slim manifesto includes its own unaffordable promises , such as cuts in property taxes and increases in low-level pensions . 
Italian voters are perplexed . 
In 2001 , Berlusconi signed a &quot; contract with the Italians &quot; containing promises that have gone unfulfilled . 
He has always fancied himself as a savior , convinced that he alone can fix the country . 
So he finds it unconceivable that anybody can feel otherwise or even that rules should stand in his way . 
Hence his government &apos;s efforts to pass laws changing judicial procedures , or to consolidate the duopoly of public ( government-controlled ) television stations and his own , or to concoct a bizarre new electoral law favorable to his coalition . 
But voters &quot; frustration with Berlusconi is not necessarily good news for Prodi and the left . 
Opinion polls reveal that trust in all politicians and political parties has reached the lowest level ever . 
Italy has endured a sad and degrading electoral campaign , one that has generated a lot of heat , but little light . 
One hopes that whoever wins buckles down to the serious work that Italy so desperately needs .
