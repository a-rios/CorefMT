The Real Hazard of Globalization 
It is fashionable to blame the International Monetary Fund for the wave of financial turmoil that has swept emerging markets since Mexico &apos;s &quot; Tequila crisis &quot; of 1994 . 
By bailing out countries in trouble time and again , the IMF allegedly encouraged investors to take unwarranted risks , plowing money into countries without properly assessing whether they could ever pay it back . 
According to IMF critics , bailouts allowed leaders from Brazil to Turkey to avoid painful but necessary reforms , with the perverse effect of making crises inevitable . 
This argument - an example of what economists call &quot; moral hazard &quot; - is easy on the mind , but it has feet of clay . 
In fact , foreign investment in emerging markets already started to subside after 1995 , then plummeted with the Asian crisis of 1997 , and has remained low ever since - even as the IMF orchestrated many of the bailouts that allegedly distorted investor behavior in the first place ! 
Moreover , foreign investment in emerging markets shifted after 1994 to factories , real estate , service industries , and so forth . 
Unlike foreign bondholders , who could cut and run after the IMF guaranteed that they would be paid , these direct investors suffered major losses when crisis struck - and thus can hardly be said to have benefited from bailouts . 
Ever since the beginning of the 1990s , when private credit to emerging markets soared to roughly ten times its annual average in 1970-89 , the main source of financial contagion has not been moral hazard , but what might best be called globalization hazard . 
The hazard struck after 1996 , when foreign private investors fled emerging markets even faster than they had flooded them . 
For example , in 1997-98 Thailand suffered an outflow of foreign capital equivalent to 26 % of GDP , despite a solid record of sustained economic growth . 
Why were even relatively well-run economies pulled under so suddenly ? 
The most likely scenario is that investors attributed the steep initial rise in credit flows after 1989 to sound policies in emerging markets . 
Throughout much of the 1990s , the &quot; Washington establishment &quot; reinforced this belief , encouraging an overly optimistic belief in the permanence of large credit flows . 
Ultimately , however , each crisis multiplied the worries of investors about emerging-market risk . 
Worse still , their mood reversal was swift owing to the lack of a long and reliable track record for emerging-market debt . 
This drove up interest rates for emerging-market debt as an asset class . 
As borrowing costs rose in all emerging markets - regardless of their fundamental economic health - so did the probability of recurrent crises , forming a vicious circle . 
If this were the whole story , then what lay at the root of financial contagion in emerging markets would be of secondary importance . 
Whether moral hazard or globalization hazard , more careful credit rationing by investors could be expected to reduce the recurrence of financial crises . 
For while the moral hazard argument emphasizes the orthodox commandment &quot; Thou shall not intervene , &quot; the crucial feature of globalization hazard is market failure . 
Unlike moral hazard , market failure highlights circumstances in which government intervention is both socially desirable and economically defensible . 
That the failure of international capital markets led to sudden and devastating capital outflows after 1996 is only one such episode . 
Consider other devastating events that are uninsured ( and often uninsurable ) in the private sector . 
In the US , for example , floods , hurricanes , earthquakes , and tornadoes trigger immediate Federal assistance . 
Similarly , the cost of the public &apos;s aversion to air travel following the September 11 th terrorist attacks would have been much higher for the economy as a whole if the airline industry had been allowed to collapse . 
Unfortunately , many emerging markets have weak governments that cannot define credible policies for financing intervention in such circumstances . 
A typical case is a country whose terms of trade abruptly deteriorate - for example , Nicaragua after the recent collapse of coffee prices caused by Vietnam &apos;s bumper crop . 
When this happens in a country with few other economic sectors that can compete internationally and so take up the slack , the result is similar to a natural disaster . 
The government , faced with lower budget revenues , is likely to issue new debt , but without being able to specify how it will be repaid . 
So , who will pay the bill eventually ? 
The moment official intervention is required , everyone runs for cover . 
Investment decisions are postponed , implying slower growth and an even more precarious fiscal position . 
In an open economy , fears of higher taxes may spur capital flight and a run against the domestic banks , requiring even bigger government transfers . 
Weak governments grow weaker by the day . 
But even weak governments are not entirely helpless . 
They can lengthen their debt maturities by imposing controls on capital inflows , as Chile and Colombia have done . 
They also can conclude trade agreements with more advanced economies . 
The North American Free Trade Agreement , for example , probably contributed to Mexico &apos;s strong and lasting recovery from the Tequila crisis . 
The Tequila crisis demonstrates that rapid multilateral action - in this case , a $ 50 billion package to refinance short-term debts at below-market rates - can also be effective in preventing the spread of contagion . 
Such packages provide the breathing space that governments need in a crisis in order to launch longer-term reforms . 
This was true of Thailand and South Korea , when both moved fast to strengthen their banking sectors after receiving IMF bailouts . 
IMF assistance is , of course , no universal panacea . 
Emerging markets are inherently fragile markets . 
Precisely for this reason , the problem has been too little multilateral intervention , not too much .
