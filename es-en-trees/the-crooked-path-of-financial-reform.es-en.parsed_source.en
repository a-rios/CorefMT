The Crooked Path of Financial Reform 
BRUSSELS - Two years ago , governments saved the necks of the world &apos;s financial markets . 
Yet today , those same markets intimidate governments , or at least some of them . 
In Europe , the market for Greek debt has frozen , and interest-rate spreads between Irish and German euro-denominated debt recently reached alarming levels . 
Spain has succeeded in reducing its own spread vis-à-vis Germany but only after a policy U-turn . 
Portugal has announced a major austerity package , hoping for the same effect . 
But , even when they are not in danger of losing access to the bond market , most governments in the developed world nowadays anxiously await the pronouncements of the same rating agencies that they were recently vilifying . 
This change of fortune is shocking . 
To public opinion , it looks as if arrogant financial-market professionals learned nothing from the crisis , feeding the impression that nothing has changed - except for the worse . 
Governments with a mandate to domesticate financial markets appear to have produced a lot of sound and fury , but little reform . 
Whether deliberately or not , regulators seem to have missed their chance to implement serious changes to the rules of global finance , and governments are now so weakened that they are at the mercy of those who , not long ago , were begging them for help . 
This politically devastating sentiment fuels resentment against markets and financiers . 
Nevertheless , while no one is proclaiming , &quot; mission accomplished , &quot; it is not true that nothing has been done to reform finance . 
In a recent study from the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel , Stéphane Rottier and Nicolas Véron provide a comprehensive scoreboard of the progress achieved in reforming financial regulation over the last two years , starting from the program agreed in November 2008 at the G-20 meeting in Washington . 
To be sure , they find that implementation has been patchy , with a gap between items whose follow-up was assigned to strong international organizations , such as the International Monetary Fund , and those merely calling for coordination among national authorities . 
Overall , however , the result is far from zero . 
Indeed , the US adopted wide-ranging financial reform in July , Europe is in the final steps of approval of its legislative package , and the Basel committee has just given the green light to a substantial tightening of credit-risk rules . 
The benchmark for this study is admittedly far from ideal . 
The G-20 &quot; s Washington program ( signed by George W. Bush ) was neither ambitious nor well structured . 
It did not aim to domesticate global finance , and it was not based on a thorough analysis of the crisis . 
Under pressure to act without delay , and unable at this early stage to identify key priorities for structural reform , governments set themselves a long and ragbag to-do list . 
There was no sign of the more radical ideas that emerged later in the debate , such as the so-called Volcker rule separating banks and hedge funds ( which is reflected in the US legislation ) , or a crisis-resolution mechanism whereby bank debt is converted semi-automatically into equity ( which several countries are considering ) . 
Nor was there any mention of banks &quot; size and ways to address the too-big-to-fail issue . 
Almost two years on , financial reform remains incomplete , as the agenda itself is still evolving . 
This was inevitable , because new , better-defined priorities could emerge only after a period of reflection and debate . 
The downside is that some momentum has been lost , especially at the G-20 level . 
The appetite for global solutions has diminished while national politics have taken increasing control of the agenda . 
But one positive recent development is the creation of stronger public institutions . 
The era when London vaunted its light-touch regulation is over . 
Now the US and Europe are in the process of building institutions capable of supporting - and implementing - sustained reform . 
Indeed , in pausing to reflect , governments have not missed the political opportunity to be tough , nor have financial markets regained the upper hand . 
True , the balance of power certainly is not what it was two years ago . 
Regulatory capture is at work again , perhaps even more forcefully , because the stakes are higher . 
But it is not self-evident that governments &quot; ability to regulate has been seriously harmed by their status as borrowers . 
While Greece has virtually forfeited its access to capital markets , Germany has never borrowed on better terms . 
And , if governments &quot; dependence on bond markets &quot; willingness to lend has not rendered them unable to reform financial regulation , this is all the more true for the EU and the G-20 . 
Just as we have learned to distinguish between governments as shareholders and as regulators - which must be done carefully , because the actions of one do not necessarily coincide with the interests of the other - today we must distinguish between governments as borrowers and as financial regulators . 
It would be unfortunate if governments requiring financial institutions to be more prudent in managing risk were at the same time asked to turn a blind eye to sovereign risk . 
Even if this sounds unfair , it is logical to expect rating agencies , which had been lax in evaluating credit risk , now to be rigorous in assessing all forms of risk , including sovereign risk . 
The history books are not yet written , nor the victor declared . 
Financial reform could still go belly up . 
But it is premature to write it off as a failure .
