Bankruptcy Comes to China 
BEIJING - China &apos;s businessmen have always needed resilience , but now they must become accustomed to the specter of bankruptcy . 
For China now has a bankruptcy code with teeth , and the country &apos;s courts are beginning to enforce it with rigor . 
Bankruptcy legislation in China started right after Deng Xiaoping launched his pro-market reforms three decades ago . 
The Law on Enterprise Bankruptcy ( Trial Implementation ) , the first of its kind , was enacted in 1986 . 
Its execution , however , was crippled by its very narrow scope for application , the absence of corresponding laws governing corporate restructuring , excessive government intervention , incompatibility with the policy-based bankruptcy procedure then in place , technical errors , and a general inability to make the code operational . 
So , in 2006 , a revised version of the law was enacted , marking an important milestone in China &apos;s efforts to build an effective legal system as it moves towards a market economy . 
Compared with the original bankruptcy code , the 2006 code is firmly rooted in the needs of a market economy . 
First , it aims to ensure that obligations are fairly and regularly met when a debtor becomes financially insolvent . 
Thus , it seeks to protect the lawful rights of both creditors and debtors . 
The legislation also imposed a deadline to abolish &quot; policy-based bankruptcy &quot; - the practice adopted by the State Council to liquidate loss-making state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) and resettle laid-off employees . 
Unlike the Bankruptcy Law , the administrative procedure has a different hierarchy of liquidation priorities : what a bankrupt SOE owes to its employees and the resettlement charges must be covered first and foremost by its total assets , including the enterprise &apos;s collateral , in order to reduce dependence on local governmental budgets . 
Yet this process leaves the rights of creditors undefended , eliciting widespread criticism . 
The new Enterprise Bankruptcy Law redefines its scope of application to preclude overlap with other laws like the Social Security Law and the Labor Law . Indeed , resettlement of laid-off SOE employees , and other social implications of layoffs , should now be addressed primarily by government through the social safety net , rather than as part of the bankruptcy process . 
The new code also introduces the concept of &quot; administrative receivership , &quot; whereby lawyers , certified accountants , and other intermediaries act as managers of enterprises undergoing bankruptcy . 
The procedure abolishes the Liquidation Team , a long-standing regime that many alleged was unjust , aggressive in administrative intervention , unprofessional , and unaccountable . 
In order for this part of the law to go ahead , the Supreme People &apos;s Court issued judicial interpretations that set out who can be designated a company receiver and the amount and type of compensation they can be paid . 
Up to now , some 2,520 agencies and 388 individuals have been included on the list of receivers . 
Yet problems remain . 
For example , receivers are paid unreasonably poorly in cases of limited assets ; furthermore , the random , indiscriminate appointment of receivers sometimes leaves cases over- or understaffed . 
Consequently , the job of receiver , though it carries strict liabilities , is highly risky in terms of reward . 
If no viable solution is found , no agency or individual will be willing to serve as the receiver in ordinary bankruptcy cases . 
Another important innovation is the adoption of restructuring procedures based on other countries &quot; experiences . 
The possibility of restructuring balances the interests of stakeholders and uses legal protections to help potentially risky enterprises prevent or avoid bankruptcy if a bailout is worthwhile or possible . 
But stricter and more reasonable standards should be established for courts &quot; approval of restructuring plans . 
For example , if the required majority of shareholders adopts such a plan , the court should protect the rights of the minority of creditors who may have opposed it . 
And if the liquidation rate for creditors &quot; common claims is defined as no lower than that at the time the draft restructuring plan was submitted for approval , compensation must be considered in the event that payment is delayed . 
Moreover , the Bankruptcy Law , the Company Law , and the Securities Law should be well coordinated and mutually reinforcing . 
How can an enterprise being restructured , say , find a way to issue securities for financing if it cannot meet conventional standards such as profitability and net asset value , as required by the Company Law and the Securities Law ? 
The law must contain specific provisions regarding such matters in order to ensure successful listing of restructuring firms . 
To prevent fraud , an acute problem in the past , the new law established a &quot; right of rescission , &quot; whereby the receiver can ask courts to rescind any action by a debtor that involves fraud , evasion , or unfair liquidation in the prescribed period before a bankruptcy petition is accepted and assets recovered . 
The system now holds the key to fairness liquidation . 
Moreover , the Criminal Law of the People &apos;s Republic of China now includes bankruptcy fraud . 
The successful implementation of China &apos;s revised Bankruptcy Law hinges on its effective enforcement and abandonment of the mindset and practices shaped under the old version , especially in the era of policy-based bankruptcy . 
Despite the difficulties that remain , China &apos;s bankruptcy legislation is increasingly adapted to the market economy ; the trend is irreversible .
