A Long March with China 
BEIJING - US Vice President Joe Biden &apos;s recent four-day visit to China ended on a high note . 
He assured Chinese leaders that the United States is committed to honoring all its debts , despite its recent credit downgrade ; he talked enthusiastically about US-China interdependence ; and he showcased his granddaughter , who has studied Chinese for several years , as a future bridge between the two countries . 
But , behind all the smiles and banquet toasts , serious issues and perception gaps continue to divide the world &apos;s two great powers . 
For starters , there is always an attitude problem . 
To those who view China &apos;s rise in a negative light , the country is simply becoming ever more arrogant . 
It is getting tough in its territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea ; it is becoming assertive in the South China Sea with its neighbors , also over disputed islands ; it put its own stealth fighter on display during the US defense secretary &apos;s visit to China ; it is sending its first aircraft carrier out to sea for trials , indicating the possibility of establishing naval bases in the Indian Ocean . 
Even a brawl between the Chinese and a visiting American basketball team is viewed as evidence of China &apos;s aggressive behavior . 
Many Chinese , on the other hand , tend to think that the US is suffering from severe case of conceited superpower syndrome . 
As these Chinese see it , the US has a rather dysfunctional government , but nevertheless insists that its political and economic system is the best in the world , and that everyone should emulate it . 
It is heavily in debt , but cannot stop spending and borrowing . 
It is no longer competitive in manufacturing , but blames others for its huge trade deficit . 
And the world &apos;s only military superpower is often seen within China as trigger-happy when intervening in other countries &quot; internal affairs . 
Then , there is the issue of trust . 
China &apos;s critics argue that its claims to a peaceful rise are not credible , given the country &apos;s non-democratic , one-party system . 
Coupled with this is a zero-sum view of the world , in which any Chinese gain in the share of the global economy , or any increased presence in many parts of the world , must be at the expense of the US or other powers . 
Any Chinese military move is portrayed as an expansionary and aggressive act that must be contained . 
Any attempts at engagement by Western politicians , such as Biden &apos;s recent trip , are automatically met with doubt and criticism for cozying up to dictators . 
Likewise , for those Chinese who are suspicious of US intentions , conspiracy is always in play . 
They see a declining superpower using economic , military , and diplomatic means in an unrelenting effort to prevent China &apos;s rise . 
Talk of human rights and democracy is nothing but a smoke screen for demonizing China . 
Arms sales to Taiwan , Tibetan activism , and &quot; color revolutions &quot; of various kinds are all sponsored by the US and other Western powers , and are aimed at weakening China . 
Despite decades of close interaction , with millions of Americans , Europeans , and Japanese visiting China every year and similar numbers of Chinese now visiting the US and other advanced countries , both sides see each other through a glass darkly . 
Increased interdependence has not led to better understandings on even some of the most basic issues . 
China &apos;s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Fu Ying expressed her country &apos;s anxiety about this state of affairs in a recent interview . 
&quot; The most important thing is the question of whether China and the US are enemies . 
Are we going to be in a war ? 
Are we preparing for a war against each other ? &quot; 
Biden , while reaffirming that the US does not view China as an enemy , implied that Fu &apos;s worries are not fanciful , saying that the worst scenario is a misunderstanding that leads to an unintended conflict . 
So the key issue for China , its neighbors , the US , and rest of the world is not how many aircraft carriers , missiles , submarines , and next-generation fighters China may produce and deploy in the coming years and decades . 
Rather , it is how China intends to use its newly acquired economic and military strength in pursuing its domestic and foreign-policy goals - and how the world &apos;s leading powers can ensure that they do not end up harming each other by accident or misunderstanding . 
To meet these challenges successfully , there is no viable alternative to a positive , continuous , and frank engagement between China and the rest of the world . 
The Chinese economy will continue to grow ; the Chinese military will continue to modernize ; and the Chinese people will remain united in their Great Power aspirations . 
A Cold War-style confrontation and containment policy from the West will be met with strong resistance from the Chinese , whose global leverage , particularly in finance , cannot be ignored . 
Only a patient , creative , and consistent engagement strategy will mitigate fears on both sides . 
China &apos;s rise is a fact ; the enduring peacefulness of that rise must be a priority for China , its neighbors , the West , and , most importantly , the US .
