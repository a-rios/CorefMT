Shinzo Abe &apos;s Monetary-Policy Delusions 
NEW HAVEN - The politicization of central banking continues unabated . 
The resurrection of Shinzo Abe and Japan &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party - pillars of the political system that has left the Japanese economy mired in two lost decades and counting - is just the latest case in point . 
Japan &apos;s recent election hinged critically on Abe &apos;s views of the Bank of Japan &apos;s monetary policy stance . 
He argued that a timid BOJ should learn from its more aggressive counterparts , the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank . 
Just as the Fed and the ECB have apparently saved the day through their unconventional and aggressive quantitative easing ( QE ) , goes the argument , Abe believes it is now time for the BOJ to do the same . 
It certainly looks as if he will get his way . 
With BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa &apos;s term ending in April , Abe will be able to select a successor - and two deputy governors as well - to do his bidding . 
But will it work ? 
While experimental monetary policy is now widely accepted as standard operating procedure in today &apos;s post-crisis era , its efficacy is dubious . 
Nearly four years after the world hit bottom in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , QE &apos;s impact has been strikingly asymmetric . 
While massive liquidity injections were effective in unfreezing credit markets and arrested the worst of the crisis - witness the role of the Fed &apos;s first round of QE in 2009-2010 - subsequent efforts have not sparked anything close to a normal cyclical recovery . 
The reason is not hard to fathom . 
Hobbled by severe damage to private and public-sector balance sheets , and with policy interest rates at or near zero , post-bubble economies have been mired in a classic &quot; liquidity trap . &quot; 
They are more focused on paying down massive debt overhangs built up before the crisis than on assuming new debt and boosting aggregate demand . 
The sad case of the American consumer is a classic example of how this plays out . 
In the years leading up to the crisis , two bubbles - property and credit - fueled a record-high personal-consumption binge . 
When the bubbles burst , households understandably became fixated on balance-sheet repair - namely , paying down debt and rebuilding personal savings , rather than resuming excessive spending habits . 
Indeed , notwithstanding an unprecedented post-crisis tripling of Fed assets to roughly $ 3 trillion - probably on their way to $ 4 trillion over the next year - US consumers have pulled back as never before . 
In the 19 quarters since the start of 2008 , annualized growth of inflation-adjusted consumer spending has averaged just 0.7 % - almost three percentage points below the 3.6 % trend increases recorded in the 11 years ending in 2006 . 
Nor does the ECB have reason to be gratified with its strain of quantitative easing . 
Despite a doubling of its balance sheet , to a little more than € 3 trillion ( $ 4 trillion ) , Europe has slipped back into recession for the second time in four years . 
Not only is QE &apos;s ability to jumpstart crisis-torn , balance-sheet-constrained economies limited ; it also runs the important risk of blurring the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy . 
Central banks that buy sovereign debt issued by fiscal authorities offset market-imposed discipline on borrowing costs , effectively subsidizing public-sector profligacy . 
Unfortunately , it appears that Japan has forgotten many of its own lessons - especially the BOJ &apos;s disappointing experience with zero interest rates and QE in the early 2000 &quot; s . 
Zombie-like companies were kept on artificial life-support in the false hope that time alone would revive them . 
It was not until late in the decade , when the banking sector was reorganized and corporate restructuring was encouraged , that Japan made progress on the long , arduous road of balance-sheet repair and structural transformation . 
US authorities have succumbed to the same Japanese-like temptations . 
From quantitative easing to record-high federal budget deficits to unprecedented bailouts , they have done everything in their power to mask the pain of balance-sheet repair and structural adjustment . 
As a result , America has created its own generation of zombies - in this case , zombie consumers . 
Like Japan , America &apos;s post-bubble healing has been limited - even in the face of the Fed &apos;s outsize liquidity injections . 
Household debt stood at 112 % of income in the third quarter of 2012 - down from record highs in 2006 , but still nearly 40 percentage points above the 75 % norm of the last three decades of the twentieth century . 
Similarly , the personal-saving rate , at just 3.5 % in the four months ending in November 2012 , was less than half the 7.9 % average of 1970-99 . 
The same is true of Europe . 
The ECB &apos;s über-aggressive actions have achieved little in the way of bringing about long-awaited structural transformation in the region . 
Crisis-torn peripheral European economies still suffer from unsustainable debt loads and serious productivity and competitiveness problems . 
And a fragmented European banking system remains one of the weakest links in the regional daisy chain . 
Is this the &quot; cure &quot; that Abe really wants for Japan ? 
The last thing that the Japanese economy needs at this point is backsliding on structural reforms . 
Yet , by forcing the BOJ to follow in the misdirected footsteps of the Fed and the ECB , that is precisely the risk that Abe and Japan are facing . 
Massive liquidity injections carried out by the world &apos;s major central banks - the Fed , the ECB , and the BOJ - are neither achieving traction in their respective real economies , nor facilitating balance-sheet repair and structural change . 
That leaves a huge sum of excess liquidity sloshing around in global asset markets . 
Where it goes , the next crisis is inevitably doomed to follow .
