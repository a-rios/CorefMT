Iran &apos;s Troubled Rise 
America &apos;s decision to target Iranian agents in Iraq who may be involved in supporting violent militias is but another sign of the massive influence Iran is exercising in that troubled country . 
But the United States in fact facilitated Iran &apos;s growing influence by toppling Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime and that of the Taliban in Afghanistan , thus removing two factors that had kept the Iranian regime hemmed in for the last two decades . 
Moreover , high oil prices have filled the national treasury , and Iran is benefiting from the opportunity created by America &apos;s being bogged down in Iraq and the growing international weight of Russia and China . 
Iran is also reaping the returns of long-term investments . 
It has supported Iraqi Shiite groups since the early 1980 &quot; s and has an equally long-standing alliance with Syria . 
In Lebanon , Iran helped create Hezbollah , which recently survived a head-on war with Israel and is the leading opponent of the anti-Syrian , Western-backed government . 
Iran &apos;s investment in Palestine is more recent , but its backing for the Hamas-led government , which has been frustrated elsewhere , is no less significant . 
A country of 70 million , Iran also has potential influence with Shiite communities in Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , and the UAE . 
Iran &apos;s rise is causing alarm in the Arab Middle East , particularly in Saudi Arabia and Jordan , but also in Egypt . 
Though a Shiite country in an overwhelmingly Sunni region , Iran &apos;s radical Islamism resonates with the politicized Islamism that is energizing most Arab opposition movements , and its militant opposition to the US and support for groups that engage Israel in battle is very popular on the Arab street and in the Arab media . 
At another level , Iran &apos;s rise , reinforced by its suspected bid for nuclear weapons threatens to awaken historical hostilities , between Sunnis and Shiites and between Persians and Arabs . 
Both Iran and the Arab countries are struggling to come to terms with the consequences of Iran &apos;s newfound assertiveness . 
To be sure , Iran &apos;s longstanding support for regional Shiite groups is paying off . 
But its successes in Iraq , Lebanon , and Palestine are creating great anxiety , and even hostility , in some quarters . 
The rapid Shiite rise has already turned into a sectarian civil war in Iraq and recently has threatened to generate the same outcome in Lebanon . 
If Iran does not properly manage its growing power , it could unwittingly trigger a drawn out sectarian war throughout the region , a nuclear arms race with Saudi Arabia and Egypt , and war with Israel , the US , or both . 
It could also draw in major Sunni powers , such as Egypt and Turkey , which have at times been dominant in the region , but lately have been disengaged . 
Too many Iranian successes , and too many Sunni debacles , could also lead to immense pressure in Syria , where a minority Alawi regime dominates a Sunni majority . 
The loss of Damascus would cost Iran its influence in Syria , Lebanon , and Palestine in one fell swoop . 
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad &apos;s administration is maintaining its radical rhetoric , perhaps looking ahead to a post-Bush era , when the US has withdrawn from Iraq and Iran has developed nuclear weapons . 
Nevertheless , Iran also feels the need for accommodation with its adversaries . 
For example , while Iran may not be happy with the American presence in Iraq , it realizes how close the country is to full-scale civil war . 
As a result , it has expressed a willingness to cooperate with the US on finding a soft landing for Iraq . 
Likewise , while Iran supports Hezbollah , it has also held Hezbollah back from outright rebellion , which might trigger a further Sunni backlash in the region . 
In the Gulf , Iran has tried to reassure its Arab neighbors that Iranian power is not aimed at them and can in fact be a pillar of gulf security . 
But the Arab world is divided about how to deal with the sudden rise in Iranian power . 
The tension is particularly acute in Saudi Arabia , which has warned the US about the dangers of Iraq &apos;s possible collapse and now finds itself in an unequal face-off with Iran . 
Some in the kingdom argue that Saudi Arabia must confront Iran , stand up for Sunni Arab interests , and become a hands-on regional power . 
Other Saudis believe that confrontation will only lead to wider wars and are urging dialogue and accommodation . 
In this view , the US , not Iran , produced the region &apos;s current problems . 
Iran &apos;s regional foreign policy has not yet caught up with its new pre-eminence ; it is making as many enemies as it is gaining friends , and it might squander the windfall gains that it made in the past three years . 
If Iran and the Arab countries - and alongside them the US and the international community - do not manage today &apos;s tensions wisely , the region could enter a period of protracted warfare . 
But there is a way forward , because all players in the region share an interest in security and stability . 
Leaders in Tehran , Riyadh , Washington , and other key capitals must realize the costs of further mismanagement , step back from the brink , and work toward cooperative solutions before it is too late .
