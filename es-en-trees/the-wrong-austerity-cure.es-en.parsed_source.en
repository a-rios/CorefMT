The Wrong Austerity Cure 
BERKELEY - Fiscal profligacy did not cause the sovereign-debt crisis engulfing Europe , and fiscal austerity will not solve it . 
On the contrary , such austerity has aggravated the crisis and now threatens to bring down the euro and throw the global economy into another tailspin . 
In 2007 , Spain and Ireland were models of fiscal rectitude , with far lower debt-to-GDP ratios than Germany had . 
Investors were not worried about default risk on Spanish or Irish sovereign debt , or about Italy &apos;s chronically large sovereign debt . 
Indeed , Italy boasted the lowest deficit-to-GDP ratio in the eurozone , and the Italian government had no problem refinancing at attractive interest rates . 
Even Greece , despite its rapidly eroding competitiveness and increasingly unsustainable fiscal path , could attract the capital that it needed . 
Deluded by the convergence of bond yields that followed the euro &apos;s launch , investors fed a decade-long private-sector credit boom in Europe &apos;s less-developed periphery countries , and failed to recognize real-estate bubbles in Spain and Ireland , and Greece &apos;s slide into insolvency . 
When growth slowed sharply and credit flows collapsed in the wake of the Great Recession , budget revenues plummeted , governments were forced to socialize private-sector liabilities , and fiscal deficits and debt soared . 
With the exception of Greece , the deterioration in public finances was a symptom of the crisis , not its cause . 
Moreover , the deterioration was predictable : history shows that the real stock of government debt explodes in the wake of recessions caused by financial crises . 
Overlooking the evidence , European leaders , spearheaded by Germany , misdiagnosed the problem as one of fiscal profligacy for which painful austerity is the only cure . 
On this view , significant and rapid reductions in government deficits and debt are a precondition to restoring government credibility and investor confidence , stemming contagion , bringing down interest rates , and reviving economic growth . 
There is also a moral-hazard aspect to the austerity argument : easing repayment terms for spendthrift governments will only encourage reckless behavior in the future - forgiving past sins perpetuates sinning . 
Moreover , virtuous creditors should not bail out irresponsible borrowers , be they private or public . 
From this perspective , austerity is the necessary and just penance for reprobates like Greece , Spain , and Italy . 
But austerity is not working ; indeed , it is counterproductive . 
In the short to medium run , fiscal consolidation - whether in the form of cutting government spending or increasing revenues - results in lower output and employment , which means lower tax collection , higher deficits , and escalating debt relative to GDP . 
Savvy investors , like frustrated voters , recognize that low growth and high unemployment actually enlarge deficits and add to debt in the short run . 
That is why , after more than two years , interest rates are rising , not falling , in countries crushed by onerous austerity measures . 
In fact , there is no simple relationship between the size of a government &apos;s deficit or debt and the interest rate that it must pay . 
British government bonds now offer significantly lower interest rates than those of France , Italy , or Spain , even though the United Kingdom &apos;s fiscal position is considerably worse . 
Greece is caught in a classic debt trap , as the interest rate on its public debt has soared beyond its growth rate by a considerable margin ; 
Austerity in Europe has confirmed the International Monetary Fund &apos;s warning that overdoing fiscal consolidation weakens economic activity , undermines market confidence , and diminishes popular support for adjustment . 
In the long run , many eurozone countries , including Germany , require fiscal consolidation in order to stabilize and reduce their debt-to-GDP ratios . 
But the process should be gradual and back-loaded - with much of the consolidation coming after Europe &apos;s economies have returned to a sustainable growth path . 
Structural reforms are also necessary in most European economies to bolster competitiveness and boost potential growth . 
But such reforms take time : German Chancellor Angela Merkel appears to have forgotten that it took more than a decade and roughly € 2 trillion ( $ 2.5 trillion ) in subsidies for structural reforms to make the former East Germany competitive with the rest of the country . 
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and French President François Hollande are right : Europe needs bold , coordinated policies to promote growth , along with market-based structural reforms to foster competition and an easing of fiscal targets until output and employment recover . 
But how can significant new growth initiatives be financed ? 
The reality is that the rest of Europe cannot succeed in restoring growth without Germany , and Germany remains wedded to the austerity cure . 
With a modest fiscal deficit , record-low borrowing costs , and a huge current-account surplus , Germany has the financial firepower to unleash a significant stimulus . 
But Germany sees no need to stimulate its own economy , and is willing to consider only modest eurozone measures , such as additional capital for the European Investment Bank , a small pilot program for European Union &quot; project bonds &quot; for infrastructure investment , and more rapid deployment of unspent EU structural funds . 
Germany refuses even to allow spending on high-priority infrastructure projects to be exempted from the unrealistic deficit targets set by the EU &apos;s new &quot; fiscal compact . &quot; 
Despite pleas from the IMF and the OECD , Germany also remains implacably opposed to Eurobonds , which could ease the funding constraints of other eurozone members and bolster the resources of the European Stability Mechanism , which currently does not provide a credible firewall against a run on Spanish or Italian sovereign debt - or on the European banks that hold it . 
Indeed , the worsening banking crisis , with deposits fleeing from the eurozone periphery , is further strangling Europe &apos;s growth prospects . 
It is probably too late to save Greece . 
But a shift toward policies to promote growth , supported by the easing of deficit targets and the issuance of Eurobonds , is essential to bring Europe back from the brink of sustained recession , to stabilize Europe &apos;s financial markets , and to prevent another significant disruption to global capital markets .
