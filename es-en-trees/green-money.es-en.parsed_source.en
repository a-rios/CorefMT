Green Money 
NEW YORK - There is little doubt that green will be the metaphorical color of choice for world leaders when they gather at the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh . 
Attention will focus on turning the &quot; green shoots &quot; of recovery into sustainable &quot; green growth , &quot; leading to &quot; green economies &quot; consistent with the goal of protecting the world &apos;s climate . 
Governments in rich countries are beginning to spell out just what that will mean in terms of policy and lifestyle changes and the investments required to develop clean energy sources . 
But , to be successful , a &quot; green new deal &quot; will have to address some enormous challenges in the developing world , where the impact of global warming will be felt first and hardest , and where rapid growth requires massive expansion of cheap energy . 
Globally , more than 30 million tons of oil equivalent are consumed in the form of primary energy every day , equivalent to 55 kilowatt hours per person per day , with rich countries , on average , consuming more than twice that figure . 
For many developing countries , the figure is well under 20 kwh ; 
China is still well below the global average , and even most emerging markets consume less than one-third of the average in many advanced economies . 
The economics behind efforts to close these energy gaps are relatively straightforward . 
Up to a threshold of around 100 kwh per capita per day , energy consumption and human development indicators go hand in hand . 
At current prices , between $ 10 and $ 20 per person per day would be needed to reach that threshold . 
This puts energy security well beyond the means of not just the poorest , but also of most people in emerging economies . 
Spending $ 10 per day on energy services would , for example , exhaust the per capita incomes of countries such as Angola , Ecuador , and Macedonia . 
Hence , big investments in energy services are the order of the day throughout the developing world . 
In order to provide more energy to meet development goals without accelerating global warming , there must be a shift to a new energy infrastructure built around renewables ( of which the most significant are probably solar power , wind , and biofuels ) , cleaner coal , and carbon capture and storage . 
The problem is that these are currently much more costly options than their carbon-heavy alternatives . 
Policy makers in developing countries are concerned that being forced to go down this path could put modern energy services beyond the reach of poor countries , families , and communities . 
Market-based solutions to the climate challenge run the very serious risk of undermining development objectives , precisely because they aim to raise the price of energy services in order to make renewable energy sources attractive to private investors . 
Indeed , the protectionist elements tacked on to these proposals make them decidedly anti-development . 
So what is needed is massive public investment in cleaner energy provision , coupled in the short term with appropriate subsidies to offset high initial prices . 
If targeted at the most promising technology options ( say , solar and wind ) , such a strategy would yield early unit cost write-downs through innovation , learning , and economies of scale ; give the private sector clear , credible , and attractive signals ; and encourage energy efficiency . 
The big obstacle is access to predictable and affordable finance . 
The onus is on rich-country governments to support this big push into clean energy in the developing world , as it was their carbon-fueled economic prosperity that has brought us to the brink of a climate catastrophe . 
So far , rich countries have not risen to the challenge ; despite commitments made at Kyoto , Bali , and elsewhere , the resources committed for climate-change mitigation - let alone adaptation - in developing countries have been paltry and poorly targeted . 
The scale of the needed support is comparable to the Marshall Plan , which committed 1 % of the United States &quot; GDP per year to help European reconstruction after World War II . 
But , as with the original plan , the long-term returns from such a commitment will be enormous . 
This time , moreover , the burden will not fall on one country alone , and a broader mix of traditional and innovative sources of financing are already available to help fund the required investment programs in energy efficiency and renewables . 
Even so , scaling-up multilateral support will require a massive overhaul of international finance . 
Back in April , G-20 leaders accepted that investing in a low-carbon infrastructure , particularly energy services , is key to a truly sustainable economic and environmental future . 
In Pittsburgh , with the clock ticking on talks to adopt a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol this December in Copenhagen , the G-20 will have a real opportunity to show that the color of serious money to meet both climate and development goals really is green .
