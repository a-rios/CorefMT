The Elusive Legacy of 1968 
&quot; Dany , you have been so successful . 
But don &apos;t let yourself be manipulated by those far-left forces that would lead you to destroy everything that could arise from what you are creating . &quot; 
Forty years later , those words on March 22 , 1968 , by Jean Baudrillard - then an assistant professor at Nanterre University - still sound right . 
I may disappoint my supporters and those enticed by &quot; The Revolution , &quot; but I &apos;m not the leader of a revolution that allegedly occurred in 1968 . 
Forget it : &quot; &quot; 68 &quot; is over - buried under cobblestones , even if those cobblestones made history and triggered radical change in our societies ! 
At first it seems baffling . 
Thus , &quot; &quot; 68 &quot; symbolized the end of revolutionary myths - to the benefit of liberation movements extending from the 1970 &quot; s until now . 
After all , the world of the 1960 &quot; s - the first global movement broadcast live on radio and TV - was defined by a variety of inter-connected revolts . 
The change wrought by &quot; &quot; 68 &quot; affected , above all , traditional culture , hidebound moralism , and the principle of hierarchical authority . 
It altered social life , ways of being , ways of talking , ways of loving , and so on . 
But , despite its scope , the movement steered clear of violence in order to create a new mode of rebellion . 
Students , workers , and families - all had their legitimate demands , and all nonetheless converged on the same desire for emancipation . 
The revolt was a form of political expression , but its aim was not to seize political power as such . 
Indeed , its existential essence rendered it &quot; politically untranslatable . &quot; 
The desire for freedom that carried the movement forward necessarily eluded archaic modes of thinking . 
As a result , the sterile categories of political tradition could gain no purchase on events . 
In France , conservatism was so entrenched on both the left and the right that both missed the movement &apos;s meaning and could only fall back on stereotyped revolutionary interpretations . 
As for the anarchists , their utopia of widespread self-management - tied to outdated historical references - appeared entirely unsuitable . 
Starting from an initial rejection of political institutions and parliamentarism , we understood only later that the democratic challenge lies in occupying a politically &quot; normalized &quot; space . 
Faced with the anarchists , with their confining minimalist political grammar - reflected in the famous slogan elections , piege Ã  cons ( &quot; elections , a trap for idiots &quot; ) - and with the Communist Party , whose revolutionary ideal was eventually linked to totalitarian types of society , the future of May 1968 could only shift to the right with the election victory of General de Gaulle . 
It was , undeniably , a political failure . 
But just as undeniable was the huge tremor that shook our antediluvian conceptions of society , morals , and the state . 
Challenging authoritarianism , the revolt triggered an explosion at the heart of the typically French two-headed power structure , which combined a dominant Gaullism and a Communist Party managing the working class . 
Thus , the radicalism of the upheaval eventually liberated the pleasure to live . 
With a new generation emerges a new political imagination and poetic mottos written on walls . 
The surrealist essence of the rebellion was somehow symbolized by Gilles Caron &apos;s famous photograph , in which an insolent smile at a riot policeman subverts the frozen , established order to the point of making it ridiculous . 
Of course , some people have never overcome the end of the ecstasy of those five weeks of craziness and joy , while others still wait for &quot; &quot; 68 &quot; to culminate in God only knows what kind of &quot; D-Day . &quot; 
For my part , I accepted the &quot; principle of reality &quot; long ago , without nostalgia - and without minimizing the importance of what happened . 
For &quot; &quot; 68 &quot; was , indeed , a rebellion joining two eras . 
From the cultural point of view , we won . 
So , revisit &quot; &quot; 68 &quot; ? 
Yes , but only in order to understand it , grasp its scope , and retain what still makes sense today . 
Knowing , for example , that 23 years after World War II , a multicolored France demonstrated against my deportation by claiming &quot; We are all German Jews &quot; provides food for thought . 
But this does not justify the hasty comparison - and even less the identification - of every protest today with &quot; &quot; 68 . &quot; 
After 40 years , the context has changed radically . 
The world of the Cold War is gone , as are schools and factories organized like barracks , authoritarian trade unions , gay bashing , and women &apos;s obligation to receive permission from their husbands before being able to work or open a bank account . 
That world has been replaced by a multilateral world , which includes AIDS , unemployment , energy and climate crises , and so on . 
So let &apos;s permit new generations to define their own battles and desires . 
Demystifying &quot; &quot; 68 &quot; also exposes the pretense of those who would blame it for all the wrongs of today &apos;s world . 
Because the &quot; &quot; 68 generation &quot; wrote on the walls &quot; It is forbidden to forbid , &quot; some hold it responsible for urban violence , extreme individualism , the crisis in education , executives &quot; &quot; golden parachutes , &quot; the decline of authority , and - why not ? - climate change . 
In this way , such people hope that they can evade their duty to explain today &apos;s problems . 
But how can one not interpret this as a political trick aimed at sabotaging the modernization of expression , thereby closing off any space for rational debate ?
