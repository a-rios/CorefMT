The Failed State of Egypt ? 
CAIRO - The aggrieved supporters of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and the jubilant protesters who pushed the military to remove him have divided Egypt into two irreconcilable camps , both reflecting and reinforcing the country &apos;s deeper problems . 
Indeed , Egypt is now largely an ungovernable country that subsists on generous foreign handouts . 
Morsi never appreciated his tenuous position . 
Though elected democratically , he chose to govern undemocratically . 
He was bent on purging the judiciary and the public prosecutor &apos;s office , claiming that they were aligned with the protesters opposing his government and their military backers , who had been overthrown in 2011 . 
Morsi brooked little opposition in pushing through a controversial draft constitution . 
In doing so , he neglected to focus on the structural problems that propelled a docile society to pour into the streets two and a half years ago to bring down his predecessor , Hosni Mubarak . 
Just as damaging as Morsi &apos;s governing style was the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s go-it-alone mentality . 
Decades of persecution have instilled in its leaders the belief that the world is aligned against them . 
Assuming power only stoked their paranoia . 
The Brotherhood &apos;s leaders believed that the United States and Egypt &apos;s elite were bent on ensuring their failure . 
For this reason , they refused to reach out to their secular opponents to offer them a piece of the political pie . 
Even members of the more puritanical Islamist Nour Party were not invited to join the government . 
But it was not only Brotherhood politicians - inexperienced in the ways of democracy ( and skeptical of them ) - who stumbled . 
The debate in the US , long Egypt &apos;s primary ally and donor , did not center on strengthening Egypt &apos;s embattled institutions , but focused instead on how to ease the military out of power by withholding aid . 
Multilateral lenders like the International Monetary Fund were fixated on fiscal reforms such as reducing costly subsidies rather than shoring up a beleaguered economy . 
Today , a democratic transition that the West sought to portray as a model that other Arab nations could emulate lies in tatters . 
Egypt &apos;s economy , bruised by the outflow of foreign investment and a dearth of tourists , is on life support . 
Rebuilding the country will require much more than the cheering from the sidelines that Western countries have offered so far . 
Egypt has always relied on munificent benefactors to sustain its patchy state and economy . 
After the military coup in 1952 , the Soviets provided much of the needed aid . 
Their &quot; technical &quot; experts turned the country &apos;s second city , Alexandria , into a Russian country club . 
After Egypt pivoted to the West in the wake of the 1973 war against Israel , America became its main patron . 
But America &apos;s ritual annual gift of roughly $ 1.5 billion could only dull the pain of Egypt &apos;s problems , not resolve them . 
The country can no longer provide enough government stipends in the form of bureaucratic posts for college graduates . 
Egypt can only hope for cash infusions to offset its internal hemorrhaging . 
By making aid conditional on economic reform and democratic transition , however , the international community risks political triage . 
It should instead focus on financial assistance that blunts Egyptians &quot; frustrations and that contributes to building the institutions that will facilitate the transition toward democracy . 
But , of the $ 1.56 billion that the US State Department requested for Egypt in 2013 , only $ 250 million is earmarked for non-military programs . 
The US should increase funding for projects that focus on governance , civil society , and strengthening the rule of law . 
Such programs receive a paltry $ 25 million in the 2013 budget . 
To bolster the economy , the US needs to shift its aid policies away from funding projects toward providing immediate budgetary relief . 
Though financing water-efficiency schemes certainly helps society , its effects are felt years after the aid is initially dispensed . 
The US , and other Western donors , should instead help Egypt to husband its resources , which are often misspent in an effort to placate its people . 
Egypt is the largest wheat importer in the world , and food subsidies account for approximately 2 % of GDP . 
To preserve its precious foreign-currency reserves , Egypt needs the US and its allies to provide foodstuffs . 
Such a policy was adopted in the aftermath of the 1973 war , when America offered $ 200 million annually for wheat procurement . 
Embracing such policies will give institutions and the democratic process the time and space they need to plant firm roots . 
Beyond such questions lies the fate of democracy in one of civilization &apos;s most ancient lands . 
Whoever triumphs in future elections will lack the legitimacy that only a majority can provide . 
Such a majority spoke last year , when it elected Morsi . 
To strip him of his post negates a basic pillar of democracy and sets a dangerous precedent . 
But , in a country that faces so many problems , the paradox of Morsi &apos;s removal from power and the dilemmas of democracy that occasioned it are not among them .
