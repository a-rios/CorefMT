Global Malaise in 2006 ? 
The almighty American consumer had another banner year in 2005 , helping sustain global economic growth , albeit at a slower pace than in 2004 . 
As in recent years , he consumed at or above his income level , and the United States as a whole spent well beyond its means , borrowing from the rest of the world at a feverish pace in 2005 - more than $ 2 billion a day . 
It evidently was sustainable , at least for one more year . 
But it nonetheless remains true that whatever is unsustainable will not be sustained , which creates great risks for the US and global economy in 2006 . 
Two economic surprises prolonged the good times in 2005 . 
First , while the US Federal Reserve continued hiking short-term interest rates , long-terms rates did not increase in tandem , which allowed housing prices to continue rising . 
This was centrally important to sustaining global growth , for the performance of world &apos;s largest economy has been fueled by real estate in recent years , with individuals refinancing their mortgages and spending some of the proceeds , and with high prices leading to more construction . 
But this is unlikely to continue . 
Long-term interest rates almost certainly will eventually start to rise - and &quot; eventually &quot; increasingly looks like next year . 
If so , Americans will have to spend more money on debt service , leaving them with less to spend on consumption of goods and services . 
Moreover , real estate prices will most likely stop rising rapidly - indeed , they may even decline . 
As a result , refinancing of mortgages will grind to a halt , leaving no money to draw out of housing to sustain Americans &quot; consumption binge . 
On both accounts , aggregate demand will decline . 
Is it possible that the cash-rich corporate sector will more than make up for the slack by increasing investment ? 
There may well be some increase in gross investment , as obsolete equipment and software are replaced . 
In any case , even if firms are cash-rich , they do not typically expand investment during periods when consumption is slowing . 
Uncertainties about the economy are likely to insert an element of caution into companies &quot; investment decisions . 
In short , it is more likely that moderating investment will exacerbate the consumer slowdown than that an acceleration of investment will offset it . 
But this is not the only reason for bleaker prospects for America and the world in 2006 . 
The second surprise in 2005 was that while oil prices increased far more than expected , the economic dampening effect seemed somewhat muted in most places , at least until the last part of the year . 
Because of higher oil prices , for example , America &apos;s spending on oil imports has increased by roughly $ 50 billion a year - money that otherwise would have been spent mostly on goods made in America . 
For most of 2005 , Americans behaved as if they didn &apos;t really believe that oil prices would remain high , at least for a while . 
Now , with futures markets predicting that oil will be $ 50 to $ 60 a barrel for the next two years , demand for gas-guzzlers has evaporated , taking with it the prospects for America &apos;s auto companies , whose corporate strategies have bet on low oil prices and America &apos;s love affair with the SUV . 
China &apos;s growth continues to astound the world ; indeed , new GDP data suggest that its economy is 20 % larger than previously thought . 
Moreover , China &apos;s surging growth will echo throughout much of Asia , including ( in somewhat muted form ) in Japan . 
Europe continues to be a mixed picture , with the European Central Bank almost perversely raising interest rates even as Europe &apos;s economy needs further stimulation to ensure its recovery . 
As if that were not bad enough , Germany &apos;s new government is promising to raise taxes . 
Fiscal rectitude in the right place and the right time is to be commended ; but this is the wrong place and the wrong time - and Germany &apos;s recovery prospects will be dampened . 
The main risk in 2006 is that America &apos;s long-brewing problems come to a head globally : investors , finally taking heed of the large structural fiscal deficit , the yawning trade gap , and the high level of household indebtedness , may pull money out of the US in a panic . 
Alternatively , rising interest rates and a downturn in the real estate market could so weaken consumer demand that the economy slips into recession , squeezing exporters in other countries that depend on the US market . 
In either case , the US government , hamstrung by already-wide deficits , may feel powerless to respond with countercyclical fiscal policy . 
With confidence in Bush &apos;s economic management almost as low as confidence in his management of the Iraq war , there is every reason to worry that should one of these crises emerge , it will not be well managed . 
But it is more likely that 2006 will just be another year of malaise : China &apos;s significance within the global economy is still not large enough to offset weaknesses in the rest of the world . 
America , too , will manage to muddle through again - leaving even higher levels of debt for the future . 
In short , 2006 will be marked by mounting uncertainty about prospects for global economic growth , even as the distribution of the fruits of that growth remain dismally predictable . 
In America , at least , 2006 is likely to be another year in which stagnant real wages freeze , or even erode , the living standards of those in the middle .
