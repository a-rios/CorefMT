Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics 
As a final act of his presidency - it will end at the Communist Party meeting beginning November 7 th - China &apos;s Jiang Zemin wants businessmen to join the Party leadership . 
Marx and Mao are probably spinning in their graves . 
Who are these businessmen President Jiang wants to court and how do they operate ? 
Kenichi Ohmae offers a portrait . 
Officially , China remains Communist . 
Yet companies in China face far fewer regulations than in Taiwan , Korea , Japan , Germany , France , and Sweden . 
Even in comparison with the US , China is a capitalist paradise - so long as you steer clear of the central government . 
For example , tariffs ( which are set by the central government , but administered locally ) are low or nonexistent for companies that take advantage of China &apos;s regional systems of tax-free zones and tax benefits . 
None of this was conceivable as recently as 1992 , when Beijing &apos;s proclamation of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; - and the decision to peg the mainland &apos;s currency , the Renminbi , to the Hong Kong dollar - unleashed the floodgates of foreign investment . 
Money poured into the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets , as did direct investment to build factories and offices in tax-free zones . 
The trappings of entrepreneurial culture are everywhere . 
The face of General Electric &apos;s longtime boss Jack Welch is in bookstore windows across China , although his latest book is probably a pirated edition because China still has a way to go on copyright protection . 
Many managers attended China &apos;s elite foreign language schools ( which trained spies during the Cold War era ) and then headed to America for an MBA . 
Back home , they practice just-in-time manufacturing , 360-degree performance evaluations ( including bosses reviewed by subordinates ) , and re-engineering - all with unmatched resourcefulness and purposefulness . 
In fact , more students than ever who left for universities in Japan , the US , and Europe are being lured back . 
The Dalian local government constructed an elaborate software development park à la Silicon Valley , where students returning from abroad can rent low-cost office space for startup companies . 
They benefit from broadband network environments , introductions to investors and financial angels , and exposure to each other . 
Like rival businesses in a single large corporation , other cities are creating their own incubators and lures for talent as well . 
As a result , China &apos;s reputation for lackluster innovation is changing . 
Consider the story of Shenyang-based Neusoft Group , China &apos;s largest publicly traded software company , with sales of $ 134 million last year . 
Neusoft began as a low-cost competitor to the Oracle Corporation . 
After moving on to produce car audio equipment , Liu Jiren , Neusoft &apos;s CEO , began hearing complaints from local hospitals about the high cost of specialized X-ray , MRI , ultrasound , and CT-scanning machines ( such as those made by GE , Philips , Siemens , and Toshiba ) . 
Suddenly , a new business was born . 
Liu realized that Neusoft could link standard Intel chips and its own imaging software to a range of digital sensors . 
Neusoft &apos;s equipment looks like little personal computers with sensors attached . 
In the US or Japan , facing entrenched industry opposition , such a startup might never have gotten off the ground . 
But by selling to Chinese hospitals first , Neusoft built up a customer base that will allow it to challenge the existing medical electronics industry worldwide , just as Honda and Toyota challenged the worldwide auto industry in the 1970s . 
Nor is Neusoft alone . 
Little Swan sells washing machines in 40 countries , while Legend Group is now the world &apos;s largest manufacturer of personal computers ( mostly sold under other brand names ) . 
Hua Wei , based in Shenzhen with 14,000 employees ( 70 % of whom are engineers ) , makes routers and telecommunications switches at half the price of most global companies . 
Many leading American and European telephone equipment manufacturers fear Hua Wei more than Fujitsu or NEC . 
The Chinese have grasped the hidden key to Japan &apos;s success in the 1970s and 1980s . 
Companies like Toshiba and Sony depended on two regions - Otaku in Tokyo , and Higashi Osaka in Osaka Prefecture -where thousands of manufacturers of precision mechanical and electronic components were clustered . 
Today , Otaku and Higashi Osaka are anachronisms . 
With modern highways , port facilities , and communications links available , a cellular phone manufacturer in Shenzhen might receive just-in-time deliveries of parts several times a day from suppliers that are only hours away . 
Similar manufacturing clusters are sprouting up everywhere in China . 
Dalian is becoming a center for software development and Japanese-language back-office work , such as insurance processing and call centers . 
Japanese companies also prefer Qingdao , on the Shandong Peninsula , which specializes in production of high-quality processed food . 
More than 4,000 Taiwanese manufacturers have set up shop in Xiamen and Dongguan . 
Zhongguancun , a former military research zone in Beijing that houses half a million scientists and engineers , is popular with American high-tech companies . 
All this clustering resulted in state-of-the-art production and cutting-edge business . 
Consider Japan &apos;s Fast Retailing Company , which retails high-quality clothing manufactured in China under the Uniqlo brand in its own Japanese outlets . 
Fast Retailing charges one-third the price that competitors charge and earns nearly five times the margin . 
The verb &quot; to uniqlo-ize &quot; ( to cut costs dramatically through Chinese production and eliminating intermediaries ) has entered Japan &apos;s business vernacular , as in : &quot; Can we uniqlo-ize the housing industry ? &quot; 
The US confronted something similar in the late 1980s . 
It responded by internalizing foreign competitors like Sony , Toyota , Bayer , Nestlé , and DaimlerChrysler - in effect turning them into US companies with US investors , loyalties , and even corporate cultures . 
The challenge for the US , Europe , and Japan will now be to internalize Chinese companies and methods in order to galvanize their own to higher levels of productivity and innovation .
