Managing Iraq \ u0027s Oil 
In recent months , Iraq &apos;s oil production has grown to more than two million barrels per day . 
At this rate , current oil output and oil exports now exceed post-invasion predictions . 
Experts had argued that funding shortages , lack of security , the problems of stabilizing a legitimate government , and technology shortfalls would severely limit Iraq &apos;s output . 
Despite the odds , Iraq &apos;s daily output reached a post-invasion record of 2.5 million barrels in March . 
A number of factors enabled Iraq to increase its output . 
Most significantly , the Bush administration gave Iraq $ 2.3 billion to restore its oil production . 
After the invasion , no one expected Iraq to get loans , let alone outright grants . 
Instead , $ 2.3 billion was invested directly into the Iraqi oil sector . 
To protect the oil fields and other facilities , the Americans dedicated a massive , overwhelming force of soldiers and private contractors . 
The level of protection was unprecedented even compared to Saddam &apos;s regime . 
On the technical side , the Bush administration hired the world &apos;s best oil service companies to revamp Iraq &apos;s technologically challenged oil fields . 
They still have a long way to go , but significant improvements are already evident . 
Moreover , the war didn &apos;t change the quality of Iraqi fields , which are still among the richest in the world and can produce oil with relatively little effort and investment . 
Finally , high oil prices in the past 12 months provided an unexpectedly large windfall to the Iraqi budget , allowing for the financing of other sectors without slighting the oil industry . 
High prices also enabled the Coalition Provisional Authority to add even more private security personnel to protect refineries and pipelines . 
Granting Iraq the money to restore its oil industry was one of the best post-war decisions that the Bush administration has made . 
The money allowed Iraq to begin to address security , production , and technology issues throughout its oil system . 
But the question remains : will output growth continue following the transfer of sovereignty to an Iraqi government at the end of June ? 
Despite massive injections of funds and unprecedented security , insurgents have still managed to halt or reduce oil production and exports several times since the invasion . 
The bombing of a pipeline or other oil facility somewhere in Iraq remains almost a daily occurrence , and the transfer of power has not reduced these attacks so far . 
Like the Bush administration and Saddam himself , the insurgents understand that whoever controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq &apos;s destiny . 
The new Iraqi government , even supported by US military might , will simply not be able to guarantee a predictable flow of oil , and output will remain quite volatile . 
At the same time , maintaining the flow of funds into the Iraqi oil sector is essential , not only for its growth , but for its very survival . 
Money brings technological regeneration as well as security . 
Under even the best circumstances for Iraq , with oil prices remaining high , the funds available to maintain and modernize the oil industry are limited . 
If oil prices decline in the future , the oil industry will suffer severely . 
This makes for an interesting relationship between Iraq and Saudi Arabia . 
Only Saudi Arabia can manage the global output of oil in such a way that will make room for Iraqi oil and keep prices high . 
In contrast , only Saudi Arabia can flood the market and reduce prices far below their current level . 
A decline in oil revenues could be devastating to the fledgling Iraqi government . 
Current oil revenues are barely enough to cover state expenses , let alone pay for reconstruction , debt , and war reparations . 
Even if President Bush wins reelection , it is highly unlikely that the US will make another outright grant to a sovereign Iraq . 
Theoretically , international loans could be an alternative , but who would lend to an unstable government , let alone a government whose legitimacy has not been fully established ? 
Likewise , privatization is out of the picture for now . 
The new government will have to make do and chart a slow path for its oil recovery , just as Saddam &apos;s regime did . 
At the same time , the logic of renewed American support for the Iraqi oil industry remains powerful . 
Normal financing is not forthcoming . 
Only grants from the US will reduce output volatility . 
Saddam &apos;s regime caused most of the volatility in the oil market in the last 30 years . 
In fact , every peak in oil prices since 1973 was caused by an event related to Iraq . 
One would hope that his removal would reduce market volatility and stabilize oil prices . 
Unfortunately , Iraq appears set to continue to be a major source of high oil prices , owing to highly erratic output . 
For the foreseeable future , one of the principal outcomes of the invasion of Iraq will be greater volatility and thus higher prices .
