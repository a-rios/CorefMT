Climate Hysteria 
You would have had to be stuck in deepest Mongolia to avoid hearing that the United Nations &quot; climate panel , the IPCC , issued a new report last week . 
Perhaps even in the depths of Mongolia , you would have heard the dire warnings emitted by journalists . 
You would have distilled from these agonized noises that the report concluded that global warming is worse than we had imagined , and that we need to take swift and strong action right now . 
You would have been misinformed . 
The IPCC has produced a good report - an attempt to summarize what the world &apos;s scientists know about global warming . 
Unlike the Bush administration , caught downplaying the science , the IPCC squarely tells us that mankind is largely responsible for the planet &apos;s recent warming . 
And , unlike Al Gore , who has travelled the world warning that our cities might soon be under the oceans , it refrains from scaremongering . 
But lost among the hype is the unexciting fact that this report is actually no more dire than the IPCC &apos;s last report , issued in 2001 . 
In two important ways , this year &apos;s effort was actually less dire . 
The report reflected the fact that since 2001 , scientists have become more certain that humans are responsible for a large part of global warming . 
Otherwise , though , this report had a definite sense of déjà vu . 
Estimates of temperature increases , heat waves , and cold waves are all nearly identical to those produced six years ago . 
The report did , however , contain two surprising facts . 
Both went unmentioned in most reports . 
First , the world &apos;s scientists have re-jigged their estimates about how much sea levels will rise . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , America &apos;s Environmental Protection Agency expected oceans to rise by several metres by 2100 . 
By the 1990 &quot; s , the IPCC was expecting a 67-centimeter rise . 
Six years ago , it anticipated ocean levels would be 48.5 centimeters higher than they are currently . 
In this year &apos;s report , the estimated rise is 38.5 centimeters on average . 
This is especially interesting since it fundamentally rejects one of the most harrowing scenes from Al Gore &apos;s movie An Inconvenient Truth . 
In graphic detail , Gore demonstrated how a 20-foot rise in the sea level would inundate much of Florida , Shanghai , and Holland . 
The IPCC report makes it clear that exaggerations of this magnitude have no basis in science - though clearly they frightened people and perhaps will win Gore an Academy Award . 
The report also revealed the improbability of another Gore scenario : that global warming could make the Gulf Stream shut down , turning Europe into a new Siberia . 
The IPCC simply and tersely tells us that this scenario - also vividly depicted in the Hollywood movie The Day After Tomorrow - is considered &quot; very unlikely . &quot; 
Moreover , even if the Gulf Stream were to weaken over the century , this would be good , as there would be less net warming over land areas . 
So why have we been left with a very different impression of the climate panel &apos;s report ? 
The IPCC is by statute &quot; politically neutral &quot; - it is supposed to tell us just the facts and leave the rest to politicians and the people who elect them . 
This is why the report is a careful and sensible document . 
But scientists and journalists - acting as intermediaries between the report and the public - have engaged in greenhouse activism . 
Elsewhere calling for immediate and substantial cuts in carbon emissions , the IPCC &apos;s director even declared that he hoped the IPCC report would &quot; shock people , governments into taking more serious action . &quot; 
It is inappropriate for somebody in such an important and apolitical role to engage in blatant activism . 
Imagine if the director of the CIA published a new assessment of Iran , saying &quot; I hope this report will shock people , governments into taking more serious action . &quot; 
Climate change is a real and serious problem . 
But the problem with the recent media frenzy is that some seem to believe no new report or development is enough if it doesn &apos;t reveal more serious consequences and more terrifying calamities than humanity has ever considered before . 
Indeed , this media frenzy has little or no scientific backing . 
One of England &apos;s foremost climatologists , Mike Hulme , director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , points out that green militancy and megaphone journalism use &quot; catastrophe and chaos as unguided weapons with which forlornly to threaten society into behavioral change . &quot; 
In his words , &quot; we need to take a deep breath and pause . &quot; 
A 38.5 cm rise in the ocean &apos;s levels is a problem , but by no means will it bring down civilization . 
Last century sea levels rose by half that amount without most of us even noticing . 
The UN tells us that there is virtually nothing we can do that would affect climate change before 2030 . 
When Nobel Laureate economists weighed up how to achieve the most good for the world in a recent project called the Copenhagen Consensus , they found that focusing on HIV / AIDS , malaria , malnutrition , and trade barriers should all be tackled long before we commit to any dramatic action on climate change . 
With the world in a fury about cutting greenhouse gasses , it is easy to forget that there are other and better ways to do some good for the planet . 
Good decisions come from careful consideration . 
The IPCC report provides that . 
But the cacophony of screaming that has accompanied it does not help .
