In Praise of Global Imbalances 
SINGAPORE - In recent weeks , there has been a chorus of opinion arguing for a sharp increase in global investment , particularly in infrastructure . 
Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers asserted that public investment really is a free lunch , while IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde has argued that an investment boost is needed if the world economy is to &quot; overcome a new mediocre . &quot; 
These comments suggest that the world has been under-investing for many years . 
In fact , according to International Monetary Fund data , the current overall global investment rate , at 24.5 % of world GDP , is near the top of its long-term range . 
The issue is not a lack of overall investment , but the fact that a disproportionate share of it comes from China . 
China &apos;s share of world investment has soared from 4.3 % in 1995 to an estimated 25.8 % this year . 
By contrast , the United States &quot; share , which peaked at 36 % in 1985 , has fallen to less than 18 % . 
The decline in Japan &apos;s share has been more dramatic , from a peak of 22 % in 1993 to just 5.7 % in 2013 . 
China dominates global investment because it saves and invests nearly half of its $ 10.5 trillion economy . 
Moreover , China &apos;s rapidly aging population and declining working-age population will reduce long-term investment demand . 
Because the current-account balance is the difference between the investment and savings rates , the decline in investment will generate large surpluses unless savings also decline . 
Thus , China can expect large external surpluses to transform the country from the world &apos;s workshop into its main financier . 
Indeed , the scale of capital outflows could be so large that long-term capital will remain cheap even after the world &apos;s major central banks tighten monetary policy . 
How the world absorbs those surpluses will define the next period of global economic expansion . 
Emerging markets may be able to take some advantage of this low-cost financing . 
India would undoubtedly benefit , though it is unlikely to absorb a significant portion of China &apos;s excess savings . 
India &apos;s share of world investment is only 3.4 % ; and even a large expansion will not compensate for a small decline in Chinese investment . 
Furthermore , East Asia &apos;s growth model has been sustained ultimately by mobilizing rising domestic savings and pumping out exports . 
So , although India might initially absorb some international capital , it might ultimately prefer to build foreign reserves by running small external deficits or even a surplus . 
Other emerging countries are also unlikely to absorb much of China &apos;s capital . 
Notwithstanding its advocacy of public investment spending , even the IMF accepts that a sudden increase in public investment is more likely to cause developing-country indebtedness than growth . 
That is why calls by the IMF and others to scale up public infrastructure spending are really aimed at developed countries . 
Yet this , too , may prove insufficient . 
Germany &apos;s investment-savings gap is so large that , even if it increases domestic investment , the most we can expect from Europe is that it does not add to the global savings glut . 
Only a revival in US infrastructure investment can create a sustained global economic recovery . 
The US has the necessary scale to absorb China &apos;s surplus , and its inadequate infrastructure provides plenty of avenues for fruitful investment . 
Ironically , the IMF &apos;s new investment mantra ultimately leads back to large global imbalances . 
Indeed , almost every period of globalization and prosperity has been accompanied by symbiotic imbalances . 
They have always caused economic distortions and political complaints , but many have endured for surprisingly long periods . 
Consider , for example , the Indo-Roman trade that drove the world economy in the first and second centuries AD . 
Similarly , the first Bretton Woods system was sustained with European capital , and Bretton Woods 2 was fueled by Asian capital , with the US providing the deficits in both cases . 
There is no reason why Bretton Woods 3 should not experience similar imbalances . 
These are not the sort of imbalances to which the world &apos;s policymakers should aspire .
