The Dragon and the Bear 
Second honeymoons rarely , if ever , recapture the zest of lost love . 
Yet ever since the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse in 1991 , Russia and China have sought to rekindle the close relations that once supposedly existed between the USSR and Mao &apos;s China before Khrushchev &apos;s denunciation of Stalin in 1956 . 
But that renewed Sino-Russian marriage always smacked more of convenience - aimed as it was at checking American hegemony - than of true romance . 
Now Russia &apos;s invasion of Georgia has shattered even the illusion of attraction . 
In 1969 , the Chinese and Soviet armies exchanged fire across their disputed border . 
Recently , the two countries signed an agreement that seemed to put an end to their long border dispute . 
During Vladimir Putin &apos;s presidency , Chinese and Russian troops engaged in joint military maneuvers , and the two countries became dominant powers in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) , which , to some Western observers , looked like an effort to counterbalance NATO . 
There were also years of &quot; Russia in China &quot; and &quot; China in Russia &quot; cultural exchanges , meant to underscore that the two countries were tied together not just by geopolitical pragmatism , but by genuine cultural / historical ties as well . 
But the fact is that 17 years of high-level bilateral cooperation have produced little of substance . 
Indeed , in the wake of the invasion of Georgia , China may be seriously rethinking its relations with Russia . 
It may not yet be ready to embark on a full-fledged policy of &quot; containment , &quot; but in the wake of the dismemberment of Georgia - and with Russia claiming a zone of &quot; privileged influence &quot; throughout the former Soviet world - China clearly views Russia as an emerging strategic threat . 
For example , China has refused to endorse Russia &apos;s recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , and has encouraged the SCO &apos;s other members to do the same . 
The reasons are not hard to find . 
As a general principle of foreign policy , China believes that national borders are sacrosanct . 
No power , not even the United Nations , should be allowed to change them without the consent of the country concerned . 
More importantly , China views the break-up of the USSR as one of the greatest strategic gifts in its history . 
Instead of confronting a ( usually hostile ) Russian / Soviet empire on its border , a vast swath of buffer states appeared after 1991 . 
Their continued independence is now deemed essential to China &apos;s national security . 
As a result , any more Russian efforts to establish even informal suzerainty over the Soviet successor states are , following the dismemberment of Georgia , likely to meet Chinese resistance . 
The economic components of the Sino-Russian relationship - where real attachments are tested - are also dissatisfactory , at least from China &apos;s point of view . 
China &apos;s major interest in Russia is oil and gas . 
But , while Russia is firmly committed to being a major supplier of gas and oil to Europe , it is hesitant to play a similar role with China . 
Moreover , Russia &apos;s efforts to gain monopoly control of the gas pipeline networks across Eurasia pose a direct danger for China , because monopolists can not only gouge their consumers , but also shut off supplies for political purposes , as Russia has done repeatedly over the past two decades . 
So China &apos;s national security interest is to ensure that the gas-supplying nations of Central Asia have outlets to sell their gas that are not under Kremlin control . 
Other than oil , gas , and other commodities , China has rather limited interests in Russia . 
Russia has been China &apos;s major supplier of weapons since the late 1990 &quot; s . 
Indeed , although the war with Georgia demonstrated the revived combat spirit of the Russian army - at least when compared to its ineptness in the two Chechen wars of the 1990 &quot; s - it also exhibited the grave defects of Russian military technology . 
Most of the arms used were yesterday &apos;s weapons . 
As China is now able to harness its own technological might to produce sophisticated weapons , Russia &apos;s usefulness in this area is waning fast . 
Nor do the Chinese have much interest in assuming de facto control of Asiatic Russia , despite shrieks from Russian strategic pundits that this is China &apos;s real goal . 
China might , indeed , have an interest in some border areas with fertile soil and moderate climate . 
In fact , Siberia is not much different from China &apos;s own almost empty mountain / desert borderlands , where even agriculture is a daunting task . 
As for Russia &apos;s Far East , the Chinese believe it will eventually fall to China anyway , so there is no need to hasten the process . 
China is far more interested in focusing on the United States , its major trade partner and rival , and on South Asia and Iran , which supplies much of China &apos;s oil and regards it as a more reliable ally than Russia . 
Thus , the settling of the border dispute with Russia was not aimed so much at building a geopolitical marriage as securing each other &apos;s rear , offering both sides a free hand to explore opportunities elsewhere . 
What China wants and what it gets may be different things . 
With its long borders with Russia , China knows it would have much to regret if a new , oil-fired Russian empire appeared on its doorstep .
