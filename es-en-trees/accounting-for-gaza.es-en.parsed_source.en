Accounting for Gaza 
New York - This week the United Nations Human Rights Council will debate the report of the fact-finding mission led by Judge Richard Goldstone on human rights violations in the Gaza conflict . 
Let us hope it is a full and fair examination based on the report &apos;s findings and recommendations . 
Goldstone and his team concluded that both Israel and Hamas , the Palestinian group controlling Gaza , committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity during the period of the conflict which the investigation addressed . The report calls for credible investigations of alleged rights violations and recommends that the UN Security Council require both sides to report back within six months on the results , including any prosecutions they will carry out in connection with the violations identified . 
Failure to do so , in the view of Goldstone &apos;s commission , should result in the Security Council referring the matter to the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court in The Hague . 
Unfortunately , rather than debating Goldstone &apos;s detailed findings and the merits of his recommendations on ways to move forward , there are indications that governments may focus instead on the process leading up to the investigation and seek to limit full discussion of the report . 
As someone involved in that process , I feel it is important to put my views on record , as comments I made previously are now being used as part of the effort to undermine Judge Goldstone and his important work . 
I refused to accept the invitation from the president of the Human Rights Council at the time , Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi of Nigeria , to lead the investigation following the Human Rights Council &apos;s January 12 , 2009 resolution . As a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , I felt strongly that the Council &apos;s resolution was one-sided and did not permit a balanced approach to determining the situation on the ground . 
It referred only to &quot; the grave violations of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory , particularly due to the recent Israeli military attacks , &quot; and called for a mission to investigate &quot; all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by the occupying power , Israel , against the Palestinian people . &quot; 
I was also aware that the UN Human Rights Council had made repeated condemnations of Israel over the past two years but had focused little attention on large-scale violations of human rights in other countries . 
This pattern of action and inaction by the Council has given greater credence to those who believe the UN &apos;s highest human rights body is inherently anti-Israel . 
I decided I could not undertake the mission for these reasons . 
I am aware that Judge Goldstone , a dedicated and unimpeachable human rights lawyer and advocate , shared similar concerns when he was initially approached . 
But he was able to work with the Council &apos;s president to secure an agreement he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as to allow his team to address the actions taken by 
Experts can debate whether this was in conformity with UN rules and procedures . 
I have no doubt that those involved were seeking a way forward that would allow for a full investigation and help overcome the political divisiveness currently undermining the Human Rights Council within the UN system . 
The question now is whether governments will give Judge Goldstone &apos;s findings the serious attention they deserve , or instead fall back into an overtly political posture . 
As Goldstone &apos;s report makes clear : 
Both the Palestinians and the Israelis are legitimately angered at the lives that they are forced to lead : For the Palestinians , the anger about individual events - the civilian casualties , injuries and destruction in Gaza following from military attacks , the blockade , the continued construction of the Wall outside of the 1967 borders - feed into an underlying anger about the continuing Israeli occupation , its daily humiliations and their as-yet-unfulfilled right to self-determination . 
For the Israelis , the public statements of Palestinian armed groups celebrating rocket and mortar attacks on civilians strengthen a deep-rooted concern that negotiation will yield little and that their nation remains under existential threat from which only it can protect its people . 
In this way , both the Israelis and the Palestinians share a secret fear - for some , a belief - that each has no intention of accepting the other &apos;s right to a country of their own . 
This anger and fear are unfortunately ably represented by many politicians . ( Para . 
For the sake of human rights and peace in the region , my hope is that the international community will bear witness to these circumstances , consider Judge Goldstone &apos;s report in its entirety and press for accountability for the most serious crimes .
