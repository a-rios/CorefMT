King Coal &apos;s Climate Policy 
COPENHAGEN - The United Nations Climate Change Treaty , signed in 1992 , committed the world to &quot; avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system . &quot; 
Yet , since that time , greenhouse-gas emissions have continued to soar . 
The United States has proved to be the biggest laggard in the world , refusing to sign the 1997 Kyoto Protocol or to adopt any effective domestic emissions controls . 
As we head into the global summit in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a successor to the Kyoto Protocol , the US is once again the focus of concern . 
Even now , American politics remains strongly divided over climate change - though President Barack Obama has new opportunities to break the logjam . 
A year after the 1992 treaty , President Bill Clinton tried to pass an energy tax that would have helped the US to begin reducing its dependence on fossil fuels . 
The proposal not only failed , but also triggered a political backlash . 
When the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 , Clinton did not even send it to the US Senate for ratification , knowing that it would be rejected . 
President George W. Bush repudiated the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 and did essentially nothing on climate change during his presidency . 
There are several reasons for US inaction - including ideology and scientific ignorance - but a lot comes down to one word : coal . 
No fewer than 25 states produce coal , which not only generates income , jobs , and tax revenue , but also provides a disproportionately large share of their energy . 
Per capita carbon emissions in US coal states tend to be much higher than the national average . 
Since addressing climate change is first and foremost directed at reduced emissions from coal - the most carbon-intensive of all fuels - America &apos;s coal states are especially fearful about the economic implications of any controls ( though the oil and automobile industries are not far behind ) . 
The US political system poses special problems as well . 
To ratify a treaty requires the support of 67 of the Senate &apos;s 100 members , a nearly impossible hurdle . 
The Republican Party , with its 40 Senate seats , is simply filled with too many ideologues - and , indeed , too many senators intent on derailing any Obama initiative - to offer enough votes to reach the 67-vote threshold . 
Moreover , the Democratic Party includes senators from coal and oil states who are unlikely to support decisive action . 
The idea this time around is to avoid the need for 67 votes , at least at the start , by focusing on domestic legislation rather than a treaty . 
Under the US Constitution , domestic legislation ( as opposed to international treaties ) requires a simple majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate to be sent to the president for signature . 
Getting 50 votes for a climate-change bill ( with a tie vote broken by the vice president ) is almost certain . 
But opponents of legislation can threaten to filibuster ( speak for an indefinite period and thereby paralyze Senate business ) , which can be ended only if 60 senators support bringing the legislation to a vote . 
Otherwise , proposed legislation can be killed , even if it has the support of a simple majority . 
That will certainly be true of domestic climate-change legislation . 
Securing 60 votes is a steep hill to climb . 
Political analysts know that the votes will depend on individual senators &quot; ideologies , states &quot; voting patterns , and states &quot; dependence on coal relative to other energy sources . 
Based on these factors , one analysis counts 50 likely Democratic &quot; Yes &quot; votes and 34 Republican &quot; No &quot; votes , leaving 16 votes still in play . 
Ten of the swing votes are Democrats , mainly from coal states ; the other six are Republicans who conceivably could vote with the president and the Democratic majority . 
Until recently , many believed that China and India would be the real holdouts in the global climate-change negotiations . 
Yet China has announced a set of major initiatives - in solar , wind , nuclear , and carbon-capture technologies - to reduce its economy &apos;s greenhouse-gas intensity . 
India , long feared to be a spoiler , has said that it is ready to adopt a significant national action plan to move towards a trajectory of sustainable energy . 
These actions put the US under growing pressure to act . 
With developing countries displaying their readiness to reach a global deal , could the US Senate really prove to be the world &apos;s last great holdout ? 
Obama has tools at his command to bring the US into the global mainstream on climate change . 
First , he is negotiating side deals with holdout senators to cushion the economic impact on coal states and to increase US investments in the research and development , and eventually adoption , of clean-coal technologies . 
Second , he can command the Environmental Protection Agency to impose administrative controls on coal plants and automobile producers even if the Congress does not pass new legislation . 
The administrative route might turn out to be even more important than the legislative route . 
The politics of the US Senate should not obscure the larger point : America has acted irresponsibly since signing the climate treaty in 1992 . 
It is the world &apos;s largest and most powerful country , and the one most responsible for the climate change to this point , it has behaved without any sense of duty - to its own citizens , to the world , and to future generations . 
Even coal-state senators should be ashamed . 
Sure , their states need some extra help , but narrow interests should not be permitted to endanger our planet &apos;s future . 
It is time for the US to rejoin the global family .
