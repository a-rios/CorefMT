Who Are Tomorrow &apos;s Consumers ? 
SINGAPORE - Luxury-brand companies &quot; stock prices plunged in July , after their financial results disappointed investors , owing largely to slower sales in emerging markets , especially in China . 
Meanwhile , news reports indicate that high-end shopping malls in India and China are increasingly empty . 
What is going on ? 
Many analysts had expected emerging markets to generate exponential growth over the next decade . 
But now there is talk of how the global crisis is slowing down these economies and killing off discretionary spending . 
But a slowdown in China &apos;s economic growth cannot really be blamed for slower sales of luxury goods or empty malls . 
The annual growth rate of China &apos;s $ 7.5 trillion economy decelerated to 7.6 % in the second quarter , from 8.1 % in January-March - hardly a cause for panic . 
Moreover , two-thirds of the decline is attributable to slower investment rather than slower consumption . 
For all of China &apos;s long-term structural problems , it is not exactly slipping into recession . 
The real problem is that many analysts had exaggerated the size of the luxury-goods segment in emerging markets . 
China is by far the largest emerging-market economy , with 1.6 million households that can be called &quot; rich &quot; ( defined as having annual disposable income of more than $ 150,000 ) . 
But this is still smaller than Japan &apos;s 4.6 million and a fraction of the 19.2 million rich households in the United States . 
The number of rich households amounts to barely 0.7 million in India and one million in Brazil . 
The point is that developed countries still dominate the income bracket that can afford luxury goods . 
The explosive growth recorded by this segment in emerging markets in recent years reflected entry into previously untapped markets , with the subsequent slowdown resulting from saturation . 
The number of high-income households is still growing , but not enough to justify the 30-40 % compounded growth rates expected by some . 
This does not mean that growth opportunities in emerging markets have disappeared , but expectations do need to be recalibrated . 
Despite the economic boom of the last decade , China still has 164 million households that can be called &quot; poor &quot; ( with annual disposable income of less than $ 5,000 ) and another 172 million that are &quot; aspirant &quot; ( between $ 5,000- $ 15,000 ) . 
Similarly , India has 104 million poor households and 107 million aspirant households . 
The real story for the next two decades will be these countries &quot; shift to middle-class status . 
Although other emerging regions will undergo a similar shift , Asia will dominate this transformation . 
A study by the economist Homi Kharas of the Brookings Institution gives us a sense of the scale of this change . 
He estimates that 18 % of the world &apos;s middle class lived in North America in 2009 , while another 36 % lived in Europe . 
Asia &apos;s share was 28 % ( after including Japan ) . 
But Kharas &apos;s projections suggest that Asia will account for two-thirds of the world &apos;s middle class by 2030 . 
In other words , Asia will displace not just the West , but even other emerging regions . 
This is the real business opportunity . 
Of course , the rise of Asia &apos;s middle class is not the only change we should expect . 
We are in the middle of a social and demographic shift that will both destroy and create consumer markets . 
The aging of developed markets is well known , but the latest data show that emerging markets are aging at an even faster pace . 
China &apos;s median age is today 34.5 years , compared to 36.9 years for the US . 
However , the average Chinese will be 42.5 years old by 2030 , compared to 39.1 for the average American . 
The median Russian will be even older , at 43.3 years . 
The impact of aging is already being felt in these countries &quot; education systems . 
The number of students enrolled in primary schools in China has fallen by 18 % since 1990 , and by an astonishing 33 % in South Korea . 
At the other end of the demographic scale , the share of the aged is growing explosively . 
Meanwhile , the nature of the basic consuming unit - the household - is also changing rapidly . 
In most developed countries , the traditional nuclear family is in severe decline and is being replaced by single-individual households . 
In Germany , for example , 39 % of households consist of just one person . 
Couples with children now account for barely 19 % and 22 % of households in the United Kingdom and the US , respectively . 
Nevertheless , it is not all about consumer atomization . 
We are simultaneously witnessing the re-emergence of the multigenerational extended family , with as many as 22 % of American adults in the 25-35 age group living with parents or relatives . 
By contrast , the extended family is giving way in India to nuclear families , which now account for 64 % of households . 
All of these changes will profoundly affect the future of consumer markets . 
For example , we need to revise our mental image of the nuclear family from American suburbia to fit the rapidly expanding cities of India . 
By the same token , our mental image of the multigenerational extended family needs to include those in the West . 
An aging but increasingly middle-class Asia will be at the core of this new consumer landscape .
