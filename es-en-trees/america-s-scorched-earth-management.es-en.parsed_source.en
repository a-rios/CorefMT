America &apos;s Scorched Earth Management 
Signs of the American economy &apos;s perilous condition are everywhere - from yawning fiscal and current-account deficits to plummeting home prices and a feeble dollar . 
But something that shows up in none of the economic indicators may be driving many of them : the deterioration of American management , which is undermining not only many of America &apos;s great enterprises , but also its legendary spirit of enterprise . 
Paradoxically , one indicator that has been improving steadily in the US - productivity - may be the clearest sign of the problem . 
When it comes to productivity , managers either invest in employee training , more efficient manufacturing processes , and the like , or they take steps that appear to boost productivity in the short run but that erode it in the long run . 
Productivity is a measure of output per hour worked . 
So a company that fires all its workers and then ships from stock can look very productive - until it runs outs of stock . 
Of course , no company can do that , but many US companies have been shedding workers and middle managers in great numbers - the figures for January 2008 were up 19 % from a year earlier . 
Meanwhile , those employees left behind must work that much harder , often without increased compensation . 
Workers &quot; wages , adjusted for inflation , fell in 2007 , continuing a trend throughout this decade . 
That , too , is &quot; productive &quot; - until these overworked people quit or burn out . 
A sustainable company is not a collection of &quot; human resources . &quot; 
It is a community of human beings . 
Its strength resides in its people , its culture , and the goodwill it has built up among its customers and suppliers . 
So , as workers and middle managers have been departing these companies , they have taken with them not only much critical information , but often also the hearts and souls of their enterprises , with profound effects on American competitiveness . 
Consider high technology , where America is supposed to excel . 
According to a November 2006 report by The Task Force on the Future of American Innovation , made up of prominent universities , think tanks , industry trade associations , and corporations , the high-tech trade deficit widened in 2005 , for the third consecutive year . 
This is not clothing or cars , but America &apos;s largest , and most renowned , export sector . 
This deficit reflects an underlying research deficit . 
Of the 25 companies granted the most US patents in 2006 , only eight were American ; 12 were Japanese . 
Perhaps this helps to explain why , in a survey of more than 60,000 people in 29 countries conducted in 2007 by the New York-based Reputation Institute to rank the &quot; world &apos;s most respected companies , &quot; the first US company on the list appeared in 15th place ; the second was in 25th place . 
No one can determine how much of America &apos;s productivity gains in recent years have resulted from squeezing human capital , because such things are not measured . 
But there has clearly been a great deal of reliance on this strategy , with companies shedding employees not only because they must , but often because they have not met Wall Street analysts &quot; financial expectations . 
Managers &quot; increased focus on maximizing shareholder value won many adherents when the idea was introduced in the 1980 &quot; s : the impersonal discipline of financial markets would force companies to become more productive and innovative . 
And , in fact , much of the US productivity increase in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s can likely be attributed to large-scale investment in information and communications technology . 
But , as the marginal productivity gains from such investment began to fall , senior managers &quot; survival and compensation continued to be tied to stock-market performance . 
As a result , many simply learned to manage their companies &quot; short-term share price at the expense of attention to their products and customers . 
Moreover , because maximizing shareholder value is a poor incentive for workers and middle managers , companies &quot; boards have increasingly centralized power around chief executives , thereby encouraging a &quot; heroic &quot; form of leadership that is detached from the rest of the enterprise . 
Indeed , in many cases , the CEO - frequently a Wall Street-endorsed &quot; superstar &quot; parachuted in to &quot; shake things up &quot; - now 
This shift to &quot; heroic &quot; leadership can be seen in ballooning CEO compensation . 
According to a January 2008 report by the Hay Group , the CEO &apos;s of the 50 largest US companies are now paid almost three times what their European counterparts receive ­ - which is many hundreds of times more than their own workers . 
Until recently , the US asset-price bubble ­ - first in the stock market , then in real estate - masked the underlying depreciation of American enterprises . 
But the bubble itself resulted from the same management pathologies as those afflicting the real economy . 
After all , managing for the short run encouraged mortgage lenders to offer artificially low &quot; teaser &quot; interest rates to lure potential homeowners . 
And then those who bought these mortgages never bothered to investigate their underlying value - a spectacular abdication of managerial responsibility . 
Now that the bubble has burst , America &apos;s current economic downturn is likely to be far worse than previous ones , because US enterprises will have to be rebuilt , slowly and carefully . 
The dramatic weakening of the US dollar may help America to narrow its massive trade deficit , but we should not expect any sustained improvement without drastic changes in American management . 
Fortunately , it may be possible to minimize the fallout for the rest of the world . 
While American economists , politicians , and business leaders have for years sought to sell their model of management abroad , many companies elsewhere have not been buying it . 
As a result , other key economies remain healthier than America &apos;s . 
Make no mistake : this problem was made in America , and that is where it will have to be solved .
