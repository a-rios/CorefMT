Learning Economic Dynamism 
Why are some of the world &apos;s most advanced economies - France , Germany , Italy , and Japan - suffering stagnant growth and high unemployment ? 
More fundamentally , why do these countries seemingly fail to exercise the kind of economic leadership and innovation that their histories lead us to expect , especially in the innovative high technology sectors that most define our future ? 
Weak economic performance in these countries is even more puzzling in view of the sharp drop in their birthrates decades ago . 
Their population pyramids are now skewed towards middle-aged people who are in their most productive years and relatively free from the burden of raising children . 
Their per capita living standards should thus be substantially higher than in the US , where swarms of kids must be attended to and where new investments must be made just to keep the capital stock growing in step with a swelling population . 
Of course , what is advantageous today may be problematic tomorrow : Europe and Japan will face severe problems when their demographic pyramids tilt towards the elderly , eliminating the temporary demographic advantage they have relative to the US today . 
But this isn &apos;t what ails their economies now . 
Edmund Phelps of Columbia University says that these slow-growing countries lack &quot; dynamism , &quot; which he defines as a combination of entrepreneurial spirit and the financial institutions to channel it . 
Both spirit and the necessary financial institutions must be present to enable &quot; creative destruction &quot; - the force Joseph Schumpeter argued sixty years was the engine of capitalist prosperity - to be unleashed . 
But is this an accurate description of slow-growing countries ? 
It is often said that continental Europe and Japan lack the strong risk-taking tradition that exists in America or the UK . 
But it is actually difficult to see much of a difference in fundamental human values or preferences between these countries and the US . 
A decade ago , Maxim Boycko of Russia , Vladimir Korobov of Ukraine , and I conducted a study of economic attitudes towards capitalism , comparing the US , Russia , Ukraine , Japan , East Germany , and West Germany . 
While some variation in attitudes towards markets and enterprise did exist , the biggest differences were situational , rather than attitudinal : people in some countries had lower expectations of success and thought that government regulations would stymie their activities . 
This - the effects of government policies on incentives - rather than basic cultural differences or weak financial institutions , is at the root of the sluggish growth seen in some advanced economies . 
Indeed , financial institutions , at least in some of the countries surveyed , are now among the most advanced in the world . 
The irrational exuberance of the late 1990 &apos;s led to some setbacks in the development of new financial institutions . 
But only recently many slow growing countries were eager to develop venture capital markets and foster stock exchanges - France &apos;s Nouveau Marche , Germany &apos;s Neuer Markt , Italy &apos;s Nuovo Mercato , and Mothers in Japan - devoted to risky investments . 
These new stock exchanges , modeled on America &apos;s NASDAQ , ended up listing a lot of flimsy companies , and the collapse of share prices since 2000 caught them in the downdraft . 
The Neuer Markt no longer exists ; the others are weak , if not moribund . 
But setbacks in the process of improving risk-taking are to be expected ; it is important not to overreact to mistakes . 
Surely , the inadequacy of financial institutions is not what really retards the growth of these countries . 
So , what is the problem ? 
A number of books have appeared in Europe this fall about the causes of Europe &apos;s weak economies . 
Of these , Hans-Werner Sinn &apos;s Ist Deutschland noch zu retten ? 
( Can Germany Still Be Saved ? ) stands out for its cogent argument . 
Sinn argues that German sluggishness is largely the result of government-induced bad incentives - a problem that goes far beyond Germany &apos;s notoriously rigid labor market - and that , so far , Schröder &apos;s reforms do not go far enough to eliminate them . 
Sinn shows that the combined effects of the German tax and social welfare system virtually guarantee that no breadwinner in a family with two children can end up with less than € 1,500 a month , even without working at all . 
This rate is well above , for example , the wage of unskilled labor in the iron and steel industry . 
In effect , Germany is telling its unskilled not to bother working . 
The effects of the social welfare system are especially striking in Eastern Germany , where benefits are at Western German levels , despite lagging far behind in economic development . 
Sinn estimates that an East German family on welfare can collect four times the average income of a family in Poland and six times the income of a family in Hungary . 
With such a hurdle to hiring workers , no wonder industry is reluctant to locate in the East and the region is supported by subsidies equal to 45 % of its gross product . 
Because of these destructive incentives , Eastern Germany , Sinn argues , will remain a region of chronic unemployment , much like Italy &apos;s Mezzogiorno , which has been a drain on Italian finances for decades . 
Moreover , the draft European constitution will prohibit discrimination in social-welfare benefits against immigrants from other EU countries . 
If this provision is adopted , Sinn concludes , there will soon be &quot; twenty Mezzogiornos in Europe . &quot; 
Sinn &apos;s proposals - adjustments in tax rates and welfare benefits - are technical and would have no immediate or dramatic effect on people &apos;s behavior . 
In the longer run , a system of good incentives must be created to change people &apos;s expectations of economic success and increase their opportunities to &quot; learn by doing . &quot; 
Young people will better understand from their own experiences that taking responsibility for their economic lives pays off , that submitting to hard work and short-run risks is often wise and rewarding . 
Wherever this spirit takes root , financial sectors - and dynamic growth - will follow .
