A Future-Oriented US Fiscal Policy 
NEW YORK - At last , Republican candidates in the US presidential campaign have begun focusing on the economy . 
At a time of rising anxiety among middle-income voters about wealth inequality , and growing awareness of the unsustainability of Social Security and Medicare , this conversation could not be more important . 
In fact , tackling the problems with Social Security and Medicare is the key to addressing what ails the middle class . 
But fiscal-policy progressives , in particular , remain fixated on using higher tax rates on the wealthy to fund higher incomes for everyone else . 
Income redistribution may be an attractive idea for some - including , to a lesser extent , the Republicans who support a watered-down version , in which relatively high marginal tax rates support expanded family assistance - but it is fool &apos;s gold . 
As a recent Brookings Institution paper shows , higher marginal tax rates would do little to diminish income inequality in the US . 
Likewise , higher taxes cannot resolve the problem posed by the mounting unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare . 
Maintaining these programs in their current form would require growth-destroying tax increases on middle-income Americans , as well as continuing cuts in government funding for defense , education , and research . 
There is only one way to ensure broadly shared prosperity in the US : a future-oriented fiscal policy aimed at boosting employment and productivity , maintaining low marginal tax rates , strengthening support for workers , and investing in education , innovation , and infrastructure . 
The alternative - allowing the past , in the form of interest payments on the national debt and entitlement spending , to continue dictating fiscal policy - would block prosperity among middle-income households , by requiring continuous tax increases and reduced public investment . 
To fund this future-oriented policy , US leaders must implement reforms that enhance the long-run viability of the social safety net . 
As it stands , Social Security and Medicare are unsustainable , with the long-term gap between projected income and promised benefits reaching tens of trillions of dollars - well in excess of the official debt the federal government has accumulated over its history . 
Closing the gap with tax hikes - the burden of which would be borne largely by middle-income households - would threaten both economic growth and living standards . 
Health care and Social Security already consume half of the US federal budget , up from one-sixth in 1965 , and these outlays relative to GDP are projected to more than double by 2040 . 
With no change in course , the programs &quot; &quot; trust fund &quot; balances will be depleted by the 2030s . 
Avoiding that outcome will require US political leaders to constrain the growth of entitlement spending and bolster support for middle-income individuals . 
While Social Security and Medicare remain important to ensure wellbeing in retirement , their role must be updated to suit today &apos;s needs . 
For example , to ensure that no one who has worked for 30 or more years will live in poverty in old age , Social Security needs a higher minimum benefit for lower-income workers , with more affluent seniors seeing less growth in benefits over time . 
Adopting the chained consumer-price index for federal benefit calculations would ensure that benefits more accurately represent inflation , while slowing the rate of benefit growth for individuals . 
Beyond stabilizing Social Security &apos;s finances , US leaders should implement policies that place a higher value on work . 
Seniors working past the retirement age of 67 should not be subject to the payroll tax , and the retirement earnings test should be eliminated , so that seniors can work full-time without losing out on Social Security benefits . 
Finally , incentives for private retirement saving should be expanded . 
A similarly honest and modern approach can also secure Medicare , without large tax increases on middle-income Americans . 
For starters , bipartisan proposals for premium support , with seniors receiving subsidies to purchase private health insurance , should be implemented . 
To enable individuals to prepare to cover the associated deductibles and copayments , health savings accounts - funds which are not subject to income tax at the time of deposit , and can be used tax-free at any time to cover qualified medical expenses - should be expanded and strengthened . 
Premium support can significantly reduce Medicare spending , as it establishes a framework for more efficient spending on benefits , driven by competition and innovation in care and coverage . 
So far , the only US presidential candidate who has recognized the need for such a future-oriented approach is former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , who has proposed modernizing reforms of Social Security and Medicare that avoid imposing high costs on middle-income Americans and a heavier debt burden on future generations . 
Two other Republican candidates , Ohio Governor John Kasich and Florida Senator Marco Rubio , have also raised constructive reform ideas . 
By contrast , former Secretary of State and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and a leading Republican contender , Donald Trump , have opposed reform of Social Security and Medicare . 
Senator Bernie Sanders , Clinton &apos;s Democratic rival , actually proposes to expand the programs &quot; unfunded liabilities . 
With so few presidential candidates recognizing the link between reforming Social Security and Medicare and ensuring broadly shared prosperity , the US faces serious risks . 
The progressive redistributive agenda could continue to advance , or the conservative entitlement-reform agenda could fail . 
Either way , the US would face growth-limiting tax increases and limits on the contributions that public investment can make to the country &apos;s future . 
There is a fiscal path to enhancing prosperity for middle-income Americans . 
It requires support for growth , rewards for work , investment in opportunity , and , unavoidably , reforms to Social Security and Medicare . 
One hopes that , as the campaign progresses , honest and forward-looking fiscal-policy debates recognizing this fundamental truth gain traction .
