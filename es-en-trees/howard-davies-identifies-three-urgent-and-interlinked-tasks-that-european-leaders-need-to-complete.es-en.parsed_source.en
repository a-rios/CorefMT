Looking Beyond Juncker 
LONDON - The European Union appears to be capable of concentrating on only one problem at a time . 
This summer it is the question of who will succeed Jos√©-Manuel Barroso as President of the European Commission . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron has found himself fighting a rearguard action to try to block the appointment of the arch-federalist Luxembourger Jean-Claude Juncker . 
The Commission presidency is no doubt an important job . 
The Commission retains a monopoly on proposing new legislation , the character of which is heavily influenced by the president . 
But new legislation is something of a luxury for Europe these days . 
Rather than contemplating exciting new directives on the desirable characteristics of , say , lawnmowers sold in the EU , Europe &apos;s leaders must complete three urgent and interlinked tasks . 
The first is political . 
In the recent European Parliament election , a quarter of voters in the United Kingdom and France backed parties that are hostile to further integration and committed to restoring a Europe of independent member states . 
Even in Germany , a euroskeptic party did surprisingly well . 
The center-left and center-right federalists have responded by making common cause to secure a majority for Juncker . 
That is not a stable outcome . 
Defenders of the European ideal need to engage more directly with its critics and articulate an inspiring vision , rather than sticking their heads in the sand and intoning the words &quot; ever closer union &quot; at every opportunity . 
They would find it easier to win over euroskeptics if they could point to more solid and durable economic achievements . 
Eurozone growth remains sluggish , at 0.7 % over the last year , while unemployment , at 11.7 % , is unacceptably high . 
These averages are depressing enough , but some parts of the continent are in far worse shape . 
Spanish unemployment is above 25 % , and the Italian economy has barely grown since the euro &apos;s introduction . 
Economic recovery is being held back by financial problems - the third hot topic that EU leaders must address . 
The single financial market broke down four years ago and has not yet been repaired . 
To be sure , the European Central Bank has done what it takes to narrow the borrowing cost differences between European sovereigns . 
For much of 2012 and 2013 , the Spanish and Italian governments were paying 5.5-7 % for ten-year money , while the German rate was below 2 % . 
Today , the differential is much lower . 
Spain and Italy are paying only around 150 basis points more than Germany . 
ECB President Mario Draghi can take credit for that . 
But from businesses &quot; perspective , things look rather different . 
For a Spanish or Italian small firm , the interest-rate differential remains as high as it was . 
An unsecured business loan will cost a Southern European firm two percentage points more than its counterpart on the Rhine , even though the two companies have a similar credit rating . 
Until 2010 , the gap was just a few basis points . 
It exploded in 2011 and has not narrowed since . 
That is a serious competitive disadvantage to add to the penalty of being at a greater distance from the EU &apos;s center of economic gravity . 
If it persists , it will reinforce the growing division of Europe into &quot; haves &quot; and &quot; have-nots . &quot; 
How can such a differential persist in what is supposed to be a single , integrated financial market ? 
The answer , of course , is that the eurozone is no such thing , at least not yet . 
The crisis of confidence in the EU banking sector that erupted in 2010 has not yet been resolved . 
European banks are still reluctant to lend to one another , especially across borders . 
They suspect that some of their counterparts are weak and vulnerable , and have little confidence in the willingness of national bank supervisors to reveal the truth and demand remediation . 
So German banks with surplus cash would rather deposit it at the ECB than put it to work in Italy or Greece . 
The banking union was agreed in order to correct that problem , with the ECB front and center as the single supervisor of all major European banks . 
But the market is clearly signaling that the banking union has not yet done its job - indeed , that it is by no means complete . 
There are doubts about the lack of a unified deposit-protection scheme , about the availability of funds to resolve a failing institution , and about whether the ECB &apos;s approach will be rigorous enough to identify the lame ducks , force them to recapitalize , and thus rebuild confidence . 
The key test will come this autumn , when the ECB reveals the results of its asset quality review . 
I expect the supervisors to be rigorous : their institution &apos;s credibility depends on it . 
But national supervisors and governments retain a significant role . 
Will they be prepared to be honest and , more important , willing and able to help the walking wounded raise capital ? 
Recent debt issues by the Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena and others have shown that financing for banks is expensive . 
Investors need to be offered heavy discounts to persuade them to part with their money . 
As a result , some banks that suspect that their balance sheets will be revealed to be weaker than they have so far acknowledged are cutting back on lending . 
The continuing credit constraints are one reason that parts of the European economy remain weak . 
So the three problems that Europe will face in the second half of this year are closely connected . 
The EU will need the strongest leadership team that it can find to steer through treacherous waters and implement crucial financial reforms . 
Just now , the signs are far from promising . 
There are few new faces or ideas on the horizon . 
We must hope to be surprised .
