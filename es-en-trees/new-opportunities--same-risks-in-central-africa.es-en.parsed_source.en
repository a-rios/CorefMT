New Opportunities , Same Risks in Central Africa 
LONDON - Central Africa has lately been attracting some unfamiliar attention . 
Discoveries of large mineral deposits and other opportunities have brought a chance to diversify investment beyond the dominant oil sectors of Equatorial Guinea and Gabon . 
Cameroon is expected to attract $ 10 billion over the next few years to develop some of the most promising new mineral reserves in the region , while Equatorial Guinea is pushing infrastructure development . 
Elsewhere , BHP Billiton announced the discovery of an estimated 60 million tons of manganese in southeastern Gabon , while France &apos;s AREVA is drawing up plans to build a large mine in the Central African Republic to exploit uranium deposits . 
But &quot; natural resources &quot; and &quot; Africa &quot; is a combination that usually triggers alarm bells , and Central Africa is no exception . 
There are significant political risks related to the overlapping political and business interests of the region &apos;s entrenched ruling elites , presenting headaches for investors concerned about their reputations . 
Corruption is rampant , and most companies are often forced to work with government-picked partners , over whom control is severely limited . 
A United States Senate report released in February revealed flagrant abuse of state funds in Equatorial Guinea . 
The son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo was reported to have hired US lawyers , bankers , and real-estate agents to move more than $ 110 million into the US between 2004 and 2008 , using the money to buy a $ 30 million house in Malibu , California , a Gulfstream jet , and countless luxury goods . 
He is now the subject of a criminal investigation and faces charges of money laundering , bribery , and extortion . 
The report mentions other ruling dynasties in the region , including Gabon &apos;s Bongo clan , which is also accused of abusing public funds . 
Political risk and security of tenure present further obstacles to investors . 
Political interference in the private sector throughout the region means that most large business projects are carried out as joint-ventures with state-controlled companies ( sometimes covertly headed by members of the ruling elites ) . 
This often implies illicit payments to obtain contracts or licenses outside official tender processes . 
When regimes change , such contracts could come up for review , as has occurred in many other African countries . 
Such changes have been fairly rare in a region long dominated by &quot; big men &quot; such as Omar Bongo , Obiang , and Cameroon &apos;s President Paul Biya . 
However , Biya &apos;s advanced age raises serious questions about the potential fallout from a political transition and what such a transition might mean for existing contracts . 
But there are some hopeful signs . 
The Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa ( CEMAC ) recently named Equatorial Guinea &apos;s Lucas Abaga Nchama to head its central bank , the Bank of Central African States ( BEAC ) . 
He becomes the first non-Gabonese national to hold the post since the bank was set up in 1972 . 
Leading positions at both CEMAC and the BEAC will now rotate among the six members - Cameroon , Chad , Gabon , Equatorial Guinea , the Central African Republic , and the Republic of Congo - potentially heralding greater regional integration . 
The position fell vacant after senior officials , many of them Gabonese , were discredited in an embezzlement scandal that erupted in October 2009 . 
Major fraud at the Paris office cost the bank around $ 28 million , showing the weakness of audit and control mechanisms . 
Nchama &apos;s appointment represents a clear break with the past , and he claims he will be the man to shake things up . 
But it remains questionable whether the region &apos;s new faces can end the old patterns of mismanagement and abuse . 
A cleanup is needed to restore credibility , but prospects for comprehensive reform remain limited , given the history of poor accounting and transparency standards in most member states . 
Nchama &apos;s appointment was a success for Equatorial Guinea in its long quest to boost its influence in CEMAC . 
The country has plowed some of its oil money into increasing its contributions to the BEAC , and now reportedly provides 48 % of CEMAC &apos;s foreign-currency reserves . 
The strategy appears to have paid off . 
Given the Obiang clan &apos;s implication in serious corruption and misuse of state funds , however , it hardly bodes well for regional reform . 
With the possible exception of Gabon - where it is too early to assess the effectiveness of reforms proposed by the new president - most CEMAC governments are run by insular ruling elites that engage more in democratic window-dressing than in genuine political and economic liberalization . 
This style of governance provides ideal conditions for abuse of public office , which has led to endemic corruption . 
As is true so often across the continent , the watchword for would-be investors Central Africa &apos;s resource boom should be caveat emptor .
