The Palestine Follies 
American foreign policy in the Middle East experienced yet another major setback this month , when Hamas , whose Palestinian government the United States had tried to isolate , routed the rival Fatah movement in Gaza . 
In response , Israel sealed Gaza &apos;s borders , making life even more unbearable in a place wracked by violence , poverty , and despair . 
It is important that we recognize the source of America &apos;s failure , because it keeps recurring , making peace between Israel and Palestine more difficult . 
The roots of failure lie in the US and Israeli governments &quot; belief that military force and financial repression can lead to peace on their terms , rather than accepting a compromise on terms that the Middle East , the rest of the world , and , crucially , most Israelis and Palestinians , accepted long ago . 
For 40 years , since the Six-Day War of 1967 , there has been one realistic possibility for peace : Israel &apos;s return to its pre-1967 borders , combined with viable economic conditions for a Palestinian state , including access to trade routes , water supplies , and other essential needs . 
With small and mutually acceptable adjustments to those borders , these terms would enable peaceful co-existence of two states side by side . 
Perhaps three-fourths of both Israelis and Palestinians support this &quot; land for peace &quot; compromise , while one-fourth holds out for complete victory over the other side . 
Rejectionists on both sides repeatedly undermined efforts to realize that compromise . 
Starting in the early 1970 &quot; s , religious Israeli settlers and hard-line Israeli nationalists pushed Israel into a disastrous policy of creating and expanding settlements on Arab lands in the West Bank , in violation of common sense and international diplomacy . 
That policy blocked peace ever since , setting the stage for decades of bloodshed . 
Nor have extremists on either side shrunk from political murder . 
Islamic militants killed Anwar Sadat , the Egyptian peacemaker , while a Jewish militant killed Yitzhak Rabin , the would-be Israeli peacemaker . 
Violent extremists on both sides have ratcheted up their actions whenever the majority succeeded in getting closer to peace . 
For the past ten years , the greatest practical barrier to peace has been Israel &apos;s failure to carry out any true withdrawal to its 1967 borders , owing to the political weight of hundreds of thousands of settlers in the West Bank and the religious and secular communities that support them . 
This remains the crucial truth ; the rest follows as tragedy . 
Even when the US or Israel have tabled peace offers , such as at Camp David in 2000 , they have included convoluted ways to sustain the West Bank settlements and large settler populations , while denying an economically viable and contiguous Palestinian state . 
The most recent debacle began when President George W. Bush called for Palestinian democracy in 2004 , but then refused to honor the democratic process . 
Hamas , a radical movement , won the Palestinian election in January 2006 , but not before blatant pre-election meddling by the US in favor of Fatah , which merely helped to boost Hamas &apos;s legitimacy . 
Then , after Hamas won , the US and Israel immediately orchestrated a cutoff of finances to the newly elected government , including even Israel &apos;s transfer of Palestine &apos;s own customs revenues , which Israel collects as the occupying authority in control of the borders . 
Rather than act pragmatically , and deal with Hamas in government on the basis of its actions vis-Ã -vis Israel , the US and Israel demanded from the outset that Hamas recognize Israel &apos;s right to exist as a precondition for continued financial flows . 
The US and Israel believed that they could force Hamas into submission even before negotiations with the new government began . 
This is the hubris of believing that brute force and threats , rather than actual negotiation , can yield solutions . 
The result was predictable , despite US and Israel expressions of shock at recent developments . 
US and Israeli pressure deeply compromised Palestinians &quot; access to water , food , medicines , and physical safety , especially in overcrowded Gaza . 
Although Israel formally withdrew from Gaza , its complete control over the borders , infrastructure , transport , and taxation , together with its regular military incursions in response to shelling from Gaza and its killings and capture of senior Hamas officials , left Palestinians there desperate . 
In this mix , violence escalated . 
Hamas did not fold in negotiations . 
Instead , conflict broke out between Hamas and Fatah , leading to Fatah &apos;s collapse and desperate flight from Gaza . 
In a near-parody of external interventions , the US and Israel encouraged President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah to dismiss the Hamas-led government , and to declare a new Fatah-led government in the West Bank . 
Gaza is now under Hamas control , and the West Bank is perhaps under nobody &apos;s control . 
Israel has said that it will squeeze Gaza still further , as if the population can be crushed into submission . 
But there are far too many weapons and young men prepared to die for that to occur . 
There is , alas , still only one settlement possible , based on true compromise , not unilateral imposition . 
No amount of machinations by outside powers or internal forces will impose a settlement . 
Israel and Palestine will have to reach an agreement based on the fact that they share a small and contested space . 
The problem is that hatred and demographic changes are making , many people believe , even the two-state solution impossible . 
A few hope for a single secular democratic state . 
But many more have lost all hope . 
My view is that a two-state solution of peace and mutual respect remains possible , but perhaps for not much longer .
