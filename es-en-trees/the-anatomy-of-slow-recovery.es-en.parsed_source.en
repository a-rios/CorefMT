The Anatomy of Slow Recovery 
BERKELEY - Between 1950 and 1990 - the days of old-fashioned inflation-fighting downturns engineered by the United States Federal Reserve - America &apos;s post-recession unemployment rate would fall on average 32.4 % over the course of a year from its initial value toward its natural rate . 
If the US unemployment rate had started to follow such a path after peaking in the second half of 2009 , it would now stand at 8.3 % , rather than 8.9 % . 
Unfortunately , none of the net reduction in the US unemployment rate over the past year came from increases in the employment-to-population ratio ; all of it came from declining labor-force participation . 
Unemployment has fallen from 10.1 % over the course of the past 18 months , but the employment-to-population ratio has remained stuck at 58.4 % . 
Perhaps it would be better if unemployed people who could have jobs - and who at full employment would have them - were actively looking for work rather than out of the labor force completely . 
If you take that view , between 1950 and 1990 , the US employment-to-population ratio would rise an extra 0.227 % annually on average for each year that the unemployment rate was above its natural rate . 
If the US employment-to-population ratio had started to follow such a path after its 2009 peak , the current ratio would be 59.7 % , rather than 58.4 % . 
( In that case , we would be experiencing &quot; morning in America , &quot; rather than the current state of economic malaise . ) 
This is , I think , the best metric to use to quantify the decidedly sub-par pace of today &apos;s jobless recovery in the US . 
Indeed , today &apos;s US predicament contrasts sharply only with the current experiences of developing Asia . 
There , real GDP growth and declining unemployment show a solid , well-entrenched , and rapid recovery - to the point that inflation will soon become a more significant macroeconomic problem than job creation . 
The obvious hypothesis to explain why the current US recovery - like the previous two - has proceeded at a sub-par pace is that the speed of any recovery is linked to what caused the downturn . 
A pre-1990 recession was triggered by a Fed decision to switch policy from business-as-usual to inflation-fighting . 
The Fed would then cause a liquidity squeeze and so distort asset prices as to make much construction , sizable amounts of other investment , and some consumption goods unaffordable ( and thus unprofitable to produce ) . 
The resulting excess supply of goods , services , and labor would cause inflation to fall . 
As soon as the Fed had achieved its inflation-fighting goal , however , it would end the liquidity squeeze . 
Asset prices and incomes would return to normal . 
And all the lines of business that had been profitable before the downturn would become profitable once again . 
From an entrepreneurial standpoint , therefore , recovery was a straightforward matter : simply pick up where you left off and do what you used to do . 
After the most recent US downturn , however ( and to a lesser extent after its two predecessors ) , things have been different . 
And that means that the entrepreneurial problems of are much more complex , for recovery is not a matter of reviving what used to be profitable to produce , but rather of figuring out what will be profitable to produce in the future . 
As the economist Dan Kuehn likes to say , a recession is like somebody knocking your jigsaw puzzle , disturbing the pieces , and turning some of them over . 
When the Fed ends a liquidity squeeze , it turns the pieces right side up . So it is easy to reassemble the puzzle . 
Indeed , I believe that things are even worse : as long as aggregate demand remains low , we cannot even tell which pieces are right side up . 
New investments , lines of business , and worker-firm matches that would be highly productive and profitable at normal levels of capacity utilization and unemployment are unprofitable now . 
So , what America needs now is not just a recovery in demand , but also structural adjustment . 
Unfortunately , the market cannot produce a demand recovery rapidly by itself .
