Trapped in Euroland 
TOKYO - The eurozone is sometimes dubbed &quot; Euroland &quot; by Americans ( and some Asians ) . Given its echoes of &quot; Disneyland , &quot; a place of fantasy , that is a far more mocking than useful nickname . 
Ever since the euro was first proposed , skeptics ( mostly American ) and believers ( mostly European ) have fiercely debated the economic preconditions for the single currency , its benefits for members , and its political feasibility . 
Asian economists who promote regional integration in Asia have observed the debate with amazement , in that the fault line is not based on economic philosophy like &quot; Keynesians vs. Neoclassicals &quot; or &quot; Liberals vs. Conservatives , &quot; but on a geographical , transatlantic divide . 
American economists , led by Martin Feldstein , have argued that the eurozone &apos;s economies are too diverse , with too many institutional differences and labor-market rigidities , to form an optimal currency area . 
Moreover , a common monetary policy combined with independent fiscal policy is bound to fail : the former increases unemployment in weaker economies because the interest rate reflects average eurozone indicators ( with large weights on Germany and France ) , but keeps borrowing costs low enough that weak economies &quot; governments can finance fiscal profligacy . 
European believers insist that the single currency is really founded on the strong political will to secure eternal peace in Europe . 
Even if the eurozone might not satisfy the necessary economic preconditions at the outset , economic variables would converge later on . 
Middle-income , low-price / wage countries would grow faster with a higher inflation rate . 
The Growth and Stability Pact would safeguard fiscal discipline . 
During the eurozone &apos;s first , prosperous decade , European believers seemed to have won the debate . 
Eurozone countries grew at a reasonably high rate , per-capita income and price levels converged , and interest-rate spreads narrowed , with only occasional minor turmoil in the markets . 
Several countries successfully joined the eurozone after fiscal and monetary reforms . 
More are waiting to do so . 
The euro has become the second key currency in international finance . 
Asians have watched the formerly triumphant euro &apos;s Greek crisis with a muted sense of vindication . 
Back in 1997 , many Asians thought that the speculative attacks then being mounted on Asian currencies were unjustified , with Malaysia &apos;s Prime Minister Mohamad Mahathir leading the charge against speculators . 
In response to the crisis , Asians sought to establish an Asian Monetary Fund , which would help any crisis-hit country by providing massive liquidity assistance . 
The very announcement of the Fund &apos;s creation was meant to deter speculative attack . 
Now the Europeans are setting up a European Monetary Fund - a nickname that Europeans may oppose - in cooperation with the IMF . 
But announcing an IMF program ( with regional bilateral assistance ) was not what calmed markets in South Korea and Indonesia in 1997 . 
In the end , South Korea was saved by coordinated forced rollovers of foreign banks &quot; lending ( why not try that in Greece ? ) , and Indonesia experienced financial meltdown , because the country could not fulfill much of the IMF &apos;s conditionality . 
( The new , gentler IMF has sworn off such harsh conditionality for Greece . ) 
Two differences between the Asia crisis of 1997 and today &apos;s Greek crisis stand out . 
One concerns who borrowed the money . 
In Greece , the problem is with sovereign deficits ( much of it long concealed ) , while the problem in Asia was unmonitored private-sector debt . 
The second difference concerns the exchange-rate regime . 
The US , the IMF , and others had encouraged Asian countries to increase exchange-rate flexibility . 
The depreciation that followed the crisis helped accelerate recovery by boosting exports . 
Indeed , given that depreciation is a key tool for engineering a fast economic recovery , why not invite Greece to leave the eurozone ? 
After all , by staying in the euro , a rapid export-led recovery would be impossible . 
The only other way to achieve depreciation in real terms is through massive deflation of domestic prices , coupled with a severe recession . 
Moreover , all of Greece &apos;s structural problems - a thin tax base , large numbers of government employees who receive bonus payments , and generous pension benefits - cannot be sustained within the eurozone . 
But solving any of them will be extremely hard , and if these problems are not resolved in Greece and other troubled eurozone members , these other countries will follow the same path . 
Even the European Monetary Fund may not be enough to save the day then , because those now on the side of the rescuers would become those in need of rescue . 
Any financial crisis looks like a liquidity crisis for those who are stuck in the middle of it - or anywhere nearby . 
The same crisis looks like a solvency crisis for those who are geographically distant . 
And crises are repeated in different regions , triggered by strikingly similar economic and financial mechanisms , though the details of course differ . As Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff have written , everyone near a financial crisis thinks &quot; This time is different . &quot; 
But the evolution of the Greek crisis is different from the Asian crisis . 
Europeans now have a regional monetary fund , which Asians wanted but could not have . 
The political will to protect the euro is strong - perhaps strong enough to override moral-hazard concerns . 
To keep the eurozone intact , regardless of the cost , became Europe &apos;s only viable option once the single currency was adopted . 
So , as &quot; euroland &quot; risks breaking up over the Greek crisis , musically-versed economists recall the cryptic last line of that 1970 &quot; s pop song &quot; Hotel California &quot; by the Eagles : &quot; You can check out any time you like , but you can never leave . &quot; 
That line resonates as Germany and Greece contemplate their shared fate . 
Their worries are an object lesson for those Asians who are still contemplating deeper economic integration in the form of a shared currency .
