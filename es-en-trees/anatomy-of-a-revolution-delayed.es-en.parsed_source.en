Anatomy of a Revolution Delayed 
The ongoing conflict between Iran &apos;s rulers and the Iranian public is the result of a head-on collision between two contradictory forces . 
In recent years , public attitudes in Iran have become more liberal . 
At the same time , power has shifted from conservative pragmatism toward a much more militant fundamentalism . The call by the most important group of Iran &apos;s clerics for the election results to be thrown out is but the latest sign of the fight back of both the reformist and pragmatic conservative factions . 
Thirty years after the Islamic revolution , Iranians are growing demonstrably less religious and more liberal . 
Two face-to-face surveys of more than 2,500 Iranian adults , conducted in 2000 and 2005 , clearly show the trend . 
The percentage of those who &quot; strongly agree &quot; that democracy is the best form of government increased from 20 % to 31 % . 
Similarly , on a number of questions concerning gender equality - including political leadership , equal access to higher education , and wifely obedience - the numbers continued a downward trend . 
Those who considered love as the basis for marriage increased from 49 % to 69 % , while those who depended on parental approval fell from 41 % to 24 % . 
In 2005 , a much higher percentage than in 2000 defined themselves as &quot; Iranian , above all &quot; rather than &quot; Muslim , above all . &quot; 
This trend is not hard to understand . 
The imposition of a monolithic religious discourse on society has made liberal values attractive to Iranians . 
But , while this was reflected in reformist trends in the country &apos;s wider political life , a movement toward militant fundamentalism took shape within the regime &apos;s power structure . 
Reform-minded politicians were partly to blame for this change . 
Far from opposing absolutist power as an impediment to religious democracy , they tried to persuade the Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , of the value of reform . 
But Khamenei had no interest in reform , as he made plain in dismantling the reform movement . 
The presidency of Mohammad Khatami , an avowed reformer , who served eight years , beginning in 1997 , convinced the Supreme Leader that his authority would be assured only if the presidency was held by a subservient fundamentalist such as the current president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 
In this , Khamenei was following the lead of the late Shah , who kept Amir Abbas Hoveyda , a loyal retainer , as prime minister from 1965 until the Shah was overthrown in 1979 . 
The problem with the Supreme Leader &apos;s calculation , however , is that Ahmadinejad is a loose cannon . 
His populist rhetoric and religious fundamentalism have alienated a large section of conservative-pragmatist clerics and their supporters . 
Many members of this group honor the institution of private property , and Ahmadinejad &apos;s talk of redistributing wealth is not to their liking . 
More disturbing to them is his apocalyptic conviction regarding the imminent advent of the Hidden Imam , the Mahdi , whose appearance is believed to lead to the destruction of the world and the end of time . 
Generally , Ahmadinejad begins his public speeches with prayers for the Mahdi &apos;s immediate return . 
For the Shia religious hierarchy , long accustomed to relegating the advent of the Mahdi to a distant future , Ahmadinejad &apos;s insistent millenarianism is troublesome . 
They have often dismissed as unorthodox , if not heretical , any claim of personal contact with the Imam or speculation about his arrival . 
Several ayatollahs opined that such talk about the Mahdi is unbecoming of a president or , worse , indicative of an unstable leader . 
These concerns were reflected in the fact that the Society of Combatant Clergy , a conservative body , was unable to endorse Ahmadinejad &apos;s candidacy . 
Defiance of the Supreme Leader by millions of Iranians just a day after he firmly endorsed Ahmadinejad threw the country into a political crisis . 
Worldwide broadcasts of the beating and killing of protesters have undermined the regime &apos;s religious credentials . 
Seeking a way out of this difficult situation , the Supreme Leader declared that the electoral disputes must be settled in through legal channels , not on the street . 
Given his role in justifying electoral fraud , this argument seems like an effort to buy time to clear the streets of demonstrators , put opposition leaders under severe physical and psychological stress , and isolate Mir Hossein Mousavi , the presumed winner of the real vote . 
Nonetheless , Khamenei &apos;s invocation of the law echoes the demands of many conservative-pragmatists who lean toward Mousavi , who is not in a position to challenge Khamenei &apos;s authority directly . 
Mousavi must carefully continue his legal campaign , without compromising the trust he has gained from the majority of Iranians . 
He must stand by his two principal demands : nullification of the election and establishment of an impartial committee to rule on the government &apos;s violations of the electoral law . 
Should Mousavi persuade Khamenei to reconsider his position , the Supreme Leader &apos;s hold on power will be shaken . 
If Khamenei holds fast , Mousavi cannot gain the presidency , but he will continue to represent the hopes of the majority of Iranians who differ dramatically with their government . 
For now , what will happen depends on Mousavi &apos;s perseverance .
