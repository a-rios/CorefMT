Russia &apos;s Potemkin Olympic Village 
MOSCOW - Remember the year 2007 ? 
Russia was starting to look like a world power again . 
Its economy was growing at a record 8.5 % annual rate . 
Political life had stabilized . 
Support for President Vladimir Putin was stratospheric . 
The decade-long Chechen rebellion seemed to have been suppressed . 
And , to top it off , the International Olympic Committee awarded the 2014 Winter Games to Russia &apos;s Black Sea resort , Sochi . 
In many respects , it was a strange choice of venue : sunny Sochi has beautiful mountains but little or no snow . 
It is also 850 miles south of Moscow , with few direct flights from Europe , while the trip from the United States can involve up to four legs . 
But in 2007 , Russians were becoming more optimistic about their future . 
Addressing the Olympic Committee , Putin argued that awarding Russia the Games would not only allow it to showcase its post-Soviet achievements ; it would also help the country through its political and economic transition . 
Nothing seemed too difficult for Putin , even mouthing unnecessary democratic platitudes for an Olympic committee whose members had already awarded the 2008 Summer Olympics to Beijing . 
But , once construction got underway , the realities of modern Russia could not be so easily hidden . 
The colossal project , which cost more than $ 50 billion - more than all previous Winter Olympics combined - was expected to turn Sochi into a sporting paradise , packed with arenas and a new airport . 
Instead , corruption and construction accidents have plagued preparations , with hotels still unfinished just days before the opening ceremony . 
Delay and waste are common in Olympic preparations ( Greece in 2004 is an obvious example , and Brazil in 2016 appears to be experiencing similar problems ) . 
But Russia is proving to be an unsuitable host for other reasons . 
For starters , there are concerns about Putin &apos;s own political legitimacy . 
His controversial and unconstitutional re-election to a third presidential term was condemned internationally and triggered anti-government protests across Russia . 
Putin responded to those he considers political enemies by arresting and jailing protesters , including the all-girl rock band Pussy Riot , following &quot; show trials &quot; ( with the Olympics approaching , there have been recent &quot; show pardons &quot; ) . 
Such episodes have contributed to a general air of intolerance across Russia , fueled in no small part by Kremlin-incited chauvinism . 
A government sponsored anti-gay propaganda law , which indiscriminately criminalizes same-sex couples , has caused outrage abroad . 
Local activists have even advised gay athletes not to display signs of their sexual orientation while in Russia . 
Similarly , though the Olympics should be an occasion for national pride , foreign - and in particular American - athletes have been told to avoid showing their team colors when outside the grounds . 
In fact , they have been warned not to wander beyond Sochi &apos;s &quot; ring of steel &quot; security perimeter and the watchful gaze of black-and-gray-clad police officers , even though Olympians typically like to explore local sights . 
None of this engenders a sense of Olympic solidarity and international friendship . 
And it gets worse . 
The authorities must also contend with threats from Islamist insurgents from Chechnya , who are now operating in other North Caucasian republics , a mere 200 miles from Sochi . 
The &quot; black widows &quot; - wives of Islamist fighters killed in the Kremlin &apos;s &quot; pacification &quot; campaign - are believed to be preparing retaliatory suicide missions at airports , train stations , and on buses . 
The last time Russia hosted the Olympics - the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow - the US and its allies staged a boycott in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . 
And yet the Soviet Union was a superpower , stagnant but stable . 
Its totalitarian secrecy , gargantuan military-industrial complex , ever-present KGB handlers , and apparent disdain for material comforts ( at least for ordinary Russians ) gave the Communist hegemon a perverse mystique that made even a simple visit to Red Square a trip to remember . 
However much the country was hated or feared , one could not deny that is was a major player on the world stage . 
Not so today . 
Putin &apos;s Russia is weak , tawdry , and corrupt - and underserving as an Olympic host . 
The atmosphere surrounding the Sochi Games reflects many of Russia &apos;s worst traits . 
In the immortal words of former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , describing the country &apos;s economic transition of the 1990 &quot; s : &quot; We hoped for the best , but things turned out as usual . &quot; 
Even assuming that the Sochi Games pass off successfully , and that , despite the security restrictions and official bigotry , athletes and visitors enjoy their stay , will Russia &apos;s brief display of national pride really be worth the financial and political cost ? 
Or will Russians wake up six months from now and say , &quot; Yes , our country has a fancy ski resort - at the beach . &quot;
