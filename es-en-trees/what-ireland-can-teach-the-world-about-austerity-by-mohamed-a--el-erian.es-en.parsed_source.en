Ireland and the Austerity Debate 
DUBLIN - Both sides of the austerity debate that is now gripping economists and policymakers cite Ireland &apos;s experience as evidence for their case . 
And , however much they try to position the country as a poster-child , neither side is able to convince the other . 
Yet this tug-of-war is important , because it illustrates the complex range of arguments that are in play . 
It also demonstrates why more conclusive economic policy making is proving so elusive . 
Here is a quick reminder of Ireland &apos;s sad recent economic history . 
Lulled into complacency and excess by ample supplies of artificially cheap financing , Irish banks went on a lending binge . 
Irresponsible risk-taking and excessive greed outpaced prudential regulation and supervision . 
The banking system ended up fueling massive speculation , including a huge run-up in real-estate prices , only to be brought to its knees when the bubbles popped . 
Unlike the many Irish households that lost jobs and part of their wealth , the banks were deemed to be &quot; too big to fail , &quot; so Ireland &apos;s political elites intervened with state funding . 
But , by under-estimating both the domestic and international aspects of the problem , the authorities transformed a banking problem into a national tragedy . 
Rather than restoring the banks to financial health and ensuring responsible behavior , the Irish economy as a whole was dragged down . 
Growth collapsed ; unemployment spiked . 
Lacking opportunities , emigration increased - a vivid reminder of how economic crises have wreaked havoc on the country &apos;s demographics throughout its history . 
Investors withdrew in droves from what was once deemed the &quot; Celtic Tiger . &quot; 
The government had no choice but to request a bailout from the &quot; troika &quot; - the International Monetary Fund , the European Central Bank , and the European Commission - thereby transferring an important component of national economic governance to an ad hoc , fragile , and sometimes feuding group of institutions . 
While other struggling eurozone members also turned to the troika , Ireland stands out in at least two notable ways . 
First , two democratically-elected governments have steadfastly implemented the agreed austerity programs with little need for waivers and modifications - and thus without the associated political drama . 
Second , despite enduring considerable pain , Irish society has stuck with the program , staging few of the street protests that have been common in other austerity-hit countries . 
All of this puts Ireland in the middle of three important issues raised in the austerity debates : whether orthodox policy , with its heavy emphasis on immediate budget cuts , can restore conditions for growth , employment gains , and financial stability ; whether the benefits of eurozone membership still outweigh the costs for countries that must restructure their economies ; and how a small , open economy should strategically position itself in today &apos;s world . 
Austerity &apos;s supporters point to the fact that Ireland is on the verge of &quot; graduating &quot; from the troika &apos;s program . 
Growth has resumed , financial-risk premia have fallen sharply , foreign investment is picking up , and exports are booming . 
All of this , they argue , provides the basis for sustainable growth and declining unemployment . 
Ireland , they conclude , was right to stay in the eurozone , especially because small , open economies that are unanchored can be easily buffeted by a fluid global economy . 
&quot; Not so fast , &quot; says the other side . 
The critics of austerity point to the fact that Irish GDP has still not returned to its 2007 level . 
Unemployment remains far too high , with alarming levels of long-term and youth joblessness . 
Public debt remains too high as well , and , making matters worse , much more of it is now owed to official rather than private creditors ( which would complicate debt restructuring should it become necessary ) . 
The critics reject the argument that small , open economies are necessarily better off in a monetary union , pointing to how well Switzerland is coping . 
And they lament that eurozone membership means that Ireland &apos;s &quot; internal devaluations , &quot; which involve significant cuts in real wages , have not yet run their course . 
The data on the &quot; Irish experiment &quot; - including the lack of solid counterfactuals - are not conclusive enough for one side to declare a decisive victory . 
Yet there is some good analytical news . 
Ireland provides insights that are helpful in understanding how sociopolitical systems , including economically devastated countries like Cyprus and Greece , have coped so far with shocks that were essentially unthinkable just a few years ago . 
On my current visit , most of the Irish citizens with whom I have spoken say that the country had no alternative but to follow the path of austerity . 
While they appreciate the urgent need for growth and jobs , they believe that this can be achieved only after Ireland &apos;s finances are put back on a sound footing . 
They also argue that , given the banks &quot; irresponsibility , there is no quick way to promote sustained expansion . 
They are still angry at bankers , but have yet to gain proper retribution . 
Ireland &apos;s accumulation of wealth during its Celtic Tiger period , when the country surged toward the top of Europe &apos;s economic league table , has also been an effective shock absorber . 
This , together with fears about being left out in the geopolitical cold ( despite the country &apos;s historical links with Britain and America ) , dampens Irish enthusiasm for economic experiments outside the eurozone . 
Indeed , Irish society seems remarkably hesitant to change course . 
Right or wrong , Ireland will stick with austerity . 
Efforts to regain national control of the country &apos;s destiny , the Irish seem to believe , must take time . 
In some of Europe &apos;s other struggling countries , however , citizens may well prove less patient .
