Bolivia \ u0027s Populist Temptation 
In April 2002 , violent demonstrations known as the &quot; water war &quot; in Bolivia forced President Hugo B치nzer to cancel the contract with the only international corporation interested in taking on the most ambitious water project ever proposed in the country . 
Recently , another major popular upheaval ended a project to export natural gas to Mexico and the United States through a Chilean seaport . 
This was the &quot; gas war , &quot; which its leaders used to overthrow President S치nchez de Lozada and hold back the modernization process of strengthening institutions , opening markets , and integrating Bolivia into the global economy . 
These so-called &quot; wars &quot; are part of the same conflict that prompted the peasant blockades of September 2000 , the continuing protests by coca growers against efforts to eradicate their crops because of their role in the cocaine trade , and the withdrawal earlier this year of a progressive tax project . 
In essence , these are all part of an ongoing conflict between democracy and populism , with Bolivia &apos;s future caught in the crossfire . 
Neither side trusts the other , so social wars have replaced meaningful political progress . 
As the violence of the social mobilizations and the level of discontent have grown , Bolivia &apos;s intellectuals and politicians remain in a state of shock , afraid of contradicting the masses . 
For their part , the populists can rouse the masses but fail to offer alternatives . 
They are nostalgic for the past and fearful of globalization . 
As the two sides collide , the country suffers : the outcome of the water war has meant that the poor still use the same dirty and expensive water , while the result of the gas war could mean that we remain without new export revenues . 
Bolivia needs leaders who can move the country beyond social wars that translate into stagnation . 
To move forward , both sides need to be realistic about Bolivia &apos;s past . 
The level of poverty - more visible with Bolivia &apos;s urbanization - is enormous , but it was worse before modernization efforts began . 
In fact , almost all indicators point to substantial progress made in the 21-year history of Bolivian democracy . 
Infant mortality has been cut in half , more citizens than ever enjoy educational opportunities , and electric , telephone , and sanitation services have expanded to serve a greater number of people . 
Moreover , the channels leading to higher social and political participation have multiplied . 
These advances are the result of audacious institutional reforms and the government &apos;s sustained and increased investment in social programs . 
They are part of the modern democracy . 
None of this progress , however , has been accompanied by the strengthening of our citizens &apos; sense of responsibility to their nation . 
In fact , while Bolivians demand the right to the many benefits of democracy , we fail to take seriously any obligation to contribute to the public good . 
Many evade or reject paying taxes , in part by appealing for compassion towards the poor . 
Leaders of the poor prefer to romanticize the past . 
Thus , while ethnic inequities have been dramatically reduced over the past 50 years , the historical memory remains vivid to new generations of the now urban Aymaras and Quechuas people . 
They rightly contest the degradation of their ancestors , but also idealize their rural , communitarian nature . 
The current state of affairs fails to meet their expectations , especially when contrasted with an idealized version of the past or the new patterns of consumption portrayed in the media . 
So expectations outpace reality , with politicians contributing to this by promising more than they can deliver - and thus losing the trust of their constituents . 
Malaise has grown ever more acute after many Bolivian political leaders and their supporters , worn down by the regional crisis of the 1990 &apos;s , expressed doubts over the modernization process . 
Institutional reforms meant the government could no longer use public resources with the same discretion as before . 
As a result , political parties and social organizations alike attacked reform efforts . 
Presidents B치nzer , Quiroga , and S치nchez de Lozada found their authority dwindling while movements against them grew ever more robust . 
After the political rebellion and lootings of this past February , Bolivia &apos;s Catholic bishops made real and consistent efforts to create a harmonious space for dialogue . 
This was easily accomplished , given Bolivia &apos;s memory of its losses : the loss of its seacoast to Chile in the War of the Pacific in 1879 , of coca crops to the US eradication program , and the country &apos;s mineral wealth to transnational corporations . 
Populists effectively converted these memories into a political force that rejected efforts leading to globalization and an open society . 
This conflict continues . 
In Bolivia , the populist / communitarian movement is in the saddle , but is failing to do much more than shelve reform projects . 
For the underlying conflict to be resolved , Bolivians must become convinced that reform is the right track , the only one , indeed , that leads to progress and authentic development .
