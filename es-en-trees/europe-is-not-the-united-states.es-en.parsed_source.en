Europe is Not the United States 
CAMBRIDGE - Europe is now struggling with the inevitable adverse consequences of imposing a single currency on a very heterogeneous collection of countries . 
But the budget crisis in Greece and the risk of insolvency in Italy and Spain are just part of the problem caused by the single currency . 
The fragility of the major European banks , high unemployment rates , and the large intra-European trade imbalance ( Germany &apos;s $ 200 billion current-account surplus versus the combined $ 300 billion current-account deficit in the rest of the eurozone ) also reflect the use of the euro . 
European politicians who insisted on introducing the euro in 1999 ignored the warnings of economists who predicted that a single currency for all of Europe would create serious problems . 
The euro &apos;s advocates were focused on the goal of European political integration , and saw the single currency as part of the process of creating a sense of political community in Europe . 
They rallied popular support with the slogan &quot; One Market , One Money , &quot; arguing that the free-trade area created by the European Union would succeed only with a single currency . 
Neither history nor economic logic supported that view . 
Indeed , EU trade functions well , despite the fact that only 17 of the Union &apos;s 27 members use the euro . 
But the key argument made by European officials and other defenders of the euro has been that , because a single currency works well in the United States , it should also work well in Europe . 
After all , both are large , continental , and diverse economies . 
But that argument overlooks three important differences between the US and Europe . 
First , the US is effectively a single labor market , with workers moving from areas of high and rising unemployment to places where jobs are more plentiful . 
In Europe , national labor markets are effectively separated by barriers of language , culture , religion , union membership , and social-insurance systems . 
To be sure , some workers in Europe do migrate . 
In the absence of the high degree of mobility seen in the US , however , overall unemployment can be lowered only if high-unemployment countries can ease monetary policy , an option precluded by the single currency . 
A second important difference is that the US has a centralized fiscal system . 
Individuals and businesses pay the majority of their taxes to the federal government in Washington , rather than to their state ( or local ) authorities . 
When a US state &apos;s economic activity slows relative to the rest of the country , the taxes that its individuals and businesses pay to the federal government decline , and the funds that it receives from the federal government ( for unemployment benefits and other transfer programs ) increase . 
Roughly speaking , each dollar of GDP decline in a state like Massachusetts or Ohio triggers changes in taxes and transfers that offset about 40 cents of that drop , providing a substantial fiscal stimulus . 
There is no comparable offset in Europe , where taxes are almost exclusively paid to , and transfers received from , national governments . 
The EU &apos;s Maastricht Treaty specifically reserves this tax-and-transfer authority to the member states , a reflection of Europeans &quot; unwillingness to transfer funds to other countries &quot; people in the way that Americans are willing to do among people in different states . 
The third important difference is that all US states are required by their constitutions to balance their annual operating budgets . 
While &quot; rainy day &quot; funds that accumulate in boom years are used to deal with temporary revenue shortfalls , the states &quot; &quot; general obligation &quot; borrowing is limited to capital projects like roads and schools . 
Even a state like California , seen by many as a poster child for fiscal profligacy , now has an annual budget deficit of just 1 % of its GDP and a general obligation debt of just 4 % of GDP . 
These limits on state-level budget deficits are a logical implication of the fact that US states cannot create money to fill fiscal gaps . 
These constitutional rules prevent the kind of deficit and debt problems that have beset the eurozone , where capital markets ignored individual countries &quot; lack of monetary independence . 
None of these features of the US economy would develop in Europe even if the eurozone evolved into a more explicitly political union . 
Although the form of political union advocated by Germany and others remains vague , it would not involve centralized revenue collection , as in the US , because that would place a greater burden on German taxpayers to finance government programs in other countries . 
Nor would political union enhance labor mobility within the eurozone , overcome the problems caused by imposing a common monetary policy on countries with different cyclical conditions , or improve the trade performance of countries that cannot devalue their exchange rates to regain competitiveness . 
The most likely effect of strengthening political union in the eurozone would be to give Germany the power to control the other members &quot; budgets and prescribe changes in their taxes and spending . 
This formal transfer of sovereignty would only increase the tensions and conflicts that already exist between Germany and other EU countries .
