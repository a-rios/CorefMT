Parliaments and Pacts 
JOHANNESBURG - The United Nations &quot; recent 17th Conference of the Parties ( COP-17 ) in Durban , South Africa succeeded in renewing the Kyoto Protocol , which aims to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions . 
But the meeting also highlighted the two major problems that plague international environmental negotiations . 
The first , unscientific skepticism , has an impact on the second , collective-action failure . 
Ultimately , only legislative bodies have the power to overcome this failure . 
Skepticism regarding the need for environmental action arises from the relationship between environmental degradation and per capita income . 
According to the environmental Kuznets curve ( EKC ) , degradation and pollution increase enormously at the early stages of economic growth . 
But , above a certain per capita income threshold , that trend reverses itself : at high income levels , economic growth correlates with environmental improvement , leading to the dubious conclusion that it might be possible to achieve sustainable growth without deviating from &quot; business as usual &quot; ( maintaining current emissions levels ) . 
This theory informs some countries &quot; reluctance to commit to the Kyoto Protocol &apos;s second term . 
But it is clearly wrong . 
The United States continues to have the world &apos;s highest per capita emissions levels , at 19 tons of CO2 per person annually , even though average US annual income , at $ 42,385 per capita , is also among the highest in the world . 
Clearly , wealth in itself is no guarantee of reduced CO2 emissions . 
Likewise , China &apos;s annual per capita income is $ 5,450 , but it emits only 4.7 tons of CO2 per person ( though , overall , it is the world &apos;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases ) . 
South Africans earn an average income of $ 8,857 per capita , but they emit a disproportionate 9.4 tons of CO2 per person . 
Moreover , the EKC perpetuates an erroneous assumption - that environmental damage will not curtail economic growth . 
In fact , research by the UN &apos;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change strongly suggests that a business-as-usual approach would lead to an era of irreversible environmental destruction that would preclude economic growth . 
We cannot afford such a strategy , especially as the poor would bear the brunt of the resulting climate change . 
The educated consensus is that the global climate &apos;s current trajectory must be reversed much more rapidly than business as usual would allow . 
Here , however , a second set of problems - divergent interests and the complexity of international negotiations - presents itself . 
When countries believe that high emissions levels are necessary to economic growth , they naturally become reluctant to agree to any binding protocol that would curtail emissions and thus stifle growth . 
This leads to a situation in which one participant can prevent the resolution of the larger group &apos;s dilemma . 
In 1988 , Harvard University &apos;s Robert Putnam wrote a ground-breaking paper called &quot; Diplomacy and Domestic Politics : The Logic of Two-Level Games . &quot; 
According to Putnam , international diplomacy and domestic politics represent a liberal democracy &apos;s two negotiating levels . 
A &quot; win-set &quot; occurs when a country &apos;s domestic and international interests harmoniously overlap . 
This overlap thus represents the room for compromise that countries &quot; international negotiators have . 
If a country &apos;s domestic politics are weak - no executive accountability , no genuine legislative oversight , and a poor relationship between citizen and state - its negotiator has a large win-set . 
For example , South Africa &apos;s international negotiators - executive ministers and senior civil servants - can compromise on just about anything , because they are not truly accountable to their population through the parliament . 
Logically , one would expect this to strengthen South Africa &apos;s diplomatic negotiating position . 
In fact , the diplomat who arrives at the international negotiating table with a smaller win-set - with less room for compromise - almost always secures a better deal for her country . 
Generally , a strong legislature results in a smaller win-set . 
But current COP negotiations make a mockery of most legislatures . 
Government ministers use international meetings to mouth platitudes , while ordinary citizens &quot; voices are muted . 
There is , quite simply , an excessive focus on executive power at many negotiating forums . 
Of course , a strong domestic legislature by itself is not enough to address the global collective-action problem : legislatures in countries like the US are overexposed to special interests that want to continue polluting . 
But if Americans were serious about securing a Kyoto commitment from their government , they would almost certainly get it . 
South Africans would not , because their parliament is hamstrung by the conflation of the state with the country &apos;s governing political party , the African National Congress . 
Strong legislatures , while not a sufficient condition for securing binding global agreements , are certainlynecessary for that purpose . 
A country &apos;s legislature is the single most important institution for protecting its citizenry from the excesses of the elite and the costly demands of narrow interests . 
The irony of most internationally binding agreements is that they are not actually binding . 
There is no supra-national body that will enforce the Kyoto Protocol ; hence Canada &apos;s disappointing decision to leave the process . 
And who would police emissions from China and America , even if they did commit to an international agreement ? 
In the absence of a global Leviathan , stronger domestic legislatures are the key to resolving the world &apos;s collective environmental problems . 
The less accountable a government is to its people , the less it will do for the world .
