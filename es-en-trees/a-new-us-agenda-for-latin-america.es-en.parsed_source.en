A New US Agenda for Latin America 
MEXICO CITY - For the next American president , fixing the international mess inherited from the Bush administration will be no simple task . 
While Latin America will not be a priority for either an Obama or McCain administration , continuing the United States &quot; neglect of the last seven years is no longer viable . 
Two distinct political / diplomatic challenges stand out : Cuba &apos;s imminent transition or succession crisis , and the continuing ascent of the region &apos;s &quot; two lefts , &quot; one represented by Venezuela &apos;s President Hugo Chávez and the other by Brazil &apos;s increasingly influential President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva . 
The next US administration will only prove successful if it grasps that Latin America is living through a moment that combines the best and worst aspects of its history : the fastest economic growth since the 1970 &quot; s , with poverty and inequality diminishing , and more democratic and respectful of human rights than ever before , but becoming more politically polarized . 
In Cuba , Fidel Castro &apos;s eventual passing from the scene represents an immense challenge . 
The US cannot continue with the failed policies of the past half-century . 
Demanding a full-fledged democratic transition as a pre-condition for normalizing US-Cuban relations is both unrealistic and unpalatable to Latin America . 
Yet the US cannot set aside the question of democracy and human rights in Cuba while it awaits the departure of Fidel &apos;s brother , Raúl . 
Realpolitik and fear of another exodus of Cuban refugees across the Florida Straits may tempt the US to pursue a &quot; Chinese &quot; or &quot; Vietnamese &quot; solution to Cuba : normalizing diplomatic relations in exchange for economic reform , while leaving the question of internal political change until later . 
But the US should not succumb to this temptation . 
The US , Canada , Europe , and Latin America have constructed a regional legal framework , which must not be abandoned , to defend democratic rule and human rights in the hemisphere . 
Cuba needs to return to the regional concert of powers , but it must accept this concert &apos;s rules . 
Holding free and fair elections may not be the primary issue , but nor are they issues that should be shelved in the interests of stability and expediency . 
Elections must instead be part of a comprehensive process of normalization : they should neither be a deal-breaker nor a non-issue . 
While the US should lift its trade embargo as soon as Cuba &apos;s transition begins , everything else should be conditional on Cuba initiating a process of resolving all outstanding issues . 
But Cuba is just part of what might be called Latin America &apos;s &quot; left &quot; problem . 
Indeed , much has been written recently about the ascent of the left in Latin America over the past decade . 
In fact , there are two lefts in the region : a modern , democratic , globalized and market-friendly left , found in Chile , Brazil , Uruguay , parts of Central America , and , up to a point , in Peru ; and a retrograde , populist , authoritarian , statist , and anti-American left , found in Mexico , El Salvador , Nicaragua , Cuba , Ecuador , Bolivia , Venezuela , and , to a lesser extent , in Argentina , Colombia , and Paraguay . 
Some of these &quot; lefts &quot; are in power ; some , as in Mexico in its last , disputed presidential election , barely missed conquering it , but may still do so . 
Over the past two years , it has become increasingly evident that the &quot; modern &quot; or &quot; soft &quot; left is , all in all , governing well . 
The other left has proved to be more extreme and erratic than many anticipated . 
The former feels no urge to &quot; export &quot; its &quot; model , &quot; whereas the latter has a strategy and the means to do so . 
The retrograde left today can realize Che Guevara &apos;s old dream : not &quot; one , two , many Vietnams , &quot; but &quot; one , two , many Venezuelas , &quot; winning power by the ballot and then conserving and concentrating it through constitutional changes and the creation of armed militias and monolithic parties . 
It can finance all of this with the support of Venezuela &apos;s state oil company , implementing social policies that are misguided over the long term but seductive in the short run , especially when carried out by Cuban doctors , teachers , and instructors . 
Herein lies a dilemma for the next US president : how to address the clear rift between the two lefts in a way that improves US-Latin American relations , fortifies the modern left , and weakens the retrograde left without resorting to the failed interventionist policies of the past . 
The best , strictly Latin America-focused steps , are self-evident , if not easily achievable . 
They require strengthening those governments of the modern left , or those of the center or center-right threatened by the old-fashioned left , and simultaneously making it clear to the latter that there is a price to be paid for violating the basic tenets of democracy , respect for human rights , and the rule of law . 
Turning its back in the face of such challenges is no longer a viable American option . 
Aside from areas of particular concern ( oil , arms , guerrillas , drugs ) , the US needs Latin America dearly nowadays because resistance to it is springing up everywhere , and with greater virulence than at any time since World War II &apos;s end . 
The next US president must reinvigorate a relationship that is ready to be substantially transformed for the first time since Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s Good Neighbor Policy of seven decades ago .
