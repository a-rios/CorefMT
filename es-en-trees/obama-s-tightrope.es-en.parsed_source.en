Obama &apos;s Tightrope 
CAMBRIDGE - According to a United States State Department official , the concept of &quot; smart power &quot; - the intelligent integration and networking of diplomacy , defense , development , and other tools of so-called &quot; hard &quot; and &quot; soft &quot; power - is at the heart of the Obama administration &apos;s foreign-policy vision . 
Currently , however , Obama &apos;s smart-power strategy is facing a stiff challenge from events in the Middle East . 
If Obama fails to support the governments in Egypt , Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , or Yemen , he may jeopardize important foreign-policy goals such as Middle East peace , a naval base in the Persian gulf , stability in oil markets , or cooperation against Al Qaeda terrorists . 
On the other hand , if he merely supports such governments , he will antagonize those countries &quot; new information-empowered civil society , thus jeopardizing longer-term stability . 
Balancing hard-power relations with governments with soft-power support for democracy is like walking a tightrope . 
The Obama administration has wobbled in this balancing act , but thus far it has not fallen off . 
Because the Obama administration has used the term &quot; smart power , &quot; some people think that it refers only to the US , and critics complain that it is merely a slogan , like &quot; tough love , &quot; used to sugar-coat American foreign policy . 
But smart power is by no means limited to the US . 
Combining hard and soft power is a difficult task for many states - but no less necessary for that . 
In fact , some small states have proven highly adept at smart-power strategies . 
Singapore has invested enough in its military defense to make itself seem as indigestible as &quot; a poisoned shrimp &quot; to neighbors that it wishes to deter . 
At the same time , it has combined this hard-power approach with attractive soft-power activities in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , as well as efforts to use its universities as hubs of regional non-governmental activities . 
Likewise , Switzerland long used mandatory military service and mountainous geography as hard-power resources for deterrence , while making itself attractive to others through banking , commercial , and cultural networks . 
Qatar , a small peninsula off the coast of Saudi Arabia , allowed its territory to be used as the US military headquarters in the invasion of Iraq , while at the same time sponsoring Al Jazeera , the most popular television station in the region , which was highly critical of American actions . 
Norway joined NATO for defense , but developed forward-looking policies on overseas development assistance and peace mediation to increase its soft power . 
Historically , rising states used smart-power strategies to good avail . 
In the nineteenth century , Bismarck &apos;s Prussia employed an aggressive military strategy to defeat Denmark , Austria , and France in three wars that led to the unification of Germany . 
But once Bismarck had accomplished that goal , he focused German diplomacy on creating alliances with neighbors and made Berlin the hub of European diplomacy and conflict resolution . 
One of Kaiser Wilhelm II &apos;s great mistakes two decades later was to fire Bismarck , fail to renew his &quot; reinsurance treaty &quot; with Russia , and challenge Britain for naval supremacy on the high seas . 
After the Meiji Restoration of 1867-1868 , a rising Japan built the military strength that enabled it to defeat Russia in 1905 . 
But it also followed a conciliatory diplomatic policy toward Britain and the US , and spent considerable resources to make itself attractive overseas . 
After the failure of its imperialist Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity scheme of the 1930 &quot; s ( which had a soft-power component of anti-European propaganda ) and its defeat in World War II , Japan turned to a strategy that minimized military power and relied on strategic alliance with the US . 
Japan &apos;s single-minded focus on economic growth achieved its goal , but the country developed only modest military and soft power . 
In its first decades , communist China built its military strength and simultaneously used the soft power of Maoist revolutionary doctrine and Third World solidarity to cultivate allies abroad . 
But , after the exhaustion of the Maoist strategy in the 1970 &quot; s , Chinese leaders turned to market mechanisms to foster economic development . 
Deng Xiaoping warned his compatriots to eschew external adventures that might jeopardize internal development . 
In 2007 , President Hu Jintao proclaimed the importance of investing in China &apos;s soft power . 
Given China &apos;s rising economic and military power , this was a smart decision . 
By accompanying its growing hard power with efforts to make itself more attractive , China aimed to stem its neighbors &quot; fears and tendency to balance Chinese power . 
In 2009 , China was justly proud of its success in emerging from the global recession with a high rate of economic growth . 
Many Chinese mistakenly concluded that this represented a shift in the balance of global power , and that the US was in decline . 
But such narratives can lead to conflict . 
Indeed , overconfidence in assessing its power led to more assertive Chinese foreign-policy behavior in the latter part of 2009 and 2010 . 
China miscalculated by deviating from the smart strategy of a rising power and violating Deng &apos;s dictum that China should proceed cautiously and &quot; skillfully keep a low profile . &quot; 
After Chinese leaders faced international criticism and deteriorating relations with the US , Japan , India , and other countries , they decided to return to Deng &apos;s smart-power strategy . 
So , as the Obama administration struggles to implement its smart-power strategy in the current revolutionary conditions of the Middle East , it is worth noting that the US is not alone in confronting the difficulties of combining hard and soft power successfully . 
Smart power is an important strategy for success in world politics , but no one said that it would be easy .
