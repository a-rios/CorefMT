A Metaphor for Obama 
NEW HAVEN - As US President Barack Obama begins his second term , he needs a simple way to express his vision and policies for the economy - a metaphor around which support for his policies might crystallize , thereby boosting his administration &apos;s political effectiveness . 
So , what makes a successful metaphor work ? 
The 2008 Obama campaign used the slogan &quot; Change we can believe in . &quot; 
Nor does &quot; Hope &quot; or &quot; Yes we can ! &quot; 
The 2012 Obama campaign used the one-word slogan &quot; Forward ! &quot; 
Once again , it signifies nothing about policies or their underlying philosophy . 
Every politician , whether liberal or conservative , wants to move forward , not backward . 
Obama &apos;s slogans are examples of &quot; dead metaphors &quot; : they are not part of an overall conceptual scheme . 
By contrast , in the 1930 &quot; s , President Franklin Roosevelt used a metaphor that remains very much alive today . 
The idea of a &quot; new deal &quot; was conceived during his first presidential election campaign in 1932 , though at the time he was still very vague about what the term stood for . 
Apparently , Roosevelt , or his speechwriters , borrowed it from A New Deal , a book by Stuart Chase that was published in 1932 and adapted the same year into a cover story for the magazine The New Republic . 
Chase described his new deal in general terms as &quot; the drastic and progressive revision of the economic structure , avoiding an utter break with the past . &quot; 
And , while the book &apos;s specific policy proposals bear little resemblance to Roosevelt &apos;s subsequent actions , the title had an intrinsic appeal that he must have recognized . 
The New Deal created an image of a commercial transaction , like the buyout of a company or an incentive package for executives - something that contracting parties bargain over and agree to . 
It is not imposed . 
By calling it a &quot; deal , &quot; Roosevelt made clear that the plan was not anti-business : it sounded like an offer to work , to participate , to seize an opportunity . 
And , because deals can be good or bad , fair or exploitative , the word &quot; new &quot; provided metaphoric depth , suggesting that Roosevelt &apos;s deal was better , fairer , and more attractive . 
The metaphor , overwhelmingly endorsed by voters , stood for Roosevelt &apos;s mandate to fix the ailing economy along lines that were innovative but still essentially capitalist . 
Some of his administration &apos;s initiatives , such as the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission , seemed anti-business to some at the time , but have long since been accepted as a boon to competition and dynamism by hemming in unfair or manipulative behavior . 
Metaphors , it turns out , are not just words . 
Modern neuroscience is revealing that metaphors are intrinsic to creativity , for their use activates diverse regions of the brain associated with their multiple meanings . 
Good metaphors are those that set off the right intuitive connections in our brains . 
For example , much progress in understanding sound and light resulted when scientists imagined them in terms of sea waves . 
Formulating a good metaphor for Obama &apos;s second term is itself a task for intuitive creative thought that entails rethinking what he will propose in his second term . 
A good metaphor might embody the idea of an &quot; inclusive economy . &quot; 
The word &quot; inclusive &quot; resonates strongly : Americans do not want more government per se ; rather , they want the government to get more people involved in the market economy . 
Opinion polls show that , above all , what Americans want are jobs - the beginning of inclusion . 
The parallel to Chase &apos;s book today is the 2012 bestseller Why Nations Fail by the economist Daron Acemoglu and the political scientist James Robinson . 
Acemoglu and Robinson argue that in the broad sweep of history , political orders that include everyone in the economic process are more likely to succeed in the long term . 
The time seems ripe for that idea , and it fits with the triumph of inclusiveness symbolized by Obama himself . 
The biggest successes of Obama &apos;s first term concerned economic inclusion . 
The Affordable Care Act ( &quot; Obamacare &quot; ) is providing more people with access to health care - and bringing more people to privately-issued insurance - than ever before in the United States . 
The Dodd-Frank financial reforms created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , so that privately issued financial products would serve the public better , and created incentives for derivatives to be traded on public markets . 
And he signed the JOBS Act , proposed by his Republican opponents , which aims to create crowdfunding Web sites that allow small investors to participate in start-up ventures . 
We have not reached the pinnacle of economic inclusion . 
There are hundreds of other possibilities , including improved investor education and financial advice , more flexible mortgages , better kinds of securitization , more insurance for a broader array of life &apos;s risks , and better management of career risks . 
Much more progress toward comprehensive public futures and derivatives markets would help , as would policies to encourage the emerging world to participate more in the US economy . 
( Indeed , the inclusion metaphor is essentially global in spirit ; had Obama used it in the past , his economic policies might have been less protectionist . ) 
The right metaphor would spin some of these ideas , or others like them , into a vision for America &apos;s future that , like the New Deal , would gain coherence as it is transformed into reality . 
On January 29 , Obama will give the first State of the Union address of his new term . 
He should be thinking about how to express - vividly and compellingly - the principles that have guided his choices so far , and that set a path for America &apos;s future .
