A Conservative Europe 
Last week Tony Blair , Jacques Chirac , and Gerhard Schroeder met in Berlin . 
They departed pledging to revive Europe &apos;s growth . 
We &apos;ve heard that empty promise before . 
Instead , the European Union needs a new direction . 
I say this as leader of the party which has been at the forefront of Britain &apos;s engagement with Europe . 
It was a Conservative government that first applied for membership in the early 1960 &apos;s . 
A Conservative government took the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community in 1973 . 
Margaret Thatcher worked with Jacques Delors to forge the Single Market in 1986 . 
So I have no doubt that Britain must remain influential within the Union . 
Faced with a new EU initiative , our traditional response has often been to oppose it , vote against it , lose the vote , then sulkily to adopt it while blaming everyone else . 
Many Europeans are sick of British vetoes . 
Of course there are basic requirements that all member states must accept . 
Foremost are the four freedoms of the single market ; free movement of goods , services , people and capital . 
But a single market does not require a single social or industrial policy , far less a common taxation policy . 
Allowing countries to pursue their own policies in these areas encourages competitiveness . 
Forcing common standards means that Europe will fall further behind as member states shuffle their costs onto their neighbours . 
Which areas should be applied to every member state , and which should be optional ? 
I believe that every member state should administer those policies that do not directly and significantly affect other member states . 
In areas which serve their national interest , individual members should decide whether to retain wholly national control or whether to co ‑ operate with others . 
The Union &apos;s members should form a series of overlapping circles : different combinations of members should be able to pool their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing . 
Precedents exist for this . 
NATO has been flexible since its inception . 
France signed up for membership but later refused to submit her armed forces to NATO &apos;s central command . 
Similar flexibility exists with the Euro , the Schengen Agreement , and the Social Chapter . 
These precedents can be extended . 
So far , everyone has had to move forward together , with individual countries negotiating specific opt ‑ outs . 
Instead of individual member states having fraught negotiations to opt ‑ out of a new initiative , those that support it can simply opt ‑ in . 
Countries that want to integrate further can do so . 
They don &apos;t need to drag Britain and others kicking and screaming in their wake because the others are not compelled to join them . 
In this way we can break free of the institutionalised tug of war that has characterised EU relations . 
I am not talking about a two ‑ speed Europe . 
That implies that we all agree on the destination and differ only about the speed of the journey . 
I don &apos;t want to reach the destination that some of our partners may aspire to . 
There are some who say that this would mean a loss of influence on the part of those countries which choose not to integrate more closely . 
Britain does not need a seat at the table when decisions on the Euro are taken . 
Our economy has not been adversely affected by staying out . 
Keeping the pound does not mean that we oppose the Euro , or hope for its failure . 
The European Union should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on doing fewer things more effectively . 
It should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that suits their national traditions , within the EU framework . 
It is on this basis that British Conservatives oppose the proposed constitution . 
We disagree with many of its contents , of course , but also oppose the idea of having an EU constitution at all . 
There is a world of difference between an association of nation states bound together by treaty , and a single entity , whether you call it a state or not , with its own legal personality , deriving its authority from its own constitution . 
If this constitution were accepted in anything like the proposed form , the EU would gain many attributes and trappings of statehood : its own president and foreign minister , its own legal system . 
The supremacy of EU law would derive not from Acts of national Parliaments but from a supra ‑ national constitution . 
That is a radical change , not the mere tidying ‑ up exercise some suggest . 
I do not believe it is right to make a change of such magnitude without specifically consulting the people on whose behalf we govern . 
Elected parliaments do not own our liberties . 
They safeguard them , and should not diminish those liberties without an explicit mandate . 
Any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the British people and to the people in each EU member state .
