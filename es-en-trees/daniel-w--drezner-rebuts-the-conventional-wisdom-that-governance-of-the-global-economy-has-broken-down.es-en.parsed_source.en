The System is Working 
MEDFORD , MASSACHUSETTS - As the latest G-20 meeting of finance ministers starts in Cairns , Australia , the Legion of Gloom is at it again . 
Their conventional wisdom is that &quot; the system &quot; - global governance structures ranging from the World Trade Organization and the G-20 to the major central banks - is badly broken and in desperate need of repair . 
In fact , the global economic order has worked remarkably well since 2008 . 
True , the first year of the Great Recession was more severe than the first year of the Great Depression . 
But , despite this initial shock , the system responded in a surprisingly nimble fashion . 
Compared to previous global downturns triggered by a financial crisis , the global economy bounced back robustly . 
Trade and output levels exceeded pre-crisis levels in most countries a few years ago , and global poverty continues to decline rapidly . 
One key to this rebound was that , in contrast to the 1930s , the global economy maintained existing conditions : trade barriers remained low , as did restrictions on foreign direct investment , and cross-border exchange continued to spread with the Internet . 
As the McKinsey Global Institute noted , with the exception of cross-border finance , global flows are just as robust now as they were before the crisis . 
There has even been a partial revamping of key global institutions , from the rise of the G-20 to reform of the International Monetary Fund . 
Indeed , the resiliency of markets to geopolitical tensions in Ukraine or the South China Sea has begun to worry some Fed officials . 
By any reasonable metric , multilateral institutions and great-power governments did what was necessary to preserve the global economy &apos;s openness . 
So why the widespread misperception that the system failed ? 
Here , we run into a dirty little secret of world politics : many commentators on international politics do not know much about economics or economic policy . 
International-affairs professionals frequently talk about &quot; high politics &quot; and &quot; low politics , &quot; and they usually relegate economic issues to the latter category . 
This ignorance matters when political commentators try to write about the global economy . 
They will naturally rely on the most accessible facts as their guide . 
To be fair , some of the most obvious data have indeed suggested fragmentation of the global economic order . 
The dormancy of the Doha Round of WTO talks , the public deadlock of some G-20 summits , and stalemates at the United Nations Security Council seem like sufficient evidence to proclaim that the status quo is imperiled - even if facts beyond the headlines belie that consensus . 
Consider the kerfuffle over &quot; currency wars . &quot; 
In 2010 , the Fed began hinting at a second round of quantitative easing , or QE2 . 
One of the policy externalities of QE - the Fed &apos;s purchase of long-term financial assets - was a depreciating dollar . 
Fearing domestic asset-price bubbles and upward pressure on their currencies from an inward rush of capital , many emerging-economy leaders complained loudly about what Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega called an &quot; international currency war . &quot; 
Lost in all of the hype was the fact that neither markets nor financial analysts were terribly perturbed about excessive exchange-rate volatility or the possibility of an actual currency war . 
After the autumn of 2008 , exchange-rate volatility slowly receded toward pre-crisis levels . 
Another common reason for the collective misperception is misplaced nostalgia . 
Former US National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft encapsulated the post-crisis conventional wisdom in 2012 : &quot; The postwar leaders set up the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , and the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade to develop rules of the road . 
The new G-20 is but a pale reflection of that once-brilliant institution building . &quot; 
But past efforts at building a global order have had their share of futility . Anyone familiar with the history of the Bretton Woods institutions knows that they experienced as many misses as hits . 
Compared to the past , the current order performed well above average . Perhaps the deepest explanation for the Legion of Gloom &apos;s strength is where they live . 
This matters because analysis of the international order remains anchored in the West . 
It is a general rule of political science that a faltering economy causes greater distrust in institutions . 
A weak economy feeds perceptions that the system is broken , and that those in authority are not to be trusted . 
So greater skepticism about all levels of governance in the OECD economies is not surprising . 
Analysts might be looking first at their local circumstances , and then extrapolating from that to their assessments of global institutions . 
Pessimism about slow national recoveries in the developed world is causing analysts to conflate poor domestic and regional governance with poor global governance . 
But the primary causes for domestic economic weakness in Japan , the US , the United Kingdom , and the eurozone are not global in origin . 
Japan &apos;s economy had been stagnating for almost two decades when the 2008 crisis erupted . 
Likewise , domestic policy stalemates and political uncertainty acted as a significant drag on the US recovery from the Great Recession . 
Does the system &apos;s remarkable resiliency since 2008 mean that it can withstand the next crisis ? 
In theory , yes - many of the post-2008 reforms have been designed to add shock absorbers to the global economy . 
But , in international relations , collective misperceptions can create their own reality . 
If pundits continue to insist that the system failed , wonks will devote time and effort to figuring out how to fix what is not broken . 
Moreover , it is extremely difficult to correct misperceptions once they ossify - particularly if the topic in question is outside a pundit &apos;s range of expertise . 
Ironically , the only thing that might stop the system from continuing to work is the low confidence of its greatest proponents .
