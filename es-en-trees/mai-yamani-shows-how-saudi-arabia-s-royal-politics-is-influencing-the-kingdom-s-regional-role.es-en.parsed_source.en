The Last of the Sudeiri Seven 
LONDON - Ever since the Al Saud clan established in 1932 the kingdom to which they gave their name , the exercise of power in Saudi Arabia has been shaped by the intrigues and intricacies of royal politics . 
But never before has this internal struggle had such profound ramifications for the region and beyond . 
With some 22,000 members , competition is a way of life in the world &apos;s largest ruling family - a dynamic set in motion by the Kingdom &apos;s founder , Abdul Aziz Al Saud , as he sought to secure the role of his 43 sons as future rulers , and sustained today by King Abdullah &apos;s succession strategy . 
A Saudi prince &apos;s status is based on his mother &apos;s tribe and his alliances with other male royals . 
From the outset , power was grouped on the basis of coalitions of full brothers , the most significant of whom were the &quot; Sudeiri Seven , &quot; Abdul Aziz &apos;s sons with his wife Hissah Al Sudeiri . 
With the assassination of King Faisal in 1975 by his nephew , the Sudeiri branch of the family became its dominant faction . 
Fahd , the eldest Sudeiri son , ruled for 23 years , the longest reign for a Saudi king . 
Abdullah &apos;s succession in 2005 posed a direct challenge to the Sudeiri brothers &quot; authority . 
Indeed , following Fahd &apos;s death , Sudeiri power was reduced significantly , with only Crown Princes Sultan and Naif holding key roles . 
Abdullah does not have a full brother . 
To block a Sudeiri restoration , he initially grouped together a number of marginalized , likeminded princes . 
Though Abdullah &apos;s &quot; Allegiance Council &quot; was subject to Sultan &apos;s control , its inclusion of Abdul Aziz &apos;s remaining sons and the sons of his deceased brothers - in particular , King Faisal &apos;s sons - gave the non-Sudeiri princes an institutional base of power . 
The shift in power from the Sudeiris to King Abdullah and his sons was accelerated by the death of the two Sudeiri crown princes within a period of eight months . 
After Sultan ( who served for decades as Minister of Defense ) died in October 2011 , Abdullah froze the Allegiance Council . 
Following the death of Naif ( who was Minister of Interior for 37 years ) in June 2012 , he removed Abdul Rahman , a Sudeiri , and appointed Salman as Crown Prince . 
Salman , too , is a Sudeiri , but his appointment represented a significant change , partly owing to his relative youth ( 78 years old ) . 
Indeed , perhaps to satisfy the desire of the United States , a key ally , for a new generation of Saudi rulers , the 89-year-old Abdullah passed over his octogenarian brothers and appointed the youngest , 65-year-old Prince Migrin , as Second Deputy , putting him first in line to the throne after Salman . 
Nearly a decade after succeeding Fahd , Abdullah is using his absolute power in other ways as well . 
For example , he has strengthened the National Guard &apos;s position by raising its status to that of a ministry , led by his eldest son , Mit &apos;ib . 
As a result of these and other changes , including the removal of key officials , such as Deputy Commander Badr Bin Abdul Aziz , the Guard &apos;s power is now equal , if not superior , to that of the army . 
Likewise , it is believed that Abdullah &apos;s son , Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdul Aziz , will soon replace Saud al Faisal , the world &apos;s longest-serving foreign minister . 
Abdullah also appointed his son Mish &apos;al as Governor of Najran , before raising Mish &apos;al &apos;s profile further , in December 2013 , by naming him Governor of Mecca , in place of Khalid Al Faisal . 
Meanwhile , Abdullah &apos;s son Turki has been made Deputy Governor of Riyadh . 
Whatever Abdullah &apos;s consolidation of power might mean domestically , the implications for the region are profound . 
In personalizing Saudi politics to the extent that he has , Abdullah has also personalized foreign policymaking . 
That has meant subordinating meritocracy to kinship and loyalty , which has inevitably weakened the regime &apos;s capacity to respond effectively to regional developments . 
To be sure , the King and his courtiers are much relieved that the Arab Spring did not lead to the creation of functioning democracies in Egypt , Yemen , Bahrain , Libya , or Syria . 
Better still , from their perspective , rival Islamist regimes that emerged proved to be either incompetent and easily overthrown ( as with Egypt &apos;s President Mohamed Morsi ) , or without appeal to others ( as in Tunisia ) . 
Nevertheless , the Arab Spring revolutions did undermine the pillars of the regional status quo , whose construction and maintenance the Kingdom had underwritten with its petrodollars . 
The uprisings ousted reliable old allies like Hosni Mubarak , and turned regimes such as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s into implacable enemies . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s initial response to the fracturing of the regional order was to increase its support for those of its allies - Jordan , Lebanon , and Bahrain - that were still standing , and to turn the Egyptian army into its proxy , leading to the removal of the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s government . 
Since 2013 , Syria has become the main focus of Saudi Arabia &apos;s attention in the region . 
Saudi rulers regard the battle between Assad and his opponents as part of the Kingdom &apos;s existential struggle against its main adversary , Iran . 
Thus , Saudi Arabia has become the primary source of financing and weapons for Sunni rebel forces fighting Assad &apos;s army , which is backed heavily by Shia Iran and its proxy , the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militia . 
Despite its unusually activist foreign policy , the Kingdom has failed to bring down Assad &apos;s regime , partly owing to US President Barack Obama &apos;s refusal to enforce his &quot; red line &quot; concerning the Assad regime &apos;s use of chemical weapons . 
As a result , Saudi rulers no longer feel constrained to wait for US approval of their actions - or even to refrain from acting against American interests . 
Saudi Arabia feels a deep fear of abandonment by the US , and is acting accordingly . 
The political transition at home , it seems , is being matched - for better or worse - by a diplomatic transition in the Kingdom &apos;s stance toward the region .
