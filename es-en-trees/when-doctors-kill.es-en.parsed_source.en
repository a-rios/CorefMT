When Doctors Kill 
PRINCETON - Of all the arguments against voluntary euthanasia , the most influential is the &quot; slippery slope &quot; : once we allow doctors to kill patients , we will not be able to limit the killing to those who want to die . 
There is no evidence for this claim , even after many years of legal physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia in the Netherlands , Belgium , Luxembourg , Switzerland , and the American state of Oregon . 
But recent revelations about what took place in a New Orleans hospital after Hurricane Katrina point to a genuine danger from a different source . 
When New Orleans was flooded in August 2005 , the rising water cut off Memorial Medical Center , a community hospital that was holding more than 200 patients . 
Three days after the hurricane hit , the hospital had no electricity , the water supply had failed , and toilets could no longer be flushed . 
Some patients who were dependent on ventilators died . 
In stifling heat , doctors and nurses were hard-pressed to care for surviving patients lying on soiled beds . 
Adding to the anxiety were fears that law and order had broken down in the city , and that the hospital itself might be a target for armed bandits . 
Helicopters were called in to evacuate patients . 
Priority was given to those who were in better health , and could walk . 
State police arrived and told staff that because of the civil unrest , everybody had to be out of the hospital by 5 p.m. 
On the eighth floor , Jannie Burgess , a 79-year-old woman with advanced cancer , was on a morphine drip and close to death . 
To evacuate her , she would have to be carried down six flights of stairs , and would require the attention of nurses who were needed elsewhere . 
But if she were left unattended , she might come out of her sedation , and be in pain . 
Ewing Cook , one of the physicians present , instructed the nurse to increase the morphine , &quot; giving her enough until she goes . &quot; 
It was , he later told Sheri Fink , who recently published an account of these events in The New York Times , a &quot; no-brainer . &quot; 
According to Fink , Anna Pou , another physician , told nursing staff that several patients on the seventh floor were also too ill to survive . 
She injected them with morphine and another drug that slowed their breathing until they died . 
At least one of the patients injected with this lethal combination of drugs appears to have otherwise been in little danger of imminent death . 
Emmett Everett was a 61-year-old man who had been paralyzed in an accident several years earlier , and was in the hospital for surgery to relieve a bowel obstruction . 
When others from his ward were evacuated , he asked not to be left behind . 
But he weighed 380 pounds ( 173 kilograms ) , and it would have been extremely difficult to carry him down the stairs and then up again to where the helicopters were landing . 
He was told the injection he was being given would help with the dizziness from which he suffered . 
In 1957 , a group of doctors asked Pope Pius XII whether it is permissible to use narcotics to suppress pain and consciousness &quot; if one foresees that the use of narcotics will shorten life . &quot; 
The Pope said that it was . 
In its Declaration on Euthanasia , issued in 1980 , the Vatican reaffirmed that view . 
The Vatican &apos;s position is an application of what is known as &quot; the doctrine of double effect . &quot; 
An action that has two effects , one good and the other bad , may be permissible if the good effect is the one that is intended and the bad effect is merely an unwanted consequence of achieving the good effect . 
Significantly , neither the Pope &apos;s remarks , nor the Declaration on Euthanasia , place any emphasis on the importance of obtaining the voluntary and informed consent of patients , where possible , before shortening their lives . 
According to the doctrine of double effect , two doctors may , to all outward appearances , do exactly the same thing : that is , they may give patients in identical conditions an identical dose of morphine , knowing that this dose will shorten the patient &apos;s life . 
Yet one doctor , who intends to relieve the patient &apos;s pain , acts in accordance with good medical practice , whereas the other , who intends to shorten the patient &apos;s life , commits murder . 
Dr. Cook had little time for such subtleties . 
Only &quot; a very na√Øve doctor &quot; would think that giving a person a lot of morphine was not &quot; prematurely sending them to their grave , &quot; he told Fink , and then bluntly added : &quot; We kill &quot; em . &quot; 
In Cook &apos;s opinion , the line between something ethical and something illegal is &quot; so fine as to be imperceivable . &quot; 
At Memorial Medical Center , physicians and nurses found themselves under great pressure . 
Exhausted after 72 hours with little sleep , and struggling to care for their patients , they were not in the best position to make difficult ethical decisions . 
The doctrine of double effect , properly understood , does not justify what the doctors did ; but , by inuring them to the practice of shortening patients &quot; lives without obtaining consent , it seems to have paved the way for intentional killing . 
Roman Catholic thinkers have been among the most vocal in invoking the &quot; slippery slope &quot; argument against the legalization of voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted dying . 
They would do well to examine the consequences of their own doctrines .
