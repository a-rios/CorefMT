Reining in Europe &apos;s Debtor Nations 
MUNICH - The eurozone countries have now agreed to provide some € 80 billion in cheap loans to Greece over the next three years , and hope that the International Monetary Fund will provide another € 15 billion at the least . 
Obviously , markets still believe that Greece will default on its debt . 
Greece , moreover , has another huge problem : its current-account deficit is currently a whopping 13 % of net national income , which means that € 27 billion have to be financed annually by borrowing or selling Greek assets . 
With international investors no longer willing to finance this deficit , and even shying away from refinancing existing Greek debt , only three possibilities remain . 
The first is that the European Union provides the necessary funds on a permanent basis , creating a &quot; European Transfer Union &quot; to the benefit of the deficit countries , including Portugal , Spain , Ireland and Italy . 
The second option is for Greece to go through a depression , reducing its wages and prices . 
Finally , Greece could leave the euro and devalue its currency . 
All three of these options are painful , albeit for different reasons . 
The first is unbearable for the more stable EU countries , because it would deprive them of their wealth and suck them into a dangerous fiscal maelstrom . 
The second would lead to even more riots in the streets of Greece , with unforeseeable political consequences . 
As all the possible options are bad , the situation qualifies as a veritable Greek tragedy such as those hitherto seen only on stage . 
Politicians believe that imposing more budget discipline on Greece is a fourth possibility . 
But this is not true . Budget discipline will work only insofar as it drives the country into a depression and induces a real devaluation through a reduction in wages and prices , which is option two . 
While that would stimulate inward tourism and real-estate sales , what sounds easy and manageable to the layman would in fact be the most problematic solution for Greece , because it would add fuel to internal protests to a point that could destabilize the eastern Mediterranean . 
The tragedy could have been avoided if Greece had shown unyielding , timely debt discipline . 
The country would then have been unable to price itself out of the market through an artificial debt-financed boom . 
There would have been no high , but also no hangover . 
The lesson to be learned from the crisis is that a currency union needs ironclad budget discipline to avert a boom-and-bust cycle in the first place . 
Again , there are three possibilities worth considering : 
· The American system . 
In the United States , there is no bailout mechanism and no intergovernmental loans . 
Profligate states go bankrupt if necessary . 
Markets encourage the required debt discipline in a timelier manner by charging higher interest rates on government debt . 
This system has worked quite well since the nineteenth century , even though ( or because ) it involved a substantial number of state bankruptcies . 
Given the perilous state of California &apos;s finances , it may well be tested soon . 
· The German system . 
In Germany , a &quot; stability council &quot; must approve state budgets . 
According to the German Constitution , the German states ( or Länder ) will not be permitted any budget deficit after 2020 , and must already pursue fiscal consolidation in order to meet that goal . 
In exceptional cases , a state may run a deficit , but its cumulative volume must not exceed 1.5 % of GDP . 
If it exceeds 1 % of GDP , the excess is subtracted from the budget allowed for the following year , provided that the economy is in an upswing with a shrinking output gap . 
· A new EU system , following the logic of the bailout strategy that the EU is currently applying , should be extended to include automatic fines for &quot; debt sinners . &quot; 
Loans would be provided by other EU countries if necessary , taking the form of covered state bonds collateralized with privatizable state assets . 
Their accumulated sum would be limited to 10 % of GDP . 
Should a country default despite these loans , it would have to leave the euro and devalue . 
Automatic fines would punish any country whose debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s 60 % cap or whose budget deficit exceeds the 3 % -of-GDP limit . 
The fines could be as high as the interest premium would be in the absence of help , thereby ensuring that the benefit of enhanced stability under the euro accrues to all eurozone countries , rather than to the profligate members themselves . 
In order to prevent sinners from getting caught in a debt trap , the fines could take the form of covered bonds collateralized with privatizable state assets . 
All of this is unpleasant , and it may not appeal to politicians who believe in dreams . 
It is time for Europe to face its true options in order to maintain the euro &apos;s stability - and that of the EU itself .
