Do Europeans Really Fear Migrants ? 
LONDON - Far-right parties are set to make substantial gains in the upcoming European Parliament election . 
Though analysts differ on whether this populist wave is fleeting , whether it will seriously harm European Union policymaking , and whether it will be sustained in national elections , they tend to agree on at least one thing : support for such parties is often grounded in anti-migrant sentiment . 
Appearances and received wisdom , however , can deceive . 
Populism takes many forms , and the logic of its success varies from place to place . 
But economic discontent ( often associated with the euro ) , anger at the political establishment , the resurgent appeal of nationalism , and negative sentiment toward the EU are all recurring themes , whether it be in the United Kingdom , France , Hungary , Italy , Greece , the Netherlands , or Denmark . 
It is also true that migrants figure prominently in populist rhetoric throughout the EU . 
But it would be dangerously mistaken to conclude that the mere presence of migrants in Europe fuels support for extremists . 
A much stronger case could be made that it is the absence of effective policies to manage migration that has alienated European voters . 
Strikingly , the far right only has a faint heartbeat in those EU member states that have been the most proactive in managing migration and immigrant integration . 
Germany , Spain , Sweden , and Portugal , for example , have done more than most others to open legal channels for migration and invest in migrants &quot; integration . 
In these countries , populism is not fundamentally changing the contours of the political debate . 
In Spain and Portugal , for example , where unemployment is very high , populist parties barely have a foothold . 
In fact , these countries &quot; citizens generally support legal migration and perceive integration efforts as being successful . 
In Germany , 62 % of those surveyed by the German Marshall Fund view immigration as more of an opportunity than a problem ; that number reaches 68 % in Sweden . 
In Portugal , when asked if first-generation immigrants are well integrated , 79 % of respondents said yes , as did 63 % of those surveyed in Spain . 
By speaking openly about migration and addressing voters &quot; legitimate concerns , politicians in these countries also have helped to ground public debate in reality . 
They frame immigration as a generally positive development that helps to mitigate the problems of aging populations and labor-market gaps . 
As a result , fear is muted : asked whether immigrants take away jobs from native-born citizens , 80 % of Germans and 77 % of Swedes said that they do not . 
In places where the rhetoric surrounding immigration flies off the handle , as in the UK , perceptions are sometimes grossly distorted . 
The average Briton , for example , believes that 31 % of the UK population was born abroad , whereas the actual number is 13 % . 
Compare that to Sweden , where the difference between perception and reality is just three percentage points . 
Reality-based debate and policymaking can fundamentally transform the negative dynamics surrounding migration . 
Europeans also have far fewer cultural concerns about migrants than media coverage might lead one to believe : 69 % of Europeans believe that migrants do not pose a cultural threat . 
In fact , almost two-thirds - including 82 % in Sweden and 71 % in Germany - say that immigrants enrich their national culture . 
By contrast , government parties that have failed to think progressively about migration or that do not contest populist rhetoric adequately ( or at all ) are suffering the most ahead of the European Parliament election . 
Indeed , by doing too little to manage migration and integration , some governments have ceded control to smugglers , traffickers , and exploitative employers , thereby contributing to social division and hampering economic growth . 
Not only are they empowering populists ; they are becoming more and more like them . 
There is still time to move in a more sensible direction . 
Continent-wide , Europeans remain levelheaded about migration . 
Overall , according to the Germany Marshall Fund , 62 % of Europeans are not worried about legal migration . 
Large majorities , meanwhile , agree that &quot; migrants generally help address labor-market shortages . &quot; 
Such grounded beliefs prove that there is space for an honest debate about the role of migration in Europe &apos;s future . 
The scale of migration should be a matter of enlightened public debate , one that balances economic , humanitarian , and social considerations . 
Politicians who have the courage to lead such a conversation in a constructive manner might be surprised by the public &apos;s response .
