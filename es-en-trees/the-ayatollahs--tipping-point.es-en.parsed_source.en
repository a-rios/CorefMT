The Ayatollahs &quot; Tipping Point 
SOUTHAMPTON , ENGLAND - Once the crowds were in the streets in Tehran , one could , if one knew the script , begin the countdown : if today there are mass protests , tomorrow there will be threats of retaliation in the name of &quot; national security . &quot; 
By day three , we will see journalists imprisoned and media shut down ; day four , bloody reprisals against protesters by secret police ; day five , arrests of key opposition figures . 
Sure enough , right on schedule , each of those steps was set in motion in Iran , within the space of a week . 
These same ten steps occurred in Thailand in 2006 - in ten days , and in seven days in Myanmar a year later . 
The script is so well known by now among the world &apos;s would-be dictators that it can take less than a week to lock down a country . 
None of this should surprise anyone anymore . 
We should understand that this time-tested script for establishing or enforcing a dictatorship exists - but so does a counter-strategy for opening up a closed society . 
When a would-be dictator - anywhere , any time , on the right or the left - wants to close an open society or initiate a crackdown against a democracy movement , he follows ten classic steps : invoke a threat , create secret prisons , develop a paramilitary force , establish a surveillance apparatus , arbitrarily detain citizens , infiltrate citizen groups , target key individuals , go after journalists , call criticism &quot; treason , &quot; and subvert the rule of law . 
Once these steps are put in place , it is extremely difficult for a pro-democracy movement to survive - but not impossible if counter-pressure is applied correctly . 
History shows again and again - throughout the modern era and around the world - that people do indeed have some powerful tools to reestablish an open society if they were willing to use them . 
The counter-script for establishing or restoring pro-democratic conditions consists of more mass protest ; the appearance and display of resistance symbols ; the emergence of enough spokespeople throughout society that all of them cannot be arrested at once ; overt civil and covert disobedience , at every level of society , that brings the economy to a halt ; withdrawal of support by lawyers and judges for the regime &apos;s decisions ; international sanctions tied to human rights and clean elections ; the refusal - tricky but not unattainable - of many soldiers and police to fire at unarmed citizens ; and , finally , when the rule of law is reestablished , serious prosecutions of the defeated regime &apos;s ringleaders . 
When we see footage of nonviolent protesters being brutally beaten by police and militia members , it is painful to deliver the message that , if history is a guide , continued street protest will make the difference between Iran being like Myanmar or , possibly , like Czechoslovakia . 
Time and again , when mass street protest has been sustained for more than a week or two , a regime - even one that has begun beating and arresting protesters -eventually finds it practically and psychologically difficult to sustain its hold . 
Street protest , if it can sustain itself for more than that crucial first week , has an effect that is both tactical and emotional ; mass protest during the French Revolution made it clear to the courtiers that this rebellion would be too profound to quell in the usual manner ; street protests in the American colonies , in the face of arrest or worse , made the colonies ungovernable even before George III waged a costly , unpopular war . 
In Estonia in the 1980 &quot; s , the small , illegal protests that surrounded the public singing of the banned national anthem grew , and Estonians were emboldened as their numbers swelled by the thousands daily . 
In the United States , street protests helped bring the Vietnam war to an end , and the mass protests of the civil rights movement showed that , as Martin Luther King , Jr. put it , &quot; business as usual &quot; could no longer continue . 
According to King , disruptive mass protest exposes the tension that has been hidden or ignored , so that it can be addressed . 
Iran &apos;s citizens - and all people longing to resist a tyrannical government or to protest in an established democracy - should bear that lesson in mind . 
Protest that works must disrupt business as usual and , ideally , stop traffic . 
Iranian citizens have shown great courage , and they would do well to continue pouring into the street and sitting down , lying down , or standing still . 
Unless a regime is willing to start machine-gunning its citizens , peaceful , steady , long-term disruption of &quot; business as usual &quot; always works . 
What the West can do is apply pressure on Iran - and on other governments in the future - to assure and account for the safety of protesters . 
Natan Sharansky said that this tactic - the West tracking and demanding accountability for the treatment of individual internal dissenters - helped break up the Soviet Union . 
In this crisis , the US president should form a united front with human rights groups , which can advise him exactly how to follow , sustain , and support those Iranians who have been or may yet be arrested , or worse . 
Barack Obama says that America &quot; stands with &quot; those who support free assembly . 
But it is a start .
