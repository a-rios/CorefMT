Are Saudi Women Next ? 
LONDON - The unexpected visibility and assertiveness of women in the revolutions unfolding across the Arab world - in Tunisia , Egypt , Libya , Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and elsewhere - has helped propel what has become variously known as the &quot; Arab awakening &quot; or &quot; Arab Spring . &quot; 
Major changes have occurred in the minds and lives of women , helping them to break through the shackles of the past , and to demand their freedom and dignity . 
Since January 2011 , images of millions of women demonstrating alongside men have been beamed around the world by television journalists , posted on YouTube , and splashed on the front pages of newspapers . 
One saw women from all walks of life marching in hope of a better future , for themselves and for their countries . 
They appeared prominently - eloquent and outspoken , marching daily , holding caricatures of dictators and chanting calls for democratic change . 
They walked , bussed , traveled in carts , telephoned and tweeted with compatriots , motivated in part by social demands - above all for their own empowerment . 
The contrast between this dynamic space for open protest and Saudi Arabia could hardly be starker . 
Saudi women find themselves living in a petrified system . 
Faces of the royal family are seen everywhere ; the faces of women are shrouded , forcibly hidden . 
Nowhere else in the world do we see modernity experienced as such a problem . 
Skyscrapers rise out of the desert , yet women are not permitted to ride with men in their lifts . 
Nor are they allowed to walk in the streets , drive a car , or leave the country without the permission of a male guardian . 
Fatima , a young woman from Mecca , sent me an email at the height of the Egyptian revolution : &quot; Forget about the cries for freedom ; 
She went on , &quot; And the mataw &apos;a ( the religious police , known officially as the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice , and whose leader has ministerial rank ) have been given the right to humiliate us in public . &quot; 
Indeed , the mutaw &apos;a saw their wide powers enhanced even more by decrees issued by King Abdullah in March , after helping to suppress protests in the kingdom earlier in the month . 
Yet globalization knows no limits , not even those set by the guardians of Islamic probity . 
Nine-year-old Saudi girls chat online , disregarding fatwas issued by Wahhabi clerics that forbid them access to the Internet without the supervision of a male guardian . 
Many women remain secretly glued to satellite television channels , watching their peers in the public squares of Egypt or Yemen , beyond their reach but not beyond their imagination . 
On May 21 , a brave woman named Manal al Sharif broke the silence and apathy , daring to defy the ban on women driving . 
For the next week , she sat in a Saudi prison . 
But , within two days of her detention , 500,000 viewers had watched the YouTube video of her excursion . 
Thousands of Saudi women , frustrated and humiliated by the ban , have vowed to stage a &quot; driving day &quot; on June 17 . 
Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that forbids women to drive cars . 
The system of confinement that the ban represents is justified neither by Islamic texts , nor by the nature of the diverse society that the Al Saud and their Wahhabi partners &quot; rule . 
Indeed , it is far removed even from the rest of the Arab world - which has become glaringly obvious in the context of massive social upheaval almost everywhere else in the region . 
Enforced segregation is mirrored in every aspect of Saudi life . 
Religious education constitutes up to 50 % of students &quot; curriculum . 
As a result , Wahhabi dogma penetrates every home in the country . 
Textbooks - pink for girls , blue for boys , each with different contents - emphasize the rules prescribed by Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab , an eighteenth-century cleric and the founder of Wahhabism . 
The Saudi judicial system is one of the most formidable obstacles to women &apos;s aspirations , relying on Islamic interpretations that protect a defensive patriarchal system . 
Indeed , not only do judges &quot; decisions support the system , but the reverse is also true : patriarchy has become the driving force of the law . 
Thus , Saudi women are barred from the legal profession on the basis of a Wahhabi stricture that &quot; a woman is lacking in mind and religion . &quot; 
In other words , the rule of law in Saudi Arabia is the rule of misogyny - the comprehensive legal exclusion of women from the public sphere . 
Saudi rulers have announced that demonstrations are haram - a sin punishable by jail and flogging . 
Now some clerics have pronounced driving by women to be foreign-inspired haram , punishable in the same way . 
Yet , despite such threats , thousands of Saudi women joined &quot; We are all Manal al Sharif &quot; on Facebook , and countless other videos of women driving have appeared on YouTube since her arrest . 
Like Mamal , they , too , have been detained , and the government appears determined to prosecute them . 
But Wajeha al Huwaider , Bahia al Mansour , Rasha al Maliki , and many other activists are nonetheless insisting that driving a car is their legitimate right , and are eloquently demanding the removal of restrictions and an end to women &apos;s dependency . 
Rosa Parks &quot; revolutionary bravery in refusing to move to the back of a Montgomery , Alabama municipal bus in 1955 helped spark the American civil rights movement . 
We shall soon find out whether Manal al Sharif &apos;s defiance of the Saudi regime &apos;s systemic confinement of women produces a similar effect .
