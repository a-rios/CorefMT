Senegal &apos;s Democracy Put to the Test 
Senegal , a country whose population is 90 % Muslim , is one of the Islamic world &apos;s most peaceful and democratic countries . 
This tranquility has been helped by the elaborate &quot; rituals of respect &quot; that have developed between the secular state and the Sufi orders , and the excellent relations between the country &apos;s Muslim majority and the Catholic minority at all levels of society . 
The secular state and religious groups have cooperated on AIDS prevention - to the extent AIDS affects only about 1 % of the population , compared to more than 20 % in some African countries . 
The secular state , supported by feminist groups and some transnational non-governmental organizations , banned female genital mutilation in 1999 , without triggering massive Muslim protests . 
Mistakenly viewed by some as an example of French laicit√© , which might be characterized as &quot; freedom of the state from religion , &quot; Senegal , although once a French colony , has crafted a very different model of &quot; equal respect and equal support for all religions . &quot; 
In fact , secularism in Senegal resembles that in India more than anywhere else . 
In Senegal , fundamentalist schools , as well as Iranian and Saudi Arabian aid in the education sector , find little space or demand . 
The Senegalese government spends about 40 % of the state budget on education and provides free public schooling to almost 85 % of all primary school age children . 
By contrast , Pakistan , spends just 8 % and six million primary age children have no public schooling . 
Furthermore , since 2003 state schools offer religious instruction ( using authorized textbooks that are never Wahhabi in spirit ) , with the informal approval of secular and Sufi teachers alike . 
Parents are increasingly sending their sons , and now their daughters , to these tolerant , accredited , and democracy-compatible schools . 
Some parents still elect to send their children to private , often Franco-Arabic , schools . 
However , the Senegalese pattern of state-religious relations allows the government to provide partial funding to such private religious schools . 
In return , the state inspects such schools regularly . 
The only schools the state does not supervise are Koran-based schools , which some parents use as a complement - but seldom a full substitute - for state education . 
But most of the traditional religious teachers in such schools practice Senegalese rituals of respect , and , in any case , view Saudi Arabian-style schools as alien competitors . 
Yet , despite all these positive developments , Senegal &apos;s unusual democracy is imperiled . 
The reasons have nothing to do with the rise of political Islam , but everything to with poor electoral practices by elected incumbents and international indifference . 
The current president , Abdoulaye Wade , who is over 80 years old , is running for re-election on February 25 . 
Wade has substantial international prestige , because he led the final phase of the country &apos;s long democratic transition in 2000 . 
But Wade postponed legislative elections , originally scheduled for June 2006 , first to February 2007 , and later , by presidential decree , to June 2007 . 
Two weeks ago there were almost daily discussions about the possibility of the presidential elections being postponed indefinitely . 
It now appears that there will be a presidential election , but will it be fair ? 
A month before the election , only 64 % of citizens who had registered had received their voting cards . 
On January 28 , a peaceful but &quot; unauthorized &quot; demonstration by opposition parties was brutally repressed by the police and three presidential candidates were arrested for the day . 
None of this was shown on television . 
In a country with little tradition of political violence , too many mysterious things are happening . 
An early strong critic of Wade , Talla Sylla , had his face beaten with a hammer . 
Abdou Latif Coulibaly , the author of two books critical of Wade , received a death threat , as did Alioune Tine , the leader of a main human rights organization , Raddho . 
So Senegal &apos;s &quot; rituals of respect &quot; may not be holding . 
The Bush administration , in bad need of a democratic Muslim ally , wants Wade to fill that bill , and seems to have decided , in the words of one high , but disappointed , US official , to give Wade a &quot; pass . &quot; 
Whereas the US is willing to spend $ 147 billion next year in the name of an implausible democracy in Iraq , it refuses to spend any imagination or money to shore up one of the most creative models of peace and democracy in the Islamic world . 
That is terrible for Senegal and Africa , as well as for America &apos;s credibility . 
The European Union says that it has been caught unawares by the situation and has not budgeted any funds for election observers to go to Senegal . 
France , the former colonial ruler - and still a influential force in the country - has been silent . 
But Senegal &apos;s democracy hangs in the balance . 
In the coming weeks , attention by the international press , by international election observers , and by supporters of tolerance around the world could make a critical difference .
