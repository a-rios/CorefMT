Latin America &apos;s Forbidden Debates 
Twenty-five years ago , only Colombia , Costa Rica , and Venezuela were reasonably stable Latin American democracies . 
Today , what might be considered electoral democracies are found throughout the region . 
Indeed , at no time since independence has there been such a proliferation of democracy in Latin America . 
But what has been gained is never guaranteed . 
A military coup is not the only way to destroy a free society . 
As the political scientist Guillermo O &apos;Donnell observed , democracy &apos;s flame can also be extinguished gradually when dreams of justice and social progress fail to materialize . 
During the 25 years of the spectacular rise of Latin America democracy , per capita income has increased by a mere $ 300 . 
Even in Chile , which enjoyed high economic growth and cut poverty in half , and Brazil , which lowered the percentage of citizens living below the poverty line by a third during the 1990 &quot; s , the concentration of wealth has increased . 
This isn &apos;t for lack of structural reforms . 
At the same time that political changes helped spread democracy across Latin America , structural economic reforms were strengthened . 
Samuel Morley of the UN &apos;s Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean put together an index that graded reforms aimed at economic deregulation , trade liberalization , and opening up financial markets . 
Morley &apos;s index , on a scale of zero to one , stood at 0.52 in 1977 , but rose to 0.82 by 2000 . 
Nevertheless , profound economic and political transformation in Latin America has masked a deep disparity between reforms and reality - indeed , between hopes and their fulfillment . 
Although this gap endangers the future of Latin American democracy , many Latin American leaders consider it apostasy to admit that living standards are little better today than they were during the era of dictators . 
Their first inclination is to defend these electoral democracies on the grounds they no longer engage in killing or in torture . 
But consider this : Amnesty International and the US State Department have three basic indicators of human rights - the right to life , the right to physical safety , and the right to freedom from political persecution . 
They use a scale of one to five , with one representing an optimal level of human rights and five indicating conditions of general terror . 
During 1977 , the worst year for human rights violations , the average Latin American rate of terror stood at 3.0 . 
In 2001 , after two decades of democracy , it was 2.6 . 
By contrast , the terror index for Western Europe was 1.1 . 
Still , to insist that Latin American democracy has been a major disappointment would not merely be pessimistic ; it would fail to recognize that the most important values of a free society include the capacity to change , to rectify , and to improve . 
The problem does not lie with our shortcomings , but with the way we choose to resolve them . 
The role of the state , the market , and the region &apos;s place in the global economy all need urgent attention and discussion . 
Yet our leaders consider these subjects taboo . 
Our first challenge is to recognize that electoral government has failed to lead to a true democracy of the people . 
Our second challenge is to find the keys to open that door . 
Latin America seems to lack the will to establish a true people &apos;s democracy , and it has tied itself to a narrow market economy whose bad outcomes are readily apparent to everyone . 
But government has a central role to play in the debate over the creation of democracy - one more important than its oversight of fiscal matters . 
Certainly , merely returning to big government will not resolve anything , because it is inefficient and generates the opposite but equivalent imbalance . 
Indeed , it may be that the framework for a state that can preside over a true democracy has yet to be created . 
The same may be said about the market economy . 
The Washington Consensus - with its emphasis on liberalization , deregulation , and privatization - does not forecast greater per capita income , nor does it eliminate poverty . 
It does , however , increase inequality . 
Does that mean we should abandon the market economy ? 
No , because , simply put , political liberty cannot be separated from economic liberty . 
Ensuring Latin American nations &quot; autonomy in the global economy is yet another vital question that must be debated , because it is essential that national governments have the power to execute their citizens &quot; will . 
Thus , the commercial and political aspects of government &apos;s responsibilities must be integrated . 
This does not require immediately creating new administrative structures , but skillful political coordination can and must be at the heart of this debate and ensuring its successful outcome . 
We cannot base our actions solely on commercial will , because that limits us to operating strictly at the whims of international markets . 
As the political scientist Samuel Huntington has said , &quot; Business may bring communities closer but it cannot bring them into harmony . &quot; 
Today , Latin American states need political agreements that protect them from becoming the victims of both North American unilateralism and the global economy . 
Failure to engage in critical debates about Latin American democracy will surely provide fertile ground for reviving the authoritarian fantasies of the past . 
If , on the other hand , political leaders lose their fear of debating important issues , Latin America can move forward . 
Having won some of their freedom , Latin America &apos;s people should not be forced to pay the high price implied by their leaders &quot; failure to open forbidden issues to debate .
