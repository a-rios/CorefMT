Nigeria , Slouching Toward Nationhood 
ABUJA - Nigerians like political theater , particularly if it is loud , colorful , and has a rich cast of &quot; good &quot; and &quot; bad &quot; characters . 
Such melodrama abounded from November 2009 , when ailing President Umaru Yar &apos;Adua was flown out of the country for treatment , until the just-concluded general elections , Nigeria &apos;s fourth since military rule ended in 1999 . 
According to the official results , Goodluck Jonathan , who succeeded Yar &apos;Adua upon his death and became the ruling People &apos;s Democratic Party ( PDP ) candidate , was sworn in as President on May 29 . 
Jonathan was the unlikeliest of candidates in Nigeria &apos;s take-no-prisoners presidential power game . 
He is an Ijaw , an ethnic minority in the South-South , one of Nigeria &apos;s six political regions , whereas the country &apos;s governance had historically been dominated by the three largest ethnic groups - the Hausa-Fulani , found mainly in the North-West and North-East , the Igbo in the South-East , and the Yoruba in the South-West . 
Complex ethnic bargaining had made Jonathan Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s running mate in the fraudulent 2007 election . 
Jonathan entered the election campaign fighting off powerful conservative northern politicians who insisted that the PDP &apos;s informal agreement to rotate power periodically between north and south implied that their region was entitled to five years more in office . 
After all , they argued , Olusegun Obasanjo , Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s predecessor from the largely Christian south , had wielded presidential power for eight uninterrupted years . 
But an often-unacknowledged feature of Nigerian politics is that citizens usually back underdogs . 
The PDP , which had been in power since 1999 and had failed to tackle the country &apos;s pressing economic and political problems , was not a favorite at the polls . 
Moreover , the consensus countrywide was that the revamped Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) , under the leadership of Attahiru Jega , a respected university teacher , would help cut the PDP down to size by ensuring free and fair elections at long last . 
In the legislative elections on April 9 , the presidential contest on April 16 , and state elections ten days later , the PDP &apos;s dominance was indeed reduced . 
The PDP is still in firm control of the central and state legislatures , and has retained the majority of the state governorships . 
Jonathan not only won a popular majority in the presidential contest , beating Muhammadu Buhari of the CPC , who enjoyed broad support in the north ; he also fulfilled the additional constitutional requirement of gaining one-quarter of the votes in two-thirds of the 36 states . 
Some local journalists and civil-society groups are challenging the credibility of some of the results , and the CPC is challenging the outcome of the presidential vote at the INEC . 
Nigeria &apos;s main challenge now is to maintain peace and unity between the country &apos;s fractious ethnic groups while implementing policy , political , and constitutional reforms aimed at quickening the pace of democratization , delivering shared prosperity , and firmly binding Nigeria &apos;s constituent parts into a &quot; more perfect union . &quot; 
Biafra &apos;s attempted secession in 1967 , and the subsequent civil war in which millions died , was triggered by rigged elections , massive official corruption , and the cynical use of ethnicity to achieve political ends . 
The PDP has re-introduced all of these practices since taking power , with the backing of the retreating generals , in 1999 . 
Not surprisingly , secessionist sentiment remains strong . 
The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra ( MASSOB ) , a youth-led militia in the Igbo region that campaigns for the peaceful dissolution of Nigeria , emerged in late 1999 , shortly after Obasanjo , an ethnic Yoruba , took office . 
MASSOB , rightly aggrieved that no real effort has been made by successive Nigerian leaders to tackle the Igbo region &apos;s economic and political problems , is still challenging the central government &apos;s authority in the region . 
The political violence that engulfed several northern states after Buhari &apos;s defeat is part of an emerging trend : narrow ethnic and religious sentiment , fed by feelings of perceived political marginalization and deepening poverty , is increasingly displacing the civic consciousness and active citizen participation that democratic politics should nurture . 
Buhari polled strongly in his home region , and Jonathan did well in southern Nigeria , creating the impression that the country &apos;s dormant fissures are about to erupt . 
Even so , the violence , driven by impoverished northern youth , first targeted the region &apos;s own idle and self-serving rich before degenerating into tit-for-tat attacks between northern Muslims and their Christian counterparts . 
Nor did the violence find purchase in the central North , nominally a part of the &quot; greater &quot; North , whose leaders are now pursuing an independent political project . 
The far-North , some of whose leaders responded , like MASSOB , to Obasanjo &apos;s ascendancy in 1999 by embracing Islamic Sharia law , also needs to be watched carefully . 
Indeed , The Economist drew attention recently to the region &apos;s volatility , with militancy on the rise among the young and attacks on civilians and security forces increasingly common . 
Growing calls by southern political leaders for &quot; true federalism , &quot; if implemented , would significantly reduce the North &apos;s share of the country &apos;s oil revenues , further destabilizing the country unless Jonathan pursues it in a bipartisan and disinterested manner . 
Meanwhile , restive armed youth in the oil-producing delta , Jonathan &apos;s native region , are waiting to see what dividends &quot; our son &quot; will bring to his long-neglected home . 
On the face of it , there is little reason to expect that another four years of incompetent PDP rule will make Nigeria a more stable and prosperous federal state . 
Still , the fact that the post-presidential-election violence was contained , and that the opposition , particularly in the ACN-led Yoruba South-West , is now finding its feet , amounts to a sliver of hope . 
Nations , like democratic politics , take time to form and consolidate . 
Perhaps Nigeria &apos;s just-concluded elections gained for it a small slice of that better future .
