America &apos;s Interest-Rate Puzzle 
A great puzzle in today &apos;s world economy is the continued low level of long-term real interest rates in the United States . 
Conventional macroeconomists like me look at America &apos;s current-account deficit , now running at 7 % of GDP , and know that such vast deficits are inevitably followed by large currency depreciations . 
So we expect a substantial depreciation premium on US interest rates . 
If the dollar falls 20 % more against the euro sometime in the next ten years , US long-term interest rates should be two percentage points higher than euro rates . 
If it falls 40 % against the yen sometime in the next ten years , US long-term interest rates should be four percentage points higher than Japanese rates . 
If it falls 60 % against China &apos;s currency , the yuan , sometime in the next ten years , US long-term interest rates should be six percentage points higher than Chinese rates . 
But we are not seeing signs of anything like this . 
The puzzle is not only that long-term rates are too low when viewed in the international context , but also that they are too low when viewed in America &apos;s domestic context . 
The Bush administration continues to have no plans to sew up the veins it has opened with its medieval economic policy , which holds that bleeding revenue from the government cures all economic problems . 
This means that unless America &apos;s domestic savings rate rises mightily - which it shows no signs of doing - and unless investment expenditure remains abnormally low for the rest of this decade , the supply of loanable funds to finance investment will soon be much less than demand when the current-account deficit narrows to sustainable levels . 
But when supply is less than demand , prices rise sharply . 
In this case , the price of loanable funds is the real interest rate . 
An expectation that interest rates will be high sometime in the next decade should mean high interest rates on long-term bonds today . 
Yet financial markets are not pricing dollar depreciation and a rise in long-term US interest rates accordingly . 
When we macroeconomists talk to our friends on Wall Street , we find that they don &apos;t view this as a puzzle at all . 
On the contrary , they are puzzled about why we view the current low level of US long-term interest rates as worrisome . 
From their perspective , today &apos;s high demand for long-term dollar-denominated securities is easily explained : Asian central banks are buying in order to hold down their currencies , the US Treasury is borrowing short ( and thus not issuing that many long-term securities ) , and US companies are not undertaking the kinds of investments that would lead them to issue many long-term bonds . 
But for every market mispricing there is a profit opportunity : if long-term interest rates are , indeed , too low and long-term bond prices too high , investors will short long-term US bonds , park the money elsewhere , wait for bond prices to return to fundamentals , and then cover their short positions . 
By doing so , they will push prices close to fundamentals today . 
Wall Streeters , however , offer a counterargument : for any financial institution to , say , bet on the decline of the dollar against the yuan over the next five years in a serious , leveraged way is to put its survival at risk should the trades go wrong . 
And trades do go wrong : remember the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management . 
The existence of large financial-market actors that do not care about maximizing their profits magnifies the riskiness of the bets . 
If , say , the Bank of China and the Federal Reserve decided to teach speculators a lesson by pushing the dollar &apos;s value relative to the yuan up by 20 % for a month , they could do so , bankrupting many financial institutions with short positions . 
Similarly , any financial institution that bets on a sharp rise in long-term interest rates over the next five years in a serious , leveraged way also puts its survival at risk . 
For where should they park their money ? 
Only businesses that can borrow long-term now , lock in a low real interest rate , and invest in expanding their capacity can make the domestic bet that interest rates will rise . 
But America &apos;s businesses see enough risk in the future to be wary of getting stuck with unutilized capacity . 
Economists believe that market forces drive prices to fundamentals . 
But we are not careful enough to distinguish situations in which equilibrium-restoring forces are strong from those in which such forces are weak . 
The dollar will fall and US long-term interest rates will rise , but only when traders on Wall Street and elsewhere decide that holding dollars and long-term US bonds is more risky in the short run . 
When that happens , the long-run future will be now .
