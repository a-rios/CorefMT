Central America &apos;s Triangle of Despair 
SAN JOSÉ - During the past five years , some 100,000 unaccompanied migrant children from Guatemala , Honduras , and El Salvador have been apprehended at the southern border of the United States . 
They are a particularly tragic subset of the approximately three million migrants from Central America &apos;s so-called Northern Triangle who have reached the US in the past two decades . 
The roots of this exodus are a tangle of structural problems . 
Weak , fiscally challenged governments , endemic corruption , struggling economics , and high levels of crime have made these three small countries difficult places to live . 
And changing that will likely require assistance from the US . 
While the challenges of the Northern Triangle cannot be addressed through foreign assistance alone , they are unlikely to be overcome without it . 
The feebleness of the region &apos;s governments is a key problem . 
The Northern Triangle has among the lowest tax burdens in the world , at just below 16 % of GDP , which severely limits the ability of its governments to mitigate the impact of their countries &quot; high levels of poverty and inequality . 
This fiscal weakness is compounded by endemic corruption , especially in Guatemala and Honduras . 
Relative to economic size , the fraud recently uncovered in Honduras &quot; social security system dwarfs the massive bribery scandal at Brazil &apos;s Petrobras by a factor of 20 . 
Throughout the Northern Triangle , political interference in judicial processes and regulatory bodies is rife . 
Furthermore , weak states struggle to assert effective control over their territory , a major boon for crime syndicates . 
There is no doubt that the most pressing challenge faced by the region is its extraordinarily high levels of criminality . 
In 2014 , Honduras alone had more homicides than the 28 European Union member states combined . 
Rampant violence can be traced to the pervasive presence of organized crime , particularly drug trafficking . 
Close to 90 % of the cocaine destined for the US travels through Central America . 
The majority of those who leave the Northern Triangle do so for economic reasons . 
Despite efforts by all three countries to open up their economies , their per capita income growth over the past decade has been mediocre at best - leaving the majority of the population mired in poverty or economic vulnerability . 
It is only with remittances from migrants that these economies manage to remain afloat , amounting to 10 % of Guatemala &apos;s GDP and nearly 17 % of El Salvador &apos;s . 
Here , too , Honduras is in the lead , with remittances accounting for 18 % of its economy . 
Tackling the region &apos;s problems will require assistance in several areas . 
In November , the US announced the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle , an initiative intended to create &quot; an economically-integrated Central America ... with strong democratic institutions , with more accountable , transparent , and effective public institutions , and where citizens feel safe and can build their lives in peace and stability . &quot; 
The project is timely and well conceived , embodying the long-term approach that will be essential to bring about structural change and , one hopes , contain migration flows . 
The US Congress should authorize the necessary funding soon . 
In the meantime , the international community needs to support the work of the United Nations International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala . 
Even before the commission played a crucial role in the investigation that led to corruption charges against President Otto Pérez-Molina ( who resigned as a result ) , it had proved its value . 
Its experience provides a blueprint for the design and operation of similar bodies in other countries , most notably Honduras . 
The most important help the international community could give the Northern Triangle is to continue nudging its governments toward structural reforms . 
While it is not clear that the region &apos;s current political elite will prove to be a suitable partner for such an effort , the unprecedented popular mobilization against corruption in Guatemala and Honduras suggests that their newly assertive civil societies could be an important ally . 
The seriousness of the region &apos;s political leaders should be gauged according to two criteria : their readiness to push for robust and progressive tax systems and their sincerity about introducing checks and balances and promoting judicial independence . 
Without the first , the economy will continue to sputter . 
Without the second , any effort to tackle corruption is doomed to fail . 
If external actors , particularly the US , are serious about helping the Northern Triangle , they should not be shy about demanding these two fundamental reforms . 
Central America needs help . 
But only change from within can ensure a future in which the region &apos;s young people choose to build their lives at home .
