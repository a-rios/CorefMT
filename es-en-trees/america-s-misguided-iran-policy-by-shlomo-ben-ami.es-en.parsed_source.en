Why Iran Won &apos;t Budge 
TEL AVIV - No one really believed that the latest round of international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program would produce a breakthrough . 
So it was no surprise that itdid not , despite the concessions that were made at the meeting in Kazakhstan by the P5 + 1 ( China , France , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the United States , plus Germany ) . 
America &apos;s belief that a harsh sanctions regime could coax Iran into a deal has proved - at least so far - to be unrealistic . 
Despite being isolated and ostracized , Iran has managed to gain some strategic breathing room with the help of countries like China , Russia , India , Syria , and Venezuela , allowing it to resist Western pressure . 
More important , even though the severe sanctions regime led by the United States is bound to be imperfect - it only hardens further Iran &apos;s resistance to &quot; America &apos;s designs . &quot; 
To be sure , Iran &apos;s alliances are vulnerable to erosion and , in the case of two staunch allies , Syria and Venezuela , to outright collapse . 
The end of Chavismo would threaten Iran &apos;s vast interests in Venezuela and its considerable presence in the Andes , while the fall of the Assad dynasty would be a devastating blow to Iran &apos;s regional strategy . 
Even so , Russia and China continue to take a much more lenient approach to Iran than Europe and the US have since the International Atomic Energy Agency &apos;s report in November 2011 described in detail Iran &apos;s activities in pursuing the capability to produce nuclear weapons . 
While the Western powers have embraced ever-harsher sanctions , Russia and China view Iran as a tool in their global competition with the US . 
China &apos;s Iranian interests boil down to economics . 
Bilateral trade stands at about $ 40 billion a year , and China is not only Iran &apos;s largest customer for crude oil , but also a colossal investor - somewhere between $ 40 billion and $ 100 billion - in Iran &apos;s energy and transport sectors . 
True , China cannot entirely overlook US pressure and the staunch opposition of its top oil supplier , Saudi Arabia , to Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
But , while China has supported the mandatory sanctions set by the United Nations Security Council , it has rejected the West &apos;s unilateral measures . 
With bilateral trade worth only about $ 5 billion annually , Russia &apos;s economic interests in Iran are fairly modest . 
But it fears Iran &apos;s ability to cause trouble , particularly by stirring up unrest among Russia &apos;s Muslim citizens . 
Moreover , America has refused to pay the Kremlin &apos;s high price - curtailment of congressional human-rights legislation , repeal of Cold-War-era restrictions on Russian-US trade , and abandonment of plans for ballistic missile defense in Europe - for Russian support on Iran ( or , for that matter , on any other trouble spot , such as Syria ) . 
The problem with the US drive to have key stakeholders join its anti-Iran crusade is that some of them live in neighborhoods where Iran is an important factor . 
India is a case in point . 
India is certainly alarmed at the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons , not to mention its concern at the possible effects of Iran &apos;s Islamist fundamentalism on Kashmiri Muslims . 
But its $ 14 billion in annual bilateral trade , and dependence on Iranian oil - many of India &apos;s refineries have been built to run solely on Iranian crude - are key strategic considerations . 
Moreover , India needs Iran as an alternative trade and energy conduit to Central Asia , bypassing rival Pakistan , and also as a hedge against an uncertain future in Afghanistan after America &apos;s withdrawal in 2014 . 
As a result , India &apos;s policy mirrors China &apos;s : it has aligned itself with mandatory international sanctions , but has abjured voluntary Western financial restrictions . 
The best one can expect is that India continues to act at the margin - for example , by reducing dependence on Iranian oil while increasing imports from Saudi Arabia , already its largest supplier of crude . 
The equivocal nature of Iran &apos;s alliances , however , can be a mixed blessing . 
Yes , a harsh sanctions regime might still gain additional supporters , but an Iran with its back against the wall would probably be even more obstinate in its nuclear drive . 
After all , Iraq was an easy target in the first Gulf War precisely because it had abandoned its nuclear program , and possessed no weapons of mass destruction . 
Similarly , Libya &apos;s Muammar el-Qaddafi exposed himself to a NATO onslaught by relinquishing his WMDs . 
By contrast , North Korea shows that defiance , rather than accommodation , is a strategy that works . 
That is why Syria , with North Korean assistance , tried to develop a nuclear program ( presumably destroyed by Israel &apos;s officially unacknowledged &quot; Operation Orchard &quot; in 2007 ) .Iran will not consider abandoning its nuclear insurance policy unless a broad agenda is agreed upon that addresses Iran &apos;s concerns as a regional power and secures the immunity of its Islamist regime from American actions . 
Albert Einstein &apos;s definition of insanity as &quot; doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results &quot; could be applied to America &apos;s Iran policy . 
The diplomacy of sanctions , ostracism , and brinkmanship has failed resoundingly . 
As Iran &apos;s uranium-enrichment and other weapons-development activities continue unabated , the US needs to make a break with the old rules of engagement .
