Democracy in Distress 
PARIS - Is democratic time too slow to respond to crises , and too short to plan for the long term ? 
At a time of deepening economic and social crisis in many of the world &apos;s rich democracies , that question is highly relevant . 
In Italy , for example , Prime Minister Mario Monti has the necessary and legitimate ambition to carry out comprehensive reform . 
He is both competent and honest , but faces a quasi-structural impediment : whereas leaders once had three years to convince voters of their policies &quot; benefits , they now have three hours to convince global financial markets to back their approach . 
Caught between Italian legislators who , deep down , do not understand that change and markets in quest of near-immediate certainties , can Monti transcend his natural prudence and act with sufficient clarity and decisiveness ? 
In the United States , too , the political system is becoming increasingly dysfunctional . 
The political philosopher Francis Fukuyama goes so far as to say that &quot; vetocracy &quot; could triumph over democracy , regardless of who wins the 2012 presidential election . 
The separation of powers , a principle established by the US founders under the influence of philosophers such as Montesquieu , is leading today to near-paralysis . 
Democracies suffer not only from their slow reaction time at moments of crisis , but also from the difficulty that they face in projecting themselves into the future and planning for the long term . 
On both sides of the Atlantic , political leaders know what they must do for their countries , but don &apos;t know how to get re-elected if they actually do it . 
They seem to be structurally condemned to short-termism . 
But it is not because democracies have a &quot; time problem &quot; that their era seems to some to be over . 
China is rightly proud to be able to project itself into the twenty-second century . 
Chinese think long term because they are Chinese , not because they are not democrats . 
China &apos;s leaders can , of course , react to events without much regard for Chinese public opinion . 
After all , the great majority of Chinese do not dream of democracy , even if something like a civil society is emerging , generating new interests and demands that can no longer be totally controlled or manipulated , as in the past . 
But that is precisely the weakness of non-democratic regimes in a global age dominated by transparency : Who dreams of becoming a Chinese citizen , or even a citizen of Singapore ? 
In the aftermath of North Korea &apos;s hereditary succession , strategic thinkers rightly emphasize China &apos;s key role in shaping the peninsula &apos;s future . 
The majority of Chinese may not want to be governed like Westerners , but it would be wrong to assume that their only ambition is to spend like Westerners . 
The more successful they are , the more individualistic they will become and the more they will expect the respect and consideration of those who govern them . 
By contrast , if China &apos;s economic growth slows , which is likely in the coming years , protest against corruption - a source of fragility for any regime - will escalate . 
Indeed , it is important to bear in mind that , ahead of the upcoming Chinese leadership transition , new occupants for only the top two posts have been chosen , and that through a process of gradual anointment by roughly a hundred people at most . 
The current crisis in the advanced countries , which may very well lead to a global recession ( if it is not already doing so ) , not only reveals the many maladies of democratic regimes , but also acts as their incubator and accelerator . 
We see this in mounting unrest in both Russia and China . 
Contrary to what one might think , democracy is more resilient than the alternatives in the long run . 
This will remain true as long as democrats remain convinced of it . 
Non-democratic models cannot truly challenge democracy . 
Only the misbehavior of democrats can do that .
