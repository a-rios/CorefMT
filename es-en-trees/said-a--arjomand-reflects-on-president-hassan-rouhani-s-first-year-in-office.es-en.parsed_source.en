Remaking Iran 
TEHRAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani recently marked the end of his first year in office not only with smiles , but also with further evidence of his efforts at domestic reform and geostrategic reorientation . 
In Iran &apos;s case , these two imperatives have long gone hand in hand . 
Rouhani now says that Iran would be willing to work with the United States in Iraq . 
The dire threat to both Iranian and US interests posed by the Islamic State ( formerly the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ) has , evidently , brought the two countries closer together . 
In the days since the anniversary of Rouhani &apos;s election , Iran &apos;s foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , overcame his earlier reservations and expressed optimism about reaching an international deal on his country &apos;s nuclear program by the original deadline of July 20 . 
If rapprochement with the West can be achieved , the removal of the international sanctions stemming from the nuclear program would give a tremendous boost to Rouhani &apos;s economic policy . 
Coming into office , Rouhani had a clear priority : fix an economy devastated by eight years of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s demagogic mismanagement . 
He replaced Ahmadinejad &apos;s incompetent thugs with a reasonably qualified cabinet and capable administrators , and has embarked on an ambitious program of economic development , expanded health care , and environmental protection . 
Though Rouhani has made little headway combating rampant inflation , small business and the entrepreneurial middle class seem to be thriving . 
In early June , I found a recently opened complex of expensive restaurants opposite the new luxury Grand Hotel in Shiraz packed with affluent customers . 
Rouhani is vigorously cultivating economic ties with Gulf states , including Kuwait , whose ruler he entertained in Tehran in early June before leaving on an official visit to Turkey , where he signed ten deals aimed at doubling bilateral trade , to $ 30 billion , in 2015 . 
On the environmental front , Rouhani is also busy undoing his predecessor &apos;s damage . 
Tehran &apos;s air pollution , widely blamed by those with respiratory illness on low-octane &quot; Ahmadinejad gasoline , &quot; has visibly declined with the introduction of high-octane fuel and other restrictions . 
Last but not least , Rouhani has launched his national health-insurance program , and ordered state hospitals , which dominate the health sector , to limit patients &quot; copayments for all medical expenses to 10 % . 
Rouhani has made it clear that he wants to pay for the new health care by phasing out the monthly state stipends paid to more than seventy-four million registered citizens , which Ahmadinejad offered when he eliminated a wide range of subsidies . 
The strongest factor working in Rouhani &apos;s favor is the support of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the country &apos;s Supreme Leader , for the president &apos;s domestic policies - just as he has fully backed the nuclear negotiations . 
Unlike Ahmadinejad &apos;s reformist predecessor , Mohammad Khatami , who acted more like the leader of the loyal opposition than head of the executive , Rouhani has worked closely with Khamenei . 
In his speech to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini &apos;s death on June 4 , Khamenei fully appropriated the discourse of the dissident clerics aligned with Khatami . 
Thus , he described the regime instituted by Khomeini as a religious democracy in which all high state offices , including his own , derive their legitimacy from the will of the people as expressed in elections . 
But Rouhani needs more than Khamenei &apos;s backing . 
With Mohammad Reza Mahdavi Kani , the 83-year-old chairman of the Council of Experts ( the body of clerics that elects the supreme leader ) gravely ill , Ghorbanali Dorri-Najafabadi , an influential member and former intelligence and security minister , has suggested that the Council should proceed to elect Khamenei &apos;s successor now . 
Clearly , the clerical elite is concerned about the future of its leadership after Khamenei . 
Should a succession process begin soon , it would significantly constrain Rouhani &apos;s room for maneuver . 
Rouhani &apos;s relations with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) and other security forces are of more immediate concern . 
Last month &apos;s unceremonious killing of a billionaire businessman detained by security forces on corruption charges seemed to reflect the tacit division of power between the president and Iran &apos;s security apparatus . 
Nonetheless , tension is simmering beneath the surface . 
Rouhani seems to have halted the expansion of the IRGC &apos;s economic empire . 
The IRGC &apos;s commander , General Mohammad Ali Jafari , has publicly expressed his hostility to Rouhani &apos;s administration , while General Hassan Firouzabadi , Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces , has countered by expressing his support for the president . 
It is in Iraq , however , that Iran faces its most complicated mix of challenge and opportunity . 
Determined to prevent the disintegration of the country , Iran has provided military and political support to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki &apos;s government . 
Rouhani &apos;s circle is fully prepared to address this crisis by talking to the US . 
After a year in power , Rouhani &apos;s program of economic development , environmental cleanup , and improved health care is proceeding smoothly and quietly . 
Much depends on whether a nuclear deal with the international community is achieved , and the likelihood of that outcome has unexpectedly increased , owing to the common interest of Iran and the US in coping with the collapse of Iraq .
