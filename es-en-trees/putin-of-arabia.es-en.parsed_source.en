Putin of Arabia 
BEIRUT - Almost undetected , Russia is regaining much of the influence that it lost in the Middle East after the Soviet Union collapsed . 
Ever since Russia invaded Georgia in August , Arab satellite television and Web sites have been rife with talk about the region &apos;s role in an emerging &quot; new Cold War . &quot; 
Is the Arab world &apos;s Cold War patron really back , and , if so , what will it mean for peace in the region ? 
With the USSR &apos;s demise , communist ideology , which Muslims believe contradicts their faith , ended too . 
Communism never stopped Arab regimes opposed by the United States from accepting arms supplies from the Soviet-era Russians , but it did prevent Russia from securing the kind of intimate influence that America had secured with its regional allies . 
Now , even Islamists are welcoming Russia back as a regional player in order to strengthen their struggle against American hegemony , conveniently forgetting Russia &apos;s brutal suppression of Chechen Muslims during the 1990 &quot; s . 
This is a complete reversal of the pattern that prevailed in the 1950 &quot; s . 
Back then , the US encouraged Islam as a bulwark against communism . 
Its allies in the Middle East , especially Saudi Arabia , justified US influence on the grounds that Americans were Christian and thus part of the Ahl el-Kitab ( the people of the Book ) . 
The Soviets were regularly attacked as dangerous enemies of God . 
Today , US power in the Middle East is at its historical nadir , and Russia is seeking to fill the vacuum . 
Even America &apos;s closest allies - Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and Israel - are vulnerable as they face the aggressive expansion of &quot; radical forces &quot; represented by Iran , Hamas , Hezbollah , Syria , and the Iraqi resistance . 
In the prevailing atmosphere of turmoil and confusion , the radical Islamists attack the Americans as barbarous Crusaders who have replaced the communists as the enemies of Islam . 
Indeed , for the conservative majority in the region , the US , with is pop culture and liberal democracy , is seen as a far more problematic ally than the autocratic and wealth-loving Russians . 
Russia &apos;s inroads in the region began with former President Vladimir Putin &apos;s state visit to Iran in October 2007 - the first visit by a Russian leader since Stalin &apos;s trip to Teheran in 1943 . 
Russia , of course , helped Iran kick off its nuclear program , and has often defended the Iranian regime from stiffer United Nations sanctions . 
Russia views its relations with Iran as a means to leverage its diplomatic influence in the wider Middle East , where the US has sought ( successfully ) to marginalize the Kremlin since the Cold War &apos;s end . 
Russia &apos;s other aim has been to exempt from UN sanctions the Bushehr nuclear reactor that it has been building for Iran . 
A full UN-sponsored financial squeeze on Iran would jeopardize Russia &apos;s profits from providing nuclear fuel for the reactor , which is due to be commissioned soon . 
Indeed , for the first time in Russia &apos;s history in the Middle East , it can depend on genuinely powerful local allies . 
The Soviet Union lost Egypt in 1972 , and its naval bases in Syria were abandoned in 1989 . 
Now , Russia has signed strategic agreements with Iran and is reconstructing military bases in Syria in response to an appeal by President Bashar Al-Assad ( who visited Moscow in a brazen bid for Kremlin support just after the Georgian war ended ) . 
Iran &apos;s regime is eager to publicize its partnerships with Russia , and to make concessions to it in order to face the American and Israeli threat and to gain more time to pursue its nuclear program . Hamas , too , is proud of its Russian connections , so much so that it was one of only three regimes in the world to recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , the regions that Russia has helped break away from Georgia . 
In response to America &apos;s failed policies in the Middle East , whether in Iraq , Iran , Syria , Lebanon , or Palestine , Russia appears to be using its oil-fired wealth to knit together a new bloc to counter the US presence . 
Even in Iraq , Russia is making headway . 
It has written off some $ 12 billion in debt dating from Saddam and is pushing to create an Iraq-Syria oil pipeline , which will further its bid to control much of the transport of oil and gas . 
Russia is also ready and willing to provide more developed weapons to Syria and Iran . 
In the short term Russia armed with high oil prices has nothing to lose but in the long term , Russia &apos;s policy in the Middle East appears to be doubly misguided . 
A nuclear-armed Iran on its doorstep is certainly not in Russia &apos;s national interest , particularly given the increasing radicalization of Russia &apos;s own 20 million Muslim citizens - the only part of its population that is actually growing . 
Indeed , Iran was a keen backer of the Chechen separatists that Russia spent almost a decade fighting to put down . 
With Muslims becoming a bigger factor in Russian domestic politics in the decades ahead , it may be wise for Russia to take an interest in Middle East affairs . 
But strengthening the hands of the region &apos;s most radical elements will only empower them to turn their attention one day to the &quot; oppressed &quot; Muslims of Russia .
