America &apos;s Suicidal Statecraft 
Since its victory in the Cold War , America &apos;s global hegemony has rested on three pillars : economic power , military might , and a vast capacity to export its popular culture . 
The recent emergence of additional powers - the European Union , China , India , and a Russia driven to recover its lost status - has eroded America &apos;s capacity to shape events unilaterally . 
Even so , America remains by far the world &apos;s most powerful country ; its decline has more to do with its incompetent use of power than with the emergence of competitors . 
It is American leaders &quot; &quot; suicidal statecraft , &quot; to use Arnold Toynbee &apos;s pithy phrase for what he considered the ultimate cause of imperial collapse , that is to blame for America &apos;s plight . 
Consider the Middle East . 
Nothing reveals the decline of the United States in the region better than the contrast between America &apos;s sober use of power in the first Gulf War in 1991 and the hubris and deceit of today &apos;s Iraq war . 
In 1991 , America forged the most formidable international coalition since World War II , and led it in a fully legitimate war aimed at restoring regional balance after Saddam Hussein &apos;s invasion of Kuwait . 
In 2003 , America went to war without its trans-Atlantic allies after manipulating false assertions . 
In doing so , the US embarked on a preposterous grand strategy that aimed no less at simultaneously dismantling Iraq &apos;s tyrannical regime , restructuring the entire Middle East , destroying al-Qaeda , and helping democracy to take root throughout the Arab world . 
The result has been utter failure : military defeat and a severe degradation of America &apos;s moral standing . 
Rather than undermining radical Islam , the US has legitimized it , in Iraq and beyond . 
Indeed , what will now shape the future of the region is not democracy , but the violent divide between Shiites and Sunnis that the Iraq war precipitated . 
It is this Muslim civil war that is allowing al-Qaeda to gain a larger pool of recruits . 
With Iraq probably becoming the first Arab country to be ruled by Shiites , and hence integrated into an expanding Shiite Iranian empire , America &apos;s Sunni allies in the region now view the US as unreliable . 
Indeed , the US is seen as practically complicit in inciting a monumental reversal of Islam &apos;s fortunes , the Shia revival . 
Nor is the gospel of democracy especially dear to America &apos;s Arab allies , for the call to democratize has only emboldened the Islamists to challenge the incumbent elites for power . 
Admittedly , violent Islamic fundamentalism has deeper roots in the fading promise of Arab nationalism . 
But America &apos;s misbegotten democratic message has ended up alienating both its conservative regional allies , as it gave a new lease on life to political Islam , which can use the ballot box as a route to power , and the Islamists , whose electoral gains are then rejected by the US . 
America &apos;s biggest strategic blunder in the Middle East arguably concerns the emergence of Iranian power . 
By destroying Iraq as a counterbalancing regional force , the US dealt a major blow to its traditional Gulf allies , for whom Iraq served as a barrier against Iran &apos;s ambitions . 
America offered Iran on a silver platter strategic assets that Khomeini &apos;s revolution failed to acquire either in eight years of war against Saddam or in its abortive attempts to export the Islamic revolution throughout the region . 
Likewise , Iran &apos;s nuclear program gained momentum thanks to its sense of impunity following the colossal failure in Iraq of America &apos;s concept of &quot; preventive war . &quot; 
The calamitous US military experience in Iraq has left it strategically diminished . 
Iraq has now become God &apos;s playground , and America can hope to achieve a modicum of stability there only with the help of other regional powers . 
Nevertheless , the US will remain the most influential external actor in the Middle East , for its failure is one of leadership , not of actual power . 
Humbled by military defeat , America can recover its regional relevance only by avoiding the sin of hubris , and learning to lead without attempting to dominate . 
This requires engaging revolutionary forces like Iran and Syria ; respecting , rather than ostracizing , those Islamist movements that have opted out from jihadism in favor of political participation ; and leading an international alliance for an Arab-Israeli peace based on the Arab League initiative . 
Indeed , the paradox of America &apos;s pernicious policies in Iraq is that they have created favorable conditions for an Arab-Israeli peace , as the emergence of Iran and the threat of a fundamentalist tsunami have focused Arab minds on the urgency of a settlement with Israel . 
The Palestinian issue is not the source of all the Middle East &apos;s ills , but its resolution would dramatically improve America &apos;s standing among Arabs . 
More importantly , it would deny Iran the ability to link popular Islamic and Arab causes with its own hegemonic ambitions .
