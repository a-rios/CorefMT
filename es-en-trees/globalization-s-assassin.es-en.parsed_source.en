Globalization &apos;s Assassin 
The world &apos;s first wave of economic globalization , led by the British Empire in the nineteenth century , came to an end literally with a bang on a Sunday afternoon in 1914 , when Gavrilo Princip killed ( with two uncannily well-aimed bullets ) Austria &apos;s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife . 
The years that followed witnessed pan-European carnage , instability throughout the 1920 &quot; s , and the rise of fascism and communism , culminating in the death of countless millions during World War II . 
Is today &apos;s globalizing era also coming to an end ? 
If so , it may not necessarily end with a repeat of the slaughters of the last century , but with an economic retrenchment that brings economic stagnation and consigns billions of people to grinding poverty . 
Various candidates have been proposed for the role of globalization &apos;s assassin . 
But one little noticed , yet likely , aspirant has been sneaking up on the world economy : the growing tendency to limit the free circulation of people , to &quot; fence in &quot; the rich world . 
We see the menace of this tendency constantly nowadays , but we perceive it in such a seemingly unthreatening way that we may well become accustomed to it rather than arresting it . 
Globalization means free movement of capital , goods , technology , ideas , and , yes , people . 
Any globalization that is limited to the first three or four freedoms but omits the last one is partial and not sustainable . 
As soon as people cannot move , there will be little to stop governments from limiting the free movement of goods or other factors of production . 
After all , if over-populated countries with high unemployment cannot export people , why not reach for higher tariff barriers to protect the jobs they have ? 
But what of the unemployed who become locked into their societies ? 
The war on terror has shown us the dangers that can arise from the social frustrations that often result . 
Nevertheless , the &quot; fencing-in &quot; of the rich world continues apace . 
The United States plans to construct a veritable &quot; Mexican Wall &quot; to keep poor people from crossing into Texas or California . 
Likewise , hundreds , if not thousands , of Africans die every year trying to reach the shores of Fortress Europe . 
Efforts to restrict people &apos;s movement between countries expose the soft underbelly of globalization : the deepening gap between countries &quot; mean incomes . 
Rather than poor countries growing faster than the rich ( as we would expect from Economics 101 ) , mainly the reverse is true . 
Between 1980 and 2002 , average annual per capita income growth in the rich world ( defined as the &quot; old &quot; OECD members ) was almost 2 % , compared to just 0.1 % in the 42 least developed countries . 
Indeed , average income in Latin America is now barely above its 1980 level . 
This huge gap spurs migration . 
People nowadays know much more about conditions in different countries than they did in the past , and if moving across a border means that their income can be multiplied several-fold , they will try to do it . 
This is why today &apos;s most contentious borders separate economies where the income gaps between people on the two sides are the greatest . 
There are four such global hot spots : the borders between the US and Mexico , Spain and Morocco , Greece ( and Italy ) and the southern Balkans , and Indonesia and Singapore ( or Malaysia ) . 
The income gaps range from more than seven to one in the latter case to 4.5 to one in the case of Spain and Morocco , 4.3 to one between the US and Mexico , and four to one between Greece and Albania . 
Income differences were not always so huge . 
In 1980 , average income in the US was a little more than three times that of Mexico , the gap between Singapore and Indonesia was 5.3 to one , and the difference between Spain and Morocco 3.5 to one . 
Even the gap between Greece and Albania , at three to one , was narrower than it is now . 
So income gaps between all these contiguous countries have increased significantly during the last quarter-century . 
So it is little wonder that it is in these places that most illegal immigration and human trafficking occurs - pirates in the Straits of Malacca , fast boats between Albania and Italy , and desperate human cargoes from Africa and Latin America . 
If today &apos;s globalization continues to widen income gaps , the waves of migration will grow . 
So the rich world will , in a knee-jerk response , erect ever-higher barriers to stem the human tide . 
If globalization , which has so enriched the world &apos;s wealthiest countries , is to continue , governments must find ways to increase incomes more evenly . 
Otherwise , today &apos;s &quot; fencing in &quot; of the rich world will increase the risk of a backlash against free circulation of goods and capital , as well as of political instability punctuated by terrorism . 
Global income redistribution by the rich countries should be viewed as a matter not of charity , but of enlightened self-interest .
