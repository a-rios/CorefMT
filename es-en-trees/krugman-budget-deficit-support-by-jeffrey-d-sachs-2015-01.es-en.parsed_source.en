Paul Krugman and the Obama Recovery 
NEW YORK - For several years , and often several times a month , the Nobel laureate economist and New York Times columnist and blogger Paul Krugman has delivered one main message to his loyal readers : deficit-cutting &quot; austerians &quot; ( as he calls advocates of fiscal austerity ) are deluded . 
Fiscal retrenchment amid weak private demand would lead to chronically high unemployment . 
Indeed , deficit cuts would court a reprise of 1937 , when Franklin D. Roosevelt prematurely reduced the New Deal stimulus and thereby threw the United States back into recession . 
Well , Congress and the White House did indeed play the austerian card from mid-2011 onward . 
The federal budget deficit has declined from 8.4 % of GDP in 2011 to a predicted 2.9 % of GDP for all of 2014 . 
And , according to the International Monetary Fund , the structural deficit ( sometimes called the &quot; full-employment deficit &quot; ) , a measure of fiscal stimulus , has fallen from 7.8 % of potential GDP to 4 % of potential GDP from 2011 to 2014 . 
Krugman has vigorously protested that deficit reduction has prolonged and even intensified what he repeatedly calls a &quot; depression &quot; ( or sometimes a &quot; low-grade depression &quot; ) . 
Only fools like the United Kingdom &apos;s leaders ( who reminded him of the Three Stooges ) could believe otherwise . 
Yet , rather than a new recession , or an ongoing depression , the US unemployment rate has fallen from 8.6 % in November 2011 to 5.8 % in November 2014 . 
Real economic growth in 2011 stood at 1.6 % , and the IMF expects it to be 2.2 % for 2014 as a whole . 
GDP in the third quarter of 2014 grew at a vigorous 5 % annual rate , suggesting that aggregate growth for all of 2015 will be above 3 % . 
So much for Krugman &apos;s predictions . 
Not one of his New York Times commentaries in the first half of 2013 , when &quot; austerian &quot; deficit cutting was taking effect , forecast a major reduction in unemployment or that economic growth would recover to brisk rates . 
On the contrary , &quot; the disastrous turn toward austerity has destroyed millions of jobs and ruined many lives , &quot; he argued , with the US Congress exposing Americans to &quot; the imminent threat of severe economic damage from short-term spending cuts . &quot; 
As a result , &quot; Full recovery still looks a very long way off , &quot; he warned . 
&quot; And I &apos;m beginning to worry that it may never happen . &quot; 
I raise all of this because Krugman took a victory lap in his end-of-2014 column on &quot; The Obama Recovery . &quot; 
The recovery , according to Krugman , has come not despite the austerity he railed against for years , but because we &quot; seem to have stopped tightening the screws : Public spending isn &apos;t surging , but at least it has stopped falling . 
And the economy is doing much better as a result . &quot; 
That is an incredible claim . 
The budget deficit has been brought down sharply , and unemployment has declined . 
Yet Krugman now says that everything has turned out just as he predicted . 
In fact , Krugman has been conflating two distinct ideas as if both were components of &quot; progressive &quot; thinking . 
On one hand , he has been the &quot; conscience of a liberal , &quot; rightly focusing on how government can combat poverty , poor health , environmental degradation , rising inequality , and other social ills . 
I admire that side of Krugman &apos;s writing , and , as I wrote in my book The Price of Civilization , I agree with him . 
On the other hand , Krugman has inexplicably taken up the mantle of crude aggregate-demand management , making it seem that favoring large budget deficits in recent years is also part of progressive economics . 
( Krugman &apos;s position is sometimes called Keynesianism , but John Maynard Keynes knew much better than Krugman that we should not depend on mechanistic &quot; demand multipliers &quot; to set the unemployment rate . ) 
Deficits were not increased enough in 2009 to escape from high unemployment , he insisted , and were falling dangerously fast after 2010 . 
Obviously , recent trends - a significant decline in the unemployment rate and a reasonably high and accelerating rate of economic growth - cast doubt on Krugman &apos;s macroeconomic diagnosis ( though not on his progressive politics ) . 
And the same trends have been apparent in the United Kingdom , where Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s government has cut the structural budget deficit from 8.4 % of potential GDP in 2010 to 4.1 % in 2014 , while the unemployment rate has fallen from 7.9 % when Cameron took office to 6 % , according to the most recent data for the fall of 2014 . 
To be clear , I believe that we do need more government spending as a share of GDP - for education , infrastructure , low-carbon energy , research and development , and family benefits for low-income families . 
But we should pay for this through higher taxes on high incomes and high net worth , a carbon tax , and future tolls collected on new infrastructure . 
We need the liberal conscience , but without the chronic budget deficits . 
There is nothing progressive about large budget deficits and a rising debt-to-GDP ratio . 
After all , large deficits have no reliable effect on reducing unemployment , and deficit reduction can be consistent with falling unemployment . 
Krugman is a great economic theorist - and a great polemicist . 
But he should replace his polemical hat with his analytical one and reflect more deeply on recent experience : deficit-cutting accompanied by recovery , job creation , and lower unemployment . 
This should be an occasion for him to rethink his long-standing macroeconomic mantra , rather than claiming vindication for ideas that recent trends seem to contradict .
