Ukraine &apos;s Dollar Addiction 
KYIV - Inflation in Ukraine is skyrocketing . 
By March , it reached 26 % per year and continues to rise . 
Although prices are increasing around the world , Ukraine &apos;s inflation is extreme , twice as much as in neighboring Russia . 
Amazingly , instead of dampening inflation , Ukraine &apos;s central bank is stoking it . 
Ukraine &apos;s prices started spiraling out of control around the time when Yuliya Tymoshenko returned as prime minister last December . 
Malicious observers suggest that she is to blame for pursuing populist social expenditures . 
Her government actually tightened the budget just before New Year . 
Indeed , Finance Minister Viktor Pynzenyk reports that the state recorded a budget surplus of 0.6 % of GDP during the first quarter of 2008 . 
This is not surprising , because state revenues expand with rising prices , while expenditures are largely fixed . 
But Tymoshenko &apos;s government has , in reality , done a solid fiscal job . 
State finances are generally in good shape , with public debt at just 11 % of GDP . 
According to the National Bank of Ukraine ( NBU ) , international reserves have grown steadily and now stand at $ 33 billion . 
The real cause of Ukraine &apos;s inflation is that its currency , the hryvnia , remains pegged to the US dollar . 
When the dollar falls in value , as it has , Ukraine &apos;s very open economy imports inflation . 
In the last year , the dollar &apos;s value dropped by 12 % against the euro , which is a more important currency than the dollar in Ukraine &apos;s foreign trade . 
The International Monetary Fund has persistently warned Ukraine that its dollar peg could cause a financial crisis because of over- or undervaluation , and for years has called on Ukraine to free its exchange rate . 
But the NBU refused to do so - making Ukraine the last country in Central and Eastern Europe to tie its currency to the dollar . 
Ukraine &apos;s powerful industrialists praised the NBU &apos;s low exchange-rate policy , believing it makes the country more competitive . 
They ignore the fact that the NBU can control only the nominal appreciation of the hryvnia . 
But costs are determined by the real revaluation , which is the sum of exchange-rate changes and inflation . 
The dollar peg has also forced the NBU to pursue a loose monetary policy . 
Ukraine &apos;s current refinance rate is 16 % a year , 10 % less than inflation , which means that Ukraine has a negative real interest rate of 10 % a year . 
As a result , Ukraine &apos;s money supply , M3 , exploded by no less than 52 % in the last year , which points to inflation hitting 30 % soon . 
The NBU &apos;s leadership understands that it must act to contain inflation , but its insistence on the dollar peg ties their hands , because it prevents them from raising interest rates sufficiently . 
Instead , they have reverted to strict reserve requirements , effectively rationing credit and thereby causing a domestic credit squeeze in the midst of the current international financial crisis , which is likely to force some medium-sized banks into bankruptcy because of liquidity problems . 
Rationing is always worse than a market . 
Why does the NBU persist with this harmful policy ? 
Incompetence is one reason , but politics is probably the decisive cause . 
The NBU is subordinate to President Viktor Yushchenko , who , despite naming Tymoshenko as prime minister , seems more interested in harming her politically than in capping inflation . 
The flaws in the NBU &apos;s policy are so obvious it will be forced to free the exchange rate , but it might act too late . 
Even now , in the midst of an inflationary crisis , the NBU wants to move in small steps , evidently failing to grasp the severity of the crisis . 
The NBU needs to announce that it no longer has an exchange-rate target and that it will stop intervening by ending its purchases of dollars on the currency market . 
If the NBU lets the exchange rate float , Ukrainians are likely to exchange billions of dollars into hryvnia , driving up the hryvnia exchange rate . 
That would contain Ukraine &apos;s inflation , as the NBU could restrict the money supply through high interest rates rather than rationing . 
Time is short . 
The great economist Rudi Dornbusch used to say that a financial crisis usually starts much later than anyone expects , but then develops faster than anyone can imagine . 
Ukraine is on the financial precipice . 
Yushchenko and the NBU can still act , but if they do not do so immediately , a costly and unnecessary financial crisis might ensue . 
As prime minister , Yushchenko saved his country from financial default in early 2000 . 
Ukraine &apos;s well-being must not be sacrificed to his political ambitions .
