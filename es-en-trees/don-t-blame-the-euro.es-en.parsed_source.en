Don &apos;t Blame The Euro 
Who &apos;s he kidding ? 
Maroni &apos;s nostalgia for the lira is little more than a transparent -  and irresponsible -  election ploy by Italy &apos;s Northern League , an attempt to divert blame for the country &apos;s present economic troubles onto Romano Prodi , former EU Commission president and center left candidate in the forthcoming general elections . 
A return to the lira would be &quot; economic suicide &quot; for Italy according to ECB chief economist Otmar Issing . 
The euro has made Italian government bonds as good as German government bonds , because the ECB is willing to accept both on an equal basis as collateral for ECB loans . 
Has the Italian minister thought for a minute how his government would pay for all its public spending on welfare , and other items , if Italy &apos;s interest rates no longer were subsidized by the ECB ? 
Perhaps Maroni wants to go back to the lira so that Italy can de-value it . 
The euro stops countries like France and Italy from playing their old protectionist game of devaluing their currencies at German expense . 
Because of this , the competitive advantages Germany recently gained from its economic reforms are being protected by the euro from offsetting currency devaluations inside the euro-zone . 
This is good news . 
Improved competitiveness facilitated by the euro bodes well for Germany &apos;s medium term economic prospects . 
The German public - hungry for economic recovery and tired of excuses  -  has not been fooled by the euro and ECB bashing of its present government , and handed German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder a decisive defeat in the recent North Rhine-Westphalia elections . 
( Had they been fooled , perhaps they would have been more forgiving . ) 
Jacques Chirac  -  another of Europe &apos;s great euro and ECB bashers  -  also suffered a severe personal reversal at the polls when the French rejected the EU Constitution . 
The public seems to be saying to the on-their-way-out leaders of the Franco-German alliance : Stop the excuses , and start getting our economies working again . 
Does anyone really believe the French would have voted No had France &apos;s economic growth rates been double or triple their current levels ? 
The same is true in the Netherlands where the EU Constitution was also rejected . 
Unlike the French , however , the Dutch have not been euro bashers even though , as a medium sized country , the Netherlands do have some legitimate grievances against the EU - namely , how the so-called &quot; Stability Pact &quot; to control fiscal deficits is being enforced . 
Holland has played by the stability pact rules but , so far , the big countries  -  France , Italy and Germany -  have been getting a free pass from the responsible authorities . 
This is neither fair nor smart  -  and no doubt contributed , to some extent , to the Dutch No vote . 
France , on the other hand , has been the beneficiary of this discrimination - yet it bashes the euro and votes No into the bargain . 
The good news for Europe is that the big country politicians - Schroeder in Germany , Chirac in France and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy - all are on the way out . 
The path will soon be clear for a new set of leaders to get Europe &apos;s economic growth engines going again . 
The bad news is that all three politicians are lame ducks unlikely to undertake the reforms Europe so badly needs before their final goodbyes . 
This is a point made most recently by former ECB president Wim Duisenberg in a CNN interview  -  Europe must wait before its dormant growth engine re-ignites . 
In the meantime , the euro has come down in the foreign exchanges , and there has been scare talk in some quarters  -  correctly labeled as &quot; absurd &quot; by Otmar Issing and Bundesbank president Axel Weber  -  that the &quot; European project &quot; is in danger . 
As the currency declined , Asian central banks have been seen buying euros hand over fist to bolster their euro reserve assets . 
Smart money is buying the euro - not bashing it .
