Trick or Treat ? 
OXFORD - A new way of thinking about individual choice has taken the political landscape by storm . America &apos;s new president Barack Obama and the leader of the British Conservatives , David Cameron ( just to drop a couple of names ) have shown an interest in it . 
Its intellectual and academic pedigree is impeccable . 
It is said to be effective , evidence-based , and cheap to implement . 
Most of all , it stakes a claim to a degree of philosophical coherence of which the various &quot; third ways &quot; of the last decade could only dream . 
The novel idea , elucidated in Cass Sunstein &apos;s and Richard Thaler &apos;s book Nudge , is that skillfully controlling the way alternatives are presented to us can &quot; nudge &quot; us toward making the choices that our own &quot; better selves &quot; would make . 
&quot; Libertarian paternalists &quot; like Sunstein and Thaler claim that we have two different ways of making decisions : one &quot; from the gut &quot; ( called System I ) , and the other more deliberative and far more effective ( called System II ) . 
But , while System II choices may be more effective than System-I decisions , they are more &quot; expensive &quot; to make : one needs data , analysis , and concentration . 
Only when the importance of the task warrants the effort do we shift gear and deploy the System-II heavy artillery . 
This division of labor between the System-I and System-II mechanisms would work well were it not for the fact that our lazy and cheap decision-making mode tends to take over in situations that should command our fullest attention : choosing a pension plan or a health care scheme , for example . 
As one can imagine , the results of this System-I coup d &apos;etat are not pretty . 
Old-fashioned paternalists have always been very well aware of this . 
In these situations , liberal paternalists feel no qualms about taking control and forcing choices upon us ( &quot; Wear seat belts and enroll in the pension plan , and in the end you &apos;ll thank me &quot; ) . 
The criticisms of this attitude boil down to a simple question : &quot; Who is better equipped than I am to make choices about my welfare ? &quot; 
Libertarian paternalists are different . 
To make us choose what is good for us , they avoid fines , compulsion , and prohibition in favor of &quot; nudges &quot; - institutional arrangements that we could , in principle , easily override , but that , given our tendency to rely on System I , we end up going along with . 
With a neat twist of logic , our cognitive imperfections are turned on their heads , and made to work to achieve System-II choices . 
And , indeed , well-chosen nudges have been shown to be extremely effective in altering choices that make a substantive difference to the lives of many ( say , enrollment in pension plans ) . 
But here lies the rub : if the architecture of choice is truly so important in determining outcomes , does it really matter if manipulation rather than coercion is used to make us choose what someone else has decided is ultimately good for us ? 
What is gained by tricking rather than forcing people into making choices they wouldn &apos;t have made ? 
Isn &apos;t the power of the manipulator more insidious , and perhaps to be more greatly feared , than that of the policeman ? 
In short , what is so libertarian about &quot; nudging &quot; ? 
Libertarian paternalists offer a novel answer to these questions . 
As long as choice engineering tricks us into making choices that our own more deliberate self would make , they say , manipulation is justifiable . 
Nudges should be so chosen as to prod us toward those choices that we ourselves would make , if we would only sit down and think carefully about the matter at hand . 
There are , unfortunately , some logical problems with this apparently elegant solution . 
Is it really always so reasonable and effective to listen to System-II preferences ? 
According to neo-classical economists , the answer is a resounding &quot; yes , &quot; and , in many cases , they can point to substantial evidence to validate their claim . 
Unfortunately , however , hyper-rationality does not always produce attractive outcomes when social , rather than individual , choices are concerned . 
Indeed , sometimes it leads to results that are inefficient , &quot; nasty , &quot; or both . 
The benefits of tax evasion may far outweigh the risk of getting caught , but imagine if everyone decided to evade taxes at the same time . 
In these situations , the System-II decision maker has no tools to resort to in order to escape the sub-optimality ( and social nastiness ) of the rational decision . 
It gets worse . 
Consider the following example . 
I am an organ donor . 
Thaler and Sunstein also believe that donating organs is a good thing . 
Therefore , one of the &quot; nudges &quot; they recommend is to make organ donation as the default option in the case of a fatal accident . 
But there is nothing irrational in having a very strong preference not to have one &apos;s body used for spare parts after one &apos;s death . 
We cannot use System II to fault this preference . 
How would we feel if we used the System-I decisional laziness about changing defaults to &quot; trick &quot; someone into a course of action to which she would have violently objected , perhaps on religious grounds ? 
Ultimately , there is a fundamental and unresolved accountability deficit in the way libertarian paternalists go about nudging us . 
The Enlightenment idea that our System-II rationality can always point to an optimal choice about which every reasonable individual would agree clashes with the widely accepted modern idea that there is a plurality of reasonable choices . 
If this is the case , who is to decide in what areas individuals can be fairly nudged by social engineers ? 
Whose and which choices are the nudgers suppose to encourage ? 
And who will nudge the nudgers ? 
These questions , I am afraid , still await a convincing answer .
