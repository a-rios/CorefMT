Farewell to the Euro ? 
MUNICH - &quot; It &apos;s not the euro that &apos;s in danger , but the public finances of individual European countries . &quot; 
One hears this everywhere nowadays , but it &apos;s not true . 
The euro itself is at risk , because the countries in crisis have , in recent years , been running the eurozone &apos;s monetary printing presses overtime . 
Some 90 % of the refinancing debt that the commercial banks of the GIPS countries ( Greece , Ireland , Portugal , and Spain ) hold with their respective national central banks served to purchase a net inflow of goods and assets from other eurozone countries . 
Two-thirds of all refinancing loans within the eurozone were granted within the GIPS countries , despite the fact that these countries account for only 18 % of eurozone GDP . 
Indeed , 88 % of these countries &quot; current-account deficits over the last three years were financed via the extension of credit within the Eurosystem . 
By the end of 2010 , ECB loans , which originated primarily from Germany &apos;s Bundesbank , amounted to € 340 billion . 
This figure includes ECB credit that financed capital flight from Ireland totaling € 130 billion over the past three years . 
The ECB bailout program has enabled the people of the peripheral countries to continue to live beyond their means , and well-heeled asset holders to take their wealth elsewhere . 
The capacity for continuing this policy will soon be depleted , as the central-bank money flowing from the GIPS countries to the core countries of the eurozone increasingly crowds out the money created through refinancing operations there . 
If this continues for two more years as it has for the past three , the stock of refinancing loans in Germany will disappear altogether . 
Indeed , Deutsche Bank has already stopped participating in refinancing operations . 
If German banks drop out of the refinancing business , the European Central Bank will lose the direct control over the German economy that it used to have via its interest-rate policy . 
The main refinancing rate would then only be the rate at which the peripheral EU countries draw ECB money for purchases in the center of Europe , which ultimately would be the source of all the money circulating in the euro area . 
The GIPS &quot; enormous current-account deficits - and the massive exodus of capital from Ireland , in particular - would not have been possible without ECB financing . 
Without the additional money that GIPS central banks created in excess of their countries &quot; requirements for internal circulation , trade deficits could not have been sustained , and the GIPS &quot; commercial banks would have been unable to prop up asset prices ( which all too often were those of government bonds ) . 
Last year , with the ECB running out of tools to keep Europe &apos;s troubled banks from precipitating a financial crisis , follow-up financing was agreed upon , and from 2013 onwards the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) is meant to take on that responsibility . 
This may relieve some pressure , but it only shifts the problem from the ECB bailout fund to the community of states . 
The ESM is a sure way to bring Europe to its knees , because the longer bailout loans continue , the longer the GIPS &quot; current-account deficits will persist , and the more their external debts will grow . 
Eventually , these debts will become unsustainable . 
The sole exception is Ireland , which is suffering not from a lack of competitiveness , but from capital flight . 
Ireland is the only country that has lowered its prices and wages , and its current-account deficit is about to swing into surplus . 
By contrast , Spain &apos;s external deficit is still above 4 % of GDP , while Portugal and Greece recently recorded astronomical figures of around 10 % . 
What Europe is trying to do in Portugal and Greece is reminiscent of central banks &quot; futile efforts in past decades to keep exchange rates away from the market equilibrium price level . 
Some central banks , such as the Bank of England in its unsuccessful fight against George Soros in 1992 , got burned ; when it became clear how much money was required to buck the market , the policy was abandoned . 
Apart from China , central banks don &apos;t intervene to protect their currencies anymore . 
Europe , too , will get a bloody nose if it keeps trying to artificially prop up asset prices in the periphery . 
The sums required for this could ultimately run into trillions , according to an estimate by Citibank . 
This would shatter Europe . 
Apart from financial restructuring , which is crucial , Greece and Portugal must become cheaper in order to regain their competitiveness . 
Estimates for Greece assume that prices and wages need to come down by 20-30 % . 
Things won &apos;t be much different in Portugal . 
If these countries lack the political consensus they need to pull this off , they should in their own interest consider leaving the eurozone temporarily to depreciate their currencies . 
The banking system would not survive this without help , so the EU &apos;s bailout activities should be refocused accordingly . 
But these countries &quot; real economies would benefit from a furlough from the eurozone . 
Depreciation inside the eurozone in the form of deflation , on the other hand , would drive large parts of the real economy into excessive debt , because only the value of assets , not that of bank debts , would decline . 
The transitional independent privatization agency proposed by Jean-Claude Juncker for paying the Greek debt is not a good idea . 
First , it would at best aim to solve the debt problem ; it would not increase competitiveness . 
Second , Germany &apos;s experience with this kind of agency shows that it is impossible to sell off large parts of an economy simultaneously . 
Europe &apos;s banks would make a killing without reducing Greek debt in any meaningful way . 
It is time to face the fact that Europe &apos;s peripheral countries have to shrink their nominal GDP to regain competitiveness . The only question is whether they will take the euro down as well .
