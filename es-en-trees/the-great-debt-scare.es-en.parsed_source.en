The Great Debt Scare 
NEW HAVEN - It might not seem that Europe &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis and growing concern about the United States &quot; debt position should shake basic economic confidence . 
But they apparently have . 
And loss of confidence , by discouraging consumption and investment , can be a self-fulfilling prophecy , causing the economic weakness that is feared . 
Significant drops in consumer-confidence indices in Europe and North America already reflect this perverse dynamic . 
We now have a daily index for the US , the Gallup Economic Confidence Index , so we can pinpoint changes in confidence over time . 
The Gallup Index dropped sharply between the first week of July and the first week of August - the period when US political leaders worried everyone that they would be unable to raise the federal government &apos;s debt ceiling and prevent the US from defaulting on August 2 . 
August 2 came and went , with no default , but , three days later , a Friday , Standard 
Poor &apos;s lowered its rating on long-term US debt from AAA to AA + . 
The following Monday , the S P 500 dropped almost 7 % . 
Apparently , the specter of government deadlock causing a humiliating default suddenly made the US resemble the European countries that really are teetering on the brink . 
Europe &apos;s story became America &apos;s story . 
Changes in public confidence are built upon such narratives , because the human mind is very receptive to them , particularly human-interest stories . 
The story of a possible US default is resonant in precisely this way , implicating as it does America &apos;s sense of pride , fragile world dominance , and political upheavals . 
Indeed , this is arguably a more captivating story than was the most intense moment of the financial crisis , in 2008 , when Lehman Brothers collapsed . 
The drop in the Gallup Economic Confidence Index was sharper in July 2011 than it was in 2008 , although the index has not yet fallen to a lower level than it reached then . 
Most confidence indices today are based on survey questions that ask respondents to assess the economy today or in the near future . 
George Gallup , the pioneer of survey methods and creator of the Gallup poll , created a confidence index in 1938 , late in the Great Depression , when he asked Americans , &quot; Do you think business will be better or worse six months from now ? &quot; 
He interpreted the answers as measuring &quot; public optimism &quot; and &quot; the intangible mental attitude which is recognized as one vital element in the week-to-week fluctuations of business activity . &quot; 
But it hardly seems likely that big changes in people &apos;s confidence ( the kind of confidence that affects their willingness to spend or invest ) are rooted in expectations over so short a time horizon . 
When George Gallup wrote , almost nine years after the Great Depression began , a sense of ultimate futility - a belief that high unemployment would never end - was widespread . 
That sentiment probably held back consumption and investment far more than any opinions about changes in the next six months . 
After all , consumers &quot; willingness to spend depends on their general situation , not on whether business will be a little better in the short term . 
Likewise , businesses &quot; willingness to hire people and expand operations depends on their longer-term expectations . 
The Consumer Sentiment Survey of Americans , created by George Katona at the University of Michigan in the early 1950 &quot; s , and known today as the Thomson-Reuters University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers , has included a remarkable question about the reasonably long-term future , five years hence , and asks about visceral fears concerning that period : 
&quot; Looking ahead , which would you say is more likely - that in the country as a whole we &apos;ll have continuous good times during the next five years or so , or that we will have periods of widespread unemployment or depression , or what ? &quot; 
That question is usually not singled out for attention , but it appears spot-on for what we really want to know : what deep anxieties and fears do people have that might inhibit their willingness to spend for a long time . 
The answers to that question might well help us forecast the future outlook much more accurately . 
Those answers plunged into depression territory between July and August , and the index of optimism based on answers to this question is at its lowest level since the oil-crisis-induced &quot; great recession &quot; of the early 1980 &quot; s . 
It stood at 135 , its highest-ever level , in 2000 , at the very peak of the millennium stock market bubble . 
By May 2011 , it had fallen to 88 . 
By September , just four months later , it was down to 48 . 
This is a much bigger downswing than was recorded in the overall consumer-confidence indices . 
The decline occurred over the better part of a decade , as we began to see the end of debt-driven overexpansion , and accelerated with the latest debt crisis . 
The timing and substance of these consumer-survey results suggest that our fundamental outlook about the economy , at the level of the average person , is closely bound up with stories of excessive borrowing , loss of governmental and personal responsibility , and a sense that matters are beyond control . 
That kind of loss of confidence may well last for years . 
That said , the economic outlook can never be fully analyzed with conventional statistical models , for it may hinge on something that such models do not include : our finding some way to replace one narrative - currently a tale of out-of-control debt - with a more inspiring story .
