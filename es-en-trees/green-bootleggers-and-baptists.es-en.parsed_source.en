Green Bootleggers and Baptists 
NEW YORK - In May , the United Nations &quot; International Panel on Climate Change made media waves with a new report on renewable energy . 
As in the past , the IPCC first issued a short summary ; only later would it reveal all of the data . 
So it was left up to the IPCC &apos;s spin-doctors to present the take-home message for journalists . 
The first line of the IPCC &apos;s press release declared , &quot; Close to 80 % of the world &apos;s energy supply could be met by renewables by mid-century if backed by the right enabling public policies . &quot; 
That story was repeated by media organizations worldwide . 
Last month , the IPCC released the full report , together with the data behind this startlingly optimistic claim . 
Only then did it emerge that it was based solely on the most optimistic of 164 modeling scenarios that researchers investigated . 
And this single scenario stemmed from a single study that was traced back to a report by the environmental organization Greenpeace . 
The author of that report - a Greenpeace staff member - was one of the IPCC &apos;s lead authors . 
The claim rested on the assumption of a large reduction in global energy use . Given the number of people climbing out of poverty in China and India , that is a deeply implausible scenario . 
When the IPCC first made the claim , global-warming activists and renewable-energy companies cheered . 
&quot; The report clearly demonstrates that renewable technologies could supply the world with more energy than it would ever need , &quot; boasted Steve Sawyer , Secretary-General of the Global Wind Energy Council . 
This sort of behavior - with activists and big energy companies uniting to applaud anything that suggests a need for increased subsidies to alternative energy - was famously captured by the so-called &quot; bootleggers and Baptists &quot; theory of politics . 
The theory grew out of the experience of the southern United States , where many jurisdictions required stores to close on Sunday , thus preventing the sale of alcohol . 
The regulation was supported by religious groups for moral reasons , but also by bootleggers , because they had the market to themselves on Sundays . 
Politicians would adopt the Baptists &quot; pious rhetoric , while quietly taking campaign contributions from the criminals . 
Of course , today &apos;s climate-change &quot; bootleggers &quot; are not engaged in any illegal behavior . 
Indeed , the &quot; bootleggers and Baptists &quot; theory helps to account for other developments in global warming policy over the past decade or so . 
For example , the Kyoto Protocol would have cost trillions of dollars , but would have achieved a practically indiscernible difference in stemming the rise in global temperature . 
Yet activists claimed that there was a moral obligation to cut carbon-dioxide emissions , and were cheered on by businesses that stood to gain . 
During the ill-fated Copenhagen climate summit in December 2009 , Denmark &apos;s capital city was plastered with slick ads urging the delegates to make a strong deal -paid for by Vestas , the world &apos;s largest windmill producer . 
Oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens , a famous convert to environmentalism , drafted a &quot; plan &quot; ( which he named after himself ) to increase America &apos;s reliance on renewables . 
Of course , he would also have been one of the major investors in the wind-power and natural-gas companies that would benefit from government subsidies . 
Traditional energy giants like BP and Shell have championed their &quot; green &quot; credentials , while standing to profit from selling oil or gas instead of environmentally &quot; unfriendly &quot; coal . 
Even US electricity giant Duke Energy , a major coal consumer , won green kudos for promoting a US cap-and-trade scheme . 
Dubious claims by faithful activists gave rise to the biofuels industry ( with supporting lobbyists ) . 
Biofuel production likely increases atmospheric carbon , owing to the massive deforestation that it requires , while crop diversion increases food prices and contributes to global hunger . 
While environmentalists have started to acknowledge this , the industry received a lot of activist support when it began - and neither agribusiness nor green-energy producers have any interest in changing course now . 
Obviously , private firms are motivated by self-interest , and that is not necessarily a bad thing . 
Business support for expensive policies such as the Kyoto Protocol - which would have done very little for climate change - indicate otherwise . 
The climate-change &quot; Baptists &quot; provide the moral cover that politicians can use to sell regulation , along with scary stories that the media can use to attract readers or viewers . 
Businesses see opportunities for taxpayer-funded subsidies , and to pass on inevitable cost growth to consumers . 
Unfortunately , this convergence of interests can push us to focus on ineffective , expensive responses to climate change . 
Whenever opposite political forces attract , as activists and big business have in the case of global warming , there is a high risk that the public interest will be caught in the middle .
