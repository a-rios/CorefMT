China &apos;s Great Leap Backward 
WASHINGTON , DC - This week , Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) leaders are meeting in Beijing for a plenary session centered on one topic : the rule of law . 
Yet , in recent days , several groups on WeChat ( a popular Chinese social network ) have described the arrests of nearly 50 Chinese activists who support the protests in Hong Kong . 
Others have reported on an official order to ban the publication or sale of books by authors who support the Hong Kong protests , human-rights activism , and the rule of law . 
This casts serious doubt on the credibility of the government &apos;s commitment to its stated goal of political modernization . 
Among the banned authors is the economist Mao Yushi , who received the Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty in 2012 . 
This is not the first time that Mao &apos;s books have been banned . 
In 2003 , his work was proscribed after he signed a petition appealing to the government to exonerate the student protesters whose democratic movement ended with the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre . 
China often does not even issue an official public notice of censorship ; an &quot; anonymous &quot; phone call to a publisher , understood to be from an official agency , will suffice . 
A couple of articles in one of my own books were deleted without an official explanation , and phrases , sentences , and even paragraphs have regularly been removed from my columns and commentaries in journals and newspapers . 
Another respected author , the 84-year-old Yu Ying-shih , is also under siege for his support of the Hong Kong protests . 
Yu , who has taught in the United States at a string of Ivy League universities , has been a prolific critic of the CCP for more than five decades . 
In his books , Yu criticizes China &apos;s traditional culture and classical philosophy , and advances universal values based on Western scholarly tradition . 
Though the books contain no direct reference to contemporary political issues , China &apos;s government views them as critical of CCP rule and thus damaging to social stability . 
Then there is Zhang Qianfan , a cautious and prudent scholar , who serves as Vice President of the China Constitutional Law Association . 
Zhang &apos;s moderate approach to political analysis - during our time as colleagues at Peking University , Zhang criticized some of my stances as excessively derogatory toward the current regime - makes him a somewhat surprising target for the government . 
Zhang opposes the decision by many of his contemporaries ( including me ) to support the protests in Hong Kong , fearing that the government will resort to violent repression , as it did in 1989 . 
Given this , the banning of Zhang &apos;s books most likely resulted not from his views on the protests , but from the implications of his constitutional research . 
Far less surprising was the recent arrest of the well-known activist and human-rights advocate Guo Yushan , who has been involved with many so-called &quot; sensitive &quot; issues over the last decade . 
In 2012 , for example , he played a key role in helping the world-famous blind activist Chen Guangcheng escape from house arrest - a major international embarrassment for China . 
Nonetheless , the timing of Guo &apos;s arrest , shortly before this month &apos;s plenary session , highlights the CCP &apos;s lack of sincerity when it comes to the rule of law . 
The treatment of Chinese dissidents , inside and outside the country , is abhorrent . 
Either they are jailed for their supposed crimes , or prohibited from visiting their families in China - sometimes for two or three decades . 
This is not the fate only of vocal anti-CCP figures . 
Scholars and researchers - from former Princeton University Professor Perry Link and Columbia University Professor Andrew Nathan to Li Jianglin , a writer and historian focused on contemporary Tibetan history - and even businessmen have been prohibited from returning to China . 
All it takes to have a visa denied or canceled is to sympathize with human-rights movements in China or express any view that contradicts the CCP &apos;s position . 
Chinese citizens should be free to leave and enter their homeland , regardless of their political beliefs . 
Taking away this right without legal justification is a clear violation of modern international norms . 
President Xi Jinping &apos;s unprecedented anti-corruption campaign was supposed to signify a shift toward a more transparent system , based on the rule of law . 
But the fact is that the officials who have been purged so far have been Xi &apos;s political adversaries , and the entire enterprise has served to consolidate his power . 
This duplicity is also evident in the crackdown on freedom of speech , assembly , association , and movement now unfolding in China . 
Xi appears to be pulling China backwards politically , even as he seeks to drive it forward economically .
