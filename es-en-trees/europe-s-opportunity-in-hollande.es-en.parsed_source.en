Europe &apos;s Opportunity in Hollande 
BRUSSELS - Rarely has an election resonated so widely across the European Union as the French presidential ballot has done . 
Rarely has a leadership change in one EU member state created expectations of a real policy shift . 
Remarkably , a new European demos and public sphere are emerging from the economic crisis . 
Europeans are recognizing how interdependent they are . 
One country &apos;s failures can threaten the entire European economy , and can call into question the fruits of 60 years of integration . 
Peace , solidarity , and prosperity are not irreversible achievements ; only 27 countries working together can guarantee them . 
Fran√ßois Hollande &apos;s victory is a fresh chance for Europe . 
It should spell the end of a policy oriented exclusively towards austerity , which has paralyzed our economies and divided the EU . The new French president &apos;s commitment to a European growth policy has brought hope to citizens , and should not alarm anyone - certainly not the financial markets . 
Hollande &apos;s plans for a growth initiative fall on fertile ground , especially in the European Parliament , which has repeatedly called for such measures . 
I am delighted that this message is increasingly echoed by the political mainstream , including most recently by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi . 
Likewise , the European Commission is working on a &quot; growth pact &quot; to be discussed by EU leaders in June . 
Indeed , Europe needs a master plan to avoid a tailspin of recession , growing unemployment , and weakening banking systems . 
A new master plan for growth would not be about printing money . 
Fiscal discipline remains essential , as are deep structural reforms . 
The growth pact can be properly financed by new sources of revenue , such as a financial-transaction tax and joint project bonds for infrastructure investment , or by curbing tax evasion and tax fraud and eliminating tax havens , as well as by more efficient and intelligent use of structural funds . 
What is to be done ? 
First , targeted investment should be given priority . 
The European Investment Bank would be a good vehicle - in addition to new project bonds - to boost spending on major infrastructure projects ( for example , in the energy sector ) . 
The EIB could be given significantly more resources to boost its loan programs . 
In the longer-term , we should revisit the idea of joint Eurobonds . 
Channeling EU structural funds towards innovation is essential , given that spending on research and development is alarmingly low compared to our global partners . 
Fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy should not remain a taboo . 
Indeed , the CAP is ensuring neither sustainable agriculture nor decent incomes for all farmers . 
Undoubtedly , tough negotiations lie ahead on this front , including with Hollande . 
Second , young people must be a top priority . 
Our responsibility here is twofold : to put growth back on track , but also to respond immediately to the human tragedy that has hit our youth . 
The eurozone &apos;s unemployment rate , at 10.9 % , is at its highest level since the euro was introduced , and young people everywhere , as the first to suffer the consequences of the crisis , are paying a disproportionally high price . 
Youth unemployment in Spain , for example , is above 50 % . 
We cannot afford to sacrifice a generation , or , rather , risk creating a lost generation that could destroy Europe &apos;s social fabric and stability . 
We need an immediate contingency plan : invest to finance job training , improve educational opportunities , and , crucially , create incentives for employers to hire young people . 
The ECB has been offering long-term loans to banks at a favorable rate . 
This money should be loaned out to small and medium-size enterprises , which are the lifeblood of Europe &apos;s economy . 
The EU also needs common initiatives to replace piece-meal bilateral agreements on tax evasion and tax havens , which undermine the goal of a fair society . 
Third , member states should not cut the EU budget indiscriminately during negotiations on the Union &apos;s long-term spending plan for 2014-2020 . 
If we are serious about a master plan for growth , we need to provide the necessary means . 
The EU budget is an investment vehicle that boosts economic growth and creates jobs . 
It finances crucial pan-EU transport and energy links . 
It helps to foster innovation and boost research and development . 
The EU budget leverages investment , allows for economies of scale , and cannot run a deficit . 
The EU &apos;s lack of solidarity , imagination , courage , unity , and vision in recent years has made Europe a symbol of division for some , if not many . 
We cannot let this continue . 
Hollande &apos;s election offers us a valuable opportunity to meet the challenges that the EU faces . 
Alternatively , we can allow growing poverty , fear , and anger to give rise to xenophobia and racism , and thus place at risk the EU &apos;s greatest accomplishments . 
But let us be optimistic . 
It is not too late . 
Europe can still emerge stronger from its current economic woes . The EU is changing direction at last , and Europe &apos;s leaders will find an energetic partner in the European Parliament .
