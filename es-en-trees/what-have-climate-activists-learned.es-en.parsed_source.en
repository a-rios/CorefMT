What Have Climate Activists Learned ? 
COPENHAGEN - Advocates of drastic cuts in carbon-dioxide emissions now speak a lot less than they once did about climate change . 
Climate campaigners changed their approach after the collapse of the Copenhagen climate-change summit last December and the revelation of mistakes in the United Nations climate panel &apos;s work - as well as in response to growing public skepticism and declining interest . 
Although some activists still rely on scare tactics - witness the launch of an advertisement depicting the bombing of anybody who is hesitant to embrace carbon cuts - many activists now spend more time highlighting the &quot; benefits &quot; of their policy prescription . 
They no longer dwell on impending climate doom , but on the economic windfall that will result from embracing the &quot; green &quot; economy . 
You can find examples all over the world , but one of the best is in my home country , Denmark , where a government-appointed committee of academics recently presented their suggestions for how the country could go it alone and become &quot; fossil fuel-free &quot; in 40 years . 
The goal is breathtaking : more than 80 % of Denmark &apos;s energy supply comes from fossil fuels , which are dramatically cheaper and more reliable than any green energy source . 
I attended the committee &apos;s launch and was startled that the &quot; Climate Commission &quot; barely mentioned climate change . 
This omission is understandable , since one country acting alone cannot do much to stop global warming . 
If Denmark were indeed to become 100 % fossil-free by 2050 , and remain so for the rest of the century , the effect , by 2100 , would be to delay the rise in average global temperature by just two weeks . 
Instead of focusing on climate change , the Climate Commission hyped the benefits that Denmark would experience if it led the shift to green energy . 
Unfortunately , on inspection these benefits turn out to be illusory . 
Being a pioneer is hardly a guarantee of riches . 
Germany led the world in putting up solar panels , funded by € 47 billion in subsidies . 
The lasting legacy is a massive bill , and lots of inefficient solar technology sitting on rooftops throughout a fairly cloudy country , delivering a trivial 0.1 % of its total energy supply . 
Denmark itself has also already tried being a green-energy innovator - it led the world in embracing wind power . 
The results are hardly inspiring . 
Denmark &apos;s wind industry is almost completely dependent on taxpayer subsidies , and Danes pay the highest electricity rates of any industrialized nation . 
Several studies suggest that claims that one-fifth of Denmark &apos;s electricity demand is met by wind are an exaggeration , in part because much of the power is produced when there is no demand and must be sold to other countries . 
The sorry state of wind and solar power shows the massive challenge that we face in trying to make today &apos;s technology competitive and efficient . 
Direct-current lines need to be constructed to carry solar and wind energy from sunny , windy areas to where most people live . 
Storage mechanisms need to be invented so that power is not interrupted whenever there is no sunshine or wind . 
Proponents of carbon cuts argue that green-energy technologies only seem more expensive , because the price of fossil fuels does not reflect the cost of their impact on the climate . 
The most comprehensive economic meta-study shows that total future climate impacts would justify a tax of around € 0.01 per liter of petrol ( $ 0.06 per gallon in the United States ) - an amount dwarfed by the taxes already imposed by most European countries . 
Despite the fact that changing from fossil fuels to green energy requires a total economic transformation , Denmark &apos;s Climate Commission claimed that the price tag would be next to nothing . 
The Commission reached this conclusion by assuming that the cost of not embracing its recommended policy would be massive . 
The Commission believes that over the next four decades , fossil-fuel costs will climb sharply , because sources will dry up and governments will place massive taxes on fossil fuels . 
There is clearly plenty of cheap coal for hundreds of years , and with new cracking technology , gas is becoming more abundant . 
Even oil supplies are likely to be significantly boosted by non-conventional sources like tar sands . 
By the same token , the prediction that governments will impose massive carbon taxes has little basis in reality . 
Such assumptions seem like a poor framework on which to build significant public policy , and seem to ignore the substantial cost of eliminating fossil fuels , which is likely to amount to at least 5 % of GDP per year . 
The shift away from fossil fuels will not be easy . 
Policymakers must prioritize investment in green-energy research and development . 
Trying to force carbon cuts instead of investing first in research puts the cart before the horse . 
Breakthroughs do not result automatically from a combination of taxes on fossil fuels and subsidies for present-day green energy : despite the massive outlays associated with the Kyoto Protocol , participating countries &quot; investment in R D as a percentage of GDP did not increase . 
The change in message after the disaster of the Copenhagen summit was probably inevitable .
