Back to Utopia ? 
PARIS - France no longer claims center stage in world history , but it remains influential beyond its national borders . 
From the eighteenth century on - including Charles de Gaulle &apos;s epic role in World War II , decolonization in Africa , and the May 1968 student revolt - France has been a frequent bellwether of deep societal changes across Europe . 
Will its recent presidential election continue that tradition ? 
François Hollande , bland and bureaucratic , campaigned on a promise to be a &quot; normal &quot; president , unlike the colorful incumbent , Nicolas Sarkozy - and , indeed , unlike all of his predecessors since the Fifth Republic was established in 1959 . 
Hollande &apos;s victory thus may be a sign that democratic countries have become reluctant to be led by flamboyant or charismatic presidents or prime ministers . 
Indeed , across Europe , no democracy is currently led by a strong or charismatic personality . 
Italy remains under an interim administration , but there , too , voters appear to have turned their backs on a rococo ruler . 
Europe has no Sarkozy or Silvio Berlusconi , but also no Margaret Thatcher , Helmut Kohl , or José Maria Aznar . 
At a time of economic and institutional crisis in Europe , all European leaders appear to be , well , extremely normal . 
For many , the victory of normalcy over charisma should be cause for celebration . 
Democracy is about normal citizens electing normal men and women to lead them for a limited period according to established rules . 
But the trend toward normalcy among European leaders coincides with a remarkable absence of vision and strategy . 
If any of these normal leaders have a long-term strategy for Europe ( can anyone imagine such a thing from EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy or the Union &apos;s foreign-policy supremo , Catherine Ashton ? ) , they are remarkably unable to convey it . 
In Hollande &apos;s case , the rare glimpses of a comprehensive vision recall France &apos;s successful social democracy of the 1960 &quot; s : a strong welfare state , together with abundant public investment to revive economic growth and boost employment . 
Hollande &apos;s reference point seems to be the post-war idyll of his youth , a time of rapid growth , demographic recovery , scarce immigration , and scant global competition . 
In other words , Hollande will try to entice other European leaders with a vision for a world that no longer exists . 
This politics of nostalgia is troubling , not only because France and Europe confront severe economic challenges , but also because France and other democracies are confronted with real challenges to their legitimacy . 
In hindsight , the 2012 French Presidential election could well be remembered not so much for Hollande &apos;s victory and the triumph of normalcy , but as the decisive step in populist parties &quot; long march to power . 
In the first round of the French presidential election , the far left , a motley collection of anti-capitalists and radical environmentalists garnered 14 % of the vote . 
On the far right , Marine Le Pen &apos;s National Front , the political heir of French fascism , won 18 % , the party &apos;s best result ever . 
In other words , one-third of French voters are now attracted to candidates with extreme ideologies that share an anti-liberal rejection of the euro , capitalism , and globalization . 
Both sides find their roots in an idealized past : the French Revolution and its egalitarian promise for the far left , and the French Empire and its domination of the world &apos;s non-white peoples for the far right . 
Moreover , both extremes are strongly nationalistic . 
Persuaded as they are that France should act alone , they would close the economy to foreign competition , suppress financial markets , and send immigrants back to their homelands . 
The convergence goes beyond their agendas &quot; common irrationality . 
Both the far left and the far right find their core constituency among the vast number of French who feel economically insecure and politically disenfranchised - in essence , all those who perceive themselves as having no opportunity in an open society . 
Hollande &apos;s brand of normalcy does not appeal to these populist voters . 
Slow growth and globalization have divided all European societies - and the United States - into two new classes : those whose education and social capital enable them to cope with today &apos;s globalized economy , and those stuck in low-paid , often transient jobs ( and thus most directly affected by competition from legal and illegal immigrants ) . 
No mainstream European leader , including Hollande , even mentions this new division . 
Indeed , both Hollande and Sarkozy represented those adapted to globalization and viewed the rest as a reservoir of voters to be seduced , not as a new underclass . 
This superficial understanding of populism makes the French presidential election an ominous symptom of Europe &apos;s blind leadership . 
A façade of normalcy cannot withstand the real dangers threatening the foundations of European societies .
