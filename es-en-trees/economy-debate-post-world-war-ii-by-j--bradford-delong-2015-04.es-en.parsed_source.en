An Even More Dismal Science 
BERKELEY - For the past 25 years , a debate has raged among some of the world &apos;s leading economists . 
Three positions have been staked out . 
First out of the gate , in 1991 , was Larry Summers , with his seminal paper , &quot; How Should Long-Term Monetary Policy Be Determined ? &quot; 
Summers was unconvinced that the underlying economic reality had changed , so his focus was technical - an attempt to guard against a repetition of the inflationary disturbances of the 1970s that marked the end of the glory years . 
His prescription was to strengthen the technocratic independence of central banks . 
Politicians should set goals , but they should avoid micromanaging the economy or imposing strict rules that would inevitably fail in unexpected circumstances . 
Technocrats were far better placed to carry the policy forward , Summers argued , guided by a target of 2-3 % annual inflation . 
The debate continued with Paul Krugman &apos;s 1998 paper , &quot; It &apos;s Baaack : Japan &apos;s Slump and the Return of the Liquidity Trap &quot; and his book The Return of Depression Economics , published the following year . 
Krugman made the case that central banks had already succeeded in anchoring inflation expectations to low levels , but had nonetheless failed to put the economy back on track . 
The economy in Europe and the United States , Krugman argued , had fallen from glory and returned to a pre-World War II pattern of &quot; depression economics , &quot; in which its dominant features were shortages of aggregate demand , risks of deflation , financial crises , and liquidity traps . 
Then Ken Rogoff entered the fray with a comment on Krugman &apos;s paper . 
In Rogoff &apos;s view , what Krugman described as a long-term return to &quot; depression economics &quot; was a temporary condition , the consequence of failures to regulate properly and curb debt accumulation . 
This phenomenon , which he identified as the cause of the economic turbulence , inevitably ended in catastrophe , which could be resolved only through painful deleveraging and heterodox government-enforced debt write-downs . 
Other prominent economists - including Joseph Stiglitz , Ben Bernanke , and Martin Feldstein - contributed to the debate as well . 
Today , a degree of consensus has emerged . 
There is no longer much point in questioning whether the glory days are over . 
The models and approaches developed to understand the post-war business cycle and its bias toward moderate inflation are worse than useless today . 
Disagreement among economists nowadays reflects different positions not so much on the state of the economy , but on whether macroeconomic policy can provide an effective cure . 
Summers has more or less abandoned his belief that central banks can , will , and perhaps even should attempt to prevent the return of depression economics . 
Central banks might have been able to attain the technocratic ideal of macroeconomic business-cycle management that Summers hoped for back in 1991 , but they failed to do so . 
And few central bankers , if any , seem to have good ideas concerning institutional changes that could strengthen their ability to accomplish that mission . 
In Summers &apos;s view , with which I concur , governments need to assume greater responsibility for risk-bearing , long-term planning , and investment . 
Indeed , those governments lucky enough to issue the world &apos;s reserve currencies are able to take on this role without overloading future taxpayers with inordinate debt burdens . 
But , although Summers and Krugman now believe that more expansionary fiscal policies could accomplish a great deal of good , Rogoff continues to adhere to the Minskyite position that has underpinned his thinking since at least 1998 : successful macroeconomic performance requires regulating finance and curbing debt accumulation during boom times . 
Attempting to cure an overhang of private debt by issuing mountains of &quot; safe &quot; government debt is too dangerous . 
After all , when the private debt was issued , it , too , was considered safe . 
Whichever policies - macro or micro - turn out to work best for addressing today &apos;s economic problems , one thing has become abundantly clear : optimism is out of fashion .
