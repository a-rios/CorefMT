Toward a Peaceful Pacific 
MELBOURNE - The Western Pacific is currently facing a difficult problem - how to accommodate China &apos;s rising aspirations in a region where the United States has held primacy since the Cold War &apos;s end . 
Is the US determined to maintain dominance in the Asia-Pacific region ? 
Or is it willing to operate through multilateral forums that allow all involved parties to help set the rules ? 
The way this issue plays out will determine whether peace continues to prevail across the Pacific . 
It is difficult to see the stationing of 2,500 US Marines in Darwin , Australia - a decision announced by US President Barack Obama on his recent tour of Asia - as anything more than a symbolic gesture , a provocative reminder that the US is determined to stay in the region . 
America &apos;s purpose , however , remains unclear . 
Across the Asia-Pacific region , China &apos;s rise is viewed as a welcome development , but one that requires China to play within internationally accepted rules . 
That dictum , of course , should apply to everyone . 
It is difficult to predict how America role in the region will evolve . 
China &apos;s economic and military power is rising . 
The US , on the other hand , continues to dominate militarily , while its economic influence is waning . 
In any case , China will invariably respond harshly to US efforts to step up its military presence in the region . 
Containing China is not the answer to Asia &apos;s security questions . 
The Korean peninsula , Taiwan , and the South China Sea &apos;s islands and sea lanes are all issues of potential dispute between the US and China . 
Under current conditions , responding to China &apos;s rise with military force would be unwelcome . 
China is modernizing its military and intends to become a significant sea power , prompting many China observers to call for greater transparency . 
To put the issue in perspective , the US defense budget constitutes 43 % of all military spending worldwide , whereas China &apos;s expenditure represents a little over 7 % . 
No country will talk openly about its military capacity in anything but the broadest terms . 
Too many observers forget that China &apos;s nuclear force is a deterrent only - far too small to be a first-strike force . 
China has demonstrated no interest in emulating either the nineteenth-century European imperial powers , or Japan &apos;s imperial efforts in the first half of the twentieth century . 
Anxiety about such ambitions ignores China &apos;s history . 
The Chinese remember all too painfully the unequal treaties imposed by the Western powers on China and Japan in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . 
An alliance between the US , Japan , Australia , and possibly India designed to contain China would be greeted by the Chinese with that history firmly in mind . 
China will most likely regard the cooperation agreement recently announced by the Japanese and Indian defense ministers as a response to US pressure . 
While the historical background is important , the West &apos;s strategic position depends on today &apos;s actions . 
To reduce tensions in the region , perhaps the US should initiate long-avoided direct talks with North Korea , which could help to resolve the security issues posed by that country &apos;s regime . 
Furthermore , the Spratly Islands dispute should be resolved through international adjudication . 
The islands , claimed by China , Taiwan , Vietnam , the Philippines , Malaysia , and Brunei , are valuable because of their oil reserves and commercial fishing industry . 
It is critical that the countries claiming sovereignty over the islands abide by international law and commit to keeping the area &apos;s sea-lanes open . 
Diplomacy , not force of arms , is the best way to pursue these objectives . 
Of course , diplomacy needs to be backed by strength , but the US has plenty without militarizing the Asia-Pacific region more than it already has . 
Peaceful resolution of these conflicts requires giving China a role in the decision-making process , which implies that the US and China alike relinquish any desire for regional primacy . 
During the first Taiwan Straits crisis in 1954 , China began shelling the offshore islands Quemoy and Matsu , threatening to &quot; liberate &quot; Taiwan . 
As the US contemplated a possible nuclear attack on China , Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies quietly told US President Dwight Eisenhower , &quot; If there is a war over Taiwan , it is your affair and not ours . &quot; 
Menzies was right . 
He understood the distinction between US objectives and Australia &apos;s national interests . 
The US will never place a large land army on the Asian mainland again . 
Wars cannot be won from the air alone , and the US will not start a nuclear contest . 
The stationing of US Marines in northern Australia thus appears pointless : these troops have no conceivable reason to be there . 
In addition , they have divided Australian public opinion unnecessarily on the vital issue of the country &apos;s security . 
Asia today presents a completely new and unique set of circumstances . 
The dilemmas arising from these circumstances demand new solutions , not obsolete Cold War-era concepts .
