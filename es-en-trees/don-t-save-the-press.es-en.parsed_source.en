Don &apos;t Save the Press 
LJUBLJANA - Throughout history , political leaders have supported existing communication technologies in order to defend the system in which they rule . 
Today , too , governments may be tempted to protect newspapers and public TV on the pretext of &quot; saving democracy as we know it . &quot; 
But efforts to block technological change have been futile in the past , and they would be unwise today . 
Instead , the political system ( and the media ) must adapt to the new reality . 
Faced with an existential crisis as new technologies lure away their readers and viewers , traditional news media - just like bankers , car manufacturers , and solar electricity producers - are increasingly turning to governments for help . 
But , such is the undertone , their cause is nobler . 
The media are a cornerstone of democracy . 
Left to the blogs and tweets , without journalists to report the news , how can citizens decide what politics to support ? 
Such thinking reflects an age-old fear : as Plato put it , citizens would get &quot; information without proper instruction and , in consequence , be thought very knowledgeable when they are for the most part quite ignorant . &quot; 
It is a fear that has echoed down through history ever since , from the Catholic Church cursing Gutenberg &apos;s movable type to the Victorian bourgeois complaining of the newly discovered freedom of the press . 
Political rulers , too , have never liked new communication technology , because the political system in which they rule is adapted to the existing technology . 
Scarcity of parchment required all decision-making to be concentrated in a court consisting of a handful of people . 
When cheap paper and printing presses - the first true mass-communication technology - challenged this system , the Catholic Church and the monarchs defended the parchment-based monopoly . 
They failed . 
The transition was not smooth , but those who understood the signs of the times early gained a historical head start . 
It is not a coincidence that Benjamin Franklin had a background in printing and newspaper publishing . 
The liberal-democratic political system that resulted from the American Revolution was well aligned with the emerging information technology of the time . 
In the &quot; scarce bandwidth &quot; media of the past , in which space and time were limited , the media had to select stories worthy of reporting . 
Mass media could report few big stories in which a few big actors took center stage . 
In stories about politics , these big actors were political parties . 
High-circulation newspapers correlate with high-circulation political parties . 
We are right , they are left ; we think this , they think that : condensed narratives fit easily on a newspaper &apos;s front page or into the tighter constraints of broadcast journalism . 
This created a mutually reinforcing symbiosis between the old mass media and old mass political movements , one hostile to the entry of new players . 
Newspapers and broadcast organizations , like political parties , were expensive to set up , but , once established , they benefited from economies of scale - operating costs remained relatively fixed as circulation ( or party membership ) grew . 
They maintain a keen interest in the public &apos;s eyes and ears - and thus in each other . 
Unfortunately for both , their main strengths - transmitting information and connecting people - happen to be what the Internet does best . 
Blogs and social-networking platforms encourage seamless , cost-free association - the most efficient form of organization imaginable . 
No newspaper or broadcast news program can hope to report on what every Facebook group is up to . 
So it probably would not take much for politicians to be persuaded that the press is essential to democracy , and that its survival - like that of public television in many countries - depends on government support . 
Advertising revenue would be replaced by government subsidies , raising predictable questions about the impact on content . 
The alternative is to focus on what communication technology cannot do : 
In 1990s , Bill Gates said , &quot; In the next century , leaders will be those who empower others . &quot; 
Deciding whom to empower , and whom to allow to participate , rather than deciding to save the existing media technology , will determine the future of political parties and the systems in which they govern .
