The End of Iran &apos;s Islamic Revolution 
STONY BROOK - The nuclear deal reached in July by Iran and its international interlocutors marks an obvious turning point in the Islamic Republic &apos;s relations with the outside world , particularly with the United States . 
But why has it taken so much longer for the US to come to terms with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini &apos;s revolution in Iran than it did with Mao Zedong &apos;s revolution in China ? 
Of course , one explanation for the prolonged bilateral freeze is the warped discourse of what George W. Bush foolishly called the &quot; global war on terror , &quot; in which Iran , along with Iraq and North Korea , was cast as part of an international &quot; axis of evil . &quot; 
As a result , US officials viewed any move toward diplomatic normalization as unacceptable &quot; appeasement . &quot; 
But the Bush administration &apos;s moralistic foreign policy merely reinforced America &apos;s stance since Iran &apos;s 1979 Islamic Revolution . 
And it is in the history and course of that revolution that a fuller and more compelling explanation of recent events is to be found . 
Forget the French Revolution as a model : the so-called Thermidorian Reaction , when moderates ended Robespierre &apos;s Reign of Terror , was an exception to the pattern of modern revolutions . 
The typical pattern during our living memory is that the hardliners come after the moderates . 
In the Soviet Union , for example , it was hardliners after World War II who strove to export Marxist-Leninist revolution , condemning the world to decades of cold war . 
So , too , with Iran . 
After Khomeini &apos;s death in 1989 , the pragmatic Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani became President , followed by the reform-minded Mohammad Khatami . 
But the hardliners struck back . 
When Khatami &apos;s reform program was ineffective , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , an obscure officer of the Basij militia , was elected Mayor of Tehran in 2003 ( after just 12 % of the city &apos;s voters turned out ) , and then defeated Rafsanjani in 2005 to become President . 
Ahmadinejad , a fanatical devotee of Khomeini , the revolution &apos;s first imam , was a reminder of the revolution &apos;s populist inception . 
To promote an aggressive nuclear policy was to vindicate Khomeini &apos;s battle against America , &quot; the Great Satan . &quot; 
Only when Iran &apos;s voters lost patience with Ahmadinejad &apos;s incompetence and elected Hassan Rouhani in 2013 could the Islamic Revolution be said to be over . 
Could America have avoided the waste of the Ahmadinejad years ? 
His predecessors had made serious efforts to improve relations with the US . 
Encouraged by the victory of the US-led coalition in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq ( the Islamic Republic &apos;s arch-enemy ) , in 1995 Rafsanjani sent very clear signals to the US of a willingness to restore diplomatic ties . 
The Clinton administration ignored Rafsanjani &apos;s effort , and the following year the US Congress unanimously passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act . 
Admittedly , Bill Clinton and his advisers had plenty of reasons for skepticism . 
Rafsanjani was at least partly hostage to hardline opponents keen to sabotage his foreign-policy initiatives with precisely timed acts of terror in France , Germany , and Argentina . 
But Clinton and his secretary of state , Madeleine Albright , took seriously the proposal by Khatami , Rafsanjani &apos;s successor , at the UN General Assembly in 2000 for a &quot; dialogue of civilizations &quot; to open what he called &quot; a crack in the wall of mistrust &quot; between Iran and the US . 
Sadly , Iran &apos;s Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , forced his president and foreign minister to avoid the planned handshakes with their American counterparts . 
Worse was to follow for those hoping for better US-Iran relations . 
First , there was Bush &apos;s &quot; axis of evil &quot; speech in 2002 . 
Then , in February 2005 , just as the hardline Ahmadinejad was about to begin his first term as president , Bush formally rejected a nuclear deal that had been painstakingly negotiated by Rouhani ( then Khamenei &apos;s representative in Iran &apos;s Supreme National Security Council ) and signed in late 2004 by France , Germany , and Britain . 
As Iran scanned the strategic horizon , it seemed obvious that the US had invaded Iraq because Saddam did not have any weapons of mass destruction . 
This made Ahmadinejad &apos;s insistence on Iran &apos;s nuclear &quot; rights &quot; popular with the Iranian masses and the middle class alike . 
Despite popular disenchantment with the Ahmadinejad era , that sentiment still prevails in Iran . 
But the nuclear accord reached last month is the product of a different political context : President Barack Obama was eager to make a deal with Iran part of his legacy , and this time , Rouhani , as President , was able to negotiate with the full backing of Khamenei , with whom ( unlike Khatami ) he has worked closely . 
But there is a deeper reason for the success of the nuclear negotiations : Khomeini &apos;s Islamic revolution of 1979 has finally ended - and Khamenei knows it . 
He must also know that the export of Islamic revolution from Shia Iran has lost its allure , replaced in the Sunni world first by the global jihad of al-Qaeda and now by the so-called Islamic State and caliphate of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . 
For Iran , what counts now is no longer ideology but national interest and realpolitik . 
That is why it finds itself currently backing the opponents of revolutionary Islam : Bashar al-Assad against the Islamists in Syria and the Houthis against al-Qaeda in Yemen . 
And it is why it finds itself not only signing a nuclear accord with the Great Satan but also tacitly cooperating with it against the Islamic State , their common enemy . 
Now that the revolution is over , cooperation in other areas is likely to become equally appealing .
