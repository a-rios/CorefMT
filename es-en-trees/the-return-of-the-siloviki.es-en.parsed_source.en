The Return of the Siloviki 
STOCKHOLM - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin recently announced that Russia , Belarus , and Kazakhstan have abandoned their separate talks to join the World Trade Organization . 
Instead , they would seek to enter the world trade body as a single customs union . 
In effect , this means that Russia seems to be casting aside its accession to the WTO - a major reversal of Russian strategy . 
Putin &apos;s statement hit like a bolt from the blue . 
Two days earlier , United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk and European Union Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton had completed successful talks on Russia &apos;s accession to the WTO with Putin &apos;s first deputy , Igor Shuvalov , Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin , and Minister of Economy and Development Elvira Nabiullina . 
As late as June 3 , Putin had declared himself sure of Russia &apos;s &quot; swift joining of the WTO . &quot; 
The leaders of Belarus or Kazakhstan seemed equally surprised by Putin &apos;s statement , especially as Russia had just prohibited almost all imports of dairy products from Belarus in a protectionist ploy . 
After 16 years of negotiations , Russia appeared poised to join the WTO within a couple of months . 
Indeed , only three difficult hurdles remained . 
First , Ukraine demands a bilateral protocol on market access , which would force Russia to abolish roughly 100 trade sanctions , primarily in agriculture . 
The second obstacle is border controls with Georgia , a mainly political issue : whether Abkhazia and South Ossetia are independent , as Russia maintains , or are part Georgia , as the rest of the world believes . 
Finally , the EU insists that Russia abolish planned prohibitive export tariffs on lumber . 
Only the Georgian issue is really serious . 
A customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is no alternative to Russia &apos;s WTO accession . 
No countries have ever entered the WTO collectively , nor is this legally possible says WTO head Pascal Lamy . 
Moreover , while the customs union was proclaimed in 1995 , the earliest it can be formed is in July 2011 , which is unlikely . 
Predominantly a commodity exporter , Russia has less need for the WTO than a manufacturer like China . 
Even so , one-fifth of Russia &apos;s exports comprise metals and chemicals that are sensitive to anti-dumping measures . 
A series of World Bank and Russian studies have estimated that Russia can gain 0.5-1.0 percentage points in economic growth for half a decade if it joins the WTO . 
Membership is also important for Russia &apos;s international standing . 
It is the only G-20 country outside of the WTO , which accounts for 96 % of global trade . 
The WTO also represents a choice of economic and political strategy . 
Before Putin resigned as president in May 2008 , he presented his &quot; Russia 2020 &quot; program . 
In their rhetoric , President Dmitri Medvedev and his technocrats embrace this vision . 
But Putin and his siloviki ( political allies whose power base is in the security apparatus ) seem to prefer an &quot; inertia strategy , &quot; the worst of the Russia 2020 scenarios . 
This strategy amounts to state capitalism , living on Russia &apos;s energy wealth , and doing nothing to curtail Russia &apos;s massive red tape and corruption . 
By reversing course on the WTO , Putin has again shown himself to be Russia &apos;s master . 
He did the same thing last summer by lashing out against a successful mining and metallurgical company , Mechel , and provoking the war in Georgia . 
During the winter , Putin &apos;s poor policy choices on the financial crisis undermined his power . 
Rather than shielding Russia &apos;s private enterprises , he engineered a domestic liquidity freeze , which led to a sharp drop in GDP of 9.5 % in the first quarter of 2009 , despite Russia &apos;s huge foreign reserves . 
The pragmatic technocrats took over , but the subsequent doubling of oil prices signals that the danger for Russia &apos;s economy is over for now , so the siloviki are resuming command . 
The question is what their next step will be . 
The prominent Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer insists that their prime aim is to finish off Georgia and its president , Mikheil Saakashvili , who remains in power and defiant . 
Georgia has received no military support and is virtually undefended . 
The Kremlin continues its propaganda offensive against Georgia , and has vetoed prolonging the mandate for United Nations observers in Georgia and Abkhazia . 
A major Russian military maneuver , Caucasus 2009 , is underway . 
The last such maneuver , Caucasus 2008 , was followed by the invasion of Georgia . 
During the latter part of this maneuver , July 6-8 , US President Barack Obama is supposed to meet President Medvedev in Moscow . 
Medvedev obviously hopes to reach out and improve Russia &apos;s and his own standing in the world . 
The siloviki , however , prefer Russia isolated and authoritarian , with power securely in their hands . 
The Kremlin wants a new strategic arms control agreement , but the siloviki desire nothing more . 
Obama &apos;s administration had hoped for a final breakthrough in Russia &apos;s WTO talks , but Putin &apos;s actions have eliminated prospects for such an outcome . 
The US also wants progress on the territorial integrity of former Soviet states , such as Georgia , but that , too , is unlikely . 
Putin or his collaborators seem to be setting up Medvedev for a failure , suggesting that their jealousy of Medvedev &apos;s limited power is greater than their interest in defending Russia &apos;s national interests . 
Yet there is still hope that Putin encounters a sufficiently negative reaction that he changes his stance on WTO accession . 
After all , he suspended Russia &apos;s WTO accession talks after the August 2008 war in Georgia , only to allow them to restart this spring .
