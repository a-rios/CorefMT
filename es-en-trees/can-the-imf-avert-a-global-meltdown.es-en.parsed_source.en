Can the IMF Avert a Global Meltdown ? 
When world financial leaders meet in Singapore this month for the joint World Bank / International Monetary Fund meetings , they must confront one singularly important question . 
Is there any way to coax the IMF &apos;s largest members , especially the United States and China , to help diffuse the risks posed by the world &apos;s massive trade imbalances ? 
This year , the US will borrow roughly $ 800 billion to finance its trade deficit . 
Incredibly , the US is now soaking up roughly two-thirds of all global net saving , a situation without historical precedent . 
While this borrowing binge might end smoothly , as US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has speculated , most world financial leaders are rightly worried about a more precipitous realignment that would likely set off a massive dollar depreciation and possibly much worse . 
Indeed , if policymakers continue to sit on their hands , it is not hard to imagine a sharp global slowdown or even a devastating financial crisis . 
Although Bernanke is right to view a soft landing as the most likely outcome , common sense would suggest agreing on some prophylactic measures , even if this means that the US , China , and other large contributors to the global imbalances have to swallow some bitter medicine . 
Unfortunately , getting politicians in the big countries to focus on anything but their own domestic imperatives is far from easy . 
Though the comparison is unfair , it is hard not to recall the old quip about the IMF &apos;s relative , the United Nations : &quot; When there is a dispute between two small nations , the UN steps in and the dispute disappears . 
When there is a dispute between a small nation and a large nation , the UN steps in and the small nation disappears . 
When there is a dispute between two large nations , the UN disappears . &quot; 
Fortunately , the IMF is not yet in hiding , even if some big players really don &apos;t like what it has to say . 
The IMF &apos;s head , the Spaniard Rodrigo Rato , rightly insists that China , the US , Japan , Europe , and the major oil exporters ( now the world &apos;s biggest source of new capital ) all take concrete steps towards alleviating the risk of a crisis . 
Though the exact details remain to be decided , such steps might include more exchange-rate flexibility in China , and perhaps a promise from the US to show greater commitment to fiscal restraint . 
Oil exporters could , in turn , promise to increase domestic consumption expenditure , which would boost imports . 
Likewise , post-deflation Japan could promise never again to resort to massive intervention to stop its currency from appreciating . 
Europe , for its part , could agree not to shoot its recovery in the foot with ill-timed new taxes such as those that Germany is currently contemplating . 
Will the IMF be successful in brokering a deal ? 
The recent catastrophic collapse of global trade talks is not an encouraging harbinger . 
Europe , Japan , and ( to a much lesser extent ) the US , were simply unwilling to face down their small but influential farm lobbies . 
The tragic result is that some of the world &apos;s poorest countries cannot export their agricultural goods , one of the few areas where they might realistically compete with the likes of China and India . 
Fortunately for Rato , addressing the global imbalances can be a win-win situation . 
The same proposed policies for closing global trade imbalances also , by and large , help address each country &apos;s domestic economic concerns . 
For example , China needs a stronger exchange rate to help curb manic investment in its export sector , and thereby reduce the odds of a 1990 &quot; s style collapse . 
As for the US , a sharp hike in energy taxes on gasoline and other fossil fuels would not only help improve the government &apos;s balance sheet , but it would also be a way to start addressing global warming . 
What better way for new US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , a card-carrying environmentalist , to make a dramatic entrance onto the world policy stage ? 
Similarly , the technocrats at the Bank of Japan surely realize that they could manage the economy far more effectively if they swore off anachronistic exchange-rate intervention techniques and switched whole-heartedly to modern interest-rate targeting rules such as those used by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank . 
With Europe in a cyclical upswing , tax revenues should start rising even without higher tax rates , so why risk strangling the continent &apos;s nascent recovery in the cradle ? 
Saudi Arabia , with its burgeoning oil revenues , could use a big deal to reinforce the country &apos;s image as a major anchor of global financial stability . 
If today &apos;s epic US borrowing does end in tears , and if world leaders fail to help the IMF get the job done , history will not treat them kindly . 
Instead , they will be blamed for not seeing an impending catastrophe that was staring them in the face . 
Let &apos;s hope that on this occasion in international diplomacy , the only thing that disappears are the massive global trade imbalances , and not the leaders and institutions that are supposed to deal with them .
