Biomedicine in Reverse 
LA JOLLA , CALIFORNIA - Pundits have long predicted that biology would dominate the twenty-first century , just as physics dominated the twentieth century . 
Will the &quot; century of biology &quot; turn out to be little more than a fantasy ? 
The problem largely comes down to a decrease in biomedical research-and-development expenditure . 
As it stands , roughly $ 270 billion is invested in the field each year , producing an impressive half-million research publications , but only 20-30 new medicines . 
The discrepancy between spending and output adheres to what has come to be known as &quot; Eroom &apos;s law &quot; - Moore &apos;s law in reverse . 
Moore &apos;s law observes the increase in computer processing power over time - specifically , that the number of transistors that can be placed cheaply on an integrated circuit doubles every 18-24 months . 
By contrast , Eroom &apos;s law charts the regress in new drug approvals , noting that the costs of developing a new medicine double roughly every nine years . 
This phenomenon is rooted in high rates of drug failure and lengthening technology cycles . 
The probability that a drug entering clinical trials will gain approval from the US Food and Drug Administration has dropped from 23.9 % in 1997 to 10.4 % today . 
While the first recombinant insulin in the 1980 &quot; s took less than a decade from testing to approval , monoclonal antibodies and gene therapy took more than 20 years to reach the same milestone . 
So far , pharmaceutical and biomedical research firms have responded to Eroom &apos;s law by cutting R &amp; D or moving it to less expensive sites in Asia , shifting their focus to less prevalent diseases , and sourcing innovation externally . 
As a result , growth in biomedical R &amp; D spending has declined from more than 9 % annually in the early 2000 &quot; s to less than 3 % today . 
The industry &apos;s ability to support R &amp; D budgets has already led to the closure of more than 30 major research sites . 
The United States bore the brunt of these closures , with biomedical R &amp; D expenditure declining by more than $ 12 billion from 2007 to 2012 . 
And Asia - where biomedical R &amp; D is growing rapidly , but from a small base - is unlikely to pick up the slack . 
Asian countries have tended to be reluctant to shoulder the cost of developing new medicines , with reimbursements falling far short of US levels , and their R &amp; D productivity will not match that of the US and Europe for several more years . 
Moreover , biomedical research firms are abandoning certain diseases in order to avoid the large-scale trials that they require , focusing instead on &quot; orphan diseases &quot; like cystic fibrosis , which demand smaller clinical trials that have a higher probability of success , leading to drugs that can cost more than $ 100,000 annually per patient . 
But , with insurers and payers worldwide becoming increasingly vigilant about controlling costs , this business model &apos;s long-term prospects are unclear . 
Finally , while drugs are increasingly produced by small companies that larger pharmaceutical firms then acquire , funding for these start-ups is drying up . 
Likewise , universities - the main source of biomedical innovation - are facing dwindling budgets . 
Restoring funding for basic biomedical research appears to have lost favor with policymakers , because it does not offer immediate self-sustaining economic returns . 
With no panacea in sight , several other solutions are gaining traction . 
To maximize investment , the public and private sectors are increasingly pooling resources . 
For example , under the Accelerating Medicines Partnership , the NIH and ten biopharmaceutical companies will fund a five-year effort to validate promising targets in three disease areas . 
Other initiatives include efforts in Alzheimer &apos;s research to test competing drugs against one shared &quot; placebo arm &quot; in clinical trials , and in cancer research to test multiple therapies in a single trial and identify the most responsive patients . 
These pooled resources will be directed to a few high-priority diseases , identified through an evaluation of the marginal benefit of additional R &amp; D. Japan &apos;s focused strategy to champion stem-cell R &amp; D should serve as a model for other countries . 
At the same time , governments will have to implement policies aimed at guiding investment toward specific diseases . 
For example , increased NIH funding , extended market exclusivity , and relaxed regulatory hurdles in the US resulted in a renaissance in antibiotic drug development . 
Society will also have to share the cost of drug development . 
Regulatory agencies worldwide may follow the United Kingdom &apos;s lead in embracing adaptive licensing . 
Under this approach , drugs are conditionally approved and marketed , with the revenue generated following the conditional approval covering the costly trial for proving efficacy . 
Such a scheme facilitates lower drug pricing , while overcoming the effect of Eroom &apos;s law on investment in treatments for many diseases . 
Whether these efforts will succeed in putting biomedical research on a more sustainable footing remains an open question . 
This could still turn out to be biology &apos;s century .
