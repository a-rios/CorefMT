The Power Gap 
It is no surprise that President Bush &apos;s tour of Europe has been greeted by protests from Berlin to Rome . 
What is surprising is that , given the differences now arising between the US and its allies - the word schism might not be inappropriate - Mr. Bush &apos;s meetings with Europe &apos;s leaders proceeded so smoothly . 
Those disagreements are not only about Israel , or US tariffs on steel imports from the EU , or the possibility of American courts imposing the death penalty on suspected terrorists who carry European passports ; they increasingly embody a fundamentally different vision about how the world should work . 
During the Cold War , when the West feared attack by the Soviet bloc , the US and Europe were united through NATO in standing up to that threat . 
Today , when the central fear in Western countries is of international instability and terrorism , the NATO allies are far less united in how to respond . 
This is partly a question of trans-Atlantic differences in the levels of defense spending , and therefore of military capability . 
The US spends far more on defense than its European allies , and as a result its military capability is different in quality as well as in quantity . 
We saw the consequences of that gap in Afghanistan . 
Article 5 of the NATO Treaty was invoked as if the Twin Towers attack was an attack on the whole alliance . 
Many expected that America would call for a collective NATO response . 
Instead the Bush administration decided to wage the war essentially on its own ; for this kind of small war , it really did not need its European allies , although in the latter stages of the fighting , French Mirage jets , and British , German , Danish , and Norwegian special forces troops were active in battles in the mountains along the Afghanistan / Pakistan border . 
With America &apos;s planned defense budget increases , the trans-Atlantic gap in military capability will become a chasm . 
Gradually , effective military cooperation between the US and Europe will shift from being unnecessary and unwelcome , to being impossible . 
It may be argued that the Europeans should try to close this chasm , by increasing their own defense spending . 
Perhaps they should ; but there are two problems . 
The first problem is that European NATO consists of 16 separate countries , 16 separate defense budgets , and 16 separate defense forces . 
Even if they were , collectively , to match America &apos;s defense spending , they could not match US defense capability unless they combined their defense spending in a single budget . 
So Europe cannot begin to match the US unless it becomes a single federation . 
The second , more important problem , is that ( for a variety of reasons ) Europeans do not set as high a value as the US on purely military capability . 
Not all of these reasons are admirable : during the Cold War some European allies became accustomed to freeloading on America ; some were double freeloaders by choosing neutrality . 
But freeloading is not the whole story . 
From Washington , the past half-century may look like the story of a victorious Cold War against an outside enemy ; but from Europe , it looks more like the story of a slow , unremitting effort to find political , economic , legal and institutional alternatives to military power as a way of tackling geo-political problems . 
For hundreds if not thousands of years , European countries made war repeatedly with each other . 
In the first half of the 20th century they succeeded in turning these conflicts into two World Wars , and Europe into a charnel house . 
After WWII , they tried an entirely new tack , with the great experiment of European integration and institution building . 
This institution building is far from complete , but the process transformed European attitudes . 
Europeans are now irrevocably committed to peaceful solutions for their own international problems , and they increasingly think that peaceful solutions , or at least partly peaceful solutions , will be useful for other peoples &apos; conflicts . 
The present US administration , by contrast , seems to put a much higher priority on war and the rhetoric of war . 
We see this contrast being acted out on the ground . 
In the Balkans , bombing was carried out mainly by the US ; peacekeeping mainly by Europeans . 
There are , of course , local reasons why the Europeans set a high priority on peacekeeping and reconstruction in the Balkans . 
War in these countries is a direct threat to Europe &apos;s interests and stability , so European governments have a direct interest in promoting peace . 
Moreover , EU governments decided that all these countries , like those in Central and Eastern Europe , are legitimate candidates for membership in the EU . 
Therefore , it is in the EU &apos;s interest to help them qualify in terms of political , civil and economic stability . 
It is this prospect of a massive enlargement that defines the central challenge facing the EU : how to strengthen its institutions to be able to handle a Union whose membership will expand from 15 to 27 countries - perhaps more . 
That is the subject of the EU Convention now underway in Brussels , and which is designed to pave the way for a new treaty-making conference next year . 
If EU governments are able to strengthen central political institutions , enlargement may be successful ; if not , it may be blocked . 
Moreover , with stronger central institutions , the EU may start to make progress in developing a more coherent European Security and Defense Policy . 
But nobody should imagine that Europeans are ever likely to share the priority attached by America to the value of military power .
