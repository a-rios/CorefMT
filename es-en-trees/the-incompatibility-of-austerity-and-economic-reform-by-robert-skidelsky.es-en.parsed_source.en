Economic Rebalancing Acts 
LONDON - We all know how the global economic crisis began . 
The banks over-lent to the housing market . 
The subsequent burst of the housing bubble in the United States caused banks to fail , because banking had gone global and the big banks held one another &apos;s bad loans . 
Banking failure caused a credit crunch . 
Lending dried up and economies started shrinking . 
So governments bailed out banks and economies , producing a sovereign debt crisis . 
With everyone busy deleveraging , economies failed to recover . 
Much of the world , especially Europe , but also the slightly less sickly US , remains stuck in a semi-slump . 
So how do we escape from this hole ? 
The familiar debate is between austerity and stimulus . 
&quot; Austerians &quot; believe that only balancing government budgets and shrinking national debts will restore investor confidence . 
The Keynesians believe that without a large fiscal stimulus - a deliberate temporary increase of the deficit - the European and US economies will remain stuck in recession for years to come . 
I am one of those who believe that recovery from the crisis requires fiscal stimulus . 
I don &apos;t think monetary policy , even unorthodox monetary policy , can do the job . 
Confidence is too low for commercial banks to create credit on the scale needed to return to full employment and the pre-crisis growth trend , however many hundreds of billions of whatever cash central banks pour into them . 
We are learning all over again that the central bank cannot create whatever level of credit it wants ! 
So , like Paul Krugman , Martin Wolf , and others , I would expand fiscal deficits , not try to shrink them . 
I advocate this for the old-fashioned Keynesian reason that we are suffering from a deficiency of aggregate demand , that the multiplier is positive , and that the most effective way to reduce the private and public debts a year or two down the line is by taking steps to boost growth in national income now . 
But the argument between austerians and Keynesians over how to encourage sustained recovery intersects with another debate . 
Simply put , what kind of post-recovery economy do we want ? 
This is where economics becomes political economy . 
Those who believe that all was fine with the pre-crisis economy except for banks making crazy loans are convinced that preventing such crises in the future requires only banking reform . 
The new reform orthodoxy is &quot; macro-prudential regulation &quot; of commercial banks by the central bank . 
Some would go further and either nationalize the banks or break them up . 
But their horizon of reform is similarly confined to the banking sector , and they rarely ask what caused the banks to behave so badly . 
In fact , it is possible to regard excessive bank lending as a symptom of deeper economic flaws . 
The economist Thomas Palley sees it as a means of offsetting growth in income inequality , with access to cheap credit replacing the broken welfare guarantee of social democracy . 
So reform requires redistribution of wealth and incomes . 
Redistributive measures go quite well with stimulus policies , because they may be expected to increase aggregate demand in the short term ( owing to lower-income households &quot; higher propensity to consume ) and minimize the economy &apos;s dependence on debt financing in the long term . 
Initial damage to the confidence of the business class caused by higher taxes on the wealthy would be balanced by the prospect of higher overall consumption . 
Others argue that we should try to rebalance the economy not just from rich to poor , but also from energy-wasting to energy-saving . 
The premise of the green economic agenda is that we have reached the ecological limits of our current growth model , and that we will need to find ways of living that reduce demands on non-renewable sources of energy . 
So stimulus policies should aim to stimulate not just demand per se ; they must focus , instead , on stimulating ecologically-friendly demand . 
For example , greens advocate free municipal transport in major cities . 
In general , they argue , we need more care , not more cars , so stimulus money should go to health , education , and the protection of the environment . 
The truth is that any fiscally-driven recovery policy is bound to have reformist implications . 
That is why the austerians are so against it , and why even those who accept the theoretical case for a stimulus insist on implementing it through monetary policy alone . 
Re-balancing the economy from gas-guzzling to energy-saving - and from private to public consumption - is bound to alter the goal of economic policy . 
Maximizing GDP growth will no longer be the top priority ; rather , it should be something we might want to call &quot; happiness , &quot; or &quot; well-being , &quot; or the &quot; good life . &quot; 
The radical case is that the pre-crisis economy crashed not because of preventable mistakes in banking , but because money had become the sole arbiter of value . 
So we should be energetic in seeking recovery , but not in a way that simply reproduces the structural flaws of the past . 
As Dani Rodrik has well put it : &quot; If economics were only about profit maximization , it would be just another name for business administration . 
It is a social discipline , and society has other means of cost accounting beside market prices . &quot;
