Is America Catching the &quot; British Disease ? &quot; 
BERKELEY - In the United States , the scent of decline is in the air . 
Imperial overreach , political polarization , and a costly financial crisis are weighing on the economy . 
Some pundits now worry that America is about to succumb to the &quot; British disease . &quot; 
Doomed to slow growth , the US of today , like the exhausted Britain that emerged from World War II , will be forced to curtail its international commitments . 
This will create space for rising powers like China , but it will also expose the world to a period of heightened geopolitical uncertainty . 
In thinking about these prospects , it is important to understand the nature of the British disease . It was not simply that America and Germany grew faster than Britain after 1870 . 
After all , it is entirely natural for late-developing countries to grow rapidly , as is true of China today . 
The problem was Britain &apos;s failure in the late nineteenth century to take its economy to the next level . 
Britain was slow to move from the old industries of the first Industrial Revolution into modern sectors like electrical engineering , which impeded the adoption of mass-production methods . 
It also failed to adopt precision machinery that depended on electricity , which prevented it from producing machined components for use in assembling typewriters , cash registers , and motor vehicles . 
The same story can be told about other new industries like synthetic chemicals , dyestuffs , and telephony , in all of which Britain failed to establish a foothold . 
The rise of new economic powers with lower costs made employment loss in old industries like textiles , iron and steel , and shipbuilding inevitable . 
But Britain &apos;s signal failure was in not replacing these old nineteenth-century industries with new twentieth-century successors . 
Is America doomed to the same fate ? 
Answering this question requires understanding the reasons behind Britain &apos;s lack of technological progressiveness . 
One popular explanation is a culture that denigrated industry and entrepreneurship . 
Over the long course of British modernization , the industrial classes were absorbed into the establishment . 
From the mid-nineteenth century , the best minds went into politics , not business . 
Enterprise managers promoted from the shop floor were , it is said , second rate . 
Now we supposedly see a similar problem in the US . 
In the words of David Brooks of The New York Times : &quot; After decades of affluence , the US has drifted away from the hardheaded practical mentality that built the nation &apos;s wealth in the first place .... America &apos;s brightest minds have been abandoning industry and technical enterprise in favor of more prestigious but less productive fields like law , finance , consulting , and nonprofit activism . &quot; 
In fact , this supposed explanation for British decline has not stood the test of time . 
There is no systematic evidence that British managers were inferior . 
Indeed , expanding the pool of potential managers beyond the children of a firm &apos;s founders had precisely the opposite effect . 
It allowed the cream to rise to the top . 
In today &apos;s America , too , it is hard to find evidence of this purported problem . 
Silicon Valley companies do not complain of a dearth of talented managers . 
There is no shortage of new MBAs establishing start-ups or even going to work for auto companies . 
A second popular explanation for British decline focuses on the educational system . 
Oxford and Cambridge , established long before the industrial era , produced eminent philosophers and historians , but too few scientists and engineers . 
It is difficult , however , to see how this argument applies to the US , whose universities remain world leaders , attracting graduate students in science and engineering from around the world - many of whom remain in the country . 
Still others explain British decline as a function of the financial system . 
British banks , having grown up in the early nineteenth century , when industry &apos;s capital needs were modest , specialized in financing foreign trade rather than domestic investment , thereby starving industry of the capital needed to grow . 
In fact , actual evidence of any such British bias in favor of foreign over domestic investment is weak . 
And , in any case , that history , too , is irrelevant to the US today , which is on the receiving , not the sending , end of foreign investment . 
A final explanation for Britain &apos;s failure to keep up makes economic policy the culprit . 
Britain failed to put in place an effective competition policy . 
In response to the collapse of demand in 1929 , it erected high tariff walls . 
Sheltered from foreign competition , industry grew fat and lazy . 
After WWII , repeated shifts between Labour and Conservative governments led to stop-go policies that heightened uncertainty and created chronic financial problems . 
Herein lies the most convincing explanation for British decline . 
The country failed to develop a coherent policy response to the financial crisis of the 1930 &quot; s . 
Its political parties , rather than working together to address pressing economic problems , remained at each other &apos;s throats . 
The country turned inward . 
Its politics grew fractious , its policies erratic , and its finances increasingly unstable . 
In short , Britain &apos;s was a political , not an economic , failure . 
And that history , unfortunately , is all too pertinent to America &apos;s fate .
