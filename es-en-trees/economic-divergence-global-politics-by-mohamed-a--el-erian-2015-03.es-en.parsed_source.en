The Messy Politics of Economic Divergence 
LAGUNA BEACH - The world is increasingly characterized by divergence - in economic performance , monetary policy , and thus in financial markets . 
Global divergence has already contributed to stock-market volatility , unprecedented declines in advanced economies &apos; government bond yields , and outsize currency movements . 
And the trend is not abating , placing increasing pressure on already-strained political systems . 
The world &apos;s systemically important economies can be placed into four categories . 
The first group includes countries like India and the United States , where economic recovery is broadening , enabling them to overcome financial imbalances . 
The second group is exemplified by China , which is achieving a soft landing onto a growth path that , while lower than in recent years , remains adequate to support continued progress toward high-income status and financial stability . 
The third group includes economies - such as Brazil , several eurozone countries , and Japan - that are not growing fast enough , and face downside risks . 
This divergence is as much a political phenomenon as it is an economic and financial one . 
Overcoming it - and ensuring steady , financially stable global growth - will require responsive national policymaking and multilateral coordination . 
Unfortunately , today &apos;s rather messy national and international political environments have so far precluded such an approach . 
Nonetheless , experimental monetary policies in advanced economies - such as the large-scale asset purchases initiated this month by the European Central Bank - have slowed the vicious circle of subpar economic performance and muddled politics . 
Moreover , market forces have gained an ever-larger role in reconciling global economic divergence , leading to dramatic shifts in exchange rates . 
The list of such currency movements - which so far has included the euro &apos;s 25 % fall against the dollar , a record low for the Mexican peso , and disorderly depreciations of the Brazilian real and other emerging-economy currencies - is getting longer by the day . 
Even healthy economies like South Korea are keen to weaken their currencies , leaving the US alone in its willingness to tolerate significant currency appreciation . 
On their own , currency markets will not bring about the growth-enhancing global economic rebalancing that is needed . 
Better policies at the national , regional , and global levels are also essential - and that requires better politics . 
Too many political leaders around the world remain unable - or unwilling - to fulfill their economic-governance responsibilities . 
This is particularly regrettable , given that there is a broad consensus regarding the technical components of the required policy response : structural reforms to revamp growth engines , efforts to rebalance aggregate demand , and the elimination of debt overhangs . 
( The eurozone must also work to complete the essential underpinnings of its historic integration project . ) 
What is missing is implementation . 
But governments seem unlikely to overcome their dysfunction anytime soon . 
In the US , Congress and the executive branch are locked in a stalemate . 
Europe &apos;s political systems are being shaken by the rise of populist parties , many of which are winning support with an anti-European platform . 
In the emerging world , Brazil &apos;s government has faced multiple corruption scandals . 
In most , if not all , of these cases , we see examples of a broader phenomenon : what might be called governing by inertia - a &quot; can &apos;t , won &apos;t , and shouldn &apos;t &quot; mentality , to paraphrase the economist Mark Blyth , that blocks effective policymaking . 
As policy inertia prolongs sluggish growth and impairs job creation , it becomes even more difficult to abandon . 
Given how hard it is for governments to initiate a shift to a new policymaking mode ( that is , to disrupt themselves ) , pressure will build from the outside . 
In a democracy , this tends to occur through the fragmentation of traditional parties and the emergence of non-traditional parties - some offering genuine alternatives , and others relying on fear and prejudice . 
The global economy is at a critical juncture . 
Most economists agree on what is needed to avoid another round of lost growth opportunities , inadequate employment , financial instability , and worsening inequality . 
Central banks and markets cannot achieve an orderly global rebalancing on their own . 
As difficult as it may be , politicians need to pursue comprehensive policy responses . 
The longer they delay , the less effective their efforts will be . 
As bad politics block economic opportunity , public trust in governments will continue to erode - with serious potential consequences for political systems , and the economies they administer , worldwide .
