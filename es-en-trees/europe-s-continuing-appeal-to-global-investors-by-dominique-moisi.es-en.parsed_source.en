The European Oasis 
PARIS - Are non-Europeans much less pessimistic about Europe than Europeans themselves ? 
Could distance be a prerequisite for a more balanced view of the continent &apos;s predicament ? 
In an interview a few months ago , Wang Hongzhang , the chairman of China Construction Bank , indirectly expressed his subdued enthusiasm for Europe . 
Quoting the Chinese proverb , &quot; A starved camel is still bigger than a horse , &quot; he went on to say that Europe &apos;s economies are much stronger than many people believe . 
And , without saying so explicitly , he suggested that the time was right to go on a European buying spree at the right price . 
Of course , not everyone would share this optimistic vision . 
Across the English Channel , British Euroskeptics rejoice that they have kept their distance from a &quot; sinking ship . &quot; 
But , while The Economist recently described France as being &quot; in denial , &quot; the same could be said of the United Kingdom . 
True , the French had neither the Olympic Games nor a royal celebration this year ; but , when it comes to the state of their economies , the two countries are largely in the same boat . 
If one travels to America or Asia , as I did this autumn , Europe &apos;s image becomes selectively brighter : while it continues to be perceived as a positive model , it is no longer considered a global actor . 
Seen from the United States , Europe may no longer be a problem , but it is not considered a part of any solution to the world &apos;s problems , either - with the possible exception of those that concern Europe directly ( and , even then , doubts linger ) . 
Yet , for many international investors , Europe continues to be , or is once again , a risk worth taking , if not - as in the case of Wang - a golden opportunity . 
In a time of growing complexity - and thus uncertainty - investors want to hedge their bets . 
At least some of the BRICS countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) appear to be running out of steam economically ; and , while new emerging powers , such as Mexico , are tempting , they may prove to be more fragile than they look . 
In this context , Europe may be a tired , aging , and depressed continent , but , as its luxury and aeronautics industries attest , it would be premature to bury it . 
Relative decline is obvious : Europe accounted for 20 % of the world &apos;s population at the beginning of the eighteenth century , but only around 7 % today , while its share is expected to be even lower in 2050 . 
But demography is not destiny : a small population has not prevented Singapore from sustaining a hyper-competitive economy . 
Europe may not be a source of economic inspiration , but it still makes people dream . 
It is perceived as a model of &quot; civility . &quot; 
Whatever their other disagreements , Chinese and Japanese concur on one point : if Asia today , with its rising nationalist tensions , evokes Europe in the first half of the twentieth century , it is precisely because Asia has not embarked on a reconciliation process such as that which enabled France and Germany to transcend their centuries-old rivalry . 
Likewise , Russia &apos;s president , Vladimir Putin , may emphasize the specificity of &quot; Russian civilization &quot; in a manner evocative of nineteenth-century anti-Western thinkers ; but many in the Russian elite still consider the European Union , despite its many weaknesses , the most civilized model of governance that exists . 
When Chinese seek a benchmark model for social protection , they go on study trips to Scandinavia . 
But can Europe remain a model if it is no longer a serious geopolitical actor ? 
When US officials say to the Europeans , &quot; We need you , &quot; what they mean is quite minimal : &quot; Please do not collapse and bring down the global economy with you . &quot; 
Europeans have become the Japanese of the West - financial contributors who at best play a supporting role in global strategic affairs . 
For example , if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can still be resolved , a solution can come only with strong US involvement . 
Barack Obama , who wants to be a transformative president like his role model , Abraham Lincoln , could do worse to deserve the Nobel Peace Prize that he received prematurely than to facilitate a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement . 
Few expect such a colossal achievement , of course , but far fewer expect anything remotely similar from Catherine Ashton , the EU &apos;s foreign policy czarina , or , for that matter , any European leader . 
Europe remains a significant economic and commercial actor - one that can rebound at any time , now that it has at least partly transcended its systemic crisis . 
It also remains a model of reconciliation in which people can continue to dream , despite unacceptably high levels of unemployment , particularly among the young . 
But Europe is no longer perceived as a global actor - and rightly so . 
It is an oasis of peace , if not dynamism . 
The question for Europeans today is whether they can - and , more important , should - be content with their status .
