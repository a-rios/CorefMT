Twenty Years After the Wall 
BERLIN - Those who witnessed that night 20 years ago in Berlin , or elsewhere in Germany , will never forget what happened - the night the Wall came down . 
History in the making is all too often tragic . 
November 9 , 1989 , was one of those rare moments when irony reigned , because East Germany &apos;s bureaucratic socialism died as it had lived - with a bureaucratic snafu . 
The Speaker of the Politburo , GÃ¼nter Schabowski , had simply misunderstood that body &apos;s decision and , by releasing to the public incorrect information about the lifting of travel restrictions , triggered the fall of the Wall ! 
Groucho Marx could not have bettered Schabowski that night . 
It was Germany &apos;s happiest hour . 
Twenty years later , many revolutionary consequences of that night lie behind us . 
The Soviet Union and its empire quietly disappeared , and with them the Cold War international order . 
Eastern Europe and the states on the Soviet periphery won their independence ; 
In Afghanistan , war continued under different circumstances , with serious ramifications for the region and , indeed , the world . 
As the victorious heir to the collapsed Cold War order , the United States stood alone , undisputed , at the peak of its global power . 
But , within two decades - following the war in Iraq and financial and economic crisis - the US had squandered that special status . 
Arrogance of power and blindness about reality were the two main causes for the decline of the sole remaining superpower . 
While most of the blame lies with George W. Bush , numerous negative trends had preceded him . 
He merely took them to the extreme . 
After September11 , 2001 , the US had a second big chance to use its unique power to reorganize the world . 
After this terrible crime , countries - including in the Arab world - were ready to embrace far-reaching steps . 
At that moment , peace between Palestinians and Israelis could have been achieved , and thus a new beginning made in the Middle East . 
Even a radical about-face in US energy policy , with the introduction of energy taxes , would have been possible under the banner of national security . 
The challenge posed by global climate change could have been addressed more effectively that way . 
But that opportunity , too , was thrown away . 
Europe - and , within it , Germany - were among the big winners of November 9 , 1989 . 
The Continent reunited in liberty : Germany on October 3 , 1990 ; 
Europe with the great European Union enlargement of May 1 , 2004 . 
The introduction of a common European currency was successful ; political integration by means of a constitutional treaty a failure . 
Since then , the EU has been stagnating , both internally and externally . 
Europe has made only insufficient use of its opportunities since 1989 - and could dramatically lose influence in the emerging power structure of the twenty-first century . 
In Germany , which largely owes its reunification to its firm roots in the EU and NATO , Europe-weariness is palpable . 
The generation ruling in Berlin today increasingly thinks in national rather than European terms . 
This was never more obvious than in the deciding days and weeks of the global financial crisis . 
Russia , the big loser of 1989 , remains two decades later mired in a mix of social and economic depression and political regression and illusion . 
Life expectancy continues to decline ; investment in infrastructure , research , and education are stunted ; the economy is barely able to compete internationally ; and the social divide between poor and rich is deepening . 
Economically , Russia has turned into a commodity exporter , dependant on the imponderables of the global energy market , while simultaneously dreaming that it can use energy as a tool to revise the post-Soviet order in its neighborhood . 
Russia &apos;s elites still largely think in the power categories of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . 
Russia &apos;s desire to reclaim its role as a powerful global player is understandable and legitimate . 
November 9 , 1989 , marked not only the end of the Cold War era , but also the beginning of a new wave of globalization . 
The real winners of this new world order are the large emerging countries , first and foremost China and India , which increasingly set the pace of global economic and political development . 
The G-8 has been dismissed by history as a club of Western industrial nations ; its place has been taken by the G-20 , which conceals the underlying formula of power distribution within the new world order : the G-2 ( China and the US ) . 
All these changes reflect a dramatic transfer of power from West to East , from Europe and America to Asia , which within the next two decades is likely to bring to an end 400 years of Eurocentrism . 
The past two decades also have seen the world begin to reach its ecological limits . 
The majority of humanity has sought since November 9 , 1989 , to achieve Western living standards at all costs , overstretching our planet &apos;s climate and ecosystems . 
The years since the Berlin Wall came down have been rich in dramatic change , but the real era of upheaval lies ahead . 
Global warming is only the tip of the iceberg towards which we are moving , knowingly , with eyes wide open . 
What matters now is that states act globally and in unison . 
Twenty years after Berlin , Copenhagen is calling .
