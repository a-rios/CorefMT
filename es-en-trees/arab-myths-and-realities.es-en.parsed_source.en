Arab Myths and Realities 
WASHINGTON , DC - With Hosni Mubarak &apos;s ouster in Egypt - widely considered to have one of the region &apos;s most stable regimes until only recently - and Colonel Muammar Qaddafi clinging to power in Libya , there is no clear end in sight to the turmoil sweeping across the Arab world . 
Protests have already toppled governments in Tunisia and Egypt , leaving other Arab countries faced with widespread discontent . 
The unrest caught most people by surprise - both inside and outside the region - and has fundamentally upended at least five conventional beliefs about the Arab world . 
Arabs don &apos;t go into the street . 
Before the protests began in Egypt and Tunisia , many people argued that there was no real urgency to political reform , and that those who were calling for change did not understand the public mood - things weren &apos;t as bad as the dissidents made them out to be . 
This line of thinking led governments to believe that Arabs would not demonstrate in large numbers and demand change . 
In each country , rapid reform was seen as detrimental to national interests . 
This argument clearly is no longer tenable . 
No one predicted what happened in Egypt and Tunisia , which means that no Arab country is immune . 
Governments don &apos;t have the luxury of waiting forever , and they can no longer use the myth of popular quiescence to avoid initiating the necessary reforms that will address the public &apos;s underlying grievances . 
Economic liberalization should precede political reform . 
Arab governments - and many Westerners - claimed that privatization and other economic reforms should be given priority over political change . 
Instead , the benefits of privatization and other initiatives went largely to political and business elites . 
As a result , Arabs have come to view liberalization and globalization negatively . 
It is clear by now that economic reform must be coupled with political reform , so that institutional mechanisms of accountability are developed to monitor any excesses and ensure that benefits are made available to all . 
Governments have been quick to believe that the protests are fundamentally about high prices and unemployment , but the issue that unites Arab discontent is inadequate governance . 
Closed systems are necessary to prevent Islamists from taking power . 
The West is often afraid that democracy will give Islamists the opening they need to gain control - a fear that Arab regimes exploit to justify maintaining closed political systems . 
So it is untrue that the only viable alternative to unrelenting absolutist rule must be Islamist . 
The protests are clearly the result of ordinary citizens becoming fed up with corruption , the lack of any semblance of rule of law , and arbitrary treatment . 
There is an opportunity here to start developing pluralistic systems where not only Islamists , but also other parties and discourses can play a role . 
Elections equal democracy . 
No one is fooled by this claim anymore . 
In order to maintain their dominance , Arab governments have relied on flawed laws and elections that don &apos;t produce strong parliaments or lead to real change . 
Indeed , in countries like Egypt and Tunisia , government and parliament alike were unpopular . 
Throughout the region , elections have been used to create a fa√ßade of democracy aimed at impressing citizens and the outside world while insulating the regimes from pressure for genuine reform . 
The Arab public , however , will no longer accept the status quo . 
People will not be satisfied with economic handouts or cosmetic changes in governance ; they are demanding real change that puts their country on a clear path toward democracy . 
The international community has no role to play . 
While the reform process should certainly be homegrown , the United States and the rest of the international community can encourage democratic development without imposing it from afar . 
President Barack Obama rejected many of the policies of the George W. Bush administration that were seen as trying to force democracy on Arab countries . 
The US and the West can discuss with Arab countries how political reform should be carried out in a way that would contribute to greater openness and opportunities for power-sharing . 
The West should not sacrifice these objectives for others ; if allies ultimately lose power in popular revolts , such a tradeoff would not have furthered the West &apos;s interests , to say the least . 
The unfolding events grabbing headlines around the world have shattered key myths about the Arab world . 
These countries &quot; people need to start gradual , sustained , and serious political reform now . 
At the dawn of a new Arab era , it is up to them to build new , open political systems that can head off the looming threat of escalating crises .
