The Bitterness of Sugar 
PRINCETON - Sugar is sweet , but the ethics of its production is anything but appealing . 
&quot; Sugar Rush , &quot; a recent report released by Oxfam International as part of its &quot; Behind the Brands &quot; campaign , has shown that our use of sugar implicates us in land grabs that violate the rights of some of the world &apos;s poorest communities . 
Better-informed and more ethical consumers could change this . 
We are genetically programmed to like sweet things , and when people become more affluent , they consume more sugar . 
The resulting increase in sugar prices has led producers to seek more land on which to grow sugarcane . 
It is no surprise that the poor lose when their interests conflict with those of the rich and powerful . 
The Oxfam report provides several examples of producers who have acquired land without the consent of the people who live on it , turning farmers into landless laborers . 
Here is one . 
In the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco , a group of fishing families had lived since 1914 on islands in the Sirinhaém River estuary . 
In 1998 , the Usina Trapiche sugar refinery petitioned the state to take over the land . 
The islanders say that the refinery then followed up its petition by destroying their homes and small farms - and threatening further violence to those who did not leave . 
As recently as last year , the fishing families say , employees of the refinery burned down homes that had been rebuilt . 
Trapiche moved the families to a nearby town , where they gained access to electricity , water , sanitation , and schooling , but if they want to continue to fish , they have to travel a long distance . 
Many of them are still seeking to return to the islands . 
Both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo use Usina Trapiche sugar in their products . 
Does that make them responsible for the wrongs done to the people whose land Trapiche is using to produce that sugar ? 
In the 1990 &quot; s , Nike tried to wash its hands of responsibility for the use of child labor and other unconscionable labor practices in the factories that produced its sneakers . 
Likewise , McDonald &apos;s initial response to criticism of its suppliers &quot; animal-welfare practices was to sue the activists who made the allegations . 
But when two of them , with nothing to lose , defended themselves in court , the result was the longest libel trial in British legal history - and a public-relations disaster for the corporate giant . 
After the judge held that some of the activists &quot; claims were not defamatory , because they were true , McDonald &apos;s began to accept responsibility for its suppliers &quot; practices . 
It has since become a much-needed force for improvement in the treatment of animals used for food in the United States . 
More recently , the collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh earlier this year , which killed more than 1,000 people , posed a similar question for the garment industry . 
Associated British Foods ( ABF ) , which is both a major sugar producer and the owner of the retail clothing chain Primark , took responsibility for its suppliers by signing up , along with 80 other clothing brands , to a legally binding building-safety agreement supported by trade unions and the Bangladeshi government . 
What applies to the clothing industry should hold for the food industry , too - and not just for sugar , but for all food production . 
Oxfam is asking the ten biggest food brands to show leadership by acknowledging their responsibility for land-rights violations involving their suppliers . 
In particular , Oxfam wants these global companies to avoid buying from suppliers that have acquired land from small-scale food producers without these producers &quot; free , prior , and informed consent . 
Where land has already been acquired without such consent , and the acquisition is in dispute , Oxfam wants the corporations to insist on fair dispute-resolution procedures . 
&quot; Behind the Brands &quot; includes a score sheet , ranking the Big 10 on a range of issues , including their impact on workers , water , land , women , and climate change . 
On land issues , Oxfam rates PepsiCo , and ABF either &quot; poor &quot; or &quot; very poor . &quot; 
Nestlé scores better , because its guidelines for suppliers - used for the sourcing of sugar , soy , palm oil , and other commodities - require that they obtain the free , prior , and informed consent of indigenous and local communities before acquiring land . 
Nestlé was the first of the Big 10 to support this principle fully . 
Then , on November 7 , Coca-Cola responded to the Oxfam campaign by declaring that it would have &quot; zero tolerance &quot; for land grabbing by its suppliers and bottlers . 
Coca-Cola committed to disclosing the companies that supply it with sugar cane , soy , and palm oil , so that social , environmental , and human rights assessments can be conducted ; it will also engage with Usina Trapiche regarding the conflict with the fishing families of the Sirinhaém River estuary . 
Oxfam &apos;s advocacy is raising the standards for the global food industry . 
If PepsiCo and ABF want us to regard them as ethical producers , they need to follow the lead of Nestlé and now Coca-Cola , and accept responsibility for their suppliers &quot; conduct toward some of the world &apos;s poorest and most powerless people .
