Palestinian Hopes for Barack Obama 
RAMALLAH - President-elect Barack Obama &apos;s defiantly positive campaign for change has inspired hope not only in the millions of Americans who voted for him , but also in the billions of others worldwide who could not . 
Across the Middle East , as elsewhere , expectations are building that his presidency will herald a new era for America &apos;s role in the world . 
Palestinians identify strongly with the civil rights movement in the United States . 
Many recall the dark days when American society enforced racial segregation . 
That the same society elected an African-American president only a few decades later renews Palestinian hopes that , in our ongoing struggle for justice and freedom , we , too , shall overcome . 
Obama &apos;s electoral triumph arrives at a symbolic moment in Palestinian history . 
This month marks the twentieth anniversary of the Palestinian Declaration of Independence . 
Drafted by the poetic hand of my late friend , Mahmoud Darwish , the text is nothing short of visionary . 
Whereas previously the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) had campaigned for a single , secular , and democratic state across the entirety of mandatory Palestine , our Declaration of Independence endorsed a two-state solution . 
The depth of this compromise can be fully appreciated only in its historical context . 
In the war and violence that surrounded Israel &apos;s establishment in 1948 , our losses were immense . 
Over 726,000 Palestinian Christians and Muslims - the majority of the Arab population of mandatory Palestine - fled or were forced to leave their homes by Zionist militias . 
Over 400 Palestinian villages in what became Israel were destroyed or depopulated . 
Endorsing a two-state solution meant recognizing Israeli sovereignty over 78 % of our homeland and exercising our right to self-determination on only the remaining 22 % that Israel has occupied militarily since 1967 : the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , and the Gaza Strip . 
Yet we made this historic compromise because we believed that doing so would bring us to the threshold of liberty . 
Of course , that is not how things have turned out : Palestinians have been living under Israeli occupation for 41 years . 
As Obama prepares to enter the White House , we are confident that he will consider the constructive role America can play in the search for peace and security . 
In the year since Palestinians and Israelis renewed their commitment to their obligations under the &quot; road map , &quot; we may have failed to reach a conclusive settlement to our conflict , but that does not mean that the efforts made were in vain . 
With the determination of both sides , I am confident that we can reach a final agreement in relatively short order . 
The US can take four practical steps to help negotiations move forward immediately . 
The first step is early engagement . 
The Bush administration &apos;s efforts to assist our peace-making project faltered in part because our conflict was neglected during the early part of its tenure . 
Allowing this conflict to fester will only aggravate our peoples &quot; insecurity and our region &apos;s instability . 
Second , the US should establish a credible enforcement mechanism to ensure that the parties comply with their respective obligations , particularly an immediate freeze on Israeli settlement activity throughout the occupied Palestinian territory . 
Not only has Israel failed to halt its settlement activity since Annapolis - in violation of international law and its renewed road map commitments - but it has actually accelerated such activity . 
Construction of settlement housing units is over 45 % higher now than in the nine months prior to Annapolis . 
Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes have also increased , particularly in occupied East Jerusalem . 
Nothing undermines Palestinian faith in the peace process like watching the homes of our families flattened , while the architecture of our oppression is strengthened . 
Third , the new administration should encourage the re-engagement of its Quartet partners - the United Nations , the European Union , and Russia - in the mediation process . 
International cooperation is key to securing the legitimacy of negotiations , and it will be critical when the time comes for the enforcement and implementation of any agreement . 
The US cannot be expected to shoulder the post-conflict burdens of peacekeeping alone . 
Fourth , the US should renew its respect for international law by recognizing three principles : that the 1967 pre-occupation boundaries must be respected in any negotiations ; that Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem must be safeguarded , with guaranteed access for Muslims , Christians , and Jews to their holy sites ; and that the plight of Palestinian refugees , whose 60-year ordeal remains emblematic of the Palestinian predicament , must be acknowledged and fairly addressed . 
Fortunately , a framework already exists that supports these concerns . 
The 2002 Arab Peace Initiative offers Israel a unique opportunity : full normalization of relations with 57 Arab and Muslim states in return for a comprehensive peace agreement , including an end to Israel &apos;s occupation of Arab lands and a just and agreed upon solution for refugees . 
Our Declaration of Independence is now twenty years old . 
The Arab Peace Initiative has been collecting dust for over six years . 
Palestinian patience is not infinite . 
Some have already resigned themselves to believing a viable Palestinian state will never emerge . 
Others , like me , argue that we must not lose faith . 
But if we are to realize our dream of freedom and statehood -and prove the cynics wrong- we will need President Obama &apos;s help .
