Prepare Now for the Return of SARS 
Every winter , millions of people around the world suffering from flu-like illnesses visit their doctor . 
Some patients actually are infected with flu ; others have colds or other respiratory infections , many of which also peak in the winter . 
This coming flu season there will be a new twist : physicians will have to be aware that hidden among these patients could be a small number with SARS , a respiratory disease that is also likely to be seasonal and whose early symptoms are almost indistinguishable from those of the flu . 
If even a few SARS cases are present among the millions of flu-like cases that will appear this autumn , it will be critical to identify and isolate them to prevent a repeat of the epidemic that scourged China earlier this year . 
But among the vast number of flu and other cases , finding these cases will be difficult . 
Paradoxically , the best way for health authorities to prepare for a possible return of SARS this winter is to make special efforts to reduce the spread of flu and speed its diagnosis . 
This may be a tough sell politically . 
Unfortunately , if predictably , the remarkable success of efforts around the world to control the transmission of SARS - particularly in Taiwan and mainland China - has led some to question whether the threat of SARS was &quot; overblown . &quot; 
But the very reason we have the luxury to ask such questions is that the spread of the infection was contained by exceedingly stringent measures . 
Rapid and effective isolation of infected cases , together with efficient tracing and monitoring of the contacts made by those infected with SARS , allowed public health officials in Hong Kong , Toronto , Singapore , and Vietnam to contain the epidemic . 
Screening travelers from affected regions may have prevented significant epidemics elsewhere . 
Health officials around the world should maintain their vigilance and prepare for the possibility that renewed control efforts will be required if SARS resurges . 
Indeed , the experience with SARS in Toronto , where cases escaped detection and led to a second outbreak , stands as a warning against excessive optimism about the apparent control of the larger and more geographically dispersed outbreaks in Taiwan and mainland China . 
These epidemics may , in fact , be eliminated entirely in coming months . 
Like other respiratory infections , SARS may be easier to contract , more severe , or both , during winter . 
Continued surveillance and infection control measures will be required to ensure that the accomplishments of the last few months are not undone by a few undetected cases that touch off new SARS hot spots . 
Surveillance will not be easy . 
SARS is difficult to diagnose definitively , and during flu season , it will be much easier to miss a case of SARS . 
With current tests , it is impossible to verify that a patient has been infected with SARS until several weeks after symptoms begin . 
Experience around the world shows that SARS cases must be isolated within a few days of the onset of symptoms in order to control the spread of the virus . 
The dilemma is that playing it safe - by treating every flu-like illness with the precautions appropriate for SARS - would present an enormous logistical , operational and financial burden to health care systems . 
But to ignore the possibility that some such patients are SARS cases risks the start of new outbreaks . 
We don &apos;t have vaccines or rapid tests for SARS , but we do have them for flu . 
We need to use them . 
Influenza vaccine supplies should be increased so that more individuals are inoculated . 
Extra efforts should be made to encourage more people to get a flu shot , including those outside the traditional &quot; target &quot; groups , such as elderly people and health care workers . 
By preventing influenza , these vaccines reduce the number of individuals to be evaluated for SARS . 
Kits for rapid diagnosis of influenza infection already exist . 
If more physicians had routine access to these kits , they could tell on the spot whether a patient had influenza and eliminate the need to treat him or her as a possible SARS patient . 
Even assuming the best-case scenario - that SARS is eliminated by the end of this year - increased flu vaccination and better availability of diagnostics will benefit millions of people worldwide . 
According to the World Health Organization , as many as half a million people die each year from influenza . 
Many more are hospitalized with severe illness . 
Wider vaccination will protect people from infection and block the spread of the virus . 
Broader use of rapid diagnostics will permit more effective treatment for flu cases at risk of developing serious complications . 
If SARS is brought under control worldwide in the next few months , public health authorities will have achieved a great triumph . 
Successful containment of SARS might mark the first time in history that person-to-person , respiratory transmission of a major pathogen has been halted globally without the use of antibiotics or a vaccine . 
But we would be foolish to think we have seen the last of SARS , and it will take time for scientists to develop diagnostics , treatments , and vaccines . 
In the meantime , we should intensify the fight against an older nemesis , influenza , both for its own sake and as a way to prepare for the return of SARS .
