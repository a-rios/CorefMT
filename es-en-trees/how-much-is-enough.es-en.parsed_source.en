How Much is Enough ? 
LONDON - The economic downturn has produced an explosion of popular anger against bankers &quot; &quot; greed &quot; and their &quot; obscene &quot; bonuses . 
John Maynard Keynes addressed this issue in 1930 , in his little essay &quot; Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren . &quot; 
Keynes predicted that in 100 years - that is , by 2030 - growth in the developed world would , in effect , have stopped , because people would &quot; have enough &quot; to lead the &quot; good life . &quot; 
Hours of paid work would fall to three a day - a 15-hour week . 
Human beings would be more like the &quot; lilies of the field , who toil not , neither do they spin . &quot; 
Keynes &apos;s prediction rested on the assumption that , with a 2 % annual increase in capital , a 1 % increase in productivity , and a stable population , average standards of living would rise eight times on average . 
GDP per head in the United Kingdom in the late 1920 &quot; s ( before the 1929 crash ) was roughly £ 5,200 ( $ 8,700 ) in today &apos;s value . 
Accordingly , he estimated that a GDP per capita of roughly £ 40,000 ( $ 66,000 ) would be &quot; enough &quot; for humans to turn their attention to more agreeable things . 
It is not clear why Keynes thought eight times the average British national income per head would be &quot; enough . &quot; 
Most likely he took as his standard of sufficiency the bourgeois rentier income of his day , which was about ten times that of the average worker . 
Eighty years on , the developed world has approached Keynes &apos;s goal . 
In 2007 ( i.e. , pre-crash ) , the IMF reported that average GDP per head in the United States stood at $ 47,000 , and at $ 46,000 in the UK . 
In other words , the UK has had a five-fold increase in living standards since 1930 - despite the falsification of two of Keynes &apos;s assumptions : &quot; no major wars &quot; and &quot; no population growth &quot; ( in the UK , the population is 33 % higher than in 1930 ) . 
The reason we have done so well is that annual productivity growth has been higher than Keynes projected : about 1.6 % for the UK , and a bit higher for the US . 
Countries like Germany and Japan have done even better , despite the hugely disruptive effects of war . 
It is likely that Keynes &apos;s &quot; target &quot; of $ 66,000 will be achieved for most western countries by 2030 . 
But it is equally unlikely that this achievement will end the insatiable hunt for more money . Let &apos;s assume , cautiously , that we are two-thirds of the way towards Keynes &apos;s target . 
We might therefore have expected hours of work to have fallen by about two-thirds . 
In fact they have fallen by only one-third - and have stopped falling since the 1980 &quot; s . 
This makes it highly improbable that we will reach the three-hour working day by 2030 . 
It is also unlikely that growth will stop - unless nature itself calls a halt . 
People will continue to trade leisure for higher incomes . 
Keynes minimized the obstacles to his goal . 
He recognized that there are two kinds of needs , absolute and relative , and that the latter may be insatiable . 
As long as consumption is conspicuous and competitive , there will continue to be fresh reasons to work . 
Keynes did not entirely ignore the social character of work . 
&quot; It will remain reasonable , &quot; he wrote , &quot; to be economically purposive for others after it has ceased to be reasonable for oneself . &quot; 
The wealthy had a duty to help the poor . 
Keynes was probably not thinking of the developing world ( most of which had hardly started to develop in 1930 ) . 
Moreover , Keynes did not really confront the problem of what most people would do when they no longer needed to work . 
He writes : &quot; It is a fearful problem for the ordinary person , with no special talents , to occupy himself , especially if he no longer has roots in the soil or in custom or in the beloved conventions of a traditional economy . &quot; 
But , since most of the rich - &quot; those who have an independent income but no associations or duties or ties &quot; have &quot; failed disastrously &quot; to live the &quot; good life , &quot; why should those who are currently poor do any better ? 
Here I think Keynes comes closest to answering the question of why his &quot; enough &quot; will not , in fact , be enough . 
The accumulation of wealth , which should be a means to the &quot; good life , &quot; becomes an end in itself because it destroys many of the things that make life worth living . 
Beyond a certain point - which most of the world is still far from having reached - the accumulation of wealth offers only substitute pleasures for the real losses to human relations that it exacts . 
Finding the means to nourish the fading &quot; associations or duties or ties &quot; that are so essential for individuals to flourish is the unsolved problem of the developed world , and it is looming for the billions who have just stepped on to the growth ladder . 
George Orwell put it well : &quot; All progress is seen to be a frantic struggle towards an objective which you hope and pray will never be reached . &quot;
