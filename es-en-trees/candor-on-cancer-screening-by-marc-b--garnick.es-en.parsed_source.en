Candor on Cancer Screening 
BOSTON - One of today &apos;s most contentious medical debates centers on cancer screening , the benefits of which seem anything but debatable . 
Indeed , earlier detection , many believe , logically must give patients an advantage in fighting the disease . 
Prostate cancer is a case in point . 
Screening entails the mass testing of individuals of a certain age and gender , regardless of family history or personal health , to identify a potential disease state . 
For screening to be useful , the test or procedure must readily identify the disease in question , and the subsequent treatment must result in some measurable benefit . 
In other words , the screened population must be better off than the non-screened population . 
For some health issues - such as elevated cholesterol - screening yields positive results : a simple blood test measures the amounts of good and bad cholesterol in the blood , making it easier to detect related cardiovascular disease , which could lead to heart attacks or strokes . 
Those who are screened , diagnosed , and treated experience a lower rate of cardiovascular events . 
Screening for prostate cancer , too , requires a blood test - the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) test . 
Elevated PSA levels would suggest the presence of prostate cancer , even if no physical abnormalities were detected , so a tissue biopsy would be conducted . 
At this point , a diagnosis can be made . 
And , one hopes , the individual will be cured . 
Moreover , younger patients , at least , can better withstand the side effects of cancer treatment . 
Proponents also contend that the two-decade decline in the overall incidence of deaths from prostate cancer is the result of increasingly widespread PSA testing . 
Indeed , they encourage more vigorous screening programs . 
But screening &apos;s benefits are not as straightforward as supporters claim . 
To be sure , at-risk men - for example , those with a family history of prostate cancer , African-Americans , or men with enlarged prostates who are treated with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors ( whose failure to lower PSA levels could reflect increased risk of developing prostate cancer ) - may want to consider getting tested . 
For most healthy men , however , the United States Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) - a leading independent panel of experts on prevention and primary care - has publicly recommended against widespread PSA tests . 
Several well-managed , randomized , long-term human trials have shown almost no survival benefit for those who are screened , diagnosed , and treated , compared to those who were never screened . 
Of the studies cited by the USPSTF , one , conducted in Europe , showed a minor benefit in a subset of men , with no significant quality-of-life improvement . 
Another , conducted in the US , showed no evidence that PSA screening improved prostate-cancer survival rates . 
In addition , a recent study comparing outcomes for patients whose prostate gland was surgically removed to those for patients who underwent only observation found no differences in survival rates between the two groups . 
Because the average age at diagnosis is 71-73 , men are likely to die from other causes before prostate cancer claims their life . 
And there is no credible evidence that low-grade prostate cancer uniformly progresses to higher-grade cancers , so early treatment is not essential . 
Moreover , cancer treatment often carries serious side effects - including urinary incontinence , erectile dysfunction , and , in those who undergo radiation , inflammation of the lower rectum or bladder , as well as underreported effects like fecal incontinence - that can negatively affect patients &quot; quality of life . 
Given that many patients diagnosed with prostate cancer as a result of the PSA test would never suffer any symptoms , such consequences are difficult to justify . 
Yet many refuse to give up screening . 
Given this , an active surveillance program could be the best way to address the most serious consequence of excessive screening : premature , overly aggressive treatment . 
In an active surveillance program , a patient diagnosed with a PSA-prompted biopsy delays treatment . 
Instead , he is closely monitored with various follow-up tests . 
Only when signs indicate that the cancer is becoming dangerous is treatment initiated . 
While this approach is still being studied , the results so far appear promising : men who participate in active surveillance programs are 14 times more likely to die of a cause unrelated to prostate cancer . 
As evidence tilts the balance away from widespread PSA testing , a new screening test or biomarker is urgently needed that can distinguish effectively between potentially life-threatening prostate cancers and less dangerous forms . 
Likewise , less risky treatments are crucial . 
Active surveillance programs are an encouraging prospect for minimizing the negative consequences of PSA testing . 
But , without vastly improved screening practices , prostate cancer screening is unlikely to help - and can even do serious harm .
