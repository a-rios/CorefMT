Mexico is Burning 
MEXICO CITY - The last time Mexico experienced a political crisis more serious than the one it is undergoing today was in 1994 , when a group of so-called Zapatista guerrillas staged a semi-armed uprising in the southern state of Chiapas . 
The president &apos;s handpicked successor was assassinated , and , as if that was not enough , the value of the peso had plummeted by nearly 70 % . 
Today &apos;s crisis is not quite as bad , but it is getting close . 
In December 2012 , President Enrique Peña Nieto took office under inauspicious circumstances . 
He was elected with just 38 % of the vote , without a majority in either house of Congress , and with the opposition in control of Mexico City , the capital . 
The presidential runner-up , opposition leader Andrés Manuel López Obrador , questioned the results of the election . 
Peña Nieto faced serious challenges . 
His Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) had governed Mexico for 70 years , until it was swept out of power in 2000 . 
A large majority of Mexican voters continued to suspect it of corruption , authoritarianism , and economic incompetence . 
Peña Nieto &apos;s predecessor , Felipe Calderón , had bequeathed him a war on drugs that had already caused more than 60,000 deaths ; at least another 22,000 Mexicans were missing . 
At first , it looked like Peña Nieto would be able to turn things around . 
He cut a deal with both opposition parties - the center-right National Action Party ( PAN ) and the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) - and proceeded to win significant legislative changes . 
He was hailed as a world-class reformer . 
The country was living the &quot; Mexican Moment , &quot; as his handlers labeled it , and appeared to be on the verge of fulfilling , at long last , its great promise . 
Two years on , success seems to be slipping through Peña Nieto &apos;s hands . 
The country and its increasingly grey-haired president are experiencing one tragedy , scandal , or disappointment after another . 
The price of oil , from which the government obtains one-third of its revenue , has plunged 40 % in six months . 
With last year &apos;s economic growth expected to be 2 % , following just 1.1 % growth in 2013 , Mexico will barely have grown faster during the first third of Peña Nieto &apos;s six-year term than it did during the last quarter-century . 
Meanwhile , a pact Peña Nieto made with his predecessor is returning to haunt him . 
In exchange for support in the Senate for energy-sector reform , he gave Calderón and his aides a tacit blanket pardon for any conceivable misdeeds committed by Calderón &apos;s presidential administration . 
The massacre of 22 civilians by the army last June in Tlatlaya , a small town west of Mexico City , and the disappearance and subsequent murder and incineration of 43 students , also close to the capital , was not a new type of development in Mexico . 
Extrajudicial executions and disappearances were common under Calderón . 
But this time something snapped . 
Protests erupted across Mexico . 
The government mishandled both episodes , believing that they would blow over . 
Peña Nieto has yet to visit Iguala , the town where the students were abducted and murdered . 
He waited a month after they disappeared before meeting with their parents , and spent a week in China and Australia in the middle of the crisis . 
Meanwhile , charges of corruption have been piling up . 
Just hours after Peña Nieto canceled a contract with a Chinese railroad company to build a fast train north of Mexico City , it was revealed that his wife had acquired an ostentatious home - thanks to a mortgage extended to her by the Mexican partner of the Chinese railway firm . 
The conflict of interest was so brazen , even by Mexican standards , that the first lady - a popular former telenovela actress - quickly announced that she would sell the mansion . 
Then , in early December , the Wall Street Journal revealed that Peña Nieto &apos;s finance minister , Luis Videgaray , had also purchased a home in late 2012 , just before taking office , from the same contractor , with a similar mortgage . 
On the second anniversary of Peña Nieto &apos;s inauguration , his approval rating had dwindled to 39 % , with 58 % of the public disapproving of his performance . 
Peña Nieto has tried to soldier through the crisis by promising reforms aimed at improving security and strengthening the rule of law . 
The trouble with this strategy is what no Mexican president has been willing to acknowledge : the country has never experienced the rule of law . 
Before the advent of democracy in 2000 , order was imposed by the iron hand of a corrupt , authoritarian state . 
When its grip was loosened , any semblance of law and order disappeared . 
Unless and until this is recognized , reforms in this area will lack credibility for Mexicans and foreign investors alike , and thus are unlikely to be effective . 
Unfortunately , Peña Nieto , whose party ruled Mexico in the bad old days , is unlikely to be the president who breaks the mold . 
Mexico was once accustomed to crises ( even if it hasn &apos;t had one for 20 years ) ; but they typically erupted at the end of a presidential term . 
Peña Nieto has four more years in office , and he is constrained by the political elite that brought him to power from implementing the drastic measures - a cabinet reshuffle , criminal accountability for corruption and human-rights violations , and radical judicial reforms - that Mexico needs . 
But the alternative could be worse : a populist backlash that destroys much of what Mexico has achieved over the last two decades .
