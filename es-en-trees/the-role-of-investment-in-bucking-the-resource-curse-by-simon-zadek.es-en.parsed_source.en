One Flew Over the Resource Curse 
GENEVA - Geopolitical insight is often gained through real-life experience , rather than big-picture thinking . 
Arriving at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris from Conakry , Guinea , is a case in point : Conakry &apos;s airport , located in one of the world &apos;s poorest countries , outperforms France &apos;s prestigious global hub in terms of cleanliness , service , and pride . 
By amplifying such exemplars into a national project , Guinea could join the small group of commodity-rich countries that have bucked the curse of corruption and economic decay that often accompanies large natural-resource endowments . 
History demonstrates the difficulty of avoiding the so-called &quot; resource curse &quot; - and that it does not plague only less-developed countries like Nigeria , as many assume . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , the United Kingdom &apos;s North Sea-driven oil and gas boom undermined the country &apos;s broad-based economic competitiveness , while Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher &apos;s government wasted much of the revenue on handouts that encouraged excessive consumption . 
While a handful of commodity-rich countries have managed to buck the curse , including Botswana , Chile , and Norway , they have , nevertheless , failed to diversify their economies , remaining dependent on natural resource-based exports . 
But history is not destined to repeat itself , and leaders of commodity-rich countries are seeking alternative futures . 
Countries across Africa - including Ghana , Liberia , Mozambique , Rwanda , and Uganda - are showing early signs of success . 
Zambia recently issued a $ 750 million inaugural ten-year bond at an annual interest rate of 5.375 % . 
Oversubscribed by 24 times , the issue will allow Zambia to borrow more cheaply than many European countries can . 
Such developments reflect growing confidence in Africa &apos;s economic prospects and , thus , in its ability to escape the resource curse . 
But these countries still face significant obstacles to development . 
First , governments must balance long-term goals with short-term achievements . 
Given unlimited time , less-developed commodity-rich countries would first invest in human capital and institutions , then direct their growing commodity revenues into infrastructure , and move on to diversify their economies by strengthening the agriculture , manufacturing , and service sectors . 
In the real world , of course , such countries &quot; political economies demand short-term gains , beginning with basic services like potable water and electricity . 
If governments fail to respond to these basic demands , citizens take to the streets , often destructively . 
This summer in Guinea , for example , citizens &quot; frustration with widespread poverty and weak institutions , memories of ethnic persecution , and distrust of unfamiliar democratic processes fueled violent protests . 
Second , development requires both money and the right conditions . 
But , in many cases , the conditions placed on funding create barriers to investment . 
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank lead the chorus of traditional players eager to help , offering debt write-offs and concessionary finance . 
But the stringent institutional reforms that they demand , while beneficial in theory , might not stabilize , let alone enhance , the development process . 
Newcomers , most notably China , have become a ready alternative source of cheap finance . 
But , in exchange , the Chinese expect business opportunities and , to some extent , political influence . 
Sovereign-wealth funds , too , are increasingly involved in financing development . 
But , despite being state-owned and subject to policy decisions , they function as commercial enterprises ( with the possible exception of Norway &apos;s hydrocarbon-funded state-owned investment vehicles ) . 
Financing for the most expensive projects - implementing green-energy systems , building transport infrastructure , and developing modern cities - must come from foreign institutional investors . 
But high-quality private investors are resistant to financing lumpy , illiquid investments in fragile , volatile states . 
Those who are willing to engage often demand steep risk premiums that dramatically increase the cost of capital , often to usurious levels . 
Global mining companies like Rio Tinto are increasingly working alongside emerging-economy leaders like China &apos;s Chalco to support development . 
As the most heavily invested , they have the most experience using cheap debt to create value . 
But , with commodity prices beginning to drop , even the most bullish companies are reassessing ambitious investment plans - a trend reflected in the Brazilian mining giant Vale &apos;s recent decision to put its investment in Guinea on hold . 
Bucking the resource curse requires , first and foremost , strong , legitimate domestic political leadership , underpinned by effective institutional arrangements . 
But it also requires a global investment community - public , private , and mixed - that can move beyond short-term thinking , ideological bias , ignorance , and cynicism . 
After all , bets on leadership , vision , and earnings potential should not be limited to investments in California-based technology start-ups . 
Guinea , which is making progress despite annual per capita income of roughly $ 450 , exemplifies the potential of the world &apos;s poorest countries to surpass expectations . 
Investors should take note .
