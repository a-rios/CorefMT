The Global Future of Europe &apos;s Crisis 
WASHINGTON , DC - It is now clear that the eurozone crisis will continue well into 2012 , despite early February &apos;s recovery in stock markets . 
Negotiations between Greece and the banks over Greek sovereign debt may yet be concluded , but sufficiently wide participation by banks in the deal remains very much in doubt . 
Meanwhile , the International Monetary Fund has raised the issue of official-sector debt reduction , possibly even by the European Central Bank , sending the message that a &quot; haircut &quot; for private bondholders will not be enough to return Greece to financial sustainability . 
The IMF &apos;s concerns are valid , but the Fund &apos;s idea is being resisted fiercely , owing to fears of political contagion : other debt-distressed eurozone countries might press for equal treatment . 
Moreover , the promised increase in IMF resources that would allow it to build a stronger firewall against financial contagion has still not arrived . 
And all of the changes agreed upon for the European Stabilization Fund ( ESF ) and the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) have yet to be implemented . 
Of course , some positive steps have been taken . 
The ECB &apos;s generous provision of liquidity to European banks at only 1 % interest for up to three years has prevented a banking crisis from piling on top of the sovereign-debt crisis . 
But that initiative has not succeeded in reducing the &quot; problem &quot; countries &quot; longer-term borrowing costs to levels compatible with their projected growth rates : there is just too much long-term uncertainty , and growth prospects are simply too discouraging . 
Indeed , in mid-January Standard 
Poor &apos;s downgraded AAA-rated France and Austria , in addition to seven other eurozone countries - Slovenia , Slovakia , Spain , Malta , Italy , Cyprus , and Portugal . 
It now seems clear to almost everyone that one key challenge facing the eurozone stems from the fact that it is a monetary union without being an economic union , an arrangement that has no counterpart anywhere . 
As a result , divergences in production costs over time cannot be compensated by exchange-rate adjustments . 
In the absence of somewhat higher inflation in the surplus countries , say , 4 % a year , adjustment requires deflation in the crisis countries to bring about a noticeable relative decline in production costs over time . 
In practice , such deflation can be achieved only at the cost of high unemployment and social distress . 
It is therefore unclear whether the current strategy of combining austerity and deflation is politically feasible , which explains the huge uncertainty hanging over the entire eurozone . 
Somewhat higher inflation in the surplus countries and larger cross-border resource transfers would give the deficit countries more time , allowing for structural reforms to produce results and reducing the need for deflation . 
But Northern European surplus countries reject such an approach , fearing that it would weaken the pressure on Southern European debtor countries to undertake structural reforms in the first place . 
Beyond the specific problems of the monetary union , there is also a global dimension to Europe &apos;s challenges - the tension , emphasized by authors such as Dani Rodrik , and Jean Michel Severino and Olivier Ray , between national democratic politics and globalization . 
Trade , communication , and financial linkages have created a degree of interdependence among national economies , which , together with heightened vulnerability to financial-market swings , has restricted national policymakers &quot; freedom of action everywhere . 
Perhaps the most dramatic sign of this tension came when Greece &apos;s then-prime minister , George Papandreou , announced a referendum on the policy package proposed to allow Greece to stay in the eurozone . 
While one can debate the merits of referenda for decision-making , the heart of the problem was the very notion of holding a national debate for several weeks , given that markets move in hours or minutes . 
It took less than 24 hours for Papandreou &apos;s proposal to collapse under the pressure of financial markets ( and European leaders &quot; fear of them ) . 
Around the world , the stock of financial assets has become so large , relative to national income flows , that financial-market movements can overwhelm most countries . 
Even the largest economies are vulnerable , particularly if they are highly dependent on debt finance . 
If , for some reason , financial markets and / or China &apos;s central bank were suddenly to reject US Treasury bonds , interest rates would soar , sending the American economy into recession . 
But being a creditor does not provide strong protection , either . 
If Americans &quot; appetite for Chinese exports suddenly collapsed because of a financial panic in the United States , China would find itself in serious economic trouble . 
These interlinked threats are real , and they require much stronger global economic-policy cooperation . 
Citizens , however , want to understand what is going on , debate policies , and give their consent to the types of cooperation proposed . 
Thus , a more supra-national form of politics is needed to re-embed markets in democratic processes , as happened during the course of the twentieth century with national politics and national markets . 
The scale of this challenge becomes apparent when one sees how difficult it is to coordinate economic policies even in the European Union , which has moved much further than any other group of countries in the direction of supra-national cooperation . 
Nonetheless , unless globalization can be slowed down or partly reversed , which is unlikely and undesirable in the long run , the kind of &quot; politics beyond borders &quot; for which Europe is groping will become a global necessity . 
Indeed , the European crisis may be providing a mere foretaste of what will likely be the central political debate of the first half of the twenty-first century : how to resolve the tension between global markets and national politics .
