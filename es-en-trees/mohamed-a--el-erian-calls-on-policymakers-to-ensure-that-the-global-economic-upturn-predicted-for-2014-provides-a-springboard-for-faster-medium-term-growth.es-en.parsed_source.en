Achieving Escape Velocity 
NEWPORT BEACH - It is not often that one can confidently claim that a single remedy could make billions of people around the world significantly better off ; do so in a durable and mutually supportive manner ; and thus improve the well-being of both current and future generations . 
Yet that is the case today . 
The remedy I have in mind , of course , is faster economic growth - the one thing that can raise living standards , reduce excessive inequalities , improve job prospects , alleviate trade tensions , and even moderate geopolitical pressures . 
And most forecasters - including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - are now predicting that global growth will pick up in 2014 , and that it will be more balanced among the world &apos;s major economic regions . 
Such forecasts reflect three welcome developments . 
For starters , Europe will exit recession , with the peripheral economies benefiting from the strongest relative improvement in growth prospects . 
Meanwhile , 3 % annual GDP growth is no longer out of reach for the United States . 
And emerging economies will be anchored by China &apos;s slower but still-robust 7 % annual growth . 
But , while the prospect of faster global growth is indeed good news , especially given still-high unemployment in many countries and the associated pressures on social safety nets , it is too early to celebrate . 
There is a risk that , by tempting policy complacency , this year &apos;s economic upturn could end up being counterproductive . 
This is not because the predicted acceleration in growth is still quite modest . 
After all , even a limited uptick can make a significant difference if it is part of an encouraging medium-term growth dynamic . 
Rather , the risk lies in the manner in which this growth is likely to materialize - namely , by depending too much on old and exhausted growth models , rather than by comprehensively embracing new ones . 
In Europe , growth this year will largely reflect the impact of financial stabilization , not deep structural reforms . 
With interest-rate spreads having compressed sharply , and with the threat of a meltdown averted , both domestic and foreign investors continue to return to peripheral economies , thereby alleviating severe credit rationing . 
That is certainly good news , especially if the source of stabilization is shifted from the European Central Bank &apos;s unconventional policies to more durable endogenous balance-sheet healing among a broader set of financial institutions , non-financial firms , and households . 
But few of these economies are prepared to embark on the type of internal reforms that promise sustained high growth rates and a substantial reduction in unemployment , which has been at alarming levels for young people and in terms of duration . 
Meanwhile , exchange-rate appreciation is beginning to undermine exports in the eurozone &apos;s core countries , particularly Germany , which has been the regional growth engine in recent years . 
The predicted acceleration in US growth this year is more notable , because it reflects the positive impact of a multi-year process of economic and financial healing . 
We are also starting to see the macro-level impact of certain productivity revolutions - particularly in the energy and technology sectors - that , so far , have mainly been industrial and sectoral phenomena . 
Yet America &apos;s actual economic growth in 2014 will remain well below potential . 
Moreover , the US economy &apos;s performance remains overly dependent on the Federal Reserve &apos;s experimental monetary policies , courageously adopted in the absence of adequate measures by other economic policymakers . 
The US economy is certainly capable of reaching the &quot; escape velocity &quot; that the country needs if unemployment is to fall in a more definitive and lasting manner . 
But this requires Congress to support President Barack Obama &apos;s administration in three areas : improving the composition and level of aggregate demand ; enhancing the economy &apos;s supply responsiveness ; and removing residual debt overhangs that continue to inhibit economic activity . 
Only decisive progress on these fronts will unlock the trillions of corporate dollars that , rather than being invested in new plants and equipment , remain stranded on companies &quot; balance sheets or are handed over to shareholders via higher dividends and share buybacks . 
The issues in the emerging world are more complex and diverse . 
Some countries are making consistent efforts to revamp exhausted growth models . 
In China , for example , this involves less reliance on exports and public investment , and more on the private components of domestic aggregate demand . 
Other countries , however , have responded to their growth slowdown in 2012 and 2013 by reverting to old practices that offer the temptation of immediate expansion at the cost of growth-dampening outcomes down the road . 
This is the case , for example , in Brazil and Turkey . 
All of this implies that the emerging world as a whole is unlikely in 2014 to resume its role as a major engine of the global economy , and that the quality of what growth there is will be far from optimal . 
Indeed , the more detailed one &apos;s analysis of today &apos;s global growth dynamics is , the more likely one is to conclude that this year &apos;s brighter prospects are just that - brighter prospects for 2014 . 
There is still much that can ( and should ) be done if this year &apos;s predicted upturn is to provide a springboard for a meaningful medium-term growth spurt that improves prospects for current and future generations . 
Unless policymakers keep in mind the larger tasks at hand , they risk falling into a trap of comfortable underachievement .
