Getting to Yes ( Again ) with Germany 
GENEVA - Europe &apos;s slow-motion sovereign-debt crisis may appear unique , but it is not . 
Just a few decades ago , Europe had the Exchange Rate Mechanism , which collapsed during a crisis very much akin to the one afflicting Europe today . 
Will the outcome this time be different ? 
The ERM was an arrangement that pegged most European currencies &quot; exchange-rate movements within limited bands . 
But ERM members &quot; monetary policies remained home-grown , which , no surprise , occasionally led to fiscal imbalances . 
When capital markets smelled a problem among ERM members , they invariably shorted the most vulnerable currency and pushed that country &apos;s authorities to devalue . 
Authorities resisted , blamed speculators , and then , usually over a frantic few days , gave in . 
Markets also tested the resolve of policymakers in otherwise sound ERM countries , particularly when there were big strikes or important elections . 
In those cases , even a government with the proper economic fundamentals and its financial house in order could still run into trouble . 
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet is well aware of this : in the early 1990 &quot; s , he confronted such a crisis as Governor of the Bank of France . 
Some contemporary observers of the ERM thought that there was an easy fix for these troubles . 
If the central bank of the country that printed its &quot; strong currency &quot; ( Germany ) had been willing to provide unlimited support to a &quot; weak currency , &quot; things would have been sorted out . 
Germany &apos;s Bundesbank , it was suggested , would stand ready to buy &quot; unlimited quantities &quot; of lire or francs , so no one would dare to short either currency . 
The notion of &quot; unlimited quantities &quot; was important : speculators would force officials to exhaust limited quantities , with the purchasing authority ( the Bundesbank ) eventually bearing the loss . 
Monetary support would lead to fiscal transfers , making limited interventions a non-starter . 
With unlimited support , by contrast , every single speculator could be quashed , and no loss would be borne ( since intervention to support a weak currency would succeed ) . 
The only problem was that both the Bundesbank and the German government always fiercely resisted such an arrangement , on the grounds that it could lead to the printing of unlimited quantities of Deutschmarks , and thus stoke inflation . 
Instead , Europe developed the euro , which solved the problem of speculative attacks and monetary credibility by replacing individual currencies with a new one . 
It was impossible to short the lira or the franc because there were no more lire or francs . 
But Italy and France had to give something in return for this security : the ECB was made independent of all eurozone governments . 
Yet the current debt crisis has resurrected the old problem , with debt now filling the role that currencies played under the ERM . 
Some eurozone countries borrowed excessively and have been punished by the markets , perhaps deservedly so , while others , in the resulting climate of anxiety , have become targets for speculators . 
On July 21 , eurozone leaders agreed to make &quot; more extensive &quot; use of the new European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) by permitting it to purchase endangered eurozone countries &quot; debt in secondary markets . 
But the EFSF &apos;s &quot; more extensive interventions &quot; recalls the &quot; unlimited quantities &quot; of foreign-exchange intervention proposed to rescue the ERM . 
If &quot; more extensive &quot; means piecemeal limited commitments that will eventually be exhausted , the scheme runs the risk of creating losses ( just as the Bundesbank would have suffered losses had it engaged in limited defense of weak ERM currencies ) . 
To rule this out , &quot; unlimited interventions &quot; would be needed . 
But with whose resources , and under whose authority ? 
This explains the growing excitement about issuing &quot; Eurobonds . &quot; 
The conversion of all eurozone national bonds into obligations jointly recognized by all eurozone governments is a replica of the solution to the ERM &apos;s breakdown , which consisted in abandoning national currencies in favor of the euro . 
This would cost Germany control over the quality of its credit , just as the replacement of the Bundesbank by the ECB implied Germany &apos;s loss of control over the quality of its currency ( though it was given a large role in designing the ECB ) . 
What is missing in today &apos;s proposals is the equivalent of the ECB &apos;s independence , which ensured Germany &apos;s participation in the euro . 
It is no coincidence that one of the leading opponents - the ECB &apos;s first chief economist , Otmar Issing - of the &quot; unlimited interventions &quot; policy under the ERM recently rebuked both the &quot; extended-EFSF &quot; and Eurobonds . 
The current proposals , Issing argues , are &quot; undemocratic . &quot; 
The concessions needed to ensure German participation are likely to be enormous . 
With markets &quot; ability to monitor dubious borrowers , the guarantees will probably have to be institutional , constitutional , and political - probably formal control over European fiscal policy by a body at least as credible as the ECB , which would mean a dramatic reduction in the power of national parliaments . 
Such radical changes would require the consent of all eurozone countries . 
And the Bundestag ( not Standard and Poor &apos;s ) would have to be happy . 
Anything short of this is bound to fail .
