UNESCO for Sale 
COLUMBUS , OHIO - In a better world , my nieces and nephews in Equatorial Guinea would respect our country &apos;s president for overseeing the careful management of revenues pouring in from oil , and for using these funds for development . 
In a better world , my nieces and nephews would honor the United Nations &quot; main cultural institution , UNESCO , for insisting on improving the education and health of Africa &apos;s children . 
But in the world as we know it , relatively few people love and respect President Teodoro Obiang . 
His biggest fans might include the high-living members of his family , along with selected business executives in the United States and Europe , where he spends quite a bit of his money . 
They have accepted $ 3 million from him for a prize named in his honor . 
The prize is supposed to recognize the work of individuals and institutions , including non-governmental organizations , for scientific research in the life sciences that improves the quality of human life . 
Perhaps the recipients will love Obiang , too . 
It is easy to see where Obiang - who seized power in Equatorial Guinea after killing his predecessor - gets the money that he tosses around . 
Since the mid-1990 &quot; s , Equatorial Guinea has become a large oil exporter . 
While Obiang and his family and cronies jet around the world living the high life , my nieces and nephews number among the vast majority of the country &apos;s people who remain mired in poverty . 
Child mortality is high . 
Free and fair elections do not exist . 
Arbitrary detention and torture are widespread . 
The government allows almost no independent news and information . 
In 2009 , the UN found that Equatorial Guinea had the world &apos;s largest disparity between its per capita GDP ranking , which was on a par with Italy and Spain , and its level of human development - close to Haiti &apos;s . 
My nieces and nephews have a life expectancy of 52 years . 
According to the president &apos;s son and heir-apparent , Teodorin Obiang , in Equatorial Guinea it is not illegal for a government minister to own a company and to submit bids for government contracts to the ministry that he or she controls . 
Such brazen corruption would be laughable if its effects were not so debilitating to the country . 
Among its avowed priorities , UNESCO lists gender equality , universal education , sustainable development , and ethics . 
My nieces and nephews in Equatorial Guinea still go to school on an empty stomach . 
They return home by mid-day to help supplement the household income by selling doughnuts in the streets - at a time when they are supposed to be completing homework . 
Surviving on less than a dollar a day , as most of my countrymen do , means living without running water , sanitation , or electricity . 
Given the mountain of evidence of corruption and money-laundering by Obiang , his family , and his associates , as well as the deplorable living conditions that people in Equatorial Guinea endure , how is it possible that UNESCO agreed to accept Obiang &apos;s money and name a prize in life sciences after him ? 
What due diligence was conducted to ensure that the money it received to fund the prize was not actually stolen from the very Africans whose interests UNESCO claims to champion ? 
As far as the people of Equatorial Guinea are concerned , by offering this prize , UNESCO lends credibility to Obiang and his regime , and becomes complicit in its abuses . 
UNESCO - not alone among UN entities - seems more inclined to bend over backwards to avoid taking any action that might offend &quot; African sensibilities &quot; on its board . 
One European ambassador was quoted as saying that African countries were all in favor of the prize , and they had enough supporters to take it forward . 
The Obiang Prize is a mockery of everything UNESCO publicly stands for . 
UNESCO remains unabashed . 
It has signaled no willingness to withdraw the award or investigate the origins of Obiang &apos;s gift . 
Wouldn &apos;t it be nice if UNESCO and its executive board - particularly the board &apos;s African members - actually stood up for African people ? 
Or maybe they love Obiang &apos;s money more than they love my nieces and nephews .
