Guatemala \ u0027s Candidate from Hell 
The indictment describes brutal crimes - mass murders , rapes , and the dislocation of hundreds of thousands of people - carried out systematically in the Guatemalan highlands . 
In San Martín Jilotepeque , villagers were rounded up by Guatemala &apos;s military , forced to cook for soldiers and dig pits in the earth . 
Later , their masters shot and then dumped them into the pits . 
In Santa María Nebaj , children were shot or beaten to death before being thrown into a ravine that also served as an open-air outhouse . 
After the massacre , soldiers burned the bodies and the houses of their victims . 
The man that Guatemalan human rights organizations charge with responsibility for these acts is Efraín Ríos Montt , ruler of Guatemala during the &quot; scorched earth &quot; campaign of the early 1980 &apos;s . 
Given the gravity of the accusations , and the abundance of evidence against him , Ríos Montt should be on his way to prison . 
Instead , he could be headed to the presidency . 
Against great odds - and the wording of Guatemala &apos;s Constitution - the former brigadier general and dictator has qualified for the ballot in Guatemala &apos;s presidential election , set for November 9 . 
Ríos Montt &apos;s presence on the ballot has shocked Guatemalans committed to combating the impunity the country &apos;s powerful have traditionally enjoyed . 
Claudia Samayoa , a Guatemalan political analyst , calls it &quot; a blow against the victims , and against all those who have struggled in Guatemala for human rights and democracy . &quot; 
His election would have enormous implications , symbolizing the triumph of impunity over accountability . 
It would indicate that there can be no true peace in Guatemala as long as the powerful are accommodated with grants of amnesty and forgetting is prized over truth and justice . 
As for a bit of history- following Guatemala &apos;s transition from military rule to electoral democracy , Ríos Montt made several attempts in the 1990 &apos;s to run for president . 
He was barred from the ballot by a provision in the 1985 Guatemalan constitution that prohibited people who had participated in military coups from serving as head of state . 
Rebuffed but undaunted , Ríos Montt founded a political party , the Guatemalan Republican Front ( FRG ) . 
His deputy , Alfonso Portillo , won the presidency in 1999 . 
Ríos Montt earned a seat in Guatemala &apos;s Congress , and went on to rule both the party and the legislature . 
All of this occurred at the very moment a UN supported truth commission was concluding that the violence conducted under Ríos Montt &apos;s rule constituted genocide against the Mayan people of Guatemala . 
Ríos Montt &apos;s latest political battle began when he sought to contest the upcoming presidential election . 
His petition was first denied by the Guatemalan electoral authority and then by the Supreme Court . 
In July , however , the Constitutional Court - staffed by several justices appointed by Ríos Montt - ruled in favor of permitting him to participate in the election . 
Whether Ríos Montt can win is a topic of intense debate . 
Polls show him trailing Oscar Berger , a conservative former Guatemala City mayor supported by the business community , as well as the more leftist candidate , Alvaro Colom . 
It is difficult to gauge Ríos Montt &apos;s actual popularity . 
Guatemala &apos;s press has taken a hostile position against the former general . 
In July , amidst the turmoil surrounding the judicial flip-flopping on his candidacy , busloads of his followers - including paramilitaries armed with machetes and guns - entered the capital and attacked groups of people critical of the general . 
One journalist , Hector Ramirez , died of a heart attack while fleeing from the mob ; others narrowly escaped lynching . 
Meanwhile , all over Guatemala , thousands of communities are seeking to exhume the graves of the massacred . 
Evidence produced in these exhumations is being organized into indictments , prepared by the non-governmental Center for Human Rights and Legal Action ( CALDH ) . 
The genocide charges against Ríos Montt are being pursued in Guatemala &apos;s courts . 
If the courts fail to act , the CALDH will take the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in San Jose , Costa Rica , or perhaps to Europe . 
Human rights activists have increasingly sought friendly foreign courts , willing to invoke universal jurisdiction over so-called crimes &quot; of international concern . &quot; 
If Ríos Montt faces trial instead of another reign as ruler , perhaps Guatemalans - and the wider world - will begin to see the power of the truth . 
Otherwise , we will once again see only the truth about power . 
Sadly , at this moment Guatemala invokes the bitter wisdom of William Faulkner , who once observed that &quot; the past isn &apos;t dead - it isn &apos;t even over yet . &quot;
