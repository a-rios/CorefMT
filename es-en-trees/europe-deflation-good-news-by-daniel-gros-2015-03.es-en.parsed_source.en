Why Deflation is Good News for Europe 
BRUSSELS - In today &apos;s global economy , there is no price as important as that of crude oil . 
More than 80 million barrels are produced ( and consumed ) daily , and a large part of that output is traded internationally . 
Thus , the sharp fall in the crude-oil price - from about $ 110 last year to around $ 60 today - is yielding hundreds of billions of dollars in savings for oil importers . 
For Europe , the benefits of cheap oil might grow over time , because long-term gas-supply contracts are to a significant degree indexed to the oil price . 
This represents another advantage for Europe , where prices for natural gas were , until recently , several times higher than in the US , which had been benefiting from lower-cost shale energy . 
But many observers have argued that cheap oil also has a downside , because it exacerbates deflationary tendencies in the advanced countries , which already seem to be mired in a low-growth trap . 
The sharp fall in oil prices , according to this view , will make it even harder for these countries &apos; central banks to achieve the 2 % annual inflation rate that most have targeted in fulfilling their price-stability mandate . 
The eurozone , in particular , seems to be in danger , as prices are now falling for the first time since 2009 . 
This deflation is bad , it is argued , because it makes it harder for debtors , especially in the troubled economies of the eurozone &apos;s periphery ( Greece , Ireland , Italy , Portugal , and Spain ) , to pay what they owe . 
But this fear is unfounded , because it is based on a misunderstanding . 
What matters for debt-service capacity is the debtors &apos; income , not the general price level . 
As oil prices fall , households &apos; real ( inflation-adjusted ) income should rise , because they do not have to spend as much on fuel and heating . 
Lower oil prices make life easier , not harder , for highly indebted households in the US or the eurozone periphery . 
Most manufacturing enterprises will also benefit from lower energy costs , improving their ability to service their debts . 
This , too , is particularly relevant in the eurozone periphery , where the non-financial sector accumulated too much debt during the credit boom that preceded the 2008 global financial crisis . 
Moreover , though most of the savings implied by lower energy costs might initially show up in higher profits , over time , competition will force companies to pass on some of these windfall gains in the form of lower prices or higher wages . 
This is another important consequence of cheap oil : lower prices make it more difficult to judge the point at which wage pressure becomes inflationary . 
Because wages can increase to a greater extent without fueling inflation , the US Federal Reserve Board might be inclined to delay hiking interest rates , which it is now widely expected to do this summer . 
Public finances should also benefit from the deflation engendered by lower oil prices . 
Government revenues depend on the value of domestic output , not only consumption . 
Though lower oil prices depress consumer prices , they should boost production and overall GDP . 
Absent large price changes for raw materials , the consumer price index evolves along with the GDP deflator ( the price deflator for the entire economy ) . 
This should lead to solid government revenues , which is good news for highly indebted governments throughout the industrialized world , but particularly for the eurozone periphery . 
The fall in ( consumer ) prices that the eurozone currently is experiencing should thus be seen as a positive development for all energy importers . The eurozone periphery , in particular , can look forward to an ideal combination of low interest rates , a favorable euro exchange rate , and a boost in real incomes as a result of cheap oil . 
In a deflationary environment , lower oil prices appear to make it more difficult for the European Central Bank to achieve its target of an inflation rate close to 2 % . 
In reality , lower oil prices represent a boon for Europe - especially for its most beleaguered nations .
