Crony Central Banking in Hong Kong 
HONG KONG - Joseph Yam , the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ( HKMA ) and a career civil servant , is retiring . 
Ordinarily , that should not be a newsworthy event , yet it is , and for good reasons . 
Donald Tsang , Chief Executive of Hong Kong &apos;s government , has the opportunity to restore integrity and proper governance in one of the most important statutory bodies in the territory by choosing a person solely on the basis of unimpeachable honesty and competence . 
Yam remains a hero to many in Hong Kong , including journalists unschooled in international finance . 
To them , he is the guardian of the Hong Kong dollar , which has been fixed at 7.8 to the US dollar for 26 years . 
During the 1998 financial crisis , devaluation would have hurt those who owned local real estate but had little earnings or assets in US dollars . 
The 7.8 exchange rate was maintained at the cost - borne by all citizens - of six years of economic stagnation . 
The currency was in theory governed by a rules-based Currency Board , which the British invented for their smaller colonies . 
It tied the local currency to the British Pound , giving local authorities no discretion in monetary policy . 
While imperial in origin , the rationale behind the Currency Board was sound . 
Colonies were short on expertise . 
Freedom in money creation or in interest-rate policy could mean economic disaster - as , indeed , it did in many ex-colonies following independence . 
Yam was always frustrated by the lack of policy freedom under the Currency Board . 
Before the crisis struck in 1998 he put in place measures giving him room to manipulate liquidity and interest rates . 
His deviation from the system also created loopholes that he did not know about or thought irrelevant . 
This was precisely what the British empire-builders had wanted to prevent . 
When , during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis , global investment professionals turned their attention from Thailand and Korea to Hong Kong , they quickly spotted structural weaknesses in the way the currency was managed . 
Local experts had previously warned Yam about this , but he dismissed their argument in a way that one economist who was present at a meeting with him described as &quot; demeaning and contemptuous . &quot; Moreover , they left in shock in realizing Yam , and the financial secretary , Donald Tsang , nominally his boss but without real power , didn &apos;t really understand the experts &quot; economic reasoning . 
Hong Kong &quot; s government , led by the HKMA , launched an unprecedented intervention , buying up local shares to &quot; defeat &quot; the speculators , but failed to stop the stampede by global investors , including conservative pension and mutual funds . 
Finally , with the government about to exhaust its entire foreign reserves , Yam realized that he had to change course . 
He wisely accepted his critics &quot; suggestions , fixing the problems that he had denied existed . 
He was awarded the highest public-service medal by the then Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chi-wah , who was later ousted by Beijing for incompetence . 
At this writing , Yam is widely criticized in Hong Kong for failing to protect small investors against the dishonest sales tactics of a number of banks in their selling of toxic Lehman Brothers derivatives disguised as bonds . 
He denies any responsibility , even though the HKMA oversees all financial institutions . 
Yam is the highest-paid civil servant in the world , earning US $ 1.5 million last year . 
He claims that he should be rewarded as a fund manager supervising a multibillion-dollar fund in the private sector . 
The HKMA &apos;s Compensation Committee had the sole responsibility for setting Yam &apos;s salary . 
The Committee routinely rubber-stamped his salary demands . 
Yam &apos;s retirement presents an opportunity for Hong Kong &apos;s government to redress a major issue of governance . 
It should replace the compensation structure by the same civil-service scale applied to the government of which the HKMA is an integral part . 
Hong Kong &quot; s civil servants are already the best paid in the world . 
Anyone seeking to compare a public-service job with the private sector in negotiating an employment contract should simply seek work in the private sector rather than for the public good . 
Anything else merely opens the door for corruption . 
There is much speculation that Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang is about to appoint a generalist civil servant better known for his personal loyalty than for his financial expertise . 
Nor is there any sign that the entire HKMA pay scale should be scrapped . 
Either outcome would mean that the Chief Executive has missed an opportunity to send the right signal that Hong Kong stands for good public governance rather than cronyism .
