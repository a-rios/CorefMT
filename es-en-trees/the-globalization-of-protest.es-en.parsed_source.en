The Globalization of Protest 
NEW YORK - The protest movement that began in Tunisia in January , subsequently spreading to Egypt , and then to Spain , has now become global , with the protests engulfing Wall Street and cities across America . 
Globalization and modern technology now enables social movements to transcend borders as rapidly as ideas can . 
And social protest has found fertile ground everywhere : a sense that the &quot; system &quot; has failed , and the conviction that even in a democracy , the electoral process will not set things right - at least not without strong pressure from the street . 
In May , I went to the site of the Tunisian protests ; in July , I talked to Spain &apos;s indignados ; from there , I went to meet the young Egyptian revolutionaries in Cairo &apos;s Tahrir Square ; and , a few weeks ago , I talked with Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York . 
There is a common theme , expressed by the OWS movement in a simple phrase : &quot; We are the 99 % . &quot; 
That slogan echoes the title of an article that I recently published , entitled &quot; Of the 1 % , for the 1 % , and by the 1 % , &quot; describing the enormous increase in inequality in the United States : 1 % of the population controls more than 40 % of the wealth and receives more than 20 % of the income . 
And those in this rarefied stratum often are rewarded so richly not because they have contributed more to society - bonuses and bailouts neatly gutted that justification for inequality - but because they are , to put it bluntly , successful ( and sometimes corrupt ) rent-seekers . 
This is not to deny that some of the 1 % have contributed a great deal . 
Indeed , the social benefits of many real innovations ( as opposed to the novel financial &quot; products &quot; that ended up unleashing havoc on the world economy ) typically far exceed what their innovators receive . 
But , around the world , political influence and anti-competitive practices ( often sustained through politics ) have been central to the increase in economic inequality . 
And tax systems in which a billionaire like Warren Buffett pays less tax ( as a percentage of his income ) than his secretary , or in which speculators , who helped to bring down the global economy , are taxed at lower rates than those who work for their income , have reinforced the trend . 
Research in recent years has shown how important and ingrained notions of fairness are . 
Spain &apos;s protesters , and those in other countries , are right to be indignant : here is a system in which the bankers got bailed out , while those whom they preyed upon have been left to fend for themselves . 
Worse , the bankers are now back at their desks , earning bonuses that amount to more than most workers hope to earn in a lifetime , while young people who studied hard and played by the rules see no prospects for fulfilling employment . 
The rise in inequality is the product of a vicious spiral : the rich rent-seekers use their wealth to shape legislation in order to protect and increase their wealth - and their influence . 
The US Supreme Court , in its notorious Citizens United decision , has given corporations free rein to use their money to influence the direction of politics . 
But , while the wealthy can use their money to amplify their views , back on the street , police wouldn &apos;t allow me to address the OWS protesters through a megaphone . 
The contrast between overregulated democracy and unregulated bankers did not go unnoticed . 
But the protesters are ingenious : they echoed what I said through the crowd , so that all could hear . 
They are right that something is wrong about our &quot; system . &quot; 
Around the world , we have underutilized resources - people who want to work , machines that lie idle , buildings that are empty - and huge unmet needs : fighting poverty , promoting development , and retrofitting the economy for global warming , to name just a few . 
In America , after more than seven million home foreclosures in recent years , we have empty homes and homeless people . 
The protesters have been criticized for not having an agenda . 
But this misses the point of protest movements . 
They are an expression of frustration with the electoral process . 
They are an alarm . 
The anti-globalization protests in Seattle in 1999 , at what was supposed to be the inauguration of a new round of trade talks , called attention to the failures of globalization and the international institutions and agreements that govern it . 
When the press looked into the protesters &quot; allegations , they found that there was more than a grain of truth in them . 
The trade negotiations that followed were different - at least in principle , they were supposed to be a development round , to make up for some of the deficiencies highlighted by protesters - and the International Monetary Fund subsequently undertook significant reforms . 
So , too , in the US , the civil-rights protesters of the 1960 &quot; s called attention to pervasive institutionalized racism in American society . 
That legacy has not yet been overcome , but the election of President Barack Obama shows how far those protests moved America . 
On one level , today &apos;s protesters are asking for little : a chance to use their skills , the right to decent work at decent pay , a fairer economy and society . 
Their hope is evolutionary , not revolutionary . 
But , on another level , they are asking for a great deal : a democracy where people , not dollars , matter , and a market economy that delivers on what it is supposed to do . 
The two are related : as we have seen , unfettered markets lead to economic and political crises . 
Markets work the way they should only when they operate within a framework of appropriate government regulations ; and that framework can be erected only in a democracy that reflects the general interest - not the interests of the 1 % . 
The best government that money can buy is no longer good enough .
