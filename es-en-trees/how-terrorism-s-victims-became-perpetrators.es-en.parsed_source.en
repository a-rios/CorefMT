How Terrorism \ u0027s Victims Became Perpetrators 
Why is America in trouble ? 
September 11 was a traumatic event that shook the nation to its core . 
Declaring war on terrorism was understandable , perhaps even appropriate , as a figure of speech . 
The problem is that President Bush meant it literally . 
I believe there is a direct connection between this and the abuse of detainees by US soldiers in Abu Ghraib prison . 
What happened at Abu Ghraib was not a case of a few bad apples , but a pattern tolerated and even encouraged by American authorities . 
For example , the Judge Advocate General Corps routinely observes military interrogations from behind a two-way mirror ; that practice was discontinued in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
The International Red Cross and others started complaining about abuses as early as December 2002 . 
It is easy to see how terrorism can lead to torture . 
Last summer , I took an informal poll at a meeting of Wall Street investors to find out whether they would condone the use of torture to prevent a terrorist attack . 
The consensus was that they hoped somebody would do it without their knowing about it . 
Americans , sadly , are now victims who have turned into perpetrators . 
Indeed , since September 2001 , the war on terror has claimed more innocent victims than those terrorist attacks . 
This fact is unrecognized at home because the victims of the war on terror are not Americans . 
The Bush administration knew what it was doing when it declared war on terror and used that pretext for invading Iraq . 
Perhaps Bush did not personally recognize this , but Vice President Dick Cheney and a group of extremists concentrated in and around the Pentagon did . 
These people are guided by the belief that international relations are relations of power , not law . 
Because America is the most powerful nation on earth , it ought to use that power more assertively . 
They advocated the overthrow of Saddam Hussein even before Bush was elected and won him to their cause after September 11 . 
The invasion of Afghanistan could be justified on the grounds that the Taliban provided Bin Laden and Al Qaeda with a secure training ground . 
Invading Iraq could not be similarly justified . 
Nevertheless , the ideologues in the administration were determined to pursue it because , in the words of Paul Wolfowitz , &quot; it was doable . &quot; 
President Bush managed to convince the nation that Saddam Hussein had some connection with the suicide bombers of September 11 , and that he possessed weapons of mass destruction . 
When both claims proved false , he argued that America invaded Iraq to liberate the Iraqi people . 
That claim was even more far-fetched . 
If America had really cared for the Iraqi people , more troops would have been sent to provide protection not only for the Ministry of Oil , but for museums and hospitals , too . 
Instead , Iraq was devastated by looting . 
Now that America &apos;s position has become unsustainable , the Bush administration is handing over power to local militias in Falluja and elsewhere . 
I would love to pin the blame for all this on Bush and his team . 
Indeed , after all that has happened , a majority of the US electorate continues to have confidence in Bush on national security matters . 
If this continues and Bush is reelected , Americans must ask the question : &quot; What is wrong with us ? &quot; 
America needs profound soul-searching . 
The terrorists seem to have hit upon a weak point in America &apos;s collective psyche . 
They have made Americans fearful and found a willing co-conspirator in the Bush administration . 
For reasons of its own , the Bush administration has found it advantageous to nurture the fear that September 11 engendered . 
By declaring war on terror , Bush united the country behind him . 
But fear is a bad counselor . 
By succumbing to fear Americans are doing the terrorists &apos; bidding : unleashing a vicious cycle of violence that may result in a permanent state of war . 
The war on terror need never end ; because the terrorists are invisible , they will never disappear . 
The war on terror polarizes the world . 
In battles for survival , whether in Yugoslavia or Israel , everyone sticks with his own tribe or nation , whether its policies are right or wrong . 
This is the state of mind that Bush sought to foster when he declared that those who are not &quot; with us &quot; are with the terrorists . 
That attitude cannot be reconciled with an open society , a concept based on the recognition that nobody possesses ultimate truth . 
Might is not necessarily right . 
It is not enough to reject the Bush administration &apos;s policies ; 
The war on terror is an aberration . 
America must defend itself against terrorist attacks , but that cannot be allowed to become the overarching objective of its existence . 
Today , no single country or combination of countries can stand up to American military might . 
The main threat to America &apos;s dominant position comes not from outside , but from within . 
If Americans fail to recognize that they may be wrong , they risk undermining the country &apos;s dominant position . 
Being the most powerful nation gives America privileges , but it also imposes obligations . 
If Americans want to preserve their privileged position , they must not use it to dictate to the rest of the world , but for the well being of others . 
Indeed , many problems-maintaining peace , ensuring law and order , protecting the environment , reducing poverty , and fighting terrorism-require collective action . 
Americans cannot do anything they want , but little can be done without US leadership or active participation . 
Instead of undermining and demeaning international institutions because they do not necessarily follow America &apos;s will , the US should strengthen and improve them . 
Instead of engaging in preemptive military actions , the US should pursue preventive actions of a constructive nature , creating a better balance between carrots and sticks in the prevailing world order .
