Inflation , the Fed , and the Big Picture 
CAMBRIDGE - Inflation - its causes and its connection to monetary policy and financial crises - was the theme of this year &apos;s international conference of central bankers and academics in Jackson Hole , Wyoming . 
But , while policymakers &quot; desire to be prepared for potential future risks to price stability is understandable , they did not place these concerns in the context of recent inflation developments at the global level - or within historical perspective . 
For the 189 countries for which data are available , median inflation for 2015 is running just below 2 % , slightly lower than in 2014 and , in most cases , below the International Monetary Fund &apos;s projections in its April World Economic Outlook . 
As the figure below shows , inflation in nearly half of all countries ( advanced and emerging , large and small ) is now at or below 2 % ( which is how most central bankers define price stability ) . 
Most of the other half are not doing badly , either . 
In the period following the oil shocks of the 1970s until the early 1980s , almost two-thirds of the countries recorded inflation rates above 10 % . 
According to the latest data , which runs through July or August for most countries , there are &quot; only &quot; 14 cases of high inflation ( the red line in the figure ) . 
Venezuela ( which has not published official inflation statistics this year ) and Argentina ( which has not released reliable inflation data for several years ) figure prominently in this group . 
Iran , Russia , Syria , Ukraine , and a handful of African countries comprise the rest . 
The share of countries recording outright deflation in consumer prices ( the green line ) is higher in 2015 than that of countries experiencing double-digit inflation ( 7 % of the total ) . 
Whatever nasty surprises may lurk in the future , the global inflation environment is the tamest since the early 1960s . 
Indeed , the risk for the world economy is actually tilted toward deflation for the 23 advanced economies in the sample , even eight years after the onset of the global financial crisis . 
For this group , the median inflation rate is 0.2 % - the lowest since 1933 . 
The only advanced economy with an inflation rate above 2 % is Iceland ( where the latest 12-month reading is 2.2 % ) . 
While we do not know what might have happened were policies different , one can easily imagine that , absent quantitative easing in the United States , Europe , and Japan , those economies would have been mired in a deflationary post-crisis landscape akin to that of the 1930s . 
Early in that terrible decade , deflation became a reality for nearly all countries and for all of the advanced economies . 
In the last two years , at least six of the advanced economies - and as many as eight - have been coping with deflation . 
Falling prices mean a rise in the real value of existing debts and an increase in the debt-service burden , owing to higher real interest rates . 
As a result , defaults , bankruptcies , and economic decline become more likely , putting further downward pressures on prices . 
Irving Fisher &apos;s prescient warning in 1933 about such a debt-deflation spiral resonates strongly today , given that public and private debt levels are at or near historic highs in many countries . 
Especially instructive is the 2.2 % price decline in Greece for the 12 months ending in July - the most severe example of ongoing deflation in the advanced countries and counterproductive to an orderly solution to the country &apos;s problems . 
Median inflation rates for emerging-market and developing economies , which were in double digits through the mid-1990s , are now around 2.5 % and falling . 
The sharp declines in oil and commodity prices during the latest supercycle have helped mitigate inflationary pressures , while the generalized slowdown in economic activity in the emerging world may have contributed as well . 
But it is too early to conclude that inflation is a problem of the past , because other external factors are working in the opposite direction . 
As Rodrigo Vergara , Governor of the Central Bank of Chile , observed in his prepared remarks at Jackson Hole , large currency depreciations in many emerging markets ( most notably some oil and commodity producers ) since the spring of 2013 have been associated with a rise in inflationary pressures in the face of wider output gaps . 
The analysis presented by Gita Gopinath , which establishes a connection between the price pass-through to prices from exchange-rate changes and the currency in which trade is invoiced , speaks plainly to this issue . 
Given that most emerging-market countries &quot; trade is conducted in dollars , currency depreciation should push up import prices almost one for one . 
At the end of the day , the US Federal Reserve will base its interest-rate decisions primarily on domestic considerations . 
While there is more than the usual degree of uncertainty regarding the magnitude of America &apos;s output gap since the financial crisis , there is comparatively less ambiguity now that domestic inflation is subdued . 
The rest of the world shares that benign inflation environment . 
As the Fed prepares for its September meeting , its policymakers would do well not to ignore what was overlooked in Jackson Hole : the need to place domestic trends in global and historical context . 
For now , such a perspective favors policy gradualism .
