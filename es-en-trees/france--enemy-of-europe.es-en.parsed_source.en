France , Enemy of Europe ? 
France under President Jacques Chirac is quickly becoming united Europe &apos;s biggest nightmare . 
It is bad enough Mr. Chirac is splitting Europe with the promotion of his so-called &quot; multi-polar &quot; foreign policy . 
Now France &apos;s blatant flaunting of the EU &apos;s Stability Pact , which caps deficit spending at 3 % of GDP , is speeding Europe to an important crossroads that threatens to undermine both European monetary union and the euro itself . 
The EU &apos;s smaller countries , in particular , are furious with France over its stubborn refusal to play by the EU &apos;s deficit spending rules . 
They see French defiance as more than just a narrow issue over fiscal numbers . 
&quot; It concerns whether the big countries are willing to sacrifice any measure of national sovereignty for the European good , &quot; said one influential ECB official . 
&quot; The Germans at least are trying to rein in their deficits , &quot; the official went on . 
&quot; But the French simply do not care . &quot; 
The act precipitating the current crisis is France &apos;s decision to go ahead with the cut in the personal income tax Chirac promised during his election campaign of last year . 
The tax cut will put France &apos;s fiscal deficit over the 3 % limit three years in a row - at an estimated 4.5 % of GDP for 2004 - because it will not be financed by offsetting cuts in public expenditure . 
Of course , some believe an income tax cut is precisely what the French economy needs . 
Perhaps . 
But as attractive as an income tax cut may look on narrow nationalistic grounds , there is more than just the French national interest to be considered . 
For if France can get away with its flagrant violation of the Stability Pact rules , others will follow the French lead . 
An orgy of deficit spending throughout the euro-zone economy is certain to result , as welfare state pressure groups in individual member states attempt to make up for prior restraint . 
This will cause many to have second thoughts about European monetary union . 
After all , who wants a monetary union that bloats the welfare state and is an engine for inflation ? 
Moreover , once the constraints on deficit spending are off , a major incentive for badly needed structural reform in Europe will be removed . 
Europe &apos;s politicians will be tempted to simply jack up the fiscal deficit to boost domestic incomes rather than undergo politically painful but necessary rationalization . 
Structural stagflation - high inflation and low economic growth - will result . 
The EU Commission must act now or face a possible revolt from the smaller countries . 
Sweden &apos;s rejection of the euro already has sounded the alarm . 
Hitting the French with a hefty fine - the penalty provided by the Stability Pact - is not a good idea . 
Under its current rules , three big countries ( France , Germany , and Italy ) could - and probably would - block the sanction . 
Even if the penalty were imposed , the French would not pay . 
France &apos;s occupation of the Netherlands during the so-called French Period at the turn of the 19th century suggests a better alternative . 
France then imposed a penalty tax on the province of Zeeland for running a sizeable fiscal deficit . 
When the Zeelanders refused to pay , the French responded by centralizing what had been until that point a rather de-centralized Dutch fiscal system . 
What worked then may work now . 
Centralization of the public finances of member states , though a radical step , may be the only answer to the problem of recalcitrant countries like France that refuse to play by the budget rules . 
After all , the Stability Pact exists in the first place because Europe lacks a common fiscal policy . 
The issue of how much of a double standard the EU &apos;s smaller countries are willing to accept has been brought to a head by President Chirac &apos;s blatant flaunting of the Stability Pact rules . 
By rejecting the euro , Sweden , itself a small country , made it clear that it didn &apos;t want to be part of a Europe that discriminated against small countries . 
What will it take , one wonders , before others among the smaller member countries follow suit ?
