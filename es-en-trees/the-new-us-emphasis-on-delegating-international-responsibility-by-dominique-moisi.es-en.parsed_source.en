America by Proxy ? 
PARIS - The demise of the Roman Empire resulted from a combination of strategic overreach and excessive delegation of security responsibilities to newcomers . 
Without making undue comparisons , the question for the United States today is whether it can remain the world &apos;s leading power while delegating to others or to technological tools the task of protecting its global influence . 
Drones and allies - non-human weapons and non-American soldiers - have become central to America &apos;s military doctrine . 
Leading the world in technological prowess while leading it from behind in terms of combat forces on the ground , if not in the air , America &apos;s shift of emphasis is impossible to ignore . 
First there was the combined French and British action in Libya that led to the overthrow of Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s regime ; then came French intervention in Mali , and now Israeli airstrikes in Syria . 
Each case is , of course , utterly different , but all have something in common : America has not been on the front line of intervention . 
Yet , without direct US military support or indirect ( and in some cases implicit ) political support , it is difficult to imagine that such risky operations would have been launched . 
Have the British , French , and even Israelis become armed extensions of the US in their respective spheres of influence ? 
If so , the contrast with the recent past could hardly be starker . 
In the aftermath of the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 , Americans simply could not envisage sharing their security responsibilities with others . 
At best , Europeans could be America &apos;s &quot; cleaning ladies , &quot; to use the indelicate analogy coined at the time by some neo-conservative thinkers during George W. Bush &apos;s first term in office . 
But , even before September 2001 , some US conservatives had expressed disdain toward their European allies . 
I still remember the warning uttered by a top US diplomat in Strasbourg in the early 1990 &quot; s , on the eve of the Balkan wars . 
&quot; If we leave Europeans in charge of themselves , they will prove irresponsible , divisive , and suicidal , and then we will have to rescue them from themselves . &quot; 
Today , Americans are only too happy to rely on the military competence and interventionist inclinations of some ( in fact , very few ) of their European friends . 
It would be easy to interpret this shift as a response to the human and economic cost of America &apos;s interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
The reality is more complex . 
America &apos;s newfound taste for delegating military responsibilities to others is not the result of a series of events , but the product of a long-term process driven by America &apos;s simultaneous ambivalence toward the world and active engagement with it . 
Is it worth fighting for a world that cannot be saved , and that only invites murky , inconclusive entanglements ? 
From this perspective , America &apos;s involvement in World War I and , even more so , in World War II , are exceptions to the rule . 
The US troops that landed on Normandy beaches in June 1944 were animated by a strong sense of mission . 
They knew that they were fighting evil in an environment that was historically and culturally familiar . 
In Vietnam , US soldiers , many of them black , often did not understand why they were fighting . 
In Iraq , their equivalents were very often Latinos for whom integration into American society - including , for many , the promise of permanent residence or citizenship - was at least as important as toppling Saddam Hussein . 
When a country engages in the world , its authority stems from its willingness and ability to take &quot; personal &quot; risks . 
Its authority is diminished when the perceived gap between the value of its population &apos;s lives and the lives of its enemies is too wide . 
In this respect , drone warfare reinforces the perverse nature of &quot; asymmetrical wars . &quot; 
In her recent book Drone Warfare : Killing by Remote Control , Medea Benjamin , a peace activist and shrewd observer of international relations , makes a crucial point : &quot; While drones make it easier to kill some bad guys , they also make it easier to go to war . &quot; 
Likewise , delegating security to allies can have perverse psychological effects . 
This is particularly true in the Middle East . 
How can the US exert pressure on Israel to engage in serious negotiations with the Palestinians , or to refrain from attacking Iran , when it offers encouragement - if only through public silence - to Israeli military intervention in Syria ? 
If America &apos;s purpose is to deliver a message to Iran - &quot; Beware , you could be the next target &quot; - many will question its sincerity about restraining Israel . 
For some , the US has moved from too much engagement under Bush to doing too little under Barack Obama . 
For others , Obama is merely pursuing Bush &apos;s foreign policy through other means - drones instead of soldiers . 
The reality is probably somewhere in between . 
Precisely because America remains indispensable to international security , one wishes that its leaders would act in a more discerning way . 
In international politics , as in education , there is no such thing as care by proxy . 
If responsibility is to be exercised effectively , it cannot be delegated to machines or other countries .
