An Answer to the Russian Challenge 
BERLIN - For 19 years , the West ( America and Europe ) has been putting off answering a critical strategic question : what role should post-Soviet Russia actually play globally and in the European order ? 
Should it be treated as a difficult partner or a strategic adversary ? 
Even when this choice became critically acute during the crisis of Russia &apos;s short war against Georgia last summer , the West didn &apos;t provide a conclusive answer to this question . 
If you follow most East Europeans , the United Kingdom and the Bush administration , the answer is &quot; strategic adversary . &quot; 
These seemingly mutually exclusive alternatives have one thing in common : neither of them has been thought through to the end . 
If you see Russia as a strategic adversary - and the restoration of Great Russian power politics under Vladimir Putin , to the detriment of the rule of law in domestic and foreign policy , does indeed speak for it - then the West should fundamentally change its agenda . 
While Russia is no longer the superpower it was in the Soviet era , militarily it is still a great power , at least in Europe and Asia . 
To address the numerous regional conflicts ( Iran , Middle East , Afghanistan / Pakistan , Central Asia , North Korea ) and global challenges ( climate protection , disarmament , arms control , nuclear anti-proliferation , energy security ) that have high priority on the Western agenda , cooperation with Russia is necessary . 
A strategic confrontation with Moscow , i.e. , a new kind of &quot; mini-Cold War , &quot; would undermine this agenda , or at least complicate its implementation significantly . 
So the question is simply whether the threat emanating from Russia is so grave that this kind of strategic reorientation on the part of the West is required ? 
I believe it is not . 
Putin &apos;s claim to great-power status and his great-power policies are structurally very vulnerable . 
And he knows that . 
Demographically , Russia is in a dramatic nose-dive ; it remains economically and socially backward ; its infrastructure is underdeveloped , as are its investments in education and vocational training . 
Economically , it mainly relies on energy and commodity exports , and in its modernization efforts , it is largely dependent on the West , particularly Europe . 
Due to its geopolitical position and its potential , however , Russia will remain a permanent strategic factor in Europe and Asia that cannot be ignored . 
To integrate the country into a strategic partnership is therefore in the West &apos;s interest . 
But this would require a Western policy based on long-term thinking and a self-confident and strong power position , because the Kremlin will perceive any sign of division and weakness as encouragement to return to Great Russian power politics . 
A few months ago , the Russian government came up with a proposal to negotiate a new European order within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe . 
Russia considers the agreements from the 1990 &quot; s unjust , based as they were on its weakness at the time , and it wants to revise them . 
Moscow &apos;s main strategic objective is the weakening or even roll-back of NATO as an Ant-Russian military alliance and the re-establishment of its East European and Central Asian zones of influence . 
But Putin is making a big mistake here , because all these aims are unacceptable for the West , and the Kremlin still doesn &apos;t seem to understand that the best and most effective guarantee of NATO &apos;s existence was , is , and will continue to be an aggressive Russian foreign policy . 
In the former mother country of Marxism-Leninism , the leaders still don &apos;t seem to understand dialectics . 
After all , if Russia &apos;s government really wanted to achieve a change in the post-Soviet status quo , it should , first and foremost , pursue a policy vis-Ã -vis its neighbors that reduces rather than increases fears . 
But this applies similarly , if in reverse , to the West : on the one hand , the principles of a new Europe as defined by the OSCE after 1989 / 1990 don &apos;t allow decisions about alliances to be subject to the veto of a large neighbor . 
The same is true for free and secret elections and the inviolability of borders . 
On the other hand , the missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic , and the prospect of NATO accession for Georgia and Ukraine , assume confrontation where this was not at all necessary . 
The West should not reject Russia &apos;s wish for new negotiations on a European security system . 
NATO must play the central role here , because it is indispensable for the vast majority of Europeans and for America . 
The possible trade-off could be that the existing principles and institutions of the post-Soviet European order , including NATO , remain unchanged and are accepted and implemented by Russia , which would get a significantly enhanced role within NATO , including the perspective of full membership . 
The peripheral nature of the NATO-Russia Council was clearly not enough and did not work . 
But why not think about transforming NATO into a real European security system , including Russia ? 
The rules of the game would be changed and a whole variety of strategic goals could be achieved - European security , neighborhood conflicts , energy security , arms reduction , anti-proliferation , etc . Yes , such a bold step would transform NATO . 
Of course , this approach presupposes two things that don &apos;t exist at the moment : a common transatlantic approach to dealing with Russia , and a European Union that acts in much greater unison and is therefore stronger . 
Nonetheless , the challenge posed by Russia does not allow any further procrastination . 
There is simply too much at stake .
