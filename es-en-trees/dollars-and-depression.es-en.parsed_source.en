Dollars and Depression 
The falling dollar has emerged as a source of profound global macroeconomic distress . 
The question now is how bad that distress will become . 
Is the world economy at risk ? 
There are two possibilities . 
If global savers and investors expect the dollar &apos;s depreciation to continue , they will flee the currency unless they are compensated appropriately for keeping their money in the US and its assets , implying that the gap between US and foreign interest rates will widen . 
As a result , the cost of capital in the US will soar , discouraging investment and reducing consumption spending as high interest rates depress the value of households &quot; principal assets : their houses . 
The resulting recession might fuel further pessimism and cutbacks in spending , deepening the downturn . 
A US in recession would no longer serve as the world &apos;s importer of last resort , which might send the rest of the world into recession as well . 
A world in which everybody expects a falling dollar is a world in economic crisis . 
By contrast , a world in which the dollar has already fallen is one that may see economic turmoil , but not an economic crisis . 
If the dollar has already fallen - if nobody expects it to fall much more - then there is no reason to compensate global savers and investors for holding US assets . 
On the contrary , in this scenario there are opportunities : the dollar , after all , might rise ; 
Of course , there may well be turbulence : when US wage levels appear low because of a weak dollar , it is hard to export to America , and other countries must rely on other sources of demand to maintain full employment . 
The government may have to shore up the financial system if the changes in asset prices that undermined the dollar sink risk-loving or imprudent lenders . 
But these are , or ought to be , problems that we can solve . 
By contrast , sky-high US interest rates produced by a general expectation of a massive ongoing dollar decline is a macroeconomic problem without a solution . 
Yet so far there are no signs that global savers and investors expect a dollar decline . 
The large gap between US and foreign long-term interest rates that should emerge from and signal expectations of a falling dollar does not exist . 
And the $ 65 billion needed every month to fund the US current-account deficit continues to flow in . 
Thus , the world economy may dodge yet another potential catastrophe . 
That may still prove to be wishful thinking . 
After all , America &apos;s still-large current-account deficit guarantees that the dollar will continue to fall . 
Even so , the macroeconomic logic that large current-account deficits signal that currencies are overvalued continues to escape the world &apos;s international financial investors and speculators . 
On one level , this is very frustrating : we economists believe that people are smart enough to understand their situation and capable enough to pursue their own interests . 
Yet the typical investor in dollar-denominated assets - whether a rich private individual , a pension fund , or a central bank - has not taken the steps to protect themselves against the very likely dollar decline in our future . 
In this case , what is bad for economists is good for the world economy : we may be facing a mere episode of financial distress in the US rather than sky-high long-term interest rates and a depression . 
The fact that economists can &apos;t explain it is no reason not to be thankful .
