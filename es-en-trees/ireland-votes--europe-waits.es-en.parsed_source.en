Ireland Votes , Europe Waits 
MAYNOOTH , IRELAND - On June 12 , Irish voters will vote on the European Union &apos;s Lisbon Treaty , the instrument designed to improve the efficiency and legitimacy of the now 27-member bloc . 
Ireland is the only country to put the Treaty to a referendum - all the other member states have chosen to ratify the Treaty by parliamentary means - and everything indicates that the result will be close . 
For Prime Minister Brian Cowen &apos;s new government , the risk is that a &quot; No &quot; to the Lisbon Treaty would cripple his administration in its infancy . 
For the EU , Irish rejection of the Treaty would probably trigger a lengthy period of instability , and perhaps even an end to the European integration process as it is now constituted . 
In 2001 , Irish voters rejected the Nice Treaty , which threw the EU into a protracted period of crisis and introspection , which ended only with agreement on the so-called Constitutional Treaty in 2005 . 
Almost immediately , however , French and Dutch voters rejected that Treaty , bringing the negotiations back to square one . 
Now , after a lengthy and difficult period of reflection and bargaining , those efforts may be in jeopardy again . 
The &quot; No &quot; campaign has been vigorous , comprising a motley crew of aging Marxists , anti-globalization protestors , traditional euroskeptics , and obsessive &quot; sovereigntists . &quot; 
They have sought to capitalize on the vacuum of knowledge in Ireland regarding EU affairs and the &quot; Yes &quot; side &apos;s relative lateness to mobilize . 
Voters have been subjected to a barrage of outlandish claims : the Treaty would supposedly introduce abortion into Ireland ( it is outlawed under Ireland &apos;s constitution ) , abolish Ireland &apos;s low corporate-tax rate , and introduce a European army that would soon be sending Irish boys home from distant battlefields in body bags . 
Even Ireland &apos;s dismal performance at the recent Eurovision Song Contest has been used to bolster the message : &quot; They didn &apos;t vote for us ; why should we vote for them ? &quot; 
Though these claims are easily discredited , the &quot; Yes &quot; side has been unable to provide voters with sufficient reasons to vote for the Treaty . 
If that wasn &apos;t enough , the &quot; No &quot; side has also been able to associate the EU with rising fuel and food prices as the campaign draws to a close . 
Two factors that are likely to decide the referendum &apos;s outcome can be singled out : turnout and how the farming community votes . 
Opinion polls currently show the &quot; Yes &quot; side leading by two to one ( 35 % to 18 % ) . 
But there is little comfort in these figures for pro-Europeans : polls prior to the failed referendum on the Nice treaty in 2001 demonstrated an even larger &quot; Yes &quot; majority at the same stage . 
Now as then , &quot; No &quot; voters seem more committed . 
The percentage of &quot; Don &apos;t knows &quot; remains high , at about 47 % , so there is everything to play for in the campaign &apos;s final days . 
The crucial issue will be turnout . 
In 2001 the &quot; Yes &quot; side lost because it failed to convince enough voters to turn out - almost two thirds of the electorate failed to vote . 
In 2002 a second referendum was held which reversed the result and saw the &quot; Yes &quot; side triumph . 
A good part of the explanation for this turnaround was the fact that the government managed to convince enough voters to move from abstention to the &quot; Yes &quot; camp ( though the turnout still failed to reach 50 % ) . All of this suggests that the higher the turnout the greater the likelihood of a &quot; Yes &quot; win . 
For Irish farmers the campaign has delivered a golden opportunity to engage in a tactical assault on Brussels . 
They have sought to link the Treaty to the ongoing Doha Round of World Trade Organization talks . 
Peter Mandelson , the EU &apos;s trade commissioner , has been routinely presented as public enemy number one with his proposals to reduce some agricultural tariffs by up to 70 % . 
Farming organizations threaten to withhold support for the Treaty unless the government threatens to veto Mandelson &apos;s proposals . 
Although the Irish Farmers Association ( IFA ) has belatedly urged its 85,000 members to support the Treaty , opinion polls show farmers are opposed to Lisbon by a two to one majority . 
Their votes could prove crucial in a tight contest . 
From the outside looking in it seems almost perverse that Irish voters might reject the Lisbon Treaty . 
After all Ireland has benefited more than other state from the European integration process , garnering almost â‚¬ 60billion in EU subsidies during 35 years of membership . 
But in a context where the EU remains too remote from citizens and where apathy and confusion define the referendum campaign , the &quot; No &quot; side has cleverly packaged its message of Europe as an existential threat to Irish jobs , investment and sovereignty . 
Ireland , long one of the EU &apos;s bright spots , will be a source of great anxiety in the days to come .
