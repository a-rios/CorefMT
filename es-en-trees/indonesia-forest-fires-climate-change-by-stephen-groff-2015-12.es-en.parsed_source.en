Putting out Indonesia &apos;s Fires 
MANILA - Every year , forest fires ravage Indonesia , causing massive environmental , social , and economic devastation . 
This year &apos;s fires are the largest in nearly 20 years , destroying three million hectares of land and causing an estimated $ 14 billion in losses related to agriculture , forest degradation , health , transportation , and tourism . 
Perhaps even more alarming is the climate impact . 
Indonesia is already among the world &apos;s biggest carbon emitters . 
Thanks to the fires , its daily average emissions this September and October were ten times higher than normal . 
On October 14 alone , emissions from the fires soared to 61 megatons - nearly 97 % of the country &apos;s total emissions for that day . 
As a result , this year &apos;s fires - coming just weeks before the current United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris , where world leaders plan to finalize a global pact limiting carbon emissions - have underscored the urgent need for Indonesia and its development partners to act quickly to address this regional and global scourge . 
If we don &apos;t , climate change will be even more difficult to combat . 
The cause of Indonesia &apos;s recurring infernos is the common practice of lighting fires to clear land for palm oil production , exacerbated by a prolonged dry spell partly attributable to El Ni√±o . 
While stricter enforcement of rules against deliberate fires in Indonesia &apos;s 1999 Basic Forestry Law and the 2014 Law on Plantations will help , far more needs to be done . 
The reason is simple : Indonesia &apos;s fires aren &apos;t your typical forest fires . 
The ground holds peat - dense organic matter in the process of becoming coal . 
When the peat ignites , the fire can creep beneath the surface and erupt somewhere else , days or weeks later . 
And , like coal , peat stores massive amounts of carbon , which is released into the atmosphere when the land is burned , cleared , and drained to make way for plantations . 
The scale of the fires reflects the difficulty of the enforcement challenge the authorities face . 
It is much cheaper for farmers to clear land with fire than by other means . 
Moreover , farmers have few alternatives to operating palm oil or timber plantations.So every dry season , more and more land is burned . 
And every year , the fallout widens . 
An estimated 75 million people have been exposed to the smoke this year , and 500,000 in Indonesia alone are believed to have contracted fire-related respiratory illnesses . 
Five key steps - all being actively debated in Indonesia - would help prevent the fires . 
For starters , the licenses awarded to develop peatlands should be revoked , and concessions should be taken away from landholders if there are fires . 
Moreover , a moratorium on new forest clearing should be enforced through local communities . 
Re-wetting peatlands and the restoration of degraded peat forests should be the next step , followed by the creation of early warning systems to detect and control forest fires . 
Finally , with the support of the private sector , Indonesia needs to establish a community-based forest management system . 
Regional cooperation also holds great promise . 
Indonesia and Malaysia , which together account for 85 % of the world palm oil market , have agreed to establish the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries , which will harmonize standards and promote environmentally sustainable production practices . 
To build on this , consumers and markets also need to send signals to companies that directly or indirectly support slash-and-burn farming . 
The 2014 Indonesia Palm Oil Pledge - in which five major producers committed to more sustainable solutions that preclude deforestation , respect human and community rights , and deliver shareholder value - is a good model . 
Small farmers need options other than slash-and-burn farming to boost their meager incomes . 
There is a clear need for an integrated land-management approach involving conservation , rehabilitation , investment in sustainable livelihoods , and institutional reforms . 
There is also a growing consensus on the need for broader industry standards for sustainable production and processing of agricultural commodities . 
Multilateral development institutions such as the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) have a role to play in providing support to ensure that systems , capacity , and market-access initiatives are undertaken in ways that improve compliance . 
And national and local regulatory reforms that improve land-use planning , create incentives for forest conservation , and promote the use of low-carbon land must also be supported . 
Indonesia is firmly committed to clean , sustainable development . 
It recently pledged to reduce its CO2 emissions by 29 % through unilateral measures by 2030 , and by 41 % with international support . 
Putting out Indonesia &apos;s forest fires for good will be crucial to meeting these targets . 
For the sake of the planet , all of us need to grab a bucket .
