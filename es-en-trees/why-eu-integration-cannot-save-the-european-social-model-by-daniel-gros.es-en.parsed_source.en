Will More Integration Save Europe &apos;s Social Model ? 
BRUSSELS - At high-level gatherings of the European Union elite , one often hears the following type of statement : &quot; Europe must integrate and centralize economic governance in order to defend its social model in an age of globalization . &quot; 
European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso and his counterpart at the European Council , Herman van Rompuy , are particularly keen on this argument . 
But the claim that only deeper EU integration can save the &quot; European &quot; social model from the onslaught of emerging markets is not true . 
Yes , globalization represents a challenge to all EU member states ; but it is not clear how more integration would help them to confront it . 
More European economic governance is not a panacea . 
In fact , it is not even clear which European social model needs to be saved . 
There are enormous differences among EU members in terms of the size of their public sectors , the flexibility of their labor markets , and almost any socio-economic indicator that one can think of . 
The common elements that are usually identified with the &quot; European &quot; social model are a quest for equality and a strong welfare state . 
But neither of the main problems confronting Europe &apos;s social-security systems - slow economic growth and aging populations ( a function of low fertility ) - can be addressed at the European level . 
This is obvious for fertility , which is determined by deeper social and demographic trends that cannot really be influenced by government action . 
And , while aging could be transformed into an opportunity if the elderly could be made more productive , this requires action at the national and societal levels , not more European integration . 
It is understandable that European leaders talk so much about globalization , given that the European economy is rather open for its size , with exports amounting to about 20 % of GDP , compared to just 12 % in the US . 
The ( re- ) emergence of big economies like China is thus bound to have a greater impact on Europe than on the US . 
Economists long ago recognized that it is theoretically possible that the emergence of new growth poles abroad does more harm than good to an economy . 
This can happen if the new economic powers are more important as competitors than they are as customers . 
The EU does have a bilateral trade deficit with China , but it also exports a lot to the Chinese market - much more than the US does . 
More important , even if one accepts the view that globalization constitutes a threat to Europe &apos;s social model , there is little scope for further integration , given that trade policy is already fully unified at the EU level . 
In any case , the EU has generally contributed constructively to all major rounds of global trade liberalization . 
With the EU helping to keep global markets open , European exports have held up rather well , with the EU maintaining its market share . 
Although it has lost ground relative to the emerging markets ( especially China ) , it has far outperformed other developed economies like the US and Japan . 
This is true even in services , despite slow productivity growth in Europe . 
It is thus wrong to assume that economies based on cheap labor are massively outcompeting the EU . 
Moreover , this relatively good trade performance has been achieved with a much lower increase in wage inequality in Europe than in the US . 
The various European social models have thus been , on average , quite robust - most likely because of the absence of a master plan from Brussels on how to respond to globalization . 
Each member country has had to adapt in its own way , knowing that it could not bend the rules of the game in its own favor . 
Not all succeeded ; but the successes ( Germany , for example ) far outweigh the failures ( see Greece ) . 
The key to ensuring the future of Europe &apos;s social-security systems , and thus its social model , is faster growth . 
The obstacles to growth are well known , and have existed for a long time without being removed . 
The reason is quite simple : if there were a politically easy way to generate growth , it would have been implemented already . 
Moreover , most national policymakers have a tendency to blame &quot; Brussels &quot; for all of their difficult choices , thus creating the impression at home that the economy would improve if economic affairs could be managed without EU interference . 
More integration is preached at the European level , but implicitly portrayed at home as an obstacle to growth . 
This double-speak on the part of national political elites is perceived as such by voters , whose trust in both national and EU institutions is naturally declining . 
The claim that Europe needs more integration to save its social model has long lost credibility . 
Integration is irrelevant to that question , and , in those areas where deeper integration really would benefit Europe , it appears to be the last thing that national leaders want .
