The Greek Time Bomb 
ATHENS - Much is at stake in Greece &apos;s upcoming election . 
Indeed , the outcome could determine whether the country remains in the eurozone , with far-reaching implications for the rest of the monetary union . 
Syriza , a radical left-wing party whose popularity has skyrocketed amid the country &apos;s economic crisis , is the favorite to win , though it is unlikely to gain enough parliamentary seats to govern alone . 
Fundamental to Syriza &apos;s platform is its economic program , designed to counteract the impact of the excessively strict austerity that Greeks have endured for the last four and a half years , in exchange for bailouts from the &quot; troika &quot; of the European Central Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and the European Commission . 
Pensions have been reduced by 40 % , on average , while the middle class is suffering under the weight of crippling new property taxes . 
As a result , Greece has fallen into a deep and prolonged recession , with output down 25 % from pre-crisis levels . 
Worse , unemployment stands at nearly 26 % - and more than 50 % among young people . 
Yet most unemployment benefits are now being eliminated after 12 months , with the long-term unemployed often losing access to the state health-care system . 
Add to this a 30 % increase in prices for prescription drugs , and it is easy to see why Greek society is unraveling . 
Of course , these sacrifices might be worthwhile were they helping Greece reduce its public debt to manageable levels . 
Servicing that debt would require primary budget surpluses equal to at least 4 % of GDP until 2022 - an outcome that would require a surge in growth . 
Under the weight of relentless fiscal austerity , however , such growth is out of the question . 
That is why Syriza has promised to launch a massive new spending program - including free electricity and food coupons for the poor and an increase in state pensions to pre-crisis levels - that would cost about 6.5 % of GDP . 
Tax hikes for high-income earners and large property owners would help to finance these expenditures , while increases in the minimum wage would round out income redistribution efforts . 
Syriza has also promised to repeal labor-market liberalization and suspend privatization . 
Finally , it plans to renegotiate Greece &apos;s debt with lenders , in the hope of writing off the bulk of its liabilities . 
Syriza &apos;s economic program neglects the important fact that fiscal consolidation and structural measures not only form part of Greece &apos;s commitments ; they also serve the country &apos;s long-term interest . 
Given this , they cannot - and should not - be abolished . 
Instead , the problems in their design and implementation should be addressed , in order to improve their effectiveness within current economic circumstances . 
Such an approach would strengthen Syriza &apos;s position in debt-relief negotiations . 
Nonetheless , official statements suggest that the troika would not be inclined to accept Syriza &apos;s negotiating framework , intending instead to complete the talks that it had launched with the outgoing center-right government , the goal being to securing further budget cuts and initiate new labor-market and pension reforms . 
In short , the troika will insist that Greece honors its prior commitments . 
If negotiations stall , financial and liquidity stress , resulting from Greece &quot; inability to borrow at current interest rates - ten-year bond yields have reached 9.5 % - will weaken the fiscal position and banking system further . 
In that case , Greece &apos;s geopolitical position would be weakened , its economy would sink further into recession , and social tensions would rise . 
Moreover , instability would become chronic , because the eurozone would no longer offer a backstop for fiscal and financial laxity . 
Eurozone authorities may claim that a Greek exit no longer poses a systemic risk , given the introduction in recent years of various instruments for fighting financial crises , including government-backed rescue funds , a partial banking union , tougher fiscal controls , and the European Central Bank &apos;s new role as lender of last resort . 
A Greek exit may serve as a warning to countries like Spain , Italy , and France , where strong anti-Europe or anti-establishment parties are on the rise . 
So long as performance gaps continue to widen , voters will continue to challenge European integration . 
Only further unification , underpinned by growth-oriented policies in the struggling countries , can reverse this trend . 
Such an outcome is still possible - but only if the relevant actors recognize the risks associated with a Greek exit from the eurozone . 
A Syriza-led government must moderate its approach and promise that it will continue to pursue reform and limit spending in exchange for a substantial reduction to its debt burden - a reduction that the troika must be willing to grant .
