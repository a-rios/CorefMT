DNA : Oracle or Nemesis ? 
NEW YORK : Throughout history , shamans and soothsayers , wizards and witches have tried to read and tame the future . 
Today , geneticists have joined the prediction business . 
Based on research , biotechnology companies have invested in sequencing technologies and developed predictive tests to identify those who are asymptomatic , but genetically predisposed to a growing number of genetic diseases and more common disorders such as certain types of cancer . 
Some scientists , indeed , are convinced that genetic tests will eventually help predict behavioral tendencies and personality traits - including predispositions to mental illness , homosexuality , addiction , even risk taking , timidity , and religiosity . 
In futuristic scenarios , they promise that genetic information will enhance control over both behavior and disease . 
Genetic tests differ significantly from other clinical tests . 
They can be used to detect a condition in healthy people who have no reason to suspect they are at risk . 
They provide probabilistic information about a person &apos;s predisposition to a disease that may or may not occur far in the future ; they provide information that implicates not only the future of the individual but of family members as well . 
There are among the many dangers that lurk here and many parties have less than a detached interest in this issue . 
Some people hope that predictive information will open therapeutic possibilities . 
But even when genetic tests correctly predict that a person is at risk , there may be little or no benefit from that knowledge . 
Despite decades of promises , tests are available far in advance of therapies . 
On the other hand , once identified , a genetic predisposition to a debilitating disease for which there is no cure may immediately expose a person to stigmatization and discrimination . 
A person &quot; predisposed &quot; to cancer , say , may have the biological qualities that heighten the odds of developing cancer , but many variables will influence the actual expression of the disease . 
In its social meaning , however , a predisposition is often defined as equivalent to having the disease . 
In a non-clinical context , individuals at risk in the future may be regarded as deserving differential treatment before it is known whether or not the disease will ever occur . 
Carrying the trait for a disorder , they can be labeled as &quot; persons at risk &quot; and deemed unsuited for normal activities . 
Genetic labeling may create an underclass of individuals whose genes condemn them to discrimination . 
For this reason , many people who know they are at risk for a disease because of their family history have chosen not to be tested . 
Among people at risk for Huntington &apos;s Disease , for example , about 15 % spurn taking the test that would provide definitive information . 
Individuals considering genetic testing thus face difficult questions . 
Of what use is genetic information about a disease when there are no therapeutic options ? 
Should a healthy woman diagnosed as susceptible to breast cancer undergo a prophylactic mastectomy ? 
What are the implications of genetic screening for family planning ? 
Eliminating genetic conditions ultimately depends on controlling reproduction . 
But policies of gene selection that may reduce the burden of disease border on the nightmare of eugenic controls . 
While the patient may derive limited or no benefit from testing , others may have great interest in administering it . 
Predictive information allows various organizations to reduce costs or increase profits . 
The rising cost of medical care and insurance , for example , encourages insurance companies to try to weed out those who may have &quot; unprofitable , &quot; i.e. , reimbursable , illnesses . 
The need for profit encourages employers to give genetic tests to workers to discover who may be most productive , or who may be prone to illness that might lead to costly claims for compensation . 
Companies using toxic materials want to anticipate which workers may be genetically sensitive to toxic exposure . 
Schools , motor vehicle bureaus , adoption agencies , mortgage lenders , organ transplant registries all have a stake in information about genetic predispositions . 
But above all , pressures from a biotechnology industry that stands to profit from the proliferation of tests drives the expansion of genetic testing . 
There are more than 450 research programs in America developing genetic tests . 
The commercial stakes are growing as it becomes possible to test for predisposition to common diseases such as breast cancer and heart disease where the potential market is immense . 
Genetic prediction marks the intersection of scientific possibilities , economic interests , and consumer hopes and expectations . 
The ability to predict a growing number of complex and common diseases encourages testing , but also creates ethical dilemmas . 
The institutional interest in the predictive information from genetic tests conflicts with the rights and interests of individuals . 
Efforts to predict predisposition to behavior ( as opposed to disease ) will only compound these conflicts . 
Today genetic tests yield probabilities and uncertain , inadequate information . 
But even if perfected , how should this information be used ? 
Can we avoid the creation of a genetic underclass ? 
Should we be seeking &quot; genetic fixes &quot; or ways to re-engineer the genes we pass on to our children ? 
As we seek to control disease , can we afford to mandate controls over reproduction ? 
Such questions will have increasing salience in light of the concerns about economic efficiency and cost containment that are shaping the efforts of today &apos;s shamans to read , assess , and tame the future in this , the age of biotechnology .
