A New Deal for Fragile States 
PARIS - Today , roughly one-quarter of the world &apos;s population lives in conflict-affected and fragile states . 
Despite vast sums of money spent aiding such states over the last 50 years , armed conflict and violence continue to blight the lives of millions of people around the world . 
International and national partners must radically change the way they engage such states . 
I experienced firsthand the need for a new approach in 2004 in Sri Lanka . 
Within the first two months of the devastating tsunami that struck that December , close to 50 heads of state and foreign ministers visited the island . 
Each came with their own programs , their own civil-society organizations , and their own television crews . 
Few came with any deep understanding of the dynamics of the political conflict between militant Tamils and the Sri Lankan state . 
Big mistakes were made , fueling further violence . 
Our major challenge today is to move away from the model of partnership according to which priorities , policies , and funding needs are determined in donor capitals and development partners &quot; headquarters . 
Conflict-affected states need to be able to determine their own destinies . 
We should establish models of post-conflict transition like the one advocated by the g7 + , a group of eighteen fragile states . 
The model is simple : Countries assess their own situation , using tools that they develop and that are appropriate to the context , in order to formulate a vision and a plan to consolidate peace and achieve prosperity . 
This may sound like pie in the sky , but we have already tasted it in Africa , where Sierra Leone &apos;s Agenda for Prosperity 2013-2017 and the Liberia Vision 2030 exemplify the potential of such programs . 
Progress on meeting national priorities such as peace consolidation , expanding access to justice , or increasing security is monitored locally . 
Using local systems and capacities , it turns out , can strengthen them . 
The &quot; New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States , &quot; which builds on a series of international commitments regarding aid and development , and was endorsed at the at the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan , South Korea in 2011 , proposes just such a model . 
It enshrines what matters most in building peaceful states and societies : commitments - the Peace- and State-building Goals - to improve how national and international partners engage in conflict-affected and fragile contexts . 
The New Deal recognizes what the history of peace-building teaches us : national leadership and ownership of agendas are key to achieving visible and sustainable results . 
As Kosti Manibe Ngai , South Sudan &apos;s finance minister , has put it , &quot; Nothing about us without us . &quot; 
In many conversations with South Sudan &apos;s president , Salva Kiir , we have discussed setting out a short list of clear priorities for the new state . 
But such goals are meaningful only if a fragile state &apos;s partners are ready to accept the lead from a capital like Juba rather than from their own headquarters . 
More than 40 countries and institutions have endorsed the New Deal way of working , committing themselves to building better partnerships - and to investing the required resources and political capital . 
This is why the New Deal model is innovative ; it creates political support around issues that need to be addressed if countries are to make the transition from conflict and fragility to peace and stability . 
Supporting inclusive political dialogue and ensuring that conflict is resolved through peaceful means are the highest priorities , as are security , access to justice , and a dynamic private sector that generates sufficient job opportunities . 
Moreover , many fragile states are rich in natural resources , and must establish transparent resource management - aimed at curbing corruption and controlling illicit flows of money and goods - in order to raise the revenues needed to deliver services . 
A focus on these processes would ensure that fragile states take the lead and the responsibility . 
As partners , we must accept this national leadership . 
After Haiti &apos;s catastrophic earthquake in 2010 , the country was dubbed &quot; the republic of NGOs . &quot; 
Unable to create conditions in which Haitians themselves could take the lead in rebuilding their country , Haiti &apos;s external partners undermined the establishment of a functioning internal governance system . 
So , how can we translate our commitments and priorities into better lives for people who are affected by conflict and fragility ? 
OECD countries need to lead by example and meet the commitments that they have made . 
Our partners , through groupings like the g7 + , must continue to demand the changes in policies and practices that have been promised . 
We also must plan to change for the long term . 
As the Millennium Development Goals &quot; 2015 end date approaches , promotion of peace , security , and non-violent conflict resolution continues to be vitally important , and must be fully integrated into any future development agenda . 
Recently , the members of the International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding , the high-level political forum that produced the New Deal , met in Washington , DC , to assess our progress in changing how we work and in implementing the New Deal commitments . 
They agreed to the Washington Communiqu√© , which urges development partners , g7 + countries , and civil-society organizations to intensify their efforts to use the New Deal to deliver concrete results on the ground , and calls for a post-2015 development agenda that recognizes the universal importance of peace- and state-building . 
Ultimately , our progress depends on the resolve of everyone to transform the lives of the 1.5 billion people whose lives are marred by violence , conflict , and insecurity .
