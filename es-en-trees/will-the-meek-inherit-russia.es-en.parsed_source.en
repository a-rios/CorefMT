Will the Meek Inherit Russia ? 
MOSCOW - In a recent interview , Russia &apos;s President Dmitri Medvedev proclaimed that he wants a second term in office following the 2012 election , but that he would not run against Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who put him in power in the first place . 
Such a rivalry , Medvedev implied , would damage the country &apos;s well-being and image . 
Medvedev &apos;s statement should end speculation about whether he is running , yet it keeps the suspense alive regarding Putin , whose influence is far greater than that of Russia &apos;s meek president . 
Many , particularly in the West , would like to see Putin and his prickly , anti-Western authoritarianism pass from the scene . 
Indeed , over the last ten years , Russian foreign policy has been animated by defensiveness and suspicion . 
Russia even has uneasy relations with the congenitally non-threatening European Union . 
It is touchy about the independence of the near-abroad countries , especially those politically or geographically close to the West - Belarus , Moldova , Ukraine , and Georgia . 
More than a decade after the fact , the Kremlin still decries NATO &apos;s eastward enlargement as a security threat . 
The reality , of course , is that NATO is as much of an offensive threat to Russia as Switzerland is . 
But it is not NATO &apos;s military power that Putin &apos;s Kremlin finds alarming ; the real threat is the alliance &apos;s potential to &quot; swallow &quot; Moldova or Ukraine at some point . 
Creating a precedent for the democratization of post-Soviet space is a nightmare scenario for Putin and his cronies . 
As in Soviet times , the main task of today &apos;s ruling elite - Putin and his former KGB associates - is to preserve their tight-knit political and economic regime , built for their personal control and material benefit . 
Russian foreign policy is , as it was under the Soviets , an extension of official domestic priorities . 
The current regime is clearly autocratic . 
Yet it aspires to democratic legitimacy in the eyes of Russian citizens and the international community . 
It is to this end that Medvedev performs his civilizing mission - participating in world forums , posting Twitter updates , berating rampant corruption , and supporting &quot; modernization &quot; and the &quot; rule of law . &quot; 
The result of this duality - authoritarian establishment and Potemkin Village democratic fa√ßade - is that Russia occupies a unique geopolitical no man &apos;s land . 
A democratic Russia would want to catch up with the West and integrate into Western institutions . 
Yet this is not in the group interests of Putin &apos;s backers , the people who run , and own , Russia : its security , military , and industrial complex . 
Of course , these people have been personally integrated into Europe for two decades now - their money is in European banks ; their holiday villas are in the south of France , Tuscany , and the Greek isles ; their children are educated in the poshest boarding schools . 
So , despite the current regime &apos;s tough , often anti-Western rhetoric , they are not at all interested in closing Russia off from the West . 
What they want is to prevent the integration with the West of Russia itself , for that would mean the end of their regime . 
But , to sustain the charade of a strong and prosperous Russia , standing against the predations and hypocrisy of the West , the regime cannot be as authoritarian as Putin himself might wish . 
If it were , Swiss banks and international organizations would close their doors . 
So the regime &apos;s backers have a strong interest in maintaining its &quot; democratic &quot; side . 
The West , despite its years of experience in dealing with the Soviets , is still a sucker for such Janus-like behavior , especially now , when Medvedev presents such an endearing democratic face . 
In June , speaking at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum , Medvedev mesmerized his audience by simultaneously sounding avant-garde and hackneyed : he attacked corruption , vowed that Russia is not &quot; building state capitalism , &quot; and promised legal and federal reforms . 
Decisions , he said , should be left to business or made locally , not in the Kremlin . 
The St. Petersburg Economic Forum is mostly for international consumption . 
If Western bankers and investors want to buy snake oil , that is their business . 
But no one should leave such events thinking that anything Medvedev says means that Russia is changing . 
US Vice President Joe Biden , usually a sharp critic of Russia , arrived in Moscow in March , supposedly to convince Putin to surrender his presidential ambitions for 2012 . 
A month later , talking to Putin by phone , Biden invited him to visit Washington , though , according to Russia &apos;s constitution , the prime minister has no foreign-policy role . 
Does the United States support Putin in the elections , or , by recognizing Putin &apos;s historic importance , do the Americans mean to convince him to leave power ? 
No one knows . 
Until Russia &apos;s internal political situation changes , relations with the West will remain unchanged and ambiguous . 
Putin , however , would be well advised to listen to Biden , who is rumored to have offered him important international positions , such as chairing the International Olympic Committee , or perhaps even leading the United Nations . 
After all , Putin knows well the old Soviet playbook : the fate of previous KGB functionaries may await him . 
Dreaded secret-police chief Lavrenti Beria , who operated the machinery of repression under Joseph Stalin , was executed by the system he perfected , after being sentenced to death in 1953 for &quot; spying against the state . &quot; 
In his decade in power , Putin has consolidated and strengthened the security forces , intimidated and jailed opponents , and muzzled the media and courts . 
If he doesn &apos;t step down or aside so that Russia can move forward , the system he has created may turn his own methods against him .
