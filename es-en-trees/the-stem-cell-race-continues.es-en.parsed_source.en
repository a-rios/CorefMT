The Stem-Cell Race Continues 
Scientific research is usually conducted to improve our lives , but it is also an industry , one that represents a massive investment by governments and corporations alike . 
The stakes and potential rewards for a few research topics are exceptionally high , which is why the recent finding that the Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk fabricated the results of his work on stem cells has reverberated so widely . 
The episode highlights the ongoing race in global health research that is playing out in the field of stem cells . 
Possibly one of the biggest prizes in medical history is up for grabs , and anyone - truly anyone - could seize it . 
The last big scientific race of this type was the effort to map the human genome , which promises to alter future lives radically . 
That study was initiated by the United States , which used insights developed in the wake of the atomic bombing of Japan to understand the extent of long-term genetic damage . 
The current research effort on stem cells and their potential is just as grand , because it will lead to an equally radical medical revolution . 
A stem cell is special because it is able to reproduce a form that is different from itself . 
Whereas a skin cell or a liver cell , for instance , can reproduce only more skin or liver , stem cells , which are the most robust at the beginning of human development , are &quot; master &quot; cells . 
As a fertilized egg turns into an embryo , and then a fetus , those initial stem cells somehow show their daughter cells how to become skin , liver , eye , or bone . 
We need to know how this transformation is activated . 
Such knowledge would lead to huge , patentable advances . 
Most attention is focused on genetic diseases , such as Alzheimer &apos;s and Parkinson &apos;s , and to muscular dystrophy . 
In these cases , stem cells would be encouraged to restore nerve tissue . 
This would also benefit patients with brain and spinal injuries , or those who have suffered strokes and paralysis . 
There would be gains in parallel fields , too , such as gene therapy . 
A stem cell changes its identity through a process of &quot; triggering &quot; - a signal literally &quot; turns on &quot; the liver cell gene inside the stem version . 
When scientists figure out how to flip these switches , it might be possible to introduce stem cells into the body and activate them so that they correctly replace damaged tissue , whatever it is . 
Not surprisingly , given its huge potential , teams of scientists have been mobilized almost everywhere for embryonic stem cell research . 
The race has become all the more dramatic since the leading researcher , the US , dropped out , owing to the influence of religion on politics ( although the state of California has decided not to miss out , and recently approved a $ 3 billion subsidy for embryonic stem cell research ) . 
Because the promise is so great , and the science does not require massive infrastructure , many smaller countries have rushed to take advantage of the absence of the US . 
Any competent medical research center can enter the race , whether in Mexico , Ethiopia , Indonesia or Yemen . 
Whoever wins will have added the equivalent of a Saudi oil field to their economy . 
But , although anyone can win , science at this level is never a &quot; eureka &quot; event , with some single breakthrough suddenly ending the race . 
Discoveries occur incrementally , and , because it is science , each step is announced and tested . 
Research establishments gain momentum this way , with the leaders sweeping up talent , resources , and prestige in a rough-and-tumble intellectual ecology . 
Embedded in the larger race are many smaller ones , which jostle for early , impressive results . 
In May 2005 , Hwang &apos;s research center in Seoul reported the first major achievement . 
They claimed that they had developed a technique whereby new , perfect stem cells could be cloned from ordinary ones . 
This was big news , for it implied that sufficient numbers of stem cells could be made without controversy , thus allowing anyone to be able to do quality research while avoiding what US President George W. Bush described as &quot; taking a life to save a life . &quot; 
More importantly , the Koreans did a common thing these days : they claimed patent rights over the process . 
It almost looked for a moment as though South Korea would become a world superpower in health matters . 
We now know that the Seoul researchers made up the whole thing . 
An investigation by a Seoul National University investigative panel has concluded that the &quot; cloned &quot; stem cells were really created by test-tube fertilizations . 
The fraud has bewildered the science community , particularly because the claim that the Korean researchers made was so transparently false . 
Why , then , did they place their reputations and careers in jeopardy ? 
Medical research has always faced many challenges , even when the scientific quest was simply one of discovery . 
Now , the challenges are complicated by politics , market forces , and national interests . 
With stem cell research , huge fortunes depend on which group takes the lead , wherever their laboratory is located . 
As the competition heats up , we should expect amazing developments - and no doubt more public relations gimmicks .
