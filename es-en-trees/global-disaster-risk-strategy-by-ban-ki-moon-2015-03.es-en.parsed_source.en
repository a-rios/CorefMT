A Global Strategy for Disaster Risk 
SENDAI - Current disaster-risk levels are alarming . 
The cost of damage to commercial and residential buildings worldwide is averaging $ 314 billion each year , with the private sector bearing as much as 85 % of that price tag . 
At the same time , a new United Nations report shows that annual investments in disaster-risk reduction of $ 6 billion can result in savings of up to $ 360 billion . 
Hundreds of business executives , aware of the dramatic costs - and potential benefits - at stake , are now preparing to attend a UN conference on disaster-risk reduction in Sendai , Japan . 
A decade ago , when the last such gathering was held , the private sector was scarcely represented . 
This time , companies and entrepreneurs will be there in full force to explore a range of valuable opportunities . 
The Tohoku region of Japan , where the meeting will take place , is a vivid reminder of how a disaster &apos;s economic impact reverberates far beyond its epicenter . 
Devastated four years ago by the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami , Japan &apos;s automobile production was cut by nearly half . 
The financial damage did not stop at the country &apos;s borders ; as a direct result of the slowdown in Japan , automobile production dropped by some 20 % in Thailand , 50 % in China , and 70 % in India . 
The risks inherent in globalized production carry great rewards for those who know how to manage them properly . 
That is why major businesses such as PricewaterHouseCoopers , Hindustan Construction Corporation , AbzeSolar , Swiss Re , AECOM , AXA Group , IBM , and others - spanning many sectors and encompassing all regions - are engaging with UN experts to improve global strategies for disaster-risk management and reduction . 
This level of business engagement bodes well for pioneering a new planet-friendly and people-sensitive approach to global prosperity . 
Indeed , the disaster-risk reduction conference in Sendai is the first in a series of major international gatherings this year . 
Beyond Sendai , world leaders will convene in Addis Ababa in July to discuss financing for development , in New York in September to adopt a new development agenda , and in Paris in December to reach a meaningful climate-change agreement . 
Taken together , these meetings promise to generate transformative action that can set the world on a safer , more prosperous , and more sustainable path . 
Sustainability starts in Sendai for three major reasons . 
First , by its very nature , disaster-risk reduction requires forward planning . 
Second , investment in this area advances both sustainable development and climate action . 
And , third , helping those who are most vulnerable to disasters is the ideal starting point for the effort to aid all people by establishing universal targets for development and climate change . 
Over the last 12 months , thousands of lives were saved in India , the Philippines , and elsewhere by improved weather forecasting , early-warning systems , and evacuation plans . 
Advances in risk reduction that safeguard development gains and business investments must match this progress in disaster preparedness , and we must make wise choices that create greater opportunities in the future . 
For example , experts estimate that 60 % of the land that will be urbanized by 2030 has not yet been developed . 
Enterprises that factor disaster risk into their construction plans will avert the much higher costs of retrofitting later . 
More broadly , over the next 15 years , the world will make major investments in urban infrastructure , energy , and agriculture . 
If this spending is directed toward low-carbon goods , technologies , and services , we will be on our way to creating more resilient societies . 
More and more industries appreciate this . 
At the Climate Summit that I convened last September at the UN in New York , financial institutions , commercial and national banks , insurance companies , and pension funds vowed to mobilize more than $ 200 billion by the end of this year for action to address climate change . 
They envisioned a host of new initiatives , including issuing so-called green bonds and shifting assets to clean-energy portfolios . 
In a particularly important move , the insurance industry , representing $ 30 trillion in assets and investments , committed to creating a Climate Risk Investment Framework for industry-wide adoption by the end of the year . 
It is time to stop addressing development and humanitarian emergencies separately . 
Disaster-risk reduction lies at the nexus of development assistance , which seeks to advance better living conditions , and humanitarian aid , which begins after a disaster hits . 
Starting our international calendar with the Sendai meeting on disaster-risk reduction sends a clear signal that the world is ready to integrate its strategies . 
I have seen the human toll of disasters - from earthquakes in China and Haiti to floods in Pakistan and Bangladesh to Superstorm Sandy , which affected the Caribbean and North America , even inundating the lower floors of the UN facilities in New York . 
When business , civil society , and government team up to help countries withstand disasters , they save lives , boost stability , and create opportunities that enable markets and people alike to flourish . 
Sustainable profits . 
Sustainable livelihoods . 
Sustainable development . 
It all starts in Sendai .
