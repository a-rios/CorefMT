In Praise of Foxy Scholars 
PRINCETON - We live in a complicated world , so we are forced to simplify it . 
We categorize people around us as friends or foes , classify their motives as good or bad , and ascribe events with complex roots to straightforward causes . 
Such shortcuts help us navigate the complexities of our social existence . 
They help us form expectations about the consequences of our and others &quot; actions , and thereby facilitate decision-making . 
But , because such &quot; mental models &quot; are simplifications , they are necessarily wrong . 
They may serve us well as we navigate our daily challenges , but they leave out many details and can backfire when we find ourselves in an environment in which our categorizations and ready-made explanations fit less well . 
The term &quot; culture shock &quot; refers to situations in which our expectations about people &apos;s behavior turn out to be so wrong that we find ourselves jolted by the experience . 
And yet , without these shortcuts we would be either lost or paralyzed . 
We have neither the mental capacity nor the understanding to decipher the full web of cause-and-effect relations in our social existence . 
So our daily behavior and reactions must be based on incomplete , and occasionally misleading , mental models . 
The best that social science has to offer is in fact not much different . 
Social scientists - and economists in particular - analyze the world using simple conceptual frameworks that they call &quot; models . &quot; 
The virtue of such models is that they make explicit the chain of cause and effect , and therefore render transparent the specific assumptions on which a particular prediction rests . 
Good social science turns our unexamined intuitions into a map of causal arrows . 
Sometimes it shows how those intuitions lead to surprising , unanticipated results when extended to their logical conclusions . 
Fully general frameworks , such as economists &quot; beloved Arrow-Debreu model of general equilibrium , are so broad and encompassing that they are totally unhelpful for real-world explanation or prediction . 
Useful social-science models are invariably simplifications . 
They leave out many details to focus on the most relevant aspect of a specific context . 
Applied economists &quot; mathematical models are the most explicit example of this . 
But , whether formalized or not , simplified narratives are social scientists &quot; bread and butter . 
Stylized historical analogies often play a similar role . 
For example , international-relations scholars use the famous meeting between Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler in Munich in 1938 as a model of how appeasing a power bent on expansionism can be futile ( or dangerous ) . 
But , as inevitable as simplification is for explanation , it is also a trap . 
It is easy to get wedded to particular models and fail to recognize that changed circumstances require a different model . 
Like other humans , social scientists are prone to over-confidence in their preferred model of the day . 
They tend to exaggerate the support for the model and discount new evidence that contradicts it - a phenomenon known as &quot; confirmation bias . &quot; 
In a world of diverse and changing circumstances , social scientists can do real harm by applying the wrong model . 
Neoliberal economic policies , predicated on well-functioning markets , misfired in developing countries - just as planning models , presuming competent and capable bureaucrats , failed in an earlier era . 
The efficient-markets theory led policymakers astray by encouraging them to undertake excessive financial deregulation . 
It would be costly to apply the analogy of Munich in 1938 to a specific international conflict when the underlying situation is more reminiscent of Sarajevo in 1914 . 
So how should we choose among alternative simplifications of reality ? 
Rigorous empirical tests may eventually settle questions such as whether the US economy today is suffering more from Keynesian lack of demand or from policy uncertainty . 
Yet often we need to make decisions in real time , without the benefit of decisive empirical evidence . 
My research on growth diagnostics ( with Ricardo Hausmann , Andr√©s Velasco , and others ) is an example of this style of work , showing how one can identify in a specific context the more binding among a multitude of growth constraints . 
Unfortunately , economists and other social scientists get virtually no training in how to choose among alternative models . 
Neither is such an aptitude professionally rewarded . 
Developing new theories and empirical tests is regarded as science , while the exercise of good judgment is clearly a craft . 
The philosopher Isaiah Berlin famously distinguished between two styles of thinking , which he identified with the hedgehog and the fox . 
The hedgehog is captivated by a single big idea , which he applies unremittingly . 
The fox , by contrast , lacks a grand vision and holds many different views about the world - some of them even contradictory . 
We can always anticipate the hedgehog &apos;s take on a problem - just as we can predict that market fundamentalists will always prescribe freer markets , regardless of the nature of the economic problem . 
Foxes carry competing , possibly incompatible theories in their heads . 
They are not attached to a particular ideology and find it easier to think contextually . 
Scholars who are able to navigate from one explanatory framework to another as circumstances require are more likely to point us in the right direction . 
The world needs fewer hedgehogs and more foxes .
