Wasted Drugs and the Creation of Superbugs 
LONDON - This week , British Prime Minister David Cameron and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a new fund to support research aimed at tackling the problem of so-called superbugs : disease-causing microbes that have become resistant to conventional drugs . 
It was a hugely rewarding moment for me personally as the chair of an independent review that has been calling for the creation of an innovation fund to address antimicrobial resistance since February . 
More important , it is a major step toward a real solution to this global problem , one that demonstrates the vital role that emerging-economy scientific and commercial innovation can play , especially when China takes the lead . 
The announcement complements a meeting in Berlin earlier this month at which the health ministers of the G-7 countries - Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom , and the United States - sought solutions to the most pressing global health issues . 
One vital outcome was a shared commitment to tackle antimicrobial resistance , &quot; first , by improving infection prevention and control ; second , by conserving the effectiveness of existing and future antimicrobials ; and third , by engaging in research to optimize such approaches and to develop new antimicrobials , vaccines , treatment alternatives , and rapid diagnostic tools . &quot; 
These are the right objectives . 
Here , the greatest responsibility lies with the G-20 countries - and especially its emerging-economy members - which both suffer the most from drug-resistant infections and can do the most to solve the problem . 
To achieve the objectives identified by the G-7 , an especially promising target is drug wastage . 
By lowering the exposure of bacteria to drugs , we can slow the rise of drug resistance and keep our current medicines useful for longer , thereby reducing the urgency and cost of discovering new ones . 
As it stands , huge amounts of antibiotics are wasted each year - even in countries with highly sophisticated health-care systems . 
Indeed , in the US , 27 million courses of antibiotics are essentially wasted every year on patients who visit the doctor with respiratory complaints that do not actually merit the use of antimicrobial drugs . 
Such waste occurs largely because the vast majority of antibiotic prescriptions are made without the use of any diagnostic tool . 
Instead , doctors , often under pressure from uninformed patients , typically use so-called &quot; empirical &quot; diagnosis , applying their expertise , intuition , and professional judgment essentially to guess whether an infection is present , its likely cause , and the most appropriate treatment . 
In countries where patients can purchase antibiotics over the counter , the problem is even worse . 
Today , I published a set of three specific interventions to address this problem . 
As countries like Sweden and the Netherlands have already shown , it is possible to keep antibiotic use relatively low . 
Some progress has also been made in emerging economies , with China and Brazil reducing over-the-counter sales of antibiotics in large urban centers . 
But the goal should not be for the BRICS countries - Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa - to imitate advanced-country practices for prescribing antibiotics . 
Real progress over the next five years requires these countries &quot; health-care systems to leapfrog ahead of those of the advanced economies , by implementing rapid diagnostic technologies and tools wherever possible , thereby ensuring that antibiotics are used only when truly necessary . 
My first recommendation is to establish a global innovation fund to jumpstart research and development , by supporting world-class teams of researchers capable of delivering the best technical solutions . 
Given the stakes for the future of medicine , it is surprising that the world &apos;s leading innovators are not jumping into this field ( a notable exception is IBM Watson , which is considering relevant applications for its emerging &quot; artificial intelligence &quot; ) . 
Time will tell whether rapid diagnostic tests emerge from established companies like Apple or Google or from newcomers . 
My second recommendation is to tie incentives to the public-good aspect of diagnostics . 
Antibiotic use stands out in medicine as one of the few areas where the benefits of using diagnostic tools - in terms of reducing wastage and slowing the development of drug resistance - accrue to society over the long term . 
The problem is that , at the individual patient level , diagnostic tests can seem unnecessarily costly or time-consuming . 
I want to overcome this problem by creating &quot; diagnostic market stimulus &quot; pots . 
This would ensure that the developers of these new tests - often small companies - and the doctors who use them receive strong incentives that promote uptake and rewards that reflect the wider benefits of their use . 
Though the system may sound complicated , the successful implementation of comparable approaches in research and development of vaccines prove that it can be done . 
This system would not only spur innovation ; it would also help to increase uptake of new and existing diagnostics . 
The third intervention is to support the large , objective studies that are needed to prove a new product &apos;s clinical and cost effectiveness , thereby enabling technological adoption by health-care systems . 
Usually , the company developing the technology bears the costs of such studies , which can be prohibitively expensive for small companies . 
For health-care systems , however , they would amount to a sensible and affordable investment . 
If we are to defeat superbugs , we cannot continue to use 70-year-old technology and processes . 
At the same time , we cannot count on the prompt discovery of new and better antibiotics . 
And we certainly cannot rely on national solutions to what is clearly a global problem . 
Instead , patients , doctors , health ministries , and companies worldwide must work together to change the way we use antibiotics , especially by supporting and embracing transformational technology .
