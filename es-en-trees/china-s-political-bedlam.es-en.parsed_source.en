China \ u0027s Political Bedlam 
The last time China &apos;s President Jiang Zemin attended the Fortune Global Forum in Hong Kong , Time-Warner CEO Gerald Levin gave him an award named after Abraham Lincoln . 
President Jiang returned recently to that global gathering of business leaders but , thankfully , a repeat of that appeasement did not occur . 
Even Western bosses keen on China , it appears , are finding it hard nowadays to praise Jiang , as he crushes the Falun Gong spiritual movement by imprisoning or confining its members to psychiatric hospitals . 
Forced removal into mental hospitals of many Falun Gong members is central to this campaign . 
Overseas Falun Gong support groups have documented well over a hundred such cases . 
Estimates of the number being &quot; treated &quot; in this way run to 600 . 
Three of those sent to mental asylums are reported to have died as a result of their ill treatment . 
Little known to the outside world is China &apos;s gulag archipelago of Ankang ( &quot; Peace and Health &quot; ) institutions . 
The twenty-or-more institutions of this type are run by the Ministry of Public Security and are subordinate provincial departments . 
Political dissidents and others in similar categories brought before State forensic psychiatrists are often treated as the most &quot; serious and dangerous &quot; of all supposed mentally ill offenders , and face compulsory committal in these secretive institutions . 
Chinese forensic psychiatry has gone through several phases . 
In the 1950s , Soviet influences ( characterized by heretical clinical theories whereby particular forms of political and religious dissent were attributed to specific varieties of &quot; dangerous &quot; mental illness ) dominated . 
During the Cultural Revolution ( 1966 � 76 ) , when human psychology was officially repudiated and &quot; correct &quot; political ideology was equated with mental health , some 50 % to 70 % of psychiatric appraisals of criminal detainees in areas including Shanghai were categorized as &quot; political in nature . &quot; 
The 1980s saw a return to the more low � level psychiatric abuses of the pre � Cultural Revolution era . 
At first , the 1990s brought a decrease in politically directed psychiatry . 
In the wake of the Tiananmen massacre , however , individual dissidents and other political nonconformists were again committed to special psychiatric hospitals on an involuntary and indefinite basis . 
One example is Xue Jifeng , a labor � rights activist detained by police in Zhengzhou , the capital of Henan province , in December 1999 for attempting to meet with other labor activists . 
He was committed involuntarily to the Xinxiang Municipal Mental Hospital , where he remained until July 2000 . 
Another labor organizer , Cao Maobing , was committed more recently by police to a mental hospital in Jiangsu province . 
He was arrested after complaining to foreign reporters , and has since been administered medicine and forced to undergo electric shock therapy . 
A coterie of experts , says the hospital &apos;s director , found that Mr. Cao suffers from &quot; paranoid psychosis . &quot; 
Why resort to such elaborate and costly measures against political / religious opponents when simpler methods of neutralizing them - such as execution or imprisonment - are available to dictators ? 
One reason is that in post � Mao China , as in the Soviet Union after Stalin &apos;s death , physical liquidation of political enemies was ended by reformist leaders dedicated to curtailing past &quot; excesses . &quot; 
But because arrest no longer meant execution but long imprisonment , dissidents acquired a reasonable chance to emerge from prison or labor camps . 
As a result , networks of dissidents arose in both the USSR and China after the deaths of Stalin and Mao . 
The successors to those dictators , however , found this turn of events to be an unwanted complication in their political &quot; thaws &quot; ; more sophisticated mechanisms to induce fear among their peoples were needed , and there are few deterrents to dissident activity more potent than the threat of removal to an institution for the criminally insane . 
The outside world is not helpless in fighting against China &apos;s abuse of psychiatry . 
In 1983 , a protracted campaign by Western psychiatric professional bodies and international human rights organizations led the Soviet All � Union Society of Psychiatrists and Neuropathologists to withdraw from the World Psychiatric Association so as to avoid expulsion . 
It was not readmitted until 1989 , after years of perestroika and the opening of direct access to Western psychiatric delegations by Soviet forensic � psychiatric institutions . 
As a first step in this struggle , the World Psychiatric Association and national professional bodies should demand direct access to the Ankang network and other places of psychiatric incarceration . 
Advocacy by local and international psychiatric bodies may also encourage Western governments and the European Union to place the issue of political � psychiatric abuse on the formal agenda of the regular sessions devoted to human rights that are now a staple of Sino � Western relations .
