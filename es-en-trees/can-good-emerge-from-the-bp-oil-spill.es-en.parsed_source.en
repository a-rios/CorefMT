Can Good Emerge From the BP Oil Spill ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Perhaps it is a pipe dream , but it is just possible that the ongoing BP oil-spill catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico will finally catalyze support for an American environmental policy with teeth . 
Yes , the culprits should be punished , both to maintain citizens &quot; belief that justice prevails , and to make other oil producers think twice about taking outsized risks . 
Why should there be any reason for hope , especially given that US environmental policy has been predicated on the unrealistic belief that relatively small subsidies to new energy technologies can substitute for tax-induced price incentives for producers and consumers ? 
The fact is , the BP oil spill is on the cusp of becoming a political game-changer of historic proportions . 
If summer hurricanes push huge quantities of oil onto Florida &apos;s beaches and up the Eastern seaboard , the resulting political explosion will make the reaction to the financial crisis seem muted . 
Anger is especially rife among young people . 
Already stressed by extraordinarily high rates of unemployment , twenty-somethings are now awakening to the fact that their country &apos;s growth model - the one they are dreaming to be a part of - is , in fact , completely unsustainable , whatever their political leaders tell them . 
For now , it may only be black humor ( e.g. , the New Orleans waiter who asks diners whether they want their shrimp leaded or unleaded ) . 
But an explosion is coming . 
A carbon tax , long advocated by a broad spectrum of economists , is a generalized version of a gas tax that hits all forms of carbon emissions , including from coal and natural gas . 
In principle , one can create a &quot; cap-and-trade &quot; system of quantitative restrictions that accomplishes much the same thing - and this seems to be more palatable to politicians , who will jump through hoops to avoid using the word &quot; tax . &quot; 
But a carbon tax is far more transparent and potentially less prone to the pitfalls seen in international carbon-quota trading . 
A carbon tax can help preserve the atmosphere while also discouraging some of the most exotic and risky energy-exploration activities by making them unprofitable . 
Of course , there must be better ( far better ) and stricter regulation of offshore and out-of-bounds energy extraction , and severe penalties for mistakes . 
Advocating a carbon tax in response to the oil spill does not have to be just a way of exploiting tragedy in the Gulf to help finance outsized government spending . 
In principle , one could cut other taxes to offset the effects of a carbon tax , neutralizing the revenue effects . 
Why might a carbon tax be viable now , when it never has been before ? 
The point is that , when people can visualize a problem , they are far less able to discount or ignore it . 
Gradual global warming is hard enough to notice , much less get worked up about . 
Some say that young people in the rich countries are just too well off to mobilize politically , at least en masse . 
Indeed , there is volatility just beneath the surface . 
Modern-day record unemployment and extreme inequality may seem far less tolerable as young people realize that some of the most cherished &quot; free &quot; things in life - palatable weather , clean air , and nice beaches , for example - cannot be taken for granted . 
Of course , I may be far too optimistic in thinking that the tragedy in the Gulf will spur a more sensible energy policy that attempts to moderate consumption rather than constantly seeking new ways to fuel it . 
A great deal of the US political reaction has centered on demonizing BP and its leaders , rather than thinking of better ways to balance regulation and innovation . 
Politicians understandably want to deflect attention from their own misguided policies . 
A prolonged moratorium on offshore and other out-of-bounds energy exploration makes sense , but the real tragedy of the BP oil spill will be if the changes stop there . 
How many wake-up calls do we need ?
