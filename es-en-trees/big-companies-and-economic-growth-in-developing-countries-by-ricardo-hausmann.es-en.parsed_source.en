The Conglomerate Way to Growth 
CAMBRIDGE - Countries do not become rich by making more of the same thing . 
They do so by changing what they produce and how they produce it . 
They grow by doing things that are new to them ; in short , they innovate . 
Many countries have been altering their growth strategies to reflect this insight . 
But they are being distracted by some of the greatest - but atypical - examples of success . 
We all have heard of Steve Jobs , Bill Gates , and Mark Zuckerberg - twenty-something college dropouts who built billion-dollar companies at the cutting edge of global innovation . 
We have heard of the many start-ups that they and others acquired for hundreds of millions of dollars - Instagram , Skype , YouTube , Tumblr , and , most recently , Waze . 
So why not emulate these successes ? 
The main problem is that these examples are peculiar to the software industry , which provides a woefully insufficient blueprint for the rest of the economy . 
The software industry is unique , because it has unusually low barriers to entry and ready access to a huge market through the Internet . 
A start-up is typically just a group of kids with a good idea and programming skills . 
All they need is time to write the code . 
Incubators provide them with space , legal advice , and contacts with potential clients and investors . 
But consider a steel , automobile , or fertilizer plant - or a tourist resort , a hospital , or a bank . 
These are much more complex organizations that must start at a much larger scale , require much more upfront investment , and need to assemble a more heterogeneous team of skilled professionals . 
This is not something at which a young college dropout is bound to excel , because he lacks the experience , the organization , and the access to capital that these ventures require . 
And , compared to software development , these activities also require more infrastructure , logistics , regulation , certifications , supply chains , and a host of other business services - all of which demand coordination with public and private entities . 
Most important , these activities are most likely to be central to economic growth in developing and emerging countries . 
So , how will companies in these sectors arise , and what can be done to stimulate their formation ? 
Many developing-country governments are ignoring that question . 
For example , Chile &apos;s government , obsessed with so-called &quot; horizontal &quot; policies that do not tilt the playing field in favor of any industry , recently implemented Start-Up Chile , a program with standardized rules to encourage new ventures . 
Although the rules were designed for all industries , the scheme attracts almost exclusively software ventures - the only ones that can be formed with the low level of support that the program provides . 
Other industries face more daunting chicken-and-egg problems : countries lack the capabilities that growth industries demand , yet it is impossible to develop these capabilities unless the industries that require them are present . 
One way to solve this coordination problem is through vertical integration - that is , firms that can solve internally the coordination of the supply and demand for any new capability . 
That is why national business groups - conglomerates - often play a key role in transforming an economy and its exports . 
This is especially true in developing counties , where many markets are missing and the business environment is often extremely challenging . 
Conglomerates can use their knowledge , managerial skills , and financial capital to venture into new industries . 
They can start things at a scale that would be impossible for a start-up . 
They can make credible commitments to future suppliers and influence the business ecosystem to make new industries feasible . 
Consider South Korea . 
In 1963 , the country exported goods worth less than $ 600 million at today &apos;s prices , mostly primary products such as seafood and silk . 
Fifty years later , it exports goods worth almost $ 600 billion , mostly electronics , machinery , transportation equipment , and chemical products . 
This transformation was not achieved through independent start-ups . 
It was done through conglomerates , or chaebols in Korean . 
For example , Samsung started as a trading company , moved to food processing , textiles , insurance , and retail , and then on to electronics , shipbuilding , engineering , construction , and aerospace , just to name a few activities . 
South Korea &apos;s transformation was reflected in the transformation of its leading companies . 
But , in many developing countries , conglomerates have not played an equivalent role . 
They have focused on non-tradable goods and services - those that cannot be imported or exported - and have eschewed international competition . 
They have focused on banking , construction , distribution , retail , and television broadcasting . 
Once these companies dominate one market , they move to another that is equally sheltered from competition and devoid of export opportunities , often using their size and political influence to keep out would-be competitors . 
Instead of becoming agents of change , they often prevent change . 
( Indeed , the big economic debate in South Korea nowadays concerns whether the chaebols are stifling innovation by preventing start-up competitors from challenging them . ) 
The productive transformation that developing countries need is much easier to achieve with the support , rather than the obstruction , of their conglomerates . 
But ensuring such support requires policies that nudge ( or even shove ) conglomerates toward export industries that can grow beyond the limits of the domestic market - industries in which competition will encourage the discipline that they lack as a result of dominating local markets . 
To succeed , conglomerates need the support of government and the acceptance of society . 
They must earn it through their contribution to the growth of employment , exports , and tax revenues , and to the country &apos;s technological transformation . 
That is what General Park Chung-hee ( South Korea &apos;s longtime ruler , and father of current President Park Geun-hye ) pressured the chaebols to do in the early 1960 &quot; s . 
And it is what governments and civil societies in developing countries today should demand of their conglomerates .
