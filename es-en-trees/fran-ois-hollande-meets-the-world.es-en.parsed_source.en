François Hollande Meets the World 
PARIS - When François Hollande , fresh from his election as France &apos;s next president , was asked by a journalist which language he would use when he meets US President Barack Obama for the first time , his answer was revealing . 
&quot; I speak English more fluently than the former president , &quot; the Socialist leader insisted , referring to the outgoing Nicolas Sarkozy . 
&quot; But a French president must speak French ! &quot; 
In proclaiming his mastery of the lingua franca of global affairs , Hollande was asserting himself as a modern statesman , while also suggesting that France will remain as influential as possible on the international scene . 
Indeed , he was proclaiming his commitment to internationalism and multilateralism . 
In order to remain a country that punches above its weight diplomatically , it is in France &apos;s interest to operate through international organizations rather than to rely on bilateral relationships . 
Hollande is also aware that , for historical and cultural reasons , France &apos;s international role must be different from that of other countries . 
In his book Changer de destin ( Changing Destiny ) , published in February , he affirms that France &apos;s message will continue to be a universal one - a stance reminiscent of the birth in 1789 of the French Republic , which , like the United States , was originally conceived as the triumph of liberty and democracy . 
Unlike in France , however , the word &quot; socialist &quot; is an epithet for most Americans . 
But this could be a source of strength for Hollande , who , as a new leader with no foreign-policy experience , will have to prove his ability through action . 
And here , Obama , in particular , will soon understand that Hollande has no intention of bringing sweeping change . 
On the contrary , his intention will be to appear as a reliable and unsurprising partner . 
Hollande is unlikely to be less friendly with America than was Sarkozy , regarded by many as France &apos;s most pro-US president . 
Hollande supported the military intervention in Libya in 2011 , and has joined the condemnation of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime . 
One of his close political allies recently declared that should the United Nations Security Council approve military intervention in Syria , France &quot; could envision &quot; participating in that effort . 
Hollande also supports a tough line on Iran and , regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , his book indicates that he subscribes to the &quot; Clinton parameters &quot; - two states with secure borders and a status for Jerusalem that is acceptable to both sides . 
With regard to relations between France and the Arab world , one can be certain that Hollande would agree with the pro-engagement thrust of Obama &apos;s 2009 Cairo speech . 
Last but not least , Hollande is not likely to call into question Sarkozy &apos;s decision in 2009 to reintegrate France into NATO &apos;s military command . 
That decision remains controversial in France , including among Socialists , but Hollande is well aware of the weaknesses of a European defense policy that simply cannot compete with NATO . 
Nevertheless , at the NATO Summit in Chicago at the end of May , Hollande will confirm his pledge to withdraw French troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2012 , two years ahead of the NATO timetable ( though he recognizes the need to negotiate the practical details ) . 
This will be an important test of Hollande &apos;s ability to deal effectively with allies . 
The second test of his ability to negotiate with other leaders will be within Europe . 
One of the highest-flying proposals of his electoral platform was a call for renegotiation of the European Union &apos;s new &quot; fiscal pact , &quot; endorsed by all member states with the exception of the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic . 
Inspired by German Chancellor Angela Merkel , approval of the pact was a precondition for Germany &apos;s participation in the financial rescue plan for Greece and the other distressed eurozone countries . 
Hollande &apos;s proposal was initially regarded as lèse-majesté against Germany . 
Now all European leaders - from Mario Monti in Italy to Mariano Rajoy in Spain and Elio Di Rupo in Belgium - agree on the need to revive the European economy . 
So do Mario Draghi , the president of the European Central Bank , Jose Manuel Barroso , the president of the European Commission , EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy , and , indeed , Merkel herself . 
Merkel and Hollande will discuss the main question - how to spur economic growth without increasing public debt - on May 15 in Berlin . 
While Merkel opposes Hollande &apos;s proposal to create Eurobonds with a view to financing industrial projects , they cannot afford to waste time in reassuring jittery markets with a message of cohesion . 
Merkel has already welcomed Hollande &apos;s ideas for a growth plan for Europe . 
Hollande , too , will have to make concessions . 
For the French , as for all Europeans , the EU is not a foreign entity , and its decisions are an integral part of domestic policies . 
In this regard , Hollande has a chance to succeed on the international scene as a truly pro-European leader . 
Only a stronger Europe will ensure fair trade with emerging countries , especially China . 
Only a stronger Europe will at last implement the principle of reciprocity in order to protect European businesses and prevent them from relocating , which has been the main cause of unemployment . 
In a recent interview , Hollande declared that , &quot; France is not just any European country , and its president is not just any world leader . &quot; 
The French are happy to hear that . 
But that affirmation also represents Hollande &apos;s main challenge : ensuring that this remains true in the context of twenty-first-century globalization .
