Mexico &apos;s War of Choice 
MEXICO CITY - Three years ago this month , Mexican President Felipe Calderón donned military fatigues and declared a full-scale war on drugs , ordering the Army into Mexico &apos;s streets , highways , and villages . 
Back then , Calderón received broad support , both domestically and from abroad , for what was viewed as a brave , overdue , and necessary decision . 
Tangible results were predicted to come soon . 
Moreover , George W. Bush &apos;s administration quickly promised American support - the so-called Mérida Initiative , signed in February , 2007 - and public-opinion polls showed that Calderón had , in one fell swoop , left behind the travails of his close and questioned electoral victory , gaining the trust of the Mexican people . 
But today , things look very different . 
At a recent debate with , among others , Fareed Zakaria of Newsweek and CNN , Asa Hutchison , the former head of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency , the main question was whether the US was to blame for Mexico &apos;s drug war . 
I pointed out that neither the US nor Mexico was to blame ; only Calderón was . 
Just like Bush &apos;s invasion of Iraq , Mexico &apos;s drug war was a war of choice . 
It was a war that Calderón should not have declared , that cannot be won , and that is doing enormous damage to Mexico . 
Today , a growing number of Mexicans shares this view . 
As the war drags on , positive results are nowhere to be seen , while violence in the country is escalating . 
On December 9 , for example , according to the daily newspaper Reforma , 40 people died in firefights between police and army forces and the drug cartels . 
More than 6,500 fatalities will have occurred this year alone , topping last year &apos;s total , which was double that in 2007 . 
I believe that Calderón declared this war because he felt the need to legitimize himself before Mexico &apos;s people , given the doubts surrounding his victory in the 2006 presidential election - doubts that his supporters , like me , never shared . 
And I believe that it is unwinnable because it fails to comply with the tenets of the Powell Doctrine , elaborated 18 years ago by Colin Powell , then Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , in relation to the first Gulf War . 
Powell enumerated four conditions that must be satisfied in order to succeed in a military operation . 
One was deployment of overwhelming force , which the Mexican military lacks . 
Another was definable victory , which one never has in a war on drugs ( a term first used by Richard Nixon in the late 1960 &quot; s ) . 
The third condition was an exit strategy at the outset , which Calderón lacks , because he can neither withdraw in defeat in his own country , nor withdraw and declare victory . 
Calderón still does enjoy the support of the public - Powell &apos;s fourth condition - but he is beginning to lose it . 
Over the past three years , more than 15,000 Mexicans have died in the drug war . 
Human Rights Watch , Amnesty International , and the United Nations Human Rights Council Universal Peer Review have all documented , with more or less evidence and precision , a proliferation of abuses and an absence of accountability for them . 
Of the more than 220,000 people arrested on drug charges since Calderón took office , three-quarters have been released . 
Only 5 % of the remaining 60,000 or so have been tried and sentenced . 
Meanwhile , acreage used for poppy and marijuana production has risen , according to the US government , to 6,900 and 8,900 hectares , respectively . 
Restrictions on the transshipment of cocaine from South America to the US have made only a dent in street prices , which spiked in 2008 but have stabilized in 2009 at levels well below their historical highs in the 1990 &quot; s . 
According to the US government &apos;s International Narcotics Control Strategy Report ( INCSR ) , opium , heroin , and marijuana seizures have decreased since Calderón began his drug war , and drug production in Mexico is on the rise . In 2008 , according to the US State Department , potential heroin production reached 18 metric tons , up from 13 metric tons in 2006 , as production of opium gum rose to 149 metric tons , from 110 metric tons . 
Cannabis production grew by 300 metric tons over this period , to 15,800 metric tons . 
In other words , since Calderón began his war on drugs , more Mexican drugs are on the market , not less . 
There is no easy way out of this quagmire . 
The National Police Force that Mexico &apos;s last three presidents - Ernesto Zedillo , Vicente Fox and Calderón - have tried to build is still far from ready to replace the Army in drug-enforcement tasks . 
American assistance , as a US General Accounting Office report made clear in early December , is barely trickling in . 
Indeed , by some accounts , only 2 % of the projected $ 1.3 billion in aid has been disbursed . 
Perhaps the least bad solution would be to proceed by default : gradually allow the drug war to vanish from television screens and newspapers , and have its place taken by other wars : on poverty , on petty crime , and for economic growth . 
This may not be ideal , but it is better than prolonging a fight that cannot be won .
