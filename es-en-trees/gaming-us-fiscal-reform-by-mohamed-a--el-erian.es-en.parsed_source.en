Gaming US Fiscal Reform 
NEWPORT BEACH - It sounded like a really clever idea : Use a very public and sizeable threat to get bickering politicians to collaborate and compromise . 
Well , it has not worked so far , and the already-sizeable stakes just got bigger . 
No , I am not talking here about Europe &apos;s debt crisis , decisive resolution of which still requires greater cooperation and shared responsibility , both within individual eurozone member states and between creditor and debtor countries . 
I am referring to the complex fiscal situation in the United States - a fluid problem that has just been rendered more consequential by the recent warning from the ratings agency Moody &apos;s that the US could lose its top credit rating next year if Congress fails to make progress on medium-term fiscal reforms . 
Hobbled by the self-inflicted wounds of the debt-ceiling debacle in the summer of 2011 - which undermined economic growth and job creation , and further damaged Americans &quot; confidence in their political system - the US Congress and President Barack Obama &apos;s administration recognized the need for a measured and rational approach to fiscal reform . 
To increase the likelihood of this , they agreed on immediate spending cuts and tax increases that would automatically kick in ( the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; ) if agreement on a comprehensive set of fiscal reforms eluded them . 
On paper , at least , this sizeable threat - involving blunt fiscal contraction amounting to some 4 % of GDP - should have properly aligned incentives in Washington , DC . 
After all , no politician would wish to go down in history as being responsible for pushing the country back into recession at a time when unemployment is already too high , income and wealth inequalities are increasing , and a record number of Americans live in relative poverty . 
Yet , so far , the threat has not worked . 
To understand why , we can appeal to game theory , which provides economists and others a powerful framework with which to explain the dynamics of both simple and complex interactions . 
The objective of threatening a fiscal cliff was to force a &quot; cooperative outcome &quot; on an increasingly &quot; non-cooperative game . &quot; 
But , in the absence of a credible enforcer ( and lacking sufficient mutual assurances ) , participants felt that they had more to gain from continuing their non-cooperative behavior . 
Politicians on both sides of America &apos;s political divide have generally felt that compromise would be viewed as a sign of weakness . 
Moreover , too many have made prior commitments - for example , promising never to increase taxes - that they find hard to break , especially ahead of elections that both sides deem to be of defining significance for the country &apos;s future , reflected in the candidates &quot; campaigns , which are getting nastier by the day . 
The cost-benefit calculations will likely evolve after the election in November . 
At that point , the cost of being singled out as collaborating with members of the other side - and thus the risk of being unseated by more extreme forces in one &apos;s party - may well decline . 
Moreover , since early September , the potential benefits of cooperation now include avoiding an embarrassing credit-rating downgrade next year if medium-term fiscal reform does not materialize . 
I suspect that some will be quick to dismiss the consequences of a Moody &apos;s downgrade . 
And it certainly is tempting to do so . 
After all , the global financial crisis badly damaged the credibility of ratings agencies as a whole . 
Moreover , one would be hard pressed to identify any meaningful hit to the US from the decision by another major agency , Standard 
Poor &apos;s , to downgrade America &apos;s sovereign rating in August 2011 . 
On the contrary , rather than spiking higher following S P &apos;s unprecedented move , US market interest rates continued to fall , reaching record-low levels . 
This seemingly contradictory fall in financing costs reflected an abundance of foreign capital seeking to invest in the US , including money fleeing from Europe . 
The absence of any adverse impact on government finances may thus lead some to dismiss the impact of a potential Moody &apos;s downgrade in 2013 . 
Yet , those of us who are exposed on a daily basis to the inner workings of financial markets would caution against too upbeat an attitude toward a second downgrade by a major ratings agency . 
Moreover , the potential impact certainly is not linear . 
Owing to the way that investment contracts are written and guidelines specified , there is a meaningful difference between a single and multiple rating downgrades . 
Were Moody &apos;s to follow S P in stripping the US of its triple-A rating , the most likely outcome is that the universe of global investors who are both able and willing to increase their holdings of US government securities would shrink over time . 
Fortunately for the US , the immediate adverse impact on borrowing costs would be alleviated , if not nullified , by investors &quot; lack of readily available alternatives to US government bonds , as well as a Federal Reserve that has been buying large volumes of US Treasuries . 
But this is not a long-term risk worth taking . 
Historically , it has taken countries many years of difficult fiscal-policy efforts to regain a triple-A status . 
All of this suggests that , whether in the lame-duck congressional session following the elections or in the first few months of the new Congress , US politicians will likely dismantle the fiscal cliff . 
Based on an assessment of potential commonality among the political parties , such a compromise would limit the contractionary fiscal impact to some 1.5 % of GDP . 
Such a mini-bargain would go a long way toward reducing the risk of a serious US recession . 
But it would fall short of the type of fiscal reforms that would satisfy Moody &apos;s . 
Such reforms require a grand bargain between America &apos;s political parties , which in turn presupposes visionary leadership by both of them .
