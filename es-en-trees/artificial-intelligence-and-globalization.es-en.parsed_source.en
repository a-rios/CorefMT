Artificial Intelligence and Globalization 
Today &apos;s conventional wisdom is that the rise of India and China will be the single biggest factor driving global jobs and wages over the twenty-first century . 
High-wage workers in rich countries can expect to see their competitive advantage steadily eroded by competition from capable and fiercely hard-working competitors in Asia , Latin America , and maybe even some day Africa . 
This is a good story , full of human drama and power politics . 
But I wonder whether , even within the next few decades , another factor will influence our work lives even more : the exponential rise of applications of artificial intelligence . 
My portal to the world of artificial intelligence is a narrow one : the more than 500-year-old game of chess . 
You may not care a whit about chess , long regarded as the ultimate intellectual sport . 
But the stunning developments coming out of the chess world during the past decade should still command your attention . 
Chess has long been the centerpiece of research in artificial intelligence . 
While in principle , chess is solvable , the game &apos;s computational complexity is almost incomprehensible . 
It is only a slight exaggeration to say there are more possible moves in a chess game than atoms in a universe . 
For most of the twentieth century , programmers were patently unsuccessful in designing chess computers that could compete with the best humans . 
A human chess master &apos;s ability to intuit , visualize , and prioritize easily prevailed over the brute force approach of computers . 
The computers gradually improved , but they still seemed far inferior to the top humans . 
Or so we thought . 
Then , in 1997 , in what will surely long be remembered as a historical milestone for modern man , IBM &apos;s &quot; Deep Blue &quot; computer stunned the world by defeating the world champion Garry Kasparov . 
Proud Kasparov , who was perhaps more stunned than anyone , was sure that the IBM team must have cheated . 
He sarcastically told reporters that he sensed the &quot; the hand of God &quot; guiding his silicon opponent . 
But the IBM team had not cheated . 
Rather , through a combination of ingenious software and massive parallel computing power , they had produced a silicon-based entity capable of such finesse and subtlety , that international chess grandmasters worldwide ( including me ) were simply amazed . 
Since 1997 , the computers have only gotten better , to the point where computer programmers no longer find beating humans a great challenge . 
Only a game , you say ? 
Perhaps , but let me tell you this : when I played professional chess 30 years ago ( I once represented the United States in the World Chess Championship cycle ) , I felt I could tell a lot about someone &apos;s personality by seeing a sampling of their games , even those of an amateur . 
Until a short while ago , I could certainly distinguish a computer from a human opponent . 
Now everything changed like lightning . 
The machines can now even be set to imitate famous human players - including their flaws - so well that only an expert eye ( and sometimes only another computer ! ) can tell the difference . 
More than half a century ago , the godfather of artificial intelligence , Alan Turing , argued that the brain &apos;s function could all be reduced to mathematics and that , someday , a computer would rival human intelligence . 
He claimed that the ultimate proof of artificial intelligence would be met if a human interrogator were unable to figure out that he was conversing with a computer . 
The &quot; Turing test &quot; is the holy grail of artificial intelligence research . 
Well , for me , a chess game is a conversation of sorts . 
From my perspective , today &apos;s off-the-shelf computer programs come awfully close to meeting Turing &apos;s test . 
Over the course of a small number of games on the Internet , I could not easily tell the difference . 
True , today &apos;s computers have not evolved to the level of the deranged chess-playing HAL in the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick &apos;s masterpiece &quot; 2001 : A Space Odyssey , &quot; much less Arnold Schwarzenegger-like droids from the Terminator movies . 
But the level that computers have reached already is scary enough . 
What &apos;s next ? 
I certainly don &apos;t feel safe as an economics professor ! 
I have no doubt that sometime later this century , one will be able to buy pocket professors - perhaps with holographic images - as easily as one can buy a pocket Kasparov chess computer today . 
So let &apos;s go back to India and China . 
Globalization proceeded at a rapid pace through much of the last century , and at a particularly accelerated rate during its last two decades . 
Yet the vast body of evidence suggests that technological changes were a much bigger driver in global wage patterns than trade . 
That is , technology , not trade , was the big story of the twentieth-century economy ( of course , the two interact , with trade helping to diffuse and stimulate technology , but this is a matter of semantics . ) 
Are we so sure that it will be different in this century ? 
Or will artificial intelligence replace the mantra of outsourcing and manufacturing migration ? 
Chess players already know the answer .
