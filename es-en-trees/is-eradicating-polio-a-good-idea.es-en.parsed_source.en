Is Eradicating Polio a Good Idea ? 
PHILADELPHIA - Polio broke out in Central Asia this year , with 560 cases reported in Tajikistan . 
Cases have also been diagnosed in Russia and Uzbekistan , apparently transmitted by infected but asymptomatic people traveling from Tajikistan . 
The Tajikistan outbreak is especially troubling , because the country had been certified by the World Health Organization as polio-free . 
Indeed , the drive to eradicate polio , as the Tajikistan tragedy shows , may be putting the entire world at risk . 
It makes no sense to talk about eradicating diseases like polio if a small outbreak in a remote part of the globe can rapidly spread and imperil billions . 
That scenario is not merely hypothetical . 
The Western Hemisphere was certified as polio-free 20 years ago , but there were cases in Haiti and the Dominican Republic as recently as 2000 . 
Four cases were reported in an Amish community in Minnesota in 2005 , and many others have been reported in recent years in Angola , Nigeria , Uganda , Kenya , Benin , India , Nigeria , Somalia , Pakistan , Sudan , and elsewhere . 
For many in the field of public health , the greatest triumph achieved by medicine in this century was the eradication of smallpox . 
This astounding accomplishment has played a key role in leading various national and international governments and organizations , including the WHO , Rotary International , and the Gates Foundation , to mount efforts to eradicate many other infectious diseases , such as measles , malaria , and polio . 
Eradicating diseases that have killed or disabled untold numbers of people is a goal that is easy to understand and support . 
As WHO Director Margaret Chan told an audience of Rotarians at the group &apos;s international convention last year , &quot; The international community has so very few opportunities to improve this world in genuine and lasting ways . 
Polio eradication is one . &quot; 
Moreover , talk of disease &quot; eradication &quot; is unparalleled as a means to command funding , engage the attention of politicians , and garner positive media coverage . 
But there are reasons to wonder whether continued efforts at polio eradication - as opposed to aggressive and effective disease management and control - is the right course to follow . 
If polio eradication is the goal for current public-heath campaigns , it is important to recognize exactly what target is being set . 
Talk of eradication means permanent relief from a disease , and thus permission to let down our guard against it . 
But the consequences of replacing vigilance with indifference regarding polio are too risky in today &apos;s world . 
For starters , the surveillance required to establish eradication is a huge challenge . 
Political instability , wars and civil breakdown , and balky governments sometimes make access nearly impossible in some parts of the world . 
Moreover , it is not clear that all polio cases can be detected , because some infected people do not show symptoms . 
And the challenge of ensuring adequate surveillance appears insurmountable when one considers that polio can suddenly reappear out of the blue in a so-called wild-type form . 
Chasing down the last cases of polio is very costly . 
Fragile health-care infrastructure and community support are being strained by the eradication effort , as government budgets and resources in poor countries are diverted from more pressing local problems . 
In other parts of the world , the emergence of respect for a patient &apos;s right to refuse vaccines creates a difficult challenge for those seeking to eradicate diseases such as polio . 
Vaccination rates in many parts of the United States have fallen well below 90 % for polio , meaning that the risk of an outbreak is very high should a case be introduced . 
And , in an age of mass air travel , a case in Tajikistan can be in Utah in a day . 
Finally , there is the ever-present possibility of bioterrorism . 
For this reason alone , no trust should be placed in claims of eradication of diseases like polio . 
Of course , the eradication of polio is a noble goal . 
But it is not the right one . 
The best that can be done is to seek to control polio , and to hope that politics , economics , and ethics allow us to get that far . Those involved in efforts aimed at complete eradication should rethink their goal , lest faith in the unattainable leads to disaster .
