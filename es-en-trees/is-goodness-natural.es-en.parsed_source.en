Is Goodness Natural ? 
It is hard to imagine that anyone thinks of goodness as a problem , but Charles Darwin did . 
The little worker bees that sacrificed themselves to protect their hives - the ultimate example of animal goodness - kept Darwin up at night . 
Given Darwin &apos;s ideas about evolution natural selection were correct ( and , of course , they were and are ) , then this sort of altruism should be extraordinarily rare in nature . 
If increased reproduction is the ultimate end all and be all of evolution by natural selection , then altruists should disappear - and fast . 
But they don &apos;t disappear , and Darwin was so puzzled by this that he spoke of altruism as a problem that could prove fatal to his whole theory of evolution . 
Then a solution to this nasty conundrum hit Darwin like a ton of bricks . 
Worker bees weren &apos;t helping just any old bunch of bees ; they were protecting their hive . 
And their hive contained special individuals : blood relatives . 
Blood relatives are , by definition , very similar to one another . 
So even though the little worker bees may have been giving up their lives , by doing so they were potentially saving hundreds of blood relatives . 
In modern parlance , we &apos;d say that the worker bees were helping blood kin , because blood kin are genetically related . 
By helping your blood relatives , you are indirectly promoting the reproduction of copies of your own genes - copies that just happen to reside inside your kin . 
Darwin wasn &apos;t the only scientist who was fascinated with the question of the evolution of goodness . 
In fact , his good friend and colleague , Thomas Henry Huxley , was as well . 
Huxley , in fact , got himself into quite a heated argument over whether blood kinship could or could not explain altruism . 
Huxley &apos;s opponent was Prince Peter Kropotkin , ex-page to the Czar of Russia , naturalist , and arguably the most famous anarchist of the nineteenth century . 
Huxley argued that all goodness could be traced to blood kinship , while Kropotkin argued that goodness and blood kinship were completely divorced from one another - one had nothing to do with the each other . 
Of course , neither was right , but it would take almost a hundred years before a shy , reserved , and brilliant British biologist named William D. Hamilton would settle all the arguments about blood kinship and altruism by coming up with a simple , but elegant mathematical equation . 
Instead of asking if blood kinship explains everything or nothing about altruism , Hamilton approached the question differently . 
He began by defining three terms : the genetic relatedness between individuals ( labeled r ) , the cost of an act of goodness ( c ) , and the benefit that a recipient obtained when someone was nice to him or her ( b ) . 
Using some beautiful mathematics , in the early 1960 &quot; s Hamilton discovered that altruism and blood kinship are not linked by an all- or- nothing relationship . 
Instead , what is now known as &quot; Hamilton &apos;s Rule &quot; states that altruism evolves whenever r times b is greater than c . 
In other words , if enough relatives receive benefits from altruism to outweigh the cost of altruism , then altruism spreads ; otherwise , it does not . 
Phrased in the cold language of natural selection , blood relatives are worth helping in direct proportion to their genetic ( blood ) relatedness , weighted by how great a benefit they received . 
Literally thousands of experiments with both nonhumans and humans show the power of Hamilton &apos;s Rule . 
This little equation is evolutionary biology &apos;s version of e = mc2 . 
Over and over , we see that an analysis of the costs and benefits of altruism , along with the genetic relatedness of interactants , allows us to predict the presence or absence of altruism . 
Hamilton &apos;s Rule , of course , does not explain all altruism . 
Another large chunk of goodness falls under the category of &quot; reciprocity . &quot; 
Individuals are sometimes willing to be altruistic to someone now in the expectation that they will , in turn , be helped when we they need it . 
Evolutionary biologists have been almost as interested in this type of altruism , as they have been in kinship-based altruism . 
Amazingly enough , it was Bill Hamilton , along with the political scientist Robert Axelrod and the evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers , who formalized the models behind the evolution of reciprocity . 
Following up on work done by Trivers in the early 1970 &quot; s , in 1981 , Axelrod and Hamilton used the mathematics of game theory to predict when so-called &quot; reciprocal altruism &quot; should evolve . 
Again , scores of empirical studies have followed up the model . 
Reciprocity can be complex , but an evolutionary perspective has cleared the path to understanding , just the same way it did in the case of blood kinship and altruism . 
If goodness is a problem , then the answer - or at the least part of the answer - can be found in evolutionary biology .
