Israel at Sixty 
Tel Aviv - Ten years ago , on Israel &apos;s 50th anniversary , the peace process begun by the path-breaking Oslo accord , reached by Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 1993 , established the legitimacy of two peoples &quot; national existence in their shared homeland on the basis of territorial compromise . 
There was a general feeling that this long conflict was being resolved . 
Unfortunately , the past ten years have witnessed a painful setback in many areas . 
Individuals and peoples are capable of enduring difficulties if there is a sense that the future will be better and conflicts resolved . 
But a sudden backward regression can lead to despair , which we feel today . 
Why is it that struggles far more complex than the Israel-Arab conflict - apartheid in South Africa , the partition of Germany , or the collapse of the Soviet Union - all seem to have been resolved , usually without bloodshed , whereas the Middle East conflict , after more than a century , claims more victims every day ? 
One reason is that this conflict is unparalleled in human history . 
There is no other example of a nation that returned after a 2,000-year absence to a territory that it never stopped regarding as its homeland . 
So it is no wonder that the Arabs , especially the Palestinians , remain unable to comprehend , existentially or morally , what has befallen them . 
The Jews &quot; return to Israel was not colonialism , as the Arabs thought . 
Not only did the Jews lack a mother country , but in Europe they lived as a foreign nation , leading to expulsion and annihilation . 
The Jews did not come to exploit Palestine &apos;s resources or subjugate its residents in order to transfer the economic benefits elsewhere . 
Nor did they come like the American or Australian settlers in order to build a new identity and assimilate the natives into it . 
Zionism aimed at renewing and deepening an old identity . 
From the beginning , there was no intention to damage the identity of the native-born Arabs , or to merge it with the traditional Jewish identity . 
Because the Arabs had no corresponding historical model from which to learn how to relate to the phenomenon that had overtaken them , they tried to interpret Zionism as colonialism , and thought that other nations &quot; fight against colonialism provided a model for resistance . 
Thus , the legitimacy of Israel &apos;s right to exist remains an open question . 
Indeed , never before has the question of legitimacy been so fundamental to a conflict between nations . 
Although recognition of Israeli nationality is increasingly widespread , even among most nations of the Middle East , it remains obstructed by two closely related - and dangerous - notions . 
The first is the growing shift in the Middle East , and elsewhere , from rejection of Israel &apos;s legitimacy to rejection of Zionism &apos;s legitimacy . 
The second is the growing tendency among Palestinians , other Arabs , and many Europeans to prefer a bi-national Israeli-Palestinian state to the original two-state solution . 
Hamas spokesmen speak not of &quot; Israelis &quot; but of &quot; Zionists , &quot; as does Iran &apos;s President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad . 
Discussion about the &quot; de-Zionization &quot; of Israel can also be heard at universities worldwide and even among Jewish leftists . 
In Israel , too , there are people , though not many , who call themselves &quot; post-Zionist &quot; or &quot; non-Zionist . &quot; 
But the sole practical expression of Zionism nowadays is the Law of Return , which is not a racist law but a moral law . 
When the world &apos;s nations decided in favor of the creation of an independent Jewish state , they did not designate it only for the 600,000 Jews then living there . 
Rather , they intended that Israel would help solve the Jewish problem everywhere in the world by enabling every Jew who wished to leave the diaspora to do so . 
The idea of a bi-national Israeli-Palestinian state embodies the dangerous illusion that two peoples who are utterly different in their language , religion , culture , and history , who are divided by a deep economic chasm and connected to their own external worlds - the Palestinians to the Arab world and Israelis to the rest of world Jewry - can be combined in the framework of a single state . 
Moreover , these are two peoples that have been intensely engaged in a bloody and intractable conflict for the last century . 
Both Palestinians and Israelis , as two different nations , deserve their own states . 
There must be a clear border between the two . 
In Israel , an Israeli Arab-Palestinian minority has full citizenship , even if much remains to be done to afford it full social and economic equality . 
It is possible that in the Palestinian state there would be a small Jewish minority , consisting of West Bank settlers whose attachment to the Biblical homeland is so intense that they would be willing to live under Palestinian control - provided that the Palestinians would grant them Palestinian citizenship . 
During the early years of Zionism , the great Jewish scholar Gershom Scholem - who was born in Berlin - said that the Jews were embarking on a difficult journey , a return to history . 
In other words , the Jews , who based their identity in the diaspora on mythological memory and time , were now returning to its clear-cut elements : a territory defined by borders , and a detailed chronological understanding of their own history . 
Sixty years later , the Arab-Israeli conflict reminds us that the Jews &quot; journey back to history continues .
