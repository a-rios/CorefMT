The EU \ u0027s Next Priority After Enlargement ? 
Le défi Americain 
The European Union summit that just ended in Copenhagen has more or less settled the EU &apos;s future frontiers . 
Ten new members , from Central Europe and the Mediterranean , will be admitted in 2004 . 
Two other countries , Bulgaria and Romania , can aim for membership three years after that . 
Turkey , after much huffing and puffing , has had its status as an officially recognized candidate for membership reaffirmed , even if mighty doubts remain as to when it will actually join . 
Because this enlargement round is likely to be the last for a long time , if not forever , it is urgent for member states to think seriously about re-writing the EU treaties to deal with the new reality , in terms which will be workable for the long term . 
In particular , member states will need to think much more radically about developing a strong EU foreign and security policy , for two reasons . 
First , enlargement will take the EU right up to the frontier of Russia and the former Soviet Union ; if Turkey joins , the EU will extend to the heart of the Middle East as well . 
Second , the international context in which the EU operates is being transformed by the strategic revolution underway in Washington . 
For the past 50 years , the EU was largely able to count on a benign partnership with the US in a multilateral context ; that assumption no longer holds , even if we do not yet know the extent of America &apos;s new unilateralism . 
The problem is aggravated by the fact that the EU remains wholly unprepared for its &quot; big bang &quot; enlargement , even as it is set to begin . 
No one has any idea how to run a Union of 25 or more member states - not even in terms of basic logistics , starting with the geometric escalation in translation requirements . 
Or consider the laboriousness of conducting negotiations in a room with 25 national delegations , 10 of whom will be unfamiliar with the way the EU works . 
But the enlargement schedule agreed at Copenhagen will define the final limit of the Union . 
Norway may one day possibly seek to join , and that would pose no problems ; it is conceivable that Switzerland may seek to join , and that too would not be a problem ( except to the Swiss ) . 
Otherwise , it is difficult to imagine further EU enlargement . 
Aside from the poor , war-ravaged Balkan states - Albania , Bosnia , Croatia , Macedonia , and whatever Serbia and Montenegro end up deciding to call themselves - the only imaginable additional candidates , assuming that they are classified as &quot; European , &quot; are Russia , Belarus and Ukraine . 
The key country here is Russia . 
Leaving aside all questions of human rights , democracy , and the rule of law , Russia is just too big , too Asiatic , too nuclear , and too much of a &quot; great power , &quot; to be accommodated inside the EU . 
In theory , the advantage of this &quot; big bang &quot; enlargement is that it may concentrate minds on the need for a radical re-think of the decision-making processes in a bigger EU . 
Past enlargements have been in packets of one , two , or at most three new members . 
On these occasions existing members pretended that they need not fundamentally change the EU &apos;s institutional arrangements . 
With 10 new members joining , that pretence is no longer tenable . 
Fortunately , the ground is being prepared for reform by the Convention on the future of the Union being chaired by former French President Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , which should make its institutional proposals next spring . 
The trouble is that the steep escalation of enlargement coincides with a swing of opinion in a number of member countries in favor of a more intergovernmental EU , with more emphasis on cooperation between sovereign states and less attention to strengthening common EU institutions . 
This is most notable among big member states like Britain , France , and Spain , and one can see why ; these are former &quot; great powers , &quot; which fear being submerged in a mega-Europe . 
They hope to perpetuate their influence by asserting claims of national sovereignty . 
But this is the wrong solution to the problem of a bigger EU . 
Decision-making is already difficult in an EU with 15 members . 
It will become impossible in an EU of 25-30 , unless the scope for majority voting is enlarged , and the veto power of individual states reduced . 
In short , a large EU will have to have much more the character of a federation than a small EU . 
This is not a question of ideology ; it is a question of arithmetic . 
An analogous argument applies to the development of a more effective EU foreign policy . 
Russia is no longer perceived as a military threat . 
But if the US continues to downgrade its commitment to multilateralism , and instead determines to intervene militarily wherever it pleases , then the world will become a much more dangerous place . 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair says that Europe should be a partner , not a servant or a rival , of the US . 
That would certainly be progress on the European side compared with what we have now , and would require much closer foreign policy cooperation within Europe than Britain , France , or Germany seem prepared to consider . 
But it takes two to tango . 
Unless there is a fundamental change in the posture of the Bush administration , it seems doubtful that partnership will be on offer at all . 
In short , if we are living in a world in which the US acts solely in its own immediate national interests , the EU will be compelled to do likewise . 
No EU government , however , yet seems prepared to face this .
