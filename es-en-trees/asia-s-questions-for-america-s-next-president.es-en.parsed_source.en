Asia &apos;s Questions for America &apos;s Next President 
NEW YORK - In one of the longest American Presidential campaigns in history , neither party has addressed one of the most critical issues of the day : how can the United States successfully integrate its domestic concerns with an increasingly competitive global marketplace ? 
At home and abroad , it is impossible to miss the breadth and depth of change sweeping the globe , particularly in Asia . 
While the US economy is in the final stages of a seismic shift from manufacturing to service-oriented industries , China and India are ascendant , and Muslims throughout Asia are clamoring for a greater role in global affairs . 
And yet the Democratic presidential candidates , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , and the Republican nominee , John McCain , continue to tiptoe around such issues . 
Instead , their campaigns &quot; treatment of US foreign policy has been reduced to endless debates about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and about the wisdom of the North America Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) . 
Surely this is unacceptable to every American committed to a safe and prosperous future . 
The next US president needs to provide a clearer understanding of how he or she will prepare America for a twenty-first century in which local issues are tied to global developments , global trends can have local implications , and America &apos;s international authority will confront Asia &apos;s newfound clout . 
With this in mind , here are five questions that should be posed to America &apos;s presidential candidates : 
1 . 
Big construction firms and technology companies such as Microsoft , IBM , and Cisco Systems already have huge campuses in India . 
But now we see Asian companies beginning to acquire valuable US-owned economic assets - witness India &apos;s Tata Group &apos;s proposed acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford . 
Do you see foreign investment and acquisitions in America as a positive development or a potential peril ? 
2 . 
America once defined free trade for the new global economy , but many Americans are now using demands for &quot; fair trade &quot; to impose reactionary and protectionist trade policies . 
As Democrats suggest renegotiating NAFTA , Asian countries are watching with increasing trepidation . 
South Korea , in particular , is left to wonder whether or not the US is serious about pursuing similar trade agreements with one of Asia &apos;s strongest economies and one of America &apos;s oldest regional allies . 
Will you back - or back away from - free trade pacts with Asia ? 
3 . 
The American invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan , regardless of their relative merits , have unquestionably poisoned America &apos;s standing among Asia &apos;s 900 million Muslims , from Pakistan to the Philippines and all points in between . 
A 2006 Pew poll found that support for the US in Indonesia , the world &apos;s most populous Muslim country , has plunged to around 30 % . 
How will you engage Muslims in Asia , and how will you garner support at home for stronger ties with Muslims around the world ? 
4 . 
The Asia Society recently co-presented a new education study that showed American 15-year-olds &quot; science proficiency ranked 25th out of 30 countries tested , and lagged far behind their peers in Japan , South Korea , and Hong Kong . 
Meanwhile , US colleges and universities are struggling to attract the best and brightest minds from abroad , because those students - and their professors - are increasingly being denied US visas or subjected to harrowing entry delays when they arrive . 
Business leaders , such as Microsoft &apos;s Bill Gates , have also complained about shortages of skilled workers , and have called for large increases in &quot; H1-B &quot; visas , which allow professionals to work in the US for short periods of time . 
How will you help American students compete globally , while ensuring a level playing field at home for talented foreign students and workers ? 
5 . 
Both China and India are demanding concessions from the US before they will even consider caps on greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Are you willing to sacrifice some economic growth domestically - or , conversely , are you willing to jeopardize relations with China and India - for the sake of the environment ? 
America &apos;s next president must re-engage with Asia not as an afterthought , and not as a corollary to the &quot; war on terror , &quot; but as a central component of a roadmap to a safe , secure , and prosperous future . 
He or she should start now by answering Asia &apos;s questions .
