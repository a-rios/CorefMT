What Bolivia \ u0027s Chaos Means 
The forced resignation of Bolivia &apos;s President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada , following a month of violent demonstrations , marks a tragic milestone whose meaning extends far beyond his impoverished country . 
Bolivia &apos;s civil and political breakdown provides another vivid example of the poverty of US foreign policy . 
Sánchez de Lozada is one of Latin America &apos;s true heroes , a leader who helped usher in democracy and modest - if fragile - economic growth during the past 20 years , including two terms as president . 
Yet now he has fled Bolivia in fear for his life . 
American arrogance and neglect played a big part in this stunning reversal . 
Virtually all of South America has been in deep economic malaise of late , with high unemployment , rising poverty , and growing social unrest . 
Argentina endured economic collapse and four failed presidencies during the past three years . 
Brazil is battling recession and rising unemployment . 
Political systems have fallen apart in Peru , Ecuador , and Venezuela . 
Colombia is in open civil war . 
As a landlocked Andean country , Bolivia suffers its own special distress . 
Its transport costs are among the highest in the world , reflecting mountainous terrain and international trade routes that must cross political boundaries and depend on foreign ports . 
This discourages inward investment and strains relations with coastal neighbors . 
Indeed , the precipitating factor in Bolivia &apos;s collapse was a plan to export natural gas to the US through archrival Chile , a country deeply resented since the War of the Pacific in the late 19 th century , which rendered Bolivia landlocked . 
Sánchez de Lozada spoke of the gas exports as a means for investing in health , education , and economic development . 
But Bolivia &apos;s impoverished population had been ripped off too many times and feared , understandably , that gas revenues would accrue to foreigners or to Bolivia &apos;s own rich . 
Yet the spark in Bolivia was more than a regional economic crisis amplified by bad geography and a distrusted gas deal . 
Just as US presidents treat the Middle East as America &apos;s gasoline station , they treat the Andean countries not as home to 130 million poor and struggling people , but , first and foremost , as suppliers of cocaine . 
Bolivia &apos;s peasant coca cultivators are viewed not as indigenous people trying to survive in a region mostly without jobs , but as drug traffickers . 
America &apos;s domestic public health problem is seen as an Andean-wide plot to be suppressed with military force , exacerbating violence throughout the region . 
When the Bolivian government before Sánchez de Lozada faced US demands to destroy the coca crop , I advised that it insist on adequate aid to finance economic development . 
Desperate for any assistance at all , Bolivia &apos;s governments ultimately uprooted thousands of hectares of peasant crops - and got almost nothing in return but a lot of phony slogans about alternative development . 
Not surprisingly , the 2002 elections turned on the explosive coca eradication issue . 
Evo Morales , the leader of the coca growers &apos; federation , came within a whisker of winning the presidency , helped by the US ambassador &apos;s warning that his election would be seen as hostile to America . 
That &quot; endorsement &quot; by itself was almost enough to give Morales the presidency . 
In the event , it put him into the leadership of the insurrection that toppled Sánchez de Lozada . 
The main surprise is that Sánchez de Lozada lasted as long as he did . 
He inherited an economic , political , and social crisis as deep as any in the world , and he warned President Bush last year that extreme poverty and widening ethnic divisions could incite insurrection . 
Bush literally laughed in his face , saying not to worry , that he , too , faced political pressures . 
Sánchez de Lozada pressed again for US financial help -  $ 150 million - but Bush ushered him from the Oval Office with a pat on the back . 
Sánchez de Lozada returned to Bolivia empty-handed , except for instructions from the IMF to implement austerity measures in accordance with the dictates of the US Treasury . 
The measures led to a police strike , followed by a popular insurrection and an assassination attempt . 
IMF officials deny responsibility for the upheaval , but have failed to provide an honest public appraisal of Bolivia &apos;s urgent financial needs . 
Even after a failed assassination attempt , the US again brushed off requests for aid . 
The US adventure in Iraq has squandered $ 150 billion over two years , while Bolivia received $ 10 million - that &apos;s right , $ 10 million - in &quot; emergency &quot; help , a fifteenth or less of what was realistically needed to ease the intense economic crisis and help displaced peasants . 
Now US interests in Bolivia lie in shambles : the country seethes with violence , and coca production is likely to soar . 
American foreign policy is brain dead . 
Even as Sánchez de Lozada was hounded from office on the streets of La Paz as an American lackey , the Bush administration showed no interest or support . 
An obsessive US administration , led by a President who reportedly believes that he is on a holy mission to fight terror in the Middle East , pays no attention to the rest of the world . 
Woe to any poor country that follows US dictates . 
A narrow-minded and violent US administration has lost interest even in helping its friends .
