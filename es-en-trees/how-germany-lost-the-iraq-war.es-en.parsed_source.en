How Germany Lost the Iraq War 
Wars always have winners and losers . 
Saddam Hussein - dead or on the run - is , of course , the Iraq war &apos;s biggest loser . 
But Germany has also lost much , including the many US troops who will now reportedly be re-deployed to bases in other countries . 
Despite the announcement of plans to create a European army along with France , Belgium , and Luxembourg , Germany is less relevant in both European and world politics than it was before the Iraq war . 
Repairing the damage will not be easy . 
Every part of Germany &apos;s international position has been wounded by the Iraq war . 
The country can no longer play the role of transatlantic mediator between France and America . 
It can forget about US support in its campaign to gain a permanent seat in the UN Security Council . 
Instead of forging a &quot; third way &quot; for Europe &apos;s left with British Prime Minister Tony Blair , Chancellor Gerhard Schröder needs Blair to plead his case with President George W. Bush , who feels personally betrayed by the Chancellor &apos;s conduct in the run-up to the war . 
In postcommunist Eastern Europe , Germany is no longer perceived as an absolutely dependable advocate of the region &apos;s needs . 
Multilateral institutions that served as pillars of German foreign policy for almost half-a-century have been weakened : the European Union &apos;s hopes for common foreign , security , and defense policies have been gravely jeopardized . 
From an American perspective , flexible ad hoc coalitions of the willing have turned out to be more useful than the established NATO alliance , where Germany led the fight to refuse Turkey &apos;s request for support . 
Even the UN - the institution that Schröder was supposedly defending - has been diminished by his fecklessness . 
But the heart of the matter is the deterioration of German-American relations . 
Germany is by no means the only sinner here , for US diplomacy over Iraq was often clumsy and bombastic . 
Nevertheless , pointing out others &apos; mistakes is not going to help rehabilitate Germany &apos;s position . 
German-American relations suffered a devastating blow when Schröder stoked the country &apos;s overwhelmingly pacifist attitudes . 
By doing so he drowned out the concerns about low growth and high unemployment that were threatening his re-election prospects . 
But that political strategy left President Bush believing that Schröder had stabbed him in the back . 
As with people , so too with states : trust once lost is extremely difficult to regain . 
Germany &apos;s opposition parties and much of its foreign policy establishment warned that the country risked diplomatic isolation , so Schröder joined an ad hoc coalition of the unwilling , along with France and Russia . 
Much of the world press dubbed this &quot; gang of three &quot; an &quot; axis , &quot; a word with sinister echoes of the German-Italian-Japanese World War II axis . 
Not surprisingly , Poland - like other Central and East European countries - sought reassurance from the US and Britain when their colossal neighbors , Germany and Russia , embarked on their anti-American flirtation . 
But wartime victory makes cowards of leaders who backed the wrong side . 
So , with Baghdad &apos;s fall , Schröder began to send conciliatory signals to Washington and London . 
Schröder implicitly began to welcome regime change in Iraq . 
During a Franco-German-Russian summit in St. Petersburg , he explicitly refrained from criticizing the US and Britain . 
&quot; I don &apos;t want to speak about the past , &quot; he emphasized , &quot; we should think about how the military victory can be turned to help the entire region . &quot; 
That French President Jacques Chirac is even less popular in the US than Schröder gives German diplomats slight consolation . 
But opposition to US policy from France never comes as a shock . 
Indeed , Chirac &apos;s tone and tactics conform to textbook Gaullist patterns . 
By contrast , German assertiveness vis-à-vis the US was stunning - perhaps because , as it is said , you have to be fully behind someone who you stab in the back . 
The Chancellor &apos;s aides try to justify Schröder &apos;s rhetoric as an expression of the country &apos;s political maturity . 
At long last , they say , German leaders can use the unrestricted sovereignty Germany acquired with reunification in 1990 . 
But the Chancellor &apos;s juvenile experiment in mature diplomacy has diminished , not expanded , Germany &apos;s prestige . 
Quite simply , German Gaullism doesn &apos;t work . 
After all , Germany &apos;s traditional low-key foreign policy made the country an anchor of NATO and helped secure reunification . 
That diplomatic tradition has never simply been about &quot; do-goodism &quot; and checkbook contributions to peacekeeping missions around the world . 
It was about creating and transferring stability through the strengthening of international governance and supranational structures . 
Germany is too big to abstain from leadership in Europe . 
But it is well advised to avoid being suspected of hegemonic goals . 
Sharing sovereignty with its fellow Europeans and exerting influence through European and Atlantic institutions remains Germany &apos;s most promising political strategy . 
Besides abandoning any Gaullist pretensions , the other lesson Germany must learn is that influence is based not only on soft &quot; civilian power , &quot; but also on hard military capabilities that are adapted to the exigencies of the post-Cold War world . 
If Germany wants to increase its diplomatic weight , it must increase its defense spending . 
Only an enhanced German relevance in European and world politics will convince America that it is time to bury the hatchet .
