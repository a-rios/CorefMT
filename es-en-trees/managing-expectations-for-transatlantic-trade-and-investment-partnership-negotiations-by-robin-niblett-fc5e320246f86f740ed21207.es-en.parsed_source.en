Transatlantic Trade-Offs 
LONDON - Almost two decades after the idea was first mooted , the United States and the European Union agreed last week to begin negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) . 
While both parties aim to eliminate remaining tariffs on bilateral trade , they are particularly eager to reduce the thicket of non-tariff barriers - mainly competing technical and sanitary standards and regulations - that have stifled development of the bilateral economic relationship . 
Closer regulatory cooperation may also help the US and the EU to confront what business leaders view as increasingly unfair competition from China both at home and abroad . 
But can the TTIP live up to the hype ? 
Tellingly , the High-Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth , which was tasked with identifying the policies and measures that should define the negotiations , has recommended a more conservative approach . 
Indeed , the Group &apos;s final report , released earlier this month , states that the agreement &quot; should be designed to evolve over time , &quot; moving &quot; progressively toward a more integrated transatlantic marketplace . &quot; 
Specifically , the group recommends establishing &quot; an on-going mechanism for improved dialogue and cooperation &quot; on regulatory issues and non-tariff barriers , as well as a &quot; framework for identifying opportunities for ... future regulatory cooperation . &quot; 
Such caution is warranted , given that some of the main principles that drive the two parties &quot; regulatory approaches are vastly different - and sometimes at odds with one another . 
For example , the EU has long been committed to the &quot; precautionary principle , &quot; which prevents products that may harm human health from entering the EU market - even if the scientific evidence is not yet conclusive . 
This principle underpins the EU &apos;s refusal to import genetically modified ( GM ) foods from the US , where they are widely consumed . 
But senior members of the US Congress have stressed that a successful agreement must include opening the EU market to all US agricultural products . 
Another potential area of contention - conflicting notions of personal privacy - could inhibit the two sides &quot; ability to accomplish their shared goal of opening up the digital market . 
In recent weeks , major US technology companies , including Google and Facebook , have been accused of aggressively lobbying the European Parliament to suspend plans to intensify privacy rules in the EU . 
A third challenge is rooted in Europe &apos;s deeply held skepticism of financial markets . 
The day after US President Barack Obama announced the launch of the TTIP negotiations , the European Commission released its blueprint for a Eurozone Financial Transaction Tax that would impose new costs on US banks operating in EU markets . 
Other cases in which barriers to transatlantic trade and investment conceal conflicting objectives and deep-rooted attitudes include France &apos;s protection of its cherished audiovisual sector and America &apos;s desire to continue to block European penetration of its iconic airline industry . 
Negotiators will also have to overcome significant structural obstacles . 
As the European Commission struggles to secure a clear negotiating mandate from all 27 member states , the US will face its own internal coordination problems . 
European countries succeeded in creating the Single Market in 1992 not by harmonizing all of their standards and regulations , but by agreeing to recognize one another &apos;s . 
If a product is approved for sale in one EU member state , it is considered safe enough to be sold in another . 
A similar policy of &quot; mutual recognition &quot; could be the key to successful US-EU trade negotiations , but only if both parties can overcome the biases that are built into their regulatory and political systems . 
Such barriers are particularly pronounced in the US , where Congress oversees the legal framework within which federal regulatory agencies - such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration - operate . 
Not only do the US administration and its federal agencies have to accept that a safety standard established and tested in Frankfurt or Athens is equivalent to its US counterpart ; congressional committees must agree . 
For its part , the EU would have to reconsider , for example , its policy on GM foods . 
The EU overcame national biases to establish the Single Market by instituting a process of legally binding qualified majority voting , whereby individual member states could be outvoted on specific regulations . 
But such an approach cannot be replicated to break the inevitable logjams of transatlantic regulatory negotiations . 
Faced with such significant obstacles , it is not surprising that the High-Level Working Group has settled on a more modest measure of success for TTIP negotiations . 
But this does not negate the partnership &apos;s value . 
Although transatlantic tariffs average only 3-5 % ( with higher peaks for some sensitive products ) , tariff elimination would have a significant impact , given that bilateral trade totals $ 650 billion annually . 
Simplifying customs procedures and opening up markets for public procurement could bring further benefits . 
And establishing a formal mechanism for transatlantic regulatory consultation will eventually pay off , one sector at a time . 
The TTIP that is signed in 2015 may not be the revolutionary and comprehensive agreement for which many observers are hoping .
