The Looming Death of Homo Economicus 
KIEL - The world seems to be on the verge of another &quot; great transformation , &quot; with changes far more profound than news-grabbing economic or geopolitical headlines about Asia &apos;s economic rise or the fires in the Middle East . 
The coming changes will fundamentally redefine the nature of our economic interactions - and the social dynamics that underlie them . 
This is a transformation on the scale of the shift , more than 8,000 years ago , from nomadic hunter-gatherer societies to settled agricultural ones , which eventually led to the rise of cities . 
A similar transformation occurred in Europe in the tenth century , with the emergence of guilds - associations of skilled workers who controlled the practice of their craft in a particular town - which paved the way for the Industrial Revolution . 
The particular characteristics of the impending transformation remain unclear . 
It may well involve revolutions in bio- , nano- , and digital technology , together with a social-networking revolution that eliminates geographical and cultural barriers . 
What is already clear , however , is that , like previous transformations , this one will involve a fundamental change in all of our economic relations and the social relations that support them . 
Mainstream economics offers a straightforward analysis of and policy response to such a transformation . 
Whenever technological or other changes allow for people to be compensated for the benefits that they confer on one another ( minus the costs ) , the price-based market system can adjust . 
When the changes create externalities , economic restructuring is required - say , adjustments in taxes and subsidies , regulatory shifts , or property-rights upgrading - to offset the costs and benefits for which the market cannot compensate . 
This approach is based on the assumption that , if everyone is fully compensated for the net benefits that they confer on others , individuals pursuing their own self-interest will , as Adam Smith put it , be led , &quot; as if by an invisible hand , &quot; to serve the public interest as well . 
According to this view , everyone is Homo economicus : a self-interested , fully rational individualist . 
But , as past &quot; great transformations &quot; demonstrate , this approach is inadequate , because it neglects the social underpinnings of market economies . 
In such economies , contracts tend to be honored voluntarily , not through coercive enforcement . 
What makes these economies function is not a policeman protecting every shop window , but rather people &apos;s trust , fairness , and fellow-feeling to honor promises and obey the prevailing rules . 
Where this social glue is lacking - such as between Israelis and Palestinians - people cannot exploit all of the available economic opportunities . 
This link is apparent in the deep social significance of most of an individual &apos;s economic transactions . 
When people acquire expensive cars , designer clothing , and opulent houses , they generally seek social recognition . 
When couples or friends give gifts to one another or take vacations together , they perform economic transactions inspired by affiliation and care . 
In short , mainstream economics - and the concept of homo economicus - recognizes only half of what makes us human . 
We are undoubtedly motivated by self-interest . 
This oversight is particularly crippling in view of the impending transformation , which will upend the underpinnings of contemporary society . 
Indeed , at present , despite unprecedented economic integration and new opportunities for cooperation , our social interactions remain atomized . 
The problem lies in deeply ingrained - and divisive - perceptions of identity . 
The world is divided into nation-states , each controlling many of the instruments of public policy . 
People &apos;s social allegiances are divided further by religion , race , occupation , gender , and even income bracket . 
Where social barriers are sufficiently strong , economic barriers are certain to appear . 
Clearly , economic success vitally depends on how people perceive their social affiliations . 
One view is that our identities are immutable , impermeable , exogenously generated , and intrinsically opposed to one another . 
This classic &quot; us versus them &quot; dichotomy leads to sympathy for one &apos;s in-group and implacable conflict with out-groups - a bottomless source of conflict throughout history . 
But another view is possible : each person has multiple identities , the salience of which is shaped by one &apos;s motivations and circumstances . 
This idea - which is firmly rooted in neuroscience , psychology , anthropology , and sociology - implies that an individual has significant latitude in shaping his or her identities . 
This is not to say that national and religious identities are not profoundly important . 
Instead of choosing identities that divide us , making it impossible to tackle multiplying global problems , we can shape identities that extend our sense of compassion and moral responsibility . 
A growing body of scientific evidence shows that compassion , like any other skill , can be ingrained and enhanced through teaching and practice . 
Educational institutions can thus work to develop students &quot; capacity for caring in tandem with their cognitive abilities . 
More broadly , societies everywhere should be driven by a common goal that transcends their diverse backgrounds . 
Resolving problems that extend across borders is a good place to start , with strategies involving specific tasks for various groups and countries to undertake that advance the greater good . 
Initiatives like conflict-resolution workshops , reconciliation commissions , cross-cultural education programs , and compulsory civic duty for school leavers could also help . 
The mainstream view that people are wholly self-interested economic actors denies our innate capacity for reciprocity , fairness , and moral responsibility . 
In deepening social affiliations , we can lay the groundwork for a new form of economy in which many more opportunities can be seized .
