Asia in the Balance 
CAMBRIDGE - Last year , the leaders of all five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council visited India , accompanied by delegations of business leaders . 
The Indian economy has been growing at more than 8 % annually , making it increasingly attractive for trade and investment . 
When US President Barack Obama visited in November , he supported permanent membership of the UN Security Council for India . 
So did British Prime Minister David Cameron , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev . 
Official pronouncements stress friendly relations between India and China , and some trade analysts argue that the two giant , rapidly growing markets will become an economic &quot; Chindia . &quot; 
When Premier Wen visited several years ago , he signed a comprehensive five-year strategic cooperation pact . 
As Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh put it at the time , &quot; India and China can together reshape the world order . &quot; 
Such statements reflect a considerable change from the hostility that bedeviled Indian-Chinese relations following the two countries &quot; 1962 war over a disputed border in the Himalayas . 
Nevertheless , strategic anxiety lurks below the surface , particularly in India . 
China &apos;s GDP is three times that of India &apos;s , its growth rate is higher , and its defense budget has been increasing . 
The border dispute remains unsettled , and both countries vie for influence in neighboring states such as Myanmar . 
But talk of India as a future great power is unavoidable , and some Indians predict a tri-polar world , anchored by the US , China , and India , by mid-century . 
India &apos;s population of 1.2 billion is four times that of the US , and likely to surpass China &apos;s by 2025 . 
Vijay Joshi of St John &apos;s College , Oxford , argues that , &quot; if we extrapolate present trends , India will have the world &apos;s third largest national income ( after the US and China ) within 25 years . &quot; 
For decades , India suffered from what some called the &quot; Hindu rate of economic growth &quot; of a little over 1 % per year . 
After independence in 1947 , India followed an inward-looking policy that focused on heavy industry . 
After market-oriented reforms in the early 1990 &quot; s , growth rates soared , with projections of double-digit growth in the future . 
Martin Wolf of the Financial Times calls India a &quot; premature superpower &quot; - a country with low living standards but a huge economy . 
He thinks that the Indian economy will be bigger than Britain &apos;s in a decade and bigger than Japan &apos;s in two . 
India has an emerging middle class of several hundred million , and English is an official language , spoken by 50-100 million people . 
Building on that base , Indian information industries are able to play a major global role . 
India has significant hard-power resources as well , with an estimated 60-70 nuclear weapons , intermediate-range missiles , a space program , 1.3 million military personnel , and annual military expenditure of nearly $ 30 billion , or 2 % of the world total . 
In terms of soft power , India has an established democracy , and a vibrant popular culture with transnational influence . 
India has an influential diaspora , and its motion picture industry , &quot; Bollywood , &quot; is the largest in the world in terms of the number of films produced yearly , out-competing Hollywood in parts of Asia and the Middle East . 
At the same time , India remains very much an underdeveloped country , with hundreds of millions of illiterate , destitute citizens . 
Around one-third of Indians live in conditions of acute poverty , and India accounts for roughly one-third of the world &apos;s poor . 
India &apos;s GDP of $ 3.3 trillion compares to China &apos;s $ 5 trillion , and is 20 % that of the United States . 
As a result , India &apos;s per capita income of $ 2,900 ( in purchasing-power-parity terms ) is one-half of China &apos;s and one-fifteenth that of the US . 
Even more striking , while 91 % of the Chinese population is literate and 43 % is urban , the numbers for India are only 61 % and 29 % , respectively . 
Each year , India produces about twice as many engineering and computing graduates as America , but The Economist reports that &quot; only 4.2 % are fit to work in a software product firm , and just 17.8 % are employable by an IT services company , even with six months training . &quot; 
A symptom of this is India &apos;s poor performance in international comparisons of universities : the 2009 Asian University Rankings , prepared by the higher education consultancy QS , shows the top Indian institution to be the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay , at number 30 . 
Ten universities in China and Hong Kong are ranked higher . 
High-tech exports are only 5 % of India &apos;s total exports , compared to 30 % for China . 
India is thus unlikely to develop the power resources to become an equal to China in the next decade or two . 
More recently , in 2009 , the border issue flared again . 
Indian officials are generally discrete in public about relations with China , but in private their concerns remain intense . 
Rather than becoming an ally , India is more likely to become one of the Asian countries that will tend to balance China &apos;s strategic rise .
