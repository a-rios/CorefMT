Kremlin Rules 
Long before Russia &apos;s Duma election on December 7th , one could predict the outcome : victory for the Edinstvo ( Unity ) party , President Vladimir Putin &apos;s main parliamentary ally . 
What was not predicted was the size of the victory for this so-called &quot; party of power , &quot; or the exceedingly poor showing by the Communist Party ( KPRF ) . 
In 1999 , Unity &apos;s main rival was the Fatherland / All Russia bloc ( OVR ) , led by ex-premier Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov , who at the time were very popular figures . 
Since then , the situation changed markedly . 
The OVR first became an ally of the Unity party , and then merged with it into what became known as United Russia , helping it become this year &apos;s clear front-runner . 
So the government-controlled media took aim at another antagonist , the Communist Party , which apparently never expect an attack on this scale . 
Disoriented and bewildered , the party withered under the pressure of the media assault , which was mostly carried out on state-run TV channels . 
The election result showed that the government &apos;s strategy paid off handsomely . 
Indeed , the Communist vote collapsed to a mere 12.7 % , down from 24 % in 1999 . 
But the Communists also have themselves to blame for their electoral debacle . 
Having won the most votes in two consecutive Duma elections , the Party now made a serious strategic blunder , exposing itself to attack by putting a number of major businessmen - or oligarchs - on its candidate list . 
They formed perfect targets . 
United Russia , on the other hand , based its campaign on the progress made during President Putin &apos;s tenure : notable economic growth and slight improvement in people &apos;s living standards . 
The party actively supports Putin , but refrained from appearing in televised debates , possibly because it has no charismatic leaders of its own who can excite the public with sharp polemics . 
A dull presentation could have adversely affected the party &apos;s rating . 
The refusal to accept any televised challenge , of course , aroused a lot of criticism in the media . 
Most forecasts estimated that United Russia , led by such prominent politicians as Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov , Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu , and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov , could take up to 30 % of the popular vote . 
Added to the winners in single-seat constituencies - half the total - this would ensure it a sturdy majority of 250 to 270 of the Duma &apos;s 450 seats . 
In the end , United Russia secured 37 % of the vote , with the additional seats it gained in the single-seat constituencies assuring it an overwhelming parliamentary majority . 
This means that the pro-Kremlin bloc probably attained the two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution , which would allow it to grant Putin a third four-year term , although Putin himself ruled this out last June . 
Although the Communist leader , Gennady Zyuganov , accuses the Kremlin of rigging the vote , his party is - at long last - beginning to look like a spent force . 
But the strong showing by Vladimir Zhirinovsky &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party , or the LDPR , seems equally surprising . 
Of course , Zhirinovsky &apos;s national / socialist rhetoric has hidden his almost slavish subservience to the Kremlin . 
Yet his party now seems to have fixed itself on the political landscape . 
Russians are not surprised at the poor showing of the so-called reformist forces , the Union of Right-Wing Forces ( SPS ) and the liberal Yabloko party . 
The leaders of the two parties - Boris Nemtsov and Grigory Yavlinsky , respectively , failed at the campaign &apos;s start to find common ground . 
By splitting the &quot; reform &quot; vote , both parties failed to win any seats in the Duma because neither surpassed the 5 % electoral threshold . 
The &quot; reformist &quot; bloc will be replaced by 
Because United Russia will hold a parliamentary majority , opposition to executive authority should be much weaker than when the Communists formed the largest faction . 
For the first time since the Soviet collapse , the Kremlin will have firm parliamentary support . 
For better or for worse , the government now has ample opportunity to enact its desired reforms , possibly including constitutional changes . 
President Putin and his allies have every reason to rejoice .
