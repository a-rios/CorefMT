Taming &quot; Speculative Capitalism &quot; 
Nicolas Sarkozy , the leading contender in the French presidential election , recently lashed out against what he called &quot; speculative capitalism , &quot; and says he wants to &quot; moralize the financial zone &quot; created by the euro . 
What does Sarkozy mean by &quot; speculative capitalism ? &quot; 
Something immoral , apparently , but what ? 
The term has rarely been used before , and seems to be redundant . 
After all , capitalism is practically a synonym for speculation , isn &apos;t it ? 
Sarkozy is expressing a wave of sentiment that is neither unique to his party nor to France . 
At stake with his comments are emerging ideas and attitudes that will inform the twenty-first century economy . 
So we should think hard about what &quot; speculative capitalism &quot; means . 
Sarkozy has called free trade &quot; a policy of naivet√© , &quot; and wants to take a number of steps that would stand in the way of economic globalization . 
Although he does want to make the French labor market less rigid , he would block foreign takeover bids of French companies and protect Airbus workers from possible job losses . 
Protecting France from speculative capitalism seems to mean interfering with free trade to protect local jobs . 
To be sure , Sarkozy is right to note the enormous risks that workers and their communities face in this rapidly globalizing world . 
But putting this problem center stage should not mean protecting existing jobs come what may . 
Capitalists put their money where they think it can get the highest return ; that is what we call speculation . 
They buy companies , break them up , recombine them , fire some employees , and hire others . 
To do this profitably , they cannot afford to let patriotism or sentiment interfere . 
They do business in whatever country is most advantageous . 
Rewarding successful ventures is the basic idea of capitalism - a dynamic process that Joseph Schumpeter called &quot; creative destruction . &quot; 
Under capitalism , one is immoral if one reneges on a contract or breaks the law , but not if one speculates . 
Planned economies were never able to flourish because uncertainty about the future is just too high , something that is best left to the speculators , with the potential of reward if they are right and the disciplining whip of the market if they are wrong . 
Concerns about free trade similar to Sarkozy &apos;s are gaining strength around the world . 
In an article last year in the US journal Foreign Affairs , Alan Blinder , a former advisor to President Bill Clinton and Vice-Chair of the US Federal Reserve Board , argued that the process of globalization has the potential to cause massive job loss in the future . 
Given that electronic communications technology has a powerful potential to replace employees with others who are thousands of miles away , we may now be seeing only the beginning of this process . 
Blinder is absolutely right that the problem could get worse . 
Deniers of the problem - such as economist Jagdish Baghwati - cannot prove that the worst will not happen . 
We ought to prepare for the possibility of massive turmoil in our economies in coming years , even if we cannot prove that it will happen , just as we should take steps against global warming , even if some scientists doubt that it is a problem . 
According to Blinder , governments should encourage education for jobs that are harder to outsource overseas . 
He wants the government to subsidize &quot; personally-delivered service &quot; jobs , which cannot be delivered over the Internet , to encourage the expansion of such jobs instead of &quot; impersonally-delivered services . &quot; 
Subsidies , of course , interfere with free trade . 
But Blinder &apos;s solution appears to be a creative new idea , and one may think of legitimate justifications for the government to interfere with free markets this way . 
His idea certainly is more focused and theoretically sound than Sarkozy &apos;s plans to protect existing jobs . 
In fact , Blinder &apos;s proposal is only one of many possible government policies aimed at dealing with the Internet-age turmoil in the market for jobs and livelihoods . 
Capitalist institutions include risk-management schemes that provide insurance , hedging , and diversification . 
Government can promote the democratization of such institutions so that they protect people from the very risks that they are worrying most about . 
Such possibilities include livelihood insurance , home equity insurance , income-linked loans , and GDP-linked and home-price-linked securities . 
Moreover , government can make our social insurance ( a government institution that complements private insurance ) more incentive-compatible and better at managing risks - and not just the risks of the extreme losers - by , say , launching inequality-indexation of the tax system . 
And governments should improve our information infrastructure , so that financial contracts can better capture the outcomes of economic risks . 
So Sarkozy shouldn &apos;t be lashing out against &quot; speculative capitalism . &quot; 
On the contrary , he should be asking how capitalism can be developed even further , with new institutions in finance and insurance to deal with the very important problem that his campaign has highlighted .
