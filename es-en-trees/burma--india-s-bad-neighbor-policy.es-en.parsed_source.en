Burma : India &apos;s Bad Neighbor Policy 
NEW DELHI - As stage-managed elections ratify the consequences of three decades of military rule in Burma , the perspective from its neighbor India may help explain why there is continued international acceptance of the country &apos;s long-ruling junta . 
Burma was ruled as part of Britain &apos;s Indian Empire until 1935 , and the links between the two countries remained strong after Burma gained its independence in 1947 . 
An Indian business community thrived in Burma &apos;s major cities , and cultural and political affinities were well established . 
India &apos;s nationalist leader and first prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , was a close friend of the Burmese nationalist hero Aung San , whose daughter , the Nobel laureate and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi , studied in New Delhi . 
For many years , India was unambiguously on the side of democracy , freedom , and human rights in Burma - and in ways more tangible than the rhetoric of the regime &apos;s Western critics . 
When the generals suppressed the popular uprising of 1988 , nullified the overwhelming election victory by Aung San Suu Kyi &apos;s National League for Democracy ( NLD ) in 1990 , shot students , and arrested the newly-elected leaders , India &apos;s government initially reacted as most Indians would have wanted . 
India gave asylum to fleeing students and a base for their resistance movement ( along with some financial help ) , and supported a newspaper and a radio station that propagated the democratic voice . 
But then reality intruded . 
India &apos;s strategic rivals , China and Pakistan , began to court the Burmese generals . 
Major economic and geopolitical concessions were offered to both suitors . 
The Chinese even began developing a port on the Burmese coast , far closer to Calcutta than to Canton . 
And the generals began providing safe havens and arms to a motley assortment of anti-Indian rebel movements that would wreak havoc in India &apos;s northeastern states and retreat to sanctuaries in the newly-renamed Myanmar . 
All this was troubling enough to Indian policymakers , who were being painfully reminded of the country &apos;s vulnerability to a determined neighbor . 
The clincher came when large deposits of natural gas were found in Burma , which , it was clear , would not be available to an India deemed hostile to the junta . 
India &apos;s rivals were gaining ground in its own backyard , while Indian businesses were losing out on new economic opportunities . 
The price of pursuing a moral foreign policy simply became too high . 
So India turned 180 degrees . 
When Pakistan &apos;s President , Pervez Musharraf traveled to Myanmar to celebrate his country &apos;s new relationship with his fellow generals , India &apos;s Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh soon followed . 
The increasingly forlorn resistance operations staged from Indian territory were shut down in the hope of reciprocation from the Burmese side . 
And India sweetened the generals &quot; tea by providing military assistance and intelligence support to their own never-ending counter-insurgencies . 
India &apos;s journey was complete : from standing up for democracy , India had graduated to aiding and abetting the military regime in Rangoon ( now Yangon ) . 
When monks were being mown down on the streets of Yangon in 2006 , the Indian government called for negotiations , muttered banalities about national reconciliation , and opposed sanctions . 
( At the same time , Indian diplomats intervened discreetly from time to time on behalf of Suu Kyi , though their effectiveness was limited by India &apos;s unwillingness to alienate the junta . ) 
All of this was in fact perfectly understandable . 
Officials in New Delhi were justified in reacting acerbically to Western critics of its policy . 
India needed no ethical lessons from a United States and a Britain that have long coddled military dictators in India &apos;s South Asian neighborhood , notably in Pakistan . 
Any Indian government &apos;s primary obligation is to its own people , and there is little doubt that the economic opportunities provided by Burmese oil and gas are of real benefit to Indians . 
There is also the strategic imperative of not ceding ground to India &apos;s enemies on its own borders . 
India confronts an inescapable fact of geopolitics : you can put your ideals on hold , but you cannot change who your neighbors are . 
India &apos;s government cannot be blamed for deciding that its national interests in Burma are more important than standing up for democracy there . 
The member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations , on Burma &apos;s eastern flank , have made similar calculations . 
But many Indians are asking themselves what such a policy does to India as a civilization . 
If that idealistic democrat Nehru had not been cremated , India &apos;s stance toward Burma might cause him to turn over in his grave . 
It is a policy that is governed by the head rather than the heart , but in the process India is losing a little bit of its soul .
