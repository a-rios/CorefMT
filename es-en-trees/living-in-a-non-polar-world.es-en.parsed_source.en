Living in a Non-Polar World 
NEW YORK - Today &apos;s world is dominated not by one or two or even several powers , but rather is influenced by dozens of state and non-state actors exercising various kinds of power . 
A twentieth century dominated first by a few states , then , during the Cold War , by two states , and finally by American preeminence at the Cold War &apos;s end , has given way to a twenty-first century dominated by no one . 
Call it non-polar . 
Three factors have brought this about . 
First , some states have gained power in tandem with their increased economic clout . 
Second , globalization has weakened the role of all states by enabling other entities to amass substantial power . 
And , third , American foreign policy has accelerated the relative decline of the United States vis-à-vis others . 
The result is a world in which power is increasingly distributed rather than concentrated . 
The emergence of a non-polar world could prove to be mostly negative , making it more difficult to generate collective responses to pressing regional and global challenges . More decision makers make it more difficult to make decisions . Non-polarity also increases both the number and potential severity of threats , be they rogue states , terrorist groups , or militias . 
Still , if non-polarity is inevitable , its character is not . 
A great deal can and should be done to shape the non-polar world . 
On the contrary , left to its own devices , a non-polar world will become messier over time . 
Resisting the spread of nuclear weapons and unguarded nuclear materials may be as important as any other set of undertakings . 
If internationally managed enriched-uranium or spent-fuel banks are established , countries could gain access to nuclear power but not come to control the material needed for bombs . 
Security assurances and defensive systems could be provided to states that might otherwise feel compelled to develop their own nuclear programs to counter those of their neighbors . 
Combating terrorism is also essential if the non-polar era is not to turn into a modern Dark Age . 
There are many ways to weaken existing terrorist organizations by using intelligence , law enforcement resources , and military capabilities . 
But this is a loser &apos;s game unless something can be done to reduce recruitment . 
More importantly , governments must find ways to integrate alienated young men and women into their societies , which requires greater political freedom and economic opportunity . 
Trade also can be a powerful force in a non-polar world by giving states a stake in avoiding conflict , generating greater wealth , and strengthening the foundations of domestic political order - thereby decreasing the chance of state failure as well . 
To this end , the scope of the World Trade Organization should be extended through the negotiation of future global arrangements that reduce subsidies and both tariff and non-tariff barriers . 
A similar level of effort might be needed to ensure the continued flow of investment . The goal should be to create a World Investment Organization , which , by encouraging cross-border capital flows , would minimize the risk that &quot; investment protectionism &quot; impedes activities that , like trade , are economically beneficial and build political bulwarks against instability . 
A WIO could encourage transparency on the part of investors , determine when national security is a legitimate reason for prohibiting or limiting investment , and establish a dispute-resolution mechanism . 
More effort also will be needed to prevent state failure and deal with its consequences . The US and other developed countries should enhance their military capacities to deal with the type of threats being faced in Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as establish a pool of civilian talent to assist with basic nation-building tasks . 
Greater economic and military assistance to increase states &quot; ability to meet their responsibilities to their citizens and neighbors will also be essential . 
Multilateralism will be critical in a non-polar world . 
To succeed , though , it must be recast to include entities other than the great powers . 
The United Nations Security Council and the G-8 should be reconstituted to reflect the world of today rather than the post-1945 era , and the participation of non-state actors in multilateral organizations and processes will need to be considered . 
Multilateralism may have to be less comprehensive and less formal , at least initially . 
Networks will be needed alongside organizations . 
Getting everyone to agree on everything will be difficult ; instead , we should consider accords with fewer parties and narrower goals . 
Trade is something of a model here , insofar as bilateral and regional accords are filling the vacuum created by the failure to conclude a global trade round . 
The same is true of climate change : agreement on certain aspects of the problem ( say , deforestation ) or involving only some countries ( the major carbon emitters , for example ) may prove feasible , whereas an accord that includes every country and tries to resolve every issue may not . 
Multilateralism à la carte is likely to be the order of the day . 
This is less than optimal , but in a non-polar world , what is best may well prove the enemy of the possible .
