The Living Legacy of Helsinki 
VIENNA - Forty years ago , the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe concluded with the signing of the Helsinki Final Act , a historic triumph of cooperation over conflict that set the stage for the end of the Cold War . 
The accord represented a revolutionary approach to comprehensive security , as well as to bilateral and multilateral relations . 
Its signatories recognized a direct link between political and military issues and human rights concerns - and that this link is a fundamental component of peace and security . 
That is why , when Serbia was entrusted to lead the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , which grew from the Helsinki conference , this year , we were looking forward to celebrating the accord &apos;s many achievements on its 40th anniversary . 
But , with the resurgence of armed conflict in Europe challenging the Helsinki Final Act &apos;s fundamental principles , this anniversary has taken on new meaning . 
The crisis in Ukraine has , in fact , underscored the Final Act &apos;s enduring relevance . 
Indeed , the only way to reconsolidate European security is to reach a durable settlement based on its principles ; indeed , had those principles been respected , the current crisis in Ukraine would not have occurred in the first place . 
It is now apparent that the roots of that crisis are far deeper than anyone initially realized . 
Well before the turmoil in Ukraine erupted , the East-West divide , which our predecessors worked hard to close in Helsinki , had begun to reemerge . 
A growing sense of mistrust and hostility , together with a diminishing commitment to the OSCE &apos;s brand of comprehensive security , was hindering cooperation in various areas . 
Constructive engagement on security issues had been difficult for some time , reflected in a lack of progress on arms control and other key areas of the OSCE agenda . 
The emergence of the crisis in and around Ukraine has only made these challenges more profound , and the search for a solution more urgent . 
The high-level Panel of Eminent Persons on European Security as a Common Project , established at the Basel Ministerial Council by last year &apos;s Swiss OSCE chairmanship , provided invaluable insights when they presented their Interim Report on European security at the Munich Security Conference Core Group Meeting in Vienna this week . 
The report focuses on the lessons of the OSCE &apos;s engagement in Ukraine , and part of the solution is reflected in the Panel &apos;s title ; 
The OSCE could play a pivotal role , serving , like the Helsinki conference 40 years ago , as a platform to overcome the existing divide , restore trust , and rebuild a cooperative approach to common security concerns . 
The most visible aspects of the OSCE response to the crisis in and around Ukraine have been carried out by the Trilateral Contact Group and the Special Monitoring Mission . 
As the only regional platform that brings all of the key stakeholders to the table , the OSCE plays a vital role in keeping the lines of communication open and finding opportunities for joint action . 
Given our good relations with all the key stakeholders in the crisis , Serbia can contribute to the process . 
Our chief objectives are preventing the crisis from escalating into a larger conflict , ensuring a sustainable political process , and preserving the inclusive and cooperative nature of the OSCE &apos;s work . 
There is little doubt that de-escalation on the ground and visible progress in the Trilateral Contact Group - and the four working groups operating under its auspices - would set the stage for renewed discussions on broader European security issues and the future role of the OSCE . 
Given the obvious imperative for cooperative solutions to address transnational and global security threats , this could not be more important . 
Simply put , without a shared approach to security and a dedicated joint response , overcoming our current challenges will be virtually impossible . 
And , in fact , the situation could worsen considerably , with so-called &quot; frozen &quot; conflicts heating up and reverting to armed confrontation . 
As growing instability exacerbates social tensions , ethnic conflict , radicalization , and violent extremism become increasingly likely . 
The East-West divide that leaders in Helsinki confronted in 1975 was much wider than the one that that exists today . 
Yet , with courage and commitment , they managed to produce a pragmatic compromise based on a set of key principles - a compromise that opened the way for far-reaching cooperation and , indeed , the emergence of today &apos;s interconnected and interdependent world . 
Today &apos;s leaders must show similar wisdom and vision , supporting the OSCE &apos;s efforts to revitalize the principles of the Helsinki accord . 
This will require increased investment of both financial resources and political capital - and a shared commitment to put that investment to good use . 
Serbia , a post-conflict society built on a series of compromises , is well placed to coordinate Europe &apos;s much-needed security dialogue during its chairmanship of the OSCE - an organization that helped us through our own transition . 
What better advocate is there than one who speaks with conviction gained from personal experience ? 
The Helsinki principles do not need to be reconsidered ; on the contrary , they need to be reaffirmed , strengthened , and safeguarded . 
The platform is already in place .
