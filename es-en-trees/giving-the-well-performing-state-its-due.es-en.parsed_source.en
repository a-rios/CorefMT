Giving the Well-Performing State Its Due 
MADRID - The triumph of democracy and market-based economics - the &quot; End of History , &quot; as the American political philosopher Francis Fukuyama famously called it - which was proclaimed to be inevitable with the fall of the Berlin Wall , soon proved to be little more than a mirage . 
However , following China &apos;s intellectual pirouette to maintain one-party rule while embracing the capitalist credo , history &apos;s interpreters shifted their focus to the economy : not everybody would be free and elect their government , but capitalist prosperity would hold sway worldwide . 
Now , however , the economic tumult shaking Europe , the erosion of the middle class in the West , and the growing social inequalities worldwide are undermining capitalism &apos;s claim to universal triumph . 
Hard questions are being asked : Is capitalism as we know it doomed ? 
The pervasive soul-searching prompted by such questions has nurtured a growing recognition that capitalism &apos;s success depends not only on macroeconomic policy or economic indicators . 
The West overlooked the fundamental importance of this while it was fighting communism . 
The standard bearers of the Cold War were not just the United States and the Soviet Union , but , in ideological terms , the individual and the collectivity . 
When competing in newly independent or developing countries , this ideological opposition became Manichean , fostering a fierce suspicion , if not outright rejection , of rival principles . 
As a result , strengthening state institutions was too often seen in the West as communist subterfuge , while the Soviet bloc viewed the slightest notion of individual freedom and responsibility as a stalking horse for capitalist counter-revolution . 
Leading economists have long argued that the West &apos;s greater reliance on markets resulted in faster and more robust economic growth . 
But viewing the state and the market in terms of their inherent conflict no longer reflects reality ( if it ever did ) . 
Indeed , it is increasingly obvious that the threat to capitalism today emanates not from the state &apos;s presence , but rather from its absence or inadequate performance . 
Consider recent events in Argentina , which is facing certain economic losses as anxious investors have second thoughts about the country in the aftermath of the government &apos;s nationalization of energy giant YPF . 
That response is only logical , as investors seek the security of a well-functioning legal system to protect them from capricious political decisions . 
Mexico provides further proof that the market alone is not enough . 
An efficient judiciary and effective policing are necessary for capitalism to thrive . 
In Brazil , the government is daring , for the first time , to address the lawlessness of the overcrowded favelas that ring the country &apos;s large cities . 
Or consider Ghana &apos;s prosperity and how , like Brazil &apos;s , it is going hand in hand with improved governance . 
At the opposite extreme , Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez &apos;s undermining of his country &apos;s institutions , prodding it onto a narco-state trajectory , places Venezuela alongside Haiti as an exception to Latin America &apos;s recent economic success . 
More generally , the world &apos;s thriving countries are those with strong and effective institutions , backed by legal frameworks that guarantee the rule of law . 
Latin America and Africa are not the only examples that prove the point . 
The European Union &apos;s internal problems , and its ongoing sovereign-debt crisis , are clearly linked to the weakness of its institutions , and , on Europe &apos;s periphery , it still confronts feckless democracies . 
Indeed , on Europe &apos;s doorstep , the show trial and imprisonment of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is jeopardizing her country &apos;s international economic standing . 
In particular , President Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s contempt for the rule of law has put Ukraine &apos;s relations with the European Union in cold storage , with a comprehensive free-trade and association agreement on hold pending the release of Tymoshenko and other political prisoners . 
Meanwhile , political trials in Egypt are attracting international attention and deterring foreign investment . 
In Asia , China is exposing the fallacy of looking at state capitalism as a competing alternative to liberal capitalism . 
Approaching them as alternatives is , in fact , little more than an intellectual remnant of the Cold War , much like the concept of &quot; state capitalism &quot; itself . 
With its remarkable ability to adapt , China is making strides to accommodate the rising power of its markets and people . 
In the process , officials are acknowledging the importance of good governance , as demonstrated by recent efforts to justify the purge and investigation of Bo Xilai as an example of the Communist Party &quot; safeguarding the rule of law . &quot; 
Adam Smith , that icon of market theory , argued that wealth is created when public institutions enable the &quot; invisible hand &quot; of the market to align interests . 
The Cold War distorted that wisdom . 
In a world free of that era &apos;s ideological constraints , it is time to say loud and clear that the future of capitalism is linked to effective governance and the rule of law , and thus to the consolidation of well-functioning states .
