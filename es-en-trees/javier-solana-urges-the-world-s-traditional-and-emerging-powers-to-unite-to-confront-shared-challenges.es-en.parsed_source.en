Grave New World 
MADRID - Global transformations are nothing new . 
But , with globalization and technological advancements , the pace and scale of such transformations have accelerated considerably . 
In the coming decades , this trend will only intensify - bringing with it significant potential for instability . 
It has been more than 20 years since Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq invaded Kuwait , prompting the near-unanimous adoption of United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding the withdrawal of Iraqi forces . 
When Saddam defied the resolutions , a 34-country coalition , supporting the United States-led air offensive known as Operation Desert Storm , drove his troops out of Kuwait . 
That was in 1991 , when the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse had left the US as the world &apos;s only superpower . 
But that is no longer the case - a reality that is reflected in the international community &apos;s muddled responses to similar territorial breaches today . 
Consider Russia &apos;s invasion and annexation of Crimea earlier this year . 
Though the move clearly violated Ukraine &apos;s territorial integrity , 11 countries voted against the UN resolution condemning the action , and 58 countries - including all of the non-Western powers - abstained . Clearly , the global balance of power has changed . 
In international politics , perceptions matter - sometimes even more than reality . 
The perception today is that America &apos;s unipolar moment has come to an end ; 
Europe is on the decline ; and a new set of powers is rising , bringing their own unique worldviews to global affairs . 
In a sense , this might seem like a good thing . 
More varied perspectives could enrich multilateral processes and generate more comprehensive solutions to global problems . 
Though the world is becoming increasingly interconnected , and challenges are no longer confined to national or even regional borders , major powers are increasingly reluctant to assume global responsibilities . 
Worse , given their frequent unwillingness to accommodate one another &apos;s interests , impasses - even clashes - become likely . 
Strong , effective , and inclusive multilateral institutions can play a vital role in combating this instability and fostering cooperation . 
But even the best-designed structures can achieve little without the political will to resolve conflicts through dialogue . 
In order to make progress , countries must learn to defend their principles while respecting those of others - and never to lose sight of their shared interests and objectives . 
Without such a unified approach , geopolitical stability is diminished . 
For example , Ukraine has been an independent country since 1991 and is fully integrated into the international system , having ceded its nuclear weapons in 1994 and presided over three sessions of the UN General Assembly . 
In failing to craft an adequate response to the Russian invasion , however , the international community pushed Ukraine toward a dark past . 
One hopes that the recently concluded Minsk Protocol - which includes 12 provisions , including a cease-fire and a program of economic recovery - succeeds in resolving the conflict . 
In any case , international stability has been compromised - and several more potentially destabilizing developments are on the horizon . 
In the developed world , US President Barack Obama &apos;s tenure will soon end . 
European politics are , too , undergoing a potentially significant transition , with the new European Commission set to commence operations , against a worrying background of rising nationalism in European Union member states . 
Two leaders who will remain in power for the foreseeable future are Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping - both of whose countries have generated instability in their respective regions . 
Long before Russia invaded Ukraine , China was engaged in territorial disputes with several of its neighbors , most notably in the East and South China Seas . 
Furthermore , Russia and China are pushing back against traditional Western dominance in multilateral institutions . 
They - along with Brazil , India , and South Africa ( the BRICS ) - have established their own development bank , motivated partly by the International Monetary Fund &apos;s failure to fulfill its 2010 pledge to adjust voting rights to reflect the global balance of economic power . 
( Until the 2010 G-20 summit where that pledge was made , China had the same voting rights as Belgium . ) 
All of this uncertainty surrounding the world &apos;s emerging and traditional superpowers has impeded efforts to address security challenges in the Middle East , from the enduring Israel-Palestine conflict and the aftermath of the Arab Spring to the new and potent threat posed by the Islamic State . 
Unlike Al Qaeda , the Islamic State is not a fragmented network of relatively small cells ; it is a territorial entity operating as a pseudo-state in Syrian and Iraqi territory . 
The US has rushed to form a confusing coalition with nearly 30 countries , including ten Arab states . 
How the coalition will be organized and what results it will achieve remain to be seen . 
Here , the European Union could help . 
In fact , when the US first employed its so-called &quot; leading from behind &quot; strategy during the 2011 intervention in Libya , European countries were forced to assume greater responsibility . 
Instead of viewing that intervention as an anomaly , the EU should recognize the need to enhance its role in defending global security - not least to uphold its own interest in a prosperous and stable neighborhood . 
In this sense , the EU &apos;s decision to delay implementing its association agreement with Ukraine in order to create space to pursue consensus with Russia is a positive indicator . 
In a multipolar world , actors with widely divergent worldviews must work together to advance their shared interest in security , stability , and prosperity . 
It is time for all of the world &apos;s powers to recognize their responsibility for making constructive cooperation a reality .
