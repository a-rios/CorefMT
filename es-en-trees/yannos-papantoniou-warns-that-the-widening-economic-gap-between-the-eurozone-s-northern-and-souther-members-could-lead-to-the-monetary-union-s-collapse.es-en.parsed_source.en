The Re-Division of Europe 
ATHENS - As the eurozone debt crisis has steadily widened the divide between Europe &apos;s stronger northern economies and the weaker , more debt-laden economies in the south ( with France a kind of no man &apos;s land economy in between ) , one question is on everyone &apos;s mind : Can Europe &apos;s monetary union - indeed , the European Union itself - survive ? 
While the eurozone &apos;s northern members enjoy low borrowing costs and stable growth , its southern members face high borrowing costs , recession , and deep cuts in incomes and social spending . 
They have also suffered substantial output losses , and have far higher unemployment rates than their northern counterparts . 
Unemployment in the eurozone as a whole averages about 12 % , compared to more than 25 % in Spain and Greece ( where youth unemployment now stands at 60 % ) . 
Indeed , while aggregate per capita income in the eurozone remains at 2007 levels , Greece has been pushed back to 2000 levels , and Italy today finds itself somewhere in 1997 . 
Europe &apos;s southern economies owe their deteriorating circumstances largely to excessive austerity and the absence of measures to compensate for demand losses . 
Currency devaluation - which would boost the competitiveness of domestic industry by lowering export prices - obviously is not an option in a monetary union . 
But Europe &apos;s stronger economies have resisted pressure to undertake more expansionary fiscal policies , which would lift demand for its weaker economies &quot; exports . 
The European Central Bank did not follow the lead of other advanced-country central banks , such as the US Federal Reserve , in pursuing a more aggressive monetary policy to cut borrowing costs . 
And no financing has been offered for public-investment projects in the southern countries . 
Moreover , fiscal and financial measures aimed at strengthening eurozone governance have been inadequate to restore confidence in the euro . 
And Europe &apos;s troubled economies have been slow to undertake structural reforms ; improvements in competitiveness reflect wage and salary cuts , rather than productivity gains . 
While these policies - or lack thereof - have impeded recovery in the southern countries , they have yielded reasonable growth and very low unemployment rates for the northern economies . 
In fact , by maintaining large trade surpluses , Germany is exporting unemployment and recession to its weaker neighbors . 
As Europe &apos;s north-south divide widens , so will interest-rate differentials ; as a result , conducting a single monetary policy will become increasingly difficult . 
In the recession-afflicted south , continued fiscal consolidation will demand new austerity measures - a prospect that citizens will reject . 
Such impasses will lead to social tension and political crisis , or to new requests for financial assistance , which the northern countries are certain to resist . 
Either way , financial and political instability could lead to the common currency &apos;s collapse . 
As long as the eurozone establishes a kind of wary equilibrium , with the weaker economies stabilizing at low growth rates , current policies are unlikely to change . 
Incremental intergovernmental solutions will continue to prevail , and Europe &apos;s economy will soldier on , steadily losing ground to the US and emerging economies like China and India . 
For now , Germany is satisfied with the status quo , enjoying stable growth and retaining control over domestic economic policy , while the ECB &apos;s limited powers and strict mandate to maintain price stability ease fears of inflation . 
But how will Germany react when the north-south divide becomes large enough to threaten the euro &apos;s survival ? 
The answer depends on how Germans perceive their long-term interests , and on the choices of Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
Her recent election to a third term offers room for bolder policy choices , while forcing her to focus more on her legacy - specifically , whether she wishes to be associated with the euro &apos;s collapse or with its revival . 
Two outcomes now seem possible . 
One scenario is that the economic and political crisis in the southern countries spreads , inciting fears in Germany that the country faces a long-term threat . 
This could drive Germany to withdraw from the eurozone and form a smaller currency union with other northern countries . 
The second possibility is that the crisis remains relatively contained , leading Germany to pursue closer economic and fiscal union . 
This would entail the mutualization of some national debt and the transfer of economic-policy sovereignty to supranational European institutions . 
Of course , such a move would carry considerable political costs in Germany , where many taxpayers recoil at the notion of assuming the debts of the fiscally profligate southern countries , without considering how much Germany would benefit from a stable and dynamic monetary union . 
But a new grand coalition between Merkel and the Social Democrats could be sufficient to make this shift possible . 
Even so , there could be victims . 
Indeed , the continued failure of smaller countries like Greece and Cyprus to fulfill their commitments reinforces the impression that they will forever be dependent on financial assistance . 
The exit of one or two of these &quot; undisciplined &quot; countries could be a requirement for the German public to agree to such a policy shift . 
Europe &apos;s north-south divide has become a time bomb lying at the foundations of the currency union . 
Defusing it will require less austerity , more demand stimulus , greater investment support , deeper reforms , and meaningful progress toward economic and political union . 
One hopes that modest recovery in the south , aided by strong German leadership in the north , will steer Europe in the right direction .
