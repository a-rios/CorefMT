Turkey &apos;s Choice 
In what may be Turkey &apos;s most important political event since the republic was founded in the 1920 &quot; s , the Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) has won a landslide parliamentary election victory , with around 47 % of the vote . 
Only two other parties - the Republican People &apos;s Party ( CHP ) with 21 % and the National Movement Party ( MHP ) with 14 % - surpassed the 10 % threshold for representation in parliament . 
A number of independents will complete the legislative roster . 
What makes the result so complex is that the ruling AKP got far more votes - up 13 percentage points from 2002 - but fewer seats than it had before . 
The party will be able to form a government by itself , but will lack the two-thirds majority needed to bring about some of the big changes that it seeks . 
Still , the AKP can be satisfied that after five years in office its popular support has climbed , while the opposition has been shown to be incapable of challenging it seriously . 
The AKP &apos;s resounding victory means that the Turkish republic originally shaped as a secular state by Kemal Ataturk in the 1920 &quot; s is dead . 
However , this does not necessarily mean that Turkey will become an Islamic , must less an Islamist , country . 
Ataturk viewed Islam as a major factor holding back Turkey &apos;s progress . 
He sought to banish Islam as a political and social force from the public sphere , though of course the vast majority of the population remained Muslim by religion . 
For Ataturk , Westernization and modernization went hand in hand . 
And , indeed , Turkey achieved great success - arguably more than any other Muslim-majority state in the world - in building democracy , maintaining stability , and moving forward economically . 
This period came to an end for several reasons . 
A key factor was the increasing prominence and power of more traditional sections of the population from central Anatolia , where many small businesses grew big , enriching a more Islamic-oriented middle class . 
At the same time , millions of people emigrated from villages to cities , becoming mobilized and politicized as a result . 
The end of the Cold War - in which Turkey was a frontline state - and the growth of political Islam elsewhere also contributed to a rebirth of Islam in the public arena . 
Equally significant was the development in the old Islamic party of talented leaders that wanted to break with its backward-looking ways and extremist image . 
They successfully reconciled Islamic politics with the Turkish lifestyle and modernity in general . 
Cleverly , they positioned the party as conservative rather than Islamist - a process aided by the corruption , bickering , and incompetence of the existing parties . 
Indeed , while the socialist left survived by uniting around the CHP , the conservative parties that largely dominated Turkish politics for a quarter-century fell apart . 
Unwilling to change or work together , and unable to devise ways of appealing to voters , these once-powerful groups simply disappeared , leaving the AKP largely in control of the conservative electoral base . 
But not completely . 
The election &apos;s other success story was the MHP , which has often been seen as a neo-fascist party since its creation immediately after World War II , but which has been reinventing itself along conservative nationalist lines . 
The fact that two-thirds of the voters supported parties that were long considered extremist and whose allegiance to democracy is questionable has shocked many Turks , including those who comprised most of the ruling elite in modern times . 
There are two sets of questions that now need to be answered . 
First , what does the AKP want ? 
Is it a conservative party of good government that seeks equality for Islam in the public sphere , as its leaders usually suggest , or an Islamist wolf in moderate sheep &apos;s clothing , as its enemies fear ? 
These alternatives are not necessarily contradictory . 
The AKP contains people with both views . 
Moreover , it might be that the party will push as far as it can until it is stopped by fear of a military coup or a rejection of its program by the voters . 
That leads to the second question : how far can the AKP go in changing Turkish society ? 
The problem is that unless there is a viable opposition , the only check on the AKP will be its own conscience and a crackdown by the still secular-oriented armed forces . 
But , as part of its seemingly endless effort to get into the European Union - an aspiration that seems all but doomed at present - Turkey implemented reforms that undercut the military &apos;s political role . 
Also at the top of the AKP &apos;s agenda is choosing a president in tune with its worldview . 
The president names the head of the armed forces , a power that could potentially turn the military into a servant of the government . 
Given that the government can change laws , name judges , and staff the state administration , Turkey &apos;s slide to another political model could reach a point of no return . 
But what precisely would that model be ? 
If such a model means a Turkey that is more willing to embrace its traditional and religious heritage , the outcome would be relatively benign for most of its citizens as well as its strategic alliances . 
But if it means a more anti-Western Turkey increasingly oriented toward Iran , Syria , and radical Islamist movements , a major shift in international politics would be accompanied by mounting domestic instability .
