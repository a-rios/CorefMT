Latin America &apos;s New Regionalism 
We live in a world crisscrossed by borders , drawn and redrawn throughout history , chosen by fancy or caprice , and all too often defended by bloodshed . 
They have always been imperfect , and today their flaws are visible in new ways . 
Waves of immigrants , driven from their homes by poverty and desperation , blend one nation &apos;s struggles into another &apos;s . 
Climate change caused by environmental destruction in one place can cause floods , storms , drought , and famine anyplace , and easy global travel means that diseases travel more quickly . 
Increasingly , we must recognize that our borders are not fortress walls . 
They are simply lines that we have sketched in the air . 
In short , no nation on this changing , shrinking planet can truly address its own problems in isolation . 
Nowhere is this more true than in Latin America and the Caribbean , where the uneven blows of history and varied national policies have resulted in a patchwork of fates for our many peoples . 
Today - sometimes across borders , sometimes within them - once-unthinkable wealth exists alongside extreme poverty and all its social ills . 
Ours is a region of cruel contrasts . 
Fortunately , many countries in this part of the world have recognized that regional welfare must be addressed as a regional challenge . 
I am proud to list Costa Rica among them . 
Our nation may be small , but our commitment to improving the well-being of this region is anything but . 
We have an important role to play in advancing the principles of sound knowledge , quality decision-making , and transparency . 
Costa Rica is the region &apos;s most stable democracy , a place where peace , nature , and education are valued above all . 
While we rejoice in our successes , however , we have long recognized that our future is tied to our neighbors &quot; challenges , whether they include military conflicts , as was true 20 years ago , or hunger and disease , as is the case today . 
That &apos;s why I am pleased that in October , the Inter-American Development Bank and the Copenhagen Consensus Center will host a conference in our capital , San José , inspired by the 2004 Copenhagen Consensus summit . 
At that previous meeting , a panel of the world &apos;s leading economic thinkers was challenged to answer this question : if an extra $ 50 billion were spent improving the state of the world , how could the money be allocated to achieve the most good possible ? 
Those analysts realized that most , if not all , of the solutions to the world &apos;s biggest challenges depend on local or regional contexts . 
Therefore , the San José event will replace a global outlook with a regional one , with a new panel of experts focusing on the biggest challenges facing Latin America and the Caribbean . 
The challenges fall into ten categories - a familiar list of key issues in this part of the world : democracy , education , employment , the environment , fiscal problems , health , infrastructure , poverty and inequality , public administration , and crime . 
The experts will face obvious restrictions . 
Our resources are scarce . 
We must choose between various good ideas , however difficult this may be . 
The panel will produce a prioritized list of solutions that can serve as a set of guidelines for regional policymakers , helping us to be both ambitious and realistic . 
The &quot; Consulta de San José , &quot; as the event has been dubbed , will produce practical ideas that leaders can implement , and help us to identify and promote cost-efficient initiatives . 
Most importantly , however , it will serve to emphasize the importance of collective action . 
Working together with a genuine sense of regional community is a challenge in itself , but one well worth addressing . 
It has been said that &quot; good fences make good neighbors . &quot; 
There is undeniable wisdom in those words , but it is time to reevaluate what &quot; good fences &quot; really are . 
In today &apos;s world , they must be low enough for us to shake our neighbor &apos;s hand , understand his problems as we do our own , and find feasible solutions . 
They must be built with the knowledge that no fence , wall , or even an ocean or a continent can truly divide us from the problems of others . 
This is the spirit of the upcoming conference . 
I hope that spirit will spread far beyond San José , and that other regions will join us in recognizing that while our borders may define our territories , having the courage to reach across them defines our character - and , ultimately , our future success or failure .
