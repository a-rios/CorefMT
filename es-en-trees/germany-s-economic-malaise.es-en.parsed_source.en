Germany \ u0027s Economic Malaise 
A month before his re-election last month , Chancellor Gerhard Schröder seemed a certain loser . 
People resented his failure to keep his promise from 1998 to reduce unemployment . 
Now , with Schröder back in power , it &apos;s Germany &apos;s economy that seems the certain loser . 
Chancellor Schröder &apos;s job , as everyone now recognizes , was saved by floods in eastern Germany and his opportunistic crusade against America &apos;s Iraq policy . 
Each allowed him to preen successfully as a crisis manager . 
But the price of switching the terms of the debate away from economics is that the Chancellor now lacks a mandate to undertake serious labor market and other reforms . 
Indeed , Mr. Schröder committed himself strongly to trade union demands during his campaign . 
At the beginning of his first term , Schröder appeared to be a modern social democrat who understood business . 
When he ousted his first finance minister , Oskar Lafontaine , Germans became optimistic about reform and an economic upswing . 
Those hopes have vanished . 
Germany &apos;s vital small and medium-size businesses - the famous &quot; mittelstand &quot;  - has not only lost its dynamism , but investment in this sector is grinding to a halt . 
Together with today &apos;s weak consumer demand , this is a recipe for economic malaise . 
Equally troubling , Schröder embraced the misguided reform proposals put forward by the &quot; Hartz Commission , &quot; a panel of representatives from industrial and trade union interest groups . 
Its proposals are based on the illusion that a key factor in German unemployment is an ineffective labor market bureaucracy that fails to match those searching for jobs with the many jobs on offer . 
In reality , German unemployment is primarily a problem of a lack of jobs for low-skilled workers . 
Germany &apos;s welfare system effectively creates a minimum wage for the low skilled that is so far above the market price that it effectively prices such workers out of jobs . 
Implementing the &quot; Hartz Reforms &quot; has now become a primary government commitment that will distract attention and political will from the reforms that are really needed , namely an overhaul of Germany &apos;s social support system . 
Making Germany &apos;s economic prospects even gloomier is a looming round of tax hikes . 
An increase in gasoline taxes is set for January 2003 . 
Income tax relief due in 2003 has been postponed . 
Post-election talk abounds about higher wealth taxes , business taxes , and an increase in value-added tax - precisely the opposite of what Germany &apos;s economy needs . 
Tax hikes will not solve the government &apos;s fiscal problems , because weakening growth ultimately means less tax revenues . 
Finance Minister Eichel &apos;s policy is bound to become as erratic as the fiscal policies pursued by the last Kohl government . 
Efforts to find new revenues will chase spending cuts that in recent years have led to a decline in public-sector investment and education spending and a shift in responsibility for welfare spending from the federal to local governments . 
Eichel &apos;s commitment to balancing the budget is certainly important , but balancing the budget is no substitute for a medium and long-term strategic perspective for fiscal policy that promotes sustainable growth and recognizes the need to invest in Germany &apos;s ailing education system . 
In many German schools today the youngest teachers are well beyond their mid-forties , while universities find it increasingly hard to attract young researchers and faculty . 
Europe &apos;s experience over the past 10 years teaches that fiscal consolidation must be supported by growth-friendly tax and spending policies . 
Both spending and taxes must be used to strengthen the incentives to work , invest , and innovate . 
Even if Schröder wants to push for reform , his political position will make such efforts difficult . 
His thin majority in the lower house of the Bundestag faces an upper house dominated by the opposition Christian Democratic Union / Christian Social Union ( CDU / CSU ) . 
So any proposal will be subject to tricky negotiations and the need to cater to the special interests of länder governments , further reducing the prospect of serious reforms being undertaken . 
This last point has broader implications . 
Germany &apos;s political center , where elections are won and lost , remains undefined and unstable concerning policy priorities . 
So long as the campaign &apos;s focus was on economics , Schröder &apos;s government was a clear loser . 
When the focus shifted to flood relief and foreign affairs , a majority in the center embraced Schröder &apos;s disregard of international commitments and alliances . 
This suggests that a majority of Germans still do not yet perceive economic weakness as more important than other , more short-term issues . 
It also signals , correctly , that both main opposition parties did not appreciate the implications of Schröder &apos;s victory in 1998 . 
So neither the CDU / CSU nor their liberal allies , the Free Democrats , offered convincing policy prescriptions for dealing with Germany &apos;s economic problems . 
Indeed , Edmund Stoiber &apos;s economic policies as premier of Bavaria were ( and are ) no less interventionist than those of Schröder . 
The opposition &apos;s main campaign claim was a suggestion that the right is more competent than the left in managing the economy . 
But this was merely rhetoric . 
The right &apos;s lack of clear alternative policies made it easy for voters to turn back to the Chancellor when he decided not to talk about the economy . 
The next four years will challenge both the government and opposition . 
Chancellor Schröder will be confronted by the need finally to address Germany &apos;s real economic problems . 
The CDU / CSU and the FDP will be forced to present convincing alternatives to Schröder &apos;s policies . 
Until one side or the other acts decisively , Germany will remain economically weak and politically unpredictable .
