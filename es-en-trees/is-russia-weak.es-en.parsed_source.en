Is Russia Weak ? 
MOSCOW - Western leaders and observers persistently repeat , like a mantra , that Russia is &quot; weak . &quot; 
This judgment is based on a flawed comparison between Russia and the Soviet Union -though one that is also popular in Russia itself . 
Measured by Soviet standards , Russia has weakened . 
But , as former United States National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft noted , Russia still &quot; has enormous capacities to influence the US security strategy in any country . &quot; 
A country with such influence over a military superpower cannot be considered weak . 
In fact , the issue is not Russia &apos;s strength per se , but whether Russia intelligently concentrates and applies it . 
The new Russia has transcended its Soviet identity and managed to put down uprisings in the post-Soviet space as far away as Tajikistan . 
It has dealt with a new generation of security threats on its own territory - most prominently Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev - and prevented them from turning into a global force like al-Qaeda . 
Moreover , Russia has helped other new nations in Eastern Europe create their own identities . 
Does this not demonstrate Russia &apos;s global know-how ? 
Is it not a contribution to international security ? 
The US has recognized the Russian factor in post-Soviet state-building processes . 
Russia has not been the only beneficiary of its activities in the Caucasus , especially since 2000 . 
By bringing recalcitrant minorities into a new security consensus , Russia helped transform local ethnic conflict into a constructive process of nation-building . 
So Russia &apos;s claim to being a central element in Eurasian security , on par with the US and the European Union , is not the blustering of a spent Leviathan . 
Rather , it is a demand for a fair international legal order . 
The debate about whether the US should allow Russia to have &quot; special interests &quot; in Eastern Europe - renewed by Russia &apos;s opposition to America &apos;s proposed missile-defense installations in the Czech Republic and Poland - is pointless . 
Russia &apos;s interests are by necessity becoming global . 
The agenda of US-Russian relations includes issues such as treaties on the reduction of strategic weapons and on nuclear non-proliferation , NATO , Afghanistan , Iran , Central Asia , North Korea , and the post-Soviet space . 
These are all global , not local , issues . 
Russia can be effective in dealing with these issues only if it becomes a competent global actor . Yet many assume that world politics should be designed to bypass Russia . 
Everywhere Russians are expected to support something without participating in creating it . 
We are supposed to help stabilize the region around Afghanistan , for example , but only in order to create a &quot; greater Central Asia &quot; that will not include Russia . 
It is clear that modern Russia lacks global &quot; status &quot; in the Soviet sense . 
But the US has also been unable to achieve the global status of a &quot; Yalta superstate . &quot; 
America &apos;s global military power is undisputed , although it is used with decreasing frequency . 
Sprawled over 11 time zones between the EU and the US , of which five border China , it is impossible to expect Russia to remain merely a regional power . 
A state that is involved in three global regions ( Europe , Central Asia , and the Far East , not to mention the Arctic ) and borders several others cannot be considered &quot; regional . &quot; 
Moreover , because the regions in which Russia has interests face a number of problems , it must seek influence over the strategies for these regions pursued of other powers of various sizes , from China and the US , to the EU and Iran . 
Russia is expected to act in ways that are beneficial to US and Western interests . 
But it is in America &apos;s interest to enhance Russia &apos;s capacity to act - in other words , to strengthen a globally competent Russia . 
This would be a Russia that acts in pursuit of its own interests - the same way that the US and the EU act . 
Americans sometimes suggest that the Russians have a hidden strategic agenda . 
But the consensus that Vladimir Putin has created in Russia since 2000 is more than a question of interests ; it is a value-based reality . 
It is based on the possibility of a free life in a secure environment - something that Americans take for granted . 
For many years , we had to deal with the problem of Russia &apos;s very existence rather than that of the quality of its governance . 
Putin &apos;s consensus made it possible to resolve both problems without foreign assistance and interference . 
Now , in order to solve other problems , we need to go beyond Russia .
