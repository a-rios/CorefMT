A Russian Spring ? 
PARIS - Russia is not Egypt . 
And Moscow is not on the eve of revolution as Cairo was less than a year ago . 
Indeed , Russia &apos;s powerful have at their disposal assets that former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s regime lacked . 
As an energy superpower , Russia can open its coffers to appease , at least in part , the humiliation that it has inflicted on its citizens by falsifying the country &apos;s recent legislative election results . 
And not all Russians are in the streets . 
We should beware of the &quot; zoom effect , &quot; which made many people believe that the young protesters of Cairo &apos;s Tahrir Square were fully representative of Egyptian society . 
They were not . 
Rural Egypt , like rural Russia , is much more conservative than the young elites who seize the world &apos;s imagination with their protests and embrace of modern social media . 
Furthermore , Mubarak was old and sick , and no longer enjoyed the trust of his people . 
Vladimir Putin , by contrast , exudes energy and health , and may still reassure many segments of Russian society whose main concern is their country &apos;s glory rather than its citizens &quot; happiness . 
Yet Putin may be overplaying the macho card so excessively that it could backfire and contribute to his isolation from Russia &apos;s urban and more educated voters . 
But , even if the tens of thousands of demonstrators are unlikely to threaten the survival of Putin &apos;s regime , the Kremlin would be wise to take them seriously . 
The protesters &quot; trademark so far has been moderation and restraint ; nothing would be more dangerous than violent repression . 
Beyond the issue of violence , the Russian authorities would take a huge historical risk by failing to register the public &apos;s growing alienation . 
Sheltered physically and metaphorically by the Kremlin &apos;s high walls , and having progressively lost contact with the living conditions of ordinary people ( if they ever had any ) , Russia &apos;s leaders seem to consider their lifestyle to be both normal and eternal . 
From the standpoint of condemning elite behavior , Russian protesters evoke , at least partly , the actors of the Arab revolution . 
In their denunciation of &quot; Soviet electoral practices , &quot; they reject the combination of despotism and corruption that characterized Soviet power yesterday and Russian power today - rhetoric familiar from Arab revolutionaries . 
As young Arabs told the rulers of Libya , Egypt , Tunisia , Syria , Yemen , and other Arab countries , this new generation of Russians is telling Putin : &quot; Get Out ! &quot; 
But most participants hold few illusions about the efficacy of their protest . 
They want to express to Russia &apos;s rulers the extent of their frustration and determination . 
They may not expect regime change , but they expect at least some minimal reforms . 
Above all , they want to set limits on Putin &apos;s power . 
But their protest &apos;s ironic consequence may be that the more moderate of the two figures at the summit of Russian politics , Dmitri Medvedev , will not return to the post of prime minister , as had been planned . 
A game of political musical chairs would simply be too much in the eyes of too many Russians . 
The protests have caught the Kremlin &apos;s masters , as well as the majority of Russia &apos;s citizens , by surprise . 
They failed to recognize that globalization - particularly the global information revolution - has made the world more transparent and interdependent than ever . 
The protesters of Madrid were inspired by those of Cairo , and were themselves a source of inspiration from New York to Tel Aviv - and , subsequently , to Moscow . 
A lesson emerges : with the deepening of the economic crisis , on the one hand , and instant global connectivity , on the other , what was accepted yesterday is regarded as intolerable today . 
That applies to Russia , too . 
For a long time , Russia has perceived itself as a &quot; White Africa . &quot; 
The average life expectancy of Russian men , slightly below 60 , is more African than European ( or even Asian , for the most part ) . 
The corrupt enrichment of so many Russian elites mimics the disastrous habits of many of their African counterparts . 
But this comparison has limits . 
Despite its many problems , Africa today has become a continent of hope . 
Its population is exploding , as are its economic-growth rates . 
Senegalese firms seek to help their Spanish business partners , while Portugal extends an almost royal welcome to the leaders of their former colony , newly oil-rich Angola . 
Africa is on the rise , while Russia is on the decline . 
The democratic idealism that accompanied the fall of communism 20 years ago is gone , but the &quot; imperial pride &quot; recovered in part during the Putin years may not be enough to compensate for the contempt with which the Russian state treats its citizens . 
Russia &apos;s demonstrators &quot; message is simple : &quot; Too much corruption , disdain , and inequality is too much . &quot; 
Russia , like the Arab world , wants modernity .
