India &apos;s Democracy at 60 
At midnight on August 15 , 1947 , a new nation was born on a subcontinent ripped apart by a bloody partition . 
Independent India came into being as flames blazed across the land , corpse-laden trains crossed the new frontier with Pakistan , and weary refugees abandoned everything to seek a new life . 
A less propitious start for a fledgling nation could scarcely be imagined . 
Yet , six decades later , the India that emerged from the wreckage of the British Raj is the world &apos;s largest democracy , poised after years of rapid economic growth to take its place as one of the giants of the twenty-first century . 
A country whose very survival seemed in doubt at its founding offers striking lessons in constructing , against all odds , a working democracy . 
No other country embraces such an extraordinary profusion of ethnic groups , mutually incomprehensible languages , religions , and cultural practices , as well as variations of topography , climate , and levels of economic development . 
In 1947 , India &apos;s leaders faced a country with a million dead , 13 million displaced , billions of rupees worth of property damage , and the wounds of sectarian violence still bleeding . 
Given this , and the challenges of administering a new country , integrating the &quot; princely states &quot; into the Indian Union , and reorganizing the divided armed forces , they could have been forgiven for demanding dictatorial powers . 
But India made a strength out of its major weakness . 
To the American motto , &quot; E Pluribus Unum , &quot; India could only counter , &quot; E Pluribus Pluribum . &quot; 
Instead of suppressing its diversity in the name of national unity , India acknowledged its pluralism in its institutional arrangements : all groups , faiths , tastes , and ideologies survive and contend for their place in the sun . 
This wasn &apos;t always easy . 
India suffered caste conflicts , clashes over the rights of different linguistic groups , religious riots ( mainly between Hindus and Muslims ) , and separatist threats . 
Despite many stresses and strains , India has a remained a freewheeling multi-party democracy - corrupt and inefficient , perhaps , but nonetheless flourishing . 
It helped that India &apos;s founding fathers , from Mahatma Gandhi on , were convinced democrats . 
India &apos;s first and longest-serving prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , spent his political career instilling in his people the habits of democracy : disdain for dictators , respect for parliamentary procedures , and abiding faith in the constitutional system . 
As prime minister , Nehru carefully nurtured the country &apos;s infant democratic institutions by showing them respect , even deference . 
For example , on the one occasion that he publicly criticized a judge , he apologized the next day and wrote an abject letter to the India &apos;s Chief Justice . 
Though there was no serious challenger to his authority , Nehru never forgot that he derived his power from India &apos;s people , to whom he remained astonishingly accessible . 
By his personal example , democratic values became so entrenched that when his own daughter , Indira Gandhi , suspended India &apos;s freedoms in 1975 with a 21-month State of Emergency , she felt compelled to return to the Indian people for vindication . 
Having imbibed the most important of her father &apos;s values , she held a free election , which she overwhelmingly lost . 
Though Indian politics is hardly immune to the appeal of sectarianism , its people have come to accept the idea of India as one land embracing many differences of caste , creed , color , culture , cuisine , conviction , costume , and custom , yet still rallying around a democratic consensus . 
The heart of that consensus is the simple principle that you don &apos;t need to agree all the time - except on the ground rules about how you can disagree . 
India has survived all the challenges that have beset it for 60 years because it has maintained a consensus on how to manage without consensus . 
For example , India permits all religions to flourish while ensuring that none is privileged by the state . 
This includes the granting of group rights , under which Muslims are governed by their own Personal Law , distinct from the common civil code . 
If America is a melting-pot , then India is a thali , a selection of sumptuous dishes in different bowls . 
Each tastes different , and does not necessarily mix with the next , but all belong on the same plate . 
No one speaks seriously any more of the danger of disintegration . 
Separatist movements in far-flung places like Tamil Nadu and Mizoram have been quietly defused by a simple formula : yesterday &apos;s secessionists become today &apos;s chief ministers ( the equivalent of provincial or state governors ) and tomorrow &apos;s opposition leaders . 
Moreover , democracy in India is not an elite preoccupation , but matters most to the underprivileged masses . 
Whereas in the United States , a majority of the poor do not vote , - turnout in Harlem was 23 % in the last presidential election - in India the poor turn out in great numbers . 
As a result , the explosive potential of caste division also has been channeled through the ballot box , with the lowest of the low attaining high office . 
Mayawati , an &quot; untouchable &quot; woman , has ruled India &apos;s most populous state , Uttar Pradesh , as Chief Minister three times , and now enjoys a secure majority . 
More generally , the logic of the electoral marketplace means that no single communal identity can dominate others . 
Three years ago , India , a country that is 81 % Hindu , saw a Roman Catholic political leader ( Sonia Gandhi ) make way for a Sikh ( Manmohan Singh ) , who was sworn in by a Muslim ( President Abdul Kalam ) . 
By contrast , the world &apos;s oldest democracy , the US , has yet to elect a president who is not white , male , and Christian . 
Democracy has sustained an India that safeguards the common space available to each identity . 
That idea has knit together a country that many thought would not survive , and whose 60th birthday is therefore well worth celebrating .
