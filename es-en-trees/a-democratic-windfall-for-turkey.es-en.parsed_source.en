A Democratic Windfall for Turkey ? 
Turkey &apos;s seeming fall from grace with the US may turn out to be a blessing in disguise . 
The Iraq war and the tortured diplomacy that led up to it may help resolve Turkey &apos;s conflict between its &quot; strategic alliance &quot; with America and its drive to join the EU . 
The elections last November that brought the Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) to power were preceded by a dispute between the members of the then-ruling coalition over enacting the reforms demanded by the EU . 
Some liberal elements of that &quot; secular &quot; coalition resigned from the government and joined with the Islamists to push the reforms through parliament . 
After coming to power , the AKP &apos;s leaders , former Islamists who had reinvented themselves as &quot; conservative democrats , &quot; energetically engaged with the US , the EU , and the UN on issues ranging from Cyprus to Iraq , from Kurdish language rights to other human rights issues within Turkey . 
Having suffered the oppressive practices of Turkey &apos;s &quot; secular &quot; state and recognizing that human rights must be protected across-the-board , the AKP emerged as a credible interlocutor with the West . 
The US , preoccupied with the supposed specter of a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; between Islam and the West , saw the AKP &apos;s modern , westernized face as an opportunity and urged the EU to admit Turkey . 
Today , both &quot; conservative democrats &quot; and liberals advocate passing all the reforms needed to gain accession to the EU , while opponents include extreme nationalists , of both left and right , as well as some elements of the &quot; secular &quot; establishment . 
The Europeans could have tipped the balance decisively in favor of the reformers by finally rewarding the efforts of the pro-EU Turks at last December &apos;s summit of EU leaders . 
Instead , the EU kept Turkey waiting yet again , putting off formal negotiations that , in any case , may take years to complete . 
Europe &apos;s persistent reluctance puts the Turks in a quandary . 
The Americans want full EU membership for Turkey - a longstanding NATO member and close American ally - while Europeans complain about the Turkish military &apos;s domestic political role . 
The paradox is that , by maintaining a political distance and thus limiting Turkey &apos;s options , Europe may end up reinforcing Turkey &apos;s status as a military outpost of the US . 
At least , that was how things were shaping up prior to the war in Iraq . 
Then , despite massive US pressure , Turkey &apos;s parliament unexpectedly rejected the government &apos;s proposal to allow US troops in Turkey to launch an invasion from Turkish territory . 
Turkey &apos;s refusal to grant the Americans access to military bases on its territory effectively ruled out a northern front in the war . 
The Turkish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful solution to the crisis , an effort no current EU member could have contemplated . 
Parliament &apos;s rejection of US troops powerfully refutes suggestions that Turkey was primarily concerned about the size of the American aid package on offer as an inducement to cooperate . 
Suggestions that characterized the vote as revealing the government &apos;s true &quot; Islamic &quot; character ignore the fact that the only opposition party in parliament , the Republican People &apos;s Party - founded by Atat√ºrk and still fully &quot; secularist &quot;  - voted against the plan . 
Likewise , other elements of Turkey &apos;s secular establishment , including the President and the military leadership , either opposed or were lukewarm , at best , to the idea of war in Iraq . 
Turkey &apos;s military initially remained silent on the issue , uncharacteristically watching the civilian political process unfold . 
By contrast , the military had earlier publicly criticized AKP initiatives on Cyprus . 
Their silence on Iraq reflected their apprehension about unwanted alternatives : either support the US plan and risk encouraging Kurdish moves toward an independent state , or oppose the Americans and jeopardize a critical strategic relationship . 
They chose to defer to the civilian leadership and to parliament , which , in voting down the US plan , reflected overwhelming public sentiment against the war . 
Only after the vote did the Chief of Staff publicly endorse the original proposal to bring in American troops . 
In fact , the allegedly Islamic party had skilfully managed to negotiate with an unrelenting US , consult with the Turkish military and President , and share all information with the public and parliament . 
Walking a fine line in what was essentially a lose-lose situation , the party leadership laid out the stakes clearly and judiciously left the final decision to parliament . 
The outcome was a victory for Turkish democracy and recognized as such internationally . 
After the US military action in Iraq , the tables may be turning in surprising ways . 
As America establishes itself in Iraq , Turkey &apos;s geopolitical military significance may decline . 
Yet the declared American aim of building a Muslim democracy in Iraq will only enhance Turkey &apos;s symbolic importance as a role model . 
This shift in Turkey &apos;s strategic role may also be reflected in a new domestic balance between the military and the forces pushing for reform . 
With careful management , Turkey may find itself drawing closer to Europe , while rebuilding its relationship with America .
