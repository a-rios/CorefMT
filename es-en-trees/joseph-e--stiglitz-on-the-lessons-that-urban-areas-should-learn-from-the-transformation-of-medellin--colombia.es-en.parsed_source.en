A Light Unto Cities 
NEW YORK - Last month , a remarkable gathering occurred in Medellín , Colombia . 
Some 22,000 people came together to attend the World Urban Forum and discuss the future of cities . 
The focus was on creating &quot; cities for life &quot; - that is , on promoting equitable development in the urban environments in which a majority of the world &apos;s citizens already live , and in which two thirds will reside by the year 2050 . 
The location itself was symbolic : Once notorious for its drug gangs , Medellín now has a well-deserved reputation as one of the most innovative cities in the world . 
The tale of the city &apos;s transformation holds important lessons for urban areas everywhere . 
In the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , cartel bosses like the infamous Pablo Escobar ruled Medellín &apos;s streets and controlled its politics . 
The source of Escobar &apos;s power was not just the hugely profitable international cocaine trade ( fueled by demand in the United States ) , but also extreme inequality in Medellín and Colombia . 
On the steep Andean slopes of the valley that cradles the city , vast slums , virtually abandoned by the government , provided a ready supply of recruits for the cartels . 
In the absence of public services , Escobar won the hearts and minds of Medellín &apos;s poorest with his largesse - even as he terrorized the city . 
One can hardly recognize those slums today . 
In the poor neighborhood of Santo Domingo , the city &apos;s new Metrocable system , consisting of three lines of aerial gondolas , serves residents hundreds of vertical feet up a mountainside , ending their isolation from the city center . 
The commute is now minutes , and the social and economic barriers between the informal settlements and the rest of the city are on their way to being broken down . 
The problems of the city &apos;s poor neighborhoods have not been erased , but the benefits that the infrastructure improvements have brought are brilliantly evident in the well-kept houses , murals , and soccer fields perched near the gondola stations . 
The cable cars are only the most iconic of the projects for which Medellín last year won Harvard University &apos;s Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design , the most prestigious award in the field . 
Beginning with the mayoralty of Sergio Fajardo ( now the governor of Medellín &apos;s department , Antioquia ) , who took office in 2004 , the city has made major efforts to transform its slums , improve education , and promote development . 
( The current mayor , Aníbal Gaviria , has affirmed his commitment to continuing on this path . ) 
Medellín constructed avant-garde public buildings in areas that were the most run down , provided house paint to citizens living in poor districts , and cleaned up and improved the streets - all in the belief that if you treat people with dignity , they will value their surroundings and take pride in their communities . 
And that faith has been more than borne out . 
Throughout the world , cities are both the locus and the focus of society &apos;s major debates , and for good reason . 
When individuals live in close quarters , they cannot escape major societal problems : growing inequality , environmental degradation , and inadequate public investment . 
The forum reminded participants that livable cities require planning - a message at odds with prevailing attitudes in much of the world . 
But without planning and government investment in infrastructure , public transportation and parks , and the provision of clean water and sanitation , cities won &apos;t be livable . 
And it is the poor who inevitably suffer the most from the absence of these public goods . 
Medellín holds some lessons for America , too . 
The conference went beyond this , emphasizing that &quot; livable cities &quot; are not enough . 
We need to create urban areas in which individuals can flourish and innovate . 
It is no accident that the Enlightenment - which led in turn to the fastest and largest increases in living standards in human history - unfolded in cities . 
New thinking is a natural consequence of high population density , provided the right conditions are met - conditions that include public spaces in which people can interact and culture can thrive , and a democratic ethos that welcomes and encourages public participation . 
A key theme of the forum was the emerging consensus on the need for environmentally , socially , and economically sustainable development . 
All of these aspects of sustainability are intertwined and complementary , and cities provide the context in which this is most clear . 
One of the biggest obstacles to achieving sustainability is inequality . 
Our economies , our democracies , and our societies pay a high price for the growing gap between the rich and poor . 
And perhaps the most invidious aspect of the widening income and wealth gap in so many countries is that it is deepening inequality of opportunity . 
Some cities have shown that these widely observed patterns are not the result of immutable economic laws . 
Even in the advanced country with the most inequality - the US - some cities , like San Francisco and San Jose , are comparable to the best-performing economies in terms of equality of opportunity . 
With political gridlock afflicting so many national governments around the world , forward-thinking cities are becoming a beacon of hope . 
A divided US seems incapable of addressing its alarming increase in inequality . 
But in New York City , Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected on the promise of doing something about it . 
While there are limits to what can be done at the local level - national taxation , for instance , is far more important than municipal taxes - cities can help ensure the availability of affordable housing . 
And they have a special responsibility to provide high-quality public education and public amenities for all , regardless of income . 
Medellín and the World Urban Forum have shown that this is not just a pipe dream . 
Another world is possible ; we need only the political will to pursue it .
