States of Risk 
LONDON - The Great Recession of 2008-2009 was triggered by excessive debt accumulation and leverage on the part of households , financial institutions , and even the corporate sector in many advanced economies . 
While there is much talk about de-leveraging as the crisis wanes , the reality is that private-sector debt ratios have stabilized at very high levels . 
By contrast , as a consequence of fiscal stimulus and socialization of part of the private sector &apos;s losses , there is now a massive re-leveraging of the public sector . 
Deficits in excess of 10 % of GDP can be found in many advanced economies , and debt-to-GDP ratios are expected to rise sharply - in some cases doubling in the next few years . 
As Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff &apos;s new book This Time is Different demonstrates , such balance-sheet crises have historically led to economic recoveries that are slow , anemic , and below-trend for many years . 
Sovereign-debt problems are another strong possibility , given the massive re-leveraging of the public sector . 
In countries that cannot issue debt in their own currency ( traditionally emerging-market economies ) , or that issue debt in their own currency but cannot independently print money ( as in the euro zone ) , unsustainable fiscal deficits often lead to a credit crisis , a sovereign default , or other coercive form of public-debt restructuring . 
In countries that borrow in their own currency and can monetize the public debt , a sovereign debt crisis is unlikely , but monetization of fiscal deficits can eventually lead to high inflation . 
Thus , the recent problems faced by Greece are only the tip of a sovereign-debt iceberg in many advanced economies ( and a smaller number of emerging markets ) . 
Bond-market vigilantes already have taken aim at Greece , Spain , Portugal , the United Kingdom , Ireland , and Iceland , pushing government bond yields higher . 
Eventually they may take aim at other countries - even Japan and the United States - where fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path . 
In most advanced economies , aging populations - a serious problem in Europe and Japan -exacerbate the problem of fiscal sustainability , as falling population levels increase the burden of unfunded public-sector liabilities , particularly social-security and health-care systems . 
Low or negative population growth also implies lower potential economic growth and therefore worse debt-to-GDP dynamics and increasingly grave doubts about the sustainability of public-sector debt . 
The dilemma is that , whereas fiscal consolidation is necessary to prevent an unsustainable increase in the spread on sovereign bonds , the short-run effects of raising taxes and cutting government spending tend to be contractionary . 
Indeed , this was the trap faced by Argentina in 1998-2001 , when needed fiscal contraction exacerbated recession and eventually led to default . 
In countries like the euro-zone members , a loss of external competitiveness , caused by tight monetary policy and a strong currency , erosion of long-term comparative advantage relative to emerging markets , and wage growth in excess of productivity growth , impose further constraints on the resumption of growth . 
A vicious circle of public-finance deficits , current-account gaps , worsening external-debt dynamics , and stagnating growth can then set in . 
Eventually , this can lead to default on euro-zone members &quot; public and foreign debt , as well as exit from the monetary union by fragile economies unable to adjust and reform fast enough . 
But if a country is effectively insolvent rather than just illiquid , such &quot; bailouts &quot; cannot prevent eventual default and devaluation ( or exit from a monetary union ) because the international lender of last resort eventually will stop financing an unsustainable debt dynamic , as occurred Argentina ( and in Russia in 1998 ) . 
Cleaning up high private-sector debt and lowering public-debt ratios by growth alone is particularly hard if a balance-sheet crisis leads to an anemic recovery . 
At the end of the day , resolving private-sector leverage problems by fully socializing private losses and re-leveraging the public sector is risky . 
At best , taxes will eventually be raised and spending cut , with a negative effect on growth ; at worst , the outcome may be direct capital levies ( default ) or indirect ones ( inflation ) . 
Unsustainable private-debt problems must be resolved by defaults , debt reductions , and conversion of debt into equity . 
If , instead , private debts are excessively socialized , the advanced economies will face a grim future : serious sustainability problems with their public , private , and foreign debt , together with crippled prospects for economic growth .
