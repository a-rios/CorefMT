The Moral Economy of Debt 
LONDON - Every economic collapse brings a demand for debt forgiveness . 
The incomes needed to repay loans have evaporated , and assets posted as collateral have lost value . 
Creditors demand their pound of flesh ; debtors clamor for relief . 
Consider Strike Debt , an offshoot of the Occupy movement , which calls itself &quot; a nationwide movement of debt resisters fighting for economic justice and democratic freedom . &quot; 
Its Web site argues that &quot; &#91; w &#93; ith stagnant wages , systemic unemployment , and public service cuts &quot; people are being forced into debt in order to obtain the most basic necessities of life , leading them to &quot; surrender &#91; their &#93; futures to the banks . &quot; 
One of Strike Debt &apos;s initiatives , &quot; Rolling Jubilee , &quot; crowd-sources funds to buy up and extinguish debt , a process that it calls &quot; collective refusal . &quot; 
The group &apos;s progress has been impressive , raising more than $ 700,000 so far and extinguishing debt worth almost $ 18.6 million . 
It is the existence of a secondary debt market that enables Rolling Jubilee to buy debt so cheaply . 
Financial institutions that have come to doubt their borrowers &quot; ability to repay sell the debt to third parties at knock-down prices , often for as little as five cents on the dollar . 
Buyers then attempt to profit by recouping some or all of the debt from the borrowers . 
The US student-loan provider Sallie Mae admitted that it sells repackaged debt for as little as 15 cents on the dollar . 
To draw attention to the often-nefarious practices of debt collectors , Rolling Jubilee recently canceled student debt for 2,761 students of Everest College , a for-profit school whose parent company , Corinthian Colleges , is being sued by the US government for predatory lending . 
Everest College &apos;s loan portfolio was valued at almost $ 3.9 million . 
Rolling Jubilee bought it for $ 106,709.48 , or about three cents on the dollar . 
But that is a drop in the ocean . 
In the US alone , students owe more than $ 1 trillion , or around 6 % of GDP . 
And the student population is just one of many social groups that lives on debt . 
Indeed , throughout the world , the economic downturn of 2008-2009 increased the burden of private and public debt alike - to the point that the public-private distinction became blurred . 
In a recent speech in Chicago , Irish President Michael D. Higgins explained how private debt became sovereign debt : &quot; As a consequence of the need to borrow so as to finance current expenditure and , above all , as a result of the blanket guarantee extended to the main Irish banks &quot; assets and liabilities , Ireland &apos;s general government debt increased from 25 % of GDP in 2007 to 124 % in 2013 . &quot; 
The Irish government &apos;s aim , of course , was to save the banking system . 
But the unintended consequence of the bailout was to shatter confidence in the government &apos;s solvency . 
In the eurozone , Ireland , Greece , Portugal , and Cyprus all had to restructure their sovereign debt to avoid outright default . 
Rising debt / GDP ratios cast a pall over fiscal policy , and became the main justification for austerity policies that prolonged the slump . 
None of this is new . 
Creditor-debtor conflict has been the stuff of politics since Babylonian times . 
Orthodoxy has always upheld the sacred rights of the creditor ; political necessity has frequently demanded relief for the debtor . 
Which side wins in any situation depends on the extent of debtor distress and the strength of the opposing creditor-debtor coalitions . 
Morality has always been the intellectual coin of these conflicts . 
Creditors , asserting their right to be repaid in full , historically have created as many legal and political obstacles to default as possible , insisting on harsh sanctions - garnishment of income , for example , and , at the extreme , imprisonment or even slavery - for borrowers &quot; failure to honor their debt obligations . 
Governments that incurred debt in costly wars have been expected to set aside annual &quot; sinking funds &quot; for repayment . 
Morality , however , has not been entirely on the side of the creditor . 
In New Testament Greek , debt means &quot; sin . &quot; 
But , though it might be sinful to go into debt , Matthew 6 : 12 supports absolution : &quot; forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors . &quot; 
Widespread social resistance to creditors &quot; claims on debtors &quot; property for non-payment has meant that &quot; foreclosure &quot; has rarely been carried to extremes . 
The position of debtors was further strengthened by the prohibition of usury - charging unreasonably high interest on money . 
Interest-rate caps were abolished in Britain only in 1835 ; the near-zero central-bank rates prevailing since 2009 are a current example of efforts to protect borrowers . 
The truth of the matter , as David Graeber points out in his majestic Debt : The First 5,000 Years , is that that the creditor-debtor relationship embodies no iron law of morality ; rather , it is a social relationship that always must be negotiated . 
When quantitative precision and an unyielding approach to debt obligations are the rule , conflict and penury soon follow . 
In an effort to stem recurrent debt crises , traditional societies embraced the &quot; Law of Jubilee , &quot; a ceremonial wiping clean of the slate . 
&quot; The Law of Jubilee , &quot; writes Graeber , &quot; stipulated that all debts be automatically canceled &quot; in the Sabbath year &quot; ( that is , after seven years had passed ) , and that all who languished in bondage owing to such debts would be released . &quot; 
The Rolling Jubilee is a timely reminder of the continuing relevance of one of the oldest laws of social life . 
The moral of the tale is not , as Polonius instructed his son Laertes , &quot; neither a borrower nor a lender be . &quot; 
Without both , humanity might still be living in caves . 
Rather , we need to limit the supply of and demand for credit to what the economy is capable of producing . 
How to do this and maintain freedom of enterprise is one of the great unsettled questions of political economy .
