The German Scapegoat 
BRUSSELS - Could Germany , which accounts for 1 % of the world &apos;s population and less than 5 % of its GDP , actually be responsible for the sorry state of the global economy ? 
The US Treasury Department started the chorus with a report on currency manipulators that criticized Germany &apos;s current-account surplus . 
The European Commission added its voice last month , when it published its scorecard on macroeconomic imbalances and called for an in-depth analysis of the German surplus . 
The emphasis on Germany seems much more justified within the context of Europe . 
But , even there , Germany represents less than 30 % of eurozone GDP ( and less than one-quarter of output in the EU as a whole ) . 
Germany is important but not dominant . 
This focus on Germany also overlooks the fact that the country represents just the tip of a Teutonic iceberg : All northern European countries with a Germanic language are running a current-account surplus . 
Indeed , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Sweden , and Norway are all running surpluses that are larger as a proportion of GDP than Germany &apos;s . 
These small countries &quot; combined annual external surplus is more than $ 250 billion , slightly more than that of Germany alone . 
Moreover , their surpluses have been more persistent than those of Germany : ten years ago , Germany had a current-account deficit , while its linguistic kin were already running surpluses of a similar size as today . 
Over the last decade , this group of small countries has recorded a cumulative surplus larger than even that of China . 
Are all of these countries guilty of mercantilist policies ? 
Have all of them engaged in competitive wage restraint ? 
Much of the facile policy advice provided to correct the German surplus seems misguided when one examines the persistent surpluses of this diverse group of countries . 
Some , like Germany , are in the eurozone ( the Netherlands ) ; others have pegged their currency to the euro unilaterally ( Switzerland ) , while still others maintain a floating exchange rate ( Sweden ) . 
Within the eurozone , the counterpart to the German surpluses used to be the deficits of the peripheral countries ( mostly Spain , but also Portugal and Greece ) . 
This is no longer the case . 
Today , the counterpart to Teutonic excess saving is &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; dissaving : most English-language countries are running current-account deficits ( and have been doing so for some time ) . 
Together , the sum of the current-account deficits of the United States , the United Kingdom , and major Commonwealth countries amounts to more than $ 800 billion , or roughly 60 % of the global total of all external deficits . 
It is not surprising that national policymakers ( and media ) in major Anglophone countries are complaining about the German surplus . 
But action by Germany alone will have little impact on these countries &quot; fortunes , because their deficits are much larger . 
The key question is who would benefit if Germany started to import more . 
The peripheral eurozone countries account for only about 10 % of German imports , compared to almost 40 % for the other surplus countries in northern Europe . 
Stronger domestic demand in Germany would thus benefit these other surplus countries ( with low unemployment ) four times more than the peripheral countries ( with much higher unemployment ) . 
Other countries with a structural surplus , including Russia , China , and Japan , would also benefit more from stronger German demand than Spain or Greece would . 
The discussion of the German surplus thus confuses the issues in two ways . 
First , though the German economy and its surplus loom large in the context of Europe , an adjustment by Germany alone would benefit the eurozone periphery rather little . 
Second , in the global context , adjustment by Germany alone would benefit many countries only a little , while other surplus countries would benefit disproportionally . 
Adjustment by all northern European countries would have double the impact of any expansion of demand by Germany alone , owing to the high degree of integration among the &quot; Teutonic &quot; countries . 
This applies to both the European and global contexts . 
Coordination within the eurozone ( for example , through the excessive-imbalance procedure , which might now be applied to Germany ) seems largely insufficient if the aim is to help the peripheral countries . 
At the global level , the Anglophone deficit countries , too , would benefit much more if all of northern Europe increased its domestic demand . 
Germany has been an attractive target for external-deficit countries in Europe and beyond . 
But beating up on Germany alone appears to be the wrong way to get results .
