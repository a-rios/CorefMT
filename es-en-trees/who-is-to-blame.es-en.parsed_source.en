Who is to Blame ? 
PRINCETON - Now that the economic crisis looks less threatening ( at least for the moment ) , and forecasters are spying &quot; green shoots &quot; of recovery , an ever more encompassing blame game is unfolding . 
The financial crisis provides an apparently endless opportunity for unmasking deceit , malfeasance , and corruption . 
But we are not sure quite who and what should be unmasked . 
Leading bankers were initially the most obvious culprits . 
They presided over institutions that made large profits for a substantial period of time by mispricing risk , and then argued for public support on the grounds that they were too big to fail . 
They appeared arrogant and overpaid , and were easily demonized . 
But what about the political process ? 
Why were the banks not more closely controlled and better regulated ? 
It is not that politicians were &quot; bought &quot; in a simple sense ; rather , they convinced themselves that financial innovation opened the gate to greater general prosperity , increased home ownership , and , of course , popular support in elections . 
Governments are now vulnerable , and politicians are under attack almost everywhere . 
Administrations have collapsed in the Czech Republic , Hungary , Iceland , and Ireland . 
Riots and paralyzing strikes have crippled Thailand , France , and Greece . 
In Kuwait , the government dismissed parliament . 
Britain is convulsed by a scandal about parliamentary expenses that has no equivalent since the attacks on &quot; old corruption &quot; in the early nineteenth century . 
Recriminations after financial crises have a long history , and they recur in regular cycles . 
The stock exchange boom of the early 1870 &quot; s was followed by collapse in 1873 and a witch-hunt for those responsible . 
In 1907 , J.P. Morgan was first viewed as the savior of the market , and then as the enemy of the commonweal . 
In the 1930 &quot; s , bankers and finance ministers were accused . 
But for the rest of the twentieth century , the backlash cycle seemed to have stopped . 
Today the attacks are not limited to the political and financial establishment . 
Critics are trying to identify the ideas as well as the interests that were responsible for financial and economic dysfunction . 
In this respect , the contemporary crisis is unlike the historical analogies , in that it looks as if financial innovation was driven by a set of intellectual and even technological innovations . 
Since it is an economic crisis , most people seeking its intellectual roots are tempted to begin with economists , who , with a few exceptions , look particularly discredited . 
The founder of the rational expectations revolution , Robert Lucas , is endlessly quoted as having stated in 2003 in his presidential address to the American Economic Association that the &quot; central problem of depression-prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes , and has in fact been solved for many decades . &quot; 
It is also clear that academic economists had an impact on policy . 
Larry Summers , now the highly influential director of President Barack Obama &apos;s National Economic Council , concluded as a young economist that &quot; financial and monetary shocks are less important sources of depression than we had suspected . &quot; 
If the economy was foolproof , and if so many good policy options existed to deal with crisis and distress , there was less need to avoid mistakes . 
Things could always be set right retrospectively . 
Other academic disciplines have looked rather smugly at the public humiliation of their colleagues in economics . 
The non-mathematical appear to have their revenge , as the perils of over-reliance on complex symbolic notation and arcane formulae are relentlessly exposed . 
In fact , developments or fashions in other academic disciplines and also in the general culture contributed at least as much to a willingness to engage in absurd risks and to provide and accept valuations of complex and inherently unfathomable securities . 
The general cultural developments are sometimes termed post-modernism , which involves the replacement of reason by intuition , feeling , and allusion . 
But post-modernism has itself been generated by technology , with which it has a deeply ambiguous relationship . 
In contrast to a steam engine or an old-fashioned automobile , whose operations were easily comprehensible , modern automobiles or airplanes are so complicated that their operators have no idea how the technology they are using actually works . 
The Internet has created a world in which strict logic is less important than the juxtaposition of striking images . 
Post-modernism moves away from the rational culture of the so-called &quot; modern era . &quot; 
Many people are finding more analogies with medieval life , in which humans were surrounded by processes that they found difficult to comprehend . 
As a result , they thought they lived in a world populated by demons and mysterious forces . 
The recent era of global finance - perhaps we should speak of it as being past ? - differed from the financial surge of a century ago . 
Its cultural manifestations also appeared to be novel . 
It was playful , allusive , and edgy - in short , post-modern . 
It treated tradition and history not as a constraint , but as a source of ironic reference . 
At the era &apos;s height , major financial players built vastly expensive collections of highly abstract modern art . 
A post-modern neglect or disdain for reality generated the sense that the whole world was constantly shifting and malleable , and might be as transient and meaningless as stock quotations . 
An alliance was formed between financial experts who thought they were selling truly innovative ideas , a political elite that endorsed the philosophy of &quot; regulation lite , &quot; and a cultural climate that pushed experimentation and the rejection of traditional values . 
The result was that every sort of value - including financial values - came to be seen as arbitrary and fundamentally absurd . 
When incomprehension no longer produces new heights of prosperity , but rather economic collapse and failure , it is not surprising that it turns to anger . 
Finding out who is to blame becomes more and more like the late medieval and early modern search for witches : a way of making sense of a disorderly and hostile universe .
