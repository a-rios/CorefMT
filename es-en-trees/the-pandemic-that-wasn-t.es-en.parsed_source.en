The Pandemic That Wasn &apos;t 
PALO ALTO - Last June , the United Nations &quot; World Health Organization , responding to an outbreak of the H1N1 virus , or swine flu , boosted the pandemic alert to the highest level , Phase 6 , meaning that a pandemic was under way - the first time in 41 years that the organization had taken that declared step . 
But the outbreak appears to have ended less like the rogue wild boar that WHO bureaucrats predicted and more like a roasted pork tenderloin with apples and sage . 
In fact , the WHO repeatedly violated Sherlock Holmes &quot; warning , &quot; It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence . &quot; 
And the pandemic alert was doubly strange , given that ordinary seasonal flu sweeps the world annually , is invariably far more lethal than the currently circulating low-virulence H1N1 , and certainly meets the WHO &apos;s definition of a pandemic : infections over a wide geographic area and affecting a large proportion of the population . 
Ironically , the appearance of the H1N1 flu during the past nine months might be thought of as a net public-health benefit , because it appears to have suppressed , or at least supplanted , the far more virulent and lethal seasonal flu strains . 
During the second week of January , 3.7 % of Americans tested positive for the seasonal flu , compared to 11.5 % during the same week in 2009 . 
The official death toll worldwide from H1N1 is under 14,000 , while seasonal flu kills about 36,000 on average in the United States and hundreds of thousands elsewhere . 
Most flu and public-health experts consider the WHO to have been overly alarmist . 
The decision in April 2009 to raise the pandemic flu threat to the penultimate level , Phase 5 ( &quot; Pandemic Imminent &quot; ) , already raced far ahead of the accumulated data , so the Phase 6 declaration in June revealed the organization &apos;s paradigm to be fundamentally flawed . 
A warning system based solely on how widely a virus has spread , but that does not consider the nature and severity of the illness it causes , would classify as &quot; pandemics &quot; not only seasonal flu , but also the frequent but largely inconsequential outbreaks of virus-caused colds and gastroenteritis , for example . 
( The WHO has never explained why these obvious examples do not meet their criteria . ) 
False alarms make the &quot; pandemic under way &quot; designation almost meaningless and diminish its usefulness . 
And that , in turn , has important consequences : as Jack Fisher , a professor of surgery at the University of California , San Diego , School of Medicine , observed , &quot; Keep crying &quot; wolf , &quot; and WHO can expect lower than customary compliance with flu vaccine advisories next fall . &quot; 
Worse , imagine what would happen when we encounter a genuinely dangerous new pathogen , such as a strain of H5N1 avian flu ( which in its current form has a mortality rate more than 100 times higher than H1N1 ) that is easily transmissible between humans . 
The UN &apos;s false alarms also have had more immediate negative effects . 
Egyptian public-health authorities overreacted and ordered the slaughter of all pigs in the country . 
In addition to the direct economic losses , because the pigs were no longer available to consume much of the garbage produced in Cairo , the numbers of rodents rose to fearsome levels . 
The publicity and resulting panic surrounding the WHO &apos;s announcement of Phase 5 and 6 alerts - especially in the absence ( until December ) of widely available vaccine - also brought out fraudsters peddling all sorts of ineffective and possibly dangerous protective gear and nostrums : gloves , masks , dietary supplements , shampoo , a nasal sanitizer , and a spray that supposedly coats the hands with a layer of anti-microbial &quot; ionic silver . &quot; 
For all these reasons , the declaration of a pandemic must not be a prediction but rather a kind of real-time snapshot . 
The WHO &apos;s performance has been widely criticized : the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe , for example , said on January 12 that it plans to debate &quot; false pandemics , a threat to health &quot; later this month . 
And yet WHO officials continue to defend their actions . 
In a January 14 conference call with reporters , Keiji Fukuda , the special adviser to the WHO &apos;s director general for pandemic flu , argued that the organization did not overplay the dangers but &quot; prepared for the worst and hoped for the best . &quot; 
The WHO &apos;s dubious decisions demonstrate that its officials are either too rigid or incompetent ( or both ) to make necessary adjustments to the pandemic warning system - which is what we have come to expect from an organization that is scientifically challenged , self-important , and unaccountable . 
It may be able to perform and report worldwide surveillance - i.e. , count numbers of cases and fatalities - but its policy role should be drastically reduced .
