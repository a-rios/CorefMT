Putin &apos;s Ironic Potential 
MOSCOW - Vladimir Putin &apos;s recapture of the Russian presidency has been met with widespread derision , both at home and abroad . 
But the autocrat &apos;s return to the Kremlin could be Russia &apos;s best hope to escape stagnation . 
With his open contempt for Russian society - exemplified in his mocking response to widespread demonstrations - as well as his arrogance , readiness to stifle dissent , and fear of competition , Putin has singlehandedly quashed the long-held myth that he himself propagated : personalized power can modernize the country while preserving stability . 
To be sure , Putin &apos;s Kremlin - and his corrupt cohorts - still calls the shots . 
And , while his decision to return to the presidency has vexed the most dynamic elements of Russia &apos;s urban population , the rest of the country &apos;s citizens remain unhappy but quiescent . 
Likewise , Russia &apos;s demoralized intellectuals and political class , on whom the population relies to advocate change , neglect to act . 
The global rise in oil prices , endemic fear of change , lack of a viable alternative , and reliance on state hand-outs are keeping Russia in a state of inertia . 
Moreover , Putin &apos;s Kremlin has used the West - eager for engagement and a policy &quot; reset &quot; with Russia - to legitimize its authoritarian rule and to provide opportunities for its venal cronies &quot; integration into Western society . 
Indeed , by using the West to launder their dirty money , Putin and his cohorts have , in a way , avenged the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse by undermining the West &apos;s principles and discrediting liberal democracy in the eyes of the Russian population . 
But cracks are forming in Russian society , threatening the status quo . 
And it is not the opposition or a popular rebellion that are beginning to destabilize Putin &apos;s regime , but the very forces that have helped to keep it afloat . 
After waiting 12 years for change from the top , Russians finally understand that their political system can be transformed only from the bottom - through popular revolution . 
In the absence of institutional channels for expression of their grievances over the corrupt concessions that have preserved the ruling elite &apos;s power , they must take to the streets . 
But the question remains : Will Russia this time escape its traditional final act , in which the new regime turns out to be more predatory than the previous one ? 
Or will Russians find a way to pursue peaceful revolution ? 
Today , the Kremlin is contributing to its own violent demise , intentionally demoralizing Russian society . 
It discredits liberalism by employing liberal rhetoric and appointing liberal leaders to administer its authoritarian rule , leaving political opposition to leftist parties and nationalists . 
And Putin &apos;s return to the Stalinist practice of sending police to search opponents &quot; homes , combined with his attempts to ignite hostility between social groups - for example , between provincial Russia and the urban middle class - is deepening antagonism and distrust among citizens . 
In this way , Putin &apos;s regime intensifies political dissenters &quot; longing for retaliation - thereby hindering peaceful change . 
Already , longstanding tensions have begun to boil over ; tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets since Putin &apos;s 2011 announcement that he would reclaim the presidency . 
His return to the Kremlin has incited some of the largest protests that Moscow has seen since the 1990 &quot; s . 
And , while popular demonstrations have diminished - largely as a result of draconian new anti-protest laws - the more conflict accumulates beneath the surface , the more devastating the eventual explosion will be . 
By censoring the media , discrediting moderate opposition , and provoking popular discontent , Putin is playing with fire . 
It is impossible to predict when Russia will detonate , but the system &apos;s fissures are undeniable - and growing . 
The Kremlin , far from being able to control the situation , does not fully grasp what is happening . 
Russia is moving toward precipice . 
Massive capital flight and efforts by Kremlin cronies to engineer a safe landing for themselves in the West show that , even in the eyes of Putin &apos;s cohorts , the end of his Ã©poque is approaching . 
Yet Putin &apos;s Kremlin continues to work tirelessly to prevent the formation of a strong opposition - increasing the risk that the regime will collapse without a viable alternative . 
The longer Putin remains in power , the more devastating his regime &apos;s final act will be . 
Both Russia and the West must begin to plan ahead . 
Regrettably , Russia &apos;s awakening corresponds with the beginning of the West &apos;s seeming decline . 
Still , rather than remaining complicit in Putin &apos;s corrupt regime , the West must help the Russian people to seek their new destiny . 
And Russia &apos;s citizens must not give up hope . 
Putin &apos;s return to the Kremlin , although painful , could end up curtailing their agony by triggering the regime &apos;s destruction . 
When the choice is between an outdated system &apos;s implosion and its slow degradation , a swift , clean break typically offers better prospects for a new start .
