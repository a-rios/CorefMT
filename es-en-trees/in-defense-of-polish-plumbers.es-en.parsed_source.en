In Defense of Polish Plumbers 
Supporters of Europe &apos;s social model claim that what distinguishes it is the importance placed on &quot; social cohesion . &quot; 
Existing policies to achieve social cohesion are based on the belief that , if uncorrected , the free play of market forces will lead to wide disparities in income and thus intensify social conflict . 
In fact , some transfers flow the other way . 
For example , many pension systems transfer money from the poor to the middle class , simply because richer people usually live longer . 
What most European countries get for their social expenditure is a lot of state provision of services , and not much reduction in social inequality . 
Moreover , if Europeans target social expenditure better , they might achieve a greater reduction in inequality with a lower level of social transfers . 
Indeed , some policies aimed at achieving cohesion may well reduce it . 
Restriction on firing employees , for example , may protect people who have jobs , but often at the expense of the unemployed , thus increasing social exclusion . 
Even where high levels of social transfers actually do reduce inequality ( and therefore presumably increase cohesion ) , they may undermine inter-communal relations if ethnic minorities are perceived as being strong net beneficiaries . 
The European Union resulted from the tragic lessons of the first half of the twentieth century , when giving free rein to national egoism led to continental catastrophe , and increasing globalization means that economic , internal , foreign , and defense policies are unlikely to be successful when pursued exclusively at national level . 
Yet we continue to believe that social cohesion can be limited to that of the nation . 
European cohesion funds account for only a fraction of a percent of European GDP , whereas about 10 % of national income is typically spent on social transfers . 
A massive increase in European Commission spending power to achieve greater pan-European social cohesion would be politically unacceptable to the richer members , who would have to pay for it . 
Fortunately , inequalities can often be reduced considerably without spending much money . 
Nothing that the EU or its individual members can do would have as great an impact on reducing income inequality in Europe than eliminating national protectionist barriers to migration , movement of capital , and provision of services . 
Doing so would reduce inequalities not only between EU member states , but also within the poorer ones . 
The poorest of the poor would gain the most , while the rich member states would lose little , despite their popular fear of open borders . 
For example , during the referendum campaign in France for the European constitution , the &quot; Polish plumber &quot; became a symbol of the threat that European integration was supposed to pose to French workers &quot; standards of living . 
But the impact of free migration ( when allowed ) on French plumbers &quot; incomes is in fact minimal , not least because of the smallness of the new member states compared to the whole of Western Europe . 
Workers &quot; incomes in Britain and Ireland have not fallen measurably , despite both countries &quot; openness to immigration from the enlarged EU . 
Free migration in the EU means that Polish plumbers will not only catch up with French plumbers , but also with Polish bankers . 
Why , then , was the European Commission &apos;s proposed services directive , which would ensure freedom to supply services across the Union to all EU companies , vilified as the &quot; Frankenstein directive &quot; ? 
Why was it fatally diluted by the European Parliament ? 
Why have demands by the EU &apos;s new member states for freer access to Western Europe &apos;s labor and services markets , and for the right to compete with &quot; old Europe &quot; for investment , been stigmatized as social dumping ? 
Why are policies that would do the most to reduce inequality in Europe being presented as anti-social ? 
What motivates the opponents of free service provision and labor movement in Europe is not a desire to ensure social cohesion , but a wish to maintain the status quo . 
To be sure , change creates discomfort , and may even cause tension and conflict . 
Indeed , such attitudes are potentially disastrous . 
If they came to be accepted as the guiding principles of European policy , Europe &apos;s economy would become petrified , with stagnant growth making it impossible to afford even modest levels of social transfers .
