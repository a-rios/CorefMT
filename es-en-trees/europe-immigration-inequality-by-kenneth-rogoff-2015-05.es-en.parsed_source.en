Inequality , Immigration , and Hypocrisy 
CAMBRIDGE - Europe &apos;s migration crisis exposes a fundamental flaw , if not towering hypocrisy , in the ongoing debate about economic inequality . 
Wouldn &apos;t a true progressive support equal opportunity for all people on the planet , rather than just for those of us lucky enough to have been born and raised in rich countries ? 
Many thought leaders in advanced economies advocate an entitlement mentality . 
But the entitlement stops at the border : though they regard greater redistribution within individual countries as an absolute imperative , people who live in emerging markets or developing countries are left out . 
If current concerns about inequality were cast entirely in political terms , this inward-looking focus would be understandable ; after all , citizens of poor countries cannot vote in rich ones . 
But the rhetoric of the inequality debate in rich countries betrays a moral certitude that conveniently ignores the billions of people elsewhere who are far worse off . 
One must not forget that even after a period of stagnation , the middle class in rich countries remains an upper class from a global perspective . 
Only about 15 % of the world &apos;s population lives in developed economies . 
Yet advanced countries still account for more than 40 % of global consumption and resource depletion . 
Yes , higher taxes on the wealthy make sense as a way to alleviate inequality within a country . 
But that will not solve the problem of deep poverty in the developing world . 
Nor will it do to appeal to moral superiority to justify why someone born in the West enjoys so many advantages . 
Yes , sound political and social institutions are the bedrock of sustained economic growth ; indeed , they are the sine qua non of all cases of successful development . 
But Europe &apos;s long history of exploitative colonialism makes it hard to guess how Asian and African institutions would have evolved in a parallel universe where Europeans came only to trade , not to conquer . 
Many broad policy issues are distorted when viewed through a lens that focuses only on domestic inequality and ignores global inequality . 
Thomas Piketty &apos;s Marxian claim that capitalism is failing because domestic inequality is rising has it exactly backwards . 
When one weights all of the world &apos;s citizens equally , things look very different . 
In particular , the same forces of globalization that have contributed to stagnant middle-class wages in rich countries have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty elsewhere . 
By many measures , global inequality has been reduced significantly over the past three decades , implying that capitalism has succeeded spectacularly . 
Capitalism has perhaps eroded rents that workers in advanced countries enjoy by virtue of where they were born . 
But it has done even more to help the world &apos;s true middle-income workers in Asia and emerging markets . 
Allowing freer flows of people across borders would equalize opportunities even faster than trade , but resistance is fierce . 
Anti-immigration political parties have made large inroads in countries like France and the United Kingdom , and are a major force in many other countries as well . 
Of course , millions of desperate people who live in war zones and failed states have little choice but to seek asylum in rich countries , whatever the risk . 
Wars in Syria , Eritrea , Libya , and Mali have been a huge factor in driving the current surge of refugees seeking to reach Europe . 
Even if these countries were to stabilize , instability in other regions would most likely take their place . 
Economic pressures are another potent force for migration . 
Workers from poor countries welcome the opportunity to work in advanced countries , even at what seem like rock-bottom wages . 
Unfortunately , most of the debate in rich countries today , on both the left and the right , centers on how to keep other people out . 
That may be practical , but it certainly is not morally defensible . 
And migration pressure will increase markedly if global warming unfolds according to climatologists &quot; baseline predictions . 
As equatorial regions become too hot and arid to sustain agriculture , rising temperatures in the north will make agriculture more productive . 
Shifting weather patterns could then fuel migration to richer countries at levels that make today &apos;s immigration crisis seem trivial , particularly given that poor countries and emerging markets typically are closer to the equator and in more vulnerable climates . 
With most rich countries &quot; capacity and tolerance for immigration already limited , it is hard to see how a new equilibrium for global population distribution will be reached peacefully . 
Resentment against the advanced economies , which account for a vastly disproportionate share of global pollution and commodity consumption , could boil over . 
As the world becomes richer , inequality inevitably will loom as a much larger issue relative to poverty , a point I first argued more than a decade ago . 
Regrettably , however , the inequality debate has focused so intensely on domestic inequality that the far larger issue of global inequality has been overshadowed . 
That is a pity , because there are many ways rich countries can make a difference . 
They can provide free online medical and education support , more development aid , debt write-downs , market access , and greater contributions to global security . 
The arrival of desperate boat people on Europe &apos;s shores is a symptom of their failure to do so .
