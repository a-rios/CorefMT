Does Austerity Promote Economic Growth ? 
NEW HAVEN - In his classic Fable of the Bees : or , Private Vices , Publick Benefits ( 1724 ) , Bernard Mandeville , the Dutch-born British philosopher and satirist , described - in verse - a prosperous society ( of bees ) that suddenly chose to make a virtue of austerity , dropping all excess expenditure and extravagant consumption . 
What then happened ? 
The Price of Land and Houses falls ; 
Mirac &apos;lous Palaces , whose Walls , 
Like those of Thebes , were rais &apos;d by Play 
Are to be let ; . . . . 
The building Trade is quite destroy &apos;d 
Artificers are not employ &apos;d ; . . . 
Those , that remain &apos;d , grown temp &apos;rate strive 
Not how to spend , but how to live . . . 
That sounds a lot like what many advanced countries have been going through , after financial-crisis-induced austerity plans were launched , doesn &apos;t it ? 
Is Mandeville a genuine prophet for our times ? 
Fable of the Bees developed a wide following , and generated substantial controversy , which continues to this day . 
The austerity plans being adopted by governments in much of Europe and elsewhere around the world , and the curtailment of consumption expenditure by individuals as well , threaten to produce a global recession . 
But how do we know if Mandeville is right about austerity ? 
His research method - a long poem about his theory - is hardly convincing to modern ears . 
Harvard economist Alberto Alesina recently summarized evidence concerning whether government deficit reduction - that is , expenditure cuts and / or tax increases - always induces such negative effects : &quot; The answer to this question is a loud no . &quot; 
Sometimes , even often , economies prosper nicely after the government &apos;s deficit is sharply reduced . 
Sometimes , just maybe , the austerity program boosts confidence in such a way as to ignite a recovery . 
We have to examine the issue with some care , understanding that the issue that Mandeville raised is really a statistical one : the outcome of government deficit reduction is never entirely predictable , so we can ask only how likely such a plan is to succeed in restoring economic prosperity . 
For example , if evidence of future economic strength makes a government worry about economic overheating and inflation , it might try to cool domestic demand by raising taxes and lowering government spending . 
If the government is only partly successful in preventing economic overheating , it might nonetheless appear to casual observers that austerity actually strengthened the economy . 
Likewise , the government &apos;s deficit might fall not because of austerity , but because the stock market &apos;s anticipation of economic growth fuels higher revenues from capital-gains tax . 
Once again , we would see what might appear , from looking at the government deficit , to be an austerity-to-prosperity scenario . 
Jaime Guajardo , Daniel Leigh , and Andrea Pescatori of the International Monetary Fund recently studied austerity plans implemented by governments in 17 countries in the last 30 years . 
But their approach differed from that of previous researchers . 
They focused on the government &apos;s intent , and looked at what officials actually said , not just at the pattern of public debt . 
They identified as austerity plans only those cases in which governments imposed tax hikes or spending cuts because they viewed it as a prudent policy with potential long-term benefits , not because they were responding to the short-term economic outlook and sought to reduce the risk of overheating . 
Their analysis found a clear tendency for austerity programs to reduce consumption expenditure and weaken the economy . 
That conclusion , if valid , stands as a stern warning to policymakers today . 
But critics , such as Valerie Ramey of the University of California at San Diego , think that Guajardo , Leigh , and Pescatori have not completely proven their case . 
It is possible , Ramey argues , that their results could reflect a different sort of reverse causality if governments are more likely to respond to high public-debt levels with austerity programs when they have reason to believe that economic conditions could make the debt burden especially worrisome . 
That may seem unlikely - one would think that a bad economic outlook would incline governments to postpone , rather than accelerate , austerity measures . 
But Ramey could be right . 
One would then find that government spending cuts or tax hikes tend to be followed by bad economic times , even if the causality runs the other way . 
Ultimately , the problem of judging austerity programs is that economists cannot run fully controlled experiments . 
When researchers tested Prozac on depressed patients , they divided their subjects randomly into control and experimental groups , and conducted many trials . 
We cannot do that with national debt . 
So do we have to conclude that historical analysis teaches us no useful lessons ? 
Do we have to return to the abstract reasoning of Mandeville and some of his successors , including John Maynard Keynes , who thought that there were reasons to expect that austerity would produce depressions ? 
There is no abstract theory that can predict how people will react to an austerity program . 
We have no alternative but to look at the historical evidence . 
Policymakers cannot afford to wait decades for economists to figure out a definitive answer , which may never be found at all .
