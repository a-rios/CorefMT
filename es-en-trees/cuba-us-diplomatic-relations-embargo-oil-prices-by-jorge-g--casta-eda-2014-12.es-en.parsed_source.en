Why Cuba Turned 
MEXICO CITY - The phone call between United States President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro , followed by the exchange of an American prisoner for three Cuban intelligence agents detained in the US , marked the most important moment in the countries &quot; bilateral relationship in decades . 
Shortly afterward , the US and Cuba announced that they would begin the process of resuming full diplomatic ties . 
At first sight , the agreement looks like a great victory for Cuba , with the US finally backing down from its attempt to isolate the communist island . 
The reality is somewhat more complicated . 
For starters , this is not the end of the American trade embargo , which can be lifted only by the US Congress . 
Nor will relations be fully normalized ; there will be embassies , but not ambassadors . 
But there is no question that the agreement - brokered by the Vatican and Canada - is an important step forward . 
The US State Department will remove Cuba from the list of countries that it accuses of supporting terrorism . 
It is true that Cuba seems to have given up very little in exchange . 
In addition to releasing the American , Alan Gross , Castro agreed to free 53 political prisoners , loosen restrictions on the Internet , and grant access to United Nations human-rights officials and observers from the International Red Cross . 
These are concessions , to be sure , but not large ones in view of what Cuba stands to gain with the resumption of diplomatic relations after a half-century of isolation . 
Nonetheless , Cuba is in trouble , owing to a crucial variable that probably motivated Castro &apos;s decision : the recent collapse in the price of oil . 
A series of factors - the spectacular increase in oil and gas production in the US , the recession in Europe and Japan , the decision by Saudi Arabia to keep its taps flowing , and the economic slowdown in China and India - have led to a supply glut . 
And the two countries most affected are precisely those on which Cuba has historically depended to keep its economy afloat : Russia and Venezuela . 
Of the two , Venezuela and its troubles pose the biggest threat to Cuba &apos;s stability . 
Russia has not supported Cuba significantly since the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
But Venezuela - especially under former President Hugo Chávez - has been an important patron , sending Cuba about 100,000 barrels of oil a day , along with some $ 5-15 billion in aid every year . 
Those subsidies are unlikely to continue . 
Indeed , it is likely no coincidence that the talks between the US and Cuba started shortly after Chávez died in 2013 . 
There is little doubt that , in the absence of Venezuelan subsidies , Cuba will once again plunge into depression - as it did after Russian assistance dried up in early 1990s . 
This leaves Cuba extremely vulnerable . 
Incomes have fallen . 
Widespread shortages have fueled rampant inflation , with hyperinflation a growing risk . 
The currency trades on the black market are at little more than 3 % of the official rate . 
A major political upheaval is becoming increasingly likely . 
In their book , Back Channel to Cuba : The Hidden History of Negotiations Between Washington and Havana , William LeoGrande and Peter Kornbluh describe how Cuba has consistently refused to offer political concessions in exchange for the end of the embargo or diplomatic normalization . 
And , indeed , Castro did not offer any in the recently announced deal . 
And yet the economic calculus makes it very likely that change will soon be forthcoming . 
In the absence of a rich and generous patron , the revival of the Cuban economy will depend on the full normalization of relations with the US - and this is certain to prove impossible without major changes with respect to democracy and human rights . 
When the history of the present is written , it may very well turn out that it was not force of arms nor the efforts of diplomats , but disinterested interventions by remote oil barons in North Dakota and the Arabian Peninsula that finally unlocked Castro &apos;s Cuba .
