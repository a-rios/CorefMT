Plugging the Leaks 
MUNICH - With pain and misgiving , the United States Congress bailed out Wall Street in order to prevent a meltdown of America &apos;s financial system . 
The US financial institutions that went bankrupt in 2008 - or that would have gone bankrupt without government help - were in trouble because they lacked equity capital . 
They did not lack that capital because they never had it , but because they paid out too much of their abundant earnings in previous years to shareholders , leveraging their operations excessively with debt capital . 
If no measures are taken to increase the minimum equity requirements for banks and other financial institutions , financial crises like the current one could recur . Anglo-Saxon financial institutions are known for their high dividend-payout ratios . 
From a European perspective , the hunger for dividends and the emphasis on short-term performance goals that characterize these institutions is both amazing and frightening . 
Investment banks , in particular , are known for their minimalist equity approach . 
While normal banks need an equity-asset ratio of at least 7 % , investment banks typically operated on a ratio of only 4 % . 
The lack of equity resulted largely from the concept of &quot; limited liability , &quot; which provided an incentive for excessive leveraging . 
Earnings left inside a financial institution can easily be lost in turbulent times . 
Only earnings taken out in time can be secured . 
Lack of equity capital , in turn , made risk-averse shareholders hire gamblers to manage their limited-liability investment companies . 
The managers chose overly risky operations , because they knew that the shareholders would not participate symmetrically in the risks . 
While upside risks would be turned into dividends , downside risks would be limited to the stock of equity invested . 
Claims against the personal wealth of shareholders would be blocked by the limited liability constraint . 
The banks &quot; creditors or governments ultimately would bear any losses . 
The mutual interaction between the incentive to minimize equity capital and the incentive to gamble in order to exploit the upside risks caused America &apos;s crisis . 
In theory , bank lenders and the government could anticipate the additional risks they encounter when a company chooses a high-leverage strategy . 
Lenders may charge higher interest rates , and the government may charge higher taxes or fees . 
But this theory fails to match reality . 
Governments do not tax the return on equity less than debt interest , and lenders do not sufficiently honor the benefits of high equity with lower interest rates , owing to a lack of information about the true repayment probability . 
This is why equity capital held by financial institutions typically is more than twice as expensive as debt capital and why these institutions try to minimize its use . 
The provision of limited liability not only turned Wall Street into a casino , but so-called &quot; Main Street &quot; also was induced to gamble , because homeowners enjoyed a limited liability similar to that of the companies . 
When low-income borrowers took out a loan to buy their homes - often 100 % of the purchase price - they typically could use the home as collateral without warranting the repayment with additional wealth or even their income . 
Thus , they were protected against the downside risk of falling house prices and profited by speculating on the upside risk of appreciation . 
Such homeowners knew that with rising prices they would be able to realize a gain by either selling their homes or increasing their debt , while in the case of falling prices they could simply hand over the keys to their banks . 
Given the uncertainty about future house prices , they could reasonably expect gains , which induced them to pay even more in the first place . 
Gambling by Main Street caused the sub-prime crisis . 
The crisis spread because the banking system was not sufficiently risk-averse - and in some cases even seemed to relish risk . 
Mortgage banks kept some claims on their books , but sold most of them to investment banks as &quot; mortgage-backed securities . &quot; 
The investment banks blended these securities into &quot; asset-backed securities &quot; and &quot; collateralized debt obligations &quot; ( CDOs ) and sold them on to financial institutions throughout the world . 
These institutions , attracted by the high rates of return that were promised , invariably neglected the downside risks . 
The buyers of the CDOs were often misguided by rating agencies that performed badly and did not provide reliable information . 
As private rating agencies live on the fees they collect from rated companies , they cannot easily downgrade important clients or the assets they sell . 
The big American investment banks received excellent ratings up to the last moment , and so did the CDOs with which they betrayed the world . 
All of this explains why the US had such a formidable period of growth in recent years , despite the fact that household savings were close to zero , and why foreigners were willing to finance a record US current-account deficit of more than 5 % of GDP - higher than it has been since 1929 . 
That period is now over . 
The US must carry out fundamental reforms of its financial system to plug the equity leaks and recover investors &quot; confidence . 
American households will need to learn to accumulate wealth by cutting consumption rather than speculating on real estate . 
A painful decade of stagnation for America lies ahead .
