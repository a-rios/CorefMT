Edmund Phelps &apos;s Journey 
The winner of this year &apos;s Nobel prize for economics , Edmund Phelps , is a giant in the field . 
His contributions have been , and remain , so important as that they have altered traditional ways of thinking . 
According to the social science citations index , he ranks well among the most important economists since Adam Smith . 
Economists working on the macro economy , its micro foundations , exogenous and endogenous growth theory , the formation of expectations and problems of information and discrimination all refer back to Phelps . 
After a brilliant secondary education , Phelps entered Amherst College in Massachusetts without any specific idea about which discipline to embrace or which career to follow . 
He was passionate about philosophy but , at the insistence of his father , took classes in economics . 
As nearly always happens , Phelps &apos;s choice of vocation came after meeting an important professor , in this case the Harvard economist James Nelson . 
After some hesitation , Phelps decided to pursue graduate education . 
Paul Samuelson admits that he agreed to do a conference at Amherst with the sole aim of recruiting Phelps to MIT . 
But Phelps chose Yale , where he came into direct contact with James Tobin and Thomas Schelling . 
He wrote his thesis under Tobin &apos;s supervision . 
With Ph.D. in hand , Phelps spent a year at the Rand Corporation in Los Angeles before returning to Yale . 
He spent another year at MIT , where he taught with Robert Solow and met Samuelson and Franco Modigliani . 
Stints at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University followed . 
By this point , Phelps had already acquired an international reputation through his work on the golden rule of capital accumulation ( he was 28 ) . 
This concept now appears in the toolbox of every economist , is taught in all classes on growth , and serves as a reference in all works on the macro economy . 
Later , Phelps developed a long-term growth theory based on education and technical advances . 
However , this contribution was so far ahead of its time that the profession did not discover its importance until a quarter-century later , when theorists were developing endogenous growth theories . 
Phelps was also 10 to 20 years ahead of the profession when he developed the theories of wage efficiency and inflation targeting , which are now considered to be the state of the art concerning the labour market and monetary management . 
In the late 1960 &quot; s and early 1970 &quot; s , Phelps &apos;s encounters with Amartya Sen , John Rawls , and Kenneth Arrow at Stanford revived his philosophical streak . 
He had extremely valuable intellectual conversations with Rawls , prompting him to write several essays on the theory of economic justice and publish a book on the subject in 1974 - a book still used today . 
Phelps was behind the modern reworking of the macro economy - and , according to Samuelson , the micro economy , too . 
His research programme consisted of introducing the imperfection of information and knowledge into economic theory , which he then reformulated , giving serious consideration to agents &quot; expectations . 
In Microeconomic Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory , a famous work that he published and to which he made three major contributions , he set the scene for what would become the greatest revolution in economic theory of the last 50 years . 
It is to Phelps that we owe the theory of the natural unemployment rate - a cornerstone of modern macroeconomic theory and economic policy that Milton Friedman rediscovered a year later , albeit heuristically . 
Phelps was also responsible for the &quot; island parable , &quot; which helped explain why monetary policy can have temporary real effects as a result of imperfect information . 
The bulk of Phelps &apos;s current work consists of a new reworking of structuralist theory , in an effort to show how changes in interest rates and asset prices affect the equilibrium unemployment rate over the medium term . 
Phelps &apos;s new theory provides a logical backdrop against which we can assess the consequences of fluctuations in share prices , exchange rates , and , more generally , the value of physical assets and human capital under the powerful influence of new technologies and innovation . 
These are , of course , the main phenomena that economic theory struggles to explain nowadays . 
So it is easy to understand why Phelps still leads the way . 
Indeed , we can expect his new theoretical framework to become a reference point in a decade or two . 
When recommending an Indian mathematician to a Harvard colleague , Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote that : &quot; scientific geniuses generally have one great idea in their life ; he has had two . &quot;
