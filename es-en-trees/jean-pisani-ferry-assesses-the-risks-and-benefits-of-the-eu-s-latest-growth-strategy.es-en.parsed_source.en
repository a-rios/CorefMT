Can Investment Save Europe ? 
PARIS - Economic growth in Europe remains disappointing . 
Virtually all European Union members are expected to post higher output in 2014 ; but , according to the International Monetary Fund &apos;s latest projections , the average growth rate in the eurozone will barely exceed 1 % . 
And , whereas the British economy is displaying strong momentum , its GDP has only now surpassed the pre-crisis mark . 
In per capita terms , the EU is still poorer than it was seven years ago . 
In this context , a new policy target has emerged : investment . 
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi , who currently holds the EU &apos;s rotating presidency , has pushed for it , and Jean-Claude Juncker , the president-elect of the European Commission , has called it his &quot; first priority . &quot; 
His goal for the next three years is to mobilize an additional € 100 billion ( $ 134 billion ) per year ( 0.75 % of GDP ) for public and private investment . 
Investment is certainly a politically appealing theme . 
It can unite Keynesians and supply-side advocates ; proponents of public spending and supporters of private business can stand together . 
And historically low long-term interest rates undoubtedly provide an exceptionally favorable opportunity to finance new ventures . 
But it does not automatically follow that governments should pour money into public infrastructure projects or foster private investment by adding further incentives amid already auspicious market conditions . 
At a time when private income has shrunk , public resources are scarce , and debt burdens are heavy , plans to stimulate investment should be carefully scrutinized . 
Even seemingly purposeful projects can seriously backfire : only a few years ago , Europe &apos;s well-intentioned efforts to stimulate renewables resulted in a solar energy bubble of macroeconomic proportions . 
Whereas cutting greenhouse-gas emissions is necessary , the current generation of relatively inefficient renewables should not be deployed at the expense of the development of more cost-effective technology . 
That is why it is essential to determine , prior to any effort to boost investment , whether sluggish growth in Europe reflects abnormally low capital formation . 
The data suggest that it does : from 2007 to 2013 , investment has fallen by 18 % in the EU , compared to just 6 % in the United States . 
In Southern Europe , investment has literally collapsed ; even in Germany , it will reach pre-crisis levels only this year . 
But this is hardly a sufficient observation , because excessive pre-crisis real-estate investment made a sharp downward adjustment inevitable . 
More generally , investment tends to follow economic growth : companies add new capacity only if there is demand for their products . 
A recession almost always implies a disproportionate fall in investment . 
For these reasons , determining whether low investment is a cause or a consequence of slow growth is not as easy as it may seem . 
Taking push and pull factors into account , DIW , the German economic institute , reckons that the investment gap is real ; for the eurozone , it puts the gap at about 2 % of GDP , or € 200 billion . 
That is a significant number , which suggests that there is a case for policy action . 
That raises the next issue : what impedes investment , and what can be done to remove such obstacles ? 
Part of the answer concerns regulation . 
For example , investment in efficient energy production and conservation is being held back by pervasive uncertainty about the future path of climate policies . 
A European agreement on how to stabilize the price of carbon would help to catalyze private projects . 
At the national level , well designed , stable schemes to improve domestic heating efficiency would also be helpful . 
More generally , regulatory clarity and predictability are essential to private investment . 
The answer is also partly financial . 
In Europe , the pre-crisis boom in real-estate investment was fueled by reckless credit flows from Northern to Southern Europe . 
Credit rationing has followed , as banks reduced their overburdened balance sheets and were discouraged from risk-taking . 
Moreover , money has flowed back to Northern Europe from the distressed periphery . 
As a result , credit for , say , a small Spanish company is neither cheap nor abundant . 
This calls for immediate action . 
Packaging existing loan portfolios and offloading them to non-bank investors , as many have proposed , should be encouraged . 
Beyond short-term fixes , the main priority must be to encourage a resumption of savings flows across Europe , but this time in the form of equity , not bank deposits and loans . 
For this , Europe needs an adequate regulatory and tax framework . 
Official institutions could also be involved in a suitable way . 
Oddly , the European Investment Bank , the EU &apos;s financial arm , is authorized to provide only loans and guarantees , not equity investment . 
There are , finally , a few fields where national governments could act directly . 
Infrastructure is a case in point , provided that the current interest in investment projects is not used as an excuse to revive Europe &apos;s love for white elephants . 
Will it be enough ? 
It is hard to know . 
The EU faces a delicate balancing act between the need to foster investment and the need to remain cautious , especially with public money . 
Juncker , for his part , will need to display both firm resolve and sound judgment .
