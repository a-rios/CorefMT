Europe Through American Eyes 
Europeans are constantly reminded of all that is wrong with America . 
But perhaps Europeans should reverse the process : what do Americans think is wrong with Europe ? 
Above all , Americans see Europe as a continent of self-inflicted stagnation - and with good reason . 
Economic growth in the EU was near zero in 2003 . 
Several countries , most notably Germany and France , seem hobbled by inflexible labor markets and regulations that inhibit dynamism . 
The European Union &apos;s highly touted &quot; Lisbon Declaration &quot; of a few years ago , which proclaimed that Europe would become the world &apos;s most competitive region by 2010 , appears laughable to Americans , whose productivity gains seem to scale new heights constantly . 
America also sees Europe as excessively inward looking , sometimes dangerously so . 
Worse , informed Americans see anti-Semitism running rampant in Europe and xenophobic political parties on the march in country after country . 
Not even pacific Scandinavia is exempt from this . 
Americans see a total inability by Europe to handle immigration in ways that encourage dynamism and diversity instead of antagonism and higher state spending . 
This seems all the more puzzling because Americans realize how badly Europe needs new immigrants , given its extremely low fertility rates . 
Europe &apos;s perceived attitude towards rogue states and global terrorism only enhances this perception of self-satisfied inwardness . 
Americans may differ about what policy should have been pursued in Iraq , but they know that their country cannot run from its role as a world leader responsible for developments in North Korea , the Middle East , Pakistan / India , Taiwan , and elsewhere . 
It is a jungle out there , as Americans say ; not every problem and conflict can be handled through the sort of peaceful , drawn-out negotiations that the EU prefers . 
Germany and France were against meeting Saddam Hussein with military force , but had no alternative for getting rid of the butcher of Baghdad . 
&quot; What was the European answer to the problem of Saddam Hussein ? &quot; asked Senator Joe Biden in a panel discussion at the recent Davos forum . 
Biden is a Democrat and strong critic of President Bush . 
&quot; I asked French and German leaders , but never received any credible answer . &quot; 
&quot; We are not even ready to forcefully meet conflicts on our own continent , &quot; Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski sighed . 
Bosnia &apos;s Muslims thank America , not the EU , for their deliverance from slaughter . 
Europe devotes half as much in financial resources to the military as the US , resulting in one-tenth of America &apos;s military strength , observed Pat Cox , Speaker of the European Parliament . 
Americans now see Europe as compounding its military weakness by losing its leading position in science . 
Two thirds of Nobel Laureates in the sciences during the last quarter century were Americans ; many of the others do or did research at American universities . 
According to Time magazine , 400,000 European researchers now work in the US . 
Lack of funding , bureaucracies so complicated that even purchasing a used computer is problematic , hierarchies that hamper the joy of curiosity and creativity : all of these barriers confront European scientists and are responsible for inciting today &apos;s &quot; brain drain &quot; to America . 
Add economics to this recipe as well . 
Price regulations and other ill-considered features of European policy contribute to the fact that 60 % of the world &apos;s new drugs are developed in the US , compared to 40 % only ten years ago . 
This sterility and inertia make Europe less and less interesting for Americans . 
So American eyes are turning elsewhere : to China with its 1.3 billion people and an economy growing at 8-10 % , year in and year out , and to India , with its 1.1 billion people and 6 % annual growth . 
Indeed , India now has some of the world &apos;s best engineers , IT technicians and medical professionals . 
With new patent laws coming into place , India will have the same attraction for the pharmaceutical industry as it has for IT , providing clinical trials for new drugs at a quarter of the cost of Europe or the US . 
While America increases its population somewhat , due to normal reproductive rates and large immigration flows , Europe &apos;s share of the world &apos;s population is approaching a mere 4 % and seems doomed to growing older as it shrinks even more . 
Demographic change in the US is also working to change America &apos;s global orientation . 
With American immigration dominated by Latin Americans and Asians , the US feels its European heritage less . 
Similarly , domestic US politics is gravitating to the country &apos;s south and west , regions that look towards Latin America and Asia , not Europe . 
The fall of the Soviet empire , naturally , reduced Americans &apos; security interest in Europe . 
Is this American-eye view of Europe unfair ? 
Perhaps . 
It is , however , no more unfair than how America is regularly portrayed in Europe &apos;s media these days . 
But if Americans are critical of Europe , they are also self-critical , far more so than most Europeans . 
As a European editor wrote apropos the flow of scientists from Europe to America : &quot; What &apos;s most sad is that Europeans still believe that their society represents the epitome of civilization , while the US is on its way to downfall . 
What if the reality is the reverse ? &quot; 
Every European should contemplate that possibility , at least for a moment , before resuming their current aversion to all things American .
