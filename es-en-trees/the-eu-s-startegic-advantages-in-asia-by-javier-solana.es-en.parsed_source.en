Europe &apos;s Smart Asian Pivot 
MADRID - For the first time in centuries , the focus of the global economy is shifting to the East . 
The United States has commenced its &quot; pivot &quot; to Asia , and its relations with China , in particular , seem constantly to be flirting with Thucydides &apos;s trap , the historical pattern that suggests that a rising power will inevitably collide with a reigning power . 
But , with the US and China regarding each another warily in the foreground of world affairs , where does Europe fit in ? 
The European Union is at a critical historical juncture , one that demands its own pivot eastward - a coherent and decisive Asian strategy that builds on Europe &apos;s strengths . 
Although the EU &apos;s population is only one-fifth the size of that of China and India combined , and its military presence in Asia is minimal , its € 12.6 trillion ( $ 16.8 trillion ) economy is the world &apos;s largest . 
This has not gone unnoticed by Asia &apos;s governments , which are heavily dependent on economic growth to meet their young and growing populations &quot; demand for jobs and prosperity . 
Currently , Asia is the EU &apos;s main trading partner , surpassing North America and constituting one-third of its total trade . 
Trade with China alone is worth more than € 1 billion per day , second only to trade with the US . 
Moreover , the EU has a somewhat paradoxical asset at its disposal : it is not a Pacific power and does not carry the burden of great-power status in Asia . 
Far from being a weakness , this is precisely the source of the EU &apos;s potential strength in Asia , for it provides a degree of diplomatic agility that the American heavyweight cannot muster . 
In attempting to execute its strategic pivot , the US is haunted at virtually every turn by its status as a historical hegemon , a military power , and the guarantor of its Asian allies &quot; security . 
Even when rebranded as a &quot; rebalancing , &quot; America &apos;s eastward shift is inevitably met with suspicion by some Asian countries , particularly China . 
Europe , by contrast , can use its agility to perform a &quot; smart pivot . &quot; 
The EU must engage with Asia on at least three mutually beneficial fronts , with trade being the most important . 
The trade-liberalization agreements that the EU has in the pipeline with Asia &apos;s vibrant economies ( including South Korea , Singapore , Malaysia , India , Vietnam , Japan , and Thailand ) are more ambitious in scope than previous bilateral deals . 
As large-scale regional free-trade arrangements take shape , the EU continues to signal unequivocal commitment to free trade through sophisticated bilateral agreements . 
But trade flows are vulnerable . 
Of course , economic relations between states foster interdependence , decreasing the risk of conflict . 
When the territorial dispute between Japan and China over the Senkaku / Diaoyu islands flared anew last year , Japanese auto exports to China plummeted 80 % in just three months . 
Herein lies Asia &apos;s specific paradox : a high level of economic integration has not given rise to regional institutions that can support the stability required for sustained prosperity . 
Instead , Asia remains deeply scarred by unsettled disputes , periodic fits of nationalism , and contested borders , all of which tend to be amplified by apprehension stemming from the asymmetric rise of some of its powers . 
Regional integration is a recipe for long-term stability in Asia , and a second line of engagement for the EU . 
In Europe , once torn apart by war , armed conflict among EU member states is now almost unthinkable . 
The EU &apos;s institutional architecture facilitated the pivot from devastating and recurrent wars to peace and prosperity . 
But creating that architecture is a daunting task , which has taken Europe decades and is still ongoing . 
Successive quandaries and crises have revealed the flaws in the EU &apos;s institutional design , and each ( painstaking ) upgrade has made the European project that much stronger . 
With no hint of paternalism , and recognizing its status as a work-in-progress , the EU should increase its engagement with Asia &apos;s existing structures and lend its know-how where possible - for example , in ASEAN &apos;s shift toward a three-pillared design ( political-military , economic , and socio-cultural ) by 2015 . 
On the global front , the EU and China may find themselves to be natural partners on key issues . 
China is facing increasing pressure ( particularly from the US ) to assume a global political role that corresponds to its economic weight . 
Here , China could find an excellent partner in Europe , either in a G-3 format with the US or in focused bilateral cooperation . 
Consider the Middle East . 
China and Europe might find common cause in the vacuum left as America &apos;s domestic energy revolution weakens its commitment to the region . 
As China &apos;s reliance on Middle East energy resources grows - 90 % of the region &apos;s oil exports will go to Asia by 2035 - the need to deepen engagement with oil-producing states will become more acute . 
Europe , the Middle East &apos;s experienced neighbor , could be China &apos;s strategic partner in this endeavor . 
Japan is another Asian giant regaining confidence , following Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s energetic stimulus program . 
As Japan takes unprecedented trade-liberalization steps in the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations with the US and other economies in Asia and the Americas , and boosts its regional engagement , Europe must maintain its strong ties with the world &apos;s third-largest national economy . 
The ambitious bilateral trade agreement now under construction is expected to boost exports in both directions by up to one-third . 
In any comprehensive strategy for engagement with Asia , the EU is only as strong as its parts . 
Though country-to-country engagement with Asia &apos;s rising powers may be tempting , and while China often prefers bilateral dealings , renationalization of EU members &quot; foreign policies would be counterproductive . 
A thickly woven cord is needed to keep Europe reliably anchored as it points eastward , whereas separate strands would withstand only a limited degree of strain in the turbulent years ahead .
