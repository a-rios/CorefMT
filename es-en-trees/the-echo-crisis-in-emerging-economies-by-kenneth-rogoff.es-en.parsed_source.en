Are Emerging Markets Submerging ? 
CAMBRIDGE - With economic growth slowing significantly in many major middle-income countries and asset prices falling sharply across the board , is the inevitable &quot; echo crisis &quot; in emerging markets already upon us ? 
After years of solid - and sometimes strong - output gains since the 2008 financial crisis , the combined effect of decelerating long-term growth in China and a potential end to ultra-easy monetary policies in advanced countries is exposing significant fragilities . 
The fact that relatively moderate shocks have caused such profound trauma in emerging markets makes one wonder what problems a more dramatic shift would trigger . 
Do emerging countries have the capacity to react , and what kind of policies would a new round of lending by the International Monetary Fund bring ? 
Has the eurozone crisis finally taught the IMF that public and private debt overhangs are significant impediments to growth , and that it should place much greater emphasis on debt write-downs and restructuring than it has in the past ? 
The market has been particularly brutal to countries that need to finance significant ongoing current-account deficits , such as Brazil , India , South Africa , and Indonesia . 
Fortunately , a combination of flexible exchange rates , strong international reserves , better monetary regimes , and a shift away from foreign-currency debt provides some measure of protection . 
Nonetheless , years of political paralysis and postponed structural reforms have created vulnerabilities . 
Of course , countries like Argentina and Venezuela were extreme in their dependence on favorable commodity prices and easy international financial conditions to generate growth . 
But the good times obscured weaknesses in many other countries as well . 
The growth slowdown is a much greater concern than the recent asset-price volatility , even if the latter grabs more headlines . 
Equity and bond markets in the developing world remain relatively illiquid , even after the long boom . 
Thus , even modest portfolio shifts can still lead to big price swings , perhaps even more so when traders are off on their August vacations . 
Until recently , international investors believed that expanding their portfolios in emerging markets was a no-brainer . 
The developing world was growing nicely , while the advanced countries were virtually stagnant . 
Businesses began to see a growing middle class that could potentially underpin not only economic growth but also political stability . 
Even countries ranked toward the bottom of global corruption indices - for example , Russia and Nigeria - boasted soaring middle-class populations and rising consumer demand . 
This basic storyline has not changed . 
But a narrowing of growth differentials has made emerging markets a bit less of a no-brainer for investors , and this is naturally producing sizable effects on these countries &quot; asset prices . 
A step toward normalization of interest-rate spreads - which quantitative easing has made exaggeratedly low - should not be cause for panic . 
The fallback in bond prices does not yet portend a repeat of the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980 &quot; s or the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990 &quot; s . 
Indeed , some emerging markets - for example , Colombia - had been issuing public debt at record-low interest-rate spreads over US treasuries . 
Their finance ministers , while euphoric at their countries &quot; record-low borrowing costs , must have understood that it might not last . 
Yes , there is ample reason for concern . 
For one thing , it is folly to think that more local-currency debt eliminates the possibility of a financial crisis . 
The fact that countries can resort to double-digit inflation rates and print their way out of a debt crisis is hardly reassuring . 
Decades of financial-market deepening would be undone , banks would fail , the poor would suffer disproportionately , and growth would falter . 
Alternatively , countries could impose stricter capital controls and financial-market regulations to lock in savers , as the advanced countries did after World War II . 
But financial repression is hardly painless and almost certainly reduces the allocative efficiency of credit markets , thereby impacting long-term growth . 
If the emerging-market slowdown were to turn into something worse , now or in a few years , is the world prepared ? 
Here , too , there is serious cause for concern . 
The global banking system is still weak in general , and particularly so in Europe . 
There is considerable uncertainty about how the IMF would approach an emerging-market crisis after its experience in Europe , where it has had to balance policies aimed at promoting badly needed structural change in the eurozone and those aimed at short-run economic preservation . 
That is a topic for another day , but the European experience has raised tough questions about whether the IMF has a double standard for European countries ( even those , like Greece , that are really emerging markets ) . 
It is to be hoped , of course , that things will not come to that . 
It seems unlikely that international investors will give up on emerging markets just yet , not when their long-term prospects still look much better than those of the advanced economies . 
Besides , the current sentiment that the eurozone has gotten past the worst seems exceedingly optimistic . 
There has been only very modest structural reform in countries like Italy and France . 
Fundamental questions , including how to operate a banking union in Europe , remain contentious . 
Spain &apos;s huge risk premium has almost disappeared , but its debt problems have not . 
Meanwhile , across the Atlantic , the political polarization in Washington is distressing , with another debt ceiling debacle looming . 
Today &apos;s retreat to advanced-country asset markets could quickly revert to retreat from them . 
The emerging-market slowdown ought to be a warning shot that something much worse could happen . 
One can only hope that if that day should ever arrive , the world will be better prepared than it is right now .
