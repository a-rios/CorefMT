A Trans-Atlantic Transition 
AUSTIN - Despite many calls for a &quot; new Atlanticism &quot; or a &quot; new transatlantic bargain , &quot; the US-European relationship remains imprisoned by old habits . 
After all , it is an inescapable reality that almost all of today &apos;s great challenges lie outside the traditional NATO relationship , and many are in areas where US and European views have long diverged . 
A meeting of minds on every global issue is too much to ask of both the US and Europe , but on many issues strategic convergence seems both possible and necessary . 
These include management of the global financial and trading system , addressing energy security and climate change , and re-fashioning existing international institutions to address these problems . 
Perhaps it has taken the global economic crisis to compel Americans and Europeans to revitalize their cooperation . 
With the International Monetary Fund sidelined at the start , the Europeans , led by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , called for a summit meeting of the G-20 to consider a new international financial architecture , bypassing not only the Fund , but the G-7 as well . 
This initiative , and the three G-20 summits that have followed , mark a promising start . 
With European and US leadership , several measures were undertaken to strengthen financial oversight and monitoring via the IMF and a Financial Stability Board that replaces the old Financial Stability Forum . 
The G-20 leaders also agreed to recapitalize the IMF and regional development banks via an impressive $ 1.1 trillion package of measures to assist the poorest countries . 
The essential next step is to bring the new economic powers more fully into the global system , and to have their growing power and influence reflected in the IMF , World Bank , and other institutions . 
The emerging-market economies account for 30 % of global GDP , 45 % of total exports , and 75 % of foreign exchange reserves , yet the traditional Western powers of the OECD continue to hold 63.8 % of the total voting shares in the IMF , with the G-7 alone constituting 43.7 % of the total . 
A good place to start would be for the US and Europe to give up their traditional claims to the top World Bank and IMF jobs . 
Likewise , emerging economic giants like China and India should be accorded substantially greater voting power . 
One possible formula would be for the US to relinquish its position as the sole country with veto power in exchange for the EU &apos;s agreement to reduce its combined voting share from 30 % to the same level as the US . 
So far , however , the US and the EU have been loath to relinquish their privileged positions . 
The global financial crisis also has contributed to a growing crisis of the world trading system , with governments responding to anti-globalization pressures by pursuing mercantilist policies . 
Bilateral and regional trade agreements have been proliferating , most of them the kinds of discriminatory trade deals that the US-led international order was designed to prevent . 
Meanwhile , the Doha Development Round risks becoming the first post-war multilateral trade negotiation to fail . 
Yet , despite their rhetorical commitments to completing the Doha round , neither the US nor any other economic power has done much to move it forward . 
In the US and elsewhere , the Doha round has sparked widespread opposition from workers and trade unions , and has elicited only tepid support from the wider public . 
It is , in short , the familiar story of gains being widely distributed while losses are sharply concentrated , usually by sector , and often by region . 
Reviving Doha will be possible only if the American public and Congress see large , headline-grabbing benefits that could offset opposition from those who stand to be adversely affected . 
A bold international move would be needed to overcome entrenched positions , and that means a deal involving substantial concessions by the US and the EU on agriculture in return for commensurate commitments by India , Brazil , China , and others to open their own markets for services and agriculture . 
With the Europeans , simultaneous pursuit of an &quot; enhanced transatlantic market &quot; would make a new US-EU Doha initiative on agriculture more attractive to both sides , as it would aim at reducing additional barriers to transatlantic trade that are not covered in the multilateral round . 
Another legacy of the outmoded international system is that the International Energy Agency includes none of the major energy-exporting countries . 
The US and Europe should take the lead in expanding the IEA &apos;s membership to include China , India , Russia , and other non-OECD countries , and in elevating it , along with an expanded Energy Charter Treaty , as a forum for energy security through negotiation among suppliers , consumers , and transit countries . 
The world is on the cusp of the most profound shift in global power and influence in a century . 
Managing this quiet revolution calls for nothing short of a new international system , with a radical revision of existing institutions and patterns of doing business . 
The existing international system , fashioned for the world of the mid-twentieth century , is not relevant to the new global agenda , and the emerging re-distribution of power roughly from West to East is unlikely to permit any new global order to be managed by a US-European condominium .
