America &apos;s Socialism for the Rich 
With all the talk of &quot; green shoots &quot; of economic recovery , America &apos;s banks are pushing back on efforts to regulate them . 
While politicians talk about their commitment to regulatory reform to prevent a recurrence of the crisis , this is one area where the devil really is in the details - and the banks will muster what muscle they have left to ensure that they have ample room to continue as they have in the past . 
The old system worked well for the bankers ( if not for their shareholders ) , so why should they embrace change ? 
Indeed , the efforts to rescue them devoted so little thought to the kind of post-crisis financial system we want that we will end up with a banking system that is less competitive , with the large banks that were too big too fail even larger . 
It has long been recognized that those America &apos;s banks that are too big to fail are also too big to be managed . 
Normally , when a bank fails , the government engineers a financial restructuring ; if it has to put in money , it , of course , gains a stake in the future . 
Officials know that if they wait too long , zombie or near zombie banks - with little or no net worth , but treated as if they were viable institutions - are likely to &quot; gamble on resurrection . &quot; 
If they take big bets and win , they walk away with the proceeds ; if they fail , the government picks up the tab . 
This is not just theory ; it is a lesson we learned , at great expense , during the Savings 
Loan crisis of the 1980 &quot; s . 
When the ATM machine says , &quot; insufficient funds , &quot; the government doesn &apos;t want this to mean that the bank , rather than your account , is out of money , so it intervenes before the till is empty . 
In a financial restructuring , shareholders typically get wiped out , and bondholders become the new shareholders . 
Sometimes , the government must provide additional funds ; sometimes it looks for a new investor to take over the failed bank . 
The Obama administration has , however , introduced a new concept : too big to be financially restructured . 
Markets would panic . 
So , not only can &apos;t we touch the bondholders , we can &apos;t even touch the shareholders - even if most of the shares &quot; existing value merely reflects a bet on a government bailout . 
I think this judgment is wrong . 
I think the Obama administration has succumbed to political pressure and scare-mongering by the big banks . 
As a result , the administration has confused bailing out the bankers and their shareholders with bailing out the banks . 
Restructuring gives banks a chance for a new start : new potential investors ( whether in equity or debt instruments ) will have more confidence , other banks will be more willing to lend to them , and they will be more willing to lend to others . 
The bondholders will gain from an orderly restructuring , and if the value of the assets is truly greater than the market ( and outside analysts ) believe , they will eventually reap the gains . 
But what is clear is that the Obama strategy &apos;s current and future costs are very high - and so far , it has not achieved its limited objective of restarting lending . 
The taxpayer has had to pony up billions , and has provided billions more in guarantees - bills that are likely to come due in the future . 
Rewriting the rules of the market economy - in a way that has benefited those that have caused so much pain to the entire global economy - is worse than financially costly . 
Most Americans view it as grossly unjust , especially after they saw the banks divert the billions intended to enable them to revive lending to payments of outsized bonuses and dividends . 
Tearing up the social contract is something that should not be done lightly . 
But this new form of ersatz capitalism , in which losses are socialized and profits privatized , is doomed to failure . 
Incentives are distorted . 
The too-big-to-be-restructured banks know that they can gamble with impunity - and , with the Federal Reserve making funds available at near-zero interest rates , there are ample funds to do so . 
Some have called this new economic regime &quot; socialism with American characteristics . &quot; 
But socialism is concerned about ordinary individuals . 
Workers who lose their jobs receive only 39 weeks of limited unemployment benefits , and are then left on their own . 
And , when they lose their jobs , most lose their health insurance , too . 
America has expanded its corporate safety net in unprecedented ways , from commercial banks to investment banks , then to insurance , and now to automobiles , with no end in sight . 
In truth , this is not socialism , but an extension of long standing corporate welfarism . 
The rich and powerful turn to the government to help them whenever they can , while needy individuals get little social protection . 
We need to break up the too-big-to-fail banks ; there is no evidence that these behemoths deliver societal benefits that are commensurate with the costs they have imposed on others . 
And , if we don &apos;t break them up , then we have to severely limit what they do . 
They can &apos;t be allowed to do what they did in the past - gamble at others &quot; expenses . 
This raises another problem with America &apos;s too-big-to-fail , too-big-to-be-restructured banks : they are too politically powerful . 
Their lobbying efforts worked well , first to deregulate , and then to have taxpayers pay for the cleanup . 
Their hope is that it will work once again to keep them free to do as they please , regardless of the risks for taxpayers and the economy . 
We cannot afford to let that happen .
