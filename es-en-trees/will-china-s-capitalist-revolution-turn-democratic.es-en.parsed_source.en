Will China &apos;s Capitalist Revolution Turn Democratic 
Communist China has experienced a monumental capitalist revolution in the last two decades , with an economy that is now six times bigger than it was 20 years ago . 
A minor player in the global economy in the 1980 &quot; s , China today is the world &apos;s third largest trading power . 
Most Westerners believe in a theory of liberal evolution , according to which sustained economic growth , by increasing wealth and the size of the middle class , gradually makes a country more democratic . 
While the long-run record of this theory is irrefutable , China &apos;s authoritarian ruling elite is not only determined to hold on to power , but it also has been smart enough to take adaptive measures aimed at countering the liberalizing effects of economic development . 
Thus , for all its awe-inspiring economic achievement , China has made remarkably little progress in political liberalization . 
Indeed , judging by several key indicators , progress toward democracy in China has stalled , despite unprecedented economic prosperity and personal freedom . 
For instance , in the mid-1980 &quot; s , Chinese leaders seriously discussed and later drew up a blueprint for modest democratic reforms . 
Today , the topic of political reform is taboo . 
Nearly all the major institutional reforms , such as strengthening the legislature , holding village elections , and building a modern legal system , were launched in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Since the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989 , however , not a single major democratic reform initiative has been implemented . 
Instead of democratic transition , China has witnessed a consolidation of authoritarian rule - the strengthening of a one-party regime through organizational learning and adaptation . 
Since 1989 , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) has been pursuing a two-pronged strategy : selective repression that targets organized political opposition and co-optation of new social elites ( the intelligentsia , professionals , and private entrepreneurs ) . 
This strategy emphasizes the maintenance of an extensive law enforcement apparatus designed to eliminate any incipient organized opposition . 
Huge investments have strengthened the People &apos;s Armed Police ( PAP ) , a large anti-riot paramilitary force whose specialty is the quick suppression of anti-government protests by disgruntled industrial workers , peasants , and urban residents . 
Frequent deployment of the PAP is a major reason why the tens of thousands of collective protests that occur each year ( 74,000 in 2004 and 86,000 in 2005 ) have had a negligible impact on China &apos;s overall stability . 
To deal with new emerging political threats , such as the information revolution , the Chinese government has spent mightily on manpower and technology . 
A special 30,000-strong police unit monitors and screens Internet traffic , advanced technology is deployed to block access to overseas Web sites considered &quot; hostile or harmful , &quot; and Internet service and content providers , both domestic and Western , must comply with onerous restrictions designed to suppress political dissent and track down offenders . 
The regime has even conducted multi-agency exercises to test whether different government bodies could cooperate closely to keep &quot; harmful information &quot; off the Net during an emergency . 
Having learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union that a bureaucratic ruling party must co-opt new social elites to deprive potential opposition groups of leaders , the Communist Party has conducted an effective campaign of expanding its social base . 
The urban intelligentsia and professionals have been pampered with material perks and political recognition , while new private entrepreneurs have been allowed to join the Party . 
This strategy of pre-emptive political decapitation has produced enormous dividends for the Party . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , its principal adversaries were the urban intelligentsia , who constituted the backbone of the pro-democracy movement that culminated in Tiananmen Square . 
Today , the mainstream of the Chinese intelligentsia is an integral part of the ruling elite . 
Many have joined the Party and become government officials , and a large percentage enjoy various professional and financial privileges . 
Predictably , the intelligentsia , usually the most liberal social group , is no longer a lethal threat to party rule . 
Worse , without support from this strategic group , other social groups , such as workers and peasants , have become politically marginalized and rudderless . 
Although the Party &apos;s carrot-and-stick approach has worked since 1989 , it is doubtful that it will retain its efficacy for another 17 years . 
To the extent that China &apos;s authoritarian regime is by nature exclusionary ( it can only incorporate a limited number of elites ) , the co-optation strategy will soon run up against its limits , and the Party will no longer have the resources to buy off the intelligentsia or keep private entrepreneurs happy . 
At the same time , selective repression can contain social frustrations and discontent only temporarily . 
As long as much of Chinese society views the current political system as unjust , unresponsive , and corrupt , there will always be a large reservoir of ill will toward the ruling elites . 
When things go wrong - as is likely , given mounting social strains caused by rising inequality , environmental degradation , and deteriorating public services - China &apos;s alienated masses could become politically radicalized . 
So it may be premature for the Party to celebrate the success of its adaptive strategy . 
China &apos;s rulers may have stalled democratic trends for now , but the current strategy has , perhaps , merely delayed the inevitable .
