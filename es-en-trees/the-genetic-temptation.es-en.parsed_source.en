The Genetic Temptation 
A gene for social skills , we are told , has now entered the fast growing Pantheon of genes &quot; for &quot; various human behaviors and dispositions - taking its place alongside genes for risk-taking , happiness , aggression , and sexual orientation , among others . 
One gets the impression that we are well on the way to figuring ourselves out , and that we are far simpler than anyone imagined . 
After all , adeptness at cocktail party conversation - or addiction to the cocktails - may be no less genetically determined than hair color . 
Defining the role that genes play in behavior , however , is not so easy . 
Many of the results of human studies are highly preliminary and do not actually identify a gene . 
In fact , they cannot , for genetic experimentation on humans is impossible . 
Even in animals whose genes are more easily studied and much better understood , such as Drosophila , the tiny fruit fly , there is no simple one-to-one correspondence between gene and behavioral trait . 
Instead , a wide variety of genes influence each characteristic . 
Fruit fly genes are surprisingly similar to ours - as they are to those of most other creatures . 
Even many aspects of their behavior resemble our own . 
For example , when training a fruit fly to prefer one odor to another in a simple learning task , it will remember better if trained at repeated intervals over a long time rather than in one intense session . 
Fruit flies are not geniuses , but &quot; cramming &quot; works no better for them than it does for us . 
Even more recently , scientists at the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego have shown that according to all essential definitional criteria , fruit flies sleep at night . 
But those of us who study how genes affect behavior are humbled by the fruit fly &apos;s complexity . 
Moreover , fruit flies exhibit this complexity under conditions in which &quot; nurture &quot; is kept constant - a condition that is never true of humans . 
If the relationship between fruit fly genes and behavior is so complex , can it be any less so with humans ? 
The view that an individual gene could account for a complete biological trait is as old as genetics itself . 
Whether describing genes for the color of flowers in pea plants or the shape of the fruit fly &apos;s wings , geneticists at the beginning of the last century believed that each gene governed one unique characteristic . 
Soon , a few of the early geneticists , founders of the Eugenics movement , made the odious assertion that &quot; licentiousness , &quot; &quot; shiftlessness , &quot; and &quot; criminality &quot; could all be attributed to individual genes as well . 
As time passed and scientific knowledge accumulated - much of it from the fruit fly - the true complexity of the relationship between genes and characteristics became clear . 
By the 1920s , most geneticists had abandoned the idea of a single gene for each characteristic and were loath to ascribe human behavior solely to genes . 
Those in the Eugenics movement remained hold-outs , convinced that the salvation of the human race would be found in limiting the birth-rate of those they deemed to be genetically &quot; unfit . &quot; 
We are now in the midst of an explosion of genetic information . 
New technologies are uncovering more genes every day and comprehensive lists have been drawn up for worms , mice , and humans . 
But these species &apos; behavior , no less than that of the fruit fly , is the product of a vast array of genes , none of which acts in isolation . 
Genes influence each other and are in turn influenced by the surrounding world . 
The result is always a unique individual . 
The reason for this is simple . 
Any creature that reproduces sexually is made up of a unique combination of its species &apos; gene set , which it inherits from its parents . 
All humans , for example , have the same set of genes - the same genetic context - but not exactly the same versions of each gene . 
( The exceptions to this in any species are identical twins and clones . ) 
These slight variations are part of what makes each of us different from other members of our species . 
The importance of genetic context has been shown in studies of behavioral mutants in fruit flies and mice . 
The same mutation may have a strong effect in one genetic context but not in another . 
Beyond genetics , all creatures experience a non-identical sequence of life events . 
This is as true for genetically identical bacteria growing in a uniform environment as it is for a person living in Paris , Tokyo , Moscow or Buenos Aires . 
Granted , the differences between any two Muscovites &apos; experiences are greater than the differences between the experiences of any two bacteria in a test tube culture . 
But that is just the point . 
Genetically identical bacteria represent an extreme case . 
We expect them to be uniform . 
So if contingency holds for them , then it certainly holds for us . 
Genes enable life , but they clearly do not determine it . 
So the real issue is not whether we humans are servants of our genes , but rather our infatuation with the idea that our behavior could so easily be explained and predicted . 
Perhaps we should not be so eager to be relieved of the burden of reflection , evaluation , and choice - in short , of grappling with what lies at the true heart of our humanity .
