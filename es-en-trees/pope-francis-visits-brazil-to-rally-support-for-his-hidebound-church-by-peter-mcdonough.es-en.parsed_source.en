The Real Mission for Pope Francis 
GLENDALE , CALIFORNIA - Catholicism , among the most tradition-bound religions , contains at its core a paradox that has become increasingly sharp . 
As Pope Francis begins his first overseas trip - to Brazil , the world &apos;s most populous Catholic country - it is difficult , despite the inertia of the past , to tell where the church is headed . 
The accession of Jorge Mario Bergoglio to the papacy adds to the puzzle . 
The chief Jesuit confessor at the papal court used to be called &quot; the black pope , &quot; owing to his simple black cassock ( if not his sinister intent ) . 
Now , for the first time , a Jesuit has become pope - and has compounded the novelty by assuming the very un-Jesuit name of Francis . 
As curious as such gestures are in an institution that thrives on imagery , they are symbolic frills . 
We already have plenty of pictures of Francis kissing babies ; what he faces now - in Brazil and around the world - are strategic matters of genuine substance . 
One such challenge , the Vatican Bank , is equivalent to cleaning up the Augean stables . 
It is enough to mention the words &quot; Vatican &quot; and &quot; bank &quot; in the same sentence to start a cascade of jokes about comic-opera ineptness and skullduggery . 
In order to find a remedy , Francis has appointed a special papal financial commission . 
But the bank known as the Institute for Works of Religion , founded in 1942 , does not have deep roots in Catholicism . 
Though notoriously secretive , the operation is far removed from the Church &apos;s more sensitive , doctrinal core . 
Besides , the commission &apos;s members have impeccable loyalist credentials , which is also true of the cardinals appointed by Francis to look into broader issues of reform . 
At the same time , Francis has launched a series of initiatives aimed at pleasing just about everyone . 
He has expedited the canonization process for John XXIII , who inaugurated Vatican II almost a half-century ago , and John Paul II , the autocratic Pole who reined in many of Vatican II &apos;s liberating impulses . 
He has also announced plenary indulgences - time off from &quot; the pains of purgatory &quot; - for those who follow his visit to the Catholic youth festival in Rio de Janeiro on the Internet . 
Such measures are difficult to get worked up about - both for Catholics who do not take them seriously and for &quot; the simple faithful . &quot; 
They have feel-good value , but little else . 
The heart of the matter is that Francis &apos;s actions have been in line with the &quot; revolution from above &quot; style of reform associated with Vatican II . 
In particular , none of the changes promoted by Francis envision a reduction in papal power . 
The &quot; primacy of the papacy &quot; - a term Catholic theologians use when talking with their Protestant counterparts - remains sacrosanct . 
The larger lesson is that this monarchical model of Catholicism , together with the hierarchy that attends it , has remained pretty much the same since the Counter-Reformation . 
For example , when priests leave &quot; holy orders , &quot; they are &quot; reduced to the lay state &quot; - a bit of condescending terminology that says a lot about the Church &apos;s archaic mindset . 
This is not a new situation . 
What is new are the circumstances under which it is unfolding . 
Catholicism in its heyday combined a fairly decentralized administration , under the sway of stand-alone bishops , with a uniform set of beliefs . 
One reason why it used to take roughly 13 years for a Jesuit to reach ordination was the long indoctrination in orthodoxy required for priests who , unlike &quot; regular clergy &quot; ( whose training lasted half that time ) , would be mobile and beyond the direct control of bishops . 
This situation is now close to being reversed . 
Church administration has become increasingly subject to uniform civil codes . 
At the same time , since Vatican II - and in tandem with the decline of close-knit ethnic enclaves - churchgoers no longer feel obliged to hew to the letter of canon law . 
&quot; Relativism , &quot; &quot; cafeteria Catholicism , &quot; and the like are ubiquitous . 
Papal authority stands on shaky ground , especially in the comparatively secular West . 
Francis can attract attention by opining about social justice outside the church , but it is difficult for any pope to influence the habits and theological views of Catholics themselves , who think and act as they please . 
He can scold - a tack that Francis has so far tried to avoid - but he cannot convince . 
If the Church &apos;s first dilemma concerns the basis and effectiveness of papal authority , the second concerns sexuality . 
The two are linked . 
Francis shies away from the retrograde rhetoric that his predecessors used in raising alarms about the role of women , and he has not gone out of his way to follow up on the Vatican &apos;s &quot; visitation &quot; ( read &quot; Inquisition &quot; ) of uppity American nuns . 
But he has kept that last episode on the books , and he continues to wax traditional about homosexuality . 
Catholicism - or , more accurately , the celibate male mythos at the heart of the institutional church - rests on centuries of sexism . 
An antifeminist culture pervades the organization . 
Thoughtful theologians can distinguish among psycho-sexual issues ; in practice , however , fear of a slippery slope to calamity prevails . 
Pull one thread - the celibacy requirement for priests , for example - and the whole edifice comes crashing down . 
Consider what has happened to liberalizing Protestant denominations , which , for all their good intentions , have lost adherents . 
One could argue that concessions on this front would simply acknowledge attitudinal and behavioral reality and allow the church to move on . 
One could also argue that the consequences of reform would not be as organizationally disastrous as feared - in the same way that cleaning up backwaters like the Vatican Bank would restore credibility to the Church &apos;s spiritual message . 
But this is a conversation that Francis has yet to initiate , and that the people around him show little sign of understanding .
