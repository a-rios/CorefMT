Bottom Dollar 
As more time passes with neither the value of the dollar declining sharply nor market forces beginning to shrink America &apos;s current-account deficit - which may well reach $ 1 trillion this year - two diametrically opposed reactions are emerging . 
Most international finance economists are becoming increasingly frightened that a major international financial crisis could erupt . 
Indeed , they fear that the scale of that potential crisis is becoming larger and larger . 
Others - especially managers of financial assets - are becoming increasingly convinced that economists don &apos;t know very much , and that what they do know is of no use to traders like themselves . 
They see little reason to believe that current asset values and trade flows are not sustainable . 
After all , they ( or some of them ) argue , the real GDP of the United States is growing by $ 400 billion per year , with about $ 270 billion going to labor and $ 130 billion to capital . 
Even after depreciation , that $ 130 billion of extra annual income is capitalized at about $ 1.5 trillion of wealth , so the current-account deficit , even at $ 1 trillion , is not overwhelmingly large . 
We Americans can sell off two-thirds of the increment to our wealth to finance imports and still be $ 500 billion better off this year than we were last year . 
Moreover , the annual interest charged on the extra $ 1 trillion per year that Americans borrow from the rest of the world is about $ 50 billion - just one-eighth of annual economic growth , while the trade deficit is financed out of the growth of the value of capital . 
So what &apos;s unsustainable ? 
Why can &apos;t the US current-account deficit remain at its 2006 value indefinitely ? 
The counterargument hinges on the difference between the current-account deficit and the trade deficit . 
The current-account deficit is equal to the trade deficit plus the cost of servicing the net international asset position : the net rent , interest , and dividends owed to foreigners who have invested their capital in the US . 
As time passes , deficits accumulate . 
Thus , in order to keep the current-account deficit stable , the trade deficit must shrink . 
And the only way for the trade deficit to shrink substantially is for net imports to fall , which requires either a relatively sharp decline in the value of the dollar , thereby raising import prices , or a depression in the US . 
As a result , holders of dollar-denominated assets should be looking forward to two alternative scenarios . 
In one , the value of the dollar will be low ; in the other , the US will be in a depression . 
In neither scenario does it make sense to hold huge amounts of dollar-denominated assets today . 
But foreign-currency speculators and international investors are not looking forward to either of these scenarios . 
They continue to hold very large positions in dollar-denominated assets , which they would not do if they thought the US faced a choice between a cheap dollar and a deep depression . 
So , what alternative does the market see ? 
And why is it so different from the possible scenarios that international financial economists see ? 
The answer appears to be that there is nobody in the financial centers of New York , London , Tokyo , Frankfurt , and Hong Kong who thinks it is their business to bet on a future flight from the dollar . 
Especially in times of crisis - and a sharp fall in US imports would imply a much more severe crisis for Asian and European exporters than it would for the US - the dollar is a currency that you run to , not from . 
George Soros can bet on a run on the British pound . 
Thai import-export firms can bet on a run on the baht by accelerating their dollar receipts and delaying their dollar payouts . 
Everyone can bet on a run on the Argentine peso - a favorite sport of international financial speculators for a century and a half . 
But not the dollar . 
Not yet . 
In other words , the market is betting that the dollar will fall gradually in the next five years , and that the US current-account deficit will narrow without a financial crisis . 
That is what happened in the late 1980 &quot; s , and in the late 1970 &quot; s , too . 
After all , God , it is said , protects children , fools , dogs , and the United States of America . 
But the odds on a soft landing are lengthening with each passing day .
