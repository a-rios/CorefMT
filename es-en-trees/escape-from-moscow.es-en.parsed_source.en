Escape from Moscow 
Communism &apos;s fall gave the nations of the former Soviet bloc a chance to turn towards democracy , a market economy , and the rule of law . 
Some countries cut ties decisively with the communist past ; others were less successful , a few failed catastrophically . 
Moldova and Georgia were in the last category until recently . 
Their economic and political failures were in large part due to secessionist movements - actively supported by Russia - that aimed at keeping both countries in the Kremlin &apos;s &quot; sphere of influence . &quot; 
When bloody conflicts erupted in Transdnistria , Abkhazia , and South-Ossetia , Russia turned its military presence into &quot; peace-keeping &quot; forces as a means of maintaining control . 
It has long been feared that these so-called &quot; frozen conflicts &quot; could suddenly turn hot . 
Not only has this not happened , but we can now talk of solutions , as both Georgia and Moldova have begun to achieve breakthroughs to a market economy and democracy . 
The European Union &apos;s &quot; neighborhood policy &quot; has also helped . 
The starting point for these developments was Georgia &apos;s &quot; Rose Revolution &quot; three years ago . 
From coming perilously close to being a failed state , Georgia has turned towards the West . 
The success of the various &quot; color revolutions &quot; in former Soviet-bloc countries also ignited change in Moldova , where President Vladimir Voronin launched reforms aimed at moving closer to the EU . 
These changes sparked new initiatives in Georgia and in Moldova to restore , peacefully , their territorial integrity . 
Estonia &apos;s experience suggests how Georgia and Moldova should shape their policies vis-à-vis Russia . 
When Estonia gained independence in 1991 , Moscow sought to portray Estonia as a land with huge economic problems , unsuitable for investment . 
Estonia was indeed poor , and its main exports were scrap metal and timber , but its economy was growing . 
Russia supported a so-called &quot; autonomy-movement &quot; in northeast Estonia , which is populated mostly by ethnic Russians who settled there during Soviet times . 
When Estonia resisted , Russia imposed sanctions and cut off gas supplies . 
The few Estonian products allowed into Russia were heavily taxed , and Russia even threatened military intervention . 
But Estonia kept its nerve . 
Russian sanctions actually helped Estonia re-direct its economy westward . 
Meanwhile , Western Europe did its utmost to integrate the Baltic states - Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia − while seeking to avoid conflict with Russia . 
A 1994 free-trade treaty with the EU enabled Estonian products to find new markets , and Estonia eventually became one of the most successful postcommunist transition countries , joining the EU and NATO in 2004 . 
When Georgia gained independence in 1991 , it did not receive the same sort of help from Western Europe . 
True , Georgia seemed a less appealing partner than the Baltic states . 
The 1990 &quot; s were marked by coups , countercoups , and civil wars , with two regions - Abkhazia and South Ossetia - essentially breaking away with Russian support . 
The country has done its best to live down it dismal past . 
Since the Rose Revolution , the economy has been reformed , the army has been strengthened , and the country &apos;s leadership is young , dynamic , and eager to move the country forward . 
Georgia &apos;s 12 % flat-rate income tax - probably the lowest in the world - has boosted the national budget . 
The government has raised pensions and increased social support . 
Corruption is decreasing and judicial reform has started . 
The economy grew by 8 % in 2005 and more than 10 % in 2006 . 
Georgia has tried to defuse tensions over Abkhazia and South Ossetia , but Russia accuses Georgia of aggression and ethnic cleansing . 
Its main goal is to inhibit Western support for Georgia , and to prevent reconciliation with the breakaway regions . 
Russia , and to some extent the United States , are the powers that matter in Georgia . 
Europe must show that it matters , too . 
Estonia demonstrated - at independence and again during the recent crisis over the movement of a Soviet-era memorial - that with determination and strong support , Russian pressure can be resisted . 
Europe must understand that Georgia does not need humanitarian aid , but trade . 
Just as a free-trade deal with Europe allowed Estonia to find new markets , it can be the means through which Georgians are able to help themselves . 
Georgia can reasonably hope that it will achieve real independence , but what about Moldova , Europe &apos;s poorest country and one threatened by Russia more than the Estonians - or , indeed , the Georgians - ever were ? 
Moldova &apos;s lack of success at reform was partly the result of Russian-supported secessionist movements . 
It made a wretched start at independence when the industrial region of Transdnistria - populated by Russian and Ukrainian speakers who feared that the majority of Moldovans , who are of Romanian descent , planned closer ties with Romania - declared independence . 
Civil war followed , and in 1992 Russian troops entered Transdnistria , where they remain . 
Transdnistria &apos;s independence has never been recognized , either by Moldova or internationally . 
It is said to be lawless and corrupt . 
Moldova is deeply in debt , unemployment is high , and its once well-regarded wine industry is in decline . 
Russia occasionally cuts off its gas , and many of its four million people have left the country . 
Only Russia can solve the problem . 
Moldovan officials have made five fruitless visits to Moscow to plead with President Vladimir Putin to explore a solution and withdraw Russian troops . 
A desperate Voronin has turned for help to the EU &apos;s &quot; border assistance mission , &quot; but an EU initiative would need Russian cooperation . 
Unfortunately , the West appears to lack up-to-date knowledge about the situation in Moldova . 
In April , for example , the EU and the US too learned of a proposed peace deal only from a leaked report in Germany . 
That deal would appear to favor Russia , with Moldova recognizing Transdnistria as a legitimate entity . 
If Russia has trumped the West , the precedent for Georgia and other weak post-Soviet states would be a dire one .
