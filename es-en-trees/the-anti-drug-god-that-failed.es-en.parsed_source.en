The Anti-Drug God that Failed 
Russians and Ukrainians are once again being made victims of a utopian dream . 
Since the end of communism in 1991 , these countries ( and others ) have experienced a dramatic increase in the use of illicit drugs . 
They have responded with draconian policies that mirror the simplistic message of a drug-free society espoused by UN drug treaties and the institutions that seek to enforce them . 
Today , these policies are contributing to an explosion of HIV infections in much of the developing world . 
The UN treaties that guide global drug policy reflect none of the recent findings on drug use and addiction . 
Indeed , most UN drug conventions were enacted long before the appearance of HIV / AIDS - a disease fuelled by injection drug use in the former Soviet Union and many parts of Asia . 
Consider Russia and Ukraine , which have the world &apos;s fastest-growing rate of HIV infection . 
The number of people infected with HIV in Russia and Ukraine has increased by more than 18 times over the past five years . 
As many as 1.5 million Russians and 400,000 Ukrainians are estimated to have HIV ; at least 85 % of known infections are attributed to intravenous drug use . 
Governments in Russia and Ukraine allocate the bulk of their drug-related resources to law enforcement in a misguided attempt to comply with the UN drug treaties . 
Individual users suffer police abuse and are driven away from vital health and treatment services . 
Meanwhile , the flow of drugs continues undiminished . 
Repressive policies have never succeeded in eliminating demand for drugs . 
They do not tackle any of the economic , social , or health factors associated with the use of illicit drugs . 
Locking up drug users is not a solution - in Russia , it is easier to score drugs in prison than outside . 
Moreover , in a repressive climate , drug users who avoid arrest are more likely to face increased discrimination , reducing their motivation to take measures to protect their own health and the health of those around them . 
In such circumstances - without hope for a better future or the opportunity for compassion-based interaction with society - drug use and HIV spread rapidly . 
Russia and Ukraine are not alone in facing these twin epidemics . 
Pakistan , Iran , China , the Central Asian countries , and other places with rising rates of intravenous drug use are bound for the same public health catastrophe if they pursue similar discredited policies . 
Public health intervention to reduce the damage caused by drugs has been proven - by decades of research in dozens of countries - to be vastly more effective at lowering HIV infection rates and healthcare costs . 
Using a conservative model , the British medical journal Lancet estimated that the US would have recorded net savings of $ 500 million if it had implemented a national syringe exchange program between 1987-1995 . 
Similarly , an international survey found that HIV infection among intravenous drug users decreased by 5.8 % per year in cities with syringe exchange programs , and increased by 5.9 % per year in cities without such programs . 
No major study has shown that syringe exchange programs increase rates of drug use . 
Indeed , studies in the US , Australia , and elsewhere show that drug treatment rates tend to remain steady or rise , because syringe exchange participants gain greater access to rehabilitative care . 
UN agencies such as the Commission on Narcotic Drugs or the Office on Drugs and Crime are not mandated to prescribe specific drug strategies . 
However , their narrowly focused anti-drug stance strongly influences the policies and practices of member nations . 
Many individual governments , obsessed with compliance , are unable or unwilling to consider the negative public health effects of harsh anti-drug policies . 
International institutions chose to look the other way in the 1990 &apos;s as HIV / AIDS killed millions in Africa , infecting more than 25 % of the population in some countries . 
Because of similar ignorance , this terrible epidemic now looms over the former Soviet Union and other regions . 
Have we really learned nothing ? 
It is not too late for international and national policymakers to reconsider their strategies . 
In defiance of the UN conventions , some countries have adopted more pragmatic approaches to dealing with drug use and HIV . 
By treating drug use first and foremost as a problem of public health , nations can fight the spread of HIV far more effectively . 
To achieve this , they should take the following steps : 
· Adopt anti-discrimination and equal-protection laws to guarantee the civil liberties and human rights of drug users and people living with HIV ; 
· Acknowledge drug use as a public health issue , not a law-and-order issue , with government policies reflecting this reality ; 
· Explicitly legalize needle exchange and the use of methadone and other &quot; substitute &quot; medications for treatment ; 
· Create national programs that encompass a full range of pragmatic , inclusive , and accessible harm reduction services , from education and drug treatment to substitution therapy and needle exchange ; 
· Include drug users and their advocates in developing policies on drug use at both international and national levels . 
Continuing resistance to calls to restructure anti-drug strategies and goals will only worsen the HIV epidemic and contribute to the deaths of millions of vulnerable people .
