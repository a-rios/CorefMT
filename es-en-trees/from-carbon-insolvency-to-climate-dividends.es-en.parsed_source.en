From Carbon Insolvency to Climate Dividends 
BERLIN - Limiting global warming to 2 ° C above pre-industrial levels is absolutely crucial , says the G-8 and most of the world &apos;s best climatologists . 
If this is to be more than lip service , the consequences will be radical . 
For starters , until 2050 , only a total of around 700 gigatons of carbon dioxide can be emitted into the atmosphere . 
At the current rate of emissions , this &quot; budget &quot; will be exhausted in 20 years ; if emissions increase as expected , the world will become carbon &quot; insolvent &quot; even sooner . 
So reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions must begin as quickly as possible . 
Wasting any more time will cause costs to skyrocket and render the 2 ° limit obsolete . 
The rich North cannot continue as before , emerging industrial countries must leave the old industrial-based path to prosperity , and the rest of the world may not even embark upon it . 
Yet the negotiations on emissions limits with each of the 192 signatory countries in the run-up to the Copenhagen Summit in December 2009 have so far given no indication of so radical a change . 
A global climate deal must be simpler , fairer , and more flexible than is today &apos;s Kyoto Protocol . 
To achieve this , the Global Change Council of Germany ( WGBU ) suggests that a budget formula be adopted . 
The idea is that , in the future , all states will be allocated a national per-capita emissions budget that links three core elements of a fair global climate deal : the major industrial countries &quot; historical responsibility , individual countries &quot; current performance capacity , and global provision for the survival of mankind . 
The task is immense . 
On a global level , quick and comprehensive de-carbonization of the world economy is necessary . All countries must reduce their use of fossil fuels and switch to renewable energy sources as soon and as much as possible . 
But , since the OECD-countries ( led by the United States and Australia ) will soon overrun their carbon budgets even after far-reaching emissions reductions , they must cooperate with developing countries that still have budget surpluses . 
Breaking the Gordian knot of climate negotiations requires offering technology and financial transfers in exchange for the ability to overrun a national budget . 
A responsible global climate policy thus entails a fundamental change of international relations , and making the necessary institutional innovations in global governance requires courage . 
Until now , the wealth of nations has been based upon the combustion of coal , gas , and oil . 
For the moment , all this is still utopian . 
In its current state , cap-and-trade schemes to reduce emissions are far from being fair and effective ; a major improvement would include establishing a Central Climate Bank to register and supervise the transfer of emissions credits . 
This bank would also ensure that emissions trading did not run counter to the goal of remaining within the entire global budget , for example via the complete sale of unused emissions credits by individual developing countries at the beginning of the contract period . 
That , in turn , implies that it is accountable and that it has democratic legitimacy - something fundamentally lacking in multilateral agencies such as the World Bank . 
Additional changes to global governance will also be needed . 
In this framework , the old G-7 / 8 can no longer function as a hegemonic center , but rather as a kind of broker and preparatory body . 
Simultaneously , within a variable architecture of negotiation , there must be links to the numerous conference institutions of the United Nations , as well as to political-economic regional associations such as the EU , Mercosur , or the African Union . 
This flexible ( and , alas , fragile ) architecture of multi-level negotiation can function only as long as it is oriented towards clear moral bases for negotiation , has sufficient democratic legitimacy , and is supported in national and local arenas of action . 
Global leaders will find it significantly easier to steer towards big cooperation targets if they are supported by visions of the future within civil society . 
A low-carbon society is not a crisis scenario , but rather the realistic vision of liberation from the path of expensive and risky over-development . 
In 1963 , when the world narrowly escaped nuclear catastrophe , the physicist Max Born wrote : &quot; World peace in a world that has grown smaller is no longer a Utopia , but rather a necessity , a condition for the survival of mankind . &quot; 
Those words have never been truer .
