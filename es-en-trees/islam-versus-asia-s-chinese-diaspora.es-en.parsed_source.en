Islam versus Asia \ u0027s Chinese Diaspora 
When Malaysia &apos;s prime minister , Dr Mahathir Mohamed , recently announced that he intended to resign , Malaysians of Chinese descent joined Mahathir &apos;s Malay party loyalists in demanding that he reconsider . 
When Mahathir agreed to stay on , if only for another 16 months , the sighs of relief from these Chinese Malaysians were the loudest of all . 
That ethnic Chinese Malaysians rallied to Dr. Mahathir &apos;s side marks a quiet revolution in Malaysian politics , one that demonstrates how much Mahathir &apos;s nationalist image has softened during his 22 years in power . 
It also shows how much Malaysia &apos;s ethnic Chinese have changed in their views about the nationalist movement that once seemed so antagonistic to them . 
When Southeast Asia &apos;s colonial rulers were overthrown four decades ago , ethnic Chinese often shunned the nationalist movements that fought for independence . 
Some movements saw the local Chinese as outsiders or as intrinsically disloyal for seeming to have benefited disproportionately during the years of imperial rule . 
Across the region , anti-Chinese communal violence was widespread . 
In the decades since , many Chinese remained suspicious of political parties with ties to the former national liberation movements . 
In Malaysia , that fear is dissipating . 
Malaysia &apos;s Chinese citizens now view Premier Mahathir as a bastion against a new form of violent extremism : the threat posed by Muslim fundamentalism . 
Such a bulwark is something members of the vast Chinese diaspora across Southeast Asia need , not only in Malaysia , where Islamic extremism remains a small threat , but in Indonesia , where thousands of Chinese have been killed and injured in rioting in recent years , and where thousands more have seen their property damaged or lost . 
Among most of Southeast Asia &apos;s ethnic Chinese , the presence of even a hint of allegiance to a secular distinction between faith and state in a Muslim leader is admired like a precious gem . 
When found among Islamic believers like Mahathir , evidence of secular tolerance represents a rare sign of modernity and commitment to progress . 
Dr. Mahathir has always been a hard-headed modernist . 
Lately , he has begun to admit that the &quot; Malay first &quot; policies he has promoted since 1969 have failed to produce the skilled Malay elite essential to a modern knowledge economy . 
Mahathir calls for young Malays to work harder , despite knowing that this is an unpopular thing to say . 
Much of this new tone in Malaysia &apos;s ethnic politics has gone unnoticed due to the furor surrounding Mahathir &apos;s efforts to discredit his former deputy , Anwar Ibrahim . 
This campaign to denigrate Mr. Anwar cost Mahathir &apos;s party , the United Malay National Organization ( UMNO ) , much support among ethnic Malays . 
Indeed , during the 1999 national elections , Mahathir retained power only with the help of Chinese voters . 
Now non-Malays hope that he will reconsider the idea of special treatment for ethnic Malays . 
Such reform , however , remains anathema among Malays . 
Malaysia &apos;s ethnic Chinese are also impressed by Dr. Mahathir &apos;s skillful response to American demands to combat terrorism . 
The Premier used this opportunity to soften his anti-Western image by re-affirming his modernist and secular position against those who sympathized with Islamic extremism . 
By doing so he revitalized the multi-cultural base of the National Alliance that has ruled Malaysia since independence in 1957 . 
All of this helped rally Malaysia &apos;s Chinese community to his side . 
Contrast this with the Chinese in Indonesia , a country where everything secular and modern is associated with political and cultural conformity to the nation-state . 
For thirty years , former President Suharto systematically discriminated against ethnic Chinese , while at the same time favoring a few select Chinese cronies , who helped his family and military colleagues make huge , ill-gotten profits . 
For the indigenous majority who remained poor , such cronyism spawned an image of the Chinese as corrupt and unscrupulously greedy . 
Despite memories of the slaughter of Chinese during the anti-communist purges of the 1960s , Indonesia &apos;s Chinese were unprepared for the intense hatred shown in the riots of May 1998 , when arson and looting , as well as gang rapes of numerous Chinese women , battered the Chinese community . 
Such violence still casts a shadow over ethnic relations in Indonesia . 
Successive Indonesian governments headed by Presidents Habibie , Abdulrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri all welcomed the Chinese to play their customary leading role in business . 
Yet Indonesian officials waver from assuring the Chinese that they retain equal rights as citizens , and they have allowed various forms of discrimination to run rampant . 
Today &apos;s tensions between Indonesia &apos;s secularists , religious believers , and various Muslim extremist groups has taken the spotlight off the Chinese , allowing many to resume their economic role under conditions of growing uncertainty . 
But the personal security they crave , and which Malaysia &apos;s ethnic Chinese are achieving , is as far away as ever . 
Indeed , Indonesia is unlikely any time soon to produce a leader they can depend upon in ways that Malaysia &apos;s Chinese now rely upon Premier Mahathir .
