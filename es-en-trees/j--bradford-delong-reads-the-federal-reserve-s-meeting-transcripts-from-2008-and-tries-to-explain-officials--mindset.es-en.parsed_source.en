Revisiting the Fed &apos;s Crisis 
BERKELEY - Reading through the just-released transcripts of the US Federal Reserve &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meetings in 2008 , I found myself asking the same overarching question : What accounted for the FOMC &apos;s blinkered mindset as crisis erupted all around it ? 
To be sure , some understood the true nature of the situation . 
As Jon Hilsenrath of the Wall Street Journal points out , William Dudley , then the executive vice president of the New York Fed &apos;s Markets Group , presented staff research that sought , politely and compellingly , to turn the principals &quot; attention to where it needed to be focused . 
And FOMC members Janet Yellen , Donald Kohn , Eric Rosengren , and Frederic Mishkin , along with the Board of Governors in Washington clearly got the message . 
But the FOMC &apos;s other eight members , and the rest of the senior staff ? 
Not so much ( albeit to greatly varying degrees ) . 
As I read the transcripts , I recalled the long history dating back to 1825 , and before , in which the uncontrolled failure of major banks triggered panic , a flight to quality , the collapse of asset prices , and depression . 
But there in the FOMC &apos;s mid-September 2008 report , many members express self-congratulation for having found the strength to take the incomprehensible decision not to bail out Lehman Brothers . 
I find myself thinking back to the winter of 2008 , when I stole - and used as much as possible - an observation by the economist Larry Summers . 
In the aftermath of the housing bubble &apos;s collapse and extraordinary losses in the derivatives market , Summers noted , banks would have to diminish leverage . 
While it would not matter much to any individual bank whether it did so by reducing its loan portfolio or by raising its capital , it mattered very much to the economy that the banks chose the second . 
Even today , I cannot comprehend then-New York Fed President Timothy Geithner &apos;s declaration in March 2008 that , &quot; it is very hard to make the judgment now that the financial system as a whole or the banking system as a whole is undercapitalized . &quot; 
Geithner &apos;s view at the time was that &quot; there is nothing more dangerous ... than for people ... to feed ... concerns about ... the basic core strength of the financial system . &quot; 
Of course , we now know that indifference to such concerns turned out to be far more dangerous . 
Likewise , I look at history and see that it is core inflation ( which strips out volatile food and energy prices ) , not headline inflation , that matters for predicting future inflation ( even future headline inflation ) . 
Then I read declarations like that by Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher , that dangerous inflationary pressure was building during the summer of 2008 , and I find myself at a loss . 
Some of the 2008-era mindset ( most of it ? ) most likely stemmed from the fact that there are things that are very real and solid to monetary economists . 
We can see , touch , and feel how a financial-deleveraging cycle depresses aggregate demand . 
We know that this year &apos;s change in an inertial price , such as wages , tells us a lot about next year &apos;s wage changes , while this year &apos;s change in a non-inertial price , such as oil , tells us next to nothing . 
And we know how herd behavior by investors means that a single salient bank failure can turn a financial mania into a panic , and then a crash . 
But others do not see , touch , and feel these things . 
For non-economists , they are simply shadows on the walls of a cave . 
That distinction was less relevant in the past . 
The Fed of old usually had a charismatic , autocratic , professional central banker at its head : Benjamin Strong , Marriner Eccles , William McChesney Martin , Paul Volcker , and Alan Greenspan . 
When it worked - which was not always true - the chair ruled the FOMC with an iron hand and with the near-lockstep voting support of the governors . 
The views of the other members - with their varying backgrounds in banking , regulation , and elsewhere - were of little or no concern . 
But former Chairman Ben Bernanke &apos;s FOMC was different . 
It was collegial , respectful , and consensus-oriented . 
As a result , there was a deep disconnect between Bernanke &apos;s policy views , which followed from his analyses in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s of the Great Depression and Japan &apos;s &quot; lost decades , &quot; and the FOMC &apos;s failure in 2008 to sense what was coming and to guard against the major downside risks . 
So I find myself wondering : What if those who understood the nature of the crisis and those who did not had been compelled to make their cases to Bernanke in private ? 
If Bernanke had then said , &quot; This is what we are going to do , &quot; rather than seeking consensus - that is , if Bernanke &apos;s Fed had been like the old Fed - would better monetary-policy decisions have been made in 2008 ?
