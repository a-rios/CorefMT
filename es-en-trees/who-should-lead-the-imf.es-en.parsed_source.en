Who Should Lead the IMF ? 
BERKELEY - The International Monetary Fund , many say , has had a good crisis . 
As recently as three years ago , many observers thought that the Fund had outlived its usefulness and should be closed down . 
Since then , it has intervened in Hungary , Latvia , Iceland , and Ukraine , among other crisis-stricken countries - and has received a massive infusion of new resources . 
Part of the explanation for the higher esteem in which the IMF is now held is its recent display of intellectual flexibility - a rare virtue for a big , lumbering bureaucracy . 
It has rethought its traditional opposition to capital controls . 
It has suggested that central banks may want to consider higher inflation targets in order to avoid hitting the zero bound in the event of deflationary shocks . 
The IMF has also put in place a Flexible Credit Line to disburse funds quickly - and free of onerous conditions - to countries buffeted by financial crosswinds through no fault of their own . 
The problem is that , despite its alluring name , the new facility has had few takers , and no Asian takers in particular . 
Indeed , it is revealing that when South Korea was desperate for dollars following the failure of Lehman Brothers , it borrowed from the United States Federal Reserve , not from the Fund . 
After their experience in 1997-1998 , Korean policymakers would sooner jump off a cliff than borrow , even without conditions , from the IMF . 
Nevertheless , while not all is sweetness and light , there has been progress . 
And for this the IMF &apos;s strong , politically astute management - not exactly something from which the Fund has regularly benefited in recent years - deserves credit . 
Now , however , the rumor mill is heating up with gossip that the Fund &apos;s managing director , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , will leave in order to oppose Nikolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential elections . 
Sarkozy &apos;s popularity is hitting new lows , and Strauss-Kahn &apos;s friends say that he has never made a secret of his political ambitions . 
A lame-duck managing director would hamstring the Fund . 
Already there is a sense that the IMF is reluctant to tell Europe more forcefully how to handle its problem with Greece because the managing director must be careful to avoid meddling in Europe &apos;s internal politics . 
On top of this now comes the interesting news that the IMF has appointed Zhu Min , previously a deputy governor of the People &apos;s Bank of China , as special adviser to Strauss-Kahn . 
Zhu will thus be part of the core management team . 
This , in turn , has fueled speculation that Zhu will be a candidate to become the next managing director . 
It is the turn of someone from outside Europe to head the IMF - Europe having had a monopoly on the position since the Fund was created following World War II . 
The bargain then was that the US could pick the president of the World Bank while the Europeans would get the top slot at the IMF ( US policymakers in their wisdom believing that the Bank would become the more important institution ) . 
But today &apos;s world is more multi-polar . 
It is no longer dominated by the Atlantic economies , so those economies should no longer dictate who holds the top jobs at the two Bretton Woods institutions . 
It is now , the argument goes , another region &apos;s turn . 
The obvious choice is Asia , home to the most dynamic emerging markets . 
It is the region to which the world &apos;s economic center of gravity is shifting . 
If you ask Asian leaders what would make them consider again approaching the Fund after their traumatic experience with IMF &quot; assistance &quot; in 1997-1998 , they will answer : an Asian managing director . 
In fact , this is precisely the wrong way to think about the problem . 
The IMF &apos;s problem in the past has been parochialism and lack of accountability . 
The best way to ensure that the Fund remains open to new ideas is by selecting the person with the best ideas to lead it . 
The best way to ensure that the IMF &apos;s management is accountable to all of its governmental shareholders is to prevent the top job from becoming the sinecure of any region , whether Europe or Asia . 
The next managing director should be selected on the merits , not on the basis of nationality . 
There should be an open competition , in which the best candidate wins on the basis of his or her ideas . 
Asia has plenty of competent economic officials who might be considered as the next managing director of the IMF . But just because they are Asian is not reason enough to select them .
