Poor Little Rich Country 
Feeling sympathy for Norway is hard . 
Thanks to its massive North Sea oil reserves , the country has achieved a level of wealth unimaginable only a generation ago - and which has allowed it to cold-shoulder the European Union since 1994 . 
But Norway &apos;s problems , while hardly on a par with Sub-Saharan Africa or Afghanistan , are nonetheless serious enough to elicit concern , if not pity . 
When a country &apos;s newly discovered natural resource abundance leads to windfall wealth , investment in the rest of its economy shifts away from the tradeables sector ( mainly manufactured exports ) and into the nontradeables sector ( mainly consumer goods and services ) . 
The diagnosis is a familiar one known as &quot; the Dutch disease . &quot; 
If and when the natural resource generating the windfall wealth ( in this case , oil and gas ) disappears , the economy is left with too few competitive industries and too many empty bookstore-cafes . 
Painful restructuring is sure to follow . 
So far , Norway has avoided the worst pitfalls of the Dutch disease by using its massive oil revenues to establish a national savings scheme , the Petroleum Fund , which is permitted to invest only in foreign assets . 
This rule serves to curb inflationary demand pressure while preventing elected officials from squandering the country &apos;s riches on politically rewarding but economically wasteful projects . 
On both counts , however , Norway has recently lowered its guard and is heading for trouble . 
Wages throughout the economy have soared , with the average increase likely to hit a whopping 6 % this year . 
To compensate , firms have been raising prices , fueling inflation . 
But with the central bank committed to holding annual inflation to an average of 2.5 % , Norway &apos;s interest rates are currently among the highest in Europe . 
This has helped cause the exchange rate to strengthen by nearly 10 % over the last year against the currencies of Norway &apos;s main trading partners , making the tradeables sector even less competitive . 
Domestic industries that face foreign competition are beginning to close down or relocate abroad . 
As a result , in one of the world &apos;s richest countries , unemployment is rising . 
But the real problem is the public sector . 
Government spending is now increasing by 4 % annually because of a new &quot; action rule , &quot; enacted in 2001 , that allows revenue from the Petroleum Fund to be phased into the domestic economy . 
But the additional budget revenue has merely offset lower taxes , while high wages and interest rates are jacking up public expenses . 
So more government spending is needed to maintain public services at the same level - and to keep unemployment down . 
The cycle thus takes another vicious turn : higher interest rates , continuing currency appreciation , further decimation of the tradeables sector , and the risk of more unemployment . 
If Norway is to avoid succumbing to the Dutch disease , there can be only one solution . 
With the importance of the tradeables sector dwindling away , the nontradeables sector must increase its productivity and output . 
There is only one main way that the necessary productivity and outcome gains can be achieved : excess demand in the public sector must be shifted elsewhere . 
After all , the demand will not disappear on its own . 
Waiting lists for medical and nursing services in Norway already seem endless , and school buildings are deteriorating - some have even been closed down by the public health authorities . 
A range of public services will therefore have to be privatized . 
As always , this will be a politically contentious and challenging process . 
But it will also provide a golden opportunity to realize the country &apos;s potential through a strategy of sensible investment - the original purpose of the Petroleum Fund . 
This strategy should include significant investments in human capital : education , training , and basic scientific research . 
But brilliant ideas cannot be made to order . 
Any government effort to sustain dying industries or to allocate investment by picking all sorts of &quot; innovative &quot; projects will be a recipe for economic disaster . 
As so often in the rest of the world , windfall wealth such as came to Norway because of its oil and gas , can be a curse as much as it is a blessing . 
With just 10-15 years of estimated oil reserves remaining , the United Arab Emirates last year dropped visa requirements for most Westerners in an effort to accelerate the development of a viable tourist trade . 
With the recent discovery of its huge Caspian Sea reserves , Kazakhstan stands at the start of this process . 
These countries , like Norway , were winners in the natural resource lottery .
