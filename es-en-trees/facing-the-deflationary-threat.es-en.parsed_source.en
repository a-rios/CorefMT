Facing the Deflationary Threat 
Many central bankers are like the proverbial general who plans to fight the last war . 
But unlike backward-looking military strategy , flawed monetary policies produce inevitable damage , not merely worrisome risks . 
Despite having conquered inflation , central bankers continue to fight it and as a result may fail to confront the latest economic menace - global deflation . 
Falling prices have paralyzed Japan &apos;s economy for a decade . 
China and Hong Kong have seen prices plummet recently too . 
As the world &apos;s richest nations gather in Canada for the annual G-7 jamboree , their leaders should ask if the US and Europe face a similar fate . 
Deflation should not be hard to check , with sound policy . 
Some argue that rapid productivity gains from new technology , increased competition due to globalization , and the rise of internet-based electronic commerce created a world in which firms must steadily lower prices . 
But this thinking is based on a fallacy . 
Clearly , economic forces other than a country &apos;s monetary policy determine the relative prices that different goods and services should have - and which they eventually do have , regardless of monetary policy . 
These forces do not determine the absolute price ( in dollars , say ) of any good . 
The absolute price of any good is determined by monetary policy , in a way largely independent of the structure of relative prices . 
The only exception is when monetary policy is conducted in a manner that focuses on the prices of particular goods rather than on stabilization of a broad price index . 
For example , the US experienced chronic deflation at the 19 th century &apos;s end . 
This was due to developments - such as the growing number of nations on the gold standard - that required the market price of gold to increase relative to prices of goods and services generally . 
Demand for gold increased , while supply was relatively constant . 
Relative price changes could have occurred in two ways : either the dollar price of gold could have increased or the dollar prices of all other goods and services could decrease . 
America &apos;s commitment to a rapid return to the gold standard prevented an increase in the dollar price of gold , so deflation ensued . 
Much the same thing happens today . 
Hong Kong &apos;s declining attractiveness as a business center helped push down prices of locally produced goods and services relative to the prices of goods sold overseas . 
Again , relative prices could change either through an increase in the HK dollar price of internationally traded goods or through decreases in the HK dollar prices of local goods . 
Since Hong Kong &apos;s currency board prevents inflation in HK dollar prices , the HK dollar prices of local goods must fall . 
This would be unnecessary if Hong Kong adopted a monetary policy aimed at stabilizing a broad price index like the kind of policy pursued in the US , the euro zone , and most of the world . 
But can central banks stabilize a falling price index as effectively as a rising one ? 
Some economists argue that once deflation sets in , central banks are powerless because nominal interest rates cannot be pushed below zero . 
In a deflationary environment , this means that real interest rates - that are all that matter for economic stimulus - can not be pushed as low as might be necessary to boost demand and stem downward pressure on prices . 
The Bank of Japan &apos;s overnight interest rate has been essentially zero since 1999 , but prices still fall . 
Yet even in Japan , monetary policy could stimulate spending . 
Effective central banking is mostly a matter of managing expectations ; for it is expectations regarding future policy , rather than the current level of overnight rates , that mainly determines long-term rates , other asset prices , and the exchange rate - and hence spending and pricing decisions . 
When current overnight rates can no longer be lowered , it is vital that a central bank credibly signal its intention to maintain looser policy in the future , when it will have more room to maneuver . 
For years the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) failed to provide signals of this kind . 
It was more concerned with posing as an inflation-fighter . 
This misbegotten strategy culminated in the Bank &apos;s decision in August 2000 to abandon the zero interest-rate policy at the first signs of economic recovery , effectively declaring that it would not use monetary policy to bring about negative real rates after expectations of inflation returned . 
The BOJ changed course a year ago when it committed to maintaining low interest rates until deflation ends . 
This was a timid but helpful initial step in the right direction . 
But an explicit price-level target would help more . 
Such a commitment would create definite inflation expectations ( albeit not of continuing inflation ) . 
More importantly , to the extent that deflation continues , it would also automatically create greater expectations of inflation - and thus greater stimulus . 
In the US , the Federal Reserve has paid much more attention to managing expectations , resulting in an effective monetary policy . 
Indeed , financial markets end up doing much of the Fed &apos;s work for it . 
With clear and predictable communication of this sort , the risk that the Fed would be unable to free the US economy from a deflationary slump is much lower - and so is the risk that it would ever have to fight that battle . 
Other G-7 leaders might profit by seeking to apply this lesson more broadly .
