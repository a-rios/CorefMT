Abe &apos;s Long March 
TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo &apos;s coalition government has decided to &quot; reinterpret &quot; the postwar Japanese constitution . 
According to Article 9 of the constitution , drafted by American lawyers in 1946 , when Japan was under Allied occupation , Japan renounces &quot; war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes . &quot; 
The new interpretation would allow Japan to use military force in support of an ally if Japanese security is under threat . 
Abe chose to reinterpret the constitution because revising it would require the approval of two-thirds of the Japanese Diet . 
Given that most Japanese are still allergic to military force , securing the necessary votes would have been impossible . 
The reinterpretation will almost certainly result in protests from China and South Korea against resurgent Japanese militarism . 
Because Abe is the nationalist grandson of a former prime minister who was once arrested as a war criminal , and because he has paid public tribute to soldiers who died for the emperor in World War II , these protests might seem reasonable . 
Abe &apos;s break with Japan &apos;s pacifist consensus is beyond doubt . 
But the circumstances under which Japan would use force are so restricted that a revival of militarism is still a very long way off . 
More worrying is the effect on Japanese democracy : Elected governments do not simply change the meaning of the constitution without even bothering to get parliamentary support . 
There is , however , an odd contradiction in Abe &apos;s nationalism . 
Constitutional pacifism was part of the postwar order imposed by the United States during occupation and largely supported by the Japanese people , who were tired of war . 
Unlike in Germany , Japan had no Hitler or Nazi party on which to blame their wartime atrocities . 
What needed to be purged instead , postwar reformers believed , was a specific form of Japanese militarism , rooted in emperor worship , the samurai tradition , authoritarian &quot; feudalism , &quot; and so on . 
Much in the remaking of Japan after 1945 is still to be admired : democracy , women &apos;s suffrage , land reform , freedom of speech . 
But taking away Japan &apos;s sovereign right to use military force had one major consequence : Japanese security was put almost entirely into American hands , reducing Japan to the status of a vassal state . 
That is why the main goal of nationalist-minded Japanese leaders , starting with Abe &apos;s grandfather , Nobusuke Kishi , has been the return of full Japanese sovereignty by revising Article 9 . 
That was not possible when Kishi was prime minister in the late 1950s . 
The Japanese were not ready for it and Kishi was tainted by his wartime record as Minister of Munitions . 
Abe &apos;s dream is to make it happen now - and to go further . 
He would like to restore some aspects of an older Japan , discredited by Japanese military behavior , such as patriotic pride , a more central role for the imperial institution , and even a reappraisal of Japan &apos;s wartime record itself . 
Hence his tributes to the Yasukuni Shrine , where the souls of imperial soldiers , including notorious war criminals , are worshipped . 
Many Asians , including some Japanese , see this as a sign of new militarism . 
Abe would like it to be viewed as an attempt to restore Japan &apos;s international reputation as a &quot; normal country . &quot; 
But Abe &apos;s idea of normality is not yet shared by the majority of Japanese , let alone other Asians . 
The contradiction in Abe &apos;s nationalism is this : even as he talks about sovereignty regained and patriotic pride , he has done nothing to distance Japan from the postwar dominance of the US . 
On the contrary , his reinterpretation of the constitution is meant to help the US in its military policing of East Asia . 
In fact , what appears to be driving Abe &apos;s endeavors even more than the desire to revise the postwar order in Japan is a widely shared fear of China &apos;s increasing regional dominance . 
A cursory glance at the Japanese press , or even the kind of books piled high in Japanese bookstores , shows just how frightened the Japanese are . 
All of the talk in Tokyo is about Chinese aggression in the East and South China Seas . 
Abe &apos;s reinterpretation , then , is not really a radical departure from the postwar order at all . 
China &apos;s growing power has actually reinforced Japanese dependence on the US for its security . 
Japan &apos;s main worry is that the US may not wish to risk a war with China over territorial disputes in the East China Sea . 
What is feared most , in addition to the rise of China , is the possible decline of the US . 
The Japan-US alliance is an irritation to the Chinese , who would like the US to get out of the way , in order to be Asia &apos;s dominant player . 
Or so they say in public . 
In fact , Chinese attitudes may be more complicated and less unified than they seem . 
Indeed , China faces a rather stark choice . 
Privately , many Chinese might still prefer the former . 
This may seem to be the most stable solution . 
To be sure , the US military presence still imposes a certain order with which most parties can live ; but it risks dragging the world &apos;s largest military power into petty regional conflicts , a prospect that should alarm us one century after 1914 .
