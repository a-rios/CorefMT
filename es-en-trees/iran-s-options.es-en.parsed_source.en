Iran &apos;s Options 
Berlin  -  
With President Bush in Europe getting EU leaders to agree to toughen UN sanctions against Iran , and with the ongoing debate between John McCain and Barack Obama about whether the US needs to talk with Iran &apos;s rulers , the issue of Iran &apos;s nuclear program is heating up . Iranians , no surprise , are watching this debate with interest . They need to do more than watch . 
Iran &apos;s political elite sees the United States , rather than Europe , as their appropriate international counterpart . 
Only the US can give the Islamic Republic the security guarantees it craves . 
The US , indeed , should be prepared to eventually give such guarantees if it wants Iran to stop the more suspicious parts of its nuclear program . 
But Iran must do its part to make any future dialogue with the US a success . 
In talks with members of Iran &apos;s policy community , I am continually astounded that they see resolving the nuclear conflict ( or , indeed , other problems in which Iran has a stake ) to be primarily the responsibility of the US , Europe , and other major powers , not of Iran . 
Such passivity is not in Iran &apos;s interest . As the Middle East &apos;s essential regional player , Iran can trigger and heat up conflicts as well as contribute to their solution . 
Yet few in the Iranian establishment understand that being the leading regional power brings responsibility ; and that only responsible behavior can create legitimacy and acceptance that Iran craves . 
Iranian policymakers must , therefore , try to develop their own ideas for a negotiated resolution of the nuclear and other regional security issues , as well as to think about how Iran can rebuild trust in its actions . 
Iran &apos;s leaders should begin by shunning hostile rhetoric . 
Incendiary statements about Israel exacerbate the lack of trust among Iran &apos;s would-be partners , and make it hard for those in Europe and the US who are interested in building more favorable relations . 
Iran hints that it wants to have a high-level dialogue with the US in the not-too-distant future . 
If true , Iran should realize that violent statements on sensitive issues will set back any serious attempt to get a dialogue going . 
Iran could also build trust if it became more transparent , particularly about its own strategic ambitions . 
A good start would be to publish key documents that are constantly referred to by Iranians but never seen - say , Ayatollah Khamenei &apos;s fatwa that reportedly rules that Islam prohibits the production , stockpiling , and use of nuclear weapons ? 
It would also be helpful if Iran laid out its strategic vision for the region . 
It should accept the concerns of its neighbors , seek to develop its own ideas for regional confidence- and security building , and participate in efforts to create regional security arrangements . 
It should also positively respond to offers from the US to establish confidence-building measures between the two countries &quot; military forces , particularly their navies . 
As to the nuclear issue , Iran should try to switch from the language of &quot; inalienable rights &quot; to one of pragmatic solutions . 
This would help depoliticize the issue . 
The right to independent nuclear research and development under the NPT is not disputed . 
But rather than insist as a matter of principle on operating the fuel cycle independently under national sovereignty , Iran could engage the Saudis about their idea of a regional joint venture , or explore different options of multilateral consortia with other countries . 
Iran &apos;s parliament , now led by Ali Larijani , Iran &apos;s former nuclear negotiator , could make a strong contribution to confidence building and to the resolution of the nuclear conflict by ratifying the NPT &apos;s Additional Protocol . 
Other clarifications are also needed . Is Iran prepared to accept a compromise that responds to European and other international concerns about its nuclear program , and thereby gain wide-ranging economic , energy , technology and science cooperation ? 
Nuclear energy , after all , is only one technology , and a 20th century , rather than a 21st century one at that . 
Eventually , partnership with Europe could help Iran keep the best of its young generation at home rather than having them queue for visas at foreign embassies - or , more often , the US consulates in Istanbul or Dubai . 
The willingness of major countries to accept Iran with a nuclear status similar to Japan depends on whether Iran not only refers to itself as a status-quo power - which it occasionally does - but whether it acts as such . 
If it wants to be seen as a status-quo power , it needs to accept local and international efforts at establishing peace between Israel and its neighbors . 
For a grand bargain with the US , Iran needs to end its support for militant organizations like Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad which undermine efforts at reaching a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine . 
Even without such a bargain , however , Iran will have to do certain things if it wants to be seen as a constructive regional player . 
It will have to accept all the other states in the region as legitimate players with their own legitimate interests as much as it wants to be recognized as such itself . 
It will also have to accept the wish of the huge majority of Palestinians for a peaceful settlement with Israel . 
Iranian officials sometimes try to make relative President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s more violent statements about Israel as nothing more than a call for &quot; regime change . &quot; 
That is not a status-quo policy . 
Iran is entitled to seek assurances against externally forced regime change . 
But it cannot have it both ways , seeking guarantees against regime change at home , and promoting it in its neighborhood .
