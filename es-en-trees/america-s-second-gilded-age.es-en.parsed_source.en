America \ u0027s Second Gilded Age 
The richest Congressional district in the US is the so-called &quot; silk-stocking &quot; district of New York City &apos;s Upper East Side , with a per-capita income of $ 41,151 per year . 
The poorest Congressional district is a largely Hispanic-immigrant district in Los Angeles , with a per-capita income of $ 6,997 a year . 
In 1973 the poorest fifth of America &apos;s families had incomes that averaged $ 13,240 a year ( in today &apos;s dollars ) ; in 2000 the average incomes of the poorest fifth were the same : $ 13,320 . 
By contrast , the richest 5 % of America &apos;s families in 1973 had an average income of $ 149,150 , and in 2000 the richest 5 % had an average income of $ 254,840 . 
The increase in inequality was large enough to give a 2 / 3 income boost to the well-off over a time when incomes in the middle grew by only 10 % and incomes at the bottom not at all . 
To outsiders , the most peculiar thing about America &apos;s rising inequality is that so few Americans object . 
Surely a society with a skewed income distribution is worse off than one in which incomes are more equal . 
An extra $ 10,000 a year does little to raise the well-being of a multi-millionaire , while a deficiency of $ 10,000 a year makes a huge impact on how a middle-class family lives . 
If you follow Nobel Prize-winner James Buchanan &apos;s utilitarian principle that you should evaluate a society &apos;s social welfare by imagining that you have an equal chance of being poor and rich , it is easy to judge that the more equal society has a better set of social and economic arrangements . 
From there it is easy to make the leap to the position that - so long as redistributive taxes don &apos;t slow economic growth - when inequality rises , it is the government &apos;s duty to tax the rich and transfer money to the poor to offset the rise . 
Yet there are no calls in mainstream politics to sharply increase the progressiveness of the income tax . 
Indeed , even at the left end of mainstream discourse , the boldest call is for the well-off merely to contribute their &quot; fair share &quot; to paying for the costs of government . 
One candidate for the Senate in the recent US elections , Erskine Bowles of North Carolina ( a former chief of staff to President Clinton ) was judged bold and foolhardy not for proposing redistributive tax increases , but simply for placing a higher priority on the federal government paying for prescription medicines than on a further cut in the highest marginal tax rate . 
What happened ? 
Bowles lost . 
Virtually no mainstream American politician seems opposed to eliminating the estate tax - a policy move that will further concentrate wealth for no countervailing supply-side gain . 
As Clinton &apos;s Assistant to the President for Economic Policy Gene Sperling once wrote , staff aides who tell Congressmen that estate tax repeal ... &quot; costing tens of billions of dollars ... will benefit only a few thousand families &quot; are answered &quot; maybe so , but I think I met every one of them at my last fundraiser . &quot; 
It &apos;s not the case that the striking increase in income inequality was necessary to deliver rapid economic growth . 
Most of the increase took place , after all , between 1973 and 1995 - a period during which American economic growth was slower than in any other period since the Great Depression . 
It &apos;s not the case that income gains in the middle have been large enough to make mainstream voters feel generous about what is happening among their merchant princes : save for the past half-decade , income gains away from the top have been so meager that it &apos;s hard to argue that people are living much better than their parents did . 
So why don &apos;t Americans feel more alarm at their country &apos;s rising income inequality ? 
Part of the reason that they don &apos;t is that most Americans do not recognize what is going on . 
One poll found that 19 % of Americans think their incomes put them in the top 1 % of income distribution - and that 20 % more hope to reach the top 1 % someday . 
Deep in the core of American ideology and culture is a constellation of beliefs and attitudes : belief that the future will be brighter than the present ; that what you accomplish you make with your own hands ; that individuals should rely on themselves , not the state ; that people can cross oceans and mountains to make for themselves a better life ; and that those who succeed do so not through luck and corruption but through preparation and industry . 
These are not beliefs conducive to social democracy . 
For two generations starting in 1933 America did look a lot like a west European-style social democracy . 
The shock of the Great Depression and the response of Roosevelt &apos;s New Deal probably accounts for the shockingly &quot; un-American &quot; attitude toward redistribution of that era . 
But somebody ten years old when Franklin Roosevelt was elected is now eighty . 
Memories of the Great Depression are dying out . 
So what now seems likely is that the older and more enduring - call it the Gilded Age - pattern of American ideology , culture , and political economy is reasserting itself . 
Inequality , it seems , is as American as apple pie .
