The World Economy &apos;s Shifting Challenges 
NEW YORK - As 2013 comes to a close , efforts to revive growth in the world &apos;s most influential economies - with the exception of the eurozone - are having a beneficial effect worldwide . 
All of the looming problems for the global economy are political in character . 
After 25 years of stagnation , Japan is attempting to reinvigorate its economy by engaging in quantitative easing on an unprecedented scale . 
It is a risky experiment : faster growth could drive up interest rates , making debt-servicing costs unsustainable . 
And , judging from the public &apos;s enthusiastic support , so would ordinary Japanese . 
By contrast , the European Union is heading toward the type of long-lasting stagnation from which Japan is desperate to escape . The stakes are high : Nation-states can survive a lost decade or more ; but the EU , an incomplete association of nation-states , could easily be destroyed by it . 
The euro &apos;s design - which was modeled on the Deutsche Mark - has a fatal flaw . 
Creating a common central bank without a common treasury means that government debts are denominated in a currency that no single member country controls , making them subject to the risk of default . 
As a consequence of the crash of 2008 , several member countries became over indebted , and risk premia made the eurozone &apos;s division into creditor and debtor countries permanent . 
This defect could have been corrected by replacing individual countries &quot; bonds with Eurobonds . 
Unfortunately , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , reflecting the radical change that Germans &quot; attitudes toward European integration have undergone , ruled that out . 
Prior to reunification , Germany was the main motor of integration ; now , weighed down by reunification &apos;s costs , German taxpayers are determined to avoid becoming European debtors &quot; deep pocket . 
After the crash of 2008 , Merkel insisted that each country should look after its own financial institutions and government debts should be paid in full . 
Without realizing it , Germany is repeating the tragic error of the French after World War I. Prime Minister Aristide Briand &apos;s insistence on reparations led to the rise of Hitler ; 
Angela Merkel &apos;s policies are giving rise to extremist movements in the rest of Europe . 
The current arrangements governing the euro are here to stay , because Germany will always do the bare minimum to preserve the common currency - and because the markets and the European authorities would punish any other country that challenged these arrangements . 
Nonetheless , the acute phase of the financial crisis is now over . 
The European financial authorities have tacitly recognized that austerity is counterproductive and have stopped imposing additional fiscal constraints . 
This has given the debtor countries some breathing room , and , even in the absence of any growth prospects , financial markets have stabilized . 
Future crises will be political in origin . 
Indeed , this is already apparent , because the EU has become so inward-looking that it cannot adequately respond to external threats , be they in Syria or Ukraine . 
As a result , the crisis has transformed the EU from the &quot; fantastic object &quot; that inspired enthusiasm into something radically different . 
What was meant to be a voluntary association of equal states that sacrificed part of their sovereignty for the common good - the embodiment of the principles of an open society - has now been transformed by the euro crisis into a relationship between creditor and debtor countries that is neither voluntary nor equal . 
Indeed , the euro could destroy the EU altogether . 
In contrast to Europe , the United States is emerging as the developed world &apos;s strongest economy . 
Shale energy has given the US an important competitive advantage in manufacturing in general and in petrochemicals in particular . 
The banking and household sectors have made some progress in deleveraging . 
Quantitative easing has boosted asset values . 
The fiscal drag exerted by sequestration is also about to expire . 
More surprising , the polarization of American politics shows signs of reversing . 
The two-party system worked reasonably well for two centuries , because both parties had to compete for the middle ground in general elections . 
Then the Republican Party was captured by a coalition of religious and market fundamentalists , later reinforced by neo-conservatives , that moved it to a far-right extreme . 
The Democrats tried to catch up in order to capture the middle ground , and both parties colluded in gerrymandering Congressional districts . 
As a consequence , activist-dominated party primaries took precedence over general elections . 
That completed the polarization of American politics . 
Eventually , the Republican Party &apos;s Tea Party wing overplayed its hand . 
After the recent debacle of the government shutdown , what remains of the Republican establishment has begun fighting back , and this should lead to a revival of the two-party system . 
The major uncertainty facing the world today is not the euro but the future direction of China . 
The growth model responsible for its rapid rise has run out of steam . 
That model depended on financial repression of the household sector , in order to drive the growth of exports and investments . 
As a result , the household sector has now shrunk to 35 % of GDP , and its forced savings are no longer sufficient to finance the current growth model . 
There are some eerie resemblances with the financial conditions that prevailed in the US in the years preceding the crash of 2008 . 
But there is a significant difference , too . 
Aware of the dangers , the People &apos;s Bank of China took steps starting in 2012 to curb the growth of debt ; but when the slowdown started to cause real distress in the economy , the Party asserted its supremacy . 
In July 2013 , the leadership ordered the steel industry to restart the furnaces and the PBOC to ease credit . 
The economy turned around on a dime . 
In November , the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee announced far-reaching reforms . 
These developments are largely responsible for the recent improvement in the global outlook . 
The Chinese leadership was right to give precedence to economic growth over structural reforms , because structural reforms , when combined with fiscal austerity , push economies into a deflationary tailspin . 
How and when this contradiction will be resolved will have profound consequences for China and the world . 
A successful transition in China will most likely entail political as well as economic reforms , while failure would undermine still-widespread trust in the country &apos;s political leadership , resulting in repression at home and military confrontation abroad . 
The other great unresolved problem is the absence of proper global governance . 
The lack of agreement among the United Nations Security Council &apos;s five permanent members is exacerbating humanitarian catastrophes in countries like Syria - not to mention allowing global warming to proceed largely unhindered .
