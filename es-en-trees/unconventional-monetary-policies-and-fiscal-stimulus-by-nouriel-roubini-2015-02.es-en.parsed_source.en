An Unconventional Truth 
NEW YORK - Who would have thought that six years after the global financial crisis , most advanced economies would still be swimming in an alphabet soup - ZIRP , QE , CE , FG , NDR , and U-FX Int - of unconventional monetary policies ? 
No central bank had considered any of these measures ( zero interest rate policy , quantitative easing , credit easing , forward guidance , negative deposit rate , and unlimited foreign exchange intervention , respectively ) before 2008 . 
Today , they have become a staple of policymakers &quot; toolkits . 
Indeed , just in the last year and a half , the European Central Bank adopted its own version of FG , then moved to ZIRP , and then embraced CE , before deciding to try NDR . 
In January , it fully adopted QE . 
Indeed , by now the Fed , the Bank of England , the Bank of Japan , the ECB , and a variety of smaller advanced economies &quot; central banks , such as the Swiss National Bank , have all relied on such unconventional policies . 
One result of this global monetary-policy activism has been a rebellion among pseudo-economists and market hacks in recent years . 
This assortment of &quot; Austrian &quot; economists , radical monetarists , gold bugs , and Bitcoin fanatics has repeatedly warned that such a massive increase in global liquidity would lead to hyperinflation , the US dollar &apos;s collapse , sky-high gold prices , and the eventual demise of fiat currencies at the hands of digital krypto-currency counterparts . 
None of these dire predictions has been borne out by events . 
Inflation is low and falling in almost all advanced economies ; indeed , all advanced-economy central banks are failing to achieve their mandate - explicit or implicit - of 2 % inflation , and some are struggling to avoid deflation . 
Moreover , the value of the dollar has been soaring against the yen , euro , and most emerging-market currencies . 
Gold prices since the fall of 2013 have tumbled from $ 1,900 per ounce to around $ 1,200 . 
To be sure , most of the doomsayers have barely any knowledge of basic economics . 
So it is worth asking why their predictions have been so spectacularly wrong . 
The root of their error lies in their confusion of cause and effect . 
The reason why central banks have increasingly embraced unconventional monetary policies is that the post-2008 recovery has been extremely anemic . 
Such policies have been needed to counter the deflationary pressures caused by the need for painful deleveraging in the wake of large buildups of public and private debt . 
In most advanced economies , for example , there is still a very large output gap , with output and demand well below potential ; thus , firms have limited pricing power . 
There is considerable slack in labor markets as well : Too many unemployed workers are chasing too few available jobs , while trade and globalization , together with labor-saving technological innovations , are increasingly squeezing workers &quot; jobs and incomes , placing a further drag on demand . 
Moreover , there is still slack in real-estate markets where booms went bust ( the United States , the United Kingdom , Spain , Ireland , Iceland , and Dubai ) . 
Commodity markets , too , have become a source of disinflationary pressure . 
North America &apos;s shale-energy revolution has weakened oil and gas prices , while China &apos;s slowdown has undermined demand for a broad range of commodities , including iron ore , copper , and other industrial metals , all of which are in greater supply after years of high prices stimulated investments in new capacity . 
China &apos;s slowdown , coming after years of over-investment in real estate and infrastructure , is also causing a global glut of manufactured and industrial goods . 
With domestic demand in these sectors now contracting sharply , the excess capacity in China &apos;s steel and cement sectors - to cite just two examples - is fueling further deflationary pressure in global industrial markets . 
Rising income inequality , by redistributing income from those who spend more to those who save more , has exacerbated the demand shortfall . 
So has the asymmetric adjustment between over-saving creditor economies that face no market pressure to spend more , and over-spending debtor economies that do face market pressure and have been forced to save more . 
Simply put , we live in a world in which there is too much supply and too little demand . 
The result is persistent disinflationary , if not deflationary , pressure , despite aggressive monetary easing . 
The inability of unconventional monetary policies to prevent outright deflation partly reflects the fact that such policies seek to weaken the currency , thereby improving net exports and increasing inflation . 
This , however , is a zero-sum game that merely exports deflation and recession to other economies . 
Perhaps more important has been a profound mismatch with fiscal policy . 
To be effective , monetary stimulus needs to be accompanied by temporary fiscal stimulus , which is now lacking in all major economies . 
Indeed , the eurozone , the UK , the US , and Japan are all pursuing varying degrees of fiscal austerity and consolidation . 
Even the International Monetary Fund has correctly pointed out that part of the solution for a world with too much supply and too little demand needs to be public investment in infrastructure , which is lacking - or crumbling - in most advanced economies and emerging markets ( with the exception of China ) . 
With long-term interest rates close to zero in most advanced economies ( and in some cases even negative ) , the case for infrastructure spending is indeed compelling . 
All of this adds up to a recipe for continued slow growth , secular stagnation , disinflation , and even deflation . 
That is why , in the absence of appropriate fiscal policies to address insufficient aggregate demand , unconventional monetary policies will remain a central feature of the macroeconomic landscape .
