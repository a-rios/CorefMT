The $ 4.3 Billion Shrug 
LONDON - In November , the United Kingdom &apos;s Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) announced a settlement in which six banks would be fined a total of $ 4.3 billion for manipulating the foreign-exchange market . 
Why ? 
The nefarious practices and management failings uncovered during the yearlong investigation that led to the fines were shocking . 
Semi-literate email and chat-room exchanges among venal traders revealed brazen conspiracies to rig the afternoon exchange-rate &quot; fix &quot; for profit and personal gain . 
Senior managers were so disengaged that they allowed their employees to act like vulgar , overpaid children . 
Using nicknames like &quot; the three musketeers &quot; and &quot; the A-team , &quot; they did whatever they liked , at an enormous cost to their institutions . 
But , despite the huge FCA fine , no top executive was forced to fall on his or her sword , and investors did little more than shrug . 
One reason , of course , is that the settlement was known to be coming ; only the details of the offenses and the scale of the fines were news . 
The more important reason , though , is that even $ 4.3 billion is small change when compared to the total fines and litigation costs incurred by the major banks over the last five years . 
Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the top 22 banks in the United States and Europe have been forced to pay $ 230 billion since 2009 - more than 50 times the cost of the FCA settlement . 
This is over and above the heavy losses that banks incurred from bad lending and overambitious financial engineering . 
American banks have incurred more than half of these massive penalties . 
The European bill amounts to just over $ 100 billion - roughly half of which was paid by the top seven British banks . 
But the numbers tell only part of the story . 
In the US , the penalties have been dominated by fines for sales of misleadingly marketed mortgage-backed securities , often to the two government supported entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
The banks , it would be fair to say , do not wholly accept regulators &quot; arguments about that , but they have bitten their tongues and paid up . 
( US regulators have also imposed high penalties on foreign banks for breaches of American sanctions policies in relation to Iran . ) 
In the UK , by contrast , the biggest penalties have come in the form of compensation payments made to individual mortgage borrowers who were sold Payment Protection Insurance . 
The regulators maintain that much of this insurance was worthless to borrowers and was mis-sold . 
The banks believe that some of the claimants whom they are being forced to pay are unworthy , but they have nonetheless coughed up the money . 
That unhappy episode has cost British banks $ 37 billion so far , with more to come - most likely another $ 5 billion or so . 
The Morgan Stanley analysis suggests that we can expect another $ 70 billion in fines and litigation costs over the next two years from already identified errors and omissions . 
And new episodes could emerge ; two years ago , no one anticipated the fallout from the manipulation of the foreign-exchange markets . 
The irony here - not lost on the major banks &quot; finance directors - is that as fast as banks add capital from rights issues and retained earnings to meet the demands of prudential regulators , the funds are drained away by conduct regulators . 
The scale of the penalties is now large enough to have a substantial impact on banks &quot; balance sheets , delay the restoration of their health , and constrain their lending capacity . 
Some of the money , especially in the UK , has gone back to individual customers . 
In the UK , fines once helped defray the regulator &apos;s costs : bad actors reduced the fees charged to the good ones , creating a positive feedback loop . 
Today , the payments have become so large that the government has seized them and channeled revenues exceeding the regulator &apos;s enforcement costs to veterans &quot; charities . 
In the US , the end recipients are less clear ; indeed , they are undisclosed . 
Charles Calomiris of Columbia University has challenged what he calls &quot; a real subversion of the fiscal process &quot; as funds are raised and spent in non-transparent ways . 
The most important question , however , is whether fines on this scale serve as useful deterrents . 
Clearly , the post-crisis period has revealed unacceptable behavior in many institutions . 
It will be some time before we know whether large fines on corporations , paid principally by their shareholders , contribute to keeping the system honest . 
But that seems unlikely when banks and investors seem punch-drunk , barely reacting to regulators &quot; blows . 
The FCA has just announced a review of its pricing policies . 
&quot; This is not a penalties race , &quot; according to Georgina Philippou , the authority &apos;s enforcement strategy director . 
Whether the current approach serves as an effective deterrent is a question that should be widely debated . 
Senior bank managers and regulators have a common interest in developing a more effective system - one that punishes the guilty and creates the right incentives for the future .
