The Cooperation Crisis 
PARIS - The rise of emerging economies worldwide has generated much optimism , in terms not only of economic development , but also of global cooperation . 
But the shift to a multipolar world order has not bolstered multilateralism . 
In fact , the opposite is true : the logic of national sovereignty has staged a comeback , with major economies consistently undermining cooperation on issues ranging from security to trade to climate change . 
Consider the muddle in the United Nations Security Council over Syria &apos;s civil war . 
Just two years ago , the Council approved a resolution authorizing a military intervention in Libya - the first resolution to implement the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; ( R2P ) principle , which the general assembly adopted unanimously in 2005 . 
But the emerging powers soon came to believe that the West had used the protection of Libya &apos;s civilian population as a pretext for regime change ( though , realistically , it would have been impossible to protect the population without toppling Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s government ) . 
Now , these countries are largely rejecting R2P , viewing it as a device employed by Western governments to legitimize their attempts to infringe upon national sovereignty . 
Brazil has attempted to address the issue by crafting a resolution that would decouple the R2P mandate from the use of force - effectively eliminating the possibility that the doctrine could be applied . 
For their part , Russia and China have blocked three resolutions condemning the Syrian regime , and Russia has worked hard - with evident success - to derail any military intervention in Syria . 
In this sense , Russia and China now exercise de facto control over the formal international legality of the use of force . 
To be sure , many countries Â­ now believe that the West is going too far in challenging state sovereignty , with even European countries like Germany recoiling at the prospect of military confrontation . 
At the G-20 summit in early September , for example , US President Barack Obama struggled to convince ten states to sign a declaration on Syria that did not even mention the use of force . 
Only the US , the United Kingdom , and France remain willing to use force if it is deemed necessary . 
But viewing intervention in Syria within the paradigm of Western messianism is a mistake . 
After all , in Syria , as in Libya , the forces challenging the government are not a creature of Western manipulation . 
They are indigenous - and they are asking the West for help . 
The legal basis for military intervention may be weak , but Syria is no Iraq , either . 
Security is not the only area where sovereignty concerns have superseded multilateralism . 
In 2008 , the US abandoned its commitment to the World Trade Organization &apos;s Doha Round of global trade negotiations . 
While the decision followed a technical disagreement with India , it was driven largely by the belief that any agreement would benefit China more than the US . 
Given that the Doha Round has failed to address the main problems that the US and Europe have encountered in trade relations with China - non-compliance with intellectual-property rules , subsidies for state-owned enterprises , closed government-procurement markets , and limits on access to the services market - both are now emphasizing bilateral trade agreements . 
But , while the world may be happy to pretend that bilateral cooperation will revitalize multilateralism , nobody should be fooled . 
The WTO will survive , but its centrality in the trade system is rapidly diminishing . 
Even cooperation on climate change is crumbling , with the US and China rejecting the multilateral , top-down approach to policymaking . 
This implies the end of the Kyoto Protocol model , which , like the Doha model , is based on a detailed agenda , established according to specific and ambitious targets , with all relevant actors then compelled to negotiate each topic . 
Rather than being subject to an internationally agreed standard , the US and China want the fight against climate change to begin with countries &quot; individual commitments . 
But this new , bottom-up framework , in which states determine the conditions for a multilateral agreement , lacks an authority to establish standards . 
Multilateralism requires minimal consensus on global rules and norms among all major powers . 
The greater the number of countries that have the power to block or veto international initiatives , the more difficult multilateralism becomes - and the less motivated dominant countries are to cooperate . 
In the emerging multipolar world , characterized by sovereignty concerns and strategic competition , progress toward resolving global issues will be more difficult than ever - with potentially devastating consequences .
