Tony Blair &apos;s Poisoned Legacy 
Tony Blair has a powerful claim to being one of the most successful British politicians of any recent generation , at least in domestic economic and social policy . 
But history will remember him mainly for his strategic error in going to war in Iraq . 
During his ten years in power , Blair and his Chancellor of the Exchequer , Gordon Brown , gave Britain one of the longest periods of economic stability , relatively high growth , and low unemployment that it had ever known . 
In this respect , Blair &apos;s premiership marked a fundamental break with the Labor Party &apos;s tax-and-spend tradition . 
It also established a new tradition of stability in economic policy , continuing and reinforcing the previous Conservative government &apos;s commitment to fiscal discipline and low inflation . 
Stable economic policy and rapid growth , in turn , enabled Blair &apos;s government to pour extra money into education and the National Health Service . 
Yet Blair &apos;s domestic legacy is a mood of disillusion and mistrust , especially of Blair himself . 
One reason is that a significant portion of Blair &apos;s party ( which he renamed &quot; New Labor &quot; ) never reconciled itself to the primacy that he gave to free-market principles over its old Socialist or Social Democratic values . 
Another is that Blair consistently seemed to pay much less attention to Parliament than to the right-wing tabloid press : the spin and media manipulation to which his office devoted so much effort worked wonders at first , but soon generated deep skepticism and mistrust . 
But the main reason for Britain &apos;s popular disillusion with Blair comes down to his role in the Iraq war , which was launched with the ostensible aim of pre-empting Iraq &apos;s use weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) . 
Of course , as we now know , WMD were never found , and , worse , evidence came to light showing that Blair was aware that the Bush administration was committed to regime change , regardless of their existence . 
The infamous Downing Street memorandum of July 23 , 2002 , eight months before the outbreak of war , stated explicitly that &quot; The intelligence and the facts were being fixed around the policy . &quot; 
In short , when Blair took Britain to war , he deliberately misled Parliament and the electorate about the ostensible rationale for it . 
When no WMD were found , Blair fell back on the previously unavowed justification that the removal of Saddam Hussein was the &quot; right thing to do . &quot; 
Unfortunately , the Bush administration did not foresee that Saddam &apos;s removal would precipitate a multi-sided insurgency and civil war . 
These dangers were predictable , and the world now knows that the war has proved a terrible failure of American strategy , and may yet have even more catastrophic consequences . 
So why did Blair support it ? 
Part of the answer goes back to Blair &apos;s first big foreign policy adventure , NATO &apos;s intervention in Kosovo in 1999 . 
In 1998-1999 Serbia had embarked on violent repression of Kosovo &apos;s ethnic Albanian majority , driving roughly 400,000 Kosovars from their homes . 
Diplomatic efforts by the outside world proved ineffective , so in March 1999 , NATO began a 78-day bombing campaign against the Serbs . 
Blair was at the forefront among Western leaders in pressing for NATO action , and to justify this innovation in outside intervention he proclaimed &quot; a new doctrine of international community &quot; that made it a &quot; just war , &quot; because it was based on superior Western values . 
One of Blair &apos;s character flaws is self-righteousness , an excessive confidence - perhaps an extrapolation of his Christian faith - that he knows what is correct , and is therefore entitled to act accordingly . 
In the case of the Iraq war , Blair has never conceded that the war was mistaken in conception or disastrous in practice : for him , it was still &quot; the right thing to do . &quot; 
Blair leaves office before the full consequences of the Iraq war have been played out . 
There is no sign of an end to the sectarian violence , and little prospect that Iraq can become a peaceful , unitary democracy . 
Moreover , the convulsions in Iraq may well have incalculable repercussions throughout the Middle East . 
One consequence , from a British perspective , is that it is now virtually impossible to imagine that any future prime minister could engage in another big military adventure primarily out of loyalty to an American president . 
Indeed , it is possible that Blair , through his complicity in the Iraq war , has inflicted major damage on the very idea of a &quot; special relationship &quot; between Britain and the United States . 
This relationship was always more special for the British than for the Americans , who scarcely recognize its existence . 
But if it has now been discredited in the minds of the British people , the result may be a new element of independence into British strategic thinking . 
Another consequence is that Britain &apos;s moral standing has been damaged alongside that of the US . 
But the damage to America &apos;s moral position is more serious for the health of the world . 
It is uncertain whether Tony Blair could have dissuaded George Bush from waging war in Iraq . 
Nevertheless , by enthusiastically backing Bush &apos;s war , his legacy will forever remain deeply compromised .
