A Confederal Solution for Palestine 
LONDON - Last month , while in New York City , I happened to be staying in the same hotel as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu . 
To accommodate his security needs , the hotel had been converted into a fortress , much like Israel itself . 
Netanyahu was in the United States for yet another round of Middle East peace talks . 
The US offered various sweeteners to induce Israel to freeze its West Bank settlement construction for another 90 days . 
The Israelis refused ; another impasse was reached . 
What , then , might be the prospects of a negotiated peace between two peoples with claims to the same land ? 
The answer is : very poor . 
All peace efforts since the Oslo accords of 1993 have been based on the &quot; two-state solution , &quot; according to which Israel is supposed to turn over the occupied territories to a Palestinian state , the Palestinians are supposed to renounce any claims on the Jewish state , and everyone is supposed to live happily ever after . 
A negotiated &quot; land for peace &quot; solution still remains official Western doctrine . 
As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in a recent speech , &quot; a just , lasting , and comprehensive peace &quot; has to be based on &quot; two states for two peoples . &quot; 
Meanwhile , the two main parties to the dispute , Palestine and Israel , are searching for unilateral alternatives to the stymied &quot; peace process . &quot; 
The Palestinians are pushing for international recognition of their statehood , while the Israelis are using their settlement policy to preempt a Palestinian state . 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said that , if the latest peace talks collapse , he will press for UN recognition of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders . 
This month , Brazil and Argentina recognized &quot; Palestine , &quot; and a cascade of Latin American countries is expected to follow . 
Abbas is now setting his sights on Europe , and would ask Turkey to serve as a go-between . 
The game is to use international recognition of an independent Palestinian state to pressure the US to retreat from its almost unconditional support for Israeli policy . 
Israel &apos;s main concern continues to be security . 
The official Western doctrine is that Israel &apos;s long-term security depends on the success of the &quot; peace process . &quot; 
In practice , Israel has been taking other measures to secure its future . 
Media attention has been focused on the &quot; security wall , &quot; which has certainly succeeded in reducing the level of violence . 
But , to the hawks who now control Israeli politics , the key to Israel &apos;s security depends on depth of defense , for which expansion of the settlements is indispensable . 
The hawks &quot; recipe for survival is threefold : continued military and economic support from the US , defensible frontiers through a strategic settlement program , and the carve-up of the Palestinian West Bank into disconnected bantustans , or subordinate authorities , incapable of concerted opposition to Israeli policy . 
Thus , while Abbas seeks to create a new &quot; fact on the ground &quot; by drumming up international support for a Palestinian state , Israel aims to trump him by making such a state unviable . 
The ideal alternative to both strategies is a peace process that aims not to create two states , but rather to establish the political and economic basis for a single confederal state . 
Indeed , the two-state solution was always an illusion . 
There was never enough land to satisfy the passionate possessiveness of all those with claims to it . 
Israeli Jews are bound to stay in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , and Israeli Arabs are bound to stay in Israel proper . 
These are the &quot; facts on the ground &quot; that doom Palestinian hopes for a sovereign Palestinian state no less than Israeli hopes for a wholly Jewish state . 
Moreover , land for peace never made sense from an economic point of view . 
If compensation for wrongs to the Palestinians was to be the guiding principle , there were always better ways of going about it than to found a rickety , poverty-ridden new country dependent on foreign aid . 
Most people have forgotten that the Paris Protocols of April 1994 established a customs union between Israel and the occupied territories , with a joint Economic Council to adjudicate trade disputes . 
It could also have been the basis of a confederal state , whose Palestinian part would have benefited from the West Bank settlers &quot; productivity and taxes . 
But this benign prospect was undermined by the violence needed to maintain the Jewish state and enable the emergence of a Palestinian one . 
But it is just possible that unilateral Israeli policy , implicitly backed by the US , will create interim conditions of peace that are sufficient for economic growth to cool Palestinian nationalism . 
The Palestinian cause is not the overriding preoccupation of even the Arab states , so Netanyahu &apos;s strategy of defense in depth stands a better chance of success than Abbas &apos;s pursuit of statehood through international recognition . 
Netanyahu &apos;s project is not moral .
