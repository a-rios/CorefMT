The Year of Sustainable Development 
NEW YORK - The year 2015 will be our generation &apos;s greatest opportunity to move the world toward sustainable development . 
Three high-level negotiations between July and December can reshape the global development agenda , and give an important push to vital changes in the workings of the global economy . 
With United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon &apos;s call to action in his report &quot; The Road to Dignity , &quot; the Year of Sustainable Development has begun . 
In July 2015 , world leaders will meet in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , to chart reforms of the global financial system . 
In September 2015 , they will meet again to approve Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) to guide national and global policies to 2030 . 
The fundamental goal of these summits is to put the world on a course toward sustainable development , or inclusive and sustainable growth . 
The world economy is reasonably good at achieving economic growth , but it fails to ensure that prosperity is equitably shared and environmentally sustainable . 
The reason is simple : The world &apos;s largest companies relentlessly - and rather successfully - pursue their own profits , all too often at the expense of economic fairness and the environment . 
Profit maximization does not guarantee a reasonable distribution of income or a safe planet . 
On the contrary , the global economy is leaving vast numbers of people behind , including in the richest countries , while planet Earth itself is under unprecedented threat , owing to human-caused climate change , pollution , water depletion , and the extinction of countless species . 
The SDGs are premised on the need for rapid far-reaching change . 
As John F. Kennedy put it a half-century ago : &quot; By defining our goal more clearly , by making it seem more manageable and less remote , we can help all people to see it , to draw hope from it , and to move irresistibly toward it . &quot; 
This is , in essence , Ban &apos;s message to the UN member states : Let us define the SDGs clearly , and thereby inspire citizens , businesses , governments , scientists , and civil society around the world to move toward them . 
The main objectives of the SDGs have already been agreed . 
A committee of the UN General Assembly identified 17 target areas , including the eradication of extreme poverty , ensuring education and health for all , and fighting human-induced climate change . 
The General Assembly as a whole has spoken in favor of these priorities . 
The key remaining step is to turn them into a workable set of goals . 
When the SDGs were first proposed in 2012 , the UN &apos;s member said that they &quot; should be action-oriented , &quot; &quot; easy to communicate , &quot; and &quot; limited in number , &quot; with many governments favoring a total of perhaps 10-12 goals encompassing the 17 priority areas . 
Achieving the SDGs will require deep reform of the global financial system , the key purpose of July &apos;s Conference on Financing for Development . 
Resources need to be channeled away from armed conflict , tax loopholes for the rich , and wasteful outlays on new oil , gas , and coal development toward priorities such as health , education , and low-carbon energy , as well as stronger efforts to combat corruption and capital flight . 
The July summit will seek to elicit from the world &apos;s governments a commitment to allocate more funds to social needs . 
It will also identify better ways to ensure that development aid reaches the poor , taking lessons from successful programs such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria . 
One such innovation should be a new Global Fund for Education , to ensure that children everywhere can afford to attend school at least through the secondary level . 
We also need better ways to channel private money toward sustainable infrastructure , such as wind and solar power . 
These goals are within reach . 
Indeed , they are the only way for us to stop wasting trillions of dollars on financial bubbles , useless wars , and environmentally destructive forms of energy . 
Success in July and September will give momentum to the decisive climate-change negotiations in Paris next December . 
Debate over human-induced global warming has been seemingly endless . 
In the 22 years since the world signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at the Rio Earth Summit , there has been far too little progress toward real action . 
As a result , 2014 is now likely to be the warmest year in recorded history , a year that has also brought devastating droughts , floods , high-impact storms , and heat waves . 
Back in 2009 and 2010 , the world &apos;s governments agreed to keep the rise in global temperature to below 2 Â° Celsius relative to the pre-industrial era . 
Yet warming is currently on course to reach 4-6 degrees by the end of the century - high enough to devastate global food production and dramatically increase the frequency of extreme weather events . 
That means a decisive shift from carbon-emitting energy sources like coal , oil , and gas , toward wind , solar , nuclear , and hydroelectric power , as well as the adoption of carbon capture and storage technologies when fossil fuels continue to be used . 
Dirty high-carbon energy must give way to clean low- and zero-carbon energy , and all energy must be used much more efficiently . 
A successful climate agreement next December should reaffirm the two-degree cap on warming ; include national &quot; decarbonization &quot; commitments up to 2030 and deep-decarbonization &quot; pathways &quot; ( or plans ) up to 2050 ; launch a massive global effort by both governments and businesses to improve the operating performance of low-carbon energy technologies ; and provide large-scale and reliable financial help to poorer countries as they face climate challenges . 
The United States , China , the European Union &apos;s members , and other countries are already signaling their intention to move in the right direction . 
The SDGs can create a path toward economic development that is technologically advanced , socially fair , and environmentally sustainable . 
Agreements at next year &apos;s three summits will not guarantee the success of sustainable development , but they can certainly orient the global economy in the right direction . 
The chance will not come along again in our generation .
