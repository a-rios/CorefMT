Slow Growth and Short Tails 
NEW YORK - The global economy had another difficult year in 2013 . 
The advanced economies &quot; below-trend growth continued , with output rising at an average annual rate of about 1 % , while many emerging markets experienced a slowdown to below-trend 4.8 % growth . 
After a year of subpar 2.9 % global growth , what does 2014 hold in store for the world economy ? 
The good news is that economic performance will pick up modestly in both advanced economies and emerging markets . 
The advanced economies , benefiting from a half-decade of painful private-sector deleveraging ( households , banks , and non-financial firms ) , a smaller fiscal drag ( with the exception of Japan ) , and maintenance of accommodative monetary policies , will grow at an annual pace closer to 1.9 % . 
Moreover , so-called tail risks ( low-probability , high-impact shocks ) will be less salient in 2014 . 
The threat , for example , of a eurozone implosion , another government shutdown or debt-ceiling fight in the United States , a hard landing in China , or a war between Israel and Iran over nuclear proliferation , will be far more subdued . 
Still , most advanced economies ( the US , the eurozone , Japan , the United Kingdom , Australia , and Canada ) will barely reach potential growth , or will remain below it . 
Households , banks , and some non-financial firms in most advanced economies remain saddled with high debt ratios , implying continued deleveraging . 
High budget deficits and public-debt burdens will force governments to continue painful fiscal adjustment . 
And an abundance of policy and regulatory uncertainties will keep private investment spending in check . 
The outlook for 2014 is dampened by longer-term constraints as well . 
Indeed , there is a looming risk of secular stagnation in many advanced economies , owing to the adverse effect on productivity growth of years of underinvestment in human and physical capital . 
And the structural reforms that these economies need to boost their potential growth will be implemented too slowly . 
While the eurozone &apos;s tail risks are lower , its fundamental problems remain unresolved : low potential growth ; high unemployment ; still-high and rising levels of public debt ; loss of competitiveness and slow reduction of unit labor costs ( which a strong euro does not help ) ; and extremely tight credit rationing , owing to banks &quot; ongoing deleveraging . 
Meanwhile , progress toward a banking union will be slow , while no steps will be taken toward establishing a fiscal union , even as austerity fatigue and political risks in the eurozone &apos;s periphery grow . 
In Japan , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s government has made significant headway in overcoming almost two decades of deflation , thanks to monetary easing and fiscal expansion . 
The main uncertainties stem from the coming increase in the consumption tax and slow implementation of the third &quot; arrow &quot; of &quot; Abenomics , &quot; namely structural reforms and trade liberalization . 
In the US , economic performance in 2014 will benefit from the shale-energy revolution , improvement in the labor and housing markets , and the &quot; reshoring &quot; of manufacturing . 
The downside risks result from political gridlock in Congress ( particularly given the upcoming midterm election in November ) , which will continue to limit progress on long-term fiscal consolidation ; a lack of clarity about the Federal Reserve &apos;s planned exit from quantitative easing ( QE ) and zero policy rates ; and regulatory uncertainties . 
Emerging markets &quot; difficult year in 2013 reflected several factors , including China &apos;s economic slowdown , the end of the commodity super-cycle , and a fall in potential growth , owing to delays in launching structural reforms . 
Moreover , several major emerging economies were hit hard in the spring and summer , after the Fed &apos;s signal of a forthcoming exit from QE triggered a capital-flow reversal , exposing vulnerabilities stemming from loose monetary , fiscal , and credit policies in the boom years of cheap money and abundant inflows . 
Emerging economies will grow faster in 2014 - closer to 5 % year on year - for several reasons . 
Brisker recovery in advanced economies will boost imports from emerging markets . 
The Fed &apos;s exit from QE will be slow , keeping interest rates low . 
Policy reforms in China will attenuate the risk of a hard landing . 
And , with many emerging markets still urbanizing and industrializing , their rising middle classes will consume more goods and services . 
Still , some emerging markets - namely , India , Indonesia , Brazil , Turkey , South Africa , Hungary , Ukraine , Argentina , and Venezuela - will remain fragile in 2014 , owing to large external and fiscal deficits , slowing growth , below-target inflation , and election-related political tensions . 
Some of these countries - for example , Indonesia - have recently undertaken more policy adjustment and will be subject to lower risks , though their growth and asset markets remain vulnerable to policy and political uncertainties and potential external shocks . 
The better-performing emerging markets are those with fewer macroeconomic , policy , and financial weaknesses : South Korea , the Philippines , Malaysia , and other Asian industrial exporters ; 
Poland and the Czech Republic in Europe ; 
Chile , Colombia , Peru , and Mexico in Latin America ; 
Kenya , Rwanda , and a few other economies in Sub-Saharan Africa ; and the Gulf oil-exporting countries . 
Finally , China will maintain an annual growth rate above 7 % in 2014 . 
But , despite the reforms set out by the Third Plenum of the Communist Party &apos;s Central Committee , the shift in China &apos;s growth model from fixed investment toward private consumption will occur too slowly . 
Many vested interests , including local governments and state-owned enterprises , are resisting change ; a huge volume of private and public debt will go sour ; and the country &apos;s leadership is divided on how quickly reforms should be implemented . 
So , while China will avoid a hard landing in 2014 , its medium-term prospects remain worrisome . 
In sum , the global economy will grow faster in 2014 , while tail risks will be lower . 
But , with the possible exception of the US , growth will remain anemic in most advanced economies , and emerging-market fragility - including China &apos;s uncertain efforts at economic rebalancing - could become a drag on global growth in subsequent years .
