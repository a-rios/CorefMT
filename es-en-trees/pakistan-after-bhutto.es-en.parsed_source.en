Pakistan after Bhutto 
The assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has brought Pakistan &apos;s state of turmoil to new heights . 
As head of the nation &apos;s most popular political party , Bhutto largely transcended Pakistan &apos;s ethnic and sectarian divides . 
Her return from exile in October was seen as a step toward curbing the country &apos;s dangerous fragmentation ; her murder shatters those hopes . 
President Pervez Musharraf must take immediate steps - most importantly , the formation of a national unity government - to prevent Pakistan from tearing apart at the seams . 
In deciding that her People &apos;s Party would participate in the January parliamentary election , Bhutto threw a lifeline to Musharraf , who has been beset by multiple insurgencies , a nationwide terrorist threat , and rock-bottom legitimacy . 
Both Musharraf and his supporters in Washington hoped that mainstream parties &quot; participation in the election would end Pakistan &apos;s governance crisis and provide popular support for a decisive confrontation with the Taliban and al-Qaeda . 
Now , however , the election will likely be postponed . 
Indeed , Musharraf might be compelled to impose emergency rule again , as he did in November , should Pakistan &apos;s stability further deteriorate . 
There are reports of violence in cities across Pakistan . 
Karachi , a multi-ethnic metropolis , could erupt into full-scale chaos . 
During the 1990 &quot; s , violence there between Bhutto &apos;s party and a local ethnic party - now allied with Musharraf - took thousands of lives . 
In these circumstances , a state of emergency could be warranted . 
But , given Musharraf &apos;s lack of legitimacy , such a move would further infuriate Bhutto &apos;s supporters , whose street power Bhutto had contained since October . 
This could set the stage for a violent confrontation between the Pakistani masses and Musharraf &apos;s regime . 
The nightmare scenario envisioned by many in Pakistan ­ ­ - a nuclear-armed country actively targeted by al-Qaeda and the Taliban - could become a reality . 
But this need not be a foregone conclusion . 
Musharraf , who regularly claims to act on the basis of a &quot; Pakistan first &quot; policy , must now let go of partisan objectives and form a national unity government led by a prime minister from the opposition . 
Any subsequent measures , including temporary imposition of emergency rule and full-scale war against the terrorists , require the complete support of the opposition parties . 
Musharraf and his political allies cannot be seen as benefiting from Bhutto &apos;s assassination ; nor can they afford the perception of a cover-up . 
His opponents must be incorporated into the decision-making process . 
A national unity government must assume three major responsibilities . 
First , it must establish an independent commission to determine who was responsible for Bhutto &apos;s murder . 
While political assassination is not unfamiliar - Pakistan &apos;s first prime minister was killed in the same park where Bhutto was murdered - it is imperative that the culprits be apprehended and tried . 
Anything short of this would permanently taint Pakistan &apos;s leadership and impede all attempts at political reconciliation . 
Second , it must take necessary measures to ensure public safety and political stability , while paving the way for free and fair elections . 
It must offer Pakistan a consensual path toward winning back its tribal areas from the insurgents , end the wave of terror in its cities , and ensure the election of a new , legitimate government . 
Finally , it must begin a dialogue with Musharraf and the military on a permanent , constitutional separation of powers . 
If Bhutto had not been assassinated and , instead , successfully became prime minister , she would likely have clashed with Musharraf over his arbitrary empowerment of the presidency at the expense of the premiership . 
The issue will not go away with Bhutto &apos;s death . 
Pakistan &apos;s civil and military elite must create a broad consensus - perhaps with foreign assistance , but never with foreign meddling - on the constitutional roles of the prime minister , president , and the military . 
Ravaged by endemic elite discord since its founding , Pakistan desperately needs an elite reconciliation that includes all of the country &apos;s major stakeholders . 
Otherwise , Pakistan &apos;s terrorists , who feed off of political instability , will continue to gain , while the country &apos;s poor and illiterate majority will continue to lose ground . 
The murder of Benazir Bhutto need not result in the country &apos;s demise . 
Pakistan &apos;s elite have an opportunity to overcome their differences , unite in opposition to militants , and transform their failing state into a stable and prosperous democracy . 
If they succeed in bringing about a national renewal , Bhutto , a monumental political figure in Pakistani history , will not have died in vain .
