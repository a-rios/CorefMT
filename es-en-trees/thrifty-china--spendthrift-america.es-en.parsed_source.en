Thrifty China , Spendthrift America 
The saving rate in China is the highest of any major country . 
China &apos;s gross saving rate ( the percentage of GDP that is not consumed immediately ) , which includes both public and private saving , is around 50 % . 
By contrast , the saving rate in the United States is the lowest of any major country - roughly 10 % of GDP . 
Almost all other countries fall between these two extremes . 
Differences in saving rates matter a lot , and must be a major reason that China &apos;s annual economic growth rate is now a full six percentage points higher than in the US . 
Saving in China is in part a virtuous circle : rapid economic growth leads to high saving , which in turn sustains rapid growth . 
The difference between Chinese and US saving rates has been growing for decades . 
In the early 1980 &quot; s , China &apos;s saving rate was twice as high . 
Now it is five times higher . 
Why are these trajectories so different ? 
Unfortunately , explaining saving rates is not an exact science . 
Some patterns across countries are obvious . 
Oil-rich countries tend to save a lot . 
Countries with serious internal crises or conflicts tend to save little . 
Some part of the high saving rates in China since the early 1980 &quot; s might be due to the decline in public confidence about health care , retirement benefits , and education , and a weakened sense of job security . 
However , the same factors seem to be working in the same direction for saving in the US , too . 
Engrained habits probably exlain more about China &apos;s saving rate . 
When incomes are growing rapidly , as they are in China , it is easier to save because people are not yet accustomed to a higher standard of living and do not mind terribly much maintaining a lower one for a while longer . 
They also tolerate enterprise or government policies that encourage high saving . 
For example , the uptrend in saving in China began at around the same time as its one-child policy was implemented in 1979 . 
The late Nobel laureate economist Franco Modigliani , in his last major published paper in 2004 ( co-authored with Shi Larry Cao ) , argued that this demographic change explains much of the increase in the saving rate , as Chinese substituted investment in capital for investment in children . 
But income growth and demographics do not explain everything . 
After all , the virtuous circle of high savings and rapid growth operates more strongly in China than in other developing countries where incomes are rising and birth rates are falling . 
This suggests that there are other , deeper factors that underlie the differences in Chinese and US saving rates - factors that reflect different life experiences and how these experiences are filtered through the two countries &quot; cultures . 
For one thing , although the Chinese don &apos;t elect their leaders , they trust their government more . 
According to recent World Values Surveys , 96.7 % of Chinese expressed confidence in their government , compared to only 37.3 % of Americans . 
Likewise , 83.5 % of Chinese thought their country is run for all the people , rather than for a few big interest groups , whereas only 36.7 % of Americans thought the same of their country . 
With this relatively higher trust , China &apos;s government and enterprises are better able to enact and implement strict policies that promote saving and growth . 
Moreover , while economic inequality is on the rise in both countries , Chinese and Americans comprehend this very differently . 
In the US , widely called &quot; the land of opportunity , &quot; the shame of being poor is unbearable , and there are no cultural resources to enable such people to maintain self-esteem , especially when the country is so successful overall . 
As inequality deepens , many who fall behind struggle to save face , consuming in order to maintain the appearance of success . 
At the same time , those who rise from low economic status revel in their newfound wealth by engaging in spectacular displays of personal spending . 
By contrast , poor people in China mostly view their personal situation as transitional . 
People still remember the Cultural Revolution and view themselves as survivors of a shared traumatic experience , underpinning a commitment to collective sacrifice in order to rebuild the country . 
There is no shame in being poor in China if one reflects that one &apos;s children or grandchildren will be wealthy and successful . 
On the contrary , as in postwar Germany , it is a matter of pride that one is working hard through a difficult situation that will later be remembered as a historic transition . 
In the US , one &apos;s income is a dark secret that one might not reveal even to one &apos;s own spouse . 
In China , people tell each other how much they earn with relative ease . 
Especially in Chinese villages , people know how their neighbors are faring . 
Conspicuous consumption becomes less important when people already know your income . 
Of course , Chinese increasingly consume fancy new cars and designer clothes . 
More vivid in people &apos;s minds are the stories they will one day tell their grandchildren about their travails and their economic heroism . 
China will most likely be saving more than the US for years to come . 
Today &apos;s children will not view their own life stories from the perspective of the difficulties China has experienced . 
As this change unfolds , the enormous willingness to save , and to tolerate high-saving government policies , will fade .
