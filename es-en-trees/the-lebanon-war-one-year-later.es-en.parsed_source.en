The Lebanon War One Year Later 
LONDON  -  
With its decision to send thousands of soldiers to Lebanon to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 , the EU took its boldest step yet in creating a common foreign and security policy . 
The Israel-Hezbollah war of 2006 reminded the Union , once again , that its strategic interests do not always coincide perfectly with those of the United States . 
Because the Bush administration took a &quot; hands off &quot; approach to the Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon , and given the military straitjacket the US finds itself in because of the Iraq war , the EU had to take the lead . 
The EU remains - for now - relatively uncontaminated by America &apos;s disintegrating reputation in the Middle East . 
But the Union could see its reputation worsen if it allows its commitment to Lebanon to become part of the emerging US strategy of isolating Iran by hardening today &apos;s regional Sunni-Shia divisions . 
To avoid this fate , the EU &apos;s commitment in Lebanon needs to be supplemented with a nuanced political strategy that seeks to avoid isolating Lebanon &apos;s long suppressed Shia population . 
The threats emanating from the Middle East are diverse : regional conflicts , totalitarian religious ideologies ( mainly led by Shia Iran and Wahhabi Saudi Arabia ) , terrorism , nuclear armament programs , obstacles to modernization , and unstable regimes . 
All of these affect Lebanon , and are aggravated by the country &apos;s own peculiar socio-political dynamics - i.e. , its Maronite , Sunni , and Shia divisions . 
The EU &apos;s mission in Lebanon is risky . 
Neither Hezbollah nor Syria , let alone Iran , has an interest in stability without some say in creating it . 
Resolution 1701 presupposes - in addition to separating the combatants - enforcement of the internal and external sovereignty of Lebanon &apos;s elected government , without saying how this is to be accomplished given Hezbollah &apos;s superior military power relative to the government &apos;s forces . 
In effect , the resolution envisaged reversing Hezbollah &apos;s gains and ignores the deep changes that have occurred in Lebanese society , most importantly the Shia community &apos;s growing self-confidence . 
Attempting to politically isolate and disarm Hezbollah is a task that the EU-led UN force cannot accomplish and should not attempt , for it would mean war , with Syria and Iran in the background . 
But were the EU to resign itself to mere observer status in Lebanon , the UN and Europe would lose all credibility . 
An armed peace has held for a year . But an armed peace never lasts . 
The mission must therefore walk a fine line to bridge the country &apos;s communal divisions , which will be possible only with a clear understanding of Lebanon and the wider Middle East . 
The road toward peace rather than ceasefire in Lebanon precludes the EU &apos;s participation in America &apos;s emerging &quot; containment &quot; strategy vis-Ã -vis Iran , at least in its current form , which is based on organizing the resistance of Sunni states to Shia influence . 
For the Shia are the biggest of Lebanon &apos;s three religious communities . 
So a neat Shia-Sunni dividing line cannot be drawn . 
Giving the Shia a real stake in the nations in which they live is the only way to satisfy the craving for empowerment that they feel after so many years of suppression . 
Europe must also recognize why leaders like Hezbollah &apos;s Sheikh Hasan Nasrullah are popular . 
Anti-Americanism and an aggressive foreign policy are , of course , part of the allure of men like Nasrullah . 
The US and the political groups that it tends to support in the region , by contrast , offer very little in this regard . 
The Bush administration stresses democracy and human rights , which is a good agenda as far as it goes . 
In places like south Lebanon , which suffer from deep social cleavages and inequalities , free elections and free trade hold little resonance for people who are impoverished and marginalized . 
If the EU mission is to compete successfully against Lebanon &apos;s Islamists and populists , it must start thinking seriously about a social agenda that appeals to the poor . 
Of course , no one wants to break budgets or create dependency .
