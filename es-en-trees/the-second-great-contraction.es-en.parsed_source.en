The Second Great Contraction 
CAMBRIDGE - Why is everyone still referring to the recent financial crisis as the &quot; Great Recession &quot; ? 
The term , after all , is predicated on a dangerous misdiagnosis of the problems that confront the United States and other countries , leading to bad forecasts and bad policy . 
The phrase &quot; Great Recession &quot; creates the impression that the economy is following the contours of a typical recession , only more severe - something like a really bad cold . 
That is why , throughout this downturn , forecasters and analysts who have tried to make analogies to past post-war US recessions have gotten it so wrong . 
Moreover , too many policymakers have relied on the belief that , at the end of the day , this is just a deep recession that can be subdued by a generous helping of conventional policy tools , whether fiscal policy or massive bailouts . 
But the real problem is that the global economy is badly overleveraged , and there is no quick escape without a scheme to transfer wealth from creditors to debtors , either through defaults , financial repression , or inflation . 
A more accurate , if less reassuring , term for the ongoing crisis is the &quot; Second Great Contraction . &quot; 
Carmen Reinhart and I proposed this moniker in our 2009 book This Time is Different , based on our diagnosis of the crisis as a typical deep financial crisis , not a typical deep recession . 
The first &quot; Great Contraction &quot; of course , was the Great Depression , as emphasized by Anna Schwarz and the late Milton Friedman . 
The contraction applies not only to output and employment , as in a normal recession , but to debt and credit , and the deleveraging that typically takes many years to complete . 
Why argue about semantics ? 
Well , imagine you have pneumonia , but you think it is only a bad cold . 
You could easily fail to take the right medicine , and you would certainly expect your life to return to normal much faster than is realistic . 
In a conventional recession , the resumption of growth implies a reasonably brisk return to normalcy . 
The economy not only regains its lost ground , but , within a year , it typically catches up to its rising long-run trend . 
The aftermath of a typical deep financial crisis is something completely different . 
As Reinhart and I demonstrated , it typically takes an economy more than four years just to reach the same per capita income level that it had attained at its pre-crisis peak . 
So far , across a broad range of macroeconomic variables , including output , employment , debt , housing prices , and even equity , our quantitative benchmarks based on previous deep post-war financial crises have proved far more accurate than conventional recession logic . 
Many commentators have argued that fiscal stimulus has largely failed not because it was misguided , but because it was not large enough to fight a &quot; Great Recession . &quot; 
But , in a &quot; Great Contraction , &quot; problem number one is too much debt . 
If governments that retain strong credit ratings are to spend scarce resources effectively , the most effective approach is to catalyze debt workouts and reductions . 
For example , governments could facilitate the write-down of mortgages in exchange for a share of any future home-price appreciation . 
An analogous approach can be done for countries . For example , rich countries &quot; voters in Europe could perhaps be persuaded to engage in a much larger bailout for Greece ( one that is actually big enough to work ) , in exchange for higher payments in ten to fifteen years if Greek growth outperforms . 
Is there any alternative to years of political gyrations and indecision ? 
In my December 2008 column , I argued that the only practical way to shorten the coming period of painful deleveraging and slow growth would be a sustained burst of moderate inflation , say , 4-6 % for several years . 
Of course , inflation is an unfair and arbitrary transfer of income from savers to debtors . 
But , at the end of the day , such a transfer is the most direct approach to faster recovery . 
Eventually , it will take place one way or another , anyway , as Europe is painfully learning . 
Some observers regard any suggestion of even modestly elevated inflation as a form of heresy . 
But Great Contractions , as opposed to recessions , are very infrequent events , occurring perhaps once every 70 or 80 years . 
These are times when central banks need to spend some of the credibility that they accumulate in normal times . 
The big rush to jump on the &quot; Great Recession &quot; bandwagon happened because most analysts and policymakers simply had the wrong framework in mind . 
Unfortunately , by now it is far too clear how wrong they were . 
Acknowledging that we have been using the wrong framework is the first step toward finding a solution . 
History suggests that recessions are often renamed when the smoke clears . 
Perhaps today the smoke will clear a bit faster if we dump the &quot; Great Recession &quot; label immediately and replace it with something more apt , like &quot; Great Contraction . &quot; 
It is too late to undo the bad forecasts and mistaken policies that have marked the aftermath of the financial crisis , but it is not too late to do better .
