The Cacophony of the World 
PARIS - In his masterpiece Diplomacy , Henry Kissinger describes , probably too idyllically , the international balance-of-power system that , following the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815 , produced what came to be called the &quot; Concert of Europe . &quot; 
As Kissinger describes it , after the Napoleonic Wars , &quot; There was not only a physical equilibrium , but a moral one . 
Power and justice were in substantial harmony . &quot; 
Of course , the concert ended in cacophony with the outbreak of World War I in the summer of 1914 . 
Today , after the brutality of the first half of the twentieth century , the temporary bipolarity of the Cold War , and America &apos;s brief post-1989 hyperpower status , the world is once again searching for a new international order . 
Can something like the Concert of Europe be globalized ? 
Unfortunately , global cacophony seems more probable . 
One obvious reason is the absence of a recognized and accepted international referee . 
The United States , which best embodies ultimate power , is less willing - and less able - to exercise it . 
And the United Nations , which best embodies the principles of international order , is as divided and impotent as ever . 
But , beyond the absence of a referee , another issue looms : the wave of globalization that followed the end of the Cold War has , paradoxically , accelerated fragmentation , affecting democratic and non-democratic countries alike . 
From the collapse of the Soviet Union , Yugoslavia &apos;s violent self-destruction , and Czechoslovakia &apos;s peaceful divorce to today &apos;s centrifugal pressures in Europe , the West , and the major emerging countries , fragmentation has been fundamental to international relations in recent decades . 
The information revolution has created a more global , interdependent , and transparent world than ever . 
But this has led , in turn , to an anxious , balkanizing quest for identity . 
This effort to recover uniqueness is largely the cause of the international system &apos;s growing fragmentation . 
In the Concert of Europe , the number of actors was limited , and they were mostly states , whether national or imperial . 
Essential values were widely shared , and most actors favored protecting the existing order . 
In today &apos;s world , by contrast , the nature of the actors involved is no longer so clear . 
Transnational forces , states , and non-state actors are all involved , and their goals are complex and sometimes contradictory , with no universal commitment to preserving the status quo . 
The US may be intent on creating a transatlantic trade-and-investment pact with Europe , which would make a political statement to the world that the West writ large constitutes the universal normative reference point . 
But does such a West exist ? 
In our era of fragmentation , there is a more powerful and dynamic American West , a globally more problematic European West ( itself fragmented between a prosperous north and an economically lagging south ) , and even a British West and , in Japan , an Asian West . 
The concept of the BRICs ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) may have been an astute branding tool . 
But , aside from its members &quot; high growth rates , has it had any real significance ? 
Indeed , China is clearly in a category of its own , as a source of perceived ( or real ) risk to its regional environment . 
If the BRICs &quot; growth slows ( as has begun to happen ) , the concept &apos;s artificiality will become widely apparent . 
What unites emerging powers today is more their denial of international responsibilities than their joint diplomatic efforts . 
Fragmentation also affects societies internally . 
Deep partisan divisions - whether over the role of government or social / cultural issues - are leading to near-paralysis in democratic societies like the US . 
In non-democratic societies , they can lead to revolution and violent power struggles . 
This has been the case in much of the Arab world since late 2010 . 
Even power itself is more fragmented than ever . 
Indeed , Moises Naim proclaims its demise in his latest book , The End of Power : From Boardrooms to Battlefields and Churches to States , Why Being in Charge Isn &apos;t What It Used To Be . 
While Naim &apos;s conclusion may be premature , he is right about one thing : &quot; Power no longer buys as much as it did in the past . &quot; 
It is &quot; easier to get , harder to use - and easier to lose . &quot; 
Some analysts maintain , reassuringly , that rapprochement between Asia and the West is possible , given symbiosis between Western democracy and authoritarian Confucianism . 
This is Kishore Mahbubani &apos;s argument in his book The Great Convergence . 
But the harmony stemming from the encounter between different cultures and systems is nowhere near - and will not be as long as the rule of law has not taken hold in the emerging world and a culture of modesty has not made headway within the plural West . 
The cacophony of the world has replaced the concert of Europe . 
And this may very well be the case for the foreseeable future .
