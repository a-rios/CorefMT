Imagining Recession 
The world &apos;s housing , oil , and stock markets have been plunged into turmoil in recent months . 
Why ? 
Ultimately , consumer and business confidence are mostly irrational . 
The psychology of the markets is dominated by the public images that we have in mind from day to day , and that form the basis of our imaginations and of the stories we tell each other . 
Popular images of past disasters are part of our folklore , often buried in the dim reaches of our memory , but re-emerging to trouble us from time to time . 
Like traditional myths , such graphic , shared images embody fears that are deeply entrenched in our psyche . 
The images that have accompanied past episodes of market turmoil are largely absent today . 
Consider the oil crisis that began in November 1973 , resulting in a world stock market crash and a sharp world recession . 
Vivid images have stuck in people &apos;s minds from that episode : long lines of cars at gas stations , people riding bicycles to work , gasless Sundays and other rationing schemes . 
Today , the real price of oil is nearly twice as high as it was at the peak of that crisis , but we have seen nothing like the images from 1973-5 . 
Mostly we are not even reminded of them . 
So our confidence is not shaken , yet . 
Just before the October 19 , 1987 , stock market crash , the biggest one-day drop in history , the image on people &apos;s minds was the crash of 1929 . 
Indeed , the Wall Street Journal ran a story about it on the morning of the 1987 crash . 
I know that those images contributed to the severity of the 1987 crash by encouraging people to sell , because I ran a survey of individual and institutional investors the following week . 
Images of 1929 - of financiers leaping from buildings , unemployed men sleeping on park benches , long lines at soup kitchens , and impoverished boys selling apples on the street - are not on our minds now . 
The 1929 crash just does not seem relevant to most people today , probably because we survived the 1987 and 2000 crashes with few ill effects , while 1929 seems not only the distant past , but another world . 
But images of the 1987 crash , driven by computers in tall modern steel-and-glass office buildings , do seem to be on people &apos;s minds today . 
The stock market suffered one of its biggest one-day drops this year on the 20th anniversary of the 1987 crash , with the S P 500 falling 2.56 % . 
No previous anniversary of the 1987 crash showed any such drop . 
The image of a bank run , of long lines of angry people lining up outside a failed bank , was briefly on our minds after the Northern Rock failure in Britain . 
The images that are uppermost in our minds are of a housing crisis . 
We imagine residential streets with one &quot; for sale &quot; sign after another . 
Worse , there are images of foreclosures , of families being evicted from their homes , their furniture and belongings on the street . 
If home prices continue to decline in the United States and possibly elsewhere , there could be many more vivid images . 
You may yet be presented with the image of your child &apos;s playmate moving away because his parents were thrown out in a foreclosure . 
You may see a house down the street trashed by an angry owner who was foreclosed . 
Such images become part of your sense of reality , and could disturb your sense of confidence and reduce your willingness to spend and support the economy . 
Could such changes in psychology be big enough to tip us into a world recession ? 
While it is far from clear that they will , it is a possibility . 
Psychology need only change enough to bring about a drop in consumption or investment growth of a percentage point or so of world GDP , and market repercussions can do the rest .
