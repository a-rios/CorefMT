Thinking Smaller in Europe 
NEW YORK - To resolve a crisis in which the impossible has become possible , it is necessary to think the unthinkable . 
So , to resolve Europe &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis , it is now imperative to prepare for the possibility of default and defection from the eurozone by Greece , Portugal , and perhaps Ireland . 
In such a scenario , measures will have to be taken to prevent a financial meltdown in the eurozone as a whole . 
First , bank deposits must be protected . 
Moreover , some banks in the defaulting countries would have to be kept functioning in order to prevent economic collapse . 
At the same time , the European banking system would have to be recapitalized and put under European , as distinct from national , supervision . 
Finally , government bonds issued by the eurozone &apos;s other deficit countries would have to be protected from contagion . 
( The last two requirements would apply even if no country defaulted . ) 
All of this would cost money , but , under the existing arrangements agreed by the eurozone &apos;s national leaders , no more money is to be found . 
So there is no alternative but to create the missing component : a European treasury with the power to tax and , therefore , to borrow . 
This would require a new treaty , transforming the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) into a full-fledged treasury . 
But this presupposes a radical change of heart , particularly in Germany . 
The German public still thinks that it has a choice about whether to support the euro . 
The euro exists , and the global financial system &apos;s assets and liabilities are so intermingled on the basis of the common currency that its collapse would cause a meltdown beyond the capacity of the German authorities - or any other - to contain . 
The longer it takes for the German public to realize this cold fact , the higher the price that they , and the rest of the world , will have to pay . 
The question is whether the German public can be convinced of this argument . 
Chancellor Angela Merkel may not be able to persuade her entire coalition of its merits , but she could rely on the opposition to build a new majority in support of doing what is necessary to preserve the euro . 
Having resolved the euro crisis , she would have less to fear from the next election . 
Preparing for the possible default or defection of three small countries from the euro does not mean that those countries would necessarily be abandoned . 
On the contrary , the possibility of an orderly default - financed by the other eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund - would offer Greece and Portugal policy choices . 
Moreover , it would end the vicious cycle - now threatening all of the eurozone &apos;s deficit countries - whereby austerity weakens their growth prospects , leading investors to demand prohibitively high interest rates and thus forcing their governments to cut spending further . 
Leaving the eurozone would make it easier for the most distressed countries to regain competitiveness . 
But , if they are willing to make the necessary sacrifices , they could also remain : the EFSF would protect their domestic bank deposits , and the IMF would help to recapitalize their banking systems , which would help these countries escape from their current trap . 
Either way , it is not in the European Union &apos;s interest to allow these countries to collapse and drag down the entire global banking system with them . 
The EU &apos;s member countries , and not only those in the eurozone , must accept that a new treaty is needed to save the euro . 
That logic is clear . 
So the discussions about what to include in such a new treaty ought to begin immediately , because , even with European leaders under extreme pressure to agree quickly , negotiations will necessarily be a prolonged affair . 
Once the principle is agreed , however , the European Council could authorize the ECB to step into the breach , indemnifying it from solvency risks in advance . 
Having in sight a solution to the eurozone &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis would be a source of relief for financial markets . 
Even so , because any new treaty &apos;s terms will inevitably be dictated by Germany , a severe economic slowdown would be almost certain . 
That might induce a further change of attitude in Germany , in turn allowing the adoption of counter-cyclical policies . 
At that point , growth in much of the eurozone could resume .
