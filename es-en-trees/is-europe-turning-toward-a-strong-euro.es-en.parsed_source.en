Is Europe Turning Toward A Strong Euro ? 
Is this a sign that the tide is turning in Europe in favor of a stronger euro ? 
Or does it simply reflect the fact that the ECB now is reverting to its old policy of not commenting on exchange rates whatever the circumstance ? 
The answer may come clearer at the June meeting next Thursday when the appreciating euro undoubtedly will be brought up once again at the press conference . 
Two factors point to a possible turning of the tide . 
One is the fact that crude oil is heading towards $ 75 a barrel or higher . 
Second , Europe &apos;s economic recovery is progressing to the point where exports are no longer the sole source of growth . 
Indeed , with sky-high prices of crude oil and base metals like copper , aluminum , and zinc , the rising euro has become a shield for Europe &apos;s ongoing economic recovery . 
These commodities , after all , are priced in US dollars . 
Because the euro has appreciated against the dollar , the euro price of crude oil and base metals has increased at a slower pace than their corresponding dollar prices . 
As the escalation of dollar commodity prices continues , so will Europe &apos;s appreciation of its stronger currency . 
The recently rising euro also has helped keep down European long-term interest rates - a key determinant of economic activity - as inflationary expectations deteriorated somewhat in the euro-zone area . 
During April , the rise in inflationary expectations and the euro &apos;s appreciation occurred more or less concurrently . 
The yield on the 10-year German bond , which might have been expected to go higher because of the deterioration in inflationary expectations during this period , barely moved . 
This is a big plus for sustaining economic recovery . 
Should Bush , Bernanke or the new Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson cause investors to lose faith in US financial assets at some point in time , the rising euro will help shield European interest rates from the consequences . 
Still , politicians and maybe even some central bankers continue to be concerned about the currency , because they fear that a stronger euro could stifle exports , thus weakening overall economic performance . 
But this fear is likely to diminish as Europe &apos;s recovery broadens past exports into the economy &apos;s domestic sectors . 
In fact , there is evidence that this is now happening . 
Surveys show that business confidence is up throughout the euro-zone economy , indicating that a domestic investment boom may be around the corner . 
Likewise , the new ECB growth forecasts may show the internal economy strengthening . 
In short , the fear that a stronger euro could kill the only goose laying the golden eggs is likely to recede in coming months . 
Of course , not everyone in Europe can be expected to be equally enthusiastic about a stronger euro . 
The euro zone is a vast area comprised of different nations with different cultures , histories , economies , politics , and so forth . 
Germany , with its history of a strong deutsche mark and very competitive costs , likes the strong euro more than , say , its partners , France and Italy , which have histories of weak domestic currencies and non-competitive export costs . 
The mere existence of a common currency is no guarantee that everyone will agree about what its value should be . 
Still , even in the traditionally weak-currency countries , changes afoot suggest that a turnaround in political attitudes and public opinion toward a stronger euro may be on the horizon . 
The recent election in Italy of a center-left government led by Romano Prodi is a case in point . 
Not only did the Northern League - an important component of Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s ousted right-wing coalition - favor a weak euro , but it also favored pulling Italy out of the euro altogether . 
Now it is out of power . 
So is Berlusconi himself , who favored a weak euro to compensate for Italy &apos;s economic inefficiency and the complete lack of reform during his years in office . 
Prodi , a convinced European , is less likely to favor a weak euro . 
Another promising change in Italy has been the appointment of Mario Draghi as Governor of the Bank of Italy . 
Draghi , a respected MIT economist , favors economic reform and understands the role that a strong euro plays in spurring it . 
Economic reform must be financed somehow , and if the funds are to come , at least in part , from outside the EU , the euro must be a strong currency . 
Draghi replaced Antonio Fazio , whose corrupt protectionist practices in Italy &apos;s banking sector had both discouraged capital from coming into Italy and depressed the euro . 
In the current global environment , the case for the strong euro is becoming increasingly apparent . 
Mr. Trichet &apos;s silence at the May ECB press conference on the rising euro could be a tacit acknowledgement of this new reality . 
We should learn more at next week &apos;s June meeting .
