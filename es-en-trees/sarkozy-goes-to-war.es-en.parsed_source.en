Sarkozy Goes to War 
PARIS - In 2003 , France , under President Jacques Chirac , took the lead in opposing America &apos;s planned invasion of Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq . 
French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin &apos;s flamboyant speech at the United Nations encapsulated the &quot; spirit of resistance &quot; against what proved to be a dangerous adventure . 
In 2011 , under President Nicolas Sarkozy , France has again taken a highly visible stand on a question of war and peace , except that now the French , together with the British , are leading the fight to protect Libya &apos;s people from their erratic , brutal leader , Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi . 
Why does France seem to crave such prominence ? 
In the eyes of the French , France &apos;s international status remains a key ingredient in forming their own national identity . 
The way we French are perceived by others affects how we perceive ourselves , and nothing is more troubling for us than to be perceived with indifference or , worse , not to be noticed at all . 
Suddenly , with the Libya issue , we can tell ourselves that we are catching up with Germany , whose pusillanimity is striking ; we are showing the way to the United States ; and the French ( and British ) flags are deployed in the streets of &quot; liberated &quot; Libya , together with that country &apos;s own new flag . 
France &apos;s seemingly natural propensity to intervene is reinforced in this case by three key factors : Sarkozy , Qaddafi , and the context of a wider Arab revolution . 
The Sarkozy factor is fundamental . 
The French president loves crises , with their concomitant surge of adrenaline . 
For him , this is what power is about : taking hard decisions under unfavorable circumstances . 
Of course , domestic considerations are not absent from Sarkozy &apos;s thinking . 
In 2007 , when he played a key role in the liberation of Bulgarian nurses imprisoned by Qaddafi , Libya &apos;s leader was rewarded with what looked like a legitimacy prize : an official visit to Paris . 
He was no longer a pariah , but an eccentric partner . 
Today , by contrast , it all looks as if intervention may re-legitimate Sarkozy in the eyes of French citizens , whose votes he will need in next year &apos;s presidential election . 
An energetic and daring gambler , Sarkozy is taking a high but legitimate risk that he can retake the moral ( and political ) high ground . 
Beyond Sarkozy is Qaddafi , the ideal villain . 
His behavior has been abominable for decades - and not only towards his people . 
The terrorist attacks on Western targets that he ordered include not only the Pan Am tragedy in Lockerbie , Scotland , but also a French UTA plane blown up over Africa . 
And not only is Qaddafi truly bad , but Libya is comparatively small , and his forces appear relatively weak ( this remains to be proven on the ground ) . 
Aside from these personality factors , there is the regional context . 
Preventing Qaddafi from rebuilding the wall of fear that fell in Tunisia and Egypt is essential if the &quot; Arab spring &quot; is not to be succeeded by a new winter of discontent . 
What is now done in the sky over Libya - sanctioned by international law and , unlike in Iraq in 2003 , with the ambivalent political support of the Arab League - is fundamental if the Arab revolutionaries are to take a positive view of the West . 
The West is not trying , as it did during the Crusades or the Imperialist conquests of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , to impose its religion or values on the Arabs . 
We have a duty to protect Arab lives and values , as Arabs themselves have requested . 
France has a common history and geography with the countries on the southern Mediterranean shore . 
The duty to intervene - and the cost of indifference - is probably higher for France than for any other Western country . 
Indeed , France has a very large immigrant population that originated in the Maghreb , and for which the &quot; Arab spring &quot; is vitally important and a source of fascination and pride . 
These positive identities constitute the best protection against the sirens of fundamentalist Islam . 
Of course , an ideal scenario implies that the intervention &quot; goes well , &quot; and that it does not incite confusion or chaos in Libya or the wider region . 
France , together with Great Britain , and with the more distant support of the US , is undeniably risking much , for it is easier to start a war than it is to end one . 
The cost of non-intervention , of allowing Qaddafi to crush his own people , and of thus signaling to the world &apos;s despots that a campaign of domestic terror is acceptable , is far more menacing . 
Sarkozy has chosen the right course . 
In fact , he has chosen the only possible way forward .
