Elections Without Winners 
When football matches - at least those that must produce a winner - end in a draw , a penalty shoot-out must resolve the matter , as this World Cup has demonstrated so dramatically . 
The shoot-out &apos;s individual competition for heroism or misery is really alien to such a team game as football , but it is accepted as a necessary way to resolve the stalemate . 
But when it comes to elections - which ideally should always produce a winner - there is no such device . 
Yet quite a few recent elections have ended in at least a near-stalemate . 
Mexico &apos;s presidential election is only the latest example . 
Several weeks ago , the general election in the Czech Republic yielded a total impasse , with the left and right each gaining 100 lower-house seats and no resolution in sight . 
In Italy , a curious rule that provides for the grouping which has a handful of votes more than the other to get a bonus of several dozen seats in the lower house . 
Romano Prodi &apos;s government must operate on a razor &apos;s edge in the Senate . 
There are other recent examples , including , perhaps most notoriously , the 2000 presidential election in the United States . 
Why are we suddenly experiencing so many close results in democratic elections ? 
How should we best deal with them ? 
And what do they do to the legitimacy of the governments that result from them ? 
The first question is the hardest to answer . 
To the committed observer , it does not appear that democratic countries &quot; electorates are so evenly divided along class or similar lines as to cause political stalemate . 
On the contrary , electorates everywhere seem more volatile than anything else , with voters prepared to change their preferences from one poll to the next . 
Often , they want change - just that . 
Nor is there any sign that political ideology has made a return among ordinary people . 
Yet nowadays divisions between candidates for office are deeper than ever - and are even sharper among party activists . 
This is certainly true in Latin America , where a wave of leftist populism has swept many countries . 
Several Europe countries , too , have revealed a less dramatic left-right split , with Spain and Italy - though not Poland and the Czech Republic - moving somewhat to the left . 
But the real issue is not so simple . 
Increasingly , the divisiveness of democratic polities reflects a combination of undecided voters , motivated by ephemeral sentiments , and the emergence of political activists , often focused on narrow issues , who exploit electoral volatility for their purposes . 
So what can be done in practical terms when division leads to stalemate ? 
One solution is to form a grand coalition , as in today &apos;s Germany . 
It is amazing to watch how quickly Christian Democrats and Social Democrats have forgotten their electoral promises and agreed on a program of higher taxation . 
One may doubt whether this will increase popular confidence in the political class , but for now , at least , the arrangement is working . 
Another possibility is to turn razor-thin majorities into one-sided governments that remain centrist in policy . 
This is what has happened in Italy , and it may well occur in the Czech Republic . 
In Latin American countries , on the other hand , an all-or-nothing attitude seems to prevail , with 50.1 % of the popular vote regarded as being sufficient to stage a revolution of sentiment , if not of policy . 
What does this do to the legitimacy of governments , and of political institutions in general ? 
As long as winners with razor-thin majorities , once in office , steer a middle course , they are more likely to remain acceptable to an electorate that is more volatile than divided . 
By contrast , grand coalitions are , in the long term , likely to raise doubts about the system and encourage radical groups . 
The same may also be true if narrow winners adopt a radical agenda , as some think George W. Bush has done in America and many feared Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador would do in Mexico . 
Yet , as long as such leaders respect the democratic constitution , they are not likely to get very far ; the next election will dislodge them . 
Playing divisive games with an electorate that is not deeply divided never succeeds for long . 
The real question is whether an uncertain electorate is prepared to defend democratic constitutions if an extremist who wins by a hair tries to overturn it and usher in a new era of tyranny . 
There is currently no such risk in Europe . 
However reluctantly , Silvio Berlusconi accepted in the end that he had lost , if just by a whisker , as did Viktor Orban in Hungary . 
But one conclusion is perhaps more compelling than ever . 
Britain &apos;s last election also produced a narrow outcome . 
However , seats in parliament , not percentages of the vote are what matters , owing to Britain &apos;s winner-take-all electoral system based on single-member constituencies , which encourages political parties to gravitate to the center . 
A volatile electorate can replace last time &apos;s winner , but both can try to persuade voters and govern without having to go to extremes to gain a majority . 
The first-past-the-post system is still the most effective method of ensuring orderly change .
