South Africa &apos;s Winnable AIDS Battle 
ERFURT - In the battle against HIV / AIDS , South Africa was for many years the perfect example of what not to do . 
Until recently , the government &apos;s response to the epidemic , which threatened the country &apos;s very lifeblood , was lackluster and foolish . 
But rising pressure over the past two decades - from civil-society groups , the media , and more enlightened politicians - is finally showing results . 
A disease that has inflicted profound social and economic pain , and dramatically reduced life expectancy , appears to be in retreat . 
But a new UN report suggests that South Africa &apos;s battle against the virus is far from over . 
The country has the world &apos;s most severe HIV problem , with some 5.6 million citizens - more than 10 % of the population - currently living with the virus . 
Every year , around 300,000 new infections , and 270,000 AIDS-related deaths , are recorded . 
HIV / AIDS patients are also prone to other infections : an estimated 70 % of South Africans with AIDS also contract tuberculosis , while half of those carrying the HIV virus are expected to do so during their lifetime . 
Worse , a third of pregnant women - a highly AIDS-prone demographic - have been diagnosed with the virus , which can be passed on to their babies during childbirth . 
The ferociousness of the disease , and the speed at which it spread , took many South Africans by surprise . 
As in developed countries , HIV infections initially were concentrated among hemophiliacs , sexually active gay men , and intravenous drug users . 
But , during the 1990 &quot; s , and for reasons that are still not fully understood , the virus exploded into the general population . 
The number of infected South Africans ( equivalent to the population of Denmark ) outstrips that of neighboring Mozambique , Lesotho , Botswana , Namibia , Swaziland , and Zimbabwe combined . 
Yet , incredibly , the rapid spread of HIV and the rising toll of AIDS-related deaths failed to galvanize the country &apos;s post-apartheid leaders , especially former President Thabo Mbeki , into meaningful action . 
For years , the top ranks of the governing Africa National Congress seemed to be in denial over the pervasiveness of HIV / AIDS and how best to combat it . 
Civil-society organizations were not so complacent , using the courts , the media , and civil disobedience to lobby for change . 
Although contradictory views about how to treat HIV persisted , at least antiretroviral therapy has been available in some public facilities over the past decade . 
But a more coherent and consistent approach evolved following the appointment of Aaron Motsoaledi as Minister of Health in 2009 . 
The South African National Department of Health and private health-care providers now report that conditions are no longer so desperate . 
Three approaches have helped to contain the spread : the provision of antiretroviral therapy by the government and donor agencies ; better treatment of tuberculosis patients , who tend to contract HIV / AIDS as well ; and a greatly expanded program to prevent mother-to-child transmission . 
These remedies have reduced the rate of new infections ( though the total number of people living with HIV , especially aged 15-49 , continues to rise ) . 
With almost two million patients now on antiretroviral treatment , annual AIDS-related deaths have fallen by around 100,000 since 2005 . 
Contagion among newborn babies , once running at around 70,000 per year , have been cut by some 63 % , and the lives of millions of HIV / AIDS sufferers have been prolonged . 
Another important factor has been better integration of treatment plans . 
The government has aligned its early antiretroviral treatment programs for existing sufferers , initiated in 2008 , with early monitoring programs for pregnant women . 
New , more effective treatment to prevent tuberculosis , especially the multidrug-resistant strains , has also helped . 
More can and must be done . 
Newborn infections , for example , could be further reduced by encouraging more pregnant mothers to visit health clinics for early monitoring and for checkups after delivery . 
But progress to date should be acknowledged , if not celebrated . 
The recent successes demonstrate that with political will and sufficient resources , even the greatest of scourges can be beaten - a lesson not only for South Africa but also for countries elsewhere in Africa and the developing world .
