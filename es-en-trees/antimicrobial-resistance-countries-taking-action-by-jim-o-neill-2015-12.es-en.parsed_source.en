Antimicrobial Resistance on the Global Agenda 
LONDON - November marked a setback in the fight against drug-resistant infections . 
Scientists announced that they had found bacteria that were resistant to colistin , known as an antibiotic of last resort . 
Even more alarming , they discovered that the gene providing the resistance could migrate from one strain of bacteria to another , meaning other types of infections could also become untreatable . 
The announcement prompted public health experts to renew their warnings that the world risks slipping into a deadly , post-antibiotic era . 
But November also brought some good news - even if it received less notice . 
When the G-20 met in Antalya , the leaders of the world &apos;s largest economies agreed that antimicrobial resistance was a threat to global growth . 
Buried in the last paragraph of the communiqué issued at the conclusion of the summit was an agreement to put the issue on the agenda of the organization &apos;s next meeting . 
&quot; We agree that attention should be given to global health risks , such as antimicrobial resistance , infectious disease threats , and weak health systems , &quot; read the communiqué . 
&quot; These can significantly impact growth and stability . &quot; 
This is an important development . 
The G-20 would be an ideal forum in which to take international action against antimicrobial resistance . 
The countries most at risk from the problem include Brazil , Russia , India , and China ( the BRICs ) , none of which is a G-7 member . 
These countries are also among those most likely to find solutions to the challenge . 
Furthermore , the attendees at the G-20 &quot; s summits include heads of state and economic ministers , without whom no solution can be implemented . 
The commitment by the G-20 is just one example of the momentum gathering around the issue . 
In October , G-7 health ministers committed their countries to help combat antimicrobial resistance . 
The problem was also discussed by British Prime Minister David Cameron , Chancellor George Osborne , and their counterparts from India , China , and Brazil . 
A number of leaders , including Cameron , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , US President Barack Obama , and , most recently , Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , have made personal commitments to address the issue . 
Growing recognition of the gravity of the threat is an opportunity that must not be lost . 
Part of the war has already been won . 
We know what must be done to address the challenge , and much is already being accomplished . 
More people are being encouraged to wash their hands to minimize the spread of infections . 
Major campaigns are underway to alert people to the risk that antimicrobial resistance poses to their health and wealth . 
And we are improving the surveillance of superbugs , as we learn more about the dangers they pose to humans and animals . 
The United Kingdom , for example , has committed $ 300 million to support microbiology surveillance capacity in developing countries . 
Specific steps have also been proposed to speed up the adoption of state-of-the-art diagnostics in hospitals , clinics , pharmacies , and homes , so that the unnecessary use of antibiotics can be reduced . 
And we have also begun to combat the misuse of antibiotics in agriculture . 
Indeed , there are encouraging signs that leading US-based food manufacturers are changing their operations in response to consumer pressure . 
This could be the start of a big shift . 
Meanwhile , pharmaceutical companies and government agencies are gaining a better understanding of the role that vaccines and alternative therapies could play in reducing anti-microbial resistance . 
And we are starting to prioritize the development of new drugs - as well as redoubling efforts to extend the lifespans of existing treatments . 
In October , the UK and China agreed to establish a global research and development fund , with the aim of attracting £ 1 billion ( $ 1.5 billion ) in investment in research to reduce the spread of antimicrobial resistance . 
The biggest question that remains to be addressed is how to divide the cost among governments , the pharmaceutical industry , health systems , development agencies , and large charitable foundations . 
This is where the focus of the discussion needs to be now . 
Fortunately , tackling the problem need not break the bank . 
Ensuring that future generations have access to effective antimicrobial treatments will cost little compared to other global challenges . 
We estimate that market-entry rewards for about 15 new drugs would cost $ 16-35 billion over ten years . 
This is a small price to pay relative to the estimated $ 100 trillion in lost global economic output if we do not act . 
Finding about $ 2 billion a year over ten years to stop the return of infectious diseases is well within the means of the world &apos;s 20 richest countries or 20 of its largest pharmaceutical companies . 
If they joined forces to fund a solution , the cost would be a rounding error in their bottom lines . 
But , given the size of the returns , it would be one of the wisest investments that they - or anyone - could make .
