The March of Scientific Folly 
Scientists take enormous pride in their avowals of intellectual impartiality . 
They profess such sobriety of view as to regard all concepts as equal in weight or significance until new evidence decrees otherwise . 
The irony of scientists accepting this belief about themselves at face value is that , among the innumerable kinds of human errors , bias is a relentless nemesis to which scientists are as likely to succumb as anyone else . 
Given a problem , scientists are quick to urge the solution that either promotes - or appears to be demanded by - their most cherished ideas . 
Like many ordinary people , they firmly believe that &quot; in the last analysis , &quot; the mechanisms explained by their pet theories will prove to be most decisive and relevant . 
Recall the exaggerated influence vouchsafed , not too long ago , to psychoanalytic theory . 
Sigmund Freud taught that no act of daily life is ever trivial or meaningless . 
Hence , theoretical schemes were extended beyond reason . 
Roger Caillois ( 1913-1978 ) ironically mocked such thinking : If I forget my umbrella at X &apos;s house , it is because I feel a subconscious sympathy for X. My lapse was only apparent . 
It was , &quot; in reality , &quot; a pretext to return to see X , and thereby to reward my secret affection . 
What if I had left my umbrella at Y &apos;s , whom I cordially detest ? 
In that case , my slip was a desire for self-punishment . 
I atone for experiencing this antipathy , or for wishing Y &apos;s disappearance . 
But what if I forget my umbrella at Z &apos;s house ? 
Toward Z , I am indifferent , neither friend nor foe . 
Here , the psychoanalyst resorts to theory , and tells me that I am mistaken . 
I only think that I am indifferent ; &quot; in reality &quot; I either love or hate , and with uncommon vehemence to boot . 
The proof ? 
Why , the proof is that I forgot the umbrella ! 
Thus , the circle is closed . 
In this system , nothing escapes definitive interpretation . 
Caillois may have been using irony , but his point was well taken . 
Psychoanalysis grew into a formidable , intimidating logic . 
In the above example , absent-mindedness is first a symptom of a subconscious feeling . 
Then , the latter becomes what the ancients called the petitio principii ; we name it begging the question . 
Whether the umbrella is forgotten at home or elsewhere no longer matters . 
Whether there is an apparent reason - or none at all - is irrelevant : psychoanalysis can always supply an explanation . 
Nothing , indeed , resisted the psychoanalytic exegesis . 
Politics , sociology , history , or medicine : all were grist for the psychoanalyst &apos;s mill . 
So agrarian communism was viewed - wait for it - as a return to the maternal womb . 
The capitalist economy was linked to a sado-masochistic anal complex . 
The communist slogan &quot; Proletarians of the world , unite ! &quot; was interpreted by some as a sublimated expression of homosexuality . 
In Soviet Russia , Marxism-Leninism incurred comparable excess . 
Everything had to do with the class struggle . 
To believe Marxist theoreticians , even romantic love between a man and a woman could be explained as a desire of possession and domination , an attitude that mirrored the oppression of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat . 
Biology was no exception . 
Biological facts were seen through the light of ideological bias . 
Alas , when orthodox genetics was discarded in favor of the ruling ideological doctrines , as was done by Stalin &apos;s favorite Trofim Lysenko ( 1898-1976 ) , the results were disastrous . 
Soviet science was set back fifty years . 
In the West , Charles Darwin &apos;s theories suffered no less egregious distortions at the hands of supposed Darwinian acolytes . 
It is now a commonplace that evolutionary theory was used to justify capitalist injustice . 
Illegality and wrongdoing were artfully cloaked as an incontrovertible , science-tested natural law , &quot; the survival of the fittest . &quot; 
Every time a new , powerful scientific formulation appears , it must go through a period of abusive application . 
Today , it is the turn of molecular genetics . 
Temperament , obesity , heart disease , intelligence , homosexuality or criminal behavior : everything is said to reside in the genes . 
Distinguished scientists proclaim that our very destiny is inscribed on the DNA molecule , and science-popularizers join the exultant choir , asserting that human beings are nothing but &quot; programmed &quot; entities . 
The genome contains the complete set of instructions , and is therefore named The Holy Grail , The Bible , The Book of Man . 
When thoroughly deciphered , it is said , the essence of human nature will be fully understood . 
Against these claims , a healthy humanism imposes limits . 
No science can completely explicate human nature : all the sciences , even the most exact , are partial endeavors . 
In other words , a man or a woman is more than his or her psyche ; more than his or her biochemistry ; and more than his or her social identity . 
Assuredly , Man is more than his genes . 
He is also his past , his present and his future . 
Indeed , Man is more than himself , because the specifically human qualities can only be fully deployed in society . 
A person reared in utter isolation ( or by animals , as the semi-legendary &quot; feral children &quot; adopted by wolves ) can never attain full humanity . 
Thus , the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset ( 1883-1955 ) could truthfully state that &quot; the I of Man is immersed precisely in what is not himself , in the pure other that is his circumstance . &quot; 
In the measure that scientists , absorbed in their research and fascinated by technology , forget this profound teaching of the humanities , they will continue to fall prey to Bias , their implacable nemesis .
