Gene Pool Rules 
CLEVELAND - For thousands of years , humans have used genetic engineering to control the evolution of plants and animals . 
So it is inevitable that we will use it to shape our own evolution . 
Our efforts so far have been modest : online dating services are beginning to match subscribers on the basis of their genetic compatibility ; parents increasingly screen embryos and fetuses , allowing only those with the healthiest genes to be born ; geneticists are only slowly improving their ability to manipulate DNA directly ; and no one is trying to make germline changes in humans that will be passed on to succeeding generations . 
Full-scale human evolutionary engineering is still far off , but , at some point in the future , it may well become routine . 
The challenge for humanity is twofold : to survive long enough to reach that point , and to cause the least amount of harm while getting there . 
Those most immediately at risk are children , who are in danger of having their genetic material manipulated in damaging ways . 
The harm can be physical ( stillbirths , deformities , and genetic disorders ) ; but , even genetic engineering that is technically successful can cause psychosocial harm to children , who may be shunned by peers for being odd-looking or merely &quot; different . &quot; 
On a societal level , genetic engineering that only the wealthy can afford would threaten social cohesion by ruling out equality of opportunity . 
Genetic haves and have-nots could form separate castes , with reproductive isolation possibly producing physical changes that would make inter-caste procreation impossible . 
Ultimately , this could lead to the emergence of distinct human species . 
Given that no human species other than our own survives ( Homo floresiensis disappeared about 18,000 years ago ) , the prospects for harmonious coexistence among future human species are not reassuring . 
In the worst case , the human genetic lineage itself could be wiped out by inter-species conflict . 
Even without speciation , the same outcome could occur through a loss of genetic diversity : If everyone selected the same traits for their offspring , their descendants would be incapable of surviving a sudden , unexpected environmental challenge . 
Geneticists often express skepticism about such predictions . 
For example , a reviewer of my recent book , writing in Science , pointed out how little impact &quot; a few genetically engineered individuals &quot; will have on the human gene pool . 
But , while it is true that a genetic-engineering catastrophe will not overtake the entire human species anytime soon , existing genetic-engineering technologies already can harm individual children : witness the increase in premature births and low birth weights associated with in vitro fertilization . 
And reproductive decisions that reflect a cultural preference for boys are beginning to produce social problems in countries like China and India . 
Simply put , in the absence of unknown and unforeseeable technical impediments , human evolutionary engineering is likely to become sufficiently widespread in the future to pose species-wide threats . 
So , while it may not be necessary to employ measures now to prevent harm in the future , it makes sense to identify which measures might be needed , together with the changes in social norms and behaviors that might be required to implement them . 
Many of the risks from evolutionary engineering are triggered by bad parental decision-making . 
Eager to give their children social advantages , parents may make reproductive decisions based on faulty or incomplete genetic information , or seek genetic alteration of their offspring before adequate safety testing has been carried out . 
Determining when it is permissible to interfere with parental choices is challenging , given the deference that parents typically receive . 
Most countries have laws aimed at protecting children from abuse and neglect . 
Most of the reproductive decisions parents make cannot be carried out without the aid of professionals such as physicians , so it might be necessary to regulate professional behavior as well . 
While some of the infrastructure , such as licensure laws for physicians , is already in place , additional steps may be needed , such as heightened regulation of infertility clinics , where many genetic-engineering interventions will take place . 
Furthermore , rules must be established for assessing the safety and effectiveness of new technologies with respect both to immediate recipients and their descendants . 
Some forms of evolutionary engineering that do not directly harm individuals , and therefore would not be subject to such regulations , such as decisions by all parents to make the same genetic changes in their offspring , could threaten the survival of the human lineage . 
Public-health systems could respond to this concern . 
Finally , if too few members of society enjoy too great a genetic advantage , social cohesion and democratic institutions could be threatened even in the absence of any direct physical harm . 
If the genetic engineering that we allow is to benefit our descendants , it must be as widely available as possible .
