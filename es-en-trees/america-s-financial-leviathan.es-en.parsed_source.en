America &apos;s Financial Leviathan 
BERKELEY - In 1950 , finance and insurance in the United States accounted for 2.8 % of GDP , according to US Department of Commerce estimates . 
By 1960 , that share had grown to 3.8 % of GDP , and reached 6 % of GDP in 1990 . 
Today , it is 8.4 % of GDP , and it is not shrinking . 
The Wall Street Journal &apos;s Justin Lahart reports that the 2010 share was higher than the previous peak share in 2006 . 
Lahart goes on to say that growth in the finance-and-insurance share of the economy has &quot; not , by and large , been a bad thing .... Deploying capital to the places where it can be best used helps the economy grow ... &quot; 
But if the US were getting good value from the extra 5.6 % of GDP that it is now spending on finance and insurance - the extra $ 750 billion diverted annually from paying people who make directly useful goods and provide directly useful services - it would be obvious in the statistics . 
At a typical 5 % annual real interest rate for risky cash flows , diverting that large a share of resources away from goods and services directly useful this year is a good bargain only if it boosts overall annual economic growth by 0.3 % - or 6 % per 25-year generation . 
There have been many shocks to the US economy over the past couple of generations , and many factors have added to or subtracted from economic growth . 
But it is not obvious that the US economy today would be 6 % less productive if it had had the finance-insurance system of 1950 rather than the one that prevailed during the past 20 years . 
There are five ways that an economy gains from a well-functioning finance-insurance system . 
First , people are no longer as vulnerable to the effects of fires , floods , medical disasters , unemployment , business collapses , sectoral shifts , and so forth , because a well-working finance-insurance system diversifies and thus dissipates some risks , and deals with others by matching those who fear risk with those who can comfortably bear it . 
While it might be true that America &apos;s current finance-insurance system better distributes risk in some sense , it is hard to see how that could be the case , given the experience of investors in equities and housing over the past two decades . 
Second , well-functioning financial systems match large , illiquid investment projects with the relatively small pools of money contributed by individual savers who value liquidity highly . 
There has been one important innovation over the past two generations : businesses can now issue high-yield bonds . 
But , given the costs of the bankruptcy process , it has never been clear why a business would rather issue high-yield bonds ( besides gaming the tax system ) , or why investors would rather buy them than take an equity stake . 
Third , improved opportunities to borrow allow one to spend more now , when one is poor , and save more later , when one is rich . 
Households are certainly much more able to borrow , thanks to home-equity loans , credit-card balances , and payday loans . 
But what are they really buying ? 
Many are not buying the ability to spend when they are poor and save when they are rich , but instead appear to be buying postponement of the &quot; unpleasant financial retrenchment &quot; talk with the other members of their household . 
And that is not something you want to buy . 
Fourth , we have seen major improvements in the ease of transactions . 
But , while electronic transactions have made a great deal of financial life much easier , this should have been accompanied by a decrease , not an increase , in the finance share of GDP , just as automated switching in telecommunications led to a decrease in the number of telephone switchboard operators per phone call . 
Indeed , the operations of those parts of the financial system most closely related to technological improvements have slimmed down markedly : consider what has happened to the checking operations of the regional Federal Reserve Banks . 
Finally , better finance should mean better corporate governance . 
Since shareholder democracy does not provide effective control over entrenched , runaway , self-indulgent management , finance has a potentially powerful role to play in ensuring that corporate managers work in the interest of shareholders . 
And a substantial change has indeed occurred over the past two generations : CEOs focus much more attention than they used to on pleasing the stock market , and this is likely to be a good thing . 
Overall , however , it remains disturbing that we do not see the obvious large benefits , at either the micro or macro level , in the US economy &apos;s efficiency that would justify spending an extra 5.6 % of GDP every year on finance and insurance . 
Lahart cites the conclusion of New York University &apos;s Thomas Philippon that today &apos;s US financial sector is outsized by two percentage points of GDP . 
And it is very possible that Philippon &apos;s estimate of the size of the US financial sector &apos;s hypertrophy is too small . 
Why has the devotion of a great deal of skill and enterprise to finance and insurance sector not paid obvious economic dividends ? 
There are two sustainable ways to make money in finance : find people with risks that need to be carried and match them with people with unused risk-bearing capacity , or find people with such risks and match them with people who are clueless but who have money . 
Are we sure that most of the growth in finance stems from a rising share of financial professionals who undertake the former rather than the latter ?
