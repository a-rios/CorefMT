China &apos;s Wake-Up Call from Washington 
NEW HAVEN - Yes , the United States dodged another bullet with a last-minute deal on the debt ceiling . 
But , with 90 days left to bridge the ideological and partisan divide before another crisis erupts , the fuse on America &apos;s debt bomb is getting shorter and shorter . 
As a dysfunctional US government peers into the abyss , China - America &apos;s largest foreign creditor - has much at stake . 
It began so innocently . 
As recently as 2000 , China owned only about $ 60 billion in US Treasuries , or roughly 2 % of the outstanding US debt of $ 3.3 trillion held by the public . 
But then both countries upped the ante on America &apos;s fiscal profligacy . 
US debt exploded to nearly $ 12 trillion ( $ 16.7 trillion if intragovernmental holdings are included ) . 
And China &apos;s share of America &apos;s publicly-held debt overhang increased more than five-fold , to nearly 11 % ( $ 1.3 trillion ) by July 2013 . 
Along with roughly $ 700 billion in Chinese holdings of US agency debt ( Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ) , China &apos;s total $ 2 trillion exposure to US government and quasi-government securities is massive by any standard . 
China &apos;s seemingly open-ended purchases of US government debt are at the heart of a web of codependency that binds the two economies . 
China does not buy Treasuries out of benevolence , or because it looks to America as a shining example of wealth and prosperity . 
It certainly is not attracted by the return and seemingly riskless security of US government paper - both of which are much in play in an era of zero interest rates and mounting concerns about default . 
Nor is sympathy at work ; 
China does not buy Treasuries because it wants to temper the pain of America &apos;s fiscal brinkmanship . 
China buys Treasuries because they suit its currency policy and the export-led growth that it has relied on over the past 33 years . 
As a surplus saver , China has run large current-account surpluses since 1994 , accumulating a massive portfolio of foreign-exchange reserves that now stands at almost $ 3.7 trillion . 
China has recycled about 60 % of these reserves back into dollar-denominated US government securities , because it wants to limit any appreciation of the renminbi against the world &apos;s benchmark currency . 
If China bought fewer dollars , the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate - up 35 % against the dollar since mid-2005 - would strengthen more sharply than it already has , jeopardizing competiveness and export-led growth . 
This arrangement fits America &apos;s needs like a glove . 
Given its extraordinary shortfall of domestic saving , the US runs chronic current-account deficits and relies on foreign investors to fill the funding void . 
US politicians take this for granted as a special privilege bestowed by the dollar &apos;s position as the world &apos;s major reserve currency . 
When queried about America &apos;s dependence on foreign lenders , they often smugly retort , &quot; Where else would they go ? &quot; 
I have heard that line many times when I have testified before the US Congress . 
Of course , America benefits from China &apos;s outward-facing growth model in many other ways , as well . 
China &apos;s purchases of Treasuries help hold down US interest rates - possibly by as much as one percentage point - which provides broad support to other asset markets , such as equities and real estate , whose valuation depends to some extent on Chinese-subsidized US interest rates . 
And , of course , hard-pressed middle-class American consumers benefit hugely from low-cost Chinese imports - the Walmart effect - that enable them to stretch their budgets in an era of unrelenting pressure on jobs and real incomes . 
For more than 20 years , this mutually beneficial codependency has served both countries well in compensating for their inherent saving imbalances while satisfying their respective growth agendas . 
But here the past should not be viewed as prologue . 
A seismic shift is at hand , and America &apos;s recent fiscal follies may well be the tipping point . 
China has made a conscious strategic decision to alter its growth strategy . 
Its 12th Five-Year Plan , enacted in March 2011 , lays out a broad framework for a more balanced growth model that relies increasingly on domestic private consumption . 
These plans are about to be put into action . 
An important meeting in November - the Third Plenum of the Central Committee of the 18th Chinese Communist Party Congress - will provide a major test of the new leadership team &apos;s commitment to a detailed agenda of reforms and policies that will be required to achieve this shift . 
The debt-ceiling debacle has sent a clear message to China - and comes in conjunction with other warning signs . 
Post-crisis sluggishness in US aggregate demand - especially consumer demand - is likely to persist , denying Chinese exporters the support they need from their largest foreign market . 
US-led China bashing - a bipartisan blame game that reached new heights in the 2012 political cycle - remains a real threat . 
And now the safety and security of US debt are at risk . 
Economic alarms rarely ring so loudly . 
The time has come for China to respond with equal clarity . 
Rebalancing is China &apos;s only option . 
Several internal factors - excess resource consumption , environmental degradation , and mounting income inequalities - are calling the old model into question , while a broad constellation of US-centric external forces also attests to the urgent need for realignment . 
With rebalancing will come a decline in China &apos;s surplus saving , much slower accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves , and a concomitant reduction in its seemingly voracious demand for dollar-denominated assets . 
Curtailing purchases of US Treasuries is a perfectly logical outgrowth of this process . 
Long dependent on China to finesse its fiscal problems , America may now have to pay a much steeper price to secure external capital . 
Recently , Chinese commentators have provocatively referred to the inevitability of a &quot; de-Americanized world . &quot; 
For China , this is not a power race . 
It should be seen as more of a conscious strategy to do what is right for China as it confronts its own daunting growth and development imperatives in the coming years . 
The US will find it equally urgent to come to grips with a very different China . 
Codependency was never a sustainable strategy for either side . 
China just happens to have understood this first . 
The days of its open-ended buying of Treasuries will soon come to an end .
