Syria &apos;s Balkan Tragedy 
BERLIN - Pacifist doctrines may say otherwise , but combining diplomacy with the threat of military force is a highly effective tactic , as we have just seen in Syria . 
It was the credibility of the United States &quot; threat of military intervention that seems to have led Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to cut a deal brokered by his main allies , Russia and , less directly , Iran . 
Assad now appears prepared to give up his chemical weapons in exchange for remaining in power . 
But what will happen to America &apos;s credibility , and that of the West , if the agreement falls apart ? 
The deal struck by the US and Russia triggered widespread relief in most Western capitals , where political leaders simply are not prepared for military intervention , even if Syria &apos;s government is killing its own people with poison gas ( on this score , the agreement amounts to a confession by Assad ) . 
After a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq , the West would rather stay at home ; neither the US nor the United Kingdom - nor most other NATO members - wants to become entangled in another Middle East conflict that cannot be won . 
Indeed , there are only bad options for the US in Syria . 
Military intervention has no visible end point and would only increase chaos . 
But staying out will produce nearly the same result and dramatically shake America &apos;s credibility in a crisis-ridden region , with serious consequences for the future . 
Furthermore , deployment of chemical weapons invites escalation . 
Most people in the West regard Syria &apos;s civil war as a continuation of the sectarian violence in Iraq . 
But Syria is not Iraq . 
America &apos;s president is not searching for excuses to start a war ; 
The scale of the violence in Syria underscores the risk implied by inaction . 
Of course , there is no denying the dangers associated with a military intervention : regional expansion of the conflict , the deaths of many more innocent people , and the strengthening of extremist forces among the rebels , to name only a few . 
But all of this has been happening already , and it will continue to happen , especially without American military intervention . 
The civil war will escalate further , because it is part of a larger contest for supremacy between Iran and its Shia allies and Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and the other Sunni countries . 
If the US had not responded to the Assad regime &apos;s use of chemical weapons , the entire world would have asked what a US guarantee is worth if an American president &apos;s &quot; red line &quot; is crossed without consequences . 
In Jerusalem , Tehran , and other Middle East capitals , as well as on the Korean Peninsula and in other global hotspots , the consequences would be ( and probably already are ) dire . 
From the outset of the Syrian conflict , the US and its European allies have lacked a strategy . 
Is their goal to end the civil war or bring about regime change ? 
And who or what should take Assad &apos;s place ? 
Or does the West aspire to reach a compromise with Russia and Iran that would leave Assad &apos;s regime in place ? 
The latter goal would shift the axis of US policy in the Middle East , with far-reaching strategic consequences , because such a compromise could only be reached at the expense of America &apos;s Sunni allies . 
Even if Russia and Iran are pursuing separate agendas in supporting Assad , both countries &quot; interests are inextricably connected to the continuation of the regime , not necessarily to Assad &apos;s political survival . 
For Russia , regime change in Syria - its last military outpost in the region - would be another bitter defeat ; for Iran , it would mean losing its most important ally in the Arab world , implying even deeper isolation . 
Thus , in contrast to the West &apos;s temporizing , the strategy of Assad &apos;s allies is clearly defined : military victory for the regime , backed by ample supplies of weapons and , in the case of Iran , Lebanese proxy troops from Hezbollah on the ground . 
Obama committed a fateful error when , for domestic political reasons , he decided to ask the US Congress to agree to a limited punitive military strike . 
And , though the Russian diplomatic initiative ( based on a joint proposal with Iran ) averted this disaster , everything has its price . 
That price is not necessarily a gain in prestige for the Kremlin . 
The true risk implied by the US deal with Russia lies elsewhere . 
It was not weakness or helplessness that induced Obama to play for high stakes . 
If he succeeds - Syria &apos;s chemical weapons are destroyed , a peace conference ends the civil war , a transitional government takes power , and the US and Iran launch direct negotiations about Iran &apos;s nuclear program and regional stability in the Middle East - he will truly deserve his Nobel Peace Prize . 
If Obama fails , however , Syria will not be a second Iraq , but more likely a repetition of the Bosnian calamity . 
For years , the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina escalated , alongside a &quot; diplomatic process &quot; marked by a series of broken promises , culminating in the massacre at Srebrenica of thousands of civilians supposedly under United Nations protection . 
In the end , intervention was necessary anyway . 
Are the US and its European allies prepared for a scenario in which the agreement with Russia breaks down and Syria &apos;s chemical weapons are not destroyed under international control ? 
This is the decisive moral and political question for the West . 
If and when the time comes , it had better have an answer .
