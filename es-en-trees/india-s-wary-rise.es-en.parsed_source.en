India &apos;s Wary Rise 
PARIS - Some countries are naturally at ease with the concept and the reality of strategic power . 
Such was clearly the case of France under Louis XIV , the Sun King in the seventeenth century , and such is the case today of China , whose leadership is comfortable with the balance-of-power games of classical Europe . 
India is clearly in a different category . 
In economic terms , India &apos;s confidence has been boosted by the way the Western world now looks at it with a mixture of respect and greed : &quot; What kind of deals can I strike with such an emerging market , whose population will soon be the largest of any country in the world ? &quot; 
Yet , in order to understand India &apos;s political and diplomatic relationship with the outside world , the most enlightening comparison is with America in 1920 . 
Like the United States after World War I , India is realizing that its status and role in the world have been deeply transformed in the last two decades . 
And , like America then , India is not naturally at ease with the notion of exercising global power . 
India &apos;s history and culture , from Asoka , its mythical emperor in the third century BC , to Gandhi , push it to emphasize ethics and to consider itself an &quot; exceptional &quot; nation in its relationship with the world . 
Contrary to China , India finds it difficult to adapt to its status as an emerging &quot; Great Power . &quot; 
It would be a gross exaggeration , of course , to speak of an Indian &quot; inferiority complex . &quot; 
And yet India constantly measures itself against China , remains obsessed with Pakistan , and has recently begun to look more critically at its relationship with the US . 
It is natural for India to proclaim its &quot; democratic &quot; superiority to China while recognizing that on all strategic fronts it is not in the same league . 
But is it even possible to draw a comparison between what one Indian academic has called the &quot; robotized Chinese man &quot; and the vast human diversity of India ? 
India seems to worry more than ever about China &apos;s evolution . 
China &apos;s key role within the G-20 , together with the relative if not absolute decline of the Western powers , seems to have reinforced the hard-liners in Beijing and the nationalism of a China that seems less ready than ever to accept any criticism of its human rights record . 
Viewed from New Delhi , the vision of a reasonable , prudent , and ultimately satisfied China - a vision &quot; sold &quot; to the world by the Minister Mentor of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew - appears less than obvious . 
When it comes to Pakistan , too , India seems to lack confidence . 
On all fronts - demographic , economic , military , and political - India is far above Pakistan . 
But India does not seem to know how to deal with its northwestern neighbor , and even less whom to deal with in its government . 
The largest democracy in the world cannot say openly that it almost preferred the military dictatorship of General Pervez Musharraf to the chaos of the current situation . 
In reality , what prevails in India is a deep sense of frustration with Pakistan . 
India &apos;s overtures to Pakistan &apos;s government have largely remained unanswered , and when Indian officials express their unease , the US , if not the international community , accuses them of behaving irresponsibly . 
If India seems not to believe that America and its allies can really &quot; succeed &quot; in Afghanistan , nor is it willing to resign itself to a return of the Taliban to power , which could in turn lead to Talibanization of Pakistan . 
Yet India seems to behave in a very &quot; European &quot; way in Afghanistan ; it is ready to send money and experts , but not troops . 
India &apos;s worries and frustrations in Afghanistan and Pakistan translate into a mixture of disillusion and irritation with an America that , seen from New Delhi , allows itself to be manipulated by Pakistani officials . 
Indians cannot quite decide whether the Americans are simply &quot; naive &quot; or duplicitous ; either way , they are not reassured . 
Whatever the case , the current warming of relations between India and Russia , symbolized by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin &apos;s recent visit , does not translate into a grand reversal of alliances , as India &apos;s break with Russia in the 1990 &quot; s did . 
India &apos;s exchanges with Russia are only one-fifth of what they are with China . 
What prevails nowadays in New Delhi and Moscow is simple pragmatism . 
While there is room for Europe in India &apos;s view of the world , for India ( as for China ) Europe is above all an economic rather than a political reality . 
When it comes to politics , bilateral relations prevail , and from that standpoint France and Germany seem more important than Great Britain . 
The Raj era may be visible in the buildings of New Delhi and in the uniforms of the Indian army , but Britain has lost any competitive edge that it once had in India . 
The past is truly passed . 
India &apos;s unease about strategic power , and its resemblance to a gigantic European Union united only by the English language , reflects its ongoing search for a new international identity . 
In this quest , India is impaired by its lack of practice in the exercise of power on a grand scale . 
India is not about to become a second China - it lacks both the means and the ambition . 
That is a further reason for the West to engage and invest in India .
