The Global Economy &apos;s Groundhog Day 
NEW DELHI - In the movie &quot; Groundhog Day , &quot; a television weatherman , played by Bill Murray , awakes every morning at 6 : 00 to relive the same day . 
A similar sense of déjà vu has pervaded economic forecasting since the global economic crisis began a half-decade ago . 
Yet policymakers remain convinced that the economic-growth model that prevailed during the pre-crisis years is still their best guide , at least in the near future . 
Consider the mid-year update of the International Monetary Fund &apos;s World Economic Outlook , which has told the same story every year since 2011 : &quot; Oops ! 
The world economy did not perform as well as we expected . &quot; 
The reports go on to blame unanticipated factors - such as the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan , uncertainty about America &apos;s exit from expansionary monetary policy , a &quot; one-time &quot; re-pricing of risk , and severe weather in the United States - for the inaccuracies . 
Emphasizing the temporary nature of these factors , the reports insist that , though world GDP growth amounted to roughly 3 % during the first half of the year , it will pick up in the second half . 
Driven by this new momentum , growth will finally reach the long-elusive 4 % rate next year . 
When it does not , the IMF publishes another rendition of the same claims . 
This serial misjudgment highlights the need to think differently . 
Perhaps the focus on the disruptions caused by the global financial crisis is obscuring a natural shift in developed economies to a lower gear following years of pumped-up growth . 
Moreover , though emerging economies are also experiencing acute growth slowdowns , their share of the global economic pie will continue to grow . 
In short , tougher economic competition , slower growth , and low inflation may be here to stay . 
In the United States , conditions for an economic takeoff ostensibly have been present for the last year . 
Household debt and unemployment have fallen ; corporate profits and cash reserves are large ; the stock market is valuing the future generously ; banks are ready to lend ; and fiscal consolidation is no longer hampering demand . 
Yet , contrary to expectations , growth in household consumption has remained lackluster , and businesses have not ramped up investment . 
In the first two quarters of this year , America &apos;s GDP barely exceeded the level it attained at the end of last year , and much of the increase was driven by goods that have been produced but not yet sold . 
The prevailing explanation - a brutally cold winter - is wearing so thin that everyone should be able to see through it . 
American consumers remain scarred by the crisis . 
But there is another problem : in their homes and workplaces , the sense of excitement about the future is missing , despite all the gee-whiz gadgetry that now surrounds them . 
And while the US Federal Reserve &apos;s policy of quantitative easing has propped up businesses , it is no substitute for the enthusiasm and anticipation needed to propel investment . 
Even the reduced global forecast of 3.4 % GDP growth for this year is likely to prove excessively optimistic . 
Before the crisis , world trade grew at 6-8 % annually - well faster than GDP . 
But , so far this year , trade growth remains stuck at about 3 % . 
Failure to recognize the fundamental slowdown that is occurring is reinforcing the expectation that old models can revive growth - an approach that will only create new fragilities . 
Atif Mian and Amir Sufi warn that US consumers &quot; purchases of cars and other durables have been bolstered by the same unsustainable &quot; subprime &quot; lending practices that were used to finance home purchases before the crisis . 
Similarly , Mark Carney , Governor of the Bank of England , envisages a Britain with a Cyprus-sized financial sector amounting to 900 % of GDP . 
And economist Michael Pettis cautions that China &apos;s reliance on policy stimulus to kick-start the economy whenever it stalls will merely cause macroeconomic vulnerabilities to accumulate . 
The two tectonic shifts in the global economy - slower GDP growth and increased emerging-market competition - have created a fault line that runs through Europe . 
The technical lead held by Europe &apos;s traditional trading economies is being eroded , while wage competition is encouraging fears of deflation . 
And , with the eurozone &apos;s most debt-burdened economies bearing the brunt of these shifts , Italy is sitting directly atop the fault . 
The European Central Bank , however , is unable to revive eurozone growth on its own . 
Given the resulting drag on the global economy - and especially on world trade - it is in the world &apos;s interest to engineer a coordinated depreciation of the euro . 
At the same time , a globally coordinated investment stimulus is needed to create new opportunities for growth . 
Just as Bill Murray &apos;s character could not escape Groundhog Day without radically changing his life , we cannot expect different economic outcomes without fundamentally different growth models .
