European Social Democracy &apos;s Powerless Power 
At first glance , European social democracy appears to be in crisis . 
Gordon Brown &apos;s slump in the United Kingdom ; the brutal shock of Spain &apos;s economic downturn ; the difficulties of renewing Socialist leadership in France ; the collapse of the center-left coalition in Italy ; and severe infighting within Germany &apos;s SPD : all point to social democracy &apos;s seeming inability to seize the opportunity - which the current financial crisis should present - to exert greater influence . 
But the simultaneous occurrence and high visibility of these problems is less significant than they appear . 
Mistakes or clumsiness in governance are not exclusive to the left : Belgium is paralyzed by the threat of break-up , Austria is still looking to cement an unlikely conservative coalition , Poland is struggling to find a steady balance for its numerous reactionary impulses , and the French president is hitting record lows in terms of popularity . 
First , there is the economic and financial crisis that we are only slowly overcoming . 
The combination of the two is , I believe , behind the feeling of powerlessness that is now affecting the whole of Europe , and that may appear to characterize social democracy in particular . 
In reporting on the crisis , the media have placed too much emphasis on finance alone , and have paid insufficient attention to the marked slowing of economic growth . 
Indeed , the combination of banking uncertainties , slower growth , and the heightened risk of underemployment and casual labor creates the political weakness now visible in the UK , Spain , Italy , and elsewhere . 
Herein lies a real ideological problem . 
The second half of the twentieth century witnessed the victory of the market economy over the administered economy . 
The left , which had previously looked to Marx , lost its bearings . 
Even social democracy , which , particularly in Scandinavia , was an excellent regulator of capitalism , found itself muted in the controversy between Keynesians and monetarists , and , throughout the developed world , the monetarists won . 
Today &apos;s accepted wisdom is that markets are optimally balanced whatever their state , meaning that no government intervention or regulation would be efficient or desirable . 
The current crisis is severe punishment for that immense intellectual error . 
Not only is the decline of previously accepted social and financial regulations reflected in the relative , but important , drop in wage income as a percentage of GDP - and therefore consumer spending - in all developed countries in the last thirty years , but also the deliberate abolition of controls allows the banking sector to do as it pleases . 
Still , to judge from most media coverage , the parallel sub-prime and packaged loan crises , which are paralyzing global finance , are entirely attributable to banks &quot; &quot; immorality , &quot; and are in no way due to systemic failure . 
Simply put , deregulation , privatization , reduced public services , and refocusing corporate management on earnings - all this suits too many people . 
As a result , the political battle to reintroduce a sense of general interest - of rules and balance - will be long and hard . 
What is also clear , even if it is not as well recognized , is that this battle will be primarily intellectual in nature : legitimacy must be given back to the notion of having certain ground rules and public regulatory bodies . 
This should be the task for social democrats - but that is where the shoe pinches . 
We social democrats can no longer fight such battles , because the problem is not only ideological , but also cultural . 
The media are no longer a commentator , but a participant that has hijacked politics with imagery . 
Either by accident or design , the media choose only those battles that offer the finest spectacles : clashes of personalities , violence and repression , struggles over national identity , and disputes about moral and sexual attitudes . 
For the contemporary media , technical controversies about policy hold no interest , because the audience for them is limited . 
For example , in preparation for its next congress , the French Socialist Party has succumbed to this reality . 
We already know that there will be media fireworks , but there will be little talk of economic regulation . 
The case of Spain - where a competent and respected government is bearing the full brunt of a financial crisis that began elsewhere - is identical . 
Instead of focusing on the crisis alone , it is fidgeting in the face of the media . 
Anything that threatens government stability sells newspapers and advertising space , while complicating any resolution of the underlying problems . 
Quite simply , a system in which the media behave this way places not only the economy , but also democracy , at risk .
