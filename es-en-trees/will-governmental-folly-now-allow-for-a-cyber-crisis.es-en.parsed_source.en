Will Governmental Folly Now Allow for a Cyber Crisis ? 
CAMBRIDGE - When the financial crisis of 2008 hit , many shocked critics asked why markets , regulators , and financial experts failed to see it coming . 
Today , one might ask the same question about the global economy &apos;s vulnerability to cyber-attack . 
Indeed , the parallels between financial crises and the threat of cyber meltdowns are striking . 
Although the greatest cyber threat comes from rogue states with the capacity to develop extremely sophisticated computer viruses , risks can also come from anarchistic hackers and terrorists , or even from computer glitches compounded by natural catastrophe . 
A few security experts have voiced great alarm , including , most recently , Jonathan Evans , the head of the British Security Service ( MI5 ) . 
By and large , however , few leaders are willing to compromise growth in the tech sector or the Internet in any significant way in the name of a threat that is so amorphous . 
Instead , they prefer to establish relatively innocuous working groups and task forces . 
It is difficult to overstate the dependence of modern economies on large-scale computer systems . 
But imagine if one day a host of key communications satellites were incapacitated , or the databases of major financial systems were erased . 
Experts have long identified the electricity grid as the most acute vulnerability , since any modern economy would collapse without power . 
True , many skeptics argue that with reasonable low-cost prophylactic measures , large scale cyber-meltdowns are highly implausible , and that doom-mongers overstate the worst-case scenarios . 
They say that the ability of cyber-terrorists and blackmailers to take the global economy to the brink , as in the 2007 Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 4 , is utterly fictional . 
It is difficult to judge who is right , and there are important experts on both sides of the debate . 
But there do seem to be an uncomfortable number of similarities between the political economy of cyberspace regulation and of financial regulation . 
First , both cyber-security and financial stability are extremely complex topics with which government regulators can hardly keep up . 
Industry remuneration for experts is far in excess of any public-sector salary , and the best minds are continually bid away . 
As a result , some argue that the only solution is reliance on self-regulation by the software industry . 
One hears this argument for many modern industries , from big food to big pharma to big finance . 
Second , like the financial sector , the tech industry is enormously influential politically through contributions and lobbying . 
In the United States , all presidential candidates must make pilgrimages to Silicon Valley and other tech centers to raise money . 
Excessive financial-sector influence was , of course , a root cause of the 2008 meltdown and remains deeply implicated in today &apos;s continuing eurozone mess . 
Third , with slowing growth in advanced economies , information technology seems to hold the moral high ground , just as finance did until five years ago . 
And crude attempts by governments to enforce regulation are likely to prove ineffective in protecting against catastrophe , while all too effective in strangling growth . 
In both cases - financial stability and cyber security - the risk of contagion creates a situation in which a wedge can form between private incentives and social risks . 
Admittedly , progress in the technology sector overall often produces huge social-welfare gains , which arguably outstrip those produced by all other sectors in recent decades . 
But , just as with nuclear power plants , progress can go awry in the absence of good regulation . 
Finally , the greatest risks come from arrogance and ignorance , two human characteristics at the heart of most financial crises . 
Recent revelations about the super-viruses &quot; Stuxnet &quot; and &quot; Flame &quot; are particularly disconcerting . 
These viruses , apparently developed by the US and Israel to disrupt Iran &apos;s nuclear program , embody a level of sophistication far beyond anything previously seen . 
Both are deeply encrypted and difficult to detect once inside a computer . 
The Flame virus has the capacity to take over a computer &apos;s peripherals , record Skype conversations , take pictures through a computer &apos;s camera , and transmit information via Bluetooth to any nearby device . 
If the world &apos;s most sophisticated governments are developing computer viruses , what guarantee is there that something won &apos;t go awry ? 
How can we be sure that they won &apos;t &quot; escape &quot; and infect a much broader class of systems , or be adopted for other uses , or that future rogue states or terrorists won &apos;t find a way to turn them on their creators ? 
No economy is more vulnerable than the US , and it is arrogance to believe that US cyber superiority ( to all except perhaps China ) provides it with impenetrable security from attack . 
Unfortunately the solution is not so simple as just building better anti-virus programs . 
Virus protection and virus development constitute an uneven arms race . 
A virus can be just a couple hundred lines of computer code , compared to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti-virus programs , which must be designed to detect wide classes of enemies . 
We are told not to worry about large-scale cyber meltdowns , because none has occurred , and governments are being vigilant . 
Unfortunately , another lesson of the financial crisis is that most politicians are congenitally incapable of making difficult choices until risks actually materialize . 
Let us hope that we are lucky for a while longer .
