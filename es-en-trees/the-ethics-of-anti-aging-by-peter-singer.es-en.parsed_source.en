Should We Live to 1,000 ? 
PRINCETON - On which problems should we focus research in medicine and the biological sciences ? 
There is a strong argument for tackling the diseases that kill the most people -diseases like malaria , measles , and diarrhea , which kill millions in developing countries , but very few in the developed world . 
Developed countries , however , devote most of their research funds to the diseases from which their citizens suffer , and that seems likely to continue for the foreseeable future . 
Given that constraint , which medical breakthrough would do the most to improve our lives ? 
If your first thought is &quot; a cure for cancer &quot; or &quot; a cure for heart disease , &quot; think again . 
Aubrey de Grey , Chief Science Officer of SENS Foundation and the world &apos;s most prominent advocate of anti-aging research , argues that it makes no sense to spend the vast majority of our medical resources on trying to combat the diseases of aging without tackling aging itself . 
If we cure one of these diseases , those who would have died from it can expect to succumb to another in a few years . 
The benefit is therefore modest . 
In developed countries , aging is the ultimate cause of 90 % of all human deaths ; thus , treating aging is a form of preventive medicine for all of the diseases of old age . 
Moreover , even before aging leads to our death , it reduces our capacity to enjoy our own lives and to contribute positively to the lives of others . 
So , instead of targeting specific diseases that are much more likely to occur when people have reached a certain age , wouldn &apos;t a better strategy be to attempt to forestall or repair the damage done to our bodies by the aging process ? 
De Grey believes that even modest progress in this area over the coming decade could lead to a dramatic extension of the human lifespan . 
All we need to do is reach what he calls &quot; longevity escape velocity &quot; - that is , the point at which we can extend life sufficiently to allow time for further scientific progress to permit additional extensions , and thus further progress and greater longevity . 
Speaking recently at Princeton University , de Grey said : &quot; We don &apos;t know how old the first person who will live to 150 is today , but the first person to live to 1,000 is almost certainly less than 20 years younger . &quot; 
What most attracts de Grey about this prospect is not living forever , but rather the extension of healthy , youthful life that would come with a degree of control over the process of aging . 
In developed countries , enabling those who are young or middle-aged to remain youthful longer would attenuate the looming demographic problem of an historically unprecedented proportion of the population reaching advanced age - and often becoming dependent on younger people . 
On the other hand , we still need to pose the ethical question : Are we being selfish in seeking to extend our lives so dramatically ? 
And , if we succeed , will the outcome be good for some but unfair to others ? 
People in rich countries already can expect to live about 30 years longer than people in the poorest countries . 
If we discover how to slow aging , we might have a world in which the poor majority must face death at a time when members of the rich minority are only one-tenth of the way through their expected lifespans . 
That disparity is one reason to believe that overcoming aging will increase the stock of injustice in the world . 
Another is that if people continue to be born , while others do not die , the planet &apos;s population will increase at an even faster rate than it is now , which will likewise make life for some much worse than it would have been otherwise . 
Whether we can overcome these objections depends on our degree of optimism about future technological and economic advances . 
De Grey &apos;s response to the first objection is that , while anti-aging treatment may be expensive initially , the price is likely to drop , as it has for so many other innovations , from computers to the drugs that prevent the development of AIDS . 
If the world can continue to develop economically and technologically , people will become wealthier , and , in the long run , anti-aging treatment will benefit everyone . 
So why not get started and make it a priority now ? 
As for the second objection , contrary to what most people assume , success in overcoming aging could itself give us breathing space to find solutions to the population problem , because it would also delay or eliminate menopause , enabling women to have their first children much later than they can now . 
If economic development continues , fertility rates in developing countries will fall , as they have in developed countries . 
In the end , technology , too , may help to overcome the population objection , by providing new sources of energy that do not increase our carbon footprint . 
The population objection raises a deeper philosophical question . 
If our planet has a finite capacity to support human life , is it better to have fewer people living longer lives , or more people living shorter lives ? 
One reason for thinking it better to have fewer people living longer lives is that only those who are born know what death deprives them of ; those who do not exist cannot know what they are missing . 
De Grey has set up SENS Foundation to promote research into anti-aging . 
By most standards , his fundraising efforts have been successful , for the foundation now has an annual budget of around $ 4 million . 
But that is still pitifully small by the standards of medical research foundations . 
De Grey might be mistaken , but if there is only a small chance that he is right , the huge pay-offs make anti-aging research a better bet than areas of medical research that are currently far better funded .
