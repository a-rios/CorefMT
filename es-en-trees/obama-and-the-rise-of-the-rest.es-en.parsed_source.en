Obama and the Rise of the Rest 
NEW YORK - American elections usually produce a brief euphoria ; the public sense of renewal , of future possibilities , acts as a shot of adrenaline . 
This year , however , the palpable relief and celebration will be tempered by the widely shared sense that all is not well in America . 
The economic data are almost uniformly bleak and will not improve soon , and , while national security issues appear less pressing because of the financial crisis , they have hardly disappeared , given the tenuous situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the unresolved problems in Iraq , Iran , and North Korea . 
Moreover , the power of America &apos;s presidency , and of the United States , has undergone dramatic shifts in recent years , making our era unlike earlier periods when the world was in flux and a new American president faced deep challenges . 
Until recently , it was possible to speak of &quot; the rise of the rest &quot; without forecasting a decrease in American power . 
Now , with the US military at its limit in Iraq and Afghanistan and the US fiscal position weakening , America is confronted with stark choices . 
That is an unfamiliar position for a new US president . 
Even in the dark years after Vietnam in the late 1970 &quot; s and early 1980 &quot; s , there was a sense that America could still make its economic choices without much reference to the wider world . 
That was the privilege of having the largest , most dynamic economy - and one that acted as a world creditor . 
No more . 
There is no small irony in the fact that on November 15 , America &apos;s lame duck president , the unilateralist George W. Bush , is hosting a multilateral conference to discuss reshaping the global economic system . 
It also speaks to America &apos;s relative position that even the less-than-organized ministers of the European Union acted more quickly to create a floor for the financial crisis than did the US president and congress . 
And it speaks volumes to the changing world that , as panic recedes and the wreckage is revealed , Asia in general and China in particular are emerging as clear winners . 
The credit crisis exposed the flimsy foundations of the sustained growth that the US and Europe enjoyed during the past four to five years . 
While many had noted the extraordinary wealth transfer to oil-producing states and China , the implications of this were not fully appreciated . 
It is not just that the US has become a debtor nation ; it is that large pools of capital and liquidity now reside in places like the Gulf region and China , with no sign of that trend reversing . 
In fact , the current crisis has even put Japan , which has spent nearly two decades in the doldrums , in a position of relative strength , given its large currency reserves and the clean-up of its major banks &quot; balance sheets . 
There was a brief period in the 1970 &quot; s when a similar transfer took place . 
But , unlike then , the countries that are accumulating the capital today are not spending it on consumption - remember the endless pictures of Saudi princes buying up real estate on the French Riviera - but on investment , infrastructure , and education . 
Yes , there are bubbles here and there , whether it is real estate in Shanghai and Dubai or stocks in Mumbai , but there has also been serious long-range planning that is likely to give these countries a strong position for years to come . 
Even China , which is trying to shift its economy more toward consumption in order to reduce its dependence on capital spending , has put in place an infrastructure of roads , power grids , ports , and railways that will serve its domestic economy for decades . 
Meanwhile , it can use its $ 2 trillion of reserves as a cushion when the US and global economy sag . 
China &apos;s economic growth may slow as its exports to the US and Europe weaken , but it is less dependent on these markets than most people assume . 
The talk now is of a global recession that will be steep and prolonged . 
Perhaps , but the more likely scenario is continued stagnation in the US and Europe and a more accelerated shift in economic power toward Asia . 
Few parts of Asia are structurally exposed to the credit implosion , and the balance sheets of Asian banks and companies are on the whole cleaner than their counterparts elsewhere . 
Yes , many companies took on too much debt , and some countries , such as Korea , are more compromised than others . 
But China , which is Asia &apos;s anchor , is not , and in a world where everyone else is falling down , the one left standing is that much taller . 
The US will remain a powerful part of the global system , but the task of the new president is to recognize lasting strengths and accept new limits . 
President-elect Obama has shown pragmatism and realism , and seems to understand that accepting limitations is not weakness ; refusal to acknowledge reality is .
