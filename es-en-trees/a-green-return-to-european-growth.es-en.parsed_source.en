A Green Return to European Growth 
THE HAGUE - Mitigating climate change is often presented as imposing a trade-off between the economy and the environment . 
For too long , the debate has been framed around the concept of &quot; burden-sharing . &quot; 
But new analysis by a team from six leading European universities and institutes casts new light on this debate , and shows that Europe can make choices that are in its own best economic and environmental interest . 
The analysis contained in our new report , A New Growth Path for Europe - Generating Prosperity and Jobs in the Low-Carbon Economy , is based on a comprehensive assessment of European growth prospects in the aftermath of the financial crisis . 
Its publication is timely , because the European Union will decide this year whether to raise its target for greenhouse-gas reduction . 
Increasing the current emissions target from -20 % to -30 % by 2020 compared to 1990 would represent an important opportunity to revitalize the European economy - independently of what the rest of the world did in terms of climate policy . 
Over the coming decade , seizing that opportunity would increase the size of Europe &apos;s economy considerably - by up to 5 % over the next decade . 
This translates into six million new jobs and an increase in GDP of up to € 800 billion by 2020 . 
The reason for these results is straightforward : increasing Europe &apos;s climate-policy efforts boosts investments , thus inducing learning-by-doing , especially when these efforts are channeled into new technologies like renewable energy and advanced construction materials . 
Learning-by-doing , in turn , increases competitiveness and spurs economic growth , thereby improving investors &quot; expectations - and inducing further investment . 
Unfortunately , studies of the economic impact of a -30 % target have relied on traditional equilibrium models that neglect these multiplier effects . 
Their estimates of the economic consequences of raising the target result in moderate additional costs , ranging from 0-2 % of GDP in 2020 . 
The new study uses an approach similar to that underpinning Germany &apos;s 2020 emissions-reduction target of -40 % . 
At last year &apos;s United Nations-sponsored climate-change conference in Cancún , Mexico , German Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen noted that , &quot; In Germany , there has been a shift in thinking over the past years : in industry , politics , and society , we now see climate policy as an opportunity and challenge , not as a threat . &quot; 
Röttgen is right . 
Imagine a gathering of textile entrepreneurs in 1800 debating whether to introduce steam machines to mechanize their cotton mills . 
One of them calculates that the costs would be prohibitive across their hundreds of plants . 
If the rest accepted this bottom-up calculation , society would miss out on the 0.5 % boost to annual growth that this radical innovation ultimately brought about . 
The benefit to the entire economy was bigger than the sum of the benefits for the individual mills . 
It was not the invention of the steam engine alone that deserves the credit . 
Then as now , such breakthroughs generate a cascade of learning and innovation as suppliers , contractors. and customers adapt to a new way of operating . 
Every new major technological idea - the steam engine , railways , or the personal computer - adds up to a boost to growth . 
A New Growth Path for Europe shows how investing in energy efficiency and clean energy has the same potential to revitalize Europe today . 
Indeed , Josef Ackermann , Chairman of Deutsche Bank , recently said that such investments augur &quot; a new industrial revolution - a revolution that will transform the way we live . &quot; 
The analysis shows how all major economic sectors - including many energy-intensive industries - will grow . 
For example , energy-efficient buildings are a boon to the cement and chemical industries . 
Obviously , the fossil-fuel sector would shrink by 2020 as the energy system decarbonizes , with coal being partly displaced by lower-carbon fuels , mainly gas and renewables ( carbon capture and storage and nuclear power cannot make much of a difference by 2020 ) . 
The new EU member states , which have lower energy efficiency , stand to benefit the most - though substantial hurdles must be overcome with additional support mechanisms . 
Because the financial crisis has lowered greenhouse-gas emissions , the -20 % reduction target set before the crisis is no longer challenging enough to catalyze a structural shift in the European economy . 
And , as scientists become gloomier and underline the urgency of tackling climate change , economists are becoming increasingly optimistic about the opportunities implied by a low-carbon future . 
A New Growth Path for Europe supports that optimism , and it calls on the EU to act accordingly .
