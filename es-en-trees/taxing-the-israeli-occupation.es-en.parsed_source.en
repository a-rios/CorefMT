Taxing the Israeli Occupation 
CAIRO - Arab intellectuals and policymakers have often accused Europe of using financial generosity to cover up its political impotence over the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
If Europe is to be taken seriously as a global player , they argue , it must also flex some muscle when it delivers the money . 
In Arab eyes , European officials implicitly plead guilty to these charges by pointing to Europe &apos;s complex multilateral politics and the European Union &apos;s bureaucratic nature . 
Europe &apos;s Arab interlocutors are unimpressed : they want Europe to stop talking like a Great Power and start acting like one . 
But it is precisely the EU &apos;s desire to look more and more like a nation-state that has pushed its position on the Arab-Israeli conflict in the wrong direction . 
Europe &apos;s inability to play a political role in the Middle East peace process was wrongly diagnosed as resulting from a European bias against Israel . 
Policy advisers argued that gaining Israel &apos;s trust was necessary to win support for a European role in the peace process . 
Almost nothing became too dear in this quest : technology transfers , upgraded relations , association agreements , and even , reportedly , the prospect of joining the EU . 
European policy thus revolved around simultaneously seducing Israel and bribing the Palestinian Authority . 
Financing Israel &apos;s occupation of Gaza and the West Bank served both objectives at the same time , at a cost to European taxpayers of several billion euros . 
Yet this policy earned Europe neither recognition nor relevance . 
Palestinians continued to trivialize Europe &apos;s contribution , and Israelis to loathe it for &quot; financing Palestinian terror . &quot; 
In the end , Europe paid a lot of money only to expose its own weakness . 
How much worse can things get before the EU abandons its counter-productive policy ? 
The idea that Europe can seduce the occupier into giving it a role in ending the occupation seems wrong-headed . 
Israel does not want an even-handed mediator but an unconditional supporter . 
This is partly why Israel prefers the United States as sole mediator , and it is also why Israel &apos;s acceptance of a monopoly role for the US evaporates as soon as any American president starts developing views different from its own . 
When this happens , America &apos;s ability to project power makes all the difference . 
In other words , no matter what blandishments are showered on Israel , when push comes to shove it is the ability to use power - not charm - that determines whether or not an outside power has a say in Arab-Israeli peacemaking . 
Europe &quot; s failure to play a role in resolving this conflict does not result from its supposed anti-Israeli views , but from the fact that the EU is not a state . 
States are not given roles ; they acquire them by the power assets they can deploy . 
And Europe cannot deploy the type of power needed to tilt the balance in Arab-Israeli peacemaking . 
But Europe can do other things . 
To change the Israeli-Palestinian dynamic , external actors now need to influence the political calculus inside Israel and Palestine by lowering the political cost of peace and raising the cost of occupation . 
Any meaningful Arab-Israeli peace depends on Israel &apos;s return of Palestinian territories , with certain conditions , but no Israeli government will be willing or even able to do so unless the political calculus inside Israel changes . 
Making withdrawal a tolerable political option ( or making occupation a more costly one ) is needed to trigger a meaningful peace process . 
Europe has already tried incentives for withdrawal , but that alone will not suffice ; the cost of occupation must also be raised . 
In plain English , an &quot; occupation tax &quot; is needed . 
This would be different from applying sanctions , which would risk triggering a &quot; Masada Complex &quot; that might push Israel to further extremes . 
Instead , an occupation tax would target the settlers &quot; economy and the violation of Palestinians &quot; human rights . 
Such a tax should start with turning the EU current exclusion of settlements &quot; products from preferential customs treatment into a full-scale ban on imports from settlements - and any transactions with them . 
Companies and banks should be barred from doing business in or with settlements , especially with construction companies and their suppliers . 
Pressure should be exerted on Israel to end its financial assistance to settlements . 
The occupation tax should also include action aimed at ending the virtual impunity enjoyed by the Israel Defense Force . 
IDF officials argue that some level of human rights violation is inevitable during occupation , and that the IDF &apos;s record is not much worse than any other occupation army . 
They are right ; an occupation cannot be sustained without the systematic violation of human rights . 
That is precisely why these violations must be made costly : to signal to Israeli voters that the cost of occupation is bound to rise . 
This can be done if Europe supports investigations of suspected war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law committed by the IDF , as well as the establishment of international tribunals when such crimes occur . 
Only the US can bring Israelis and Palestinians to a new negotiation process , much less draft a blueprint for a political solution . 
Europe and others can support such a process , but mainly by affecting the internal political calculus in Israel . 
Such a role would better protect Europe &apos;s broader interests in the Middle East , while allowing it to remain faithful to its values .
