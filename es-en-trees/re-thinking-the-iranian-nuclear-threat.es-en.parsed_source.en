Re-Thinking the Iranian Nuclear Threat 
Would it be a great disaster if Iran had nuclear weapons ? 
As a habitual contrarian , I pose the question because almost everyone seems to believe that it would , and that it must be prevented at all costs . 
But is that true ? 
John Bolton , the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations , said in April that &quot; if the choice is &#91; Iran &#93; continuing &#91; towards a nuclear bomb &#93; or the use of force , I think you &apos;re at a Hitler marching into the Rhineland point . &quot; 
Bush , too , has compared Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Hitler . 
But these so-called statesmen never consider what might have happened had Germany and Britain both had nuclear weapons in 1939 . 
Would Hitler , wicked as he was , have gone to war had he faced an assured threat of total destruction ? 
Have we forgotten all about the theory of deterrence ? 
Of course , the world would be safer if Iran did not have nuclear weapons , not because it is a &quot; rogue &quot; state , but because any spread of nuclear weapons is likely to make the world more dangerous . 
That is why it is worth continuing to make every effort to dissuade Iran from &quot; going nuclear . &quot; 
Suppose , though , that it becomes clear that Iran is playing the West along , simply buying time to build a bomb and develop a delivery system to hit Israel . 
Would that justify a pre-emptive military strike , as certain circles in Israel and the US advocate ? 
Military intervention in Iran could go either way . 
Iran might lie down peacefully like Libya did when America bombed it , or turn into another Iraq . 
My own instinct is that it would unleash a train of uncontrollable events . 
It would ignite an already incendiary part of the world , with the added risk of global economic collapse if the Strait of Hormuz , through which one-fifth to one-third of the world &apos;s oil passes , is blocked . 
On this view , if America is determined to use force to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state , it would have to establish a quasi-permanent empire in the Middle East . 
It is to avoid this imperialist logic that sensible Americans like Henry Kissinger and George Shultz have revived the dream of a nuclear-free world . 
First proposed in the Baruch Plan of 1945 , versions of it have surfaced ever since as the number of nuclear weapons states increased . 
The main idea of the Kissinger initiative is large reductions in US and Russian nuclear stockpiles , backed by improved security arrangements for fissile materials , a more intrusive inspection regime for the nuclear powers , and assistance for civilian nuclear programs . 
A better arms control system would undoubtedly make it more difficult for non-nuclear weapons states to acquire nuclear capability ; but it is hard to see why reductions alone , however dramatic , in the huge number of American and Russian warheads should induce aspiring nuclear powers to give up their nuclear ambitions . Even if America and Russia agreed to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear warheads from 5,000-6,000 each to 1,000 each , why should that stop Iran from wanting to build 50-100 nuclear warheads and short-range delivery systems if it perceives this to be in its national interest ? 
The risk is that if Iran is allowed its bomb , uncontrollable nuclear proliferation would follow . 
However , since the Non-Nuclear Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) came into force in 1970 , only three new nuclear states have emerged - India , Pakistan , and Israel . 
There are two reasons for this . 
First , the control system established by the NPT made it very hard for non-nuclear states to acquire nuclear weapons capability . 
Second , most non-nuclear states were happy enough to live under the security umbrella provided by the superpower nuclear duopoly . 
Given the huge obstacles - technological , economic , and political - to acquiring nuclear weapons , states must have quite specific reasons for wanting to go nuclear , such as the need for security against a regional threat or a perception that a superpower itself threatens the state &apos;s political independence . 
Large barriers to nuclear proliferation thus exist independent of the NPT . 
There is no reason to believe that they would fall if Iran built its own weapon . 
It seems that fear of the US rather than Israel has been the main reason for Iran &apos;s nuclear ambition . 
That is why the attractive idea of a nuclear-free Middle East , in which Iran would renounce nuclear weapons in exchange for a similar move by Israel , appears unrealistic . 
It is the US , not Israel , that Iranian hardliners want to deter , using Israel as a hostage . 
They see going nuclear as a way of limiting US military and geopolitical involvement in the Middle East . 
They bank on eventual American acquiescence , as happened with India . 
Where do we go from here ? 
While voluntary Iranian renunciation of nuclear weapons would be the best outcome for the West , there is no reason to believe that a nuclear-armed Iran would be a danger to the world . 
The floodgates to nuclear proliferation would not open ; a more likely outcome would be a &quot; balance of terror &quot; between Israel and Iran , as exists between India and Pakistan . 
However , if Iran were allowed to become a nuclear weapons state , it should be done by agreement with the five &quot; legal &quot; nuclear powers ( the US , Russia , Britain , France , and China ) - that is , by an officially sanctioned enlargement of the nuclear club , which would include India , Pakistan , and Israel . 
This would be the best way to bind Iran to acceptable rules of behavior . 
At the very least , we should be clear that military intervention is the third-best ( that is , worst ) option . 
We might be driven to it if the other two fail , but it would be utterly wrong to contemplate it now .
