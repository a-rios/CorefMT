The War Against Iraq &apos;s Children 
Iraq &apos;s children have suffered more than just successive wars and economic sanctions . 
The loss of parents and family resources has boosted child labor , homelessness , and inclinations towards violence and rebellion . 
They often now live in homes where 25 people live in a space of 40 square meters . 
Even intact families may comprise parents and five children in a single six-meter room . 
The increase in child labor reflects families &quot; dire economic situation : children are frequently a family &apos;s only breadwinners , and they work cheap . 
Contractors in municipal services , for example , prefer to use children in order to cut costs . 
Here , a child may be used for agricultural labor or for janitorial work . 
Many work in piles of garbage , either removing them to another place or collecting empty bottles and cans to sell . 
Other children load and transport items in the markets , where they must pull carts weighing 60-70 kilograms and carry boxes weighing 15 kilograms in temperatures of 50 degrees centigrade . 
Two children may unload a truck carrying 1,000 kilograms of food items . 
Not surprisingly , Iraq &apos;s child workers suffer from a wide array of serious health problems . 
Children who work in the garbage dumps are prone to skin and respiratory problems , while those who work with paints eventually become addicted to the intoxicants that they inhale . 
And all working children are vulnerable to malnutrition , as their diet typically lacks the items necessary to build body tissues . 
Nor is there any official authority to protect children and defend their rights in case of incapacitation or sickness . 
On the contrary , children are often beaten by family members if they do not provide the daily wage expected of them , or by their bosses when they are inattentive or make a mistake . 
Indeed , Iraqi children are exposed to beating without regard for their age and for myriad reasons , thus growing up insecure , hostile , and violent . 
Moreover , they are prone to being kidnapped by criminal gangs , trained to steal or pickpocket , or , worse , placed at the mercy of terrorists for use in attacks . 
The deterioration of families &quot; financial situation has also left poor children deprived of educational opportunity . 
For many children , even when they do attend school , the collapse of infrastructure , the unavailability of electricity and water , and high temperatures in the summer are hardly conducive to successful study . 
The small number of schools , the poor condition of buildings , and the collapse of relationships between students and teachers is also at fault . 
Older children sit in classrooms with much younger children , growing frustrated and violent , rather than becoming role models for others to emulate . 
Iraqi girls suffer no less than boys - and often more . 
At one end of the spectrum of deprivation , their opportunities are more constrained . 
When a family &apos;s income is insufficient to pay school fees for every child , girls are typically denied an education , owing to the traditional belief that marriage is a girl &apos;s final destiny . 
They must perform household chores and are subject to beating if they do not carry out orders issued by male family members . 
In poor households , they are also likely to receive less food than boys , placing their physical health and development at even greater risk . 
At the other end of the spectrum , rape , adultery , early child bearing , and abortion have become ordinary matters . 
Increasingly , Iraqi girls interpret anything given to them as a means to have sex with them . 
Orphans , whose number has increased sharply over the past quarter-century as a result of wars , economic sanctions , and terrorism , are especially vulnerable to the cruelest type of physical and psychological violence . 
Having lost their homes and parents , they sleep in alleys , sell cigarettes or newspapers , and beg . 
Grandparents are often unable or unwilling to care for them , and the pathological education given to them by criminal gangs often puts them beyond the reach of any institution &apos;s ability to rehabilitate them . 
Simply put , children in Iraq have been reduced from human beings worthy of care to tools of production and instruments of violence . 
We are quite literally breeding a new generation of disorder .
