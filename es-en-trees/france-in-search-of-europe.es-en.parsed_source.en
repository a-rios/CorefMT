France in Search of Europe 
With its ten new members , the European Union comprises 25 countries and 453 million citizens . 
In light of the fact that during the past millennium the EU &apos;s members fought countless wars with each other , and that for forty five years a cold war split the continent into two hostile blocs , today &apos;s Europe is a success of monumental historical significance . 
Indeed , the EU represents many things simultaneously . 
First , it is a guarantee of peace : war is now technically impossible between the Union &apos;s interlinked member countries . 
Moreover , the EU is a majestic instrument for international reconciliation . 
The Germans and the French , who 60 years ago loved each other about as much as Serbs and Bosnians do today , are now a married couple . 
Catholics and Protestants in Ireland were killing each other for a century , but now that they are in the EU , they have recognized the idiocy of their conflict and the inevitability of reconciliation . 
Hungarians and Romanians , after nine centuries of hatred and wars , are embarking on the same process . 
Greece has just decided to support the opening of negotiations for Turkey &apos;s entry into the EU in the next twelve years . 
The Union has also been a bearer of prosperity , because it is an effective mechanism for lagging members to surmount long-standing barriers to development . 
Ireland and Greece , once the two poorest countries of Europe have surged economically , with Greece coming close to the European average and Ireland having already taken its place among the richest . 
It is for these reasons that countries outside the EU want to join . 
In less than two years , this will become a reality for Bulgaria and Romania , while negotiations are beginning with Croatia and Turkey . 
There is also talk about membership for Serbia and Ukraine . 
For each of these countries , membership will mean a stable peace with its neighbors and reconciliation at home , as well as accelerated economic growth . 
All of this entails a certain amount of instability , particularly if expansion is driven by negotiations among governments , rather than by democratic choices . 
The project of the new European Constitution was devised to remedy this problem . 
If it does , the result will be an earthquake . 
Although every member nation has played its part in integrating Europe , France has without doubt been the country that provided most of the ideas and master builders . 
So what is going on ? 
In France , as elsewhere in Europe , there have always existed unbridled nationalists , the &quot; sovereignists &quot; who say no to Europe in the name of defending the nation . 
Over and above that , two factors explain the bizarre phenomenon captured by recent opinion polls in France . 
The first is that the French have accounts to settle with their president and the government . 
Jacques Chirac was re-elected president with 82 % of the vote because of the menace from the extreme right . 
According to all evidence , half of his votes came from the left . 
&quot; Let &apos;s make the poor pay &quot; is his fiscal order of the day . 
It smacks of usurpation and is inciting many of the French to vote their anger . 
The other factor is that France , like the rest of the world , suffers from an ill-managed form of globalization . 
As a result , France suffers from growing inequality , high and still-rising unemployment , constant corporate restructurings entailing layoffs , threats to public services and social welfare programs , and a general feeling of insecurity . 
The world has undergone massive economic deregulation , prescribed by the monetarist doctrine supported by the conservative forces dominant in the developed countries of North America , Europe , and the Far East . 
This economic tsunami has come to us from the United States - there is nothing in it for Europe , but the right-wing forces in all our countries , which have coalesced into the majority that governs Europe , have rallied to its support . 
It is the desire to reject this state of affairs that , above all else , explains the &quot; No &quot; many French people want to shout . 
Only Europe as a whole , focused politically on the idea of better regulation , is big enough to block the neo-liberal tsunami . 
Indeed , rejection of the EU Constitution is a sure way to kill European dynamism and weaken Europe &apos;s ability to defend itself . 
The debate in France is still raging , and nothing is yet lost . 
The French people still have time to pull themselves together - and opinion polls suggest that they are beginning to do it . 
Europe deserves it .
