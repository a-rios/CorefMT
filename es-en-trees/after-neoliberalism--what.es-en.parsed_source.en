After Neoliberalism , What ? 
Two decades of applying neoliberal economic policies to the developing world have yielded disappointing results . 
Latin America , the region that tried hardest to implement the &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; recipes - free trade , price deregulation , and privatization - has experienced low and volatile growth , with widening inequalities . 
Among the former socialist economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union , few have caught up with real output levels that prevailed before 1990 . 
In Sub-Saharan Africa , most economies failed to respond to the adjustment programs demanded by the IMF and World Bank . 
The few instances of success occurred in countries that marched to their own drummers - and that are hardly poster children for neoliberalism . 
China , Vietnam , India : all three violated virtually every rule in the neoliberal guidebook , even as they moved in a more market-oriented direction . 
It is time to abandon neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus . 
But the challenge is to provide an alternative set of policy guidelines for promoting development , without falling into the trap of promulgating yet another impractical blueprint , supposedly right for all countries at all times . 
The record suggests that an adequate growth program needs to be anchored in two strategies : an investment strategy designed to kick-start growth in the short term , and an institution-building strategy designed to provide an economy with resilience in the face of adverse shocks . 
The key to investment strategy is to get domestic entrepreneurs excited about the home economy . 
Encouraging foreign investment or liberalizing everything and then waiting for things to improve does not work . 
An effective strategy must accomplish two tasks : encourage investment in non-traditional areas , and weed out projects and investments that fail . 
For this , governments must deploy both the carrot and the stick . 
Learning what a country is ( or can be ) good at producing is a key challenge of economic development . 
The carrot is needed because there is great social value in discovering , for example , that cut flowers , or soccer balls , or computer software can be produced at low cost , because this knowledge can orient the investments of other entrepreneurs . 
The entrepreneur who makes the initial &quot; discovery &quot; can capture only a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates , as other entrepreneurs will quickly emulate him . 
Consequently , entrepreneurship of this type - learning what can be produced - will typically be under-supplied in the absence of non-market incentives . 
In turn , the stick is needed to ensure that these incentives do not lock in unproductive and wasteful investments . 
Implementing such a strategy may differ from country to country , depending on administrative capacity , the prevailing incentive regime , the flexibility of the fiscal system , the degree of sophistication of the financial sector , and the underlying political economy . 
Time-bound subsidy schemes , public venture funds , and export subsidization are some of the ways in which this approach can be implemented , but there are many others . 
No single instrument will work everywhere . 
Governments without adequate capacity to exercise leadership over their private sectors are likely to mess things up rather than improve allocation of resources . 
The job can be done , but economic growth requires more than eliciting a temporary boost in investment and entrepreneurship . 
It also requires effort to build four types of institutions required to maintain growth momentum and build resilience to shocks : 
Market-creating institutions ( for property rights and contract enforcement ) ; 
Market-regulating institutions ( for externalities , economies of scale , and information about companies ) ; 
Market-stabilizing institutions ( for monetary and fiscal management ) ; 
Market-legitimizing institutions ( for social protection and insurance ) . 
Building and solidifying these institutions , however , takes time . 
Using an initial period of growth to experiment and innovate on these fronts can pay high dividends later on . 
A key point here is that institutional arrangements are , by necessity , country-specific . 
Discovering what works in any one country requires experimentation . 
After all , institutions are not hot-house plants capable of being planted in any soil and climate . 
Reforms that succeed in one setting may perform poorly or fail completely in others . 
Such specificity helps explain why successful countries - China , India , South Korea , and Taiwan , among others - usually combined unorthodox elements with orthodox policies . 
It also accounts for why important institutional differences persist among the advanced countries of North America , Western Europe , and Japan in areas such as the role of the public sector , the legal system , corporate governance , financial markets , labor markets , and social insurance . 
While economic analysis can help in making institutional choices , there is also a large role for public deliberation and collective choice . 
In fact , we can think of participatory democracy as a meta-institution that helps select among the &quot; menu &quot; of possible institutional arrangements in each area . 
Designing such a growth strategy is both harder and easier than implementing standard neoliberal policies . 
It is harder because the binding constraints on growth are usually country-specific and do not respond well to standardized recipes . 
But it is easier because once those constraints are appropriately targeted , relatively simple policy changes can yield enormous economic payoffs and start a virtuous cycle of growth and institutional reform . 
Adopting this approach does not mean abandoning mainstream economics - far from it . 
Neoliberalism is to neoclassical economics as astrology is to astronomy . 
In both cases , it takes a lot of blind faith to go from one to the other . 
Critics of neoliberalism should not oppose mainstream economics - only its misuse .
