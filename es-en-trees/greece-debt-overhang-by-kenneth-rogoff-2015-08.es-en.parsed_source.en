A New Deal for Debt Overhangs ? 
CAMBRIDGE - The International Monetary Fund &apos;s acknowledgement that Greece &apos;s debt is unsustainable could prove to be a watershed moment for the global financial system . 
Clearly , heterodox policies to deal with high debt burdens need to be taken more seriously , even in some advanced countries . 
Ever since the onset of the Greek crisis , there have been basically three schools of thought . 
First , there is the view of the so-called troika ( the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the IMF ) , which holds that the eurozone &apos;s debt-distressed periphery ( Greece , Ireland , Portugal , and Spain ) requires strong policy discipline to prevent a short-term liquidity crisis from morphing into a long-term insolvency problem . 
The orthodox policy prescription was to extend conventional bridge loans to these countries , thereby giving them time to fix their budget problems and undertake structural reforms aimed at enhancing their long-term growth potential . 
This approach has &quot; worked &quot; in Spain , Ireland , and Portugal , but at the cost of epic recessions . 
Moreover , there is a high risk of relapse in the event of a significant downturn in the global economy . 
The troika policy has , however , failed to stabilize , much less revive , Greece &apos;s economy . 
A second school of thought also portrays the crisis as a pure liquidity problem , but views long-term insolvency as an outside risk at worst . 
The problem is not that the debt of countries on the eurozone &apos;s periphery is too high , but that it has not been allowed to rise nearly high enough . 
This anti-austerity camp believes that even when private markets totally lost confidence in Europe &apos;s periphery , northern Europe could easily have solved the problem by co-signing periphery debt , perhaps under the umbrella of Eurobonds backed ultimately by all ( especially German ) eurozone taxpayers . 
The periphery countries should then have been permitted not only to roll over their debt , but also to engage in full-on countercyclical fiscal policy for as long as their national governments deemed necessary . 
In other words , for &quot; anti-austerians , &quot; the eurozone suffered a crisis of competence , not a crisis of confidence . 
Never mind that the eurozone has no centralized fiscal authority and only an incomplete banking union . 
Never mind moral-hazard problems or insolvency . 
All of the debtors will be good for the money in the future , even if they have not always been reliable in the past . 
In any case , faster GDP growth will pay for everything , thanks to high fiscal multipliers . 
Europe passed up a free lunch . 
This is a fully coherent viewpoint , but naive in its unqualified confidence ( for example , in the polemical writings of the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman ) . 
As a result , the anti-austerian view masks strong assumptions and risks . 
In fact , piling loans atop already-high debt burdens in the eurozone &apos;s periphery entailed a significant gamble , particularly as the crisis erupted . 
Political corruption , exemplified by the revolving door between Spain &apos;s government and financial sector , was endemic . 
Dual labor markets and product-market monopolies still hobble growth , and oligarchs have disproportionate power to protect their interests . 
In reality , Germany could not have underwritten all of the European periphery &apos;s debt without risking its own solvency and creditworthiness , particularly in the absence of a functioning system of eurozone-wide checks and balances . 
Expansive and open-ended guarantees might have worked , but if they didn &apos;t , the economic rot from the periphery could have spread to the center . 
A third point of view is that , given the massive financial crisis , Europe &apos;s debt problem should have been diagnosed as an insolvency problem from the start , and treated with debt restructuring and forgiveness , aided by moderately elevated inflation and structural reform . 
This has been my viewpoint since the crisis began . 
In Ireland and Spain , private bondholders , not Irish and Spanish taxpayers , should have taken the hit from bank failures . 
In Greece , there should have been faster and larger debt write-downs . 
Of course , national governments would have had to use taxpayer funds to recapitalize northern European banks - especially in France and Germany - that lent too much to the periphery . 
But at least then the public would have understood the reality of the situation , while restructured and recapitalized banks would have been in a position to start lending again . 
Unfortunately , too many policymakers in advanced economies allowed themselves to believe that such heterodox policies are only for emerging markets . In fact , advanced countries have resorted to heterodox policies to reduce debt overhangs on many occasions . 
Debt restructuring would have given Europe the reset it needed . 
Yes , there would have been risks , as IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard has pointed out , but running those risks would have been well worth it . 
So what is the way forward ? 
Deeper European integration , stricter equity requirements for banks , and deeper but homegrown structural reforms are certainly key elements of any solution . 
Further aid to the European periphery is still badly needed . 
But , beyond that , Europe &apos;s experience ought to spur a full rethink of the global system for administering sovereign bankruptcies . 
There is no free lunch in Europe , and there never was ; but there are much better ways to deal with unsustainable debt .
