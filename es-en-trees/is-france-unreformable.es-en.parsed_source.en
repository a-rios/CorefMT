Is France Unreformable ? 
It all began a year ago with the French &quot; No &quot; in the referendum on the European Constitution . 
It continued last fall with the wave of violence in the suburbs . 
Now , France has again brought itself to the world &apos;s attention with weeks of street demonstrations against the &quot; contract of first employment &quot; ( CFE ) proposed by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin to address high youth unemployment . 
These three sets of events , different as they are , together illustrate several deep-seated characteristics of social life in France . 
First , France has found it difficult to adjust to the demands of globalization . 
Beyond ordinary dissatisfaction with economic problems , the failed referendum in May 2005 expressed the rejection by an important part of the French electorate of the discipline imposed by EU policies ensuring free movement of people , goods , and capital - and thus of the primacy of economic competition . 
In a similar vein , last fall &apos;s explosion of violence in the suburbs reflected the frustrations of disoriented young people facing the grim prospects that a modern economy offers to those who lack proper training and education . 
The young are also at the center of the most recent protests , but this time , the disaffected include all strata of French youth , including university graduates . 
In combating the CFE , they express their refusal to accept a precarious life outside the French model of job security that their parents enjoyed in the context of a profoundly different economy . 
There is something very French about all this , because , while the economic rules of the game have changed throughout Europe in the last couple of decades , the need for greater labor-market flexibility seems to have been accepted more easily in most other countries . 
In Spain , under a socialist government , roughly one-third of wage earners are working on temporary contracts ; the percentage is even higher for the young . 
In Italy , greater employment flexibility was introduced by the Prodi government in 1997 , and further strengthened under the so-called Biagi Law of 2003 . 
In Germany too , the coalition agreement between the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats includes a provision that extends from six months to two years the trial period during which an employee can be dismissed without explanation - the same duration contemplated in the Villepin &apos;s CFE law . 
In all these European countries , the new employment laws seem to be accepted as inevitable . 
In France , by contrast , the statist tradition - which , as Tocqueville so aptly observed , harks back to the Ancien RÃ©gime , and which is equally shared today by both the Gaullist and socialist ideologies - is strongly linked to a marked distaste toward the strictures of economic liberalism . 
Since the French Revolution , the imperative of equality has often triumphed over the concern for liberty . 
As a result , the French are enamored with the welfare state in all its manifestations . 
Not even the obvious failures of the French social model in today &apos;s environment - mass unemployment ( reaching 25 % among the young ) , huge public deficits , the blockage of social mobility - have diminished its public prestige . 
It would be much more logical to take inspiration instead from the Scandinavian model of &quot; flexisecurity , &quot; which combines employment flexibility and social security ( albeit at the cost of a tax burden that France would not easily accept ) . 
Add to all this the French preference for ideological confrontation and the absence of a culture of negotiation and compromise , to say nothing of consensus , and one can understand why so many reform projects in France end up being contested in the streets . 
Indeed , quite significantly , most observers have automatically associated the recent disturbances with those of May 1968 , which continues to hold a strange fascination for the French . 
In truth , however , other than reflecting the French preference for the politics of the street , the two phenomena have nothing in common . 
So is France unreformable ? 
Certainly not . 
The country has been transformed profoundly in the recent decades . 
Whether it is the breakup of public monopolies , such as electricity , gas , telecommunications , and even the post office , or the replacement of military conscription by a professional military , or pension reform , France has changed much more than is commonly believed . 
This is particularly true with respect to French companies , which have remarkably adapted to the demands of international competition . 
But much remains to be done : the entire educational system , up through the university level , requires serious reform , and many taboos regarding employment rules , social security , and the functioning of the state must be questioned . 
What the experience with the CFE shows is not that reform is impossible , but that it cannot be unilaterally imposed . 
Time must be taken for explanation , consultation , and negotiation . 
In a society like France , marked by uncertainty about the future and in great need of having its self-confidence restored , the time taken to build consensus and create legitimacy for further reforms will certainly be well spent .
