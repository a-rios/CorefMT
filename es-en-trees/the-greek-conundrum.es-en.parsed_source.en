The Greek Conundrum 
The euro is a unique and unusual construction whose viability is now being tested . 
Otmar Issing , one of the fathers of the common currency , correctly stated the principle on which it was founded : the euro was meant to be a monetary union , but not a political one . 
The participating states established a common central bank , but they explicitly refused to surrender the right to tax their citizens to a common authority . 
This principle was enshrined in Article 125 of the Maastricht Treaty , which has since been rigorously interpreted by the German constitutional court . 
The principle , however , is patently flawed . 
A fully-fledged currency requires both a central bank and a treasury . 
The treasury need not be used to tax citizens on an everyday basis , but it needs to be available in times of crisis . 
When the financial system is in danger of collapsing , the central bank can provide liquidity , but only a treasury can deal with problems of solvency . 
This is a well-known fact that should have been clear to everyone involved in the euro &apos;s creation . 
Issing admits that he was among those who believed that &quot; starting monetary union without having established a political union was putting the cart before the horse . &quot; 
The European Union was brought into existence step-by-step by putting the cart before the horse : setting limited but politically attainable targets and timetables , knowing full well that they would not be sufficient , and thus that further steps would be required in due course . 
But , for various reasons , the process gradually ground to a halt . 
The EU is now largely frozen in its current shape . 
The same applies to the euro . 
The crash of 2008 revealed the flaw in the euro &apos;s construction , as each member country had to rescue its own banking system instead of doing it jointly . 
The Greek debt crisis brought matters to a climax . 
If member countries cannot take the next steps forward , the euro may fall apart , with adverse consequences for the EU . 
The original construction of the euro postulated that each member would abide by the limits set by the Maastricht Treaty . 
But previous Greek governments egregiously violated those limits . 
The Papandreou government , elected in October 2009 with a mandate to clean house , revealed that the budget deficit reached 12.7 % of GDP in 2009 , shocking both the European authorities and the markets . 
The European authorities accepted a plan that would reduce the deficit gradually , but the markets were not reassured . 
The risk premium on Greek government bonds continues to hover around three percentage points , depriving Greece of much of the benefit of euro membership - namely , being able to refinance government bonds at the official discount rate . 
With the risk premium at current levels , there is a real danger that Greece may not be able to extricate itself from its predicament , regardless of what it does , because further budget cuts would further depress economic activity , reducing tax revenues and worsening the debt-to-GDP ratio . 
Given that danger , the risk premium will not revert to its previous level in the absence of outside assistance . 
The situation is aggravated by the market in credit default swaps , which is biased in favor of those who speculate on failure . 
Being long CDS , the risk automatically declines if they are wrong . 
This is the exact opposite of short-selling in equity markets , where being wrong means that the risk automatically increases . 
Recognizing the need , the last Ecofin meeting has , for the first time , committed itself &quot; to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . &quot; 
But Ecofin has not yet found the mechanism for doing so , because the current institutional arrangements do not provide one - although the Lisbon Treaty establishes a legal basis for it . 
The most effective solution would be to issue jointly and separately guaranteed eurobonds to refinance , say , 75 % of the maturing debt , as long as Greece meets its agreed-upon targets , leaving Greece to finance the rest of its needs as best it can . 
This would significantly reduce the cost of financing , and it would be the equivalent of the IMF disbursing its loans in tranches as long as conditions are met . 
But this is politically impossible at present , because Germany is adamantly opposed to serving as the deep pocket for its profligate partners . 
Therefore , makeshift arrangements will have to be found . 
The Papandreou government is determined to do whatever is necessary to correct the abuses of the past , and it enjoys a remarkable degree of public support . 
There have been mass protests and resistance from the old guard of the governing party , but the general public seems ready to accept austerity as long as it sees progress in correcting budgetary abuses - and there are plenty of abuses to allow progress . 
So makeshift assistance will be sufficient to allow Greece to succeed , but that leaves Spain , Italy , Portugal , and Ireland . 
Together they constitute too large a portion of the euro zone to be helped out by makeshift arrangements . 
The survival of Greece still leaves the future of the euro in question . 
Even if the EU handles the current crisis , what about the next one ? 
It is clear what is needed : more intrusive monitoring and institutional arrangements for conditional assistance . 
Moreover , a well-organized eurobond market would be desirable . 
The question is whether the political will to take these steps can be generated .
