The Renminbi Goes Forth 
BEIJING - In June , the Peoples &quot; Bank of China ( PBC ) , China &apos;s central bank , announced an end to the renminbi &apos;s 23-month-old peg to the dollar and a return to the pre-crisis exchange-rate regime adopted in July 2005 . 
So far , however , the RMB &apos;s appreciation against the dollar has been slow . 
Will the pace of appreciation accelerate enough to satisfy American demands ? 
If it does , will global imbalances disappear sooner ? 
It is hard to argue that the RMB is not undervalued , given China &apos;s large and persistent current-account and capital-account surpluses . 
But , despite ending the dollar peg , faster appreciation of the RMB seems unlikely for the foreseeable future . 
China &apos;s official position is that , to avoid the negative impact of a stronger RMB on China &apos;s exports and hence employment , appreciation must proceed in an autonomous , gradual , and controllable manner . 
The current exchange-rate regime , which links the RMB to a basket of currencies , was designed to give the PBC leeway to control the pace of RMB appreciation , while creating two-way fluctuations in the exchange rate against the US dollar in order to discourage speculators from making one-way bets on the RMB . 
RMB appreciation should have started earlier and at a faster pace , when China &apos;s trade surplus was much smaller and its growth was much less dependent on exports . 
Delay has made current-account rebalancing via RMB appreciation costly . 
And now China faces a dilemma . 
As a result of the global financial crisis , China &apos;s export growth in 2009 dropped by 34 % compared to 2008 . 
In the first seven months of 2010 , China &apos;s trade surplus was $ 84 billion , down 21.2 % from January-July 2009 . 
This large , steady fall in the country &apos;s trade surplus makes the Chinese government hesitant to allow the RMB to appreciate significantly , for fear of the lagged impact on the trade balance . 
But the PBC is also reluctant to buy dollars constantly . 
The PBC knows that rapid deterioration in America &apos;s fiscal position and continual worsening in its external balance may create an irresistible temptation for the US to inflate away its debt burden . 
The more the PBC intervenes , the larger the national welfare losses that China may suffer in the future . 
The Chinese government must , therefore , strike a balance between protecting China &apos;s export sector and preserving its national welfare . 
The dilemma that officials face is that the impact of a fall in exports as a result of RMB appreciation will be felt acutely and immediately , whereas the large welfare losses due to the evaporation of the value of China &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves will be borne by society as a whole - but not immediately . 
Moreover , the increase in China &apos;s overall price level - and wage levels in particular - has caused the RMB to strengthen steadily in real terms , reducing ( to a certain extent ) the need for nominal RMB appreciation . 
True , commerce ministry officials recently declared their wish to see a further fall of China &apos;s trade surplus in 2010 . 
But RMB appreciation is not the preferred instrument for achieving this goal . 
Thus , nothing dramatic will happen to the RMB exchange rate in the near term - unless something dramatic happens . 
At the same time , the effect of currency appreciation on the trade balance should not be exaggerated . 
The RMB appreciated by 18.6 % in real effective terms , and by 16 % in dollar terms , from June 2005 to August 2008 . 
Yet , from 2006 to 2008 , China &apos;s annual exports grew 23.4 % , outpacing import growth of 19.7 % . 
Exchange rates are just one of many factors that affect trade balances . 
For China &apos;s , the income effect of global demand is significantly larger than the price effect of the exchange rate . 
The fall in China &apos;s trade surplus since late 2008 is attributable mainly to the global slowdown and the stimulus package introduced by the Chinese government , rather than to changes in the RMB &apos;s exchange rate . 
But if the RMB is allowed to float , isn &apos;t a balanced trade account likely ? 
Probably not . 
With a fast-rising RMB , net capital outflows will increase , which is what Japan experienced after the Plaza Accord of 1985 pushed the yen upward . 
As a result , balance-of-payments equilibrium would be reached at a certain exchange-rate level , but a current-account surplus ( albeit smaller ) would still exist . 
America should not pin too much hope on a weakening dollar to correct its trade imbalances . 
For the US , the fundamental cause of imbalances is not a strong dollar , but America &apos;s over-consumption and over-borrowing . 
A strengthening dollar would worsen the US trade balance , but a weakening dollar could cause panic in capital markets , which might push up risk premia on dollar-denominated assets , including US government securities , in turn leading to an economic slowdown and a further weakening of the dollar . 
Of course , RMB appreciation may displace Chinese goods sold in the US . 
But if the US fails to narrow its savings gap , its current-account deficit will not disappear , regardless of where the dollar goes . 
Whether America can achieve decent growth while keeping its current-account deficit in check depends on whether it can reinvigorate its ability to innovate and create , thereby restoring competitiveness and creating demand at the same time . 
For both China and America , the RMB-dollar exchange rate is important for achieving growth and a more balanced current account . 
But that dual objective requires structural change in the Chinese and US economies .
