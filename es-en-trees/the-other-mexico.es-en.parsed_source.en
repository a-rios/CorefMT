The Other Mexico 
SANTIAGO - For once , Mexico is in the news for something good : an election . 
What a contrast to the usual coverage by international news agencies , which seldom involves anything other than evil drug lords , terrifying shootouts , and grisly pictures of decapitated bodies . 
With the ever-present Partido Revolucionario Institucional ( PRI ) , which governed Mexico for seven decades , now due to return to power , one might be tempted to conclude that little has changed in Mexico . 
That assessment would be wrong . 
Mexico today is a vastly different country from what it was under the PRI old guard . 
Change began to accelerate during Ernesto Zedillo &apos;s six-year rule , beginning in 1994 , and has continued under non-PRI administrations since 2000 . 
Drug-related violence , for one thing , is not as widespread as the nightly news might lead one to believe . 
True , 50,000 people have died in President Felipe Calder칩n &apos;s six-year war against drug traffickers . 
And true , Mexico &apos;s murder rate , 18 per 100,000 people , is frighteningly high . 
But Brazil &apos;s is 26 per 100,000 , South Africa &apos;s is 32 , and Venezuela &apos;s is a whopping 67 . 
And the bulk of homicides in Mexico occur in only four states along the United States border . 
In Mexico &apos;s south , murder rates are lower than in the US , and comparable to those in Canada or Chile . 
In the old Mexico , all institutions were controlled or co-opted by the PRI . 
That has also changed . 
Today , Mexico has an independent Supreme Court , an independent elections institute , and an independent Central Bank . 
Regulators , anti-trust officials , and statistical agencies also enjoy a good deal of autonomy . 
The press is freer than ever before , even if television giant Televisa continues to give PRI candidates preferential treatment . 
And civil society is up and running : the student movement # YoSoy132 , organized through social media , turned out to be the biggest and most influential surprise of this election campaign . 
The economy also has changed , and mostly for the better . 
The 2008-2009 global financial crisis hit Mexico hard , but the economy has been growing steadily since . 
The perennial over-borrowing of the old PRI governments is gone , and public finance is on a fairly sound footing . 
Exports have boomed , and the regional value chain that the North American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to bring into being is finally emerging . 
Mexican exports have reached $ 1 billion a day , with manufactured goods accounting for more than 80 % of the total . 
Rising costs in China , coupled with Mexico &apos;s location advantage , mean that the Chinese no longer have an overwhelming advantage in the fight for the US market . 
Last but not least , demography is helping . 
Mexican households are projected to average just 1.7 children in 2013-2014 , a sharp decrease from previous years . 
Unemployment , underemployment , and migration pressures will drop . 
The country &apos;s dependency ratio ( the ratio of those not in the labor force to the productive population ) is approaching an historic low , providing a demographic window of opportunity . 
It is still too early to tell whether the PRI administration of Enrique Pe침a Nieto will revert to some of the bad habits of yesteryear . 
Indeed , with some of the old problems fast receding , other national shortcomings are coming into sharper relief than ever before . 
Should he choose to tackle them , Pe침a Nieto will have his work cut out for him . 
For starters , Mexico remains a country of monopolies . 
In the media , telecommunications , and energy , just to mention a few sectors , incumbents continue to wield too much power , charge excessive prices , and provide mediocre services . 
Private firms have launched a never-ending flow of lawsuits to thwart the efforts of regulators . 
That must come to an end . 
The monopolies are also political . 
Private and public-sector lobbies have fought attempts at reform in monopolized sectors and in others , including education . 
It will require a bold leader to take on the political dinosaurs . 
And , of course , Pe침a Nieto will have to devise a strategy to reduce the drug-related violence in Mexico &apos;s north . 
The issue was strangely absent from the election campaign . 
A growing , less violent , more egalitarian , and more democratic Mexico should be great news . 
If only the world &apos;s news media would report on it .
