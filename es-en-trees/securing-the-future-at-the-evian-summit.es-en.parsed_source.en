Securing the Future at the Evian Summit 
The paradox of our time is the great power of the world &apos;s richest countries to do good , but their seeming compulsion to miss every opportunity to do so . 
The US stands as the supreme example of this : a country that devotes $ 450 billion per year to military spending allocates only $ 12 billion per year to development assistance for poor countries . 
It can bomb Somalia , Afghanistan , and Iraq , but seems ill-equipped to help these places develop . 
Europe is little better , paralyzed as it is by internal divisions and budget deficits . 
Next week &apos;s G-8 summit in Evian , France is a chance to make a fresh start . 
For the one billion people represented at the G-8 Summit , life is extremely good in comparison with the rest of the planet , with average incomes at $ 25,000 per person or more and life expectancy around 80 years . 
For about three billion people in the world today , including China , much of India , and most of East Asia , economic development is proceeding reasonably well , even if it displays a lot of ups and downs ( most recently , the shock of the SARS epidemic ) . 
Positive trends are also seen in Brazil and Mexico . 
But for the world &apos;s remaining two billion people , life remains desperate . 
For roughly one billion people , bare survival is nothing short of precarious . 
Millions die each year because they lack access to medicines , food , safe drinking water , and basic sanitation . 
Their life expectancy is often less than 50 years , and is falling in many places . 
The G-8 could end the suffering of the world &apos;s poorest billion people if it adopted realistic measures to solve their problems . 
They fail to do so not only because they are greedy , but also because they are scared . 
They think that global poverty is inevitable and too expensive to solve . 
But they can solve the problems of the world &apos;s poorest - with relatively little effort and with no noticeable negative impact on their own standard of living . 
The biggest problem areas are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa , the Andean region , and Central Asia . 
Other pockets of extreme poverty , in China and India , are on the path of amelioration due to these two giants &apos; rapid economic growth . 
But the problems in sub-Saharan Africa , the Andes , and Central Asia are not solving themselves . 
These regions are trapped in poverty . 
The worst situation , by far , is in Africa . 
The US government believes that these countries have only themselves to blame for their poverty . 
But this is the ignorant boasting of a rich country that fails to comprehend the situation on the ground . 
Africa is trapped in poverty for deep-seated reasons . 
It suffers from endemic malaria , which is like a SARS pandemic that lasts for centuries , not for a few months . 
It suffers from a climate prone to massive droughts and from soils depleted of nutrients . 
It suffers from the fact that most of its population lives in the rural interior , without paved roads to reach ports and facilitate access to international trade . 
Aside from a few countries in West Africa , it suffers from a serious shortage of energy resources , whether coal or oil or hydroelectric power . 
The US never had to grapple with any one of these problems in the severity that they grip Africa . 
The ultimate irony is that all of these deep problems are amenable to solutions , albeit solutions that require money . 
That is where the G-8 should come in . 
All that is required is for the G-8 leaders to commit , at Evian , to follow through on their previous promises , which for years have remained unfulfilled . 
During the past three years , the world &apos;s leaders have promised concrete action to cut global poverty by one half by the year 2015 , in a series of commitments known as the Millennium Development Goals . 
But only baby steps have followed . 
The US increased foreign aid by perhaps $ 4 billion a year at the same time that it increased military spending by $ 150 billion annually and cut taxes by trillions of dollars . 
Clearly , the US has the means to do vastly more to help the world &apos;s poor , if only it had the foresight . 
Specifically , the G-8 leaders should commit to providing adequate financing for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria ; to raise food productivity in Africa through a new Green Revolution ; to ensure that all poor children have the opportunity to go to school ; and to ensure that poor people everywhere have access to clean drinking water and sanitation . 
The total cost of this agenda , remarkably , would be much less than 1 % of the annual income of rich countries . 
For the first time in history , the rich are so rich , and the poor so poor , that a tiny effort by the rich could end massive suffering . 
The Evian Summit will clarify whether greed , ignorance , and the bombast of war have closed the eyes of the US entirely , and whether Europe and Japan will look inward rather than outward .
