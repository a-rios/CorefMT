When Marijuana is Legal 
BRISBANE - What will happen if Californians votes this November to legalize marijuana use by any adult over the age of 21 years ? 
Let &apos;s ignore for the moment the vexed constitutional issues that will be raised if a US state enacts legislation that conflicts with federal law . 
Let &apos;s focus instead on what may happen if the law changes as the referendum proposes . 
If we are to believe the referendum &apos;s supporters , all Californians will be winners . 
The change will legitimize marijuana &apos;s de facto legal status since passage of Proposition 215 in 1996 . 
It will thus reduce state expenditure on enforcing a widely violated law ; remove marijuana growing and selling from the black market ; enable any adult who wishes to use marijuana to do so ; and introduce a tax on legal marijuana sales that will fill state coffers with revenue that formerly went to illegal growers ( so long as there is no large-scale tax evasion ) . 
By contrast , opponents predict that the change will increase rates of marijuana use , and thus magnify the harm arising from that use . 
The adverse consequences of greatest concern include more marijuana-related road traffic accidents and deaths ; more psychoses and other serious mental health problems among heavy users ; and heavier marijuana use by young people , negatively affecting their life chances . 
These effects , they argue , will more than offset any gains from tax revenue and savings from law enforcement . 
It is difficult to know who is right , because no other country has adopted this policy . 
The Netherlands , which is popularly believed to have legalized cannabis use along these lines , has in fact tolerated only small-scale retail sales of marijuana in a limited number of coffee shops in its larger cities . 
Marijuana cultivation remains illegal and coffee shop sales are regulated - more strictly in recent years in response to complaints from neighboring countries about &quot; drug tourism . &quot; 
Nevertheless , some broad predictions can be made . 
First , openly tolerating a market in a previously illegal commodity will expand the number of users , especially if the retail price is lower than the black-market price ( as is proposed in the Ammiano Bill currently before the California legislature ) . 
Use may not increase immediately , but it will over time , because marijuana will become more freely available , much cheaper ( in order to discourage the persistence of a black market ) , and its use will be implicitly condoned . 
Experience with alcohol suggests that marijuana will be available to underage users ( as it is now ) , whatever the minimum legal age . 
Thus , legally available cheaper marijuana will probably mean more use by more young people , and probably more daily use later into adulthood . 
In general , the more people who use a drug , the larger the number of problem users there will be ( on the reasonable assumption that problem users comprise a fixed proportion of all users ) . 
If current estimates are correct , around 10 % of users ( and one in six who start in adolescence ) may become dependent on marijuana - that is , find it difficult to control or discontinue their use . 
A minority of these problem users will seek professional help to quit . 
Dependent marijuana users are more likely to experience road and workplace accidents ( if they drive or work while intoxicated ) ; increased respiratory disease ( if they smoke marijuana ) ; exacerbations of some serious mental disorders ; and impaired school and work performance . 
It is uncertain how far these adverse effects can be mitigated by preventive measures such as implementing roadside drug-testing programs , persuading users to use vaporizers rather than smoke joints , discouraging young people from using marijuana , and encouraging early treatment for problem users . 
Experience with alcohol suggests that these approaches may modestly reduce , but not eliminate , the harms associated with use , especially if sellers are allowed to promote their wares . 
Indeed , the scale of any increase in marijuana use will critically depend on how tightly regulated marijuana sales are - how many licensed growers there are , the number of sales outlets , their locations and trading hours , eligibility requirements for use , content of THC ( marijuana &apos;s psychoactive ingredient ) , and how much promotion and advertising is allowed . 
If marijuana were allowed to be marketed much like alcohol is now , we could expect more problem users than if it were regulated more like pharmaceutical drugs ( say , by requiring users to be licensed ; restricting the number of sales locations , hours of sale , and licensed growers ; and imposing high rates of taxation on higher-THC marijuana ) . 
It will be a major policy challenge to get this balance right . 
Greater restrictions would provide incentives for illegal operators to remain , while less restrictive regulation would discourage black marketeers , but at the price of increasing the number of users and problem users . 
Marijuana policy involves a choice between the evils of current repressive policies and the evils of increased use under a legal market . 
Californians will have to decide how much weight to give to respect for adult liberty , protection of minors , avoidance of a large-scale black market , fiscal considerations , and protection of marijuana users &quot; health . 
If they vote for legalization , it will probably be 20 years or more before anyone can say whether , on balance , they decided wisely .
