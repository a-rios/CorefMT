European Diplomacy &apos;s First Test 
BRUSSELS - It took eight years of ill-tempered political wrangling to create the European Union &apos;s new diplomatic service , but its fate - and that of its chief , Catherine Ashton - may well be decided over the next few weeks . 
The Union &apos;s failure so far to respond adequately to the crisis engulfing the Arab world is sharpening knives in foreign ministries across Europe . 
From the EU &apos;s point of view , the turmoil engulfing the Arab world couldn &apos;t have come at a worse time . 
The European External Action Service ( EEAS ) , which is meant to enable the EU &quot; to speak with one voice , &quot; was launched only at the end of 2010 and many senior positions remain unfilled . 
But that is a poor excuse for the EU &apos;s inability to put its stamp on the crisis . 
Few know better than the Eurocrats of Brussels that the unrest now sweeping across Arab countries was only a matter of time in coming . 
Back in the 1990 &quot; s , EU officials , prompted by Spain , Italy , and France , began to shape a Mediterranean strategy to stimulate trade and investment in the Arab world . 
Europe already feared that rising youth unemployment in the region would create dangerous instability along Europe &apos;s southern flank . 
Known as the &quot; Barcelona process , &quot; this initiative proved weak and ineffective , because much of its funding was diverted to Eastern Europe for the EU &apos;s ambitious enlargement drive . 
Recently , there have been efforts to revive the strategy by renaming it the Union for the Mediterranean , but still with little concrete achievement . 
In stark contrast to the way that former Soviet-bloc countries have been drawn into the European economy , Arab countries have received little help from the EU , despite the huge challenges they face . 
Europe &apos;s selfish agricultural policies aggravate poverty in North Africa and the Middle East , where the population doubled to 350 million during the last 30 years and is forecast to more than double again by 2030 . 
Europe &apos;s governments are now much criticized for propping up autocratic Arab regimes , but their real failure has been one of omission : the lack of economic cooperation and development assistance offered to the region . 
In the past , there was talk in Brussels of helping Arab countries to develop closer mutual trade links . 
Yet they remain islands of underdevelopment - less than 2 % of the five Maghreb countries &quot; trade is with one another , and much the same is true of the eastern Mediterranean countries of the Mashreq and of the Gulf states . 
A determined EU effort to counter Arab fragmentation and tackle problems ranging from acute water scarcity to poor education would pay rich dividends . 
Indeed , Europe has much to offer the Arab world as it emerges from its political and economic stagnation , but it needs to do so loudly and clearly under the banner of EU leadership . 
And that , unfortunately , has been in short supply . 
The focus has been on Europe &apos;s response to the events that began in Tunisia and have since led to the fall of Egypt &apos;s President Hosni Mubarak , unrest in Bahrain and Yemen , and now civil conflict in Libya . 
The European Council , which groups EU heads of government , met in Brussels on March 11 , but agreed only to call for Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi &apos;s resignation . 
No wider plan for encouraging Arab countries to embrace democracy was mooted , still less one that would make EU economic cooperation conditional on political reform . 
Baroness Ashton &apos;s voice at the recent European Council was characteristically muted . 
She has so far visited Tunisia and Egypt without declaring an EU policy position that commanded attention . 
It has been French President Nicolas Sarkozy , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , and British Prime Minister David Cameron who have vied for the limelight , leaving Ashton in the shadows . 
Her style since arriving in Brussels as the EU &apos;s foreign-policy chief has been distinctly unassuming , but that does not mean that she cannot now show her mettle and seize the initiative . 
The question of intervening in Libya with a no-fly zone has divided EU leaders , and the Arab League &apos;s decision to back it means that it will have to be taken up by NATO , along with the United Nations . 
But the EU can make a much more positive and important contribution to the Arab awakening by launching an economic strategy along the lines laid out by Italy &apos;s foreign minister , Franco Frattini , and Britain &apos;s deputy prime minister , Nick Clegg . 
Ashton &apos;s EEAS could have established a clear lead at a much earlier stage by responding publicly to the spreading Arab unrest . 
It would have been a good idea , for example , to send EEAS observers to selected countries to assess their political mood and economic needs . 
But it is certainly not too late to set out a determined new plan for Euro-Arab cooperation . 
That will not happen if Baroness Ashton remains a low-profile operator . 
In that case , the EEAS itself could become a casualty of events . 
It won &apos;t die of course , as international bureaucracies seldom do , but it risks becoming irrelevant , thus robbing Europe of its global voice .
