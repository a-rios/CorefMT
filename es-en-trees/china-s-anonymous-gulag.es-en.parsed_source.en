China \ u0027s Anonymous Gulag 
With rare candor , China &apos;s government recently released statistics on people arrested and prosecuted for endangering state security , the most serious political offence in the criminal code . 
China &apos;s top prosecutor , Han Zhubin , revealed that more than 3,400 people were arrested from 1998 to 2002 for such crimes as subversion , incitement to subversion , espionage , and trafficking in state secrets . 
Arrests and prosecutions for endangering state security have risen sharply since September 11 , 2001 . 
In the two-year period that ended on December 31 , 2002 , more than 1,600 people were prosecuted for endangering state security , most after the terror attacks on the US . 
Many of those arrested and prosecuted hail from Xinjiang , an autonomous region in the northwest of the country that is home to a large and restive Muslim population . 
China &apos;s government has used the war on terror to crack down on those seeking greater autonomy , including those who do so by peaceful means . 
This includes people like Rebiya Kadeer , a businesswoman imprisoned for sending newspaper articles to her husband in the US , Tohti Tunyaz , a Ph.D. student in Japan accused of publishing &quot; sensitive documents , &quot; and Tursunjan Amat , a poet who recited a pro-independence poem at a public gathering in Urumqi . 
Large as the number of such arrests and prosecutions is , the true extent of the government &apos;s suppression of independent thought and activity is even greater . 
Most members of the Falun Gong and other unauthorized religions are arrested and tried for &quot; using an evil cult to sabotage implementation of the law &quot;  - a crime categorized as &quot; disturbing the social order . &quot; 
Thousands of people are imprisoned for such &quot; evil cult &quot; activities . 
Labor leaders are often charged with &quot; organizing an illegal procession &quot; or &quot; disturbing the social order . &quot; 
Dissidents who attempt to fund their activities by conducting private business sometimes find themselves jailed for economic crimes like fraud and illegal publishing . 
Fang Jue , a reformer who served a four-year term for economic crimes , and Jiang Surang , an underground Catholic priest sentenced to six years for illegally publishing Bibles , were both punished in this way . 
Dissidents picked up by the police but not formally arrested sometimes wind up in re-education camps or in psychiatric hospitals run by the public security bureau . 
Those sentenced to two- or three-year terms of &quot; re-education through labor &quot; are not included in the statistics on endangering state security released by Procurator General Han . 
The names of only a few of the thousands arrested for political crimes are known . 
An exhaustive search of official and unofficial sources turned up fewer that 150 names of individuals arrested for endangering state security in 1998-2002 , a &quot; transparency rate &quot; of less than 5 % . 
Indeed , we know more about the arrests made after the Tiananmen protests of 1989 than about those arrested today . 
What we do know about those arrested is as disturbing as the arrests themselves . 
For example , about one-quarter are non-Han Chinese , principally Tibetans and Uyghurs . 
China is more than 90 % Han . 
Sentences for non-Han Chinese are typically longer than those imposed on Han Chinese . 
Moreover , almost everyone arrested for endangering state security is convicted . 
Appeals , when filed , are routinely rejected . 
In the one or two cases of acquittal , another charge is filed and a conviction obtained . 
That happened to Yue Zhengzhong , who sent an intercepted letter to the US Embassy praising the 1999 bombing of China &apos;s Embassy in Belgrade . 
Prosecuted for inciting subversion , Yue was ultimately convicted of &quot; making a false accusation . &quot; 
He had written that those killed deserved their fate . 
Although some of those convicted of endangering state security are charged with violent crimes - for example , two Tibetans were recent sentenced to death for &quot; inciting separatism &quot; and setting off bombs - the great majority involve non-violent speech and association . 
Dozens of leaders of opposition groups - most unknown to the outside world - were imprisoned in recent years . 
Li Wenshan and Chen Shiqing , leaders of the Chinese Nation &apos;s Democratic Party , which has nearly 1,000 members , are serving long sentences in Gansu Province &apos;s Linxia Prison . 
&quot; Internet dissidents &quot; make up the fastest-growing group of political prisoners . 
Last month , Huang Qi , an Internet entrepreneur arrested for posting articles criticizing the Communist Party , and four young intellectuals who made up the &quot; New Youth Study Group &quot; to hold online discussions about political reform , were sentenced to long prison terms . 
Scholars , too , feel the heat . 
Xu Zerong , a social scientist trained at Harvard and Oxford , is serving a 13-year sentence in Guangdong Province for photocopying materials on Chinese military tactics during the 1950-53 Korean War . 
Many hope that the SARS crisis will encourage China &apos;s leaders to become more transparent and accountable . 
But the way the authorities are handling the epidemic is having the opposite effect . 
Internal travel restrictions are used to keep lawyers from representing dissident clients . 
Prisons are closed to outside visitors . 
Meetings with foreign governments on human rights - during which information is provided on political cases - have been postponed and visits by monitors , including one from the World Psychiatric Association to investigate charges of psychiatric abuse , are on hold . 
No one knows when the long-promised visit by the UN Rapporteur on Torture will take place . 
We may get a better picture of China &apos;s public health system as a result of the SARS crisis , but when it comes to the country &apos;s political health , there is little to suggest that criticism will be tolerated or opposition allowed . 
Those who attempt to change the way China is governed will be dealt with harshly , their names and fates remaining anonymous .
