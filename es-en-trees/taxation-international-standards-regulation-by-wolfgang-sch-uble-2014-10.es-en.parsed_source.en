Why Taxation Must Go Global 
BERLIN - We are witnessing profound changes in the way that the world economy works . 
As a result of the growing pace and intensity of globalization and digitization , more and more economic processes have an international dimension . 
As a consequence , an increasing number of businesses are adapting their structures to domestic and foreign legal systems and taxation laws . 
Thanks to technical advances in the digital economy , companies can serve markets without having to be physically present in them . 
At the same time , sources of income have become more mobile : There is an increasing focus on intangible assets and mobile investment income that can easily be &quot; optimized &quot; from a tax point of view and transferred abroad . 
Tax legislation has not kept pace with these developments . 
Most of the tax-allocation principles that apply today date back to a time when doing business internationally primarily meant transporting goods across a border to a neighboring country . 
They need to be adapted to the economic reality of digital services . 
In the absence of workable rules , states are losing revenue that they urgently need in order to fulfill their responsibilities . 
At the same time , the issue of fair taxation is becoming more and more pressing , because the number of taxpayers who make an adequate contribution to financing public goods and services is decreasing . 
The resulting tensions between national fiscal sovereignty and the borderless scope of today &apos;s business activities can be resolved only through international dialogue and uniform global standards . 
Within the European Union , permitting groups of states to forge ahead with joint solutions to issues that can be addressed only multilaterally has worked well in the past . 
If such measures prove successful , other states follow . 
This approach can also serve as a global governance model for resolving international problems . 
In today &apos;s world , even large states cannot establish and enforce international frameworks on their own . 
Groups of countries still can . 
This has been demonstrated in the context of financial-market regulation ; it is starting to become clear with regard to the regulatory framework for the digital economy ; and it is now being confirmed in the area of taxation . 
The Seventh Meeting of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes took place in Berlin this week , bringing together representatives from 122 countries and jurisdictions , as well as the EU . 
A joint agreement on the automatic exchange of information on financial accounts was signed on Wednesday . 
The joint agreement was originally an initiative by Germany , France , Italy , the United Kingdom , and Spain . 
Roughly 50 early-adopter countries and territories decided to take part , while other countries have indicated their willingness to join . 
The agreement is based on the Common Reporting Standard , which was developed by the OECD . 
Under the CRS , tax authorities receive information from banks and other financial service providers and automatically share it with tax authorities in other countries . 
In the future , virtually all of the information connected to a bank account will be reported to the tax authorities of the account holder &apos;s country , including the account holder &apos;s name , balance , interest and dividend income , and capital gains . 
Various measures are in place to ensure that banks can identify the beneficial owner and notify the relevant tax authorities accordingly . 
The CRS thus expands the scope of global , cross-border cooperation among national tax authorities . 
In this way , we can establish a regulatory framework for the age of globalization . 
The automatic exchange of information is a pragmatic and effective response to the perceived lack of global governance regarding international tax issues . 
By making taxation fairer , governments will have a positive impact on people &apos;s acceptance of their tax regimes . 
This great success in the fight against international tax evasion would have been unthinkable only a few years ago . 
Now it is important to continue the efforts of the OECD and the G-20 in the area of corporate taxation . 
We need to make sure that creative tax planning in the form of profit-shifting and artificial profit reduction is no longer a lucrative business model . 
A &quot; beggar-thy-neighbor &quot; taxation policy , by which one country pursues tax policies at the expense of others , is just as dangerous as beggar-thy-neighbor monetary policies based on competitive currency devaluation . 
It leads to misallocations - and will ultimately reduce prosperity around the world . 
That is why we need to agree on uniform international standards in order to achieve fair international tax competition . 
The progress achieved in Berlin on the automatic exchange of tax information shows that , by working together , we can realize this goal .
