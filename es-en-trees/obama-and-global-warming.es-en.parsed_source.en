Obama and Global Warming 
COPENHAGEN - In one of his first public policy statements as America &apos;s president-elect , Barack Obama focused on climate change , and clearly stated both his priorities and the facts on which these priorities rest . 
Unfortunately , both are weak , or even wrong . 
Obama &apos;s policy outline was presented via video to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger &apos;s Governors &quot; Global Warming Summit , and has again been shown in Poznan , Poland , to leaders assembled to flesh out a global warming roadmap . 
According to Obama , &quot; few challenges facing America and the world are more urgent than combating climate change . &quot; 
Such a statement is now commonplace for most political leaders around the world , even though it neglects to address the question of how much we can do to help America and the world through climate policies versus other policies . 
Consider , for example , hurricanes in America . 
Clearly , a policy of reducing CO2 emissions would have had zero consequence on Katrina &apos;s devastating impact on New Orleans , where such a disaster was long expected . 
Over the next half-century , even large reductions in CO2 emissions would have only a negligible impact . 
Instead , direct policies to address New Orleans &quot; vulnerabilities could have avoided the huge and unnecessary cost in human misery and economic loss . 
These should have included stricter building codes , smarter evacuation policies , and better preservation of wetlands ( which could have reduced the ferociousness of the hurricane ) . 
Most importantly , a greater focus on upkeep and restoration of the levees could have spared the city entirely . 
Perhaps these types of preventive actions should be Obama &apos;s priority . 
Likewise , consider world hunger . 
Pleas for action on climate change reflect fears that global warming might undermine agricultural production , especially in the developing world . 
But global agricultural / economic models indicate that even under the most pessimistic assumptions , global warming would reduce agricultural production by just 1.4 % by the end of the century . 
Because agricultural output will more than double over this period , climate change would at worst cause global food production to double not in 2080 but in 2081 . 
Moreover , by implementing the Kyoto Protocol at a cost of $ 180 billion annually would keep two million people from going hungry only by the end of the century . 
Yet by spending just $ 10 billion annually , the United Nations estimates that we could help 229 million hungry people today . 
Every time spending on climate policies saves one person from hunger in a hundred years , the same amount could have saved 5,000 people now . 
Arguably , this should be among Obama &apos;s top priorities . 
Obama went on to say why he wants to prioritize global warming policies : &quot; The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear . 
Sea levels are rising . 
Coastlines are shrinking . 
We &apos;ve seen record drought , spreading famine , and storms that are growing stronger with each passing hurricane season . &quot; 
Yes , global warming is happening , and mankind is partly responsible , but these statements are - however eloquent - seriously wrong or misleading . 
Sea levels are rising , but they have been rising at least since the early 1800 &quot; s . 
In the era of satellite measurements , the rise has not accelerated ( actually we &apos;ve seen a sea-level fall over the past two years ) . 
The UN expects about a 30-centimeter sea-level rise over this century - about what we saw over the past 150 years . 
In that period , many coastlines increased , most obviously in Holland , because rich countries can easily protect and even expand their territory . 
But even for oft-cited Bangladesh , scientists just this year showed that the country grows by 20 square kilometers each year , because river sedimentation win out over rising sea levels . 
Obama &apos;s claim about record droughts similarly fails even on a cursory level - the United States has in all academic estimates been getting wetter over the century ( with the 1930 &quot; s &quot; dust bowl &quot; setting the drought high point ) . 
This is even true globally over the past half-century , as one of the most recent scientific studies of actual soil moisture shows : &quot; there is an overall small wetting trend in global soil moisture . &quot; 
Furthermore , famine has rapidly declined over the past half century . 
The main deviation has been the past two years of record-high food prices , caused not by climate change but by the policies designed to combat it : the dash for ethanol , which put food into cars and thus upward pressure on food prices . 
The World Bank estimates that this policy has driven at least 30 million more people into hunger . 
To cite policy-driven famine as an argument for more of the same policy seems unreasonable , to say the least . 
Finally , it is simply wrong to say that storms are growing stronger every hurricane season . 
Even for the Atlantic hurricane basin , which we tend to hear about the most , the total hurricane energy ( ACE ) as measured by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has declined by two-thirds since the record was set in 2005 . 
For the world , this trend has been more decisive : maximum ACE was reached in 1994 , and has plummeted for the past three years , while hurricanes around the world have for the past year been about as inactive as at any time since records began being kept . 
Global warming should be tackled , but smartly through research and development of low-carbon alternatives . 
If we are to get our policies right , it is crucial that we get our facts right .
