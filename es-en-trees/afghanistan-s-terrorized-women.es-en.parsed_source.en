Afghanistan &apos;s Terrorized Women 
KABUL - Recently , the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission ( AIHRC ) office in Kudoz province reported the rescue of a young woman who had been imprisoned in her in-laws &quot; dungeon for seven months . 
Fifteen-year-old Sahar Gul was forced to marry an older man who serves in the Afghan army . 
She was then kept in the dungeon by her husband &apos;s family and brutally tortured for months , because she refused to work as a prostitute . 
Over the past ten years , the AIHRC has received more than 19,000 complaints related to violence against women . 
Despite making some progress in investigating the complaints and referring them to the justice system , as well as in raising public awareness about the issue , the challenges remain huge . 
Since 2002 , many efforts have been made to improve women &apos;s lives in Afghanistan . 
The country has enacted several new laws and established a fairly advanced legal framework to end discrimination against women , including a new law that criminalizes any act that results in violence against women . 
But laws and policies alone are not sufficient to protect women from horrific domestic abuse . 
Indeed , the Gul case is hardly the only well-publicized case . 
There was also Gulnaz , a young woman who was jailed for adultery after being raped by a relative ( she was recently released after a presidential pardon , but may be forced to marry her attacker ) . 
The husband of another young woman , Aisha , cut off her nose and ears when she ran away . 
Violence against women in Afghanistan persists for many reasons . 
First , the country has inherited a patriarchal tribal tradition that assumes women &apos;s inferiority . 
Women are therefore deprived of their basic rights and freedoms . 
Second , there is a strong political incentive to deprive women of their rights . 
Radical groups receive immense support from the large share of the population that opposes women &apos;s rights . 
The Taliban , for example , have consistently used an anti-women policy to appeal to tribal and rural people . 
Third , family pride and honor are deemed more important than a woman &apos;s individual well-being and safety . 
For example , if family members beat or abuse a woman , she has few options . 
Often , her only choice is to remain silent or risk disgracing the family . 
If she does report the matter to the authorities , the case will almost certainly never be properly investigated , nor the perpetrators ever prosecuted . 
Gul , for example , complained to the police about her abusive in-laws , but she was returned to the family when some of their influential contacts intervened . 
Fourth , laws are often arbitrarily applied , and sharia ( Islamic law ) frequently takes precedence over civil legislation , resulting in widespread impunity for crimes of violence against women . 
For example , in October 2010 , the Afghan Supreme Court ruled that women who run away from home can be charged with prostitution , unless they go to the police or an immediate relative &apos;s home . It is this mindset that led to Gul &apos;s victimization . 
Finally , while the Taliban lost power ten years ago , discrimination and violence against women has occurred in Afghan society for centuries . 
Thus , despite some progress , public and official sensitivity to violence against women is only slowly emerging . 
The Afghan government must take several steps to protect women fully . 
Above all , perpetrators of violence against women should be prosecuted and tried under due process of law . 
This will require strengthening the rule of law and ending the prevailing culture of impunity . 
That , in turn , requires educating the public further about human rights and women &apos;s rights through school textbooks , continuing education courses , and a vigorous media campaign . 
It also requires persuading representatives and policymakers to develop policies and allocate budget revenues to combat violence against women , and training police and judges to handle cases of violence against women without deferring to claims of family honor . 
Perhaps most importantly , non-constitutional justice systems , such as sharia , must be monitored and checked , if not prohibited altogether . 
As for Sahar Gul , her case must be thoroughly investigated , and the police and judiciary must commit to bringing her torturers to justice . 
Furthermore , Gul &apos;s case , and others like it , should be studied in order to understand the roots of such crimes . 
Until Afghanistan &apos;s leaders begin to address this problem seriously , our country will continue to bear the scar of violence against women on its face .
