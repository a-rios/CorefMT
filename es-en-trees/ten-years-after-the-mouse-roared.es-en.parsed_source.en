Ten Years after the Mouse Roared 
CAMBRIDGE - Al Qaeda &apos;s attack on the United States ten years ago was a profound shock to both American and international public opinion . 
What lessons can we learn a decade later ? 
Anyone who flies or tries to visit a Washington office building gets a reminder of how American security was changed by 9 / 11 . 
But , while concern about terrorism is greater , and immigration restrictions are tighter , the hysteria of the early days after 9 / 11 has abated . 
New agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security , the Director of National Intelligence , and an upgraded Counter Terrorism Center have not transformed American government , and , for most Americans , personal freedoms have been little affected . 
No more large-scale attacks have occurred inside the US , and everyday life has recovered well . 
But this apparent return to normality should not mislead us about the longer-term importance of 9 / 11 . 
As I argue in my book The Future of Power , one of the great power shifts of this global information age is the strengthening of non-state actors . 
Al Qaeda killed more Americans on 9 / 11 than the attack by the government of Japan did at Pearl Harbor in 1941 . 
This might be called the &quot; privatization of war . &quot; 
During the Cold War , the US had been even more vulnerable , in technological terms , to a nuclear attack from Russia , but &quot; mutual assured destruction &quot; prevented the worst by keeping vulnerability more or less symmetrical . 
Russia controlled great force , but it could not acquire power over the US from its arsenal . 
Two asymmetries , however , favored Al Qaeda in September 2001 . 
First , there was an asymmetry of information . 
The terrorists had good information about their targets , while the US before September 11 had poor information about the identity and location of terrorist networks . 
Some government reports had anticipated the extent to which non-state actors could hurt large states , but their conclusions were not incorporated into official plans . 
Second , there was an asymmetry in attention . 
A larger actor &apos;s many interests and objectives often dilute its attention to a smaller actor , which , by contrast , can focus its attention and will more easily . 
There was a good deal of information about Al Qaeda in the American intelligence system , but the US was unable to process coherently the information that its various agencies had gathered . 
But asymmetries of information and attention do not confer a permanent advantage on the wielders of informal violence . 
To be sure , there is no such thing as perfect safety , and , historically , waves of terrorism have often taken a generation to recede . 
Even so , the elimination of top Al Qaeda leaders , the strengthening of American intelligence , tighter border controls , and greater cooperation between the FBI and the CIA have all clearly made the US ( and its allies ) safer . 
But there are larger lessons that 9 / 11 teaches us about the role of narrative and soft power in an information age . 
Traditionally , analysts assumed that victory went to the side with the better army or the larger force ; in an information age , the outcome is also influenced by who has the better story . 
Competing narratives matter , and terrorism is about narrative and political drama . 
The smaller actor cannot compete with the larger in terms of military might , but it can use violence to set the world agenda and construct narratives that affect its targets &quot; soft power . 
Osama bin Laden was very adept at narrative . 
He was not able to do as much damage to the US as he hoped , but he managed to dominate the world agenda for a decade , and the ineptness of the initial American reaction meant that he could impose larger costs on the US than were necessary . 
President George W. Bush made a tactical error in declaring a &quot; global war on terrorism . &quot; He would have done better to frame the response as a reply to Al Qaeda , which had declared war on the US . 
The global war on terror was misinterpreted to justify a wide variety of actions , including the misguided and expensive Iraq War , which damaged America &apos;s image . 
Moreover , many Muslims misread the term as an attack on Islam , which was not America &apos;s intent , but fit Bin Laden &apos;s efforts to tarnish perceptions of the US in key Muslim countries . 
To the extent that the trillion or more dollars of unfunded war costs contributed to the budget deficit that plagues the US today , Bin Laden was able to damage American hard power . 
And the real price of 9 / 11 may be the opportunity costs : for most of the first decade of this century , as the world economy gradually shifted its center of gravity toward Asia , the US was preoccupied with a mistaken war of choice in the Middle East . 
A key lesson of 9 / 11 is that hard military power is essential in countering terrorism by the likes of Bin Laden , but that the soft power of ideas and legitimacy is essential for winning the hearts and minds of the mainstream Muslim populations from whom Al Qaeda would like to recruit . 
A &quot; smart power &quot; strategy does not ignore the tools of soft power . 
But , at least for America , perhaps the most important lesson of 9 / 11 is that US foreign policy should follow the counsel of President Dwight Eisenhower a half-century ago : Do not get involved in land wars of occupation , and focus on maintaining the strength of the American economy .
