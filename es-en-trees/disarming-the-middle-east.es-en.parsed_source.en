Disarming the Middle East 
TEL AVIV - Israel &apos;s desperate plea that the world act to curtail what its intelligence service describes as Iran &apos;s &quot; gallop toward a nuclear bomb &quot; has not gotten the positive response that Israel expected . 
With the United Nations sanctions regime now having proven to be utterly ineffective , and with international diplomacy apparently futile in preventing the Iranians from mastering the technology for enriching uranium , Israel is being boxed into a corner . 
What was supposed to be a major international effort at mediation is deteriorating into an apocalyptic Israeli-Iranian showdown . 
This is an intriguing anomaly , for , notwithstanding Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s vile anti-Semitic rhetoric , the implications of Iran &apos;s emerging power extend far beyond the Jewish state . 
Indeed , it affects the entire Arab world , particularly the vulnerable Gulf countries , and even Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
The United States , as a major Middle East power , and Europe also have an interest in stemming the tide of nuclear proliferation that now threatens the Middle East . 
For a nuclear Iran would open the gates to an uncontrolled rush for the bomb across the region . 
The international system &apos;s failure to address effectively the nuclear issue in the Middle East stems mostly from the Russia-US divide , to which wrongheaded American strategy has contributed mightily . 
Russia cannot want a nuclear Iran . 
But in its quest for leverage against what it perceives as hostile American policies , and as way to bargain for a more acceptable security framework with the West , the Russians refuse to join America &apos;s leadership in international efforts to curtail Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
Russia holds the key not only to Iran &apos;s diplomatic isolation , but also - through the weapons transfers that it has already pledged to Iran - to the Iranian government &apos;s capacity to protect its nuclear installations . 
In October 2007 , Vladimir Putin became the first Russian leader since Leonid Brezhnev to visit Iran , bringing along five leaders of the Caspian Sea states . 
Since then , Putin has sought to expose the bankruptcy of America &apos;s policy of isolating Iran . 
Russia probably can tame the Iranian regime , but it will do so only in exchange for America &apos;s respect for its interests in the former Soviet Republics , and possibly also a revision of post-Cold War strategic agreements . 
But , even if abandoned by the Russians , it is highly unlikely that Iran will give up its nuclear ambitions unless its regional concerns are addressed . 
Iran &apos;s nuclear drive reflects a broad national consensus , the result of a deep-seated sense of vulnerability and betrayal . 
The Iranians remember how the international community remained indifferent when Saddam Hussein attacked with chemical weapons in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Iran believes that it is the victim of an international double standard - acceptance of Pakistan &apos;s and India &apos;s nuclear status , not to mention Israel &apos;s - which only fuels its sense of discrimination and its resolve to pursue its ambitions . 
By exposing the inadequacy of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , Iran , a signatory , has signaled to Israel that the regional order can no longer be based on Israel &apos;s nuclear monopoly as a non-NPT member . 
Hence , the solution lies not only in forcing NPT members like Iran and Syria to comply with their commitments , but in creating a broader regional security and cooperation architecture in the Middle East . 
But it is highly unlikely that the Arabs will agree to such a system so long as Israel refuses to address her own nuclear capabilities . 
Any regional security architecture will have to be premised on the Middle East becoming a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons . 
The Middle East retains the infamous distinction of being the only region in the world to have used such weapons since the end of World War II . 
Indeed , Arab states have both developed and used chemical and biological weapons - not against Israel , so far , but against others in the region . 
Iraq used them against Iran , Egypt in its war in Yemen of the 1970 &quot; s , and Iraq against its own Kurds . 
In 1993 , Israel signed the international treaty banning chemical weapons , but did not ratify it because of the Arab states &quot; refusal to follow suit as long as Israel maintained its nuclear advantage . 
The international community must recognize that the Middle East security equation is not a simple linear one involving Israel versus the Arab world . 
The proliferation of nuclear weapons in a region that has seen fit to use weapons of mass destruction before threatens everyone . 
So a concerted effort is needed by outside powers such as the US and Russia , not to act as spoilers of each other &apos;s policies in the region , but to create a WMD-free zone . 
Such a regional system cannot be built in a political vacuum . 
A major effort to assist in the solution of the region &apos;s major political disputes is a vital prerequisite . 
The nuclear clock is ticking .
