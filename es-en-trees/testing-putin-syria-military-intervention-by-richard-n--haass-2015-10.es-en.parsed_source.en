Testing Putin in Syria 
NEW YORK - There has been no shortage of scrutiny of what Russian President Vladimir Putin is up to in Syria and why . 
Much of the analysis , though , has been narrowly focused on the short term and may be too negative in assessing his actions &quot; likely long-term consequences . 
What we know is that Putin has decided to come to the aid of Bashar al-Assad &apos;s embattled regime . 
Russian bombs and missiles are now raining down on an array of armed groups that have been fighting Syrian government forces , which has given the regime the breathing space that Russia &apos;s intervention was intended to provide . 
As bad as the Assad government is , and as much as it has to answer for , this outcome is arguably preferable in the short run to the regime &apos;s collapse . 
The painful truth in Syria today is that a government implosion would most likely lead to genocide , millions more displaced people , and the establishment of the Islamic State &apos;s so-called caliphate in Damascus . 
Putin &apos;s motives are a matter of speculation , but it would appear that he did not want to see Russia &apos;s long-term ally in the Middle East fall . 
Moreover , he never misses an opportunity to remind the world that Russia remains a major power , able and willing to act on behalf of its perceived interests . 
It is also possible that he sought to distract domestic attention from a shrinking economy and the rising cost of intervention in Ukraine . 
Putin &apos;s high approval ratings suggest he may well be succeeding . 
Many fear that Russia &apos;s latest activism will not only prolong Syria &apos;s brutal civil war , but also strengthen the Islamic State . 
This could well turn out to be the case , as hatred of the Assad regime is a major recruiting tool . 
Indeed , there have been reports of the Islamic State moving into areas that others have abandoned following Russian attacks . 
Russia seems to be playing the same cynical game as Assad : framing the war as a binary choice between the Islamic State and a regime that , however flawed , still deserves the world &apos;s support . 
Some also fear that this demonstration of Russian assertiveness presages a new wave of such interventions , even a new Cold War . 
It is also not clear that the Russian people are prepared to pay a high price for such a foreign policy . 
So it all comes down to Putin , who enjoys a degree of autonomy in Kremlin decision-making not seen since the Stalin era . 
Putin is widely known to be a martial-arts enthusiast , and his action in Syria is entirely consistent with many of the discipline &apos;s principles , including the importance of the decisive thrust that neutralizes the opponent &apos;s strengths and exploits his weaknesses . 
But force has its limits . 
Russia &apos;s intervention in Syria cannot succeed if success is defined as enabling the Assad government to regain control over the bulk of the country &apos;s territory . 
Putin &apos;s policy can , at most , establish a relatively secure enclave . 
Even this modest aim will prove costly , because the Islamic State is also becoming stronger . 
And it could prove expensive to Russia itself : it is only a matter of time before suicide bombings ( such as the recent attack in Ankara ) occur in Moscow . 
The real question , then , is whether Putin sees bolstering the Assad government as an end in itself or as a means to an end . 
If it is the latter - if Putin is thinking in terms of chess , the preferred game of many Russians , and planning several moves ahead - a diplomatic process , in which Assad is removed at some point , is conceivable . 
Russia might support such a process ; after all , Putin is not known for his sentimentality . 
Indeed , he might embrace a political process that enabled him to demonstrate Russia &apos;s central role in shaping the future of the Middle East . 
In the meantime , the United States and others should pursue a two-track policy . 
One track would channel steps to improve the balance of power on the ground in Syria . 
Relatively safe enclaves should emerge from this effort . 
A Syria of enclaves or cantons may be the best possible outcome for now and the foreseeable future . 
Neither the US nor anyone else has a vital national interest in restoring a Syrian government that controls all of the country &apos;s territory ; what is essential is to roll back the Islamic State and similar groups . 
The second track is a political process in which the US and other governments remain open to Russian ( and even Iranian ) participation . 
The goal would be to ease Assad out of power and establish a successor government that , at a minimum , enjoyed the support of his Alawite base and , ideally , some Sunnis . 
Such a process might well confer prestige on Putin . 
That would be a price worth paying if it contributed to a dynamic that over time reduced both the suffering of the Syrian people and the danger posed by the Islamic State .
