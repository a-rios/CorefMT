The Emperor &apos;s New Goal 
NEW DELHI - Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko , in a rare overseas trip , are scheduled to begin a tour of the Indian cities of New Delhi and Chennai on November 30 . 
The imperial couple &apos;s weeklong visit is likely to mark a defining moment in Indo-Japanese relations , fostering closer economic and security ties between Asia &apos;s two leading democracies as they seek a pluralistic , stable Asian order . 
Traditionally , a visit from the Japanese emperor - except for a coronation or royal anniversary celebration - signified a turning point in a bilateral relationship . 
While the emperor is merely the &quot; symbol of the state &quot; under Japan &apos;s US-imposed postwar constitution , he retains significant influence , owing to Japanese veneration of the imperial dynasty - the world &apos;s oldest continuous hereditary monarchy , the origins of which can be traced to 660 BC . 
Indeed , the emperor &apos;s overseas visits remain deeply political , setting the tone - if not the agenda - for Japan &apos;s foreign policy . 
Consider Akihito &apos;s 1992 visit to China - the first such visit by any Japanese emperor . 
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping &apos;s government - grateful for Japan &apos;s reluctance to maintain punitive sanctions over the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and eager for international recognition , not to mention Japanese capital and commercial technologies - had extended seven invitations over two years . 
Akihito &apos;s trip , which came at the height of Japan &apos;s pro-China foreign policy , was followed by increased Japanese aid , investment , and technology transfer , thereby cementing Japan &apos;s role in China &apos;s economic rise . 
The improved diplomatic relationship lasted until the recent flare-up of territorial and other bilateral disputes . 
Although no Japanese emperor has visited India before , the bilateral relationship runs deep . 
In traditional Japanese culture , India is Tenjiku ( the country of heaven ) . 
Today , Japan is India &apos;s largest source of aid and has secured a key role in supporting infrastructure development , financing projects like the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor , the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor , and the Bangalore Metro Rail Project . 
With these natural allies seeking to add strategic bulk to their rapidly multiplying ties , Akihito &apos;s tour is the most significant visit to India by any foreign leader in recent years . 
Indeed , it is expected to be one of the last foreign trips for the 79-year-old emperor , who has undergone several major surgeries in the past decade . 
Akihito &apos;s travel schedule contrasts sharply with that of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . 
Despite having had open-heart surgery during his first term , India &apos;s 81-year-old leader has sought to offset his low domestic political stock by flying more than one million kilometers on overseas trips - including visits to Japan , China , Indonesia , Russia , Thailand , and the United States in the last six months alone . 
The paradox of Akihito &apos;s tour - for which Singh has appointed a special envoy with ministerial rank to oversee preparations - is that Japan is investing substantial political capital to build a strong , long-term partnership with India &apos;s government at a time when India is gripped by policy paralysis . 
Japan &apos;s leaders are perhaps counting on the continuity of India &apos;s strategic policies , which would require the Indian government that emerges from next year &apos;s general election to sustain the momentum of cooperation . 
But , more important , Japan is adjusting to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing regional environment , characterized by rising geopolitical competition with China . 
In a historical reversal , Japan has found itself on the defensive against the increasingly muscular foreign policy of its former colony and old rival . 
This situation is forcing the Japanese government to reconsider its postwar pacifism , revise its defense strategy , and increase its military spending . 
In this context , Japan knows that a deeper strategic collaboration with India - which is also seeking to blunt increasing military pressure from China - is its best move . 
In modern history , Japan has had the distinction of consistently staying ahead of the rest of Asia . 
During the Meiji era , in the second half of the nineteenth century , it became the first Asian country to modernize . 
It was also the first Asian country to emerge as a world power , defeating Manchu-ruled China and Czarist Russia in separate wars . 
And after its defeat in World War II , Japan rose from the ashes to become Asia &apos;s first global economic powerhouse . 
With per capita GDP of more than $ 37,000 , Japan still ranks among the world &apos;s richest countries , specializing in the highest-value links of global supply chains . 
And income inequality in Japan ranks among the lowest in Asia . 
Nonetheless , almost two decades of economic stagnation have eroded Japan &apos;s regional clout . 
This raises the question of whether Japan &apos;s current problems -sluggish growth , high public debt , and rapid population aging - presage a similar trend across East Asia . 
Similar problems are already appearing in South Korea , while China has been driven to loosen its one-child policy and unveil plans for economic reforms aimed at reviving growth . 
For India , Japan is indispensable as both an economic and a security partner . 
It is central to India &apos;s &quot; Look East &quot; policy , which has evolved into more of an &quot; Act East &quot; policy , whereby the original strategy &apos;s economic logic has been amplified by the larger geopolitical objective of ensuring Asian stability and a regional balance of power . 
It is in this light that Akihito &apos;s historic visit should be viewed .
