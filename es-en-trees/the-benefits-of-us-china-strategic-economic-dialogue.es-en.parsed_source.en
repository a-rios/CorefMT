The Benefits of US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue 
In recognition of the importance and complexity of the US-China economic relationship , in September 2006 President George W. Bush and President Hu Jintao created the &quot; Strategic Economic Dialogue &quot; between our countries . 
Their intent was not to replace the many economic dialogues already taking place , but to create a senior-level forum that was both comprehensive and strategic . 
A forum that would also build trust on both sides by demonstrating progress on the immediate issues we face . 
The SED has made substantial progress in achieving these goals . 
The US and China have built stronger relationships and established constructive channels of communication that didn &apos;t previously exist . 
These innovations have helped keep the US-China economic relationship on an even keel , even in times of tension . 
Because we have a framework for high-level discussions , we can - and do - pick up the phone and talk . 
The SED meeting next week in Beijing will focus on five areas : integrity of trade and product safety ; balanced economic development , including financial sector reform ; energy efficiency and security ; environmental sustainability ; and bilateral investment . 
The meeting comes at a delicate time , as a new group of leaders moves into China &apos;s senior positions , and as the agenda has been broadened to include food and product safety , energy efficiency and security , and environmental sustainability . 
These issues carry deep implications for economic ties . 
Consumers need to have confidence in the safety of the products they purchase , whether produced at home or abroad . 
China &apos;s management of food and product safety issues will have a long-term impact on trade relations , the sustainability of China &apos;s growth strategy , and its further integration into the global trading system . 
US and Chinese government agencies are working together to address these issues . 
Likewise , for both our countries , greater energy efficiency and security requires reliance upon market price signals , technology , innovation , and diversified energy sources . 
The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership , clean coal development through FutureGen , and industrial efficiency audits represent some of the most productive areas of ongoing cooperation . 
We also encourage China &apos;s active participation in the Major Economies Meeting efforts to develop a post-2012 framework for greenhouse-gas reduction . 
I was pleased to see that a large Chinese energy company , Shanghai Electric , recently indicated public support for substantial reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions . 
One pressing issue - for the US , China , and the global economy - is China &apos;s move to a more flexible exchange-rate policy . 
China is reforming its policy , as a part of a move to a more market-determined exchange rate . 
In the past year , the RMB has appreciated by 6 % , but the pace is not fast enough to reduce China &apos;s global trade surplus , its internal imbalances , or foreign-exchange-market pressures . 
A more flexible currency is especially important now , when inflation risks are rising in China . 
Increased currency flexibility would allow China &apos;s central bank to use monetary policy to enhance China &apos;s financial and price stability . 
As Premier Wen Jiabao recently emphasized , China must now undertake comprehensive measures to control mounting inflation , growing asset bubbles , and an overheating economy . 
We share these concerns . 
In the US-China relationship , the RMB exchange rate has become a touchstone for broader anxieties about competition from China . 
As globalization advances and economies become more tightly integrated , worries about the effects of foreign competition - through trade or through foreign investment - have fueled economic nationalism and protectionist sentiments . 
Americans have been through this type of debate before . 
Twenty years ago , we were gripped by fear that Japan would overtake our economic leadership - a concern that was unfounded then and , in hindsight , looks profoundly mistaken . 
America continues to lead the world in standard of living , productivity , and innovation . 
China &apos;s continued economic growth and integration into the global economy gives America even greater opportunities to grow and succeed . 
The biggest risk to both US and Chinese prosperity is that China &apos;s growth stalls , or that it pulls back from further global integration and reforms too slowly . 
Indeed , economic nationalism is growing in China , too . 
Some Chinese are suspicious that the US push for RMB appreciation and financial-market liberalization is really an attempt to gain trade advantages and generate profits for American companies while slowing China &apos;s economic expansion . 
They mistakenly believe that yen appreciation during the mid-1980 &quot; s caused Japan &apos;s weak economic performance in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Rather , we now know that Japan &apos;s economic difficulties were caused by the growth , and then collapse , of a huge asset bubble , and the failure to use monetary policy to prevent deflation after the bubble burst . 
Financial liberalization is not about foreign firms drilling holes in China &apos;s economy . 
Foreign participation in the financial sector brings expertise needed to provide more efficient savings instruments , risk management , and allocation of capital . 
But to use that expertise - the most valuable asset a globally competitive financial institution has - investors need to control the operations of firms in which they have a stake . 
This is why China &apos;s equity limits for foreign investment in Chinese financial institutions are costly to the Chinese economy , and why raising these limits is important . 
There are also those in China who argue that the US focus on food and product safety is part of a strategy to restrict Chinese imports and reduce the bilateral trade deficit . This argument has no basis in fact . 
Numerous other countries , notably European Union members , share our concerns . 
Finally , after welcoming foreign investment , which contributed greatly to Chinese manufacturing growth and export competitiveness , some in China would now tighten restrictions on foreign investment to protect China &apos;s domestic industries . 
The US faces similar pressures , even though we are one of the world &apos;s most open economies . 
I am committed to working to maintain economic openness , because it is good for America and for our workers . 
The SED is one valuable tool in combating protectionist sentiments . 
We supported China &apos;s membership in the World Trade Organization , the Inter-American Development Bank and the Financial Action Task Force . 
We supported a greater voting share for China , and other rapidly growing emerging markets , in the IMF and the World Bank . 
But China &apos;s government must recognize that , while increased participation allows China to advance its interests , it also brings greater responsibilities . 
The agreements we have achieved thus far are like signposts showing progress along the road to mutual economic prosperity . 
While progress has not been as rapid as we would like , these signposts point the way to further benefits for Americans and Chinese alike . 
To turn back would jeopardize the long-term strategic interests of both countries for short-term political expediency .
