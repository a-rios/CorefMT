Does Islam Threaten Democracy ? 
Is Islam incompatible with multicultural democracy ? 
Many people point to the fact that few Muslim societies are democratic and conclude that Islam must be inherently undemocratic . 
They point to Muslim rhetoric suffused with hatred of the West , and deduce that Muslims cannot be good citizens of Western democracies . 
Britain , with around 1.6 million Muslims in a population of 58.7 million , provides an excellent place to test these notions . 
Three quarters of British Muslims come from the Indian subcontinent , mainly rural Pakistan and Bangladesh . 
This is important because some of their difficulties in settlement arise not from religion but from unfamiliarity with modern life . 
So far , Britain has seen only four Muslim riots , compared to about eight race-related riots by Afro-Caribbeans . 
One concerned Salman Rushdie &apos;s novel The Satanic Verses ; the others were triggered by police insensitivity and white racist marches . 
With the qualified exception of the first , all riots were local , relatively minor , and lasted barely a day or two . 
So Britain &apos;s Muslims have presented no major problems of law and order . 
But Muslims &apos; presence in British society has presented other challenges . 
One is a &quot; clash of practices , &quot; including demands for Halal meat for Muslim schoolchildren , Muslim dress , prayer time , female circumcision , polygamy , and arranged marriages . 
Female circumcision and polygamy are banned , and Muslims accept this . 
Muslims also generally respect &quot; Western values &quot; such as equality , freedom of expression , tolerance , peaceful resolution of differences , and respect for majority decisions . 
Indeed , equality among races is an important Muslim value and practice . 
Equality of the sexes poses the gravest difficulties - particularly because Muslim girls in Britain increasingly assert it . 
Similarly , after some theological debate , British Muslims have widely accepted that they owe unreserved loyalty to Britain . 
However there is some ambiguity about what they should do when the claims of the state clash with those of the umma ( the worldwide community of Islam ) . 
For example , Muslims objected to the 1991 war against Iraq , but did not mount public protests . 
The government urged the country to respect Muslims &apos; &quot; understandable sympathies for their fellow-religionists , &quot; and tensions were avoided . 
A small number of young Muslims later fought with the Taliban . 
But most British Muslims condemned them , insisting on loyalty to Britain . 
Most Muslims also approved when the police raided and confiscated weapons at the Finsbury Park mosque in London , whose Imam had long preached hatred of the West and support for terrorists . 
Moreover , Muslims eagerly participate in public affairs , voting at a rate not much different from the rest of the population . 
There are 150 local Muslim councillors and eight mayors , slightly fewer than other ethnic minorities , but not alarmingly so . 
There are four Muslims in the House of Lords and three in the House of Commons , more than for some other ethnic minorities . 
Indeed , in formal and informal ways , Islam is increasingly interpreted in a manner that brings it closer to the central values of British democracy . 
A distinctively British brand of Islam is beginning to emerge , just as France , Germany , the Netherlands , and Spain are producing their own forms of Islam . 
&quot; British &quot; Islam obviously clashes with some aspects of the Islam with which immigrants arrived . 
But religion does not operate in a vacuum . 
Its influence is mediated by many other factors . 
When Muslims find themselves living in democracies , they adjust . 
Political survival is one reason : when in a minority , the option of pressing for an Islamic state , with all its undemocratic potential is closed . 
Others welcome the opportunity in a democracy to pursue legitimate interests , and even to protest . 
The main problem for Muslims is not democracy , but coping with a multicultural society . 
Muslims are convinced of the absolute superiority of Islam , which is reflected in the constant invocation and desperate desire to revive past glory , as well as a positive duty to convert followers of other religions . 
They may marry non-Muslims , but do not allow others to marry their women , and expect those marrying within Islam to convert to it . 
This cannot be attributed to the current widespread feeling among Muslims that their identity is under threat . 
Even in the self-confident Ottoman Empire , where Jews and Christians enjoyed considerable tolerance , followers of these religions were second-class citizens . 
While free to convert to Islam , they were forbidden to convert Muslims or marry their women . 
Muslim attitudes towards multiculturalism are consequently one-sided . 
They welcome it because it gives them the freedom to retain their religious identity and to familiarize others with their beliefs . 
But they resent it because it denies their superiority and exposes them and their children to other religions and secular cultures . 
Islam and Europe have long shaped one another &apos;s cultural identity . 
Each has been the other &apos;s &quot; other , &quot; and their sometimes friendly , sometimes hostile , relations have bonded them more deeply than either realizes . 
But with the exception of Spain and parts of Eastern Europe , they have until very recently interacted at a distance and outside Europe &apos;s boundaries . 
They now need to find new ways of coexisting and cultivating civic amity . 
Britain &apos;s experience shows that there are strong reasons for optimism .
