The Nobel Prize and Einstein \ u0027s Ghost 
This December 10 th marks the one hundredth anniversary of when the first Nobel Prizes were awarded . 
Ever since , they have been a subject of great interest and debate . 
Alfred Nobel died on 10 December 1896 . 
When his will was opened it was found that he had donated his considerable wealth to creating the prizes that bear his name . 
Five prizes were mentioned : physics , chemistry , physiology or medicine , literature and peace ; and four prize-awarding institutions named : the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ( for physics and chemistry ) , the Karolinska Institutet ( for physiology or medicine ) , the Swedish Academy ( for literature ) and a group appointed by the Norwegian Parliament , later called &quot; The Norwegian Nobel Committee &quot; ( for peace ) . 
Sweden and Norway were then tied together in a union . 
Since the creation of the Nobel prizes , more than 650 medals and diplomas have been given away in the original prize areas . 
A prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel was established by the Bank of Sweden in 1968 . 
Most of these prizes are connected with scientific breakthroughs , literary masterpieces and attempts to make peace in a violent century . 
The thread running though all the stories of the prize winners is the concept of creativity : both individual creativity and creative environments . 
One story - that of a Nobel Laureate in Physics , Albert Einstein - is particularly explicative of the process . 
Perhaps the most common question about the Nobel Prize in Physics is this : &quot; Why didn &apos;t Einstein get the prize for his theory of relativity ? &quot; 
At the age of 26 , during his &quot; annus mirabulis &quot; of 1905 , Einstein published three papers that were to influence the entire 20 th century , not only in physics . 
One of these papers concerned the special theory of relativity , which describes how space and time , or mass and energy , are mixed at high speeds . 
One paper describes the &quot; Brownian motion , &quot; the irregular motion performed by small particles in a liquid as a result of their collisions with the liquid molecules . 
The third paper , finally , explains the photo-electric effect , why light can make electricity leave metal surfaces , something we apply in ordinary photocells . 
Of the three theories , the theory of relativity became the most written about and discussed . 
When the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences year after year asked scientists for their nominations , many answered that Einstein deserved the Nobel Prize in Physics for his special theory of relativity . 
But the Nobel Committee for Physics didn &apos;t agree , and for years no prize was awarded to Einstein ! 
At first the Nobel Committee argued that the theory might be wrong and wrote that it would be best to wait for experimental evidence that confirmed Einstein &apos;s theory . 
When Einstein managed to generalise his theory and introduced the curved space-time , in which light bends around heavy astronomical bodies , the number of nominations increased even more . 
But the Nobel Committee for Physics had a powerful member , Allvar Gullstrand , professor at Uppsala University and Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine 1911 for his work on how the light bends in the eye . 
In his opinion , Einstein was wrong , and he tried to prove it by making his own calculations . 
Today , we know that Gullstrand was wrong , but his opposition was enough to block the prize-awarding process . 
In Uppsala , however , another professor , Carl Wilhelm Oseen , a specialist on mathematical physics , understood Einstein &apos;s theories and had also understood the power balance in the Nobel Committee for Physics . 
As a newly elected member of the Academy , in 1921 he was the first to propose giving to Einstein a Nobel Prize for his work on the photoelectric effect . 
This single nomination made the wheels begin to turn in Einstein &apos;s favor . 
Oseen was made a member of the Nobel Committee and wrote a positive report on the theory of the photoelectric effect . 
The very next year , Albert Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot; for his services to Theoretical Physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect . &quot; 
So was the Royal Academy of Sciences mistaken in not giving its award of a Nobel Prize to Einstein for what most people would consider his most important intellectual discovery ? 
Many have argued that this is the case . 
But one has to study a little bit more history of physics before making the final judgment . 
In this history it is clear that Einstein &apos;s paper from 1905 not only explained the photoelectric effect , but also initiated something of a greater magnitude , something revolutionary : it introduced the concept of the photon , the wave-particle which not only lies at the heart of our understanding of both micro- and macrocosmos , but which led to technical applications such as medical laser scalpels and the laser diodes of the Internet . 
With regard to the text of Alfred Nobel &apos;s will , which requires that a Nobel Laureate confer the greatest benefit on mankind , Einstein &apos;s introduction of the photon by far surpasses the theory of relativity ! 
Today the work of the five Nobel Committees goes on , mainly along the same lines as at the beginning of the 20 th century . 
The big difference is the number of nominations , which today tend to run in the several hundreds . 
If a new Albert Einstein is hidden somewhere among the hundreds of candidates , only the future will tell !
