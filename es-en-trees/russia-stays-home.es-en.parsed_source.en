Russia Stays Home 
MADRID - Just three days before his return to the Kremlin as Russia &apos;s president , Vladimir Putin met behind closed doors at his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo , outside Moscow , with US National Security Adviser Tom Donilon , who was there to transmit President Barack Obama &apos;s renewed determination to strengthen cooperation with Russia . 
But Donilon returned home empty-handed : Putin will attend neither the G-8 summit on May 18-19 at Camp David , nor the NATO summit in Chicago on May 20-21 , despite Obama &apos;s effort to accommodate Russia by moving the G-8 summit from Chicago . 
As a result , what would have been the first meeting between Obama and Putin after his return to the Russian presidency has been postponed until the G-20 summit in Los Cabos , Mexico , set for June 18-19 . 
This delay has provoked much speculation . 
Some point as a cause of Putin &apos;s absence to recent tensions between Russia and the United States arising from Putin &apos;s increasingly harsh response to the protests by his opponents at home . 
Others suggest that Putin &apos;s aloofness stems from Kremlin infighting . 
Whatever may be driving Putin &apos;s behavior , this month &apos;s two summits will affect relations between the two countries considerably , given the global security issues to be discussed by the G-8 and the need to arrange for Russia &apos;s participation in NATO &apos;s anti-missile shield . 
Two matters - besides the shaky global economy - are especially important for the G-8 summit . 
First , Iran &apos;s nuclear program is now on the diplomatic front burner . 
After more than a year of deadlock , negotiations resumed in April . 
Russia , as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , participates in these talks , and its cooperation is essential to resolving one of today &apos;s most vexing international problems . 
Much the same can be said of Russia &apos;s role in resolving the crisis in Syria , owing to the strategic relationship that the two countries have maintained since the Cold War . 
Indeed , with the growing possibility that former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan &apos;s peace plan for Syria might fail , and that civil war might erupt , Russia could be the international community &apos;s only effective interlocutor left . 
In addition , it is essential to align the positions of Russia and the West on the anti-missile shield system now being developed by NATO , which will be a subject for discussion in Chicago . 
The principal aim of the system is to protect Europe and the US from possible attacks by short- and medium-range ballistic missiles from Iran and North Korea . 
But Russian leaders are skeptical about the true objectives of a shield , believing that it would undermine Russia &apos;s security by curtailing the retaliatory ( and thus deterrent ) capacity of its nuclear missiles . 
In 2009 , the &quot; approach by stages of adaptation &quot; launched by Obama seemed to ease bilateral tensions and prepared the way for the 2010 New START arms-reduction treaty , in which Russia and the US took a strategic leap to cut the number of nuclear-missile launchers by half . 
Following on this progress , at the end of 2010 , the Russians agreed to study the possibility of cooperating with NATO on anti-missile defense . 
But the US was unable to offer legal - not just political - guarantees that an anti-missile system based in Europe would not obstruct Russia &apos;s strategic potential . 
As a result , Russia is now so mistrustful that its military chief of staff , General Nikolai Makarov , recently declared that his country would not rule out pre-emptive attacks to destroy any part of the anti-missile shield that it views as a threat to its own security . 
One of the main arguments for this posture was Russia &apos;s uncertainty about whether later steps in the &quot; approach by stages of adaptation &quot; might be a threat to its strategic ballistic missiles . 
Moreover , Russia opposes the deployment of military facilities in countries - like Romania - that joined NATO after 1999 , a point made recently by former US ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer of the Brookings Institution . 
In view of the seriousness of the questions under consideration at the two summits , Putin &apos;s presence would have been helpful . 
In addition to the inherent value of improving the personal chemistry between leaders , reducing tensions in the relationship between Russia and the West has become indispensable , given that negotiations over the missile shield , Iran , Syria , and other issues are bound to be long - and that the solutions are linked . 
Indeed , acceptable solutions today would open the way for an unprecedented nuclear-arms agreement in 2013 . 
This is a matter of major importance , for which a good understanding between Russia and the US is essential . 
We must do everything within our power to realize Donilon &apos;s proposal to Putin to , in essence , &quot; reset the reset &quot; and bridge the gap between the two countries concerning the future disposition of their nuclear arsenals . 
For Obama , success would vindicate the Nobel Peace Prize that he was awarded in 2009 .
