A Grand Bargain with Iran 
The specter of a nuclear Iran haunts Arabs and Israelis alike , but it is the United States and Israel that are the driving force behind efforts to curtail Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
The America-Iran-Israel triangle is where the clue to the problem and its possible solution lie . 
Though Ayatollah Khomeini &apos;s Islamic revolution in 1979 disrupted Israel &apos;s old alliance with Iran , the two countries continued to conduct business with America &apos;s blessing . 
The Iran-Contra affair of the 1980 &quot; s , through which Israel supplied arms to the Islamic Republic in its war against Iraq is a case in point . 
Israel and Iran , two non-Arab powers in a hostile Arab environment , shared fundamental interests that the Islamic revolution could not change . 
It was during Yitzhak Rabin &apos;s government in the early 1990 &quot; s that Israel and Iran entered into open conflict , owing to the changing strategic environment after America &apos;s victory in the first Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
The US-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace process , which produced a series of breathtaking achievements - the Madrid peace conference , the Oslo accords , Israel &apos;s peace agreement with Jordan , a near-rapprochement with Syria , and Israel &apos;s inroads into Arab states from Morocco to Qatar - was an increasingly isolated Iran &apos;s worst nightmare . 
It was at that crossroads that Israel and Iran , two powers vying for mastery in a rapidly changing Middle East , chose to cast their strategic competition in ideological terms . 
The conflict was now between Israel , a beacon of democracy fighting the expansion of a Shiite obscurantist empire , and an Iran that chose to protect its revolution by mobilizing the Arab masses in the name of Islamic values and against treacherous rulers who had betrayed the dispossessed Palestinians . 
More an enemy of Israeli-Arab reconciliation than of Israel as such , the Mullahs &quot; resort to an incendiary anti-Jewish , pan-Islamic discourse is aimed at ending Iran &apos;s isolation and presenting its regional ambitions in a light palatable to the Sunni masses . 
In an Arab Middle East , Iran is the natural enemy ; in an Islamic world , Iran is a potential leader . 
Ironically , Iran has been the main supporter of Arab democracy , for the best way to undermine the incumbent regimes is to promote popularly based Islamist movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon , the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt , Hamas in Palestine , and the Shiite majority in Iraq . 
Yitzhak Rabin believed that an Israeli-Arab peace could prevent a nuclear Iran , but now his nightmare seems rapidly approaching . 
As an anti-status quo power , Iran is not pursuing nuclear capabilities in order to destroy Israel , but to gain prestige and influence in a hostile environment and as a shield for its challenge to the regional order . 
But Israel has every reason to be concerned , for a nuclear Iran would undermine the promise of Zionism to secure a Jewish refuge - the core rationale of Israel &apos;s own strategy of &quot; nuclear ambiguity &quot; - and would embolden its enemies throughout the region . 
It would also trigger uncontrolled regional nuclear proliferation , with Saudi Arabia and Egypt leading the way . 
A military attack on Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities is too dangerous , and its results uncertain . 
Nor is it clear that the split within the Iranian elite between revolutionary purists and those with a merchant-class mentality would lead to regime change any time soon . 
However , being radical does not necessarily mean being irrational , and revolutionary Iran has given frequent proof of its pragmatism . 
In the American-Iranian equation it was the US , not Iran , that conducted rigid ideological diplomacy . 
Iran backed the US during the first Gulf War , but was left out of the Madrid peace conference . 
Iran also supported America in its war to depose the Taliban in Afghanistan . 
The Iranians also pledged to stop obstructing the Israeli-Arab peace process . 
But , neo-conservative haughtiness - &quot; We don &apos;t speak to evil &quot; - ruled out a pragmatic response to Iran &apos;s demarche . 
Iran &apos;s mood changed by the time America &apos;s entire Middle East strategy had gone adrift , but the grand bargain remains the only viable way out of the impasse . 
This would not be achieved , however , through an inevitably imperfect sanctions regime , or by America &apos;s resort to Cold War logic aimed at breaking Iran &apos;s backbone by drawing it into a ruinous arms race . 
Iran &apos;s growing regional influence does not stem from its military expenditures , which are far lower than those of its enemies , but from its challenge to America and Israel through an astute use of soft power . 
There is no better way to undercut Iran &apos;s regional strategy of destabilization than a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace , accompanied by massive investments in human development , and followed by an internationally sponsored system of peace and security in a verifiably nuclear-free Middle East , including Israel .
