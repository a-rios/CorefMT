The Bubble of American Supremacy 
As American and British troops prepare to invade Iraq , public opinion in these countries does not support war without UN authorization . 
The rest of the world is overwhelmingly opposed to war . 
Yet Saddam Hussein is regarded as a tyrant who needs to be disarmed , and the UN Security Council unanimously passed resolution 1441 which demanded that Saddam destroy his weapons of mass-destruction . 
What caused this disconnect ? 
Iraq is the first instance when the Bush doctrine is being applied and it is provoking an allergic reaction . 
The Bush doctrine is built on two pillars : first , the US will do everything in its power to maintain its unquestioned military supremacy and , second , the US arrogates the right to preemptive action . 
These pillars support two classes of sovereignty : American sovereignty , which takes precedence over international treaties and obligations ; and the sovereignty of all other states . 
This is reminiscent of George Orwell &apos;s Animal Farm : all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others . 
To be sure , the Bush doctrine is not stated starkly ; it is buried in Orwellian doublespeak . 
The doublespeak is needed because the doctrine contradicts American values . 
The Bush administration believes that international relations are relations of power ; legality and legitimacy are mere decorations . 
This belief is not false but it exaggerates one aspect of reality to the exclusion of others . 
The aspect it stresses is military power . 
But no empire could ever be held together by military power alone . 
Yet that belief guides the Bush administration . 
Prime Minister Sharon of Israel shares the same belief and look where that has led . 
The idea that might is right cannot be reconciled with the idea of an open society . 
Hence the need for Orwellian doublespeak . 
But nobody is in possession of the ultimate truth . 
Those who make such claims are bound to be wrong at times , and so can enforce their claims only by coercion and repression . 
Bush makes no allowance for the possibility that he may be wrong , and he tolerates no dissent . 
If you are not with us , you are with the terrorists , he proclaims . 
Of course , the presence of extremist views in the executive branch does not make America a totalitarian state . 
The principles of open society are enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the institutions of American democracy are protected by the Constitution . 
There are checks and balances , and the President must obtain the support of the people . 
Nevertheless , the Bush doctrine could do untold harm before it is abandoned - as eventually it will be . 
I see parallels between the Bush administration &apos;s pursuit of American supremacy and a boom-bust process or bubble in the stock market . 
Bubbles do not arise out of thin air . 
They have a solid basis in reality , but misconception distorts reality . 
Here , the dominant position of the US is the reality , the pursuit of American supremacy the misconception . 
For a while , reality reinforces the misconception , but eventually the gap between reality and its false interpretation becomes unsustainable . 
During the self-reinforcing phase , the misconception may be tested and when a test is successful the misconception is reinforced . 
This widens the gap , leading to an eventual reversal . 
The later it comes , the more devastating the consequences . 
There seems to be an inexorable quality about this , but a boom-bust process can be aborted at any stage . 
Most stock market booms are aborted long before the extremes reached by the recent bull market . 
The sooner this happens , the better . 
That is how I view the Bush administration &apos;s pursuit of American supremacy . 
The Bush administration came into office with an ideology based on market fundamentalism and military supremacy . 
Prior to September 11 th , it could not make much headway in implementing its ideology because it lacked a clear mandate and defined enemy . 
Terrorism provided the ideal enemy because it is invisible and never disappears . 
By declaring war on terrorism , President Bush gained the domestic mandate he lacked . 
But his policies have already caused severe unintended consequences . 
The EU and NATO are divided . 
The US is perceived as a giant bully throwing its weight around . 
Afghanistan has been liberated , but law and order has not been established beyond Kabul . 
Indeed , President Karzai must be protected by American bodyguards . 
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict festers . 
Beyond Iraq an even more dangerous threat looms in North Korea - a crisis precipitated by President Bush in his eagerness to break with what he deemed to be Clinton &apos;s appeasement . 
Bush repudiated the sunshine policy introduced by President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and included North Korea in the axis of evil . 
Rapid victory in Iraq with little loss of life could bring about a dramatic change in the overall situation . 
Oil prices could fall , stock markets could celebrate , consumers could resume spending , and business could step up capital expenditures . 
America would end its dependency on Saudi oil , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could become more tractable and negotiations could start with North Korea without loss of face . 
That is what Bush counts on . 
But military victory in Iraq is the easy part . 
It is what comes after that gives pause . 
In a boom-bust process , passing an early test tends to reinforce the misconception which gave rise to it . 
That is to be feared here . 
It is not too late to prevent the boom-bust process from getting out of hand . 
The UN could accede to Chief Inspector Blix &apos;s request for several months to complete his inspections . 
America &apos;s military presence in the region could be reduced , but it could be beefed up again if Iraq balks . 
Invasion could take place at summer &apos;s end . 
This would be a victory for the UN and for the US whose prodding made the Security Council act resolutely . 
That is what the French propose , but that is not what is going to happen . 
President Bush has practically declared war . 
It is to be hoped that Iraq &apos;s conquest will be swift and relatively painless . 
Removing Saddam is a good thing ; yet the way President Bush is going about it must be opposed . 
In the long run , open society cannot survive unless the people who live in it believe in it .
