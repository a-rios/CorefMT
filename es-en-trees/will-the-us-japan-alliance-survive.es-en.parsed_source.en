Will the US-Japan Alliance Survive ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the United States-Japan Security Treaty , a central feature of stability in East Asia for half a century . 
But now , with the Japanese experiencing a period of domestic political uncertainty , and North Korea &apos;s nuclear tests and missile launches increasing their anxiety , will Japan reverse its long-standing decision not to seek a national nuclear-deterrent capability ? 
Is the US-Japan alliance coming to an end ? 
In the early 1990 &quot; s , many Americans regarded Japan as an economic threat . 
Some people - in both countries - viewed the security alliance as a Cold War relic to be discarded . 
These trends were reversed by the Clinton administration &apos;s 1995 &quot; East Asia Strategy Report . &quot; 
In 1996 , the Clinton-Hashimoto Declaration stated that the US-Japan security alliance was the foundation for stability that would allow growing prosperity in post-Cold War East Asia . 
That approach has continued on a bipartisan basis in the US , and polls show that it retains broad acceptance in Japan . 
Most close observers of the relationship agree that the US-Japan alliance is in much better shape today than 15 years ago . 
Nonetheless , the alliance faces three major challenges in a new external environment . 
One is North Korea , whose recent behavior has been clever and deceptive . 
The North Koreans have violated their agreements , knowing that China , the country with the greatest potential leverage , is most concerned about regime collapse in North Korea , and thus the threat of chaos on its borders . 
Japan officially endorses the objective of a non-nuclear world , but it relies on America &apos;s extended nuclear deterrent , and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear blackmail from North Korea ( or China ) . 
The Japanese fear that the credibility of American extended deterrence will be weakened if the US decreases its nuclear forces to parity with China . 
It is a mistake , however , to believe that extended deterrence depends on parity in numbers of nuclear weapons . 
Rather , it depends on a combination of capability and credibility . 
During the Cold War , the US was able to defend Berlin because our promise to do so was made credible by the NATO alliance and the presence of American troops , whose lives would be on the line in the event of a Soviet attack . 
Indeed , the best guarantee of American extended deterrence over Japan remains the presence of nearly 50,000 American troops ( which Japan helps to maintain with generous host-nation support ) . 
Credibility is also enhanced by joint projects such as the development of regional ballistic missile defense . 
Equally important are American actions that show the high priority that the US gives to the alliance , and its guarantees not to engage in what Japan fears will be &quot; Japan-passing &quot; in its relations with Asia . 
That is why it was so important that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &apos;s first trip was to Asia , and her first stop in Japan . 
It is also why it is mistaken to speak of a formal G-2 with China , rather than multilateral cooperation . 
A second challenge for Japan is the dramatic rise of China &apos;s economy . 
Although an important trade partner , China &apos;s growing power makes Japan nervous . 
When re-negotiating the US-Japan security alliance in the 1990 &quot; s , Japanese leaders sometimes privately asked me if the US would desert Japan in favor of China . 
I responded then ( and today ) that there is little prospect of such a reversal , for two reasons . 
First , China poses a potential threat , whereas Japan does not . 
Second , the US shares democratic values with Japan , and China is not a democracy . 
Moreover , China &apos;s internal evolution remains uncertain . 
While Chinese are more free today than at any time in their history , China &apos;s political evolution has lagged behind its economic progress . 
Unlike India , China has not solved the problem of political participation . 
There is always a residual danger that China will embrace nationalism to ward off domestic problems . 
At the same time , it is in the interest of the US , Japan , and China that China &apos;s rise be peaceful and harmonious ( in the words of Chinese leaders ) . 
Treat China as an enemy , and you guarantee enmity . 
That is why the strategy of integration , plus a hedge against uncertainty , makes sense for both the US and Japan . 
Indeed , there are strong grounds for the US , Japan , and China to engage in areas of trilateral and other regional cooperation . 
Third , the US-Japan alliance will have to face a new set of transnational challenges to our vital interests , such as pandemics , terrorism , and human outflows from failed states . 
Chief among these challenges is the threat posed by global warming , with China having surpassed the US as the leading producer of carbon-dioxide emissions ( though not in per capita terms ) . 
Fortunately , this is an area that plays to Japan &apos;s strengths . 
Although some Japanese complain about the unequal nature of the alliance &apos;s security components , owing to the limits that Japan has accepted on the use of force , in these new areas , Japan is a stronger partner . 
Japan &apos;s overseas development assistance in places ranging from Africa to Afghanistan , its participation in global health projects , its support of the United Nations , its naval participation in anti-piracy operations , and its research and development on energy efficiency place it at the forefront in dealing with the new transnational challenges . 
Given today &apos;s agenda , there is enormous potential for an equal partnership , working with others , in the provision of global public goods that will benefit the US , Japan , and the rest of the world . 
That is why I remain optimistic about the future of the US-Japan alliance .
