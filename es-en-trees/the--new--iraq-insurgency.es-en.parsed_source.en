The &quot; New &quot; Iraq Insurgency Sun Tzu , the great Chinese philosopher of war , once wrote , &quot; If you know the enemy and know yourself , you need not fear the result of a hundred battles . &quot; 
The absence of such knowledge invites trouble , often disaster . 
This certainly applies to the ongoing conflict in Iraq , where understanding the insurgents is both crucial and difficult . 
To some degree , the Iraq insurgency reflects its historic predecessors . 
The conflict is &quot; armed theater , &quot; in which the antagonists are simultaneously locked in struggle with each other and sending messages to wider audiences , particularly the Iraqi people . 
Like all insurgencies , public support - or the lack of it - will determine the outcome . 
Moreover , it is likely to be a protracted performance . 
History suggests that once an insurgency reaches &quot; critical mass , &quot; it takes a decade or more to eradicate it . 
And , like past insurgencies , the Iraq conflict is one in which the insurgents use horrific acts to intimidate the public , expose the shortcomings of the government , and goad the regime into overreactions that might turn the public against it . 
But the Iraq insurgency deviates from its forebears in vital ways . 
Its cultural context differs from twentieth-century insurgencies , particularly the use of a radical ideology derived from religion . 
By contrast , twentieth-century insurgencies were usually secular , based on economic class , sectarian differences , or other deep political cleavages . 
The intermingling of religious passion and political radicalism makes the Iraqi insurgency particularly dangerous and difficult to quell . 
The strategic context of the Iraq insurgency is also new . 
In the twentieth century , the superpowers supported insurgency and counterinsurgency as a type of proxy conflict . 
The Iraq conflict , by contrast , is part of the world &apos;s first global insurgency - the web of individual conflicts spawned by Islamist extremism , most of them related in some way to al Qaeda , and the global war on terrorism . 
For the first time in history , terrorism gives insurgents the ability to strike directly at their enemies &quot; external allies . 
Moreover , the organization and methods of the Iraq insurgency , while not unique , differ from those seen in the late twentieth century . 
Multiple insurgencies co-exist in time and space , each with differing objectives and tactics . 
One component is the jihadists , some of them foreign and some local , with direct ties to al Qaeda or , at least , sympathy with its worldview . 
The jihadists appear to want a Taliban-style Iraq that could serve as a bastion for the wider global Islamist insurgency . 
A second component consists of former Ba &apos;athist officials seeking a return to power . 
With access to extensive funds , this group appears to sub-contract many of its operations to organized crime or &quot; casual &quot; insurgents motivated more by pay than by ideology . 
The third component is sometimes called &quot; Sunni nationalist , &quot; but that phrase is a misnomer , because this group &apos;s members are less concerned with Iraq as a nation than with Sunni domination of post-Hussein Iraq and responding to what they see as personal injustices or abuses . 
This group appears to rely heavily on tribal structures , kinship , and other local affiliations . 
While successful twentieth-century insurgencies developed some degree of hierarchy and a political wing , the Iraq insurgency remains a loose , amorphous network . 
The various components , and the subdivisions within them , do not appear to be centrally commanded . 
Some may cooperate ; others do not . 
Finally , the insurgency as a whole remains nihilistic , focused on destroying the new Iraqi government and the emerging economic and political system rather than articulating a coherent alternative . 
In many ways , the Iraq insurgency is analogous to urban street gangs : each component shares behavioral and organizational similarities but pursues its own aggrandizement and undertakes autonomous operations within its &quot; turf &quot; rather than pursuing a master plan or strategy . 
The good news for those who desire stability and democracy in Iraq is that an amorphous , disorganized , and nihilistic insurgency cannot &quot; win &quot; in the traditional sense of replacing the government and forming a new regime . 
The bad news is that an amorphous , disorganized , and nihilistic insurgency can eventually evolve into a coherent , efficient , and purposeful one . 
This would obviously pose a much more serious threat , but even an amorphous , disorganized , and nihilistic insurgency can survive and block stability , democratization , and prosperity for many years . 
To return to the analogy , urban street gangs cannot seize political power , but they can certainly keep their neighborhoods dangerous , backward , and grim . 
There are , then , three paths for Iraq : evolution of a more serious insurgency , persistent violence at current levels , or resolution of the insurgency . 
At least three factors will determine which path that injured nation takes . 
One factor is the will of the new government . 
Insurgent movements that succeed do so because the government &apos;s will collapses . 
It is not clear at this point how much determination Iraq &apos;s emerging democratic leaders will have . 
A second factor is restraint on the part of the Shi &apos;ite community . 
There are ominous indications that the relative forbearance of this group may end . 
If that happens , the insurgency will be superseded by a much more dangerous sectarian civil war . 
The third factor is the willingness of outside groups - both states and non-state groups - to prolong Iraq &apos;s misery by supporting the insurgency , whether overtly or by inaction . 
Until states such as Saudi Arabia , Syria , and others vigorously dry up the inflows of people and money that sustain the insurgency , Iraq will never become stable , democratic , and prosperous .
