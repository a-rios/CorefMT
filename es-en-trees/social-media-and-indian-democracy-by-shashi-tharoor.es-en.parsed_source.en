Tweets Democratic 
NEW DELHI - On July 4 , Narendra Modi , Chief Minister of Gujarat and putative prime ministerial candidate of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , became the most-followed Indian politician on Twitter , with more than 1.8 million followers . 
( Full disclosure : the long-time leader whom he eclipsed was me . ) 
The occasion was celebrated by BJP supporters across the Internet , and triggered a spate of assessments of social media &apos;s growing impact on Indian politics . 
Four years ago , when I first went on Twitter , many Indian politicians sneered at the use of social media . 
It seemed like every remark of mine was taken out of context in the press and blown up into a political controversy . 
As the BJP &apos;s president at the time , Venkaiah Naidu , presciently warned me , &quot; Too much tweeting can lead to quitting . &quot; 
As recently as last September , India &apos;s Economic Times reported that , faced with such risks , most young Indian politicians were not active on any social-networking site . 
The journalist and poet Pritish Nandy , interviewed in the Times article , remarked that even he had more Twitter followers than Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ( who had only around 195,000 at the time ) . 
Others interviewed made it clear that they had no intention of adopting social media in the near future . 
But the pace at which the political world is embracing social media has accelerated dramatically in the last year . 
Aside from the BJP &apos;s wholesale adoption of Twitter - Modi &apos;s allies on the network include the party &apos;s parliamentary leader , Sushma Swaraj , and a coterie of organized supporters - prominent Indian politicians from all parties have leapt in . 
A day after he was sworn in as India &apos;s president , Pranab Mukherjee announced that he would open a Facebook account to receive and respond to the public &apos;s questions . 
Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee runs a popular and widely read Web site that traditional media outlets mine daily . 
Similarly , Omar Abdullah , the youthful Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir , regularly interacts on Twitter , and his much older Rajasthan and Kerala counterparts , Ashok Gehlot and Oommen Chandy , respectively , have opened Facebook accounts as well . 
More than half of the Council of Ministers are now online , as is the statistics-dispensing Planning Commission , and most government offices are establishing a social-media presence . 
The prime minister &apos;s Twitter account has more than tripled its following in the last nine months , to almost 660,000 ( more than 50 % higher than Nandy ) . 
Indian political issues are being raised and debated regularly - and boisterously - across social media . 
The finance minister spoke to the public about the budget , not on TV , but in a Google Hangout . 
The Planning Commission , the Minister of Road Transport and Highways , and I have all emulated him . 
Even 12 % of India &apos;s population - the extent of Internet penetration today - makes the country the world &apos;s third-largest online market , and also the fastest growing for its size . 
Indeed , in terms of people online , India is expected to overtake the US by 2020 . 
Nonetheless , skepticism about the reach and political impact of social media in India is in order . 
A recent study conducted by the IRIS Knowledge Foundation and the Internet and Mobile Association of India ( AIMAI ) suggests that there are as many as 160 constituencies ( out of 543 in India &apos;s popularly-elected lower house of parliament ) where the margin of victory is smaller than the number of constituents on Facebook , or where over 10 % of the population is on Facebook . 
The study estimates that by the next election , due in 2014 , as many as 80 million Indians will be using social media - a voting bloc that , supposedly , no politician can afford to ignore . 
As one of India &apos;s first politicians to embrace social media , my view is that this conclusion is premature . 
I do not believe , given the numbers , that any Indian election can be won or lost on social media alone . 
Only a small minority of India &apos;s 753 million voters use social media ; with electoral districts of some two million people each , Twitter is of little help in political mobilization . 
Unlike the US , for example , Twitter would be useless for organizing a mass rally or even convening a large public meeting . 
But , while social media cannot be a substitute for conventional campaigning , they can help to set the agenda of public debate , because traditional media - newspapers and television , which do reach most voters - tap into social networks for information about and from politicians . 
This indirect impact makes social media an indispensable communications tool for politicians . 
This will certainly become even more important when developments that improve Internet availability on mobile telephones , and the advent of 4G services , make access to social media more universal . 
Though only 12 % of Indians use computers , more than 70 % have mobile phones , but very few currently find it easy or affordable to use them to access social media . 
In any case , no democratic politician should resist a new communications medium , particularly an interactive one - even if some seem to regard it mainly as a public-relations tool . 
Modi &apos;s triumph has not noticeably been marred by widespread accusations that the BJP is creating &quot; fake &quot; accounts to boost his number of followers ( and , if true , it would be further proof that Twitter now matters in India ) . 
The name Twitter initially put me off , and many Indian savants suggested that it was not a suitable medium for a serious politician . 
But Google and Yahoo ! were once silly names ; both are now household words . 
I am convinced that a majority of politicians in twenty-first-century democracies - including India - will be tweeting within ten years , and those , like me , who were ahead of the curve will have only the consolation of knowing that we got there first .
