America &apos;s Fiscal Isolationism 
DENVER - Patience might be a virtue , but not necessarily when it comes to American foreign policy . 
Consider &quot; the long war , &quot; a bold concept embraced a few years ago to describe the continuing struggle against terrorism , the grudging progress that could realistically be achieved , and the enormous financial burden that it would impose for years to come . 
It was also a realpolitik acknowledgement of the setbacks to be expected along the way ( the &quot; slog , &quot; as then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put it ) . 
Above all , the term was an effort to communicate to Americans , accustomed to waging war with speed and decisiveness ( and insistent on it since Vietnam ) , the long-term sacrifice and commitment needed to win a war of survival . 
Its proponents also understood that the war would not be limited to weapons , but would need to be a sustained effort , involving , as they put it , the &quot; whole of government , &quot; with civilian agencies marshaled behind military - or paramilitary - objectives . 
Daunting as the effort would be , its advocates assumed a sustainable political consensus to support it . 
After all , the United States had been attacked . 
Today , that consensus is unraveling as America &apos;s politicians wrestle with a federal budget that is itself turning into a long war - one with its own casualties . 
The battle lines in this struggle suggest that there is little accord among political elites for any spending , let alone for a long war with far-flung commitments . 
As a result , basic assumptions are being questioned at every turn . 
Indeed , the current budget war seems to be reopening old divisions about America &apos;s view of itself and the world . 
The outcome is far from certain , but even isolationism , a perennial American malady , seems to be making a comeback . 
Isolationism is a familiar refrain in US foreign policy among those elements of the right that consider the US too good for the world , as well as among those on the left who consider America a destructive global force . 
But this time , as perhaps never before , a bipartisan isolationist impulse is being driven by the budget . 
America &apos;s fiscal crisis is profound , and it is not just about numbers . 
As the emotions in Washington today suggest , the aversion to tax increases runs far deeper than concern about their effect on current economic performance and job growth . 
In part , it represents a fundamental - some would say fundamentalist - view that taxes are to government what a bottle of whisky is to an alcoholic . 
Government , as Ronald Reagan told us , is the problem , not the solution . 
That message is bad news for American diplomacy . 
The linkage between politicians &quot; unwillingness to fund domestic programs and the imperiled commitment to &quot; the long war &quot; might elude those in US foreign-policy circles , but it is not lost on the rest of the country . 
Opinion surveys suggest that Americans want to maintain many of the &quot; discretionary &quot; domestic programs - schools , hospitals , transportation infrastructure , recreational parks , etc . - that are now on the chopping block in budget negotiations . 
In places like rural El Paso County , on the eastern plains of Colorado , far from the federal budget debate &apos;s epicenter , spending cuts are the order of the day . 
School districts are increasing class sizes as they shed teachers , as well as deferring maintenance projects and curtailing the school-bus service . 
These cuts are having a very real and immediate impact on El Paso County &apos;s residents . 
Can they , and other Americans who are losing vital services , really be expected to rise above it all and support funding to build new schools in Afghanistan ? 
Not only are America &apos;s public schools starting to look second-rate , but so is its infrastructure , which had long been a source of national pride . 
How many travelers nowadays can fail to note the difference between Asia &apos;s new , efficient airports and the aging , clogged antiques in some major US cities ? 
The budget war is not producing any consensus on fixing America &apos;s infrastructure , but it is beginning to produce a view that Afghanistan and Pakistan are far from being core US national interests . 
Why , people ask , are schools and roads in Afghanistan and Iraq more important than those in Colorado or California ? 
At one point in 2008 , the US military picked up the cost of transporting a tiger for the Baghdad zoo . 
When was the last time the US government did that for a US zoo ( outside of Washington , of course ) ? 
How this debate sorts itself out will have profound consequences for how America conducts itself in the world . 
But it might also take a toll on how the world reacts to America &apos;s fastest-growing export : unsolicited advice . 
Countries take others &quot; advice for many reasons . 
Sometimes they respect the adviser &apos;s wisdom and insights ( fairly rare in diplomacy ) . 
Or they might fear the consequences of not taking the advice ( an offer one cannot refuse , so to speak ) . 
Or , as is true of many of America &apos;s diplomatic transactions , accepting advice could open the way to a better relationship and to additional assistance . 
In short , diplomacy - and US diplomacy , in particular - often involves money . 
But what if there is no money to offer ? 
What if Americans , tired of the budget cuts in their neighborhoods , refuse to support funds even for &quot; the long war &quot; ? 
At that point , senior US officials might well arrive in a country , offer advice , and find that nobody is bothering to listen .
