Venezuela &apos;s Unending Ordeal 
BOGOTA - Venezuela is descending ever deeper into violence , with street protests spreading rapidly across the country . 
President Nicolás Maduro &apos;s government appears to be losing control - using both a strong hand against protesters and a timid attempt to begin a dialogue with political rivals - while the opposition is divided and appears incapable of taking power . Since the current crisis began in February , more than 40 people have died , roughly 650 have been injured , and some 2,000 have been detained . 
Meanwhile , Venezuela &apos;s inflation rate is the highest in the world , basic goods are in short supply , and street crime has reached unprecedented levels . 
And , rather than address these issues , Maduro - who has just completed his first year in office - has denounced the protests as part of an attempted coup . 
Maduro &apos;s party controls all three branches of government and most of the major domestic media outlets , and there are no upcoming elections that might break the deadlock and resolve the worsening power struggle . 
Though there are signs of discontent in the armed forces , the coup scenario seems far-fetched - and certainly hard to prove . 
But the government is taking no chances . 
Three air force generals have been detained , national and foreign news media are being censored , and officials have even cut off supplies of newsprint to all but the government &apos;s supporters . 
Venezuelans , unlike much of the international media covering their country , are accustomed to inflammatory rhetoric from their political leaders . 
But the current crisis is different , for it reflects the painful divide that has become all too apparent since the death last year of Maduro &apos;s charismatic predecessor , Hugo Chávez . 
Maduro , Chávez &apos;s hand-picked successor , narrowly won the April 2013 presidential election over Henrique Capriles Radonski , a young , energetic moderate . 
Hopes of change , however , have since dwindled . 
The government won a larger majority in local and regional elections last December , and Maduro has failed to develop the ideas and policies needed to end the street violence and political paralysis . 
And , though Maduro has contained infighting within his own party , his position is far from secure . 
Still new to the job , and facing mounting economic and political problems , he has yet to prove to the party faithful that he is a worthy successor to Chávez . 
The opposition , for its part , has learned its lessons from the failed 2002 coup . 
It has patiently constructed a coalition capable of competing in elections , a field previously dominated by Chávez ( helped in no small measure by his government &apos;s unrestrained social spending ) . 
As a result , the opposition has been able to score some regional election victories , and mount a credible effort to win the presidency . But Maduro &apos;s opponents are divided over what direction to take . 
Capriles wants protesters to play by the constitutional rules , which would take longer , and probably be less effective in unseating the government . 
By contrast , two protest leaders , Leopoldo López and María Corina Machado , want to bring down the government more quickly . 
López is now in jail , while Machado has been stripped of her parliamentary seat for speaking against the government before a session of the Organization of American States . 
The OAS &apos;s response , like that of other international organizations and foreign governments , has been ineffectual . 
Venezuela &apos;s government barred a commission of foreign ministers sent by the OAS from entering the country to evaluate the crisis . 
The Union of South American Nations , which is more friendly to the Maduro government , has called for dialogue with the opposition , to be mediated by an emissary of Pope Francis ( who has met both Maduro and Capriles ) and the foreign ministers of Colombia , Brazil , and Ecuador . 
The first meetings of government and opposition representatives have alleviated tensions , but no one expects a definitive solution to the crisis to emerge . 
But no other group or country from the region seems ready to enter the fray . 
Colombia and the United States have interests to protect , despite their unease with the Maduro government &apos;s growing authoritarianism . 
Brazil wants to avoid a risky intervention with no clear benefit . 
Members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas , the regional bloc established by Chávez , either benefit from Venezuelan oil or are too close to the government to provide good offices . 
That leaves the government and the opposition to fight it out , with all of the political , economic , and human cost that this involves - and with no obvious end in sight .
