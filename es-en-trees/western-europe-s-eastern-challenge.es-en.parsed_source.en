Western Europe &apos;s Eastern Challenge 
In January , the European Union expanded eastward once again . 
Following the &quot; Big Bang &quot; enlargement of 2004 , which added 75 million new EU citizens , the accession of Romania and Bulgaria has added 30 million more . 
What does this mean for the labour markets of Western Europe ? 
Politicians tend to argue that , although some plumbers migrate to the West and companies relocate to the East , the West will enjoy more jobs in net terms due to the likely expansion of its exports . 
That reasoning is familiar , but is it correct ? 
One thing is certain : enlargement has confronted Western Europe with extremely stiff wage competition . 
Whereas an employee in the old EU &apos;s manufacturing sector on average earns € 26.09 per hour , in Romania the average is € 1.60 and in Bulgaria a mere € 1.39 . 
The view that eastward enlargement will create jobs in the West assumes that East European low-wage workers will complement , and boost demand for , West European workers . 
In fact , this is partly the case . 
West European engineers are needed to design world-class products to be manufactured by East European workers , while people with managerial skills can be sure that their abilities will be needed to integrate the EU &apos;s newest workers into the European economy . 
But for the great majority of workers who have only their normal labor to sell , East European employees are actually substitutes , not complements . 
They find themselves confronted by low-wage competition from people who have similar skills and ambitions , and are consequently likely to lose ground from enlargement . 
According to empirical studies , the group of losers ranges from low-skilled to skilled workers with a completed educational training . 
The implications for the labor market are clear : for the highly qualified in the West European workforce , eastern enlargement will lead to an increase in labor demand ; for all others , it will mean a decrease . 
Due to a fundamental asymmetry in the flexibility of wages this will lead to a net decline of employment . 
Since unemployment is low among the more highly qualified , higher demand for their services will lead to an increase in wages rather than an increase in employment . 
For the less qualified in Western Europe , a decrease in employment will be inevitable , because the scope for wage fluctuation is limited by collective agreements and by the minimum-wage levels that the welfare state sets through wage-replacement benefits and legal minimum wages . 
Wage inflexibility , combined with the substitution effect exerted on the great majority of West European workers implies that eastern enlargement will cause a net loss of jobs in Western Europe , if the labor market remains as inflexible as it now is . 
To be sure , eastern enlargement is leading to an increase in West European exports , because more markets have been opened in which western firms can sell their products . 
However , if exports increase , the factors of production - namely capital , qualified workers , and unskilled workers - must be diverted from other sectors of the economy , and this leads to a loss of jobs there . 
Since export goods are considerably more capital and knowledge-intensive in their production than other goods , the structural change will even reduce the net demand for unskilled labour : capital and talents that move away from the other sectors will not take all the unskilled workers with them . 
The shrinking sectors include the labour-intensive upstream stages of the production process , where jobs have been outsourced to other countries - a phenomenon that is neither apparent to customers nor reflected in statistics on foreign direct investment . 
Moreover , while it is often conceded that jobs can be lost via foreign direct investment , much more important are financial capital exports , that is , the loans that enable foreign firms to create jobs on their own turf . 
Consider Germany , which in 2006 exported capital worth € 108 billion , only € 25 billion of which was for direct investments , whereas net domestic investment in all sectors combined was only € 75 billion . 
Part of this capital export flowed to the new EU members in Eastern Europe , which enjoyed , relative to their size , gigantic capital imports . 
Considering all these factors , the assertion that the EU &apos;s eastward enlargement will lead to net job creation in Western Europe appears to be nothing more than empty politically correct rhetoric . 
Western European wages are far too rigid for the benefits of competition and sectoral change to be shared by a majority of workers .
