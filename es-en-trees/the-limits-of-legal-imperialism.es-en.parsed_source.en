The Limits of Legal Imperialism 
&quot; First thing we do , &quot; wrote Shakespeare in Henry VI , Part II , &quot; is kill all the lawyers . &quot; 
Nowadays , the first thing countries trying to get rich seem to do is import dozens of lawyers . 
In Eastern Europe , former communist countries applying for European Union membership must harmonize their laws with those of the EU . 
So extensive is this process that it sometimes appears as a &quot; legislative tornado . &quot; 
Importing laws and legal standards has dominated attempts by former communist countries to join the West . 
Foreign experts helped draft model legal codes and revised draft laws throughout the Yeltsin era in Russia ; outsiders helped craft Ukraine &apos;s postcommunist constitution , the charters for the central bank of Estonia , Poland &apos;s secured transaction regime , and Bulgaria &apos;s securities regulations . 
But importing well-designed laws from outside a country &apos;s borders didn &apos;t begin with communism &apos;s fall . 
Legal transplants , indeed , are as old as the law . 
The most extensive transplants of law took place when Europe &apos;s empires spanned the globe . 
After World War II , the US launched the first &quot; law and development movement &quot; to promote growth and slow communism &apos;s spread . 
Legal reform efforts in the former socialist bloc mark the second major law and development movement . 
This time around , however , Europe competed with the US in spreading laws eastward . 
What is new today is that , not only individual governments but international organizations , are embracing the idea of strengthening legal structures so as to improve the globe &apos;s international financial architecture . 
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , for example , pushes widespread improvement in laws related to corporate and financial institutions . 
The IMF endorsed legal standards and codes of best practice developed by other institutions , but also promotes the development of new standards , including accounting and auditing standards , securities market regulations , bankruptcy law , codes for corporate governance , insurance and banking regulations . 
The root idea is that such imported laws , once incorporated into domestic legal systems , improve a country &apos;s legal framework and enhance development . 
Is this effort worthwhile ? 
Experience suggests that importing laws and legal standards rarely works well . 
For centuries , Western law arrived with colonial rulers . 
Even after Europe &apos;s empires retreated , laws were still exported in order to foster development in post-colonial countries . 
In many cases , however , these imported laws were ignored , selectively enforced , or were complied with only in form , not substance . 
American antitrust law , when transplanted to Japan after World War II by General MacArthur , for example , led to only six criminal prosecutions in thirty years . 
Land registration systems introduced in Africa conflicted with local customs , ignored soil conditions , and rarely led to the emergence of viable real estate markets . 
Regular presidential elections in Mexico failed to disguise the fact that the same party ruled the country for over seven decades until earlier this year . 
Imported legal solutions , it appears , are unlikely to work unless key constituencies - local farmers or business owners , say - support the process of legal transplantation and develop a demand for the legal solutions the transplanted rules offer . 
Compatibility of imported rules with existing laws also matters . 
Transplanting laws , indeed , seems as risky as transplanting organs because , like organs , legal transplants may be rejected . 
Three factors are at work here : 
- Only a few rules are freestanding , i.e. can be fully understood and enforced without reference to other legal terms and concepts . 
Most legal terms and concepts are embodied in preexisting legal systems , whether informal or formal . 
These preexisting conditions determine the interpretation of new rules as well as the receptivity of a country to imported rules and concepts ; 
- Application and enforcement of rules is determined by the perceptions of both users and law enforcers . 
With the exception of highly technical rules , such as accounting standards , the contents and interpretation of rules is dependent on the context in which they are enforced . 
So , even though a law may be standardized , law enforcement may see divergent outcomes ; 
- Effective law enforcement depends on voluntary compliance . 
A law ignored by most is difficult to enforce , unless the state employs excessive punishment in a few cases or substantial resources . 
Voluntary compliance in turn depends on the perception and acceptance of rules by domestic constituencies in the country that imported a law . 
Moreover , the process by which a law is developed has consequences for the effectiveness of legal institutions . 
Countries that developed their formal legal order internally develop more effective legal institutions than those who rely - or were forced to rely - on legal transplants . 
Still , not all transplants fail . 
Countries that actively select legal norms from elsewhere , adapting them to local conditions , are on a par with countries that develop their legal order internally when it comes to the effectiveness of legal institutions . 
Perhaps the effectiveness of legal institutions in developing countries and emerging markets is not the only goal . 
Standardization of laws could be intended as a signal to international investors . 
If countries that adopt standards are defined as &quot; safe &quot; investments , foreign investors can justify their actions even if things go badly wrong . 
But laws enacted for this reason could lose their signaling power when a financial crisis hits . 
Investors need to take account of the effectiveness of domestic legal institutions , not just the laws on the books . 
As the push to transplant legal norms grows , international agencies should focus on helping countries make their laws effective in practice , not just on paper . 
They should improve access to information about how legal systems and laws actually function in their home jurisdictions . 
This will provide recipient countries a clearer understanding of the context in which these institutions operate and the complexity of the tasks ahead . 
It may also avoid transplanting solutions that simply won &apos;t work absent complementary domestic legal rules and institutions . 
Of course , this task is more difficult and time consuming than designing general standards , but the payoff may be worth it .
