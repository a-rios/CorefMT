Globalization After the Crisis 
WASHINGTON , DC - The world economy has just been through a severe recession marked by financial turmoil , large-scale destruction of wealth , and declines in industrial production and global trade . 
According to the International Labor Organization , continued labor-market deterioration in 2009 may lead to an estimated increase in global unemployment of 39-61 million workers relative to 2007 . 
By the end of this year , the worldwide ranks of the unemployed may range from 219-241 million - the highest number on record . 
Meanwhile , global growth in real wages , which slowed dramatically in 2008 , is expected to have dropped even further in 2009 , despite signs of a possible economic recovery . 
In a sample of 53 countries for which data are available , median growth in real average wages had declined from 4.3 % in 2007 to 1.4 % in 2008 . 
The World Bank warns that 89 million more people may be trapped in poverty in the wake of the crisis , adding to the 1.4 billion people estimated in 2005 to be living below the international poverty line of $ 1.25 a day . 
In this climate , globalization has come under heavy criticism , including from leaders of developing countries that could strongly benefit from it . 
President Yoweri Museveni , who is widely credited for integrating Uganda into world markets , has said that globalization is &quot; the same old order with new means of control , new means of oppression , new means of marginalization &quot; by rich countries seeking to secure access to developing country markets . 
Yet the alternative to global integration holds little attraction . 
Indeed , while closing an economy may insulate it from shocks , it can also result in stagnation and even severe homegrown crises . 
Current examples include Myanmar and North Korea ; before their economic liberalization China , Vietnam , and India were in the same boat . 
To ensure a durable exit from the crisis , and to build foundations for sustained and broad-based growth in a globalized world , developing countries in 2010 and beyond must draw the right lessons from history . 
In the current crisis , China , India , and certain other emerging-market countries are coping fairly well . 
These countries all had strong external balance sheets and ample room for fiscal maneuver before the crisis , which allowed them to apply countercyclical policies to combat external shocks . 
They have also nurtured industries in line with their comparative advantage , which has helped them weather the storm . 
Indeed , comparative advantage - determined by the relative abundance of labor , natural resources , and capital endowments - is the foundation for competitiveness , which in turn underpins dynamic growth and strong fiscal and external positions . 
By contrast , if a country attempts to defy its comparative advantage , such as by adopting an import-substitution strategy to pursue the development of capital-intensive or high-tech industries in a capital-scarce economy , the government may resort to distortional subsidies and protections that dampen economic performance . 
In turn , this risks weakening both the government &apos;s fiscal position and the economy &apos;s external account . 
Without the ability to take timely countercyclical measures , such countries fare poorly when crises hit . 
To pursue its comparative advantage and prosper in a globalized world , a country needs a price system that reflects the relative abundance of its factor endowments . 
Firms in such a context will have incentives to enter industries that can use their relatively abundant labor to replace relatively scarce capital , or vice versa , thereby reducing costs and enhancing competitiveness . 
Examples include the development of garments in Bangladesh , software outsourcing in India , and light manufacturing in China . 
But such a relative price system is feasible only in a market economy . 
This is why China - which appears to be faring well in the crisis , meeting its 8 % growth target in 2009 - became an economic powerhouse only after instituting market-oriented reforms in the 1980s . 
Indeed , all 13 economies with an average annual growth rate of 7 % or more for 25 years or longer , identified in the 
Pursuing its comparative advantage strengthens a country &apos;s resilience to crisis and allows for the rapid accumulation of human and physical capital . 
Developing countries with such characteristics are able to turn factor endowments from relatively labor- or resource- abundant to relatively capital-abundant in the span of a generation . 
In today &apos;s competitive global marketplace , countries need to upgrade and diversify their industries continuously according to their changing endowments . 
A pioneering firm &apos;s success or failure in upgrading and / or diversifying will influence whether other firms follow or not . 
Government compensation for such pioneering firms can speed the process . 
Industrial progress also requires coordination of related investments among firms . 
In Ecuador , a country that is now a successful exporter of cut flowers , farmers would not grow flowers decades ago because there was no modern cooling facility near the airport , and private firms would not invest in such facilities without a supply of flowers for export . 
In such chicken-and-egg situations , in which the market alone fails to overcome externalities and essential investments go lacking , the government can play a vital facilitating role . 
This may be one of the reasons why the 
The world is now so far down the path of integration that turning back is no longer a viable option . 
We must internalize lessons from the past and focus on establishing well-functioning markets that enable developing countries fully to tap their economies &quot; comparative advantage . 
As part of this process , a facilitating role for the state is desirable in developing and developed economies alike , although the appropriate role may be different depending on a country &apos;s stage of development . 
Ultimately , in today &apos;s complex and interlinked world , even the most competitive economies need a helping hand as they climb the global ladder .
