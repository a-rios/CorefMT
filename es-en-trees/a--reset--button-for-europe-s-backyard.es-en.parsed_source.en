A &quot; Reset &quot; Button for Europe &apos;s Backyard 
STOCKHOLM - One year after the war in Georgia of last August , pushing the &quot; reset &quot; button on diplomatic relations is a popular endeavor nowadays . 
President Barack Obama recently journeyed to Moscow in order to &quot; reset &quot; strained United States-Russian ties . 
The European Union , though not in need of a &quot; reset &quot; because of strained ties with its eastern neighbors , is involved in a deep strategic reconstruction of those relations . 
When the EU launched its new &quot; Eastern Partnership &quot; in May , the purpose was to promote further integration with the Union &apos;s six immediate eastern neighbors - Armenia , Azerbaijan , Belarus , Georgia , Moldova , and Ukraine . 
The global financial crisis had made an updated and strengthened policy for the EU &apos;s eastern neighborhood an urgent need . 
Equally important was the fact that all the countries concerned expressed an ambition to move closer to the EU . 
The Eastern Partnership - originating from a Polish / Swedish initiative - offers to the six countries a substantial upgrading and deepening of relations with the EU in key areas . 
In trade and economic relations , it clearly sets out the objective of establishing deep and comprehensive free-trade areas between the EU and the partner countries . 
It confirms full visa liberalization as a long-term goal ( with visa facilitation agreements in the meantime ) , promises enhanced cooperation on energy security , diversification , and efficiency , and comes with dedicated programs and projects to help the neighbors in their integration and reform efforts in all these areas . 
Sweden &apos;s assumption of the EU Presidency this month should help these efforts . 
However , it comes at a time when the Union &apos;s eastern neighborhood faces severe challenges , with the financial and economic crisis hitting many of the partner countries hard . 
Ukraine suffers from the sharp drop in global demand and trade , severely undermining its steel industry . 
Georgia &apos;s economic success has been largely dependent on direct foreign investment , for which there is hardly any appetite today . 
Partner countries that are less integrated into the global market , such as Moldova , have seen the crisis arrive more slowly , but the real effect might be equally as bad , and they are likely to recover more slowly . 
The Eastern Partnership does not offer any quick remedies to the crisis . 
The Eastern Partnership &apos;s offer of deep integration with the EU in the areas such as trade and energy carries with it considerable transformational power . 
The other type of crisis that most of the partner countries are enduring is political . 
In most of these countries , democratic development has not yet reached a point where a change in government is a routine part of political life and can take place without risking the country &apos;s stability . 
The Eastern Partnership is based on the profound values of democracy , human rights , and the rule of law . 
Political association with the EU , and the process of integration under this Partnership , will promote reforms in these key areas . 
The Swedish EU Presidency will concentrate on starting up the concrete work - the nuts and bolts - of the Partnership . 
The establishment of &quot; Comprehensive Institution-Building Programs , &quot; designed to support reform of key institutions in each partner country , should take place before the year &apos;s end . 
Some flagship initiatives proposed by the European Commission will finally see the light of day as well , and new projects and initiatives are likely to be developed . 
Here , Sweden will attach particular importance to energy efficiency programs , which will serve not only the purposes of enhancing energy security and reducing costs , but will also be an important contribution to the fight against climate change . 
The Swedish Presidency , together with the European Commission , intends to organize the first meeting of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum this autumn . 
We hope to see the start of parliamentary cooperation , as well as exchanges between local and regional authorities of the thirty-three EU and partner countries . 
At the end of the year , a meeting of EU foreign ministers and their colleagues from the six partners will assess the progress made so far and give guidance on the way ahead . 
The Eastern Partnership is about EU integration , about the six countries moving closer to the EU &apos;s values , legislation , and ways of working , and about the EU being there to support and help this convergence . 
In Russia , there is a perception that is sometimes fostered which suggests that the Partnership is directed against it . 
On the contrary , Russia , like Turkey , will be welcome to take part in relevant activities within the Partnership &apos;s multilateral dimensions . 
The Eastern Partnership is not an answer to all the problems and difficulties that the six partners are facing . 
Nevertheless , it does represent a clear commitment by the EU to lend its political and economic support to their transition and reform - a process that should bring prosperity and stability to the whole region .
