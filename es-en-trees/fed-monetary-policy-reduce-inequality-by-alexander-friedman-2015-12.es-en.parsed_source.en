How the Fed Just Reduced Inequality 
NEW YORK - The US Federal Reserve has finally done it , raising interest rates for the first time in almost a decade . 
The ramifications for interest-rate spreads , emerging-market equities , and housing demand , among much else , are the subject of widespread debate . 
But , as markets learn to cope with a less accommodative monetary policy , there could be an important silver lining , which most people have ignored . 
Income and wealth inequality in the United States has grown steadily since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008 , but monetary-policy normalization could mark the beginning of the end of this trend . 
Indeed , it should serve to accelerate its reversal . 
Consider a few dismal statistics reflecting the current state of affairs . 
Real ( inflation-adjusted ) median household income in the US is about the same as in 1979 . 
A recent study by the Pew Research Center noted that Americans earned 4 % less income in 2014 than they did in 2000 , and for the first time in more than 40 years , middle-class Americans no longer constitute a majority of the population . 
America &apos;s 20 wealthiest people now own more wealth than the bottom half of the entire population The wealth gap between America &apos;s high-income group and everyone else has never been more extreme ; rich households account for more than one in five of the entire US population . 
Strikingly , one hour north of Wall Street , in Bridgeport , Connecticut , the Gini coefficient - a standard measurement of income distribution and inequality - is worse than in Zimbabwe . 
Ironically , this trend was exacerbated by the policy response to the financial crisis . 
While the recession of 2007-2008 caused higher-income groups to suffer more than lower-income groups ( because the former tend to derive relatively more of their income from more volatile sources of capital income , as opposed to labor income ) , the opposite has been true since 2009 . 
Since then , about 95 % of all income gains have gone to the top 1 % . 
The causes of rising income and wealth inequality are multiple and nuanced ; but the unintended consequences of the recent unprecedented period of ultra-loose monetary policy deserves a chunk of the blame . 
Negative real interest rates and quantitative easing have enforced financial repression on holders of cash , hurting savers , while broadly boosting prices of riskier financial assets , most commonly held by the rich . 
When there is no yield in fixed income , even the most conservative pension funds pile into risk assets , driving prices higher and higher . 
Corporations have benefited massively from these stimulus measures , but at the expense of the working population . 
Profit margins have expanded to record highs as companies have cut costs , delayed infrastructure investments , borrowed at ultra-low rates , and taken advantage of weak labor markets to avoid raising wages . 
But are we now on the verge of a trend reversal ? 
The S &amp; P 500 has rallied 150 % since its 2009 lows , and valuations look rich given weakening growth dynamics ( the Shiller price / earnings ratio stands at 26 , compared to 15 in 2009 ) . 
Against this backdrop , the wealthiest Americans are unlikely to enjoy substantial further profits from their financial investments in the near term . 
At the same time , we should see meaningful upward pressure on wages for the first time in many years . 
The unemployment rate has dropped to 5 % , just above the Fed &apos;s current median estimate for the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment ( NAIRU ) . 
While the true NAIRU level is probably lower , and we are likely witnessing a secular decline in the workforce participation rate , the US labor market should still tighten in 2016 . 
Indeed , the number of those &quot; not in the labor force , currently want a job &quot; category dropped 416,000 , to just above 5.6 million , in November ; historically , this kind of change has been closely associated with rising wage pressure . 
And the average hourly wages for all employees on private non-farm payrolls posted an annual increase of 2.5 % in October , the biggest since 2009 . 
As the Fed slowly raises interest rates , those middle-class families holding their hard-earned savings at the bank will finally start realizing some return on their deposits . 
The long-term effects should not be underestimated , given the helpful impact of compound savings . 
During the last tightening cycle between 2004 and 2006 , households &quot; interest income rose 29 % . 
Although this time , the gains presumably will be smaller and slower to arrive , owing to the likely pace and extent of Fed tightening , interest paid on savings will move household income in the right direction : up . 
Of course , a multitude of political reforms , each with potential positive implications for welfare , could reduce the extent of inequality further . 
But the barriers to such measures - say , to make the tax system more progressive - are well known , especially against the backdrop of a presidential election campaign . 
This means that an increase in real wages for workers will have the most immediate impact , even if the downside is lower profit margins for corporate America . 
The Fed &apos;s decision to raise rates is a historic moment for financial markets and is already ushering in a period of increased volatility for asset prices worldwide . 
Although this may be challenging for investors , we should take comfort in the implications for the real economy . 
The social contract in the US has frayed badly , and this is likely to play an important role in the upcoming presidential election , as voters express anger that the American Dream is increasingly out of reach . 
No economic recovery can sustain itself without rising wages and higher consumer spending power . 
The Fed may have just signaled that the beginning of this necessary dynamic , perhaps the key inflection point of the inequality trend , is finally here . 
And it may also have done its part to speed its arrival .
