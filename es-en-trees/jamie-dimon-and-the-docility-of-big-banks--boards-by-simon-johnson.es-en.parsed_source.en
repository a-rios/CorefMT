Boards on Their Backs 
WASHINGTON , DC - The recent governance controversy at JPMorgan Chase has masked a much larger issue . 
Regardless of Jamie Dimon &apos;s victory in retaining his dual role as CEO and chairman of the board , the more important failure on display was that of the board of directors itself - a problem that affects almost all of the world &apos;s megabanks . 
This is completely obvious at JPMorgan Chase . 
The report of the recent bipartisan investigation , led by US Senators Carl Levin and John McCain , into the infamous &quot; London Whale &quot; trades provides just one example . 
There is also the litany of complaints and legal cases now surrounding the firm . 
It is difficult to see JPMorgan Chase escaping its past anytime soon . 
But the problem is much broader : Not a single global megabank has a well-functioning board . 
Their members kowtow to CEOs , do not examine management decisions closely , and , with very few exceptions , rubber-stamp compensation requests . 
Big banks &quot; boards are supine for three main reasons . 
One cannot build up a significant shareholding and use it to put pressure on boards - let alone pursue a hostile takeover . 
The London Whale is a case in point . 
The pressure brought to bear on JPMorgan Chase was completely inconsequential - nothing significant will change . 
This is primarily because regulators - despite what they may claim - effectively protect megabanks from market discipline . 
&quot; Systemic importance &quot; has become an excuse for maintaining impenetrable entry barriers ( yet another reason why executives want their firms to be regarded as too big to fail ) . 
Second , most board members lack sufficient relevant expertise . 
Who on the current board of JPMorgan or Citigroup has real experience running a giant complex trading operation ( which is what will make or break these companies over the next decade ) ? 
Who among them understands macroeconomic risks not in terms of the platitudes of the prevailing consensus , but as the tail risks - the low-probability , high-impact events - that always wag the dog of financial crisis ? 
Unqualified board members do not ask hard questions . 
And , five years after the largest financial crisis in almost 80 years , one can count the number of properly qualified board members - across all megabanks - on the fingers of one hand . 
As a result , megabanks &quot; senior managers are not pressed to remove layers of opaqueness that shield their risk-taking from effective scrutiny . 
This helps to keep board members in the dark - and gives them a convenient excuse for not really understanding how the business works . 
Effective governance is possible under various formal arrangements . 
In principle , a strong outside lead director can be just as effective as an independent chairman - a fair point that has been made in recent weeks . 
But which huge banking conglomerate has such a lead director today ? 
Which board members are willing and able to stand up to CEOs ? 
That has certainly not been the recent experience at JPMorgan Chase . 
Finally , regulators , too , have been rendered docile in the face of the megabanks &quot; CEOs . 
Regulators have the power to require that boards become more powerful - or at least minimally effective . 
For example , they could tighten the qualifications needed to become a bank director ( in the United States , for example , the requirements are not serious ) . 
Instead , regulators stand idly by while bank boards remain self-perpetuating clubs , with membership regarded as little more than so much social plumage . 
The regulators acquiesce because , simply put , they are afraid . 
Mostly , they are afraid that being tough on bank governance will somehow disrupt the flow of credit . 
It is a silly and baseless fear , but that is how modern regulators think and act - in a state of constant , irrational anxiety . 
The banks in question are so large and so central to the functioning of economies that each of them is too big to regulate . 
Whenever small groups of individuals acquire that much power relative to the state and the rest of us , there is big trouble ahead . 
Power corrupts , and financial power corrupts the financial system . 
The biggest banks were badly run in the years leading up to the crisis of 2008 - exhibiting a toxic mixture of hubris , incompetence , and excessive leverage - and their governance problems today are worse than they were in 2005 or 2007 . 
The 2008 crisis was followed by a long , hard recession ; we should not expect a different scenario now .
