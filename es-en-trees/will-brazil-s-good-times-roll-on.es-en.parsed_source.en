Will Brazil &apos;s Good Times Roll On ? 
WASHINGTON , DC -These are the best of times for Brazil . 
The country has emerged as Latin America &apos;s clear leader and a key global player . 
Its economy was among the first to rebound strongly from the recent financial crisis , and has since maintained impressive growth . 
Poverty has been drastically reduced , and income inequality is declining , as the middle class swells . 
And , thanks to the discovery of vast offshore oil reserves , Brazil not only has become energy-sufficient , but is poised to become a major oil exporter . 
Yet , despite all the good news , Brazilians should be worried , because the good times will last only if Brazil addresses a host of mounting economic-policy challenges . 
Some concern short-term issues ; most are of a medium-term nature . 
In the short term , it is essential to prevent economic overheating : annual real GDP growth exceeded 10 % in 2010 , owing to expansionary fiscal and monetary policies and favorable terms of trade . 
Ensuring that domestic demand decelerates to a more sustainable pace is necessary to moderate the upward pressure on prices that threatens the credibility of the inflation-targeting monetary-policy framework - indeed , in April , the 12-month consumer inflation rate breached the upper limit of the central bank &apos;s tolerance band . 
Likewise , Brazil must cool its overheated labor market and stem the deterioration in the external balance ( which has swung from a small surplus to a deficit of more than 2 % of GDP over the last three years , despite a large gain in the terms of trade ) . 
Moderating domestic demand requires , first and foremost , fiscal tightening , because further increases in interest rates , which are already relatively high , would only fuel further capital inflows and put even more upward pressure on the real , which is already over-valued . 
The authorities have taken initial steps to tighten fiscal policy by announcing significant cuts in the approved budget , but it is estimated that even then , central-government spending will rise by about 4 % in real terms in 2011 from its historically high level in 2010 . 
The authorities are complementing moderate fiscal tightening with macro-prudential credit-restraining measures and an array of ( mostly tax-based ) capital controls . 
In the longer term , Brazil faces a range of fiscal-reform challenges . 
Addressing them successfully would allow the country to generate the savings needed to meet its huge looming public-investment requirements : expansion of productive infrastructure ( roads , ports , and airports ) in order to remove severe bottlenecks to faster non-inflationary growth ; unprecedentedly large planned investment in oil exploration and electricity generation ; and forthcoming international sporting events ( the World Cup and the Olympic Games ) that Brazil will host in the next few years . 
Brazil also needs budgetary space to accommodate needed investment in social infrastructure , especially sanitation and basic health-care facilities , in order to reduce the incidence of infectious diseases . 
It also needs to fund well-targeted programs to reduce poverty further and ensure universal access to basic education ; to improve secondary education , with a view to improving the technical skills of the labor force ; and to support efficient research and innovation . 
Finally , Brazil &apos;s policymakers should aim to remove , or at least significantly reduce , existing tax obstacles to efficiency and competitiveness . 
So , what fiscal reforms are needed to meet these objectives ? 
First , Brazil should adopt a medium-term fiscal framework that targets a gradually declining path for public debt , including a commitment to adjusting the target for the primary budget surplus accordingly . 
Systematic calculation and publication of cyclically adjusted fiscal indicators would help maintain discipline by promoting accountability , as would other improvements in transparency , especially regarding quasi-fiscal operations and the contingent liabilities of the government and public enterprises . 
The creation of an independent fiscal council to vet official budgetary projections would also help in meeting fiscal targets . 
On the revenue front , Brazil should replace the current state-level value-added tax ( VAT ) , which is riddled with major distortions , and the federal cascading turnover taxes with a modern dual ( federal and state ) consumption-type VAT , with a common base and a very small number of rates . 
It should also gradually reduce the plethora of payroll levies that currently add about 50 % on average to labor costs , hindering competitiveness and creating a significant incentive to informal employment . 
On the expenditure side , Brazil needs a new round of pension reform - clearly a priority , given the rapid aging of the population . 
Reforms will need to include both increases in the retirement age and changes in benefits , especially the de-linking of the minimum pension from the minimum wage . 
In addition , a range of civil-service reforms are needed to improve flexibility and increase productivity , while health and education programs require greater cost effectiveness . 
In short , despite rosy appearances , Brazil clearly faces a complex and , in some respects , daunting agenda , which newly elected President Dilma Roussef cannot be expected to accomplish within her current mandate . 
But , it is important that the government make a determined start by picking some &quot; quick wins &quot; to gain credibility with Brazilians and global markets alike . 
Brazil is currently benefiting from a favorable external environment , strong international credibility , and unprecedented prosperity for ever-larger segments of the population . 
But this window of opportunity must not be wasted if Brazil is to consolidate and build upon its current successes .
