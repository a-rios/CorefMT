Rethinking Emissions Reduction 
THE HAGUE - Whether at United Nations climate-change summits or one of the many &quot; green growth &quot; forums , renewables and energy efficiency are consistently regarded as the solution to global warming . 
Even the coal industry adopted the efficiency line in its Warsaw Communiqué , released ahead of the UN &apos;s COP19 summit last November . 
But a closer look at the global energy system , together with a more refined understanding of the emissions challenge , reveals that fossil fuels will likely remain dominant throughout this century - meaning that carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) may well be the critical technology for mitigating climate change . 
The widespread focus on efficiency and renewable energy stems from the dissemination of the Kaya Identity , which the Japanese economist Yoichi Kaya developed in 1993 . 
Kaya calculated CO2 emissions by multiplying total population by per capita GDP , energy efficiency ( energy use per unit of GDP ) , and carbon intensity ( CO2 per unit of energy ) . 
But this convenient interpretation does not correspond to reality . 
In this context , what really matters is the cumulative amount of CO2 being released over time - a fact that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recognized in its recently released Fifth Assessment Report . 
Since the industrial age began some 250 years ago , roughly 575 billion tons of fossil-fuel and land-fixed carbon - more than two trillion tons of CO2 - have been released into the atmosphere , leading to a shift in the global heat balance and a likely 1 ° C increase in surface temperature ( the median of a distribution of outcomes ) . 
At the current rate , a trillion tons of carbon , or some 2 ° C of warming , could be reached as early as 2040 . 
This view does not align with the prevailing mechanisms for measuring progress on emissions reduction , which target specific annual outcomes . 
While reducing the annual flow of emissions by , say , 2050 would be a positive step , it does not necessarily guarantee success in terms of limiting the eventual rise in global temperature . 
From a climate perspective , the temperature rise over time is arguably more a function of the size of the fossil-fuel resource base and the efficiency of extraction at a given energy price . 
As supply-chain efficiency increases , so does the eventual extraction and use of resources and , ultimately , the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere . 
This means that efficiency may drive , not limit , the increase in emissions . 
In fact , since the Industrial Revolution , efficiency through innovation has revolutionized just a handful of core energy-conversion inventions : the internal combustion engine , the electric motor , the light bulb , the gas turbine , the steam engine , and , more recently , the electronic circuit . 
In all of these cases , the result of greater efficiency has been an increase in energy use and emissions - not least because it improved access to the fossil-resource base . 
Countries &quot; efforts to rely on renewable energy supplies are similarly ineffective , given that the displaced fossil-fuel-based energy remains economically attractive , which means that it is used elsewhere or later . 
And , in the case of rapidly developing economies like China , renewable-energy deployment is not replacing fossil fuels at all ; instead , renewables are supplementing a constrained fuel supply to facilitate faster economic growth . 
In short , placing all bets on renewable-energy uptake outpacing efficiency-driven growth , and assuming that enhanced efficiency will drive down demand , may be a foolish gamble . 
Instead , policymakers should adopt a new climate paradigm that focuses on limiting cumulative emissions . 
This requires , first and foremost , recognizing that , while new energy technologies will eventually outperform fossil fuels both practically and economically , demand for fossil fuels to meet growing energy needs will underpin their extraction and use for decades to come . 
Most important , it highlights the need for climate policy that focuses on the deployment of CCS systems , which use various industrial processes to capture CO2 from fossil-fuel use and then store it in underground geological formations , where it cannot accumulate in the biosphere . 
After all , consuming a ton of fossil fuel , but capturing and storing the emissions , is very different from shifting or delaying its consumption . 
Unfortunately , a policy framework built on this thinking remains elusive . 
The European Union &apos;s recently released 2030 framework for climate and energy policies maintains the focus on domestic policies aimed at boosting efficiency and deployment of renewable energy . 
While the framework mentions CCS , whether the EU commits to its deployment remains to be seen . 
Rallying support and political will for CCS - rather than for derivative approaches that misconstrue the nature of the problem - will be the real challenge for 2030 and beyond .
