Gaza and the Failure of Deterrence 
Every day in the Gaza Strip , strategic deterrence - the inhibition of attack by a fear of punishment backed up by superior military power - is being put to the test . 
The escalating spiral of violence by Israel and Gazan militants indicates not only that deterrence is failing , but also that its effectiveness depends on adherence to fundamental standards of morality . 
Some security strategists and just war theorists argue that there may be nothing morally objectionable about deterrence in cases where the lives and welfare of a civilian population are not directly affected . 
The threat of retaliation that underpins its strategic effectiveness remains implicit and hypothetical . 
However , when deterrence becomes indistinguishable from collective punishment - barred under international law by Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention - it is far less likely to achieve its intended result . 
Israel , which withdrew unilaterally to the periphery of Gaza in September 2005 , has been seeking to prevent Palestinian resistance fighters from lobbing rockets into its territory . 
Shortly after redeploying to the borders of Gaza , Israel severely restricted ties between Gaza and the West Bank , as well as the movement of goods in or out of Gaza . 
When a pro-Hamas parliament was elected in a free and fair election in January 2006 , the United States and Israel led a campaign to prevent all banks , including Arab and Islamic banks , from dealing with the new government . 
Israel has consistently rejected Hamas &apos;s repeated offers of a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the lifting of the siege on Gaza . 
Public opinion polls carried out by the Dialog company and published in the Israeli daily Haaretz have shown that 64 % of Israelis support an official dialogue with Hamas . 
But the Israeli government and army refuse , calling Hamas &quot; terrorists &quot; in order to deny them legitimacy , despite previously reaching understandings in southern Lebanon with Hezbollah , which they also consider a &quot; terrorist organization . &quot; 
The Israelis seem to believe that their only option is to tighten the screws on Gaza . 
In the name of deterrence , movement of people and goods has been almost entirely restricted . 
Yet the Palestinian resistance has responded with more rocket attacks . 
Israeli assassination campaigns against militants have merely led to further escalation on the Palestinian side . Indeed , every time Israel &apos;s deterrence efforts fail to produce the desired result , it ratchets up the siege in the hope that this will deliver some kind of knockout punch . 
The result has been a clear case of collective punishment in one of the most densely populated places on earth , with 3,823 persons per square kilometer . 
Upon visiting Gaza , John Dugard , the United Nations &quot; Special Rapporteur on Human Rights , said that &quot; Gaza is a prison and Israel seems to have thrown away the key . &quot; 
In January , for example , Israelis began using its monopoly on fuel supplies to punish Palestinians , a decision condemned the following month by Human Rights Watch . 
Joe Stork , Human Rights Watch &apos;s Middle East director , rejected Israel &apos;s justification of the fuel cuts as a way to force Palestinian armed groups to stop their rocket and suicide attacks . 
According to Stork , &quot; the cuts are seriously affecting civilians who have nothing to do with these armed groups , and that violates a fundamental principle of the laws of war . &quot; 
Likewise , following the Israeli air strikes on Gaza in early March that killed more than 100 Palestinians , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was moved to &quot; condemn the disproportionate and excessive use of force that has killed and injured so many civilians , including children . &quot; 
Notwithstanding the UN Secretary General &apos;s statement , Israel claimed self-defense , as the air strikes followed a rocket attack from Gaza that killed an Israeli civilian in the border town of Sderot . 
However , in his book Crimes of War , Michael Byers , a Duke University law professor , argues that the use of force in self-defense &quot; must not be unreasonable or excessive , &quot; and with regard to anticipatory action , the necessity must be &quot; instant , overwhelming , leaving no choice of means , and no moment of deliberation . &quot; 
In fact , Israel persistently conflates self-defense and deterrence , while employing collective punishment to advance its strategic aims . 
This conception of deterrence failed in Lebanon in 2006 , with Israel forced to accept a UN-sponsored cease-fire agreement , and it is no more likely to succeed in Gaza . 
Indeed , opinion polls conducted in Gaza show a spike in support for Hamas after every Israeli escalation . 
The international community must act quickly to force the Israelis to abandon its deterrence strategy and instead work on reaching an understanding that can result in a cessation of attacks by both sides . 
Only such an understanding can permit a start to the groundwork needed for a political resolution that can permanently end both the siege of Gaza and the occupation of Palestinian lands .
