Obamacare &apos;s Fatal Flaw 
CAMBRIDGE - Obamacare , officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , is the health-insurance program enacted by US President Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats over the unanimous opposition of congressional Republicans . 
It was designed to cover those Americans without private or public health insurance - about 15 % of the US population . 
Opponents of Obamacare have failed to stop it in the courts and , more recently , in Congress . 
The program was therefore formally launched on October 1 . 
Although it has been hampered by a wide range of computer problems and other technical difficulties , the program is likely to be operating by sometime in 2014 . 
The big question is whether it will function as intended and survive permanently . 
There is a serious risk that it will not . 
The potentially fatal flaw in Obamacare is the very same feature that appeals most to its supporters : the ability of even those with a serious preexisting health condition to buy insurance at the standard premium . 
That feature will encourage those who are not ill to become or remain uninsured until they have a potentially costly medical diagnosis . 
The resulting shift in enrollment away from low-cost healthy patients to those with predictably high costs will raise insurance companies &quot; cost per insured person , driving up the premiums that they must charge . 
As premiums rise , even more relatively healthy individuals will be encouraged to forego insurance until illness strikes , causing average costs and premiums to rise further . 
With this in mind , Obamacare &apos;s drafters made the purchase of insurance &quot; mandatory . &quot; 
More specifically , employers with more than 50 employees will be required after 2014 to purchase an approved insurance policy for their &quot; full-time &quot; employees . 
Individuals who do not receive insurance from their employers are required to purchase insurance on their own , with low-income buyers receiving a government subsidy . 
But neither the employer mandate nor the personal requirement is likely to prove effective . 
Employers can avoid the mandate by reducing an employee &apos;s workweek to less than 30 hours ( which the law defines as full-time employment ) . 
But even for full-time employees , firms can opt to pay a relatively small fine rather than provide insurance . 
That fine is $ 2,000 per employee , much less than the current average premium of $ 16,000 for employer-provided family policies . 
Not providing insurance and paying the fine is a particularly attractive option for a firm if its employees have incomes that entitle them to the government subsidies ( which are now available to anyone whose income is below four times the poverty level ) . 
Rather than incur the cost of the premium for an approved policy , a smart employer can pay the fine for not providing insurance and increase employees &quot; pay by enough so that they have more spendable cash after purchasing the subsidized insurance policy . 
Even after both payments , employers can be better off financially . 
News reports indicate that many employers are already taking such steps . 
But the biggest danger to Obamacare &apos;s survival is that many individuals who do not receive insurance from their employer will choose not to insure themselves and will instead pay the fine of just 1 % of income ( rising permanently after 2015 to 2.5 % ) . 
The preferred alternative for these individuals is to wait to buy insurance until they are ill and are facing large medical bills . 
That wait-to-insure strategy makes sense if the medical condition is a chronic disease like diabetes or a condition requiring surgery , like cancer or a hernia . 
In either case , the individual would be able to purchase insurance after he or she receives the diagnosis . 
But what about conditions like a heart attack or injuries sustained in an automobile accident ? 
In those cases , the individual would not have time to purchase the health insurance that the law allows . 
If they are not insured in advance , they will face major hospital bills that could cause serious financial hardship or even cause them not to receive needed care . 
Anyone contemplating that prospect might choose to forego the wait-to-insure strategy and enroll immediately . 
But private insurance companies could solve that problem by creating a new type of &quot; emergency insurance &quot; that would make enrolling now unnecessary and allow individuals to take advantage of the wait-to-insure option . 
Such insurance would cover the costs that a patient would incur after a medical event that left no time to purchase the policies offered in the Obamacare insurance exchanges . 
Emergency insurance might also cover the cost of care until the &quot; open enrollment &quot; period for purchasing insurance at the end of each year ( if political pressure does not lead to the repeal of that temporary barrier to insurance ) . 
This type of insurance is very different from existing high-deductible policies . 
Given the very limited scope and unpredictable nature of the conditions that it would cover , the premium for such a policy would be very low . 
It would not satisfy the broad coverage requirements that Obamacare mandates , forcing individuals to pay the relatively small penalty for being uninsured and to incur the subsequent cost of buying a full policy if one is needed later . 
But the combination of emergency insurance and the wait-to-insure strategy would still be financially preferable for many individuals , and the number would grow as premiums are driven higher . 
Employers with a large number of full-time employees could encourage their existing insurance companies to create the emergency policies . 
They might even choose to self-insure the emergency risk for their employees . 
The &quot; wait-to-insure &quot; option could cause the number of insured individuals to decline rapidly as premiums rise for those who remain insured . 
In this scenario , the unraveling of Obamacare could lead to renewed political pressure from the left for a European-style single-payer health-care system . 
But it might also provide an opportunity for a better plan : eliminate the current enormously expensive tax subsidy for employer-financed insurance and use the revenue savings to subsidize everyone to buy comprehensive private insurance policies with income-related copayments . 
That restructuring of insurance would simultaneously protect individuals , increase labor mobility , and help to control health-care costs .
