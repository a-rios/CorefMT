Europe &apos;s Northern Lights 
PARIS - &quot; The Northern Lights &quot; was the title of a major painting exhibition in Paris a few years ago , dedicated to Scandinavian masterpieces . 
But &quot; northern lights &quot; may also correspond to what Europe , if not the entire West , needs nowadays : a political , economic , social , and ethical model . 
Indeed , in becoming the first center-right leader in Sweden to win re-election in modern times , Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt not only ended the centre-left &apos;s electoral hegemony in his country , but revealed that the modern Scandinavian model of governance is relevant across Europe . 
At a time when budget cuts are the order of the day , political power in Scandinavia is modest and generally honest . 
Women play a major role in society and politics , and have for a long time . 
Scandinavian capitalism has been traditionally more humane , and social injustice , though it exists , is much less destructive than in southern Europe , for example . 
Moreover , immigrants are generally treated with a greater sense of respect for their dignity . 
To be sure , many other Europeans recognize these &quot; virtues . &quot; 
But their natural reaction is to say , &quot; It &apos;s not for us . &quot; 
In order to practice Scandinavian virtues , many believe , you must come from a cold-weather country with a small , homogeneous population that accepts high taxes without grumbling . 
One can behave in such a manner , many Europeans outside of Scandinavia say , only if one has been raised according to the Protestant ethic . 
For Greeks , Italians , and many French , evading taxes is a kind of national pastime , which some even perceive as a moral duty . 
Politics is a game , and power a drug that allows you to rise above ordinary citizens . 
And the temptation to consider oneself the incarnation of the state , rather than its servant , is often irresistible among southern European politicians . 
Of course , it is dangerous to idealize the Scandinavian model . 
Scandinavian countries have their share of problems , such as Denmark &apos;s significant xenophobic extreme right and Norway &apos;s occasional bouts of provincial puritanism . 
But the difference between these countries and their southern counterparts in terms of economic performance , social climate , and political culture are plainly visible . 
The weak and sick men of Europe - from Greece to Spain - are to be found in the south , not the north . 
The Asian challenge , particularly from China , should encourage us to reconsider the validity of the &quot; Scandinavian model . &quot; 
For the Chinese example represents for Europeans a dual opportunity to moralize our capitalism and reinvent our democratic practices . 
We cannot continue to preach to others values that we no longer practice with rigor . To play the moral high ground , we must deserve it . 
Moreover , we cannot simply wait for the Chinese &quot; other &quot; to collapse under the weight of its own contradictions . 
Of course , these contradictions are real , but our main source of strength cannot be their weakness . 
The Chinese model - inspired nowadays not by Lenin but by Singapore &apos;s decades of disciplined economic success - has called into question the traditional linkage ( made since Adam Smith ) between capitalism and democracy . 
In China , capitalism prospers without democracy . 
In fact , a contemporary Chinese joke is very indicative of how the country perceives its role in today &apos;s world . 
&quot; In 1949 , communism saved China ; in 1979 capitalism saved China ; and in 2009 , China saved capitalism . &quot; 
In the aftermath of a major financial and economic crisis - which may yet be far from over - Chinese and Asians in general ask Europeans rather bluntly how we dare try to teach them lessons in financial capitalism . 
After all , during the Asian financial crisis in 1998 , &quot; we &quot; did not come to their aid ; ten years later , &quot; they &quot; saved us . 
China today is increasingly becoming for Europe what the United States was yesterday - a mirror reflecting our weaknesses and our strengths . 
We are too few to become anything other than a &quot; niche of excellence &quot; in the character of our capitalism and our democratic practices , both of which are endangered above all by ourselves . 
Nothing incites failure more than success . 
Since the end of the Cold War , we Europeans have lost the incentive to demonstrate the superiority of our systems . 
We have become complacent and lazy . 
In this context , looking north is essential if we want to regain our universal attractiveness and defend our &quot; democratic &quot; comparative advantages . 
There is more rigor and openness under the Northern Lights , and this is precisely the combination we need , with its mixture of modesty towards others and ambition towards ourselves .
