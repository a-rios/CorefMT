Reinventing Science Education 
VANCOUVER - Despite the growing importance of science in the modern world , science education remains a remote and minor issue for most people . 
This is both short-sighted and hazardous . 
After all , science and technology are not only the primary drivers of growth in the modern economy ; they are also increasingly central to many major public policy issues , most notably those surrounding climate change and health care . 
To be sure , the need for more and better science education has not been entirely ignored . 
But little of this attention has been aimed at post-secondary science education , the only level for which there is data showing how to make substantial improvements without enormous costs . 
Moreover , it is doubtful that great progress can be made at the primary and secondary levels until a higher standard of science learning is set at the post-secondary level . 
The conventional view is that there is little problem with post-secondary science education . 
Scientists and engineers are being produced at rates comparable or higher than in the past , and , while few non-science students find their required science courses enjoyable or useful , that is considered to be inherent to the subject . 
However , the past 20 years or so have witnessed the emergence of research on science education at the university level carried out by scientists in their respective disciplines . 
The results of this research , and the dramatically improved gains in learning and interest achieved in associated teaching experiments , show that there are tremendous opportunities to improve university science education . 
Realizing these opportunities , however , will require a different pedagogical approach , one that treats science education as a science , with rigorous standards for teaching effectiveness . 
It also requires abandoning the longstanding and widespread assumption that understanding science means simply learning a requisite body of facts and problem-solving recipes , and that mastery of those facts is the sole qualification needed to be a science teacher . 
Science education research clearly shows that a true understanding of science , as demonstrated by how it is practiced , is not merely about learning information . 
Rather , it is about developing a way of thinking about a discipline that reflects a particular perception of how &quot; knowledge &quot; is established , its extent and limitations , how it describes nature , and how it can be usefully applied in a variety of contexts . 
Developing such a way of thinking is a profoundly different experience from learning a set of facts , and requires very different teaching skills . 
In many respects , science education today is similar to medicine during the mid-1800 &quot; s , when a new level of scientific rigor confronted long-held beliefs and well-respected traditional medical practices . 
For example , bloodletting had been in use for thousands of years , with detailed theories explaining its effectiveness . 
And there 
Over the course of several decades , however , an enormous intellectual shift occurred in how people came to think about the practice of medicine . 
Rigorous scientific standards were adopted , a better understanding of the complexities of the human body was developed , and a higher standard of evidence for the efficacy of treatments was established . 
The fact that some patients survived bloodletting was no longer good enough . 
While this shift led to far more effective medical treatments , it did not come quickly or naturally to people . 
Even today , a large number of people are willing to reject medical science in favor of home remedies supported only by an anecdote offered by a neighbor or relative . 
There is little reason to think that the adoption of a more scientific approach to science education will be much easier . 
Yet it has begun , and completing it offers the hope of moving from the educational equivalent of bloodletting to vaccines and antibiotics . 
With continued research and effective implementation of new findings about science education , it will be possible to achieve far more meaningful science learning for all university students . 
Giving students a deeper understanding of the world around them is inherently enriching . 
It will also enable them to make wiser decisions on critically important matters of public policy , and to be far more creative and effective members of the work force .
