Congo &apos;s Infinite War 
HARARE - Some time ago , the head of the United Nations refugee agency , Antonio Guterres , said of the Democratic Republic of Congo : &quot; Nobody in the outside world feels threatened , and so the international community is not really paying attention . &quot; 
Not anymore : currently , Congo &apos;s eastern province of North Kivu is in the headlines almost every day . 
Last August , fighting to the north of the provincial capital Goma flared up again , provoking a major humanitarian crisis that has no end in sight . 
Like the eight-year civil war ( in what was then known as Zaire ) that nominally ended in 2002 , the current fighting involves many different local groups : not only the Congolese government forces , which oppose the insurgents loyal to the Tutsi General Laurent Nkunda , but also the Rwandan Hutu rebels who were responsible for the genocide in Rwanda in the 1990 &quot; s and a jungle force known as the &quot; Mai-Mai &quot; militias . 
&quot; It is a basket of crabs , &quot; one Congolese friend told me . 
As always , the main victims are civilians caught in the crossfire . 
The renewed fighting , coming eight months after a promising peace initiative known as the &quot; Goma Agreement , &quot; means more civilian deaths and little chance of normality returning to the eastern part of Congo . 
Yet , even at times when fighting is less intense Congo suffers from the indirect effects of the war . 
A mortality survey conducted by the International Rescue Committee ( IRC ) and released earlier this year demonstrates that this conflict is the world &apos;s most deadly crisis since World War II : an estimated 5.4 million people have died as a consequence of the war and its lingering effects in the last decade . 
Today , a quarter of a million people are on the run , almost half of them on territory under rebel control and with almost no access to aid . 
They need food and shelter , clean water and latrines , medical care , and education . 
Women and girls need protection from sexual violence , which flares up when families are forcibly displaced . 
It may sound strange , but from the point of view of a humanitarian relief agency , it is not important on whose territory civilians in need are , as long as there is access to them . 
Aid workers who have been in the country for a dozen years , especially from groups like my own IRC , must work with all parties to the conflict because civilians in need are everywhere . 
The UN peacekeeping force in Congo , MONUC , has a mandate from the Security Council for full intervention in order to provide protection to the civilian population . 
So when aid workers are stopped at gunpoint and cannot talk their way through , humanitarian agencies naturally turn to MONUC to guarantee access . 
Humanitarian workers are not military strategists , so they cannot judge what kind and what size of deployment of peacekeepers is adequate . 
Indeed , at the height of the fighting for control of the northern town of Rutshuru last October , the IRC teams that were stationed there decided to evacuate temporarily because the risk was simply too great . 
Together with other aid agencies , IRC staff formed a convoy and MONUC offered armed vehicles to protect it . 
What followed were many hours of harassment , humiliation , threats with live hand grenades , shots fired at the feet of one of our colleagues , and looting and ransacking of the IRC premises . 
Finally , another group of MONUC peacekeepers - this time from India - came to the rescue and helped evacuate the aid workers on helicopters . 
Protecting the humanitarian effort now underway is essential to the sheer physical survival of the Congolese displaced in North Kivu , but the only lasting solution is a ceasefire followed by a peace treaty , possibly along the lines of the &quot; Goma agreement . &quot; 
Paradoxically , the current fighting and the masses of displaced persons that it produced have helped to draw attention to the crisis . 
This moment must be seized not only to beef up MONUC , but , more importantly , to use all existing leverage with the combatants and the governments that back them to get all the parties to return to the negotiating table . 
The televised tragedy , and the shortcomings that can be observed close up , can and must be stopped , lest - as often happens with Congo - the crisis disappears from the front pages , while the killing continues unseen .
