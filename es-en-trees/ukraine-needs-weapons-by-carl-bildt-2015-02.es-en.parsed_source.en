Why Ukraine Needs Weapons 
MUNICH - It has become something of a mantra among diplomats and other foreign-policy analysts that there is no military solution to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine . 
The only viable path to peace and stability , observers almost unanimously proclaim , is a diplomatic one . 
But , despite the recent ceasefire agreement announced in Minsk , ongoing violence - reflected in the violent expulsion of Ukrainian forces from the town of Debaltseve - strongly suggests that it is time to consider what is needed to block any Kremlin-imposed military solution . 
Three influential American think tanks have already done so , and arrived at the conclusion that the United States should begin supplying Ukraine not only with more non-lethal aid - such as drones , armored Humvees , and medical equipment - but also with &quot; lethal defensive military assistance , &quot; in the form of light anti-armor missiles . 
European governments , however , remain unwilling to reconsider their position on supplying defensive equipment to Ukraine , and have instead reiterated that a diplomatic solution is the only option . 
Of course , from Ukraine &apos;s perspective , a one-on-one military confrontation with Russia is not a viable option . 
Last year , when separatist forces in the Donbas region appeared to be crumbling under the weight of Ukraine &apos;s counter-offensive , it seemed possible that Ukraine would be able to reassert its sovereignty over the area . 
But the Kremlin quickly deployed battalion-size tactical groups from the Russian army to support the rebels . 
Ukraine &apos;s relatively weak forces did not stand a chance . 
The move exemplifies Russia &apos;s commitment to do whatever it takes to prevent a military defeat of the separatist entities that it has incited and forged into fighting units - a determination that has endured , even as the conflict has placed considerable strain on its armed forces . 
Given this , the prospects for Ukraine to reassert control over the Donbas region militarily are so slim that even trying to do so would be foolish . 
If one considers the strategic ambitions of the separatists and their Russian patrons , Ukraine &apos;s prospects are even bleaker . 
Beyond supplying the separatist groups with heavy and advanced weapons , and deploying special units and forces to support them , Russia now appears to be sending in &quot; volunteers &quot; to train a separatist army that could ultimately go on the offensive . 
Such an army , separatist leaders hope , will enable them - at the very least - to secure control over the Donbas region . 
They would then be positioned to secure a &quot; Novorossiya &quot; statelet extending along the entire Black Sea coast , up to and including Odessa . 
And , in all likelihood , some would even dream of an eventual march into Kyiv . 
To prevent this scenario from unfolding , a robust political dialogue with the Kremlin is clearly vital , as are continued economic sanctions to make clear that Russia will pay a rising price for ongoing aggression . 
But trusting solely in a diplomatic dialogue and sanctions to bring about a lasting peace may be excessively optimistic . 
A more comprehensive approach would focus on strengthening Ukraine in every respect . 
But perhaps even more important is backing for reforms aimed at eliminating corruption and promoting growth . 
The recent agreement with the International Monetary Fund is of immediate importance in this respect , and the agreement with the European Union on a Deep and Comprehensive Free-Trade Area is crucial to the country &apos;s long-term transformation . 
But if separatist groups , with support from Russia , believe that they can control Donbas and the Black Sea coast , efforts to rebuild Ukraine &apos;s society and economy will amount to little . 
That is why Ukraine &apos;s external partners must also help to strengthen the country &apos;s defensive capabilities . 
In such a charged situation , there will always be hotheads , eager to pursue military options . 
But the greater concern is the behavior of pragmatists , who identify weaknesses that can be exploited . 
If the Russian-backed separatists view Ukraine &apos;s defensive capacity as a serious weakness , there will be little to compel them not to push forward in pursuit of their ambitions . 
A political or diplomatic solution would be next to impossible . 
Security experts should identify which actions powers like the US and Europe could take to improve Ukraine &apos;s defensive capabilities . 
The requests for non-lethal equipment made by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko at the recent Munich Security Conference could provide some guidance . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others are clearly right when they say that there is no purely military solution to the conflict in Ukraine . 
But a year of talks and failed agreements has demonstrated that there is no purely diplomatic solution either . 
Only by eliminating - or at least seriously diminishing - the potential for the separatists and their Russian backers to continue their military campaign can Ukraine and its partners hope for a lasting political solution .
