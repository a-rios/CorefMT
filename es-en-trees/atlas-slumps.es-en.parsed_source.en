Atlas Slumps 
If the world is to have a decent economic recovery , an upturn will depend on America getting off its back and continuing to fulfill its role as global importer of last resort . 
No other country is capable of picking up the slack if America &apos;s economy remains soft . 
There is some optimism about Japan getting on its feet again , but over the past , vastly disappointing , decade , too many pseudo-recoveries have been glimpsed in Japan to justify such hopes . 
Europe also seems likely to disappoint . 
Projections of European growth continue to decline , yet the outlook for government policy is for reduced spending and increased taxes as the fiscal stability and growth pact bites . 
Moreover , the European Central Bank appears helpless because it is bound by the self-imposed fetters of its inflation target . 
Nor are emerging markets yet large enough to play a meaningful role in the balance of total global demand . 
So America remains the world economy &apos;s last best hope . 
But this is worrisome for two reasons . 
First , America cannot run enormous ( and growing ! ) current-account deficits forever : at some point the desire of foreign investors to hold ever-increasing shares of their wealth in America must wane and then reverse . 
When that happens , the dollar will fall and the stimulus provided to the world by America &apos;s demand for imports will come to an end . 
Second , there are no signs that the US government either understands or has the will to stimulate the American economy sufficiently to produce rapid economic growth . 
Consider US monetary policy . 
America &apos;s Federal Reserve has pushed the short-term safe interest rates it controls down to remarkably low levels : 1.25 % per year . 
Short-term interest rates cannot be pushed much lower . 
More importantly , would the limited amount that interest rates can yet be cut do much to boost demand ? 
Not likely . 
Long-term interest rates could be pushed significantly lower if the Federal Reserve were to undertake the unprecedented step of mammoth purchases of long-term government bonds . 
But would the Fed take that unprecedented step without a severe domestic crisis ? 
A situation in which the US muddles through with growth that is positive but slower than the growth rate of potential output - today &apos;s conditions - is unlikely to prompt drastic action from the Fed . 
However , US growth that is positive but slow is of little help to the rest of the world . 
Now consider fiscal policy . 
The baroque structure of US government has always been hostile to the effective exercise of fiscal policy . 
Attempts to use fiscal policy to stabilize the economy usually show up too late to help , no matter the situation . 
Fortunately , such efforts have usually been too small in magnitude to do significant economic destruction . 
Until now . 
Whatever tax-law changes the US Congress approves this summer are unlikely to have big effects on the flow of purchasing power to households until April , 2004 . 
Similarly , whatever spending increases the US Congress approves this fall will not have significant effects on government spending until the summer and fall of 2004 . 
But this time , slow stimulus is amplified by failures in the design of the Bush economic program . 
Even the conservative-minded &quot; Economist &quot; observes that the Bush Administration &apos;s proposals are not a short-term economic stimulus : they simply do &quot; not provide the short , sharp boost for which many political leaders , including Mr Bush himself , have been calling . &quot; 
If and when the proposed tax cuts are fully phased in , they will not provide the $ 1,000 a year boost to the income of 90 million households that the Bush Administration implies they will . 
Instead , they will likely provide something like an additional $ 250 a year to the incomes of typical households - and much larger windfalls for households with annual incomes exceeding $ 200,000 . 
But these are the people least likely to take their tax cuts and spend them to boost aggregate demand . 
Looking further out , US fiscal policy &apos;s long-run problems will become increasingly visible and urgent : there is not even a hint of a plan for reconciling the long-term costs of the social insurance state with American taxpayers &apos; limited patience with high taxes . 
For most of the 1990s , the world economy did remarkably well , despite large-scale financial crises , the spread of AIDS in stagnating Africa , and the problems of transition economies . 
This was due to sound economic policy in the US ( starting with the Bush-Mitchell-Foley tax increase of 1990 ) , as well as some extraordinarily good luck in America . 
There are no signs that wise economic policy in the US will continue in the first decade of the new century . 
If global prosperity is to return , America &apos;s economic luck will have to be even better than it was in the 1990s . 
The rest of the world economy would do well to play it safe and start making its own luck .
