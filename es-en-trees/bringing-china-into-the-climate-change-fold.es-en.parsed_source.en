Bringing China into the Climate Change Fold 
POZNAN - The current economic crisis cast a pall over climate change talks held this month in Poland . While negotiators hoped for concrete progress towards an international climate agreement , the world &apos;s two largest polluters were distracted - the US with preventing a collapse of the financial system in the midst of a presidential transition , China with a slowdown in domestic investment and weakening foreign demand for its manufactured goods . 
With American home values and retirement savings falling and Chinese unemployment numbers rising , observers worry that neither America nor China will have much appetite to cut emissions . 
The paradox here is that the crisis presents a unique opportunity for the United States and China to strike a deal that would lay the groundwork for a global climate agreement . 
Indeed , one of the main goals of the most recent biannual meeting of the US / China Strategic Economic Dialogue ( held the week before the climate talks began ) was to begin work under the &quot; Ten Year Energy and Environment Cooperation Framework &quot; created earlier this year . 
This bilateral initiative comes on the heels of a decade in which America abstained from international efforts to address climate change , concerned that if it acts but China doesn &apos;t , the world will fail to meet its emission-reduction targets and US industry will be disadvantaged . 
China has countered that its historic and per capita emissions remain well below US levels , and that to cap aggregate national emissions at the same level as the US would imply a personal carbon budget in San Francisco five times greater than in Shanghai . 
The Strategic Economic Dialogue sidestepped this disagreement on burden sharing and focused instead on what the two countries have in common . 
Both depend on imported oil for transport and on domestic coal for power generation . 
Both have strong state-level governments and balkanized regulatory and energy supply systems . 
But the structure of the two countries &quot; economies , and what drives their energy needs - and thus greenhouse gas emissions - are very different . It is this difference that offers the best chance for addressing climate change head-on . 
Economically , the US and China are mirror images , opposite sides of a massive global imbalance . 
Americans spend too much and save too little , leaving a $ 250 billion trade deficit financed by other countries . 
Much of this credit comes from China , where firms and citizens save too much and consume too little , leaving a surplus of both goods and capital that flows abroad . 
This macroeconomic imbalance is reflected in the two countries &quot; carbon footprints . 
In the US , more than 70 % of CO2 emissions come from consumer-related activities , whether gas-guzzling SUVs or power-hungry McMansions . 
In China , more than 70 % of emissions come from industry . 
Steel production alone consumes 18 % of the country &apos;s energy resources , nearly twice as much as all Chinese households . 
The chemical industry consumes more energy than all private transportation , and aluminum production rivals the commercial sector in terms of electricity demand . 
In terms of brokering a climate deal , this imbalance is good news . 
It suggests a framework for reducing emissions that respects the development needs of China &apos;s households , addresses US firms &quot; competitiveness concerns , and adheres to the principle of &quot; common but differentiated responsibilities &quot; embedded in international negotiations . 
In recognition of its outsized historic and per capita emissions , the US should agree to economy-wide emissions reductions in line with domestic climate legislation currently being considered . 
China should be excused of consumer-related obligations for the time being , but assume commitments on industrial production based on the recognition that effectively reducing emissions in these sectors requires coordinated international action . 
China &apos;s leaders are already eager to rein in energy- and pollution-intensive industry for reasons of national security , air and water quality , and simple economic efficiency . 
Production of steel , cement , chemicals , paper , and aluminum alone account for nearly half of China &apos;s energy needs and generate nearly half of the air pollution that claims over 300,000 lives and costs the economy close to $ 100 billion each year . 
Yet these five industries combined employ only 14 million people out of a total labor force of 770 million and fewer people than they did a decade ago . 
For a country in an employment crisis , investing in energy-intensive industry is a losing strategy . 
Using climate policy to discipline these industries would help rebalance the economy while taking a bite out of China &apos;s emissions . 
If China imposes a carbon price for its energy-intensive manufacturing industries , the US won &apos;t need to do so at its border , lowering risks to the international trading system on which both countries rely . 
The current crisis is already unwinding some of the imbalances that drive both countries &quot; energy and environment challenges . 
US oil demand has fallen 8 % as consumers tighten their belts , and electricity demand in China is down by 10 % as energy-intensive industries cut production . 
A smart response to the crisis can perpetuate these trends . 
Future US consumption will be greener , and the cost of climate policy reduced , if the US recovery package includes money to weatherize homes , upgrade the electricity grid , and help the auto industry improve fuel efficiency . 
If China consolidates its energy-intensive manufacturing , thereby freeing up investment capital for lighter manufacturing and services , then it will emerge from the crisis with a growth model that pollutes less and employs more . 
If the US and China can find agreement on these issues in the midst of crisis , they will pave the way for success when climate negotiators meet again next year in Copenhagen .
