The Economic Case Against Bush \ u0027s Tax Cut 
NEW YORK : Washington politicians are worried over signs that America &apos;s great structural boom of the past five years is over : a poorer outlook for profits , increased corporate debts , and a related slowing of business investment in fixed capital , new customers and new employees . 
If the boom is over , the structural unemployment rate - alias the &quot; natural rate , &quot; or Nairu - will rise to a more normal 4.5 to 5 % . 
Alan Greenspan , chairman of America &apos;s Federal Reserve , can help by avoiding tight money but he cannot undo this structural shift . 
What is to be done ? 
Talk in Washington portends a lurch away from the &quot; sound finance &quot; of the 1990s - the increased tax rates and tighter grip on spending that replaced budget deficits with budget surpluses . 
Republicans propose a massive tax cut while Democrats favor a package of greater spending and a lesser tax cut , but which has the same budgetary cost as the Bush plan . 
Either plan would blow a huge hole in this year &apos;s surplus . 
Future surpluses would disappear by the decade &apos;s end , if not sooner . 
Several economists object to either course . 
We agree there may be some welcome effects in both the proposed Republican and Democratic tax cuts . 
Research - of mine and of others - confirms that changes in personal income tax rates ( the largest part of President Bush &apos;s plan ) do have an impact on structural unemployment , not just net paychecks . 
It &apos;s common sense that an income tax cut , in raising after-tax pay rates , boosts employees &quot; and managers &quot; incentives , reducing costs and raising profitability - in large part because the returns on workers &quot; wealth mostly escapes income tax . 
What is at issue is the justification for the drug of income tax cuts , with its worsening counter-effects and serious side effects . 
The oldest consideration weighing against a tax cut goes back to 1950s neo-Keynesians , who viewed tax cutting as anti-growth . 
An income tax cut , in stimulating consumer demand , diverts resources from making non-tradable capital goods - plants and offices - to non-tradable consumer goods . 
In forcing US interest rates higher , such a tax cut would crowd out many other types of domestic investment , which can only serve to slow development of the Internet economy and slow productivity . 
Another point against tax cutting echoes Paris economists in the 1980s . 
The proposed tax cut will boost the dollar . 
As a result , more of overseas saving will take the form of net exports to the US . 
Less of that saving will be available to finance overseas domestic investment . 
The US government cannot be expected to stifle a once-in-a-generation boom to make life smoother overseas . 
It can be asked to refrain from willfully cutting into investment and growth in the rest of the world . 
An optimistic premise of those who argue for tax cuts is that the income-tax cut they envisage will boost output and hence earnings so much that it will cause little loss of tax revenue . 
They point to Ronald Reagan &apos;s tax cut of 1981 as exhibit &quot; A &quot; supporting their case . 
But tax revenues were shored up back then by a Draconian closure of tax loopholes . 
Congress won &apos;t find enough loopholes left this time . 
So the tax cut would impose a burden on the future either in reduced public services from the start or else a public debt ultimately much increased ( or net asset position much reduced ) . 
This burden may not be fatal , but it should make the tax cut vulnerable to several objections . 
A serious objection is that , while the burden of the Bush tax cut would go on forever , its effectiveness would not . 
With time , the incentive effects would progressively weaken , and the structural lift to employment would disappear , as workers and managers grew wealthier in response to their higher after-tax wages . 
The Bush team cannot justify this temporary fix on the assumption that the structural deterioration is temporary - for all we know , the future is as likely to get worse as to get better . 
Another objection is that , if public services ( relative to national income ) are not to be cutback , tax rates must sooner or later go higher than they would otherwise have done in order to deal with the increased public debt or decreased asset position ( relative to national income ) that results . 
Without foundation , President Bush seems to foresee a future with rates far lower than those prevailing now , thanks to productivity growth - a delight the present generation deserves to share . 
On the calculations of experts like Laurence Kotlikoff , however , we must raise tax rates - more the longer we wait - if the government is to meet the Social Security entitlements of &quot; baby boomers &quot; who will retire two decades from now . 
Tax rates should be raised now to provide better guidance to households about how much they can really afford to spend . 
The saddest thing about Bush &apos;s economic policy is that it turns its back on Americans &quot; traditional desire to leave the country better off than when they found it . 
In the 1990s this ameliorist spirit was expressed in the policy of setting tax rates high enough to pay off the government &apos;s debts and to emerge with a positive net asset position - and the possibility of falling tax rates in the future . 
In Washington &apos;s lurch toward large tax cuts , even large spending increases , there is a profound - indeed , disquieting - shift in economic philosophy .
