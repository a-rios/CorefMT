Kyoto &apos;s Misplaced Priorities 
When the Kyoto treaty enters into force on February 16 , the global warming community will undoubtedly congratulate itself : to do good they have secured the most expensive worldwide treaty ever . 
They have succeeded in making global warming a central moral test of our time . 
They were wrong to do so . 
Global warming is real and is caused by emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . 
But existing climate models show we can do little about it . 
Even if everyone ( including the United States ) applied the Kyoto rules and stuck to them throughout the century , the change would be almost immeasurable , postponing warming for a mere six years in 2100 while costing at least $ 150 billion a year . 
Global warming will mainly harm developing countries , because they are poorer and therefore less able to handle climate changes . 
However , by 2100 , even the most pessimistic forecasts from the UN expect the average person in the developing countries to be richer than now , and thus better able to cope . 
So Kyoto is basically a costly way of doing little for much richer people far in the future . 
We need to ask ourselves if this should be our first priority . 
Of course , in the best of all worlds , we would not need to choose our priorities . 
We could do all good things . 
We could win the war against hunger , end conflicts , stop communicable diseases , provide clean drinking water , improve education and halt climate change . 
But we can &apos;t do everything . 
So we must ask the hard question : what should we do first ? 
Some of the world &apos;s top economists - including three Nobel Laureates - answered this question at the Copenhagen Consensus last May . 
They found that dealing with HIV / AIDS , hunger , free trade , and malaria were the world &apos;s top priorities , where we could do the most good for our money . 
Moreover , they put urgent responses to climate change at the bottom of the list . 
In fact , the panel called these ventures - including Kyoto - &quot; bad projects , &quot; because they cost more than the good they do . 
As the economics of climate change has become ever clearer , warnings from the global warming community have become shriller . 
For example , the head of the UN Climate Panel says , &quot; We are risking the ability of the human race to survive . &quot; 
Such statements make headlines , but they are nonsense . 
For example : 
· At a recent meeting at Exeter in the UK , some participants warned of a 50-50 chance that the Gulf Stream winds could collapse within a century . 
Such a scenario looks great in the movie &quot; The Day After Tomorrow , &quot; but it is unsubstantiated . 
As one presenter at the conference summarized : &quot; No models have shown a complete shutdown , or a net cooling over land areas . 
Hence a shutdown during the twenty-first century is regarded as unlikely . &quot; 
This has some theoretical validity , but ignores malaria &apos;s dependence on poor infrastructure and health care . 
Indeed , throughout the cold 1500-1800 &quot; s , malaria was a major disease in Europe , the US , and far into the Arctic Circle . 
Malaria infections didn &apos;t end because it got colder ( it actually got warmer ) , but because Europe and the US got rich and dealt with the problem . 
With developing countries getting richer over the century , malaria is similarly likely to decrease rather than increase . 
· We are told that sea levels will rise - by roughly 50 centimeters by 2100 in some scenarios . 
This is correct , and it will clearly cause problems in low-lying countries like Bangladesh . 
But the alarmists neglect to mention that sea levels rose through the twentieth century by 10-25 centimeters . 
Did anyone notice ? 
The rise in the twenty-first century will be worse and should not be trivialized , but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the total cost of adaptation will be around 0.1 % of GDP . 
The &quot; end-of-civilization &quot; argument is counterproductive to serious public debate . 
It makes us believe that we only have one choice . 
Yet the reality is that we can choose to make climate change our first priority , or we can choose to do a lot more good first . 
To say this is not to suggest laissez faire . 
Far from it . 
Thousands died in Haiti during recent hurricanes , but not in Florida , because Haitians are poor and cannot take preventive measures . 
Breaking the circle of poverty by addressing the most pressing issues of disease , hunger , and polluted water will not only do obvious good ; it will also make people less vulnerable to the effects of climate change . 
We live in a world with limited resources , so caring more about some issues means caring less about others . 
If we have a moral obligation , it is to spend each dollar doing the most good that we possibly can . 
With Kyoto , the world will spend $ 150 billion a year on doing little good a century from now . 
In comparison , the UN estimates that half that amount could buy clean drinking water , sanitation , basic health care , and education for every single person in the world . 
Which is better ? 
Global warming really is the moral test of our time , but not in the way its proponents imagine . 
We need to stop our obsession with global warming and start dealing with more pressing and tractable problems first .
