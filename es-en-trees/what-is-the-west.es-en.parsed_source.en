What is the West ? 
PARIS  -  
This Samuel Huntington concept has become universal . 
In the 1950 &quot; s , the French economist , Alfred Sauvy had a comparable success with the expression &quot; third world . &quot; 
One reason these phrases gain wide acceptance is their lack of clear definition . 
The &quot; clash of civilizations , &quot; basically the West against the rest , is supposed to describe the world as it is . 
In reality , the West is vague enough to include a vast array of areas without describing their unifying characteristics . 
So what exactly is West ? 
What does Westernization mean ? 
Why is Japan considered Western and China not ? 
Where does Shanghai stand ? 
Is Russia part of the West ? 
From these uncertainties , we can conclude that the West is not a geographic entity . 
It probably first established itself as a mindset when the Greeks , 25 centuries ago , perceived themselves as Western versus the Oriental Persians . 
Since the West has lost any clear territorial basis since then , the phrase &quot; the West &quot; has become a universal not a local notion . 
To be Western or Westernized , above all , is a mindset which does not coincide with any continent , nor with any specific nation or religion . 
Huntington &apos;s mistake , it seems , was to contain the West inside national borders : there is no map of the West . 
No map can work when some Asian nations are Western ( Japan , Taiwan ) , when non-Western groups ( Muslims in Europe ) live in supposedly Western countries , when some Eastern countries are partially Westernized and some Western countries ( Russia ) are not fully Westernized . Eventually it looks easier to define the mental borders of the West than its territorial borders . 
I believe that the West is a mindset defined by three fundamental traits that cannot easily be found in the so-called Eastern civilizations : a passion for innovation , a capacity for self-criticism , and gender equality . 
&quot; What is new ? &quot;  -  a personal greeting since the Hellenistic age - captures the essence of the Western mind . 
The non-Westerner , however , would rather place tradition above innovation . 
But innovation as a fundamental value explains the scientific breakthroughs of the West versus the East . It explains unavoidable conflicts with conservative non-Western societies and it also explains what we should call &quot; the Westernization of the West . &quot; 
The West keeps destroying its own traditions , including its religions . The economist Joseph Schumpeter defined this process as one of &quot; creative destruction . &quot; 
The term could be applied to all walks of life in the West . 
Western conservatives are no less prone to creative destruction than Western liberals : conservatives , indeed , are well known for inventing traditions . Take the 19th century British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli , who invented most of the supposedly ancient traditions around the British monarchy . 
Innovation in the West seems to be a never-ending , self-transforming process . 
Self-criticism , even more than innovation , is a defining characteristic of the West . 
In most if not all non-Western civilizations , pride and self love exclude self-criticism or at least the criticism of one &apos;s civilization as such . 
A true Muslim or Chinese scholar cannot be defined as a true Chinese or a true Muslim by being critical of his own world . 
Not so in the West . 
The Western scholar remains perfectly legitimate when putting to death Western values : there is no Chinese or Muslim Nietzsche claiming that his own God is dead . 
Is there a Chinese or a Muslim Montaigne ready to write that the &quot; Indian savages &quot; may be wiser than us , as Montaigne did in 16th century France ? 
Of course there must be some Chinese or Muslim Montaigne or Nietzsche , but they would not be considered beacons of their civilizations . 
Self-criticism , not self-love , and cultural relativism are the nuts and bolts of the Western mindset . 
The same goes with gender equality . 
This has not always been so . In the ancient Greek , Jewish , and Christian religions , women were perceived as inferior to men . 
But this notion has been contentious in the West for centuries . Nowadays , gender equality has become the norm . 
This is not the case in most non-Western civilizations . 
Some would argue that gender equality is a consequence of the modernization process , not of Westernization . 
This may be true , but the status of women is clearly one issue that puts non-Western Muslims into opposition to the West . 
If we accept the above definition of the West as a mindset , this leaves open three major questions : can the East be modernized without being Westernized ? 
Where do we draw the line between West and East ? 
Will the West remain Western ? 
So far , there is no case in history of non-Western modernization ; the discourse on Asian values , initially started in Singapore , is basically a political discourse . 
It is after retooling their mindset towards innovation and self-criticism that Asian countries have become modern . 
This does not make them less Asian . 
Contemporary Koreans or Japanese remain fully Korean or Japanese but are closer to a Westerner than they would be to their own ancestors . 
Similarly , a modern Egyptian or a modern Saudi will be more on par with a French or an American than they would be with an ancient Arab . 
Does this Westernization make the Egyptian or the Saudi less authentic Arabs ? 
Such a debate does take place within all Eastern societies , which leads us to the real clash of civilizations : all societies today are fragmented between Westernizers and non-Westernizers . 
This clash within civilizations on what modernization means is more significant than Huntington &apos;s alleged conflict between geographical entities . 
The controversy on the essential meaning of modernization , also known as an identity crisis , does impact Western countries as well . 
Vast groups who live in the West , Western and non-Western fundamentalists , fight the unending Westernization process in the name of tradition . 
Many would like to stop the engine by using various guises like ecology or identity , but a Western society where you could not start your day by asking &quot; What &apos;s new ? &quot; would not be Western any more .
