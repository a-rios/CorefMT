From Shock Therapy to Sleep Therapy 
If the 1990 &quot; s was the era of economic shock therapy , the present decade may be remembered for economic reform paralysis . 
Although the reasons for gridlock differ across countries , the bottom line is that few politicians anywhere are having much success in limbering up their economies . 
The problem is not just in emerging markets such as Indonesia , Mexico , and Brazil , where an ascendant left has failed to find a viable alternative to the much reviled &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; of economic liberalization . 
One sees the same phenomenon across many rich countries as well . 
In a remarkable coincidence of timing , Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called for early elections in the hope of energizing reform . 
In Germany , the most urgent needs are for tax and labor-market reform . 
In Japan , the Koizumi government wants to privatize the behemoth postal service , whose giant financial arm is wrapped like a python around the country &apos;s banking system . 
Even in the United States , one of the few places where economic liberalization is not a dirty word , President George W. Bush has his own frustrations . 
Despite a huge investment of time and energy , he has failed to marshal even his own troops in support of a relatively modest proposal to stave off collapse of the nation &apos;s old-age insurance program . 
Indeed , Bush &apos;s popularity has taken a beating over pension reform . 
Some people ascribe the global collapse of reform efforts to a peculiarly ineffective collection of leaders . 
This view is nonsense , and besides , if the public is so unhappy with its leaders &quot; performance , why does it keep electing and re-electing them ? 
No , the problems run deeper . 
The fact is that people everywhere are having trouble coming to terms with the rapid changes resulting from technology and globalization . 
For , although globalization spins off a lot more winners than losers , many people are worried , and worried people press their leaders to slow things down . 
You can tell Americans and Europeans that they should rejoice over the boundless cheap goods and cheap credit that trade with Asia has supplied . 
But all their politicians seem to worry about is how some farmer or textile worker may lose their job . 
You can tell Latin Americans or Africans that Asia &apos;s unquenchable thirst for natural resources will keep pushing up the prices of their commodity and agricultural exports in perpetuity , turning wheat fields into gold mines . 
But all their politicians seem to want to worry about is protecting doomed domestic manufacturers against low-wage Asian competition . 
Outgoing US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan preaches flexibility as a way of dealing with globalization . 
At some level , of course , he is right . 
Today &apos;s world is one of fast-changing currents , where a region flourishes one day , and the next its factories collapse economically as if hit by hurricane Katrina . 
If change is inevitable , we must make our economies more flexible and prepare to live with the consequences . 
There is no other way . 
So why doesn &apos;t the public accept this need for flexibility , which , in the end , is what market-based economic liberalization is all about ? 
The problem is that most people are not thrilled to live in a world of blindingly fast change . 
Most people are creatures of habit ; they crave predictability . 
German workers who make high-end machine tools are proud of their craft , and they don &apos;t want to be told that the same work can be done for much less in Poland and Slovakia . 
Clothing makers in Italy have long been the envy of the world . 
These craftsmen don &apos;t want to be told that they should start retraining as tour guides to service the inevitable horde of middle-income Chinese tourists , as that country takes over high-end light manufacturing like tailoring . 
With such resistance to change , it is no wonder that so many political leaders try to lull their subjects to sleep , hoping that when everyone wakes up , it will all have proven a dream . 
Asia , of course , is different . 
China is developing at a dizzying pace . 
Whole cities are rising out of desert sands overnight . 
China is building more roads , airports , and bridges every five years than Europe and the US combined build in 20 . 
With a long history of cataclysmic , often violent change , Chinese society is perhaps more adaptable than most . 
In India , which is said to have &quot; a strong consensus for weak reform , &quot; things are moving far more slowly - but always forward . 
Whereas India is not yet nearly the factor in global trade that China has become , its 1.2 billion people are pushing inexorably onto the scene . 
Will today &apos;s reform paralysis outside Asia continue ? 
Will the political winds shift to reinvigorate economic liberalization , with politicians reminiscent of Britain &apos;s Margaret Thatcher or the US &apos;s Ronald Reagan coming to the fore , breathing the fire of change ? 
Will politicians finally tell their citizens that if their economies continue to sleep , they may not wake up ? 
I believe that in most countries , the era of sleep therapy will come to an early end . 
But I fear that change might cause a global economic crisis resulting from , say , an ugly unwinding of extravagant US borrowing trends . 
Only then may people start waking up and voting for politicians who insist on re-energizing economic reform .
