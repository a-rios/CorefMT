Gurus and Governors 
NEW DELHI - The ongoing general election in India has brought to prominence not only the usual cast of political aspirants , campaign managers , publicists , and vote-brokers , but also an array of astrologers , numerologists , and pandits . 
Candidates have been flocking to such soothsayers in large numbers , seeking advice on everything from the precise minute to file their nomination forms to the appropriate alignment of the doors of their campaign offices . 
Indians , after all , manage to live in that rare combination of modernity and superstition that defines them as a breed apart . 
Where else in the world is so much made of an individual &apos;s astrological chart , that mysterious celestial database that determines one &apos;s life opportunities , marital prospects , and willingness to take on certain risks ? 
I once wrote that an Indian without a horoscope is like an American without a credit card . 
That observation shows no sign of losing its validity in the twenty-first century . 
It is a truth that seems particularly entrenched in Indian politics . 
As a believing Hindu , I make no claims to pure rationalism myself . 
But I am bemused when a minister &apos;s swearing-in ceremony is delayed because an astrologer told him that the time was not auspicious to take the oath , or when a candidate &apos;s election papers are filed at the last possible minute to avoid the malign influences of the stars at other times of the day . 
Both are frequent occurrences in Indian political life . 
It is not just a question of taking the oath of office at a time determined by an astrologer ; the stars also decide when a minister moves into his office and begins his work . 
Many ministers do not report to work for days after being sworn in ; files pend while the planets realign themselves more favorably . 
Superstition can also influence the selection of the minister &apos;s office , housing , and furniture , guided ( if not actually directed ) by gurus and pandits on the basis of time-honored , if scientifically unproven , principles . 
My favorite story of this type involves a chief minister who refused to move into his official residence because a pandit claimed that it was not built according to the correct spiritual principles of vaastu ( India &apos;s version of feng shui ) , and that he would not fare well in it . 
The bungalow was reconstructed accordingly , at great public expense , with new doorways and windows realigned to satisfy the pundit . 
At last , the chief minister moved in , only to lose his job - and his new home - the next day in an unexpected political crisis . 
Why do otherwise intelligent , educated people put themselves in thrall to superstition ? 
I am all in favor of the innate human desire to propitiate the heavens . 
But what makes us so credulous as to believe that soothsayers understand the code ? 
Not long ago , the chief minister of Tamil Nadu state , the former actress Jayalalitha , decided to add an extra &quot; a &quot; to the end of her name because a numerologist told her that the new spelling would be beneficial to her turbulent political career . 
She promptly went on to win an election in her state , lost the next one , and now is back in power again . 
I suppose it is entirely possible that &quot; Jayalalithaa &quot; has attained political successes that might have eluded a mere &quot; Jayalalitha . &quot; 
But on what possible basis can it be argued that the addition of a superfluous vowel made all the difference ? 
One can scarcely believe that the heavens dispense their favors according to the number of vowels in mortals &quot; names . 
But many Indians are firm believers , as the increasingly eccentric spellings of film titles and movie stars &quot; names confirm . 
One of India &apos;s finest actors , Irfan Khan , suddenly re-baptized himself Irrfan , a change that many swear prefigured the transformation of his career . 
New Delhi &apos;s political circles are rife with gossip about a former prime minister who was guided daily by a godman , and a former finance minister whose decisions were influenced by astrology ( though tempered , it seems , by a former cabinet secretary who passed himself off as an amateur astrologer ) . 
The leader of Bihar state &apos;s Rashtriya Janata Dal party , Laloo Prasad Yadav , reportedly filled his swimming pool with mud and garbage because a pandit told him it would stop the &quot; leak &quot; of defecting members . 
Most Indian politicians wear rings with stones tailored to specific planetary conjunctions that are providential for them , or designed to ward off malefic influences from planets unfavorably situated on their birth charts . 
Many swear it works for them ; others take the agnostic view that one has nothing to lose by indulging such beliefs , except the price of the ring - a sort of Hindu version of Pascal &apos;s famous wager . 
It turns out , however , that Indian politicians are not the only ones vulnerable to seduction by the Indian &quot; miracle mafia . &quot; 
Former Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh reveals in a recent memoir that no less a personage than Margaret Thatcher was fascinated by an Indian godman , Chandraswami , whom she received in her office shortly after becoming Conservative Party leader . 
The godman impressed Thatcher enough with his mind-reading skills that she visited him again - wearing , on his instructions , a red dress and sporting a religious talisman he had given her . 
At this second encounter , Chandraswami accurately prophesied that she would become prime minister within four years and serve for nine , 11 , or 13 years ( she served for 11 ) . 
There was one crucial difference from her Indian counterparts , though . 
When Singh , meeting Thatcher soon after she had become Prime Minister , whispered , &quot; Our man was proved right , &quot; her reaction surprised him . 
&quot; For a moment , she seemed flustered , &quot; he recalled . 
&quot; Then , she took me aside and said : &quot; High Commissioner , we don &apos;t talk about these matters . &quot; &quot; 
Indians do : We may be superstitious , but we are not hypocritical .
