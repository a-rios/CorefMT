The Centrists Cannot Hold 
WASHINGTON - In most advanced democracies , a large center-right party competes with a large center-left party . 
Of course , the extent to which an electoral system favors large parties - by having high popular-vote thresholds to enter parliament , or through winner-take-all constituencies - affects the degree of political fragmentation . 
What , then , are true centrists like Mario Monti , Italy &apos;s respected technocratic prime minister , to do ? 
To be sure , regional and ethnic allegiances play a greater role in some places in Europe - for example , Scotland , Belgium , and Catalonia - but far more so in emerging countries , where political cleavages also reflect specific post-colonial circumstances and often the legacy of single-party rule . 
Nonetheless , even in &quot; emerging market &quot; democracies , such as Chile , Mexico , South Korea , and India , a left-right cleavage plays an important role - while those who claim the political center generally remain weak . 
The British Liberal Democrats , for example , have tried for decades to become a strong centrist third party , without success . 
While the political vocabulary in the United States is different , the Democratic Party , since Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s presidency , is indeed a center-left force , the Republican Party occupies the right , and no other significant party exists . 
In France and Germany , there is more fragmentation . 
Politics is still dominated by a large center-left party and a large center-right party , but smaller groups - some claiming the center and others the right and left extremes - challenge them to various degrees . 
In some countries , the &quot; Greens &quot; have their own identity , close to the left ; but , despite remarkable progress in Germany , they remain unable to reach the electoral size of the large center-right and center-left parties . 
Variations of this basic structure exist in Spain , Portugal , Greece , Turkey , and the Nordic countries . 
The situation is particularly interesting in Italy , where Monti , having decided to contest the upcoming general election , has had to position himself on the right ( which he signaled by attending a gathering of the leaders of Europe &apos;s center-right parties ) . 
He and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi are now fighting for space on the right , with the center-left Democrats leading in the polls . 
There are at least four differences between center-right and center-left approaches to social and economic challenges . 
The right has greater confidence in markets to allocate resources and provide appropriate incentives ; favors private consumption over public goods ; is minimally concerned with economic inequality ; and tends to be more nationalistic and less optimistic about international cooperation . 
The left , by contrast , believes that markets , particularly financial markets , need considerable government regulation and supervision to function well ; gives greater weight to public goods ( for example , parks , a clean environment , and mass-transit systems ) ; seeks to reduce economic inequality , believing that it undermines democracy and the sense of fairness that is important to well-being ; and is more willing to pursue international cooperation as a means to secure peace and provide global public goods , such as climate protection . 
When looking at actual economic policies as they have evolved over decades , we see that they always combine center-right and center-left elements . 
Repeated financial crises have tempered even the right &apos;s faith in unregulated markets , while the left has become more realistic and cautious about state planning and bureaucratic processes . 
Likewise , the choice between privately consumed and publicly consumed &quot; goods &quot; is often blurred , as politicians tend to reinforce citizens &quot; understandable tendency to demand public goods while rejecting the taxes needed to pay for them . 
As income inequality has increased - dramatically in some countries , such as the US - it is moving to the forefront of the debate , reinforcing the traditional political divide . 
Nonetheless , the center right and the center left are arguing about the degree of redistribution , not about the need for some progressivity in taxes and transfers . 
Both also agree on the need for international cooperation in an increasingly interdependent world , with differences mainly concerning how much effort to spend on it . 
So , given that differences in policies as they are implemented have become largely a matter of degree , why do centrist parties remain weak ? 
Why have they failed to unite moderates on both sides of the ideological divide ? 
One reason is that only a minority of any population is active politically . 
Active party members hold more ideologically consistent views - and hold them more strongly - than most of those who are politically less engaged , giving activists disproportionate influence in the political process . 
After all , more nuanced ideas and policy proposals are relatively difficult to propagate effectively enough to generate broad and enthusiastic popular support . 
But there also really are fundamental differences in values and economic philosophies , as well as in economic interests , leading to a fairly consistent positioning of voters on the right or left . 
Disagreement may lead to compromises , but that does not change the underlying differences in starting positions . 
It is probably a good thing that structured competition between large center-right and center-left parties persists . 
Such parties can help to integrate the extremes into the political mainstream , while facilitating alternation in power , which is essential to any democracy &apos;s dynamism ; a system in which a large centrist party remained permanently in power would be far less desirable . 
Those , like Monti , who want to mount a challenge from the center , however personally impressive they may be , have steep obstacles to overcome , and for good reasons .
