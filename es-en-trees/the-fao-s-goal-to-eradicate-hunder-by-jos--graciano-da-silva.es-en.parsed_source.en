The End of Hunger and Malnutrition 
ROME - Sometimes something happens that can have a fundamental impact on mankind , but passes largely unnoticed at the time . 
Such an event occurred in December in Rome . 
The Council of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization decided that the FAO &apos;s goal should no longer be merely to reduce hunger , but to eradicate hunger , food insecurity , and malnutrition . 
The next step will be to confirm this change in June 2013 at the FAO Conference , in which all FAO member countries participate . 
To many , this small change of wording must seem trivial . 
Critics will also say that adopting such a goal without setting a target date for achieving it is largely meaningless . 
Others may claim that even the idea of eradicating hunger is nonsense , because we lack the means to do it . 
For the last 12 years , the Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger by 2015 has been the driving force for hunger reduction . 
The proportion of hungry people in developing countries has declined significantly - from 23.2 % in 1990-92 to 14.9 % today . 
However , this decrease owes more to a rise in the world &apos;s population than it does to the slight reduction in the actual number of hungry people ( from about 980 million to 852 million today ) . 
A &quot; halving &quot; goal has only slight political appeal , as it implicitly condemns the excluded half to a life on the fringes of society , exposed to illness and premature death . 
Brazil &apos;s Zero Hunger strategy , by contrast , has shown that adopting the absolute goal of hunger eradication provides a powerful means of galvanizing government departments into large-scale coordinated action , and of mobilizing society in a truly national effort to end one of the greatest injustices of our time . 
To be sure , it will be increasingly difficult - though far from impossible - to meet the world &apos;s growing demand for food , and to do this in sustainable ways . 
Additional food must be produced using technologies that do not damage the natural resources that future generations will need in order to feed themselves ; that do not fuel climate change , which weighs heavily on farmers ; and that do not accelerate the disintegration of the delicate fabric of rural society . 
But the challenge may not be as daunting as it seems . 
The rate of population growth will be much slower than over the past 50 years , and there is much room for reducing the vast quantities of food that are now wasted . 
The double burden of malnutrition - with hunger existing alongside obesity , diabetes , and other diseases of overconsumption - clearly shows the increasing importance of global dietary rebalancing . 
There is nothing really new about a commitment to hunger eradication . 
Indeed , the FAO was created in 1945 to bring about a world in which there would be &quot; freedom from want , &quot; which , in the words of its founders , &quot; means the conquest of hunger and the attainment of the ordinary needs of a decent , self-respecting life . &quot; 
Because of the widespread fear in the postwar years of emerging global food shortages , the FAO , and the international community as a whole , focused mainly on food production - a focus that remained essentially the same in the following decades . 
Those investments yielded good returns : despite staggering global population growth , from 2.5 billion in 1945 to seven billion today , food availability per person has risen by more than 40 % . 
The problem is that hunger still persists on a vast scale ; so , our focus must now shift to ensuring universal access to adequate food . 
This should be a top priority for governments and a goal embraced by citizens everywhere . 
Breaking the vicious cycle of hunger and malnutrition requires complementing the focus on agriculture and rural development ( more than 70 % of the food-insecure population lives in rural areas of developing countries ) with investment in other social and productive programs , including modest but predictable financial transfers to the poorest families . 
With the right policies in place , the incremental food demand created by these transfers , as well as by school meals programs and nutrition supplements for mothers and infants , could create opportunities for small-scale farmers to expand their output and improve their livelihoods . 
In June , UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the Zero Hunger Challenge at the Rio + 20 Sustainable Development Conference . 
The FAO has accepted this challenge , and is formally setting its sights on hunger eradication . 
I look forward with confidence to a progressive expansion in the number of member governments that commit themselves to moving as quickly as possible toward ending hunger and malnutrition within their borders - and to helping other countries to achieve the same goal . 
It is never the wrong moment for the world to set its sights on ending hunger , once and for all .
