The Identity Clinic 
&quot; Become who you are , &quot; wrote the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche . 
A century later , millions of people are taking Nietzsche &apos;s advice to heart . 
But instead of turning to philosophy , they are using drugs and surgery . 
&quot; I feel like myself again on Paxil , &quot; says the woman in advertisements for that antidepressant ; so , supposedly , do users of Prozac , Ritalin , Botox , Propecia , Xenical , anabolic steroids , cosmetic surgery , hormone replacement therapy , and sex-reassignment surgery . 
Even as people undergo dramatic self-transformations , altering their personalities with psychoactive drugs and their bodies with surgery , they describe the transformation as a matter of becoming &quot; who they really are . &quot; 
&quot; It was only by using steroids , &quot; writes the bodybuilder Samuel Fussell , &quot; that I looked on the outside the way I felt on the inside . &quot; 
With sex-reassignment surgery , writes Jan Morris , &quot; I achieved Identity at last . &quot; 
If Nietzsche were alive today , he might be pitching antidepressants for Pfizer . 
Many people nowadays do not expect to find the meaning of their lives by looking to God , Truth , or any other external moral framework . 
Instead , they expect to find it by looking inward . 
Being in touch with one &apos;s inner feelings , desires , and aspirations is now seen as a necessary part of living a fully human life . 
To be fulfilled , you must be in touch with yourself . 
The language of authenticity has come to feel like a natural way to describe our aspirations , our psychopathologies , even our self-transformations . 
What is new is the involvement of doctors in fulfilling this desire for self-transformation . 
In recent decades , doctors have become much more comfortable giving physical treatments to remedy psychological and social problems . 
Today doctors give synthetic growth hormone to short boys , or Propecia to middle-aged men to remedy the shame of baldness . 
Now that enhancement of psychological well-being is regarded by some as a proper medical goal , the range of potentially treatable conditions has expanded enormously . 
Is the success of these technologies a problem ? 
Not necessarily . 
Some drugs and procedures alleviate the darkest of human miseries . 
For every person using an antidepressant to become &quot; better than well , &quot; another is using it for a life-threatening sense of hopelessness . 
If sex reassignment surgery can relieve a person &apos;s suffering , then the question of whether or not it is treating a conventionally defined illness seems beside the point . 
Yet remaining untroubled by all this medically induced self-transformation is hard . 
One worry is about what the philosopher Margaret Olivia Little calls &quot; cultural complicity . &quot; 
As difficult as we may find it to condemn individuals who use drugs and surgery to transform themselves in accordance with dominant aesthetic standards , on a social level these procedures compound the problems they are meant to fix . 
The more Asians get plastic surgery to make their eyes look European , for example , the more entrenched will become the social norm that says Asian eyes are something to be ashamed of . 
The same goes for light skin , large breasts , Gentile noses , or a sparkling personality . 
Market pressures compound this worry . 
For several years now , antidepressants have been the most profitable class of drugs in the US . 
These antidepressants are not used simply to treat severe clinical depression . 
They are also widely used to treat social anxiety disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , obsessive-compulsive disorder , eating disorders , sexual compulsions , and premenstrual dysphoric disorder . 
Many of these disorders were once thought to be rare , even non-existent . 
But once a pharmaceutical company develops a treatment for a psychiatric disorder , it acquires a financial interest in making sure that doctors diagnose the disorder as often as possible . 
This may transform what was once seen as an ordinary human variation - being shy , uptight , or melancholy - into a psychiatric problem . 
The more people who are persuaded that they have a disorder that can be medicated , the more medication the company can sell . 
Perhaps the hardest worry to pin down is what Harvard political theorist Michael Sandel calls &quot; the drive to mastery . &quot; 
Sandel is worried less about the possible consequences of enhancement technologies than about the sensibility they reflect - a sensibility that sees the world as something to be manipulated and controlled . 
As Sandel points out , perhaps we could design a world in which we all have access to mood-brightening drugs and cosmetic surgery ; in which athletes have access to safe , performance-enhancing drugs ; in which we could safely choose and manipulate the genetic traits of our children ; and in which we eat factory-farmed pigs and chickens that are genetically engineered not to feel pain . 
Many of us would resist such a world  -  not because such a world would be unjust , or because it would lead to more pain and suffering , but because of the extent to which it has been planned and engineered . 
We would resist the idea that the world exists merely to be manipulated for human ends .
