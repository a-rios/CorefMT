The Coming Heat Age 
BEIJING - In the last 100,000 years or so , our planet has endured an Ice Age and a few mini-ice ages . 
But now , with the earth on track to be four degrees Celsius warmer by 2100 , a &quot; Heat Age &quot; is looming over us all . 
This is not fear-mongering . 
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , by 2100 we can expect a mean increase in surface temperature of 3.7ºC , with a likely range of 2.6-4.8 degrees . 
A warmer world will lead to mass migration from stricken areas and exacerbate existing wealth gaps between countries . 
In the words of David Victor , of the University of California , San Diego , the coming Heat Age will be &quot; nasty , brutish , and hot . &quot; 
Greenhouse-gas emissions are expected to reach a record high of 36 billion tons this year.That figure is expected to grow dramatically , as the great emerging-market boom of recent decades , which has lifted billions out of poverty and raised living standards around the world , puts increasing strain on the world &apos;s environment and resources . 
Indeed , by 2030 , three billion new middle-class consumers - most of them in Asia - will add to the ever-growing burden of emissions . 
We can already get a sense of the far-reaching consequences of climate change . 
In 2010 , a major drought in eastern China damaged the wheat crop , forcing the country to rely on imports . 
This , combined with major wildfires in Russia &apos;s wheat-producing areas , helped to double average food prices in global markets . 
In the Arab world , many people must spend around half of their income on food , compared with just 5-10 % in Europe or the United States . 
Not surprisingly , the spike in food prices was a contributing factor in the civil unrest that sparked the Arab Spring . 
As the link between global food prices and political instability demonstrates , we live in a globally interconnected world , in which we are failing to produce in the right way or create the right economic incentives to address profound environmental threats . 
As World Bank President Jim Yong Kim has put it , climate change is a big problem with small solutions . 
So what can be done to find big solutions ? 
At the World Economic Forum &apos;s recent Summit on the Global Agenda in Abu Dhabi , I made three suggestions to tackle climate change . 
First , we need to create a new &quot; coalition of the willing &quot; - including businesses , NGOs , national policymakers , and local governments - that will unite around basic rules and principles to cap emissions by 2020 and limit global warming by 2100 to 2ºC ( the tipping point beyond which dangerous climate change would become unstoppable ) . 
This coalition should draft a framework that countries can adopt and present it at the United Nations climate summit in the fall of 2014 . 
Second , we need to ensure that there are appropriate economic incentives for those countries that sign up - and that there are disincentives for those that do not . 
Measures could include a global financing mechanism for green energy , available only to member countries . 
Finally , instead of relying on the UN as a negotiating forum , countries should cluster around specific initiatives , from renewable power to sustainable agriculture . 
These clusters will , I believe , be more agile and more able to act than one overarching structure . 
Other ideas that were put forward include offering tax breaks to companies that commit to cutting emissions ; tapping behavioral sciences and open data to improve public communication regarding climate change ; and creating a more positive narrative that highlights the benefits for all countries of multilateral efforts to limit greenhouse-gas emissions . 
With the successor to the UN &apos;s Millennium Development Goals due to be adopted in 2015 , there has also been serious discussion about how to make efforts to combat climate change an integral part of global efforts to eradicate poverty and give people a more dignified life . 
The new Sustainable Development Goals should be explicitly linked to environmental issues ; after all , hunger cannot be eliminated without taking into account the complex interaction between agriculture , water , and extreme weather . 
Given that China currently is the world &apos;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases , it clearly has an outsize role to play . 
A fundamental shift from heavy reliance on coal to clean energy must be accomplished . 
China must stop subsidizing fossil fuels , embrace the electric car , and tackle the thick clouds of urban pollution that are a blight to local residents and a stain on its international reputation . 
China has already made some great strides in the areas of the environment and clean energy . 
And China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan provides a clear national policy direction on energy saving , emissions reduction , and industrial development . 
The task for China &apos;s government now is to translate these plans into a demonstration of real leadership , thereby helping to steer the earth &apos;s trajectory away from disastrous levels of warming . 
The urgency of the problem cannot be doubted . 
Indeed , IPCC scientists are 95 % certain that human activity is the cause of climate change . 
If you were told that there was a 95 % chance that your house would be robbed , you would not wait ; you would take preventive action immediately . 
That is what the world must do .
