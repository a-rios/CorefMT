No Shareholders &quot; Spring 
CHICAGO - The ongoing global economic crisis is not only causing incumbent governments to lose elections ; it is also shaking corporate boards . 
When stock prices and profits seemed to defy gravity , shareholders &quot; meetings resembled American political conventions : a show to promote a company &apos;s image , rather than a forum to debate contentious issues . 
This year &apos;s round of annual general meetings has been different . 
Frustrated by low returns , investors are much feistier . 
At Credit Suisse and Barclays , for example , more than a quarter of shareholders rejected the pay package proposed by management . 
At Citigroup , a majority of shareholders rejected managers &quot; pay at Citigroup - the first S P 500 company at which that happened . 
Shareholder activists can also claim other ( at least partial ) victories at Yahoo ! , where a shareholder activist forced the newly appointed CEO to resign for falsifying his educational credentials . 
But many commentators &quot; hyperbolic depiction of a &quot; shareholders &quot; spring , &quot; with its resonance of ousted Arab dictators , is inappropriate for several reasons , not the least of which is the fact that the Arab Spring actually toppled regimes . 
At the moment , the current shareholders &quot; revolt is failing to achieve any significant result . 
For starters , the votes on company managers &quot; pay are non-binding . 
To be sure , compensation committees and boards tend to follow shareholders &quot; wishes , even if they are not legally obliged to do so . 
But they do so mostly out of embarrassment and a sense of guilt , and the changes can be entirely cosmetic . 
The company then quickly invited him to rejoin the board , filling the vacancy created by his own departure ! 
When describing shareholders &quot; struggle to make board members accountable , the right analogy is not the Arab Spring , but the protests at Beijing &apos;s Tiananmen Square two decades ago . 
In a similar vein , the Business Roundtable , composed of CEOs of major US corporations , has deployed brigades of lawyers to squelch shareholders &quot; aspirations . 
One of the ( few ) positive achievements of America &apos;s Dodd-Frank legislation , enacted to address the causes of the financial crisis of 2008 , is - or should have been - the requirement that the US Securities and Exchange Commission repeal the current rules that prevent institutional investors from appointing their own representatives to corporate boards . 
In fact , the requirement was very timid , posing so many restrictions in terms of quantity and length of ownership as to leave the bar to institutional investors effectively in place . 
Still , it was too much for the Business Roundtable , which sued the SEC to stop it . 
Argued by Eugene Scalia , the son of US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , the case against the SEC was won in the US Court of Appeals , DC Circuit , on a technicality - the SEC &apos;s failure to conduct a cost-benefit analysis ahead of time . 
This small victory turned into a major defeat for shareholders when the SEC , rather than performing such an analysis and re-proposing the rule , chose to stall . 
At a conference last December , I asked SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro when her agency was planning to reintroduce the rule . 
I even offered to do the cost-benefit analysis for free . 
But she confessed that the SEC had many other items on its agenda , and had placed the issue on the back burner - a polite way to say that the SEC , like the heroic students in Tiananmen Square , had surrendered under irresistible pressure . 
The violent repression in Tiananmen Square set back China &apos;s move toward democracy by at least 20 years . 
Let &apos;s hope that Business Roundtable et al. v. SEC does not mean the same thing for shareholder democracy . 
This is not a shareholders &quot; spring : it is the winter of their discontent .
