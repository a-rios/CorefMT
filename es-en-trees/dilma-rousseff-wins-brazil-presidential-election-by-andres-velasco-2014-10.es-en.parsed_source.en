Belindia Has Spoken 
SANTIAGO - Forty years ago , the Brazilian economist Edmar Bacha named his country Belindia : a combination of prosperous and modern Belgium and poor and backward India . 
In last Sunday &apos;s presidential election , according to many observers , the Indian part of Brazil voted for the incumbent , President Dilma Rousseff , and the Belgian part voted for the social democrat Aécio Neves . 
India is larger , so Rousseff won . 
This is fast becoming the standard account of Brazil &apos;s election , the most acrimonious and hotly contested in recent memory . 
And it is easy to see why . 
In Brazil &apos;s underdeveloped Nordeste , Dilma ( in Brazil , politicians , like footballers , go by their first name ) swept the vote . 
In the relatively rich South , which accounts for 70 % of Brazil &apos;s economic output , Aécio won handily . 
Similar divisions appear when voters are classified according to dependence on government handouts ( high in the Northeast ) or years of schooling ( high in the South ) . 
Yet there is more to this election than this broad-brush picture suggests . 
In 1974 , when Bacha coined his term , it went without saying that the prosperous and modern Brazil was just a tiny sliver of the total . 
In 2014 , Neves , the candidate of &quot; Belgian &quot; Brazil , won more than 48 % of the vote . 
That reveals how much the country has changed in the last four decades , and how large and influential its middle class has become . 
It was precisely that middle class , fed up with allegations of corruption and a sluggish economy , that turned against the ruling Workers &quot; Party ( PT ) and voted for change . 
But it is also striking that despite the weak economy - growth will barely average 1.5 % during Rousseff &apos;s first term , and the economy is now in a technical recession , having contracted in two consecutive quarters - Dilma and the PT managed to retain the support of Brazil &apos;s tens of millions of poor and excluded citizens . 
This is partly because the recession has not made a big dent in employment , which means that many households have yet to feel the impact . 
Dilma was also helped by the commodity super-cycle , which filled Brazil &apos;s coffers and made it possible to run ambitious cash-transfer programs that helped pull countless families out of poverty . 
These policies were actually launched by former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Neves &apos;s Party of Brazilian Social Democracy ( PSDB ) , but are associated in the popular imagination with Dilma &apos;s political mentor and predecessor , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , also of the PT . 
By claiming ( with no evidence ) that Aécio would cut these popular programs , Dilma dealt the PSDB a sharp electoral blow . 
Using commodity revenues to obtain political support is not a strategy unique to Brazil . 
In Argentina , Bolivia , Ecuador , and Venezuela , populists have tried the same trick . 
So have the vastly different governments of the conservative Sebastián Piñera and the socialist Michelle Bachelet in Chile . 
And the similarities do not end there . 
Now that the commodity boom is ending , all of these countries face the challenge of building a new economic engine to sustain growth and create jobs . 
Without the commodity windfall , they must develop new sectors that can produce new goods and services , requiring new sets of skills and new types of infrastructure . 
This is a tall order , especially for Brazil . 
The structural deficiencies of its economy have long been understood , but little has been done to correct them . 
Brazil has South America &apos;s biggest government ( with a tax take exceeding one-third of GDP ) , yet the authorities save and invest too little , which creates both micro- and macroeconomic problems . 
On the micro side , too little public investment means poor infrastructure and high export costs . 
Brazil has none of neighboring Argentina &apos;s hefty export taxes , but its heavy transport costs have the same effect . 
Education , too , receives little public funding , especially at the pre-school and primary levels . 
Like Chile , Brazil has sharply increased school enrollment but has yet to provide high-quality learning opportunities to disadvantaged children . 
In the OECD &apos;s international PISA rankings of educational achievement , Brazil places near the bottom , below Mexico and Chile . 
On the macro side , too little public savings means insufficient savings at the national level . 
When international funds are available , this produces short-lived booms and large current-account deficits , financed by heavy external borrowing . 
When international liquidity dries up , as it often does for Brazil and Latin America , weak domestic investment and sluggish growth follow . 
Neves had a plan to address these shortcomings . 
Dilma does not . 
Her election-night speech was full of calls for unity and dialogue , and included a pledge to &quot; take urgent action &quot; to resume growth . 
But , like her campaign , the speech was short on specifics . 
On industrial policy , the PT has the right intuition but the wrong tools . 
Partnering with leading domestic sectors to promote innovation is one thing ; doing so through price controls ( as with fuels ) , indiscriminate subsidies , and protectionism is another . 
In recent years , Brazil has taken the latter route . 
Rousseff has little time to waste . 
She will govern a country with substantial public debt ( 60 % of GDP ) , a volatile currency , and high inflation . 
Nervous financial markets will keep the government on a tight leash . 
Neves and his PSDB have come out of this election considerably strengthened , but they also will face difficult challenges in the coming years . 
The social democrats will have a larger delegation in Congress ( including Neves himself in the Senate ) and will govern some of Brazil &apos;s larger states , including São Paulo , home to 43 million people and one-third of the country &apos;s GDP . 
But to reach the Planalto Presidential Palace after the 2018 election , the PSDB will have to convince poor Brazilians - those living in Bacha &apos;s India - that it works on their behalf , and that the policies it advocates benefit them the most . 
Then , and only then , will Brazil &apos;s longstanding divisions begin to heal . 
When they do , the country will get the modern and effective social-democratic government that it deserves .
