Bombs Away 
LONDON - One of the most dispiriting features of today &apos;s international debates is that the threat to humanity posed by the world &apos;s 23,000 nuclear weapons - and by those who would build more of them , or be only too willing to use them - has been consigned to the margin of politics . 
US President Barack Obama did capture global attention with his Prague speech in 2009 , which made a compelling case for a nuclear weapon-free world . 
And he did deliver on a major new arms-reduction treaty with Russia , and hosted a summit aimed at reducing the vulnerability of nuclear weapons and materials to theft or diversion . 
But nuclear issues still struggle for public resonance and political traction . 
It would take a brave gambler to bet on ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by the US Senate any time soon . 
The film An Inconvenient Truth won an Academy Award , led to a Nobel Prize for Al Gore , and attracted huge international attention to the disastrous impact of climate change . 
But Countdown to Zero , an equally compelling documentary , made by the same production team and making shockingly clear how close and how often the world has come to nuclear catastrophe , has come and gone almost without trace . 
Complacency trumps anxiety almost everywhere . 
Japan &apos;s Fukushima disaster has generated a massive debate about the safety of nuclear power , but not about nuclear weapons . 
Fear of a nuclear holocaust seems to have ended with the Cold War . 
Indeed , Hiroshima and Nagasaki seem an eternity ago ; new nuclear-weapons states have emerged without the world ending ; no terrorist nuclear device has threatened a major city ; and possession of nuclear weapons , for the states that have them , seems to be a source of comfort and pride rather than concern or embarrassment . 
With only a handful of exceptions , the current generation of political leaders shows little interest in disarmament , and not much more in non-proliferation . 
And their publics are not pressuring them to behave otherwise . 
Few have worked harder to shake the world out of its complacency than four of the hardest-nosed realists ever to hold public office : former US Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz , former US Secretary of Defense William Perry , and former US Senator Sam Nunn . 
In a series of opinion articles over the last five years , they have repeatedly sounded the alarm that the risks of nuclear weapons outweigh any possible usefulness in today &apos;s security environment . 
Moreover , they have called for a complete rethinking of deterrence strategy , in order to minimize , and ultimately eliminate , reliance on the most indiscriminately destructive weapons ever invented . 
Last week in London , the &quot; gang of four &quot; convened a private meeting with leading think-tank researchers and a worldwide cast of some 30 former foreign and defense ministers , generals , and ambassadors who share their concern and commitment . 
But our average age was over 65 , and the limits of our effectiveness were neatly described by former British Defence Minister Des Browne : &quot; People who used to be something really want to tackle this issue . 
The trouble is that those who are something don &apos;t . &quot; 
No quick fix will turn all this around . 
Getting the kind of messages that emerged from the London meeting embedded in public and political consciousness is going to be slow boring through hard boards . 
But the messages demand attention , and we simply have to keep drilling . 
The first message is that the threat of a nuclear weapons catastrophe remains alarmingly real . 
Existing global stockpiles have a destructive capacity equal to 150,000 Hiroshima bombs , and in handling them there is an omnipresent potential for human error , system error , or misjudgment under stress . 
Pakistan versus India is a devastating conflict-in-waiting , and North Korea and Iran remain volatile sources of concern . 
We know that terrorist groups have the capacity to engineer nuclear devices and would explode them anywhere they could ; we simply cannot be confident that we can forever deny them access to the fissile material they need to fuel them . 
The second message is that Cold War nuclear-deterrence doctrine is irrelevant to today &apos;s world . 
So long as nuclear weapons remain , states can justify maintaining a minimum nuclear-deterrent capability . 
But that can be done without weapons on high alert , and with drastically reduced arsenals in the case of the US and Russia , and , at worst , at current levels for the other nuclear-armed states . 
The third message is that if the existing nuclear powers sincerely want to prevent others from joining their club , they cannot keep justifying the possession of nuclear weapons as a means of protection for themselves or their allies against other weapons of mass destruction , especially biological weapons , or conventional weapons . 
Indeed , the single most difficult issue inhibiting serious movement toward disarmament - certainly in the case of Pakistan versus India , and Russia and China versus the US - are conventional arms imbalances , and ways of addressing them must rise to the top of the policy agenda . 
The final message is that neither piecemeal change nor sloganeering will do the job . 
Nuclear disarmament , non-proliferation , counter-terrorism , and civil nuclear-energy risk reduction are inextricably connected , and they call for sustained commitment around a comprehensive agenda , and detailed argument . 
Sound bites and tweets are an unlikely route to nuclear salvation . 
Kissinger is no idealist icon . 
But he &apos;s always worth listening to , and never more so than with respect to the question that he has been asking for years : When the next nuclear-weapons catastrophe happens , as it surely will , the world will have to respond dramatically . 
Why can &apos;t we start right now ?
