Can Trade Agreements Stop Currency Manipulation ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - It is impossible to deny that trade and exchange rates are closely linked . 
Some economists certainly think so . 
Simon Johnson , for example , recently argued that mega-regional agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership should be used to discourage countries from intervening in the currency market to prevent exchange-rate appreciation ; 
Fred Bergsten has made a similar argument . 
As it stands , the relevant international institutions - the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund - are not organized to respond effectively to possible currency manipulation on their own . 
Incorporating macroeconomic policies affecting exchange rates into trade negotiations would require either that the WTO acquire the technical capacity ( and mandate ) to analyze and adjudicate relevant national policies or that the IMF join the dispute-settlement mechanisms that accompany trade treaties . 
To be sure , since 2007 , the IMF has prohibited &quot; large-scale intervention in one direction in the exchange market , &quot; in a decision on &quot; bilateral surveillance &quot; that also identifies &quot; large and prolonged &quot; current-account imbalances as a reason for review . 
But neither that decision nor later IMF policy papers on multilateral surveillance provide specific and comparative quantitative indicators that would eliminate the need for case-by-case judgment . 
The situation is complicated by the multitude of mechanisms whereby treasuries and central banks can drive down their exchange rates to gain a competitive trade advantage . The most direct method is purchases of foreign assets . 
Moreover , quantitative easing affects exchange rates and trade , even if central banks purchase only domestic assets , as demonstrated by recent movements in the exchange rates of the dollar , the euro , and the yen . 
One could go even further . 
An income-tax hike will reduce private demand ( unless one believes in perfect Ricardian equivalence ) , including demand for other countries &quot; exports . 
Other macroeconomic policies of all kinds influence the current-account balance . 
In short , for &quot; policies affecting the exchange rate &quot; to become part of trade agreements , monetary and fiscal policies would have to become part of trade agreements . 
In that case , there would be no trade agreements at all . 
Consider the problem that would be posed by the eurozone - an economy that faces major challenges in reconciling its members &quot; divergent monetary , fiscal , and exchange-rate needs . 
Germany &apos;s current-account surplus has stood near 7 % of GDP - bigger than China &apos;s - for two years , and is likely to grow even larger , owing to the euro &apos;s recent depreciation . 
Meanwhile , most other eurozone countries have lately been forced to tighten fiscal policy , thereby reducing or eliminating their current-account deficits . 
As a result , the total eurozone trade surplus is now massive . 
Because individual eurozone members have no monetary-policy tools at their disposal , the only way that Germany can reduce its surplus while remaining in the eurozone is to conduct expansionary fiscal policy . 
The economist Stefan Kawalec has explicitly referred to the current policy mix in the eurozone as &quot; currency manipulation . &quot; 
Trade negotiations are hard enough to conclude . 
The need to wrestle with macroeconomic-policy issues could easily cause talks to bog down - and give protectionist lobbies the political ammunition they need . 
That is why the Trade Representative is wisely trying not to add macroeconomic policy into the bargaining , despite demands from powerful voices in the US Congress . 
None of this means that macroeconomic policies that affect exchange rates are not problematic . 
But trade negotiations are not the right forum for discussing the causes and consequences of current-account imbalances and reaching agreements on macroeconomic-policy coordination ; that is what the IMF and the G-20 are for . 
In fact , the issue of large actual or potential discrepancies between aggregate savings and investment in countries or monetary zones , reflected in current-account imbalances , is at the heart of the IMF &apos;s emerging multilateral surveillance role ; it has been a focus of the G-20 as well . 
The G-20 &quot; mutual assessment process &quot; - established to analyze national economic policies &quot; effects on other countries and on global growth , with the goal of formulating individual adjustment commitments - has highlighted the difficulty of reaching agreement on macroeconomic policies with significant spillover effects . 
Indeed , it is even more difficult than reaching trade agreements , which must cover issues like tariffs , quotas , quality standards , regulatory regimes for particular sectors , and relevant microeconomic issues . 
Merging all of these challenging topics into a single negotiation process is a recipe for deadlock . 
A better approach would include strengthening the IMF &apos;s multilateral surveillance role . 
Doing so would broaden discussions of macroeconomic policy to include employment issues - specifically , the potential impact of large foreign-trade surpluses on domestic jobs .
