Europe &apos;s Precarious New Normal 
LONDON - A decade ago , ten countries joined the European Union . 
Today , Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , Poland , Slovakia , and Slovenia are universally recognized as fully integrated European countries . 
The extraordinary political transitions set in motion by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 , together with the mundane and drawn-out EU accession process that followed , produced this new normal - one essentially free from the political and economic distortions of the Cold War . 
Ukraine is now venturing down this path - without the promise of full accession . 
On this anniversary , with an era of geopolitical tension again descending on the European continent , it is worth reminding ourselves what the new normal has meant for the countries that joined the EU ten years ago - and what it could mean for Ukraine . 
Europe &apos;s &quot; missing middle , &quot; gouged out by the Iron Curtain , has been restored . 
Trade in the region has flourished , naturally gravitating toward the EU , the world &apos;s largest market . 
Investment has flowed in the opposite direction , from capital-rich to capital-poor countries , as economic theory would predict . 
Comparing Poland and Ukraine underscores the difference that EU membership has made . 
In 1989 , Poland and Ukraine had approximately the same standard of living ; today , Poles are three times richer . 
Poland &apos;s income gap with Western Europe today is smaller than it has been at any point since the year 1500 . 
Given that the EU &apos;s combined GDP is eight times larger than that of Russia , we should expect a path toward normality for Ukraine to mean that the EU would dominate the country &apos;s foreign trade . 
But this does not imply a complete break with Russia , whose weight in Polish exports has tripled since 2004 . 
Given their geographic proximity and industrial networks , the potential for trade between Russia and Ukraine is much greater . 
But the new normal is about democracy and dignity as well . It is hard to imagine that what is currently happening to the social fabric in eastern Ukraine could happen in Poland . 
EU accession has undoubtedly contributed to Poland &apos;s exceptional institutional transformation . 
Like Ukraine , Poland suffered from widespread corruption in the years immediately following the collapse of communism . 
But today it ranks better than many old EU members on corruption indicators . 
The painstaking approximation of EU rules and regulation that helped Poland become a normal European country by the late 1990 &quot; s would offer Ukraine the prospect of taming its own demons of bribery , cronyism , and nepotism . 
Moreover , Poland has benefited from access to massive EU funding , with more than â‚¬ 92 billion ( $ 128 billion ) pouring into the economy over the last ten years . 
Private-sector flows have been much larger throughout Central and Eastern Europe as well , owing to attractive conditions for foreign direct investment - much of it comprising long-term projects with associated benefits like knowledge transfer and the introduction of international best practices . 
Establishing this kind of normality in Ukraine could unleash massive transformational forces . 
But this aspiration , as we all know , is now in serious jeopardy . 
And the price of its extinction could be high , not only for Ukraine , but also for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe . 
For starters , with sanctions targeting Russia &apos;s floundering economy , revived trade ties are becoming a source of vulnerability for these countries . 
Already , companies active in the Russian market are reporting problems finding funding , and cross-border investments are being postponed . 
The impact goes beyond short-term trade and investment . 
Expensive quick fixes to increase energy security are crowding out other important priorities in Central and Eastern Europe , such as long-term investment in tertiary education and research , and much-needed improvements in dilapidated health-care systems . 
And the post-1989 &quot; peace dividend , &quot; which has helped create fiscal space , is evaporating , as countries in the region and beyond perceive a need to increase defense expenditures . 
As Europe &apos;s leaders mull over their next steps and consider how to respond , Ukrainians should consider carefully how much they would gain by moving down the path of economic and institutional reform toward European normality . 
At the same time , the countries of Central and Eastern Europe deserve the EU &apos;s support in their efforts to reduce their vulnerabilities .
