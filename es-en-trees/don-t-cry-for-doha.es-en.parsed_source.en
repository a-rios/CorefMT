Don &apos;t Cry for Doha 
CAMBRIDGE - Will they or won &apos;t they ? 
Will the world &apos;s trade ministers eventually sign a new multilateral trade agreement that reduces agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs , or will they walk away empty-handed ? 
The saga has been ongoing since November 2001 , when the current round of negotiations was launched in Doha , Qatar , with numerous subsequent ups and downs , near-collapses , and extensions . 
The latest round of talks in Geneva has once again failed to produce an agreement . Judging by what the financial press and some economists say , the stakes could not be higher . 
Conclude this so-called &quot; development round &quot; successfully , and you will lift hundreds of millions of farmers in poor countries out of poverty and ensure that globalization remains alive . 
Fail , and you will deal the world trading system a near-fatal blow , fostering disillusionment in the South and protectionism in the North . 
And , as the editorialists hasten to remind us , the downside is especially large at a time when the world &apos;s financial system is reeling under the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the United States is entering a recession . 
But look at the Doha agenda with a more detached set of eyes , and you wonder what all the fuss is about . 
True , farm-support policies in rich countries tend to depress world prices , along with the incomes of agricultural producers in developing countries . 
But for most farm products , the phasing out of these subsidies is likely to have only modest effects on world prices - at most a few percentage points . 
This is small potatoes compared to the significant run-up in prices that world markets have been experiencing recently , and it would in any case be swamped by the high volatility to which these markets are normally subject . 
While higher world farm prices help producers , they hurt urban households in developing countries , many of which are also poor . 
That is why the recent spike in food prices has led many food-growing countries to impose export restrictions and has caused near panic among those concerned about global poverty . 
It is hard to square these fears with the view that the Doha trade round could lift tens , if not hundreds , of millions out of poverty . 
The best that can be said is that farm reform in rich countries would be a mixed blessing for the world &apos;s poor . 
Clear-cut gains exist only for a few commodities , such as cotton and sugar , which are not consumed in large quantities by poor households . 
The big winners from farm reform in the US , the EU , and other rich countries would be their taxpayers and consumers , who have long paid for the subsidies and protections received by their farming compatriots . 
But make no mistake : what we are talking about here is domestic policy reform and an internal redistribution of income . 
This may be good on efficiency and even equity grounds . 
What about industrial tariffs ? 
Rich countries have demanded sharp cuts in import tariffs by developing countries such as India and Brazil in return for phasing out their farm subsidies . 
( Why they need to be bribed by poor countries to do what is good for them is an enduring mystery . ) 
But here , too , the potential benefits are slim . 
Applied tariff rates in developing countries , while higher than in advanced countries , are already at an all-time low . 
According to World Bank estimates , complete elimination of all merchandise trade restrictions would ultimately boost developing-country incomes by no more than 1 % . 
The impact on developed-country incomes would be even smaller . 
And , of course , the Doha Round would only reduce these barriers , not eliminate them altogether . 
The Doha Round was constructed on a myth , namely that a negotiating agenda focused on agriculture would constitute a &quot; development round . &quot; 
This gave key constituencies what they wanted . 
It gave the US a stick with which to tear down the EU &apos;s common agricultural policy . 
And it was tailor-made for the few middle-income developing countries ( such as Brazil , Argentina , and Thailand ) that are large agricultural exporters . 
But the myth of a &quot; development &quot; round , promoted by trade officials and economists who espouse the &quot; bicycle theory &quot; of trade negotiations - the view that the trade regime can remain upright only with continuous progress in liberalization - backfired , because the US and key developing countries found it difficult to liberalize their farm sectors . 
What ultimately led to the collapse of the latest round of negotiations was India &apos;s refusal to accept rigid rules that it felt would put India &apos;s agricultural smallholders in jeopardy . 
More importantly , the fears underlying the bicycle theory are wildly inflated . 
We live under the most liberal trade regime in history not because the WTO enforces it , but because important countries - rich and poor alike - find greater openness to be in their best interest . 
The real risks lie elsewhere . 
On one side is the danger that today &apos;s alarmism will prove self-fulfilling - that trade officials and investors will turn the doomsday scenario into reality by panicking . 
On the other side is the danger that a completed &quot; development round &quot; will fail to live up to the high expectations that it has spawned , further eroding the legitimacy of global trade rules over the longer run . 
In the end , it may well be the atmospherics - psychology and expectations - rather than the actual economic results on the ground that will determine the outcomes . 
So don &apos;t cry for Doha . 
It never was a development round , and tomorrow &apos;s world will hardly look any different from yesterday &apos;s .
