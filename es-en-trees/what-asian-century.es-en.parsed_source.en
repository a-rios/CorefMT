What Asian Century ? 
PARIS - It is almost taken for granted nowadays that this is to be the &quot; Asian Century , &quot; marking an irreversible political / economic shift in global power from West to East . 
China has replaced Germany as the world &apos;s leading exporter , while South Korea &apos;s Korean Electric recently outbid Electricit√© de France to build three nuclear reactors in Abu Dhabi . 
To be sure , Chinese trade statistics do not reflect the imports needed to assemble its exports , and the South Koreans &quot; reactor will use Westinghouse technology . 
But Asia &apos;s success should not be undersold , especially when one considers that Asia &apos;s governments have used the recent financial crisis wisely , as an opportunity to reinforce the free market mechanism . 
( South Korea , for example , simultaneously helped its poor and deregulated its labor market . ) 
The United States and Europe have not . 
Yet it is premature to proclaim an Asian Century . 
Perhaps the coastal areas of South Korea , Japan , Vietnam , and China &apos;s eastern seaboard share some common cultural characteristics and a similar economic strategy . 
Nor does Asia cohere politically ; parts of it are democratic , other parts are ruled by despots . 
Moreover , there is no &quot; Asian &quot; economic system : China &apos;s state capitalism does not belong to the same category as the private capitalism practiced in Japan and Korea . 
India remains largely an agricultural economy , dotted with small business and service-sector dynamism . 
Asia also has no decision center , nor coordinating institutions comparable to NATO or the European Union . 
This is important , because , whereas the West is relatively at peace with itself , Asia is riddled with actual conflicts ( within and around Pakistan ) and looming ones all around the South China Sea . 
Indeed , were NATO and the US military ever to leave Asia , the threat of war would increase , heavily disrupting trade , and Asia &apos;s economic dynamism would not survive . 
It is hard to believe in an Asia Century when Asia &apos;s security depends on non-Asian security forces . 
Another of Asia &apos;s relative weaknesses comes from its poor record on innovation , a fundamental building block of prolonged economic dynamism . 
Chinese exports ( up to now ) have contained little added value and a lot of cheap manpower , and the sophisticated products that it does produce , such as smart phones , have been conceived in the West . 
Japan and South Korea are much more creative , but they still often improve products and services initially invented in the West . 
Asia &apos;s lagging capacity for innovation is probably rooted in its rote education : Asian students , when they have the opportunity , flock to North American and European universities . 
In many ways , Asia &apos;s undeniable progress reflects its conversion to Western values . 
Capitalism , democracy , individualism , gender equality , and secularism are Western notions that have been adopted in Asia . 
True , there are backlashes in Asia against Westernization , and some try to promote so-called Asian values , such as the &quot; harmony principle . &quot; 
But these attempts are weakened by their underlying political motivation . 
The idea of harmony , for example , is a rich philosophical concept in classic Buddhism and Confucianism . 
One also regrets that not much is done in India to keep alive the philosophy and spirit of Mahatma Gandhi , one of Asia &apos;s few twentieth-century universal thinkers . 
The prophecy of an Asian Century also ignores all of Asia &apos;s disorderly and declining nations , such as Thailand and Japan , respectively . 
But it cannot rely only on some local economic breakthrough without any broader cultural and strategic underpinning . 
The fragility of Asia does not mean that Western domination is guaranteed : with its universities , cultural values , entertainment industry , and strong military , the West keeps an edge , but maybe not forever . 
More probably , while we try to compare the relative power of the West and the East , we are clinging to an obsolete vocabulary . 
Our criteria belong to the past . 
After all , there is no such thing as an autonomous &quot; national economy &quot; nowadays . 
Almost all products and services are global . The more sophisticated a product or service is , the more its national identity tends to disappear . 
There are no peculiarly Western or Eastern mobile phones or financial derivatives . 
When China buys US Treasury bills , who depends on whom ? 
When Asia grows , the West does not become poorer . 
From now on , we progress together , or we do not progress at all . 
Similarly , there is no contradiction between the West and Asia when it comes to threats to global security , like terrorism or nuclear rogue states . 
Pop culture is perhaps the clearest example of this universality . 
Korean rock singers are extremely popular in China . 
Are they Korean or American ? 
More probably , they are global . 
So we have not entered the Asian Century ; we have entered the first Global Century . 
But global civilization is such a new phenomenon that we do not yet fully understand what is happening to each of us : we cling to old concepts in order to describe our emerging world . 
It may not be a better world , but it will be a very different one .
