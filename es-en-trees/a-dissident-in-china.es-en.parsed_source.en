A Dissident in China 
TOKYO - 2009 was a good year for China . 
The Chinese economy still roared ahead in the midst of a worldwide recession . 
American President Barack Obama visited China , more in the spirit of a supplicant to an imperial court than the leader of the world &apos;s greatest superpower . 
Even the Copenhagen summit on climate change ended just the way China wanted : failure in its attempt to commit China , or any other industrial nation , to making significant cuts in carbon emissions , with the United States getting the blame . 
The Chinese government , under the Communist Party , has every reason to feel confident . 
So why did a gentle former literature professor named Liu Xiaobo have to be sentenced to 11 years in prison , just because he publicly advocated freedom of expression and an end to one-party rule ? 
Liu was co-author in 2008 of a petition , Charter 08 , signed by thousands of Chinese , calling for basic rights to be respected . 
Liu is not a violent rebel . 
His opinions , in articles published on the Internet , are entirely peaceful . 
Yet he was jailed for &quot; inciting subversion of state power . &quot; 
The notion that Liu might be capable of subverting the immense power of the Communist Party of China is patently absurd . 
And yet the authorities clearly believe that they had to make an example of him , to prevent others from expressing similar views . 
Why does a regime that appears to be so secure consider mere opinions , or even peaceful petitions , so dangerous ? 
Perhaps because the regime does not feel as secure as it looks . 
Without legitimacy , no government can rule with any sense of confidence . 
There are many ways to legitimize political arrangements . 
Liberal democracy is only a recent invention . 
Hereditary monarchy , often backed by divine authority , has worked in the past . 
And some modern autocrats , such as Robert Mugabe , have been bolstered by their credentials as national freedom fighters . 
China has changed a great deal in the last century , but it has remained the same in one respect : it is still ruled by a religious concept of politics . 
Legitimacy is not based on the give and take , the necessary compromises , and the wheeling and dealing that form the basis of an economic concept of politics such as that which underpins liberal democracy . 
Instead , the foundation of religious politics is a shared belief , imposed from above , in ideological orthodoxy . 
In imperial China , this meant Confucian orthodoxy . 
The ideal of the Confucian state is &quot; harmony . &quot; 
If all people conform to a particular set of beliefs , including moral codes of behavior , conflicts will disappear . 
The ruled , in this ideal system , will naturally obey their rulers , just as sons obey their fathers . 
After the various revolutions in the early decades of the twentieth century , Confucianism was replaced by a Chinese version of Communism . 
Marxism appealed to Chinese intellectuals , because it was bookish , introduced a modern moral orthodoxy , and was based , like Confucianism , on a promise of perfect harmony . 
Ultimately , in the Communist utopia , conflicts of interests would melt away . 
Chairman Mao &apos;s rule combined elements of the Chinese imperial system with Communist totalitarianism . 
This orthodoxy , however , was also destined to fade away . 
Few Chinese , even in the top ranks of the Communist Party , are convinced Marxists anymore . 
This left an ideological vacuum , swiftly filled in the 1980 &quot; s by greed , cynicism , and corruption . 
Out of this crisis came the demonstrations all over China , collectively known as &quot; Tiananmen . &quot; 
Liu Xiaobo was an active spokesman in 1989 for the student protests against official corruption and in favor of greater freedom . 
Soon after the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen , a new orthodoxy replaced Chinese Marxism : Chinese nationalism . 
Only one-party rule would guarantee the continuing rise of China and put an end to centuries of national humiliation . 
The Communist Party represented China &apos;s destiny as a great power . 
To doubt this was not just mistaken , but unpatriotic , even &quot; anti-Chinese . &quot; 
From this perspective , Liu Xiaobo &apos;s critical views were indeed subversive . 
They cast doubt on the official orthodoxy , and thus on the legitimacy of the state . 
To wonder , as many have , why the Chinese regime refused to negotiate with the students in 1989 - or to find some accommodation with its critics today - is to misunderstand the nature of religious politics . 
Negotiation , compromise , and accommodation are the marks of economic politics , where every deal has its price . 
By contrast , those who rule according to a shared belief cannot afford to negotiate , for that would undermine the belief itself . 
This is not to say that the economic concept of politics is utterly strange to the Chinese - or , for that matter , that the religious notion of politics is unknown in the democratic West . 
But the insistence on orthodoxy is still sufficiently strong in China to remain the default defense against political critics . 
These things can change . 
Other Confucian societies , such as South Korea , Taiwan , and Japan , now have thriving liberal democracies , and there is no reason to believe that such a transition is impossible in China . 
But external pressure is unlikely to bring it about . 
Many non-Chinese , including me , have signed a letter of protest against the jailing of Liu Xiaobo . 
One hopes that this will lend comfort to him , and give a moral boost to Chinese who share his views . 
But it is unlikely to impress those who believe in the current orthodoxy of Chinese nationalism . 
Until China is released from the grip of religious politics , Liu &apos;s ideals are unlikely to take root . 
This does not bode well for China , or , indeed , for the rest of the world .
