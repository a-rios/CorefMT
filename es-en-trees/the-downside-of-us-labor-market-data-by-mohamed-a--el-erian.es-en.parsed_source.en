America &apos;s Labor Market by the Numbers 
NEWPORT BEACH - Politicians and economists now join investors in a ritual that typically takes place on the first Friday of each month and has important consequences for global markets : anticipating , internalizing , and reacting to the monthly employment report released by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) . 
Over the last few years , the report has evolved in a significant way - not only providing an assessment of the economy &apos;s past and current state , but , increasingly , containing insights into its future as well . 
Think of the BLS &apos;s employment report as a comprehensive monthly check-up for the American labor market . 
Among its many interesting statistics , it tells you how many jobs are created and where ; how earnings and hours worked are evolving ; and the number , age , and education of those seeking employment . 
Despite the data &apos;s richness , only two indicators consistently attract widespread attention : net monthly job creation ( which amounted to 169,000 in August ) and the unemployment rate ( 7.3 % in August , the lowest since December 2008 ) . 
Together they point to a gradual and steady improvement in overall labor-market conditions . 
This is certainly good news . 
It is not long ago that job creation was negative and the unemployment rate stood at 10 % . 
The problem is that the headline numbers shed only partial light on what may lie ahead . 
The figure for monthly job creation , for example , is distorted by the growing importance of part-time employment , and it fails to convey the reality of stagnant earnings . 
Meanwhile , the headline unemployment rate does not reflect the growing number of Americans who have left the work force - a phenomenon vividly reflected by the decline in the labor participation rate to just 63.2 % , a 35-year low . 
To get a real sense of the labor market &apos;s health , we need to look elsewhere in the BLS &apos;s report . 
What these other numbers have to tell us - about both the present and the future - is far from reassuring . 
Consider the statistics on the duration of unemployment . 
After all , the longer one is unemployed , the harder it is to find a full-time job at a decent wage . 
In August , the BLS classified 4.3 million Americans as long-term unemployed , or 37.9 % of the total unemployed - a worrisome figure , given that the global financial crisis was five years ago . 
And , remember , this number excludes all the discouraged Americans who are no longer looking for a job . 
In fact , the more comprehensive employment / population ratio stands at only 58.6 % . 
The teenage-unemployment rate is another under-appreciated indicator that is at an alarming level . 
At 22.7 % , too many American teenagers , lacking steady work experience early in their professional careers , risk going from unemployed to unemployable . 
Then there are the indicators that link educational attainment and employment status . 
Most notable here is the growing gap between those with a college degree ( where the unemployment rate is only 3.5 % ) and those lacking a high school diploma ( 11.3 % ) . 
Rather than confirming the paradigm of gradual and steady improvement , these disaggregated numbers attest to a highly segmented , multi-speed labor market - one with features that could become more deeply embedded in the structure of the economy . 
If current trends persist , the BLS &apos;s report will continue to evolve from a snapshot of the past and present to a preview of the future . 
Undoubtedly , the US labor market &apos;s uneven recovery has much to do with the structural and policy gaps exposed by the 2008 global financial crisis and the recession that followed . 
The economy is still struggling to provide a sufficient number of jobs for those who were previously employed in leverage-driven activities that are no longer sustainable ( let alone desirable ) . 
Moreover , US schools , particularly at the primary and secondary levels , continue to slip down the global scale , constraining Americans &quot; ability to benefit from globalization . 
Meanwhile , existing and newly created jobs provide less of an earnings upside . 
And political polarization narrows the scope for effective tactical and structural policy responses . 
This combination of factors is particularly burdensome for the most vulnerable segments of the US population - particularly those with limited educational attainment , first-time labor-market entrants , and those who have been out of work for an extended period . 
So while net job creation will continue and the unemployment rate will maintain its downward trajectory - both highly welcome - the labor market &apos;s evolution risks fueling rather than countering already-significant income and wealth inequalities , as well as poverty . 
Overburdened social support mechanisms would thus come under even greater pressure . 
And all of this would amplify rather than attenuate political polarization , placing other urgent policy priorities at even greater risk . 
If this interpretation is correct , the heightened attention given to the monthly BLS headline indicators needs to be accompanied by a broader analysis and a different mindset . 
After all , the report is much more than a scorecard on America &apos;s performance in confronting a persistent economic , political , and social challenge ; it is also an urgent call for a more focused corrective effort involving both government and business . 
A better mix of fiscal and monetary policies and sustained measures to enhance productivity and competitiveness remain necessary conditions for addressing America &apos;s labor-market challenges . 
But they are not sufficient . 
Both the public and private sectors - individually and through scalable and durable partnerships - need to think much more seriously about labor retraining and retooling programs , enhanced labor mobility , vocational training , and internships . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s appointment of a &quot; jobs czar &quot; would also help to enhance the credibility , accountability , and coordination required to overcome today &apos;s significant and rising employment challenges . 
Yes , the headline numbers will continue to signal overall improvement in the labor market . 
The urgent task now is to ensure that lasting progress is not undermined by the worrisome compositional trends that the BLS &apos;s report highlights month after month .
