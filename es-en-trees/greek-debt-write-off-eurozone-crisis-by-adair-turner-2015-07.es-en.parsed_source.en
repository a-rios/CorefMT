Greece for Grownups 
LONDON - Greece and its European partners may have agreed on a new bailout provision , but how the Greek economic tragedy will actually end remains a mystery . 
One thing , however , is certain : eurozone governments will end up writing off a large proportion of their loans to Greece . 
Their refusal to recognize that reality has increased the losses they will suffer . 
To be sure , the Greek government has , at times , been provocative and unrealistic , failing to accept , for example , the need for serious pension reform . 
But the eurozone authorities &quot; refusal to accept the need for debt relief has been equally divorced from reality . 
Three weeks ago , International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde &apos;s called for talks to resume &quot; with adults in the room . &quot; 
That means facing facts . 
In this sense , the IMF &apos;s latest Debt Sustainability Analysis , published on June 26 , is a grown-up document . 
It makes clear that Greece &apos;s debts will not be sustainable without further concessional loans and an extension of existing debt maturities ; perhaps , it suggests , a write-off of some € 50 billion ( $ 55 billion ) will also be needed . 
But even these calculations are based on unrealistic assumptions . 
Previous bailout agreements presumed that Greece would run a primary budget surplus ( before interest payments ) of 4.5 % of GDP pretty much permanently . 
The IMF has revised that assumption downward , to 3.5 % . 
But this still ignores the reality that Greeks can walk away from their debts - not only metaphorically , by defaulting , but also literally , by migrating to Germany , for instance . 
As long as Greece remains a member of the European Union , its taxpayers can walk away , just as Detroit &apos;s did in the decades before its bankruptcy . 
If remaining in Greece means living in a country where taxes are always 10 % higher than public expenditures , many - especially the young and talented - will do just that . 
It has been clear for five years that Greece &apos;s debts are unsustainable . 
It was also obvious that the private-sector debt write-down of 2012 would have to be followed by an official one . 
But the eurozone authorities refused to offer debt relief to the previous Greek government , and instead imposed more severe austerity than was necessary . 
As a consequence , Greece &apos;s recession deepened ; its already-unsustainable debt swelled further ; and the anti-austerity Syriza party rose to power . 
The prolonged uncertainty drove Greeks to withdraw their bank deposits , the cash for which came from the € 90 billion of emergency liquidity assistance provided by the European Central Bank . 
That money will be re-denominated in devalued new drachmas if Greece leaves the eurozone . 
In promising that Germany would suffer no debt write-off , Chancellor Angela Merkel made a promise she couldn &apos;t keep . 
Worse , by maintaining that stubborn position , eurozone negotiators have ensured that the eventual write-offs will be even larger . 
That negotiating position might still be rational if bigger eventual Greek write-offs would be offset by reduced write-offs elsewhere or at another time . 
After all , if Greece receives debt relief Ireland or Spain might demand the same , and all eurozone governments would have a weaker incentive to adhere to fiscal discipline in the future . 
A rational banker might deliberately provoke bankruptcy and suffer larger write-offs than necessary , in order to teach lessons and create better future incentives . 
But Greece is not just another debtor . 
It is a potentially fragile state on the edge of a Europe that is facing a massive migration crisis and a dangerously nationalistic Russian leadership looking for opportunities to cause trouble . 
The eurozone must find a way to ensure future debt discipline , without provoking an even deeper crisis in Greece . 
Even in the United States , imposing fiscal discipline on sub-federal entities is often difficult . 
However clear their non-guaranteed status , financially distressed cities or states - whether New York in the 1970s or Puerto Rico today - can put serious pressure on national political leaders to offer assistance . 
In the eurozone , the links between governments and national banking systems make market discipline even more difficult to achieve . 
Imagine if one were to suggest that banks operating in Illinois should be required to hold large portfolios of Illinois state bonds , with their deposits insured by an Illinois state insurance scheme , and the Illinois state government responsible for recapitalization , if needed . 
The proposal would be dismissed as economic lunacy . 
In such a system , a recession would create a self-reinforcing spiral of deteriorating public finances , rising fears of bank insolvency , and declining credit extension . 
And yet , if you replace &quot; Illinois &quot; with Ireland , Spain , or Greece , that is how things work in the eurozone . 
This system has made a market-based approach to addressing unsustainable debts impossible . 
Rather than risking write-offs of government or bank debt , eurozone governments and the ECB absorbed the debts that were initially extended by the private sector onto the public balance sheets of the eurozone &apos;s member states . 
In Ireland and Spain , the private sector escaped scot-free . 
In Greece , there was some &quot; private-sector involvement &quot; ; but many irresponsible lenders still managed to pass on their exposures to eurozone governments . 
To ensure future fiscal discipline , the eurozone must disentangle its banks from national governments and create a true banking union . 
High equity requirements or tight quantitative limits should be used to restrict banks &quot; holdings of national government bonds ; banks should instead hold liquid assets in the form of eurozone-level bonds , bills , or cash reserves at the ECB . 
And national public debt should be held by the non-bank private sector , which should suffer large write-downs if debt rises to unsustainable levels . 
The desirable effect would be that governments would find it harder to accumulate debts they could not afford . 
But appropriate future reforms cannot change the fact that , today , Greece &apos;s debts are unsustainable . 
Adult negotiators have to face two realities : large debt write-offs are inevitable , and punishing Greece further will not put the eurozone on the path to financial discipline . 
For that , systemic reform is essential .
