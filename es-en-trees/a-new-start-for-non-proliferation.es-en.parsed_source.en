A New Start for Non-Proliferation 
VIENNA - US President Barack Obama has injected fresh momentum into efforts - stalled for a decade - to bring about nuclear disarmament . 
He has committed himself to the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and acknowledges the link between nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament by the nuclear-weapon states . 
Obama has pledged to revitalize the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons . 
The non-proliferation regime , of which the NPT is the cornerstone , is in disarray . 
The main problems are easily identified . 
First , the five main nuclear-weapon states have not taken seriously their NPT obligation to work for nuclear disarmament . 
Instead , they have insisted that nuclear weapons are essential for their security and continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals . 
This naturally robs them of the moral authority to persuade others not to acquire nuclear weapons , which continue to be perceived as a source of power and influence , and an insurance policy against attack . 
Second , as we have seen in the case of North Korea , there is nothing to stop countries that sign the Treaty from simply walking out after declaring that &quot; extraordinary events &quot; have jeopardized their supreme interests . 
Third , the International Atomic Energy Agency , which is supposed to police the non-proliferation system , is shamefully underfunded . 
When it comes to determining whether or not a country is conducting a covert nuclear weapons program , IAEA inspectors often have their hands tied , either because they lack the legal authority to gain access to all the locations they consider necessary , or because the IAEA &apos;s analytical laboratories are outdated , or because the Agency does not have adequate access to satellite imagery . 
Fourth , export controls have failed to prevent the spread of sensitive nuclear technology , not least due to the sophisticated efforts of clandestine networks like the one run by Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan . 
Nine countries already have nuclear weapons , and it would be naive to presume that others , particularly in regions of conflict , will not try to get hold of them . 
In addition , a number of countries with nuclear energy programs have the capability , if they choose , to manufacture nuclear weapons within a matter of months if their security perceptions change , because they have mastered the critical technology - uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing . 
If more countries take this path , it could prove to be the Achilles &quot; heel of non-proliferation . 
Fifth , the international community , spearheaded by the United Nations Security Council , has more often than not been paralyzed in the face of challenges to international security and ineffectual in responding to suspected cases of nuclear proliferation . 
These issues will not be resolved overnight . 
But there is much that can be done relatively quickly . 
The United States and Russia have started negotiations on deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals , which together account for 95 % of the world &apos;s 27,000 warheads . 
Other key steps include bringing into force the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty ; negotiating a verifiable treaty to end production of fissile material for use in weapons ; radically improving the physical security of nuclear and radioactive materials , which is vital to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists ; and strengthening the IAEA . 
Last month , I proposed a key measure to strengthen non-proliferation to the IAEA &apos;s Board of Governors - establishing an IAEA bank of low-enriched uranium ( LEU ) to guarantee supplies to countries that need nuclear fuel for their power reactors . 
LEU cannot be used to make weapons . 
Some such mechanism will be essential in the coming decades as more and more countries introduce nuclear energy . 
My proposal is to create a physical stockpile of LEU at the disposal of the IAEA as a last-resort reserve for countries with nuclear power programs that face a supply disruption for non-commercial reasons . 
This would give countries confidence that they can count on reliable supplies of fuel to run their nuclear power plants , and therefore do not need to develop their own uranium-enrichment or plutonium-reprocessing capability . 
This could help to avoid a repeat of Iran &apos;s experiences after its 1979 revolution , when contracts for fuel and technology for its planned nuclear power program were not honored . 
Thirty years later , some of the consequences are still being felt . 
The LEU would be available to countries in need on the basis of non-political and non-discriminatory criteria . 
It would be accessible at market prices to all states in compliance with their nuclear safeguards obligations . 
No state would be required to give up the right to develop its own fuel cycle . 
The money needed to launch an LEU bank is in place , thanks primarily to a non-governmental organization - the Nuclear Threat Initiative - and initial funding from Warren Buffett . 
But this can only be a first step . 
It should be followed by an agreement that all new enrichment and reprocessing activities will be placed exclusively under multinational control , and that all existing such facilities will be converted from national to multinational control . 
This is a bold idea , but bold ideas are needed now more than ever . 
The opportunity to put the nuclear fuel cycle under multinational control was missed 60 years ago because of the Cold War . 
The spread of nuclear technology and the growing risk of nuclear terrorism make it imperative that we get it right this time .
