Hopeless Unemployment 
BERKELEY - However bad you think the global economy is today in terms of the business cycle , that is only one lens through which to view the world . 
In terms of global life expectancy , total world wealth , the overall level of technology , growth prospects in emerging economies , and global income distribution , things look rather good , while on still other dimensions - say , global warming or domestic income inequality and its effects on countries &quot; social solidarity - they look bad . 
Even on the business-cycle dimension , conditions have been far worse in the past than they are today . 
Consider the Great Depression and the implications of market economies &quot; inability back then to recover on their own , owing to the burden of long-term unemployment . 
But , while we are not at that point today , the Great Depression is no less relevant for us , because it is increasingly likely that long-term unemployment will become a similar impediment to recovery within the next two years . 
At its nadir in the winter of 1933 , the Great Depression was a form of collective insanity . 
Workers were idle because firms would not hire them ; firms would not hire them because they saw no market for their output ; and there was no market for output because workers had no incomes to spend . 
By that point , a great deal of unemployment had become long-term unemployment , which had two consequences . 
First , the burden of economic dislocation was borne unequally . 
Because consumer prices fell faster than wages , the welfare of those who remained employed rose in the Great Depression . 
Overwhelmingly , those who became and remained unemployed suffered the most . 
Second , reintegrating the unemployed even into a smoothly functioning market economy would prove to be very difficult . 
After all , how many employers would not prefer a fresh entrant into the labor force to someone who has been out of work for years ? 
The simple fact that an economy had recently undergone a period of mass unemployment made it difficult to recover levels of growth and employment that are often attained as a matter of course . 
Devalued exchange rates , moderate government budget deficits , and the passage of time all appeared to be equally ineffective remedies . 
Highly centralized and unionized labor markets , like Australia &apos;s , did as poorly as decentralized and laissez-faire labor markets , like that of the United States , in dealing with long-term unemployment . 
Fascist solutions were equally unsuccessful , as in Italy , unless accompanied by rapid rearmament , as in Germany . 
In the end , in the US , it was the approach of World War II and the associated demand for military goods that led private-sector employers to hire the long-term unemployed at wages they would accept . 
But , even today , economists can provide no clear explanation of why the private sector could not find ways to employ the long-term unemployed in the near-decade from the winter of 1933 to full war mobilization . 
The extent of persistent unemployment , despite different labor-market structures and national institutions , suggests that theories that pinpoint one key failure should be taken with a grain of salt . 
At first , the long-term unemployed in the Great Depression searched eagerly and diligently for alternative sources of work . 
But , after six months or so passed without successful reemployment , they tended to become discouraged and distraught . 
After 12 months of continuous unemployment , the typical unemployed worker still searched for a job , but in a desultory fashion , without much hope . 
And , after two years of unemployment , the worker , accurately expecting to be at the end of every hiring queue , had lost hope and , for all practical purposes , left the labor market . 
This was the pattern of the long-term unemployed in the Great Depression . 
It was also the pattern of the long-term unemployed in Western Europe at the end of the 1980s . 
And , in a year or two , it will be the pattern again for the long-term unemployed in the North Atlantic region . 
I have been arguing for four years that our business-cycle problems call for more aggressively expansionary monetary and fiscal policies , and that our biggest problems would quickly melt away were such policies to be adopted . 
That is still true . 
The current balance of probabilities is that two years from now , the North Atlantic &apos;s principal labor-market failures will not be demand-side market failures that could be easily remedied by more aggressive policies to boost economic activity and employment . 
Rather , they will be structural market failures of participation that are not amenable to any straightforward and easily implemented cure .
