Venezuelans Test Democracy 
After enormous difficulties , uncertainties , and constant attempts to derail the process , Venezuelans will vote on August 15th to decide whether President Hugo Chávez should be recalled and new presidential elections held . 
This plebiscite marks the latest stage in a bitter campaign to unseat a president who has already survived a coup , a two-month general strike , and a previous attempt to force a vote on his leadership . 
Chávez himself appears to have tacitly , if reluctantly , accepted that the recall vote will be held this August . 
So is he on the way out ? 
Not necessarily . 
But , no matter what happens , the battle between Chávez and the opposition has already tested - and will continue to test - the strength of Venezuela &apos;s democracy . 
Independent supervision of the referendum must be agreed upon soon . 
The Organization of American States and the Atlanta-based Carter Center , named for former US President Jimmy Carter , have been active in facilitating the process . 
Together with a group of friendly countries , the OAS and the Carter Center helped convince Chávez of the inevitability of a recall vote . 
It is to be hoped that similar external cooperation can ensure that the mid-August poll is conducted fairly , so that the results reflect the will of Venezuelan voters . 
Although Chávez has railed against outside interference in the referendum , he surely understands that its legitimacy needs to be guaranteed in the eyes of a watchful foreign press and other international observers . 
One only has to look at the fight Chávez put up to stall the August vote to understand that neither he nor the opposition will give up easily . 
Earlier in the year , Chávez &apos;s government brazenly attempted to disqualify hundreds of thousands of citizens who had gone to the polls in support of the referendum . 
He followed this with government-inspired reprisals and threats to punish anyone who favored the recall . 
Nevertheless , for two days in May , Venezuelans whose previous vote had been questioned on technical grounds returned to ratify their decision . 
If enough people agree on August 15 to unseat Chávez , new presidential elections will follow in 30 days . 
The winner of that vote will then serve out the remainder of Chávez &apos;s term , which the Supreme Court has extended until February of 2007 . 
The date of the recall referendum is crucial . 
If it had been scheduled for after August 19 , there would have been no prospect of fresh elections until 2007 , because if the recall won , the vice-president would have taken over . 
But the opposition &apos;s task is far from finished . 
It will need to mobilize a higher number of votes to force Chávez out of office than it collected to trigger the referendum . 
Chávez , no doubt , will cast himself as an opponent of the plutocracy that once ruled the country with the backing of the traditional , and highly corrupt , political parties . 
Anti-Americanism could also rally support to his side . 
For its part , the opposition still lacks clear leadership and a single leader who can offer a clear alternative to Chávez and mobilize voters . 
Even if the opposition wins the recall , a new election might return Chávez to the presidency precisely because of this failing . 
The opposition must also contend with recent experience in Haiti . 
There , democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was thrown out under visible American pressure , but his departure failed to reinvigorate the economy or end civil strife . 
Nor can the risk of violent clashes between pro- and anti-Chávez forces be ruled out . 
Chávez has strong support among the poor , who reacted with fury when he was overthrown two years ago . 
Although physical confrontation has largely been avoided , there is no assurance that his supporters will not take to the streets in the event of a defeat . 
As for Chávez , he does not want to be branded a dictator . 
Both he and the opposition know that the result of the plebiscite is not a foregone conclusion . 
Much will depend on who chooses to vote . 
Of course , Chávez has a few cards up his sleeve - including how to phrase the recall question itself . 
While events in Venezuela may look chaotic from afar , they are in fact democracy at work . 
The direct participation of broad segments of Venezuelan society is very different from the traditional methods employed to overthrow governments in our region . 
Whichever way the vote goes , Venezuela will have shown the region that democracy can work , which is a milestone in a Latin America too often shaken in the recent past by military coups , foreign intervention , and civil wars .
