China &apos;s Short March 
BEIJING - China &apos;s government is making massive preparations for a grand National Day parade in Beijing &apos;s Tiananmen Square to celebrate both the 60th anniversary of the PRC &apos;s founding and the 30th anniversary of Deng Xiaoping &apos;s program of &quot; reform and opening up . &quot; 
Walking through the square the other evening , I found myself thinking back to when I first began following China &apos;s amazing odyssey . 
The iconic , Mona Lisa-like visage of Chairman Mao still gazes out from the Gate of Heavenly Peace , but what was happening all around me suggested how much things had changed . 
When I first began studying China at Harvard a half-century ago , China &apos;s leaders trumpeted the superiority of their socialist command economy , which controlled every aspect of life . 
Hostility between the United States and China , however , prevented students like me from actually traveling there . 
But in 1975 , while Mao still lived , the Cultural Revolution still raged , class politics still held sway , and there were no private cars , shops , advertisements , or private property , I arrived in Beijing . 
Even we visiting foreigners - all dutifully clad in blue Mao suits and caps - were expected to attend regular political &quot; study sessions &quot; to purify our bourgeois minds with proletarian tracts written by the Gang of Four . 
That trip set an indelible baseline against which I have since been able to measure all the changes China has undergone . 
As Deng Xiaoping began to encourage individual incentives over the next several decades - embodied in such slogans as , &quot; To Get Rich Is Glorious &quot; - I watched with wonder and amazement as China &apos;s private economy began to rise from the ashes of Mao &apos;s revolution . 
As this process unfolded , it became fashionable for market fundamentalists in the West to bask in a sense of vindication . 
After all , were the scales not falling away from the eyes of Chinese leaders , and were they not now turning for salvation toward the God of capitalism that they had once so militantly denounced ? 
This &quot; end-of-history &quot; interlude , when &quot; Communism &quot; was either failing or recycling itself into its opposite , also encouraged many latter-day American political missionaries to proselytize for democracy as well as capitalism - to urge China &apos;s leaders to abandon state controls not only over their economy , but over their political system as well . 
Of course , China &apos;s leaders vigorously resisted that evangelism , especially after the collapse of communism in Europe in 1989 , often berating the West for &quot; intruding in the internal affairs of China &quot; and clinging even more defiantly to their Leninist , one-party form of governance . 
As the imbalance between China &apos;s ever more dynamic , modern , and globalized economy and its opaque , single-party system of political rule deepened , many Western specialists predicted that the contradiction would inevitably trip China up . 
Instead , it was America and the West that went into an economic tailspin . 
When , after the eight catastrophic years of George W. Bush &apos;s presidency , Barack Obama entered the White House , it seemed for a moment as if America might be able to arrest its downward slide . 
But then an unwelcome thing happened . 
Obama ran right into a perfect storm of the worst aspects of American democracy : red-state provincialism and ignorance , fearful conservatism , Republican Party obstructionism and even some Democratic Party dissidence . 
The US Congress became paralyzed by partisan politics . 
Seemingly lacking a central nervous system , it has become a dysfunctional creature with little capacity to recognize any common national , much less international , interest . 
Under such circumstances , even a brilliant leader , with an able staff and promising policies , will be unable to pursue his agenda . 
As governments across the West have become increasingly bogged down trying to fix a broken economy , China has been formulating a whole series of new , well-considered policies and forging ahead with bold decision-making to tackle one daunting problem after another . 
Triumphant from the 2008 Olympic Games , its leaders have undertaken the most impressive infrastructure program in history , implemented a highly successful economic stimulus package , and now are moving into the forefront of green technology , renewable energy , and energy efficiency - the activities out of which the new global economy is certain to grow . 
In short , China is veritably humming with energy , money , plans , leadership , and forward motion , while the West seems paralyzed . 
As I strolled through Tiananmen Square , the paradox that struck me was that the very system of democratic capitalism that the West has so ardently believed in and advocated now seems to be failing us . 
At the same time , the kind of authoritarianism and state-managed economics that we have long impugned now seems to be serving China well . 
It is intellectually and politically unsettling to realize that , if the West cannot quickly straighten out its systems of government , only politically un-reformed states like China will be able to make the decisions that a nation needs to survive in today &apos;s high-speed , high-tech , increasingly globalized world .
