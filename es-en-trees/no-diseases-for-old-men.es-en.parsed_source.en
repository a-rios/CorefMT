No Diseases for Old Men 
PRINCETON - Pneumonia used to be called &quot; the old man &apos;s friend &quot; because it often brought a fairly swift and painless end to a life that was already of poor quality and would otherwise have continued to decline . 
Now a study of severely demented patients in Boston-area nursing homes shows that the &quot; friend &quot; is often being fought with antibiotics . 
Such practices raise the obvious question : are we routinely treating illnesses because we can , rather than because we ought to ? 
The study , carried out by Erika D &apos;Agata and Susan Mitchell and recently published in the Archives of Internal Medicine , showed that over 18 months , two-thirds of 214 severely demented patients were treated with antibiotics . 
The mean age of these patients was 85 . 
On the Test for Severe Impairment , where scores can range from zero to 24 , three-quarters of these patients scored zero . 
Their ability to communicate verbally ranged from non-existent to minimal . 
It isn &apos;t clear that using antibiotics in these circumstances prolongs life , but even if it did , one would have to ask : what is the point ? 
How many people want their lives to be prolonged if they are incontinent , need to be fed by others , can no longer walk , and their mental capacities have irreversibly deteriorated so that they can neither speak nor recognize their children ? 
In many cases , the antibiotics were administered intravenously , which can cause discomfort . 
The interests of patients should come first , but when it is dubious that continued treatment is in a patient &apos;s interests and there is no way to find out what the patients wants , or would have wanted , it is reasonable to consider other factors , including the views of the family and the cost to the community . 
Medicare costs for beneficiaries with Alzheimer &apos;s disease were $ 91 billion in 2005 , and are expected to increase to $ 160 billion by 2010 . 
( For comparison , in 2005 the United States spent $ 27 billion on foreign aid . ) 
Moreover , D &apos;Agata and Mitchell suggest that the use of so many antibiotics by patients with dementia carries a different kind of cost : it exacerbates the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria , putting other patients at risk . 
Pneumonia also has not been able to play its friendly role for 84-year-old Samuel Golubchuk of Winnipeg , Canada , who for years has had limited physical and mental capacities as a result of a brain injury . 
Golubchuk &apos;s doctors thought it best not to prolong his life , but his children , arguing that discontinuing life-support would violate their Orthodox Jewish beliefs , obtained a court order compelling the doctors to keep their father alive . 
So , for the past three months , Golubchuk has had a tube down his throat to help him breathe and another in his stomach to feed him . 
He does not speak or get out of bed . 
How much awareness he has is in dispute . 
His case will now go to trial , and how long that will take is unclear . 
Normally , when patients are unable to make decisions about their treatment , the family &apos;s wishes should be given great weight . 
But a family &apos;s wishes should not override doctors &quot; ethical responsibility to act in the best interests of their patients . 
Golubchuk &apos;s children argue that he interacts with them . 
But establishing their father &apos;s awareness could be a double-edged sword , since it could also mean that keeping him alive is pointless torture , and it is in his best interests to be allowed to die peacefully . 
The other important issue raised by Golubchuk &apos;s case is how far a publicly-funded health care system such as Canada &apos;s has to go to satisfy the family &apos;s wishes . 
When a family seeks treatment that , in the professional judgment of the physicians , is not in the patient &apos;s best interests , the answer should be : not far at all . 
If Golubchuk &apos;s children can convince the court that their father is not suffering , the court might reasonably order the hospital to grant them custody of their father . 
They can then decide for themselves , at their own expense , how much further treatment he should have . 
What the court should not do is order the hospital to continue to care for Golubchuk against the better judgment of its health care professionals . 
Canada &apos;s taxpayers are not required to support the religious beliefs held by their fellow-citizens .
