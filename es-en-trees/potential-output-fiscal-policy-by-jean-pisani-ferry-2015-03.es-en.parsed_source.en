Unnecessary Instability 
PARIS - In normal life , technicalities are better left to technicians . 
A car owner does not need - or usually want - to bother to find out what exactly goes on under the hood . 
But when the car breaks down , he or she often has no choice . 
What is true of cars applies to the economy : arcane issues are for specialists . 
Yet in recent years , topics about which most people had never heard or cared - for example , securitization , credit default swaps , and the European payment system known as Target 2 - have imposed themselves on public debate , forcing ordinary people to grapple with their intricacies . 
The same has started to happen with the notion of &quot; potential output growth . &quot; 
Originally a concept created by economists for economists , its use for determining when , and by how much , a public deficit must be corrected is becoming a matter for wider discussion . 
Indeed , its unreliability is seriously weakening the EU &apos;s fiscal pact - which makes it necessary to open the hood and look inside . 
The aim of the concept of potential - as opposed to actual - GDP is to take into account that , like an engine , an economy often operates below or above potential . 
In a demand-driven recession , actual output falls below potential , which results in a rise in unemployment . 
Similarly , a credit-fueled construction boom drives output above potential , resulting in inflation . 
The gap between actual and potential GDP is thus a gauge of an economy &apos;s spare capacity . 
The distinction is also useful for policy purposes : weak potential growth cannot be addressed by demand-side initiatives ; supply-side measures are needed . 
But potential GDP can be only estimated , not observed . 
Estimates are based on the amount of labor and capital available for production and an assessment of their joint productivity . 
And , because estimates differ , depending on the data and methods used , the concept is clear whereas its value is imprecise . 
Moreover , the global financial crisis has created new puzzles . 
GDP in nearly all advanced economies is currently far below pre-crisis projections , yet few expect the gap ever to be bridged . 
Policymakers struggle to get their assessment right . 
The European Union has an additional problem : in response to the sovereign crisis , most of its members agreed in 2011 to a &quot; fiscal compact &quot; requiring them to keep their structural budget deficit - the one they would record were output equal to potential - below 0.5 % of GDP . 
Failure to converge on this target may open the door to financial penalties . 
The virtue of such a framework is to take into account the impact of temporarily weaker output on fiscal outcomes . 
Thus , a deficit is acceptable when it results from abnormally low tax revenues , but not when revenues are at their normal level . 
Indeed , a major flaw in the initial European Stability and Growth Pact was that it did not include such corrections ( I was among those advocating its reform in a 2003 report to the president of the European Commission ) . 
The 2011 treaty actually built on a series of previous reforms that put increasing emphasis on potential-output-based assessments of the fiscal situation . 
The problem is that an unobservable and imprecise variable - whose estimates are too inexact and volatile to provide more than a rough roadmap for a country &apos;s journey toward fiscal rectitude - has become part of an international treaty and the national rules ( sometimes of constitutional status ) through which it is implemented . 
Estimates of short-term or current potential output are also constantly reworked , implying continuous change in the assessment of the underlying fiscal situation . 
For example , the European Commission &apos;s projection of the Netherlands &quot; potential growth for 2013 was 0.9 % in spring 2012 , when the government started preparing its budget . 
By that autumn , when a real-time assessment of fiscal performance was carried out , it had been revised sharply downward , by 0.2 % . 
For France , the estimate fell from 1.2 % to 0.9 % , and for Italy it went from -0.1 % to -0.4 % . 
The estimate of Spain &apos;s potential growth rate fell from -1.2 % to -1.4 % , but the Commission later changed its mind and now says it was -0.7 % . 
These are not exceptions . 
For actual GDP , such frequent and large forecast revisions are inevitable . 
True , there are reasons to reassess a country &apos;s potential growth in line with new information on labor-market conditions , investment , and productivity . 
But relentless attempts at accuracy easily result in noise . 
Furthermore , instability confuses the policymaking process . 
Even a downward revision by 0.2 % of GDP is meaningful : it implies a deterioration of the structural deficit by about 0.1 % of GDP - not a trivial number in a fiscally constrained environment . 
Members of parliament - who are not technicians - are understandably disturbed when they are asked to pass a revised budget in response to an updated estimate . 
Not knowing the whys and wherefores , they end up perceiving such revisions as a source of artificial instability . 
The purpose of the European fiscal framework is to lengthen the time horizon of policy and to make decision-makers more aware of the debt-sustainability challenges that they face . 
This requires consistency . 
Yet volatility in the assessment of potential growth prevents politicians from &quot; owning &quot; the already abstruse structural deficit and causes volatility in the policies based on this assessment , paradoxically resulting in a shortening of decision-makers &quot; time horizon . 
The focus of policy discussions should not be the latest potential GDP revision , but whether a country is on track to ensure public finance sustainability . 
Too often , the European fiscal pact is perceived by national policymakers as an external constraint , not as a framework conducive to better decisions . 
A greater degree of stability in the assessment of an economy &apos;s potential would strengthen decision-makers &quot; awareness and appreciation of longer-term challenges , thereby putting policymaking on a sounder footing .
