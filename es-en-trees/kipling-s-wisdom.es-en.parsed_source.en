Kipling &apos;s Wisdom 
LONDON - The beginning of October marked the seventh anniversary of the beginning of the American-led bombardment of Afghanistan . 
Seven years later , the Taliban are still fighting . 
Some 50 insurgents died recently in an assault on Lashkar gar , the capital of Helmand province . 
Osama bin Laden is nowhere to be found . 
Has the time come for NATO to declare victory and leave ? 
Recently , a French diplomatic cable relating a conversation on September 2 between the French ambassador to Afghanistan , Francois Fitou , and his British colleague , Sherard Cowper-Coles , was leaked in Le Canard Enchainé , a French satirical magazine . 
Cowper-Coles was reported to have said that the security situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating , that NATO &apos;s presence was making it worse , and that the two American presidential hopefuls should be dissuaded from getting bogged down further . 
The only realistic policy would be to cultivate an &quot; acceptable dictator . &quot; 
Of course , the British Foreign Office denied that these thoughts reflected the British government &apos;s views . 
The departing commander of British forces in Afghanistan , Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith , has claimed that defeating the Taliban was &quot; neither feasible nor supportable . &quot; 
Two days after making that gloomy assessment , the French chief of the defense staff , General Jean-Louis Georgelin , followed suit . 
And Kai Eide , the United Nations Secretary-General &apos;s special representative in Afghanistan , has agreed that the situation cannot be stabilized by military means alone . 
All call for a concerted political effort implying some form of negotiation with the Taliban . 
A draft report by American intelligence agencies has also concluded that Afghanistan is in a &quot; downward spiral &quot; and casts serious doubt on the Afghan government &apos;s ability to stem the Taliban &apos;s resurgence . 
Moreover , King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia hosted a Ramadan breakfast for the Afghan government and Taliban representatives . 
Predictably , both parties deny that any serious negotiations took place , while the United States and Britain claimed to know nothing about this &quot; Saudi initiative . &quot; 
But Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak subsequently said that resolution of the conflict required a &quot; political settlement &quot; with the Taliban . 
Yet at the recent NATO summit in Budapest , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates called on NATO members to provide more troops for missions in Afghanistan . 
He accused the British of being &quot; defeatist &quot; and argued that Afghanistan &apos;s deteriorating security situation could be addressed with an Iraq-style &quot; surge , &quot; which has undoubtedly brought down violence levels in that country . 
The Americans have already committed 8,000 extra troops for next year . 
So there seems to be a split . 
The British and French are busy briefing , and preparing to scale down their commitments in Afghanistan . 
They believe that boosting allied forces will only increase the sense of occupation and give the Taliban more targets . 
The emergence of a &quot; realistic dictator &quot; might allow NATO to withdraw most of its troops within a few years . 
But the Americans want a &quot; surge , &quot; and the US general commanding NATO forces in the country said last month that he needed three more brigades , some 15,000 troops in all , and Gates has asked the Europeans either to send or pay for them . 
The Americans do recognize the importance of courting those Taliban leaders they believe to be motivated by tribal loyalties rather than religious ideology , but they oppose the latest Afghan policy of negotiating directly and officially with the Taliban . 
Both Barack Obama and John McCain advocate increasing troop levels in Afghanistan above the levels that the Bush administration has already pledged . 
Obama has that said he would send troops from Iraq as an urgent priority . 
McCain has given no details of his plans . 
Obama has made it a campaign issue to criticize the Bush administration for neglecting Afghanistan and diverting resources needed there to the misguided war in Iraq . 
McCain , though , has always maintained that Iraq is the more important battlefield . 
What candidates promise on the stump is not always what they do in office . 
In the second presidential debate , Obama said , &quot; We will kill bin Laden . 
We will crush al-Qaeda . &quot; 
Are his patriotic credentials strong enough for him to renege on this pledge and pursue negotiations to withdraw without capturing the talismanic Osama ? 
What would a US withdrawal mean for Afghanistan , for Pakistan , and for the future of NATO ? 
To retreat from its first major &quot; out of area &quot; mission would be a damaging blow for the alliance . 
Curiously , McCain may have more room for maneuver . 
Republican presidents have a better record in negotiating with enemies than do Democratic ones . 
Eisenhower ended the Korean War , Nixon the war in Vietnam - both wars started by their Democrat predecessors . 
Nixon , a vitriolic anti-Communist , opened relations with Mao &apos;s China and started détente with the Soviet Union . 
Reagan brought the US hostages back from Iran . 
Having condemned the &quot; evil empire &quot; of communism , he helped bring the Cold War to an end . Only recently , George W Bush evicted North Korea from his &quot; axis of evil &quot; by removing that country from America &apos;s list of countries that sponsor terrorism . 
And what about the British ? 
Have they suddenly remembered the unsustainable cost of fighting asymmetric conflicts ? 
Afghanistan has never been a place any foreign army could stay for long . 
The British were burned there twice ( 1840-1 , 1878-80 ) . 
So were the Russians . 
Rudyard Kipling got his arithmetic right in 1886 : 
No formulae the text-books know , 
Or ward the tulwar &apos;s downward blow 
Strike hard who cares - shoot straight who can -
