China in the Eye of the Beholder 
CLAREMONT - One of the most glaring , if unremarked , oddities concerning China nowadays is how perceptions of its leaders diverge depending on the observer . 
In the eyes of the Chinese public , government officials are venal , incompetent , and interested solely in getting lucrative appointments . 
It is impossible to reconcile these views . 
Either the Chinese public is impossible to please , or Western executives are hopelessly wrong . 
One obvious explanation is that Chinese officials are extremely good at seducing Western businessmen with friendly gestures and generous promises . 
The same officials who lord it over ordinary Chinese people often summon irresistible charm to woo Western investors . 
Another selling point for Western executives is that many Chinese officials have engineering backgrounds , in contrast to their Western counterparts , most of whom are lawyers . 
To businessmen , engineers are practical problem solvers , whereas lawyers are obsessed with procedural complexities and intent on exploiting contractual loopholes . 
Moreover , most Chinese officials have learned the jargon of Western business , and can speak intelligently about the problems that companies need to solve . 
A more subtle reason for Western executives &quot; perceptions is their subconscious frame of reference when assessing Chinese officials . 
Senior executives of multinational companies tend to have pre-conceived notions of China as just another developing country , and thus evaluate Chinese officials by comparing them with those in other developing countries . 
This unwitting comparison usually comes out in favor of Chinese officials , who are , as a group , better educated , more cosmopolitan , and more focused on business ( because the ruling Communist Party uses economic growth and foreign investment as criteria for promoting officials ) . 
But , while it may be natural for Western businessmen to compare China with other developing countries , Chinese citizens have much higher standards , because they do not regard theirs as just another developing country . 
They view China as special , a re-emerging great power bound to join the ranks of the world &apos;s most advanced countries , and the governance practices that their newspapers cite as models are invariably those of rich societies , not developing ones . 
Indeed , one sure way to insult the Chinese is to tell them they should feel lucky , because they have a better government than the Indians or Brazilians . 
A third reason why Western businessmen get China wrong is that their admiration of the Chinese government is a reflection of their frustrations with their own governments . 
They have grown impatient with the messiness of the democratic process , stifling regulations , high taxes , and media scrutiny . 
Of course , sometimes these executives do miss the rule of law that prevails in the West . 
As a result , they have little direct appreciation of the worst aspect of one-party rule : a rapacious , legally unrestrained elite . 
The most regrettable aspect of Western executives &quot; misconceptions of the Chinese government is that they are likely to persist , at least among those who have no direct experience with the dark side of the Chinese state . 
They are successful , intelligent , and have a high degree of confidence in their political judgment . 
Moreover , Western corporations are hierarchical and autocratic , similar to the Chinese one-party state , so senior executives &quot; errors of judgment are rarely challenged directly by their underlings . 
That is a real pity . 
Few Western executives understand the political consequences of their misperceptions . 
Their praise of Chinese officials &quot; quality and effectiveness is often held up by the Communist Party as an international endorsement of its policies and legitimacy - even if ordinary Chinese know otherwise .
