Europe \ u0027s Bad Lungs 
Respiratory disease is the world &apos;s leading killer , and it is on the rise . 
According to the World Health Organization , of all 50.5 million deaths recorded in 1990 , 9.4 million were due to respiratory diseases . 
By 2020 , of 68 million deaths , 11.9 million will be caused by Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , pneumonia , lung cancer , or tuberculosis . 
Europe performs little better than the rest of the world . 
Respiratory diseases rank second ( after cardiovascular diseases ) in terms of mortality , incidence , prevalence , and costs . 
In some countries , such as the United Kingdom , they are already the leading killer . 
The European White Book on Lung Disease , published in 2003 by the European Respiratory Society and the European Lung Foundation , produced epidemiological data for the full spectrum of lung diseases collected from all European countries for the first time . 
It provides a detailed overview of the evolution of lung diseases in Europe , including data on morbidity , mortality , and costs . 
We have learned a great deal from the White Book . 
For example , lung cancer mortality rates for males fell slightly between 1960 and 1989 in some Western European countries , such as Norway and Switzerland , but are still rising for females in almost all European countries . 
The prevalence of COPD , which is diagnosed mainly in smokers and former smokers , ranges from 2,000 per 100,000 inhabitants to more than 10,000 , with mortality rates varying between 25 and 75 per 100,000 . 
Lung diseases are not just related to smoking . 
Genetic influences , along with nutritional , environmental , and poverty-related factors , play key roles . 
But COPD is predicted to increase as a cause of death , along with lung cancer and TB . 
Whereas TB &apos;s incidence and mortality rates in Western and Central Europe are stable or declining , they have increased in Eastern Europe during the last decade , due to deteriorating health systems . 
Pneumonia will remain an important cause of death in Europe , with incidence currently ranging from 250 to more than 1,000 per 100,000 and mortality from 15 to 45 per 100,000 . 
Asthma has become increasingly prevalent in recent decades , affecting 2-20 % of children in Europe , and between 5 % and 10 % of adults in Western Europe . 
Reported mortality rates vary widely , the highest being more than eight per 100,000 in Portugal . 
Data for other respiratory diseases are scarce . 
The prevalence of sleep-related diseases , for which data are available only from some of the Western European countries , is less than 1,000 per 100,000 inhabitants in France , but more than 5,000 per 100,000 in Sweden . 
Available data on the incidence of cystic fibrosis , the most important hereditary lung disease , indicate a range of between five and ten per 100,000 . 
Where does respiratory disease kill most often ? 
According to the data collected in the White Book , the age-standardized mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants is highest in Kyrgyzstan , at 165 , and lowest in Austria ( 30 ) . 
The European average stands at 65 , while the European Union average is 57 . 
Ireland and the UK suffer some of the highest rates - 120 and 105 , respectively - whereas other Western European and most Central European countries remain below the average . 
As the incidence of lung disease rises , so will its costs . 
The total annual financial burden of respiratory diseases in Europe is currently approximately € 100 billion , with COPD accounting for almost half of the total , followed by asthma , pneumonia , lung cancer , and TB . 
Inpatient care is just the tip of the iceberg , amounting to € 17.8 billion annually . 
Surprisingly , the annual number of hospital days is higher in Western Europe than in Central and Eastern Europe ( 11.1 versus 7.2 per 100,000 population ) , while average daily hospital costs in Western Europe are almost ten times higher ( € 310 versus € 32 ) . 
Other costs include ambulatory care ( € 9.2 billion ) , drug supplies ( € 6.7 billion ) , and mortality and rehabilitation ( € 20 billion ) . 
The largest single cost by far , estimated at € 48.3 billion , is indirect : lost productivity . 
The total number of workdays lost due to respiratory diseases was 66.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in Western Europe - more than four times higher than the rate of 15.4 in Central and Eastern Europe . 
As with hospital stays , so with workdays : higher productivity in Western Europe compounds the cost . 
Because lung diseases are so important , preventive measures , early detection and treatment must be reinforced . 
This will necessitate not only improvements in direct patient care , but also in basic and clinical research as well as in teaching and training . 
Across Europe , there are huge differences in the number of specialists in respiratory medicine , as well as in the number of researchers at the university level . 
The number of chest physicians per 100,000 inhabitants is only 0.8 in the UK , but 10.4 in Greece , with a European average of 3.2 . 
The same is true of respiratory medicine at the university level , where the European average is 0.06 per 100,000 inhabitants , but varies from 0.04 per 100,000 in Poland , Russia , Romania , Austria , Germany , and the UK to more than 0.08 per 100,000 in Norway , Finland , and Ireland . 
Given the scale of their human and economic costs , managing lung diseases should become a high priority for all European countries in the twenty-first century .
