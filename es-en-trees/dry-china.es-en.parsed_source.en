Dry China 
ANSHUN , GUIZHOU PROVINCE , CHINA  -  The Huangguoshu Waterfall in China &apos;s southwestern Guizhou Province is a magnificent sight , when there is water . 
The largest waterfall in Asia , it plunges over a sheer cliff more than 200 feet high in a thundering display of foam , mist , and rainbows . 
Unfortunately , this wonder of nature has recently suffered an indignity . 
Each evening , it gets turned off as if it were a garden fountain . 
This part of China &apos;s southwest , known for its abundant rainfall , mountains , underground rivers and caves , and tropical flora , has recently been gripped by a drought that many say is the worst since the Ming Dynasty . 
So , after all the tourists that irrigate this poor region with precious income leave the viewing platforms below the falls , authorities close the sluice gates that dam the White Water River on the dangerously low upstream reservoir , and the falls cease . 
Then , each morning , before the tourists reappear , they unceremoniously open the gates again , so that the eerily silent falls suddenly revive in a simulacrum of normalcy . 
The disturbance to so elemental a part of this region &apos;s natural architecture is a measure of only one of the many kinds of severe weather aberrations - from floods and droughts to unseasonal blizzards and massive dust storms - that have been unsettling China of late . 
No one can say with any certainty what the causes are . 
To try to compensate for these perturbed weather patterns , Chinese officialdom has launched an unprecedented array of costly projects . 
These include the titanic $ 55 billion South-North Water Transfer Project , a massive engineering effort to construct three canals to bring water from China &apos;s normally wet south to its arid north ; a widespread campaign to dig ever-deeper wells ; a nationwide tree-planting campaign ; and even an extensive effort at &quot; weather modification . &quot; 
According to Zheng Guoguang , the Director of the China Meteorological Administration , &quot; Science and technology will answer the prayers of those living through the harshest drought in decades . &quot; 
He says that two-thirds of China &apos;s almost 3,000 counties have tried artificial methods to induce more rainfall , sometimes resulting in lawsuits over rights to mine passing clouds for water . 
Such efforts , Zheng reports , have involved some 6,533 cannons , 5,939 rocket launchers , and numerous aircraft in an attempt to seed clouds across one-third of China &apos;s landmass with dry ice , ammonia , and silver iodide . 
But can science and technology really solve problems that are not caused by China alone ? 
More and more scientists are beginning to suspect that global warming has caused the radically changed patterns of precipitation now seen across China . 
If true , China will never resolve droughts such as the current one in Guizhou by itself , regardless of how many large-scale engineering projects the government undertakes , or how well organized remedial efforts are . 
After all , global problems demand global solutions . 
When Chairman Mao still reigned supreme , one of his most vaunted principles was zili gengsheng , or &quot; self-reliance . &quot; 
Since China had been bullied , invaded , semi-colonized , and even occupied during most of his formative years , he was deeply suspicious that any foreign country - even a &quot; fraternal &quot; Communist ally - could ever be relied upon to leave China alone , much less actually help it . 
As a result , the Party leadership became steeped in suspicion and distrust toward the outside world , especially toward the so-called &quot; great powers . &quot; 
Even today , with Mao &apos;s revolution long gone and globalization having knit a new fabric of inter-dependence around China , there remains , particularly among older leaders , a residual wariness about relying on collaboration with outsiders , especially when it comes to &quot; core interests . &quot; 
But it is not just world markets that have enmeshed China in a new commons . 
Issues such as nuclear proliferation and the global environment - and especially climate change - have also snuck up on China &apos;s leaders ( and everyone else ) . 
Like it or not , leaders everywhere are now enfolded in an inescapable web . 
So , despite China &apos;s predilection for aloofness , cooperation is not merely an option , but a necessity . 
This is a difficult adjustment for any country to make , especially one like China , which has a history of imagining itself as being at the center of the world while also remaining an inviolable entity that can close its doors whenever it chooses to do so . 
That time is past . 
China &apos;s leaders have been committed to a process of &quot; opening &quot; for more than a generation . 
The drought in Guizhou , whatever its cause , is a reminder that the fate of China &apos;s people has become inextricably linked to what happens elsewhere , and that no country can opt out or find unilateral solutions separate from the global commonweal any longer .
