Europe &apos;s Fitful Financial Integration 
LONDON - The well-publicized troubles of Portugal &apos;s Banco Espírito Santo this summer have reminded us that the eurozone &apos;s financial problems are by no means resolved . 
There are , no doubt , idiosyncratic factors behind the bank &apos;s problems , stemming from its exposure to other parts of the Espírito Santo family &apos;s empire . 
But when the bank announced a first-half loss of € 3.6 billion ( $ 4.7 billion ) , the sudden collapse of confidence was alarming , and nervous investors are asking whether there are similar time bombs ticking elsewhere . 
All eyes are now on the European Central Bank &apos;s asset quality review , due to be completed in the next couple of months . 
The AQR is the key element in a &quot; comprehensive assessment &quot; of Europe &apos;s banks before the ECB formally takes on supervisory responsibility for more than 80 % of the eurozone banking system in November . 
The ECB , quite sensibly , wants all of the potential horrors to be visible before the takeover - so that it cannot be blamed . 
With national supervisors , who are often inclined to present a rosy picture of their countries &quot; institutions , no longer in charge , we can hope that the assessment will be more robust than the earlier stress tests carried out under the auspices of the European Banking Authority ( EBA ) . 
Those tests , unlike their equivalent in the United States , failed to rebuild confidence . 
Several banks that passed with flying colors were soon obliged to raise new capital . 
But the creation of the European banking union has not been the only important change to Europe &apos;s financial regulation since the crisis . 
The events of 2007-2009 made it clear that there were serious gaps and inconsistencies that needed to be addressed . 
So , following the recommendations of a report prepared in 2009 by former IMF Managing Director Jacques de Larosière , the European Commission created three new pan-European authorities charged with ensuring &quot; consistent application &quot; of European directives . 
The deal was done with a large helping of political fudge : the three biggest European Union economies - the United Kingdom , France , and Germany - were persuaded to cede some control to the center , but only if each could host an authority . 
Thus , the EBA was established in London , the European Securities and Markets Authority ( ESMA ) is located in Paris , and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority ( EIOPA ) found a home in Frankfurt . 
Collectively , they are known as the ESAs ( European supervisory authorities ) . 
The road to pan-European regulation over the last two decades has been winding and rocky . 
In the early stages , it was assumed that the single financial market could work on the basis of mutual recognition : each country would accept the others &quot; regulation as broadly equivalent to its own and allow cross-border business to proceed on that basis . 
That proved inadequate , as standards and rules remained very different from country to country , and gave way to an approach based on minimum harmonization , whereby core rules were to be the same across Europe , but local variations and additions remained permissible . 
When that , too , proved ineffective at promoting competition , as countries used their national rules to block new entrants , the emphasis switched to maximum harmonization , with directives spelling out exactly how local rules must be applied across the EU . 
That caused great concern in the City of London , but has been grudgingly accepted . 
Since the global financial crisis , London has become less able to argue that it is special and must be left alone . 
Now , with the establishment of central regulatory authorities , the EU has moved to the next stage of financial integration . 
But , so far , these agencies &quot; responsibilities are very limited . 
ESMA supervises rating agencies directly ; but , outside banking , national authorities retain their day-to-day oversight responsibilities . 
Integration-minded officials at the European Commission clearly do not regard this as a satisfactory end-state . 
So they commissioned a thoughtful review of the three ESAs from Mazars , an accounting firm , which was published earlier this year . 
The verdict , roughly , was &quot; so far , so good . &quot; 
Now the Commission has followed up by publishing its own assessment . 
The Commission was perhaps unlikely to be hypercritical of its own creations , and it is not . 
Its report maintains that the ESAs have &quot; quickly established well-functioning organizations aimed at contributing to restoring confidence in the financial sector , &quot; and that market participants seem broadly satisfied with their work . 
But the report &apos;s authors believe that there is a need to expand the current mandates , develop a comprehensive approach to consumer protection , and reduce further the influence of national authorities . 
The ESAs should have more power to impose their will in the interests of the EU as a whole . 
Their chairs should have wider discretion to act on their own initiative . 
The ESAs also need more money , which probably can come from fees levied on financial firms , and consideration should be given to merging them in a single location , presumably Brussels . 
The general direction is clear . 
Unless the new internal market commissioner takes a different view , the European Commission plans to move further along the road to genuine pan-European regulation . 
The report now goes to the European Parliament , which can be expected to push harder for more integration , as it usually does . 
A single authority , or perhaps two or three working closely together , is a logical arrangement for the eurozone , and perhaps for the entire EU financial market . 
It would usefully complement the ECB &apos;s new supervisory role . 
But will London fall into line this time ? 
The British government , after all , has embarked on a path that runs in precisely the opposite direction - reducing the functions of central bodies and repatriating powers to national capitals . 
Given the central role of London in EU financial markets , and its political sensitivity in the UK , there is bound to be trouble ahead .
