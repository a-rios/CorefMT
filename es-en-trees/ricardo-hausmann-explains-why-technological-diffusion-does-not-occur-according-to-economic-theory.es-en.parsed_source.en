The Mismeasure of Technology 
CAMBRIDGE - There is nothing better than fuzzy language to wreak havoc - or facilitate consensus . 
Ludwig Wittgenstein argued that philosophical puzzles are really just a consequence of the misuse of language . 
By contrast , the art of diplomacy is to find language that can hide disagreement . 
One idea about which economists agree almost unanimously is that , beyond mineral wealth , the bulk of the huge income difference between rich and poor countries is attributable to neither capital nor education , but rather to &quot; technology . &quot; 
So what is technology ? 
The answer explains the unusual consensus among economists , for &quot; technology &quot; is measured as a kind of &quot; none of the above &quot; category , a residual - Nobel laureate Robert Solow called it &quot; total factor productivity &quot; - that remains unexplained after accounting for other production inputs , such as physical and human capital . 
As Moses Abramovitz aptly noted in 1956 , this residual is not much more than &quot; a measure of our ignorance . &quot; 
So , while agreeing that technology underpins the wealth of nations sounds more meaningful than confessing our ignorance , it really is not . 
And it is our ignorance that we need to address . 
In an important book , W. Brian Arthur defines technology as a collection of devices and engineering practices available to a culture . 
But devices can be put in a container and shipped around the world , while recipes , blueprints , and how-to manuals can be posted online , putting them just a few clicks away . 
In fact , much of modern growth theory , starting with Paul Romer &apos;s research in the late 1980 &quot; s , sprang from the idea that output was driven higher by ideas that are hard to come by but easy to copy . 
That is why inventors have to be protected by patents and copyrights or subsidized by governments . 
So , if ideas are easy to copy and devices are easy to ship , why do differences in &quot; technology &quot; persist between countries ? 
When something upsets a beneficent natural order , humans crave for stories featuring some malign force . 
For example , the argument in Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson &apos;s book Why Nations Fail is essentially that technology does not diffuse because the ruling elite does not want it to . 
They impose extractive ( bad ) institutions , instead of adopting inclusive ( good ) institutions ; and , because technology may upset their control over society , they choose to do without it . 
As a Venezuelan who is seeing his country collapse at this very moment , I do not doubt that there have been many instances in human history during which those in power have prevented progress . 
But I am also struck by how often governments that embrace the goal of shared growth - post-apartheid South Africa is a good example - fail to achieve it . 
Such governments promote schooling , free trade , property rights , social programs , and the Internet , and yet their countries &quot; economies remain stuck . 
If technology is just devices and ideas , what is holding them back ? 
The problem is that a key component of technology is knowhow , which is an ability to perform a task . 
And knowhow , unlike devices and ideas , neither involves nor can be acquired through comprehension . 
The tennis champion Rafael Nadal does not really know what it is that he does when he successfully returns a serve . 
He just knows how to do it ; putting it in words is impossible , and any effort to do so would not make the rest of us better players . 
As the scientist and philosopher Michael Polanyi would say of such tacit knowledge , we know more than we can tell . 
So we do not need extractive elites or other evil forces to explain why technology does not diffuse . 
Technology has trouble diffusing because much of it requires knowhow , which is an ability to recognize patterns and respond with effective actions . 
It is a wiring in the brain that may require years of practice to achieve . 
This makes its diffusion very slow : As I have argued previously , knowhow moves to new areas when the brains that hold it move there . 
Once there , they can train others . 
Moreover , now that knowhow is becoming increasingly collective , not individual , diffusion is becoming even slower . 
Collective knowhow refers to the ability to perform tasks that cannot be carried out by an individual , like playing a symphony or delivering the mail : neither a violinist nor a letter carrier can do it alone . 
Likewise , a society cannot simply imitate the idea of Amazon or eBay unless many of its citizens already have access to the Internet , credit cards , and delivery services . 
In other words , new technologies require the previous diffusion of other technologies . 
That is why cities , regions , and countries can absorb technology only gradually , generating growth through some recombination of the knowhow that is already in place , maybe with the addition of some component - a bassist to complete a string quartet . 
But they cannot move from a quartet to a philharmonic orchestra in one fell swoop , because it would require too many missing instruments - and , more important , too many musicians who know how to play them . 
Progress happens by moving into what the theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman calls the &quot; adjacent possible , &quot; which implies that the best way to find out what is likely to be feasible in a country is to consider what is already there . 
Politics may indeed impede technological diffusion ; but , to a large extent , technology does not diffuse because of the nature of technology itself .
