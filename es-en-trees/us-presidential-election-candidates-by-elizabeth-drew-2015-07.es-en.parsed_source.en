America &apos;s Why Not Election 
WASHINGTON , DC - Those having trouble making sense of the American presidential election campaign need not worry . 
It doesn &apos;t make sense . 
The 2016 race is shaping up as the weirdest in modern times , owing not just to the number of candidates - currently 14 , with two or three more expected to announce soon - but also to the unusual nature of many of them . 
The usual question posed about presidential aspirants is : Why is he running ? 
This year , the answer seems to be : Why not ? 
As long as one is not too attached to one &apos;s dignity , there is little to lose and a lot to be gained from running . 
A failed presidential campaign , even a disastrous one , can lead to higher speaking fees , richer book contracts , or a television gig . 
Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee both failed to win the Republican nomination , but secured seats on cable talk shows . 
On the Democratic side , the question asked in political circles these days is not whether Hillary Clinton can win the nomination , but whether she can lose it . 
The answer is yes - in the sense that anything is possible . 
Nobody I know thinks she is likely to stumble so badly ; still , the Clintons are known to be accident-prone , and they have been full of surprises - scandals and scandalettes - since they first appeared on the national scene a quarter-century ago . 
This is why many Democrats back her without enthusiasm . 
Bernie Sanders , a self-described socialist , inspires enthusiasm . 
Sanders is riding the leftist wave in Democratic politics , and while many of his proposals may not be able to stand up against hard questioning ( how , for example , would he fund his plan to make college tuition free for everyone ? ) , he has so far managed to avoid any serious challenge to them . 
Sanders &apos;s main advantage is that he comes off as authentic - a candidate , who , like the billionaire businessman Ross Perot in 1992 , &quot; tells it like it is &quot; - while Clinton very much does not . 
She seems packaged and cautious , slow to get around to a position on some key issues , such as trade , that divide Democrats . 
For the moment , however , nobody can predict whether Sanders will be able to convert the impressive crowds he has been drawing into electoral strength , or even how long he will remain in fashion . 
The latest entry into the Democratic race , Jim Webb - who has served as Assistant Secretary of Defense , Secretary of the Navy , and Senator from Virginia - has talent , but lacks steadiness . 
Martin O &apos;Malley , the former governor of Maryland , has promise , but has yet to catch on . 
And Lincoln Chaffee , a former governor of Rhode Island , is an ethereal mystery . 
None is likely to make more than a fleeting impact , if that . 
Clinton has fame , money , and organization - advantages that only she ( or perhaps her husband ) can throw away . 
The Republican race , by contrast , remains wide open . 
At the beginning of the year , the conventional wisdom was that if Jeb Bush threw his hat into the ring , he would be the odds-on favorite . 
He looked like a shoo-in on paper , but candidates don &apos;t run on paper . 
Will he prove nimble enough to maneuver through the Republican nominating process , given that its early stages are heavily tilted to the right ? 
Evangelical Christians play a crucial role in the Iowa caucuses , the first contest in the quest for the nomination , but putting too much effort into pleasing them can make a candidate unelectable . 
Bush shows signs of skipping Iowa , but then he would &quot; have to &quot; win New Hampshire . 
Bush &apos;s interest in running was enough to convince Mitt Romney , who lost the 2012 election to Barack Obama , not to try a third time . 
Ambitious young pols like Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker currently are viewed as Bush &apos;s strongest rivals , but both will be facing increased scrutiny and testing . 
Rand Paul enjoyed a period of buzz , but that seems to have faded , as his dovish brand of libertarianism clashes with a party that leans toward social conservatism and interventionism abroad . 
I seem to have been one of the few journalists who from the outset didn &apos;t think that Donald Trump &apos;s entry into the presidential race was funny . 
Trump is not remotely qualified to be president , but he is no joke . 
Trump &apos;s offensive comments about immigrants from Mexico - &quot; They &apos;re bringing drugs . 
They &apos;re bringing crime . They &apos;re rapists . 
And some , I assume , are good people . &quot; - sent his popularity soaring , to the mortification of many Republican leaders . 
Those leaders have good reason to be panicked by Trump &apos;s rise : They know that if they can &apos;t find a way to attract more Hispanic voters than Romney did in 2012 , they will have a poor chance of winning the presidency . 
Trump &apos;s comments may have cost him some of his commercial ties , but anyone who thinks he doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s doing should think again . 
No one knows right now whether Trump will flame out or prove to have staying power , but one thing is clear : he is not the only one injecting strangeness into the nomination contest . 
One of the more bizarre aspects of this election is the success of Ben Carson , a retired neurosurgeon and political neophyte . 
His extreme views on homosexuality - he has likened it to bestiality and claimed that spending time in prison makes people gay - has resonated with a swath of the Republican electorate , making him a real contender in Iowa . 
The 2016 presidential election campaign not only has more candidates than ever ; it also has the highest proportion in memory who are flat-out unqualified for the job . 
Many observers will remain mystified ; few will be bored .
