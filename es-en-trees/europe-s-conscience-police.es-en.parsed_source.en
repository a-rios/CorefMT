Europe &apos;s Conscience Police 
The story of the rejection last autumn of my appointment to be a member of the European Commission is notorious . 
Nominated to the Commission by the Italian Government , I was compelled to withdraw because of some allegedly homophobic remarks I was said to have made before the European Parliament &apos;s Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice , and Home Affairs . 
Now that the dust from that dispute has settled , and with a new Commission in place , it is time to ask what lessons can be drawn from this affair . 
The first lesson concerns the indispensability in politics of accurate information and reporting . 
Of course , everyone is free to comment on and evaluate events as he or she pleases . 
But a high standard of fidelity to the truth is needed in the media ; otherwise , debates become too distorted for citizens to evaluate correctly their meaning . 
Reporters are not entitled to so twist the facts as to reinvent them . 
In my case , the main charge against me was invented : I made no homophobic statement . 
Nor did I did introduce the issue of homosexuality into the debate over my appointment . 
My opponents did . 
I did not introduce the emotionally charged word &quot; sin &quot; and tie it to homosexuality in the debate . 
Once again , my foes did this . 
What I said , instead , was this : I might , as a practicing Roman Catholic who adheres to his Church &apos;s teachings , think that homosexuality is a sin . 
This belief could not be construed to have any influence on my decisions , unless I also said and believed that homosexuality is also a crime . 
But I said nothing of the sort . 
A liberal society is a society in which people holding different moral opinions are bound together through a common rule of law . 
In the fields of both law and politics , I have consistently and clearly supported the principle of non-discrimination . 
The distinction that I was drawing in my testimony , between law and morals , was not accepted . 
Worse , it was turned into a caricature , and then declared false . 
Indeed , the committee entered in the sphere of moral conscience by stating that anyone who does not adhere to a positive moral evaluation of homosexuality is unfit to serve as a European commissioner . 
This means that anyone holding to the moral doctrines of most Christian churches should nowadays be considered a second-class citizen in the European Union . 
According to this principle , Konrad Adenauer , Robert Schuman , and Alcide de Gasperi - three of the EU &apos;s founding fathers - would not measure up . 
What is wrong with the fact that a parliamentary committee passes a political judgment against a Commissioner for purely political reasons ? 
The rejection of my nomination was , according to many , just another political battle : you win some , you lose some , but you cannot say that you have been unfairly discriminated against simply because you lost . 
But the European Commission is not accountable to the European Parliament in the same way that a national government is accountable to its parliament . 
The EU &apos;s member governments name the members of the European Commission , and the Parliament lacks an explicit right to veto them . 
A hearing over a nomination to be a Commissioner before an EU parliamentary committee should simply examine whether the person is competent in the area he or she is to oversee on the Commission , and whether there are elements of moral indignity - i.e. , such obvious moral failings as to be disqualifying . 
Now it seems that , according to the committee that rejected my nomination , adhering to the principles of most Christian churches is a cause for such a &quot; moral &quot; disqualification . 
The implication of this position is profound and shocking . 
If it were generally accepted , it would imply that the EU now holds official moral doctrines , and that allegiance to these doctrines is required in order to exercise the full right of citizens to serve in a public capacity . 
That implication is intolerable , and it will progressively weaken and divide the EU through a type of semi-official hostility to religious faith . 
Moreover , the demand for such an allegiance is a renunciation of one of the most important steps in Europe &apos;s development . 
It has been roughly 300 years since religious people came to understand that being of a different faith , or being agnostic , did not disqualify one from public office . 
If the moral test that I endured stands , it means that Europe has come full circle : agnostics are no longer willing to accept that being religious - and having different moral views - should not bar someone from holding an official post . 
I hope that the European Parliament &apos;s Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice , and Home Affairs will reconsider its behavior , and that the &quot; Buttiglione affair &quot; will remain only an ordinary political injustice against a single individual rather than the harbinger of second-class citizenship for religious believers . 
If , on the other hand , the European Parliament &apos;s members follow through on the logic of my case - if my shunning becomes the basis for a consistent policy - the EU will be on its way to creating a kind of morality police and launching a modern-day inquisition , one that crassly violates both freedom of religion and freedom of conscience .
