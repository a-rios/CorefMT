A Time for Action in the Middle East 
LONDON - The announcement , following the use of chemical weapons in Syria , of an emergency summit in Jordan this week of military leaders from the United States , the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Italy , Canada , Turkey , Saudi Arabia , and Qatar is a welcome development . 
Western policy is at a crossroads : commentary or action ; shaping events or reacting to them . 
After the long and painful campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan , I understand every impulse to stay clear of the turmoil , to watch but not to intervene , to ratchet up language but not to engage in the hard , even harsh business of changing reality on the ground . 
But we have to understand the consequences of wringing our hands instead of putting them to work . 
People wince at the thought of intervention . 
But contemplate the future consequences of inaction and shudder : Syria , mired in the carnage between the brutality of Bashar al-Assad and various affiliates of Al Qaeda , a breeding ground of extremism infinitely more dangerous than Afghanistan in the 1990 &quot; s ; 
Egypt in chaos , with the West , however unfairly , looking as if it is giving succor to those who would turn it into a Sunni version of Iran ; and Iran itself , despite its new president , still a theocratic dictatorship , with a nuclear bomb . 
The West would appear confused , its allies would be dismayed , and its enemies would be emboldened . 
This is a nightmare scenario , but it is not far-fetched . 
Start with Egypt . 
To many in the West , it is clear that the Egyptian military has removed a democratically elected government and is now repressing a legitimate political party , killing its supporters and imprisoning its leaders . 
So we are on a steady track toward ostracizing the new government . 
In doing so , we think that we are upholding our values . 
I completely understand this view . 
But to embrace it would be a grave strategic error . 
The fallacy of this approach lies in the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s nature . 
We think of it as a normal political party . 
It is not . 
If you want to join the UK Conservative Party or the German Christian Democrats or America &apos;s Democratic Party , you can do so easily , and they will welcome you with open arms . 
In all of these countries , all parties respect basic democratic freedoms . 
The Muslim Brotherhood is not such a party . 
Becoming a member is a seven-year process of induction and indoctrination . 
The Brotherhood is a movement run by a hierarchy that is more akin to the Bolsheviks . 
Read their speeches - those put out not for Western ears , but for their own . 
What they were doing in Egypt was not &quot; governing badly . &quot; 
If you elect a bad government , then tough - you live with it . 
The Muslim Brotherhood , by contrast , was systematically changing the constitution and taking control of the commanding heights of the state in order to make it impossible for its rule to be challenged . 
And it was doing so in pursuit of values that contradict everything for which democracy stands . 
So you can rightly criticize the actions or overreactions of Egypt &apos;s new military government ; but it is difficult to criticize the intervention that brought it into being . 
Now all of the choices that Egypt faces are ugly . 
There are large numbers of soldiers and police among the casualties , as well as civilians ; and , partly as a byproduct of the fall of Libya &apos;s Muammar el-Qaddafi , Egypt is awash with weapons . 
But simply condemning the military will not bring a return to democracy any nearer . 
Egypt is not a creation of nineteenth- or twentieth-century global power games . 
It is an ancient civilization stretching back thousands of years , imbued with fierce national pride . 
The army has a special place in its society . 
The people do want democracy , but they will be disdainful of Western critics whom they will see as utterly naive in the face of the threat to democracy that the Muslim Brotherhood posed . 
We should support the new government in stabilizing the country ; urge everyone , including the Muslim Brotherhood , to get off the streets ; and let a proper and short process to an election with independent observers be put in place . 
A new constitution that protects minority rights and the basic ethos of the country should be drafted , and all political parties should operate according to rules that ensure transparency and commitment to the democratic process . 
This is the only realistic way to help those - probably a majority - who want genuine democracy , not an election used as a route to domination . 
In Syria , we know what is happening - and that it is wrong to let it happen . 
But leave aside any moral argument and just think of the world &apos;s interests for a moment . 
Doing nothing would mean Syria &apos;s disintegration , divided in blood , with the countries around it destabilized and waves of terrorism rolling over the region . 
Assad would remain in power in the richest part of the country , with bitter sectarian fury reigning in the country &apos;s eastern hinterland . 
Iran , with Russia &apos;s support , would be ascendant - and the West apparently impotent . 
I hear people talk as if nothing can be done : the Syrian defense systems are too powerful , the issues too complex , and in any event , why take sides when one is as bad as the next ? 
But others are taking sides . 
They are not terrified of the prospect of intervention . 
They are intervening in support of a regime that is assaulting civilians in ways not seen since the dark days of Saddam Hussein . 
It is time we took a side : the side of the people who want what we want ; who see our societies , for all their faults , as something to admire ; who know that they should not be faced with a choice between tyranny and theocracy . 
I detest the implicit notion behind so much of our commentary that the Arabs or , even worse , the people of Islam , are unable to understand what a free society looks like , that they cannot be trusted with something so modern as a polity where religion is in its proper place . 
It is not true . 
What is true is that there is a life-and-death struggle going on over the future of Islam , with extremists aiming to subvert both its open-minded tradition and the modern world . 
In this struggle , we should not be neutral . 
Wherever this extremism is destroying the lives of innocent people - from Iran to Syria , Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia , as well as elsewhere in Africa , Central Asia , and the Far East - we should be at their side . 
As one of the architects of policy after the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 , I know the controversy , anguish , and cost of the decisions taken . 
I understand why the pendulum has swung so heavily the other way . 
But it is not necessary to revert to that policy to make a difference . 
And the forces that made intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq so difficult are of course the very forces at the heart of the storm today . 
They have to be defeated . 
We should defeat them , however long it takes , because otherwise they will not disappear . 
They will grow stronger , until we will reach another crossroads ; at that point , there will be no choice .
