Globalizing European Security 
MADRID - Global security - a safe and peaceful environment free of conflict - is a public good . 
In other words , all of the world &apos;s citizens and countries benefit from it , regardless of whether they contribute to supplying it . 
Given this , free riders ( those who enjoy the benefits of the good without investing in its provision ) are likely to be plentiful . 
But , when it comes to global stability , the world simply cannot afford a free-riding Europe . 
To be sure , given Europe &apos;s violent past , the European Union &apos;s greatest contribution to international security has been to ensure stability in its own region . 
Today , nearly a century after the outbreak of World War I , peace and stability are firmly entrenched in Europe . 
Other regions , however , are volatile and unstable . 
For example , strategic tinderboxes like the Middle East and Southeast Asia lack the regional security structures with which Europe is endowed . 
The Middle East &apos;s geographic proximity means that Europe cannot ignore it , while it would be folly to ignore Southeast Asia &apos;s economic weight . 
The EU is the world &apos;s largest economy , with annual GDP of more than â‚¬ 15.5 trillion ( $ 21.3 trillion ) , and its greatest trading power , accounting for 20 % of world trade . 
Clearly , the EU should aspire to increase its contribution to global security beyond maintaining peace among its member states . 
This is no time for Europe to rest on its laurels - particularly with the United States moving to extract itself from two wars and confronting isolationist urges . 
Enter this month &apos;s European Council meeting : on December 19-20 , heads of state and government from the EU &apos;s 28 member countries will convene to discuss the Common Security and Defense Policy ( CSDP ) . 
Throughout the discussions , a forward-looking , ambitious vision must be maintained in order to bring a truly global European security strategy into view . 
Unfortunately , in national governments and EU institutions alike , the leadership needed to realize this strategic vision is lacking . 
The summit will face several hurdles from the outset . 
For starters , the ongoing consequences of simultaneous economic , political , and institutional crises continue to determine the European agenda . 
Realizing a long-term vision is more difficult than ever when so many short-term imperatives - reviving growth and employment , winning elections , and re-engaging a distrustful public amid growing populist sentiment , to name just a few - materialize simultaneously . 
In this environment , deepening Europe &apos;s defense and security integration would appear to be low on the list of priorities . 
But the opposite is true : further development of the CSDP is essential to the survival of the European way of life . 
This month &apos;s Council will lay the foundations for the CSDP &apos;s further development by addressing three main topics : operational efficiency , defense capabilities , and the state of the European defense industry . 
If the EU &apos;s defense and security policy is to be strong , global , and effective , it is imperative to take advantage of both the specialization and pooling of member states &quot; technology and resources . 
As national budgets shrink under the effects of austerity , the EU should review member states &quot; spending on security . 
It is senseless for each national government to invest limited resources identically . 
This moment holds potential : spending cuts could be transformed into an opportunity to coordinate and integrate Europe &apos;s defense industry , thus maximizing overall efficiency . 
The objective must be to boost European security integration ( in its broadest sense ) , lifting Europe to the forefront of global security . 
As member states advance along this path , propelled forward by technological and operational excellence and innovation , they will find avenues to eliminate unnecessary spending and optimize resource use . 
Europe &apos;s defense industry will not be able to make progress without a well-functioning market - open , transparent , and with equal opportunities for all European suppliers . 
Advances in the defense industry lead to significant positive externalities , such as civil-military synergies and investment in research and development , which is fundamental to growth , innovation , and future competitiveness . 
A critical component in the coordination and proper functioning of Europe &apos;s security and defense policy is the European Defense Agency . 
At the upcoming summit , leaders should reiterate the importance of the EDA , whose budget has remained frozen at the insistence of certain member states . 
It would be irresponsible to treat December &apos;s Council meeting as just another summit . 
Europe and an increasingly unstable world need a viable framework for global security . 
A fully developed CSDP - itself the cornerstone of further European integration - must be a fundamental component of such a system .
