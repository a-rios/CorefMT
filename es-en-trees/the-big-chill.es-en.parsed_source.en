The Big Chill 
MOSCOW : Russian-American relations are witnessing a renewed process of deterioration . 
The Republicans were then presenting the Democrats as the party who &quot; lost &quot; Russia , so it was not to the Clinton / Gore Administration &apos;s advantage to second this by themselves feuding with the Putin administration . 
Now , with Republicans in the White House , the problems between the two countries are out in the open and multiplying . 
The Bush Administration appears to believe that Russia and America are playing a &quot; zero sum &quot; game : that every diplomatic triumph Russia may have , no matter how minor , comes at American expense . 
Thus Russian efforts to treat the diplomatic world as a multi-polar one is viewed in Washington only as a facade for its efforts to diminish America . 
Making matters worse , the two countries have , to all intents and purposes , broken off both unofficial and - with scarcely an exception - official dialogue . 
Why is this happening ? 
Much of American foreign policy is now in the hands of people who have been out of international diplomacy for fifteen to twenty years , and so continue to sing from the old Cold War hymn book . 
Holding pride of place here is America &apos;s Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld , and a number of people around him . 
They appear unable to recognize that the post-Cold War world is not the world they knew when last in power . 
Before negotiating with their old adversaries , the Russians , they seem determined to show just how tough they are . 
But neither America nor Russia - Russia to an even greater extent - benefit from confrontation . 
Confrontation , indeed , will only lead to a situation in which Russia will be driven into a corner and ally itself with states truly hostile to the US , even though Russia is not now hostile towards America . 
It is important to recognize that today &apos;s international situation and strategic stability are more fragile than during the Cold War years of predictable superpower rivalry . 
It is because of the unpredictable nature of today &apos;s world that neither side can afford a farcical &quot; Cold War , The Sequel . &quot; 
The Cold War was a tragedy ; a repeat can only be a farce because it is unnecessary . 
So it is essential that the Bush and Putin administrations begin wide-ranging dialogues - at both the unofficial and official levels - in order to take their relations out of their semi-nose-dive . 
Sources of friction , however , are not solely on America &apos;s side . 
In Russia , too , a feeling has built up that America can and must be held responsible for the many troubles that Russians have , in fact , brought upon themselves . 
Someone , it seems , must be blamed for the pain of the last decade , and it is easier to blame Americans than to blame ourselves . 
An element of wishful thinking has also entered some Russian strategic thinking . 
One such element is that Europe will interpose itself between America and Russia over the Bush plan for National Missile Defense ( NMD ) . 
Europe , however , will not mediate over NMD ; indeed , Europe is backpedaling from its earlier opposition to the scheme . 
This is why the calculations that some Russian strategists make - ie , that Russia will be able to forge a sort of all-European-coalition against America over NMD - are patently ridiculous . 
Over NMD , Europe &apos;s vital interests are engaged to such a slight degree that it will never quarrel seriously with the US on this count , even though most European leaders do not like America &apos;s policy . 
Another , related issue that holds the potential for real danger concerns proposed revision of the Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty . 
Formal negotiations here , however , will only lead to a toughening of America &apos;s position , boosting the cause of NMD &apos;s advocates . 
Russia &apos;s position is also likely to harden as well . 
Here the result can only be that Russia will be forced to cave in disgracefully , because we lack sufficient strength to hold our ground and dare not irresponsibly escalate the matter into a global crisis . 
To lose out in this way , however , will only repeat the tragedy of the Russia / NATO Founding Act when , by signing and ratifying that treaty , Russia legitimized NATO &apos;s eastward expansion . 
As no benefit can be gained by Russia from either surrendering or holding tough on this issue , the best thing for us is to evade negotiations on it altogether and , instead , initiate a wide-ranging dialogue on preserving and strengthening global strategic stability . 
This dialogue should go beyond nuclear weapons to include the fight against terrorism , non-proliferation , the global arms trade , and Asia &apos;s evolving role in global security . 
Under no circumstances , however , should the ABM issue be included , for it will only aggravate Russian / American relations . 
As for the expulsion of 50 Russian diplomats from America recently , this , of course , it is too much , although the British used to expel upwards of 100 . 
Once these tit-for-tat expulsions are over , both governments should seriously assess each other as they really are , not as they wish or fear each other to be .
