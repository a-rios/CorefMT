Ebola in America 
NEW YORK - Until Thomas Eric Duncan brought Ebola into the United States , the disease was largely dismissed as an exotic pestilence of concern mainly to impoverished West Africa , and those who dared to volunteer there . 
And its transmission to two nurses responsible for Duncan &apos;s care - likely resulting from several breaches of medical protocol - has focused intense scrutiny on US preparedness for a possible outbreak . 
President Barack Obama even announced last week the appointment of an &quot; Ebola Czar &quot; to manage the detection , isolation , and control of the virus in the US . 
Medical and public health experts had been assuring the public that there was little cause for fear . 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and other health agencies were working behind the scenes , painstakingly tracing anyone who may have come into contact with Duncan and quarantining those who might transmit the disease . 
Transmission in the US was nearly impossible , owing to the strength of the US health system , it was thought . 
But , as recent events have illustrated , robust health agencies should not be taken for granted . 
In fact , over the past decade , the government has slashed budgets at several top health agencies , including the CDC , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , and state and local health departments . 
Between 2005 and 2012 , for example , the CDC lost 17 % of its funding , and officials recently reported that funding allocated for Ebola-type health emergencies is $ 1 billion less than it was in 2003 . 
The challenges faced at the state and local levels may be even greater . 
Some 23 % of local health departments reported that public health preparedness programs were reduced or even eliminated in 2011 , while a further 15 % reported similar cuts in 2012 . 
In 2014 alone , the Hospital Preparedness Program , which links regional hospitals with local health departments to prepare for potential public health emergencies , suffered $ 100 million in budget cuts . 
These reductions have already left their mark . 
The Hospital Preparedness Program was designed specifically to train health personnel on disease containment in the setting of unforeseen epidemics , such as Ebola . 
Had it been adequately funded , perhaps the two nurses now infected would still be healthy . 
The NIH , which funds important advances in our understanding and treatment of diseases like Ebola , has also suffered cutbacks . 
Its budget has stagnated for most of the past decade , except for years when it was dramatically reduced , such as in 2013 . 
This has forced productive research laboratories to close , putting potentially life-saving research - like that on an Ebola vaccine - on the back burner . 
One explanation for the drastic budget cuts of recent years is that public health institutions usually operate with little fanfare and out of the public eye . 
At their best , they prevent disease without a trace , leaving little visible evidence of their crucial function . 
Hence , funding for public health has been a tough sell in good economic times , and is one of the first targets for retrenchment . 
But global health emergencies like the current Ebola epidemic highlight the folly of these fiscal priorities . 
Though we may not lean too heavily on our health infrastructure typically , its importance becomes all too apparent when disease and death come knocking at our door . 
Indeed , though the threat of a serious Ebola outbreak in the US remains minimal , that is no reason for complacency . 
As the number of cases in West Africa rises , so does the potential for outbreaks outside of that context . 
And when members of the international community cannot contain the epidemic , the richest and most powerful actor , namely the US , has an obligation to step in and try to do so . 
But budget cuts have damaged America &apos;s ability to fulfill this obligation , and thus may cost more than policymakers bargained for . 
In late September , Obama committed $ 88 million and 3,000 troops to support the fight against Ebola in Liberia . 
But his decision came only after the epidemic had been smoldering for many months , with 6,000 Ebola cases confirmed and many more believed to be undetected . 
Had CDC funding been at an appropriate level , US support - in the form of highly trained public health professionals , rather than ground troops - might have been deployed much earlier and been more effective . 
Ironically , the CDC and its leadership have come under intense scrutiny over the mishandling of Duncan &apos;s care and the Ebola transmissions that resulted from it . 
However , had the same lawmakers who are now deriding the CDC listened to pleas for more support and warnings of the consequences of poor funding over the past several years , perhaps the US would not be in the situation in which it finds itself today . 
The guiding principle of public health is to prevent disease before it strikes , and this requires long-term investment in institutions that can protect us . 
Our collective health and wellbeing are evidence of such institutions &quot; effectiveness . 
Fortunately , the Ebola outbreak is unlikely to expose Americans fully to the poor fiscal choices of the past decade . 
But the disease &apos;s sudden appearance on the global scene serves as a stark reminder of what can happen if we do not remain vigilant . 
The next epidemic could be just around the corner . 
We must ensure that we are fully prepared .
