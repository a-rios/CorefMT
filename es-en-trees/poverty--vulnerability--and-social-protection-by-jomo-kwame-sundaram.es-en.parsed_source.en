A World of Vulnerability 
ROME - In 2010 , global leaders achieved the Millennium Development Goal ( MDG ) of reducing the share of the world &apos;s poor to half of its 1990 level - five years ahead of schedule . 
But rising unemployment and falling incomes underscore the enduring threat of poverty worldwide . 
After all , poverty is not an unchanging attribute of a fixed group ; it is a condition that threatens billions of vulnerable people . 
Despite their shortcomings , income measures are useful in gaining a better understanding of the extent of poverty and vulnerability worldwide . 
But the World Bank &apos;s poverty line of $ 1.25 per day ( in purchasing-power-parity terms ) , which is used in measuring progress toward the MDGs &quot; poverty-reduction target , is not the only relevant threshold . 
When the poverty line is raised to per capita daily spending of $ 2 , the global poverty rate rises from 18 % to roughly 40 % , suggesting that many people are living just above the established poverty line , vulnerable to external shocks or changes in personal circumstances , such as price increases or income losses . 
Three-quarters of the world &apos;s poor live in rural areas , where agricultural workers suffer the highest incidence of poverty , largely owing to low productivity , seasonal unemployment , and the low wages paid by most rural employers . 
In recent decades , vulnerability and economic insecurity have increased with the rise of transient , casual , and precarious employment , including self-employment , and part-time , fixed-term , temporary , and on-call jobs . 
At-home positions , frequently filled by women , are also on the rise . 
Labor-market liberalization , globalization , and unions &quot; declining influence have exacerbated these employment trends . 
At the same time , macroeconomic policies have focused on achieving and maintaining low-single-digit inflation , rather than full employment , while limited social protection has heightened economic insecurity and vulnerability . 
During the East Asian crisis of 1997-1998 , poverty rose sharply . 
For example , Indonesia &apos;s poverty rate soared from roughly 11 % to 37 % during the crisis , mainly owing to the massive depreciation of the rupiah . 
Likewise , following the 2008 global economic crisis , food-price spikes and recession caused the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to revise its hunger estimates upward , to more than one billion people . 
Considering the FAO &apos;s conservative definition of chronic severe hunger , this is a serious indictment of global poverty-reduction efforts . 
Most poor adults in developing countries have to work , if only to survive . 
Aside from the working poor , an additional 215 million workers worldwide slipped below the poverty line in 2008-2009 , owing to the Great Recession . 
Another 5.9 % , or 185 million workers , were living on less than $ 2 per day . 
The estimated 330 million working women who lived below the poverty line in 2008-2009 accounted for roughly 60 % of the 550 million working poor worldwide . 
New estimates by the International Labor Organization ( ILO ) , based on a different methodology from that used by the World Bank , demonstrate that , while the number of those classified as working poor worldwide declined by 158 million from 2000 to 2011 ( from 25.4 % of workers to 14.8 % ) , progress has slowed markedly since 2008 . 
Indeed , only 15 % of workers , or 24 million people , managed to rise above the poverty line in 2007-2011 . 
The other 134 million workers who escaped poverty did so earlier , in 2000-2007 . 
As a result , there were 50 million more working poor in 2011 than projected by pre-crisis trends for 2002-2007 . 
The lack of basic social protection in most countries exacerbates vulnerability . 
The ILO World Social Security Report found high or very high vulnerability , in terms of poverty and labor-market informality , in 58 countries , mainly in Africa and Asia . 
Most such countries do not provide unemployment insurance , while more than 80 % of their populations lack social-security coverage and access to basic health services . 
Indeed , few countries currently provide comprehensive social protection , as defined by ILO Convention 102 ( the instrument establishing internationally-agreed minimum social-security standards ) . 
According to the ILO , only one-third of countries worldwide - accounting for roughly 28 % of the global population - provide all nine types of protection , meaning that only about 20 % of the world &apos;s working-age population ( and their families ) enjoys comprehensive coverage . 
Although all countries offer some kind of social protection or security , in most countries , coverage is severely limited and targeted at specific groups . 
As a result , only a small minority of the global population has full , legally guaranteed access to existing social-protection schemes - leaving roughly 5.6 billion people worldwide vulnerable to various degrees . 
Vulnerability exists at levels far above the World Bank &apos;s $ 1.25 / day poverty threshold , especially given rising job insecurity and inadequate social protection worldwide . 
To address global poverty effectively , global leaders must take a more comprehensive approach that focuses on reducing citizens &quot; vulnerability .
