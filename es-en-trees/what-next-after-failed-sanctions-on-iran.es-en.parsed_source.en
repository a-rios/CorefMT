What Next after Failed Sanctions on Iran ? 
LOS ANGELES amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; 
The approval of fresh sanctions on Iran marks the third time that the United Nations Security Council has been galvanized to stem the Islamic Republic &apos;s feared uranium enrichment efforts . 
Unfortunately , the new sanctions are unlikely to be any more effective than the first two rounds . 
Consider the two earlier Security Council resolutions . 
The December 2006 resolution curbed international assistance to Iran in mastering the nuclear fuel cycle . 
The March 2007 resolution called for &quot; vigilance and restraint &quot; in the sale of heavy weapons to Iran and avoidance of new grants , financial assistance , or concessional loans . 
Neither moved the country &apos;s ruling mullahs . 
The failure of targeted UN sanctions should come as no surprise . 
The US has been on the sanctions treadmill for years . 
Between 2003 and 2007 the US Treasury Department brought litigation against 94 companies for violating the ban against trade and investment in Iran . The State Department imposed sanctions 111 times against foreign entities that engaged in proliferation or terrorism-related activities with Iran . 
And both departments have used their power to freeze financial assets or access to the US financial system . 
The results amounted to little more than a pin prick . 
Iran &apos;s nuclear programs continued to be financed by international commerce . 
In 1994 , Iran exported $ 37 billion in goods ; by 2007 , the figure had nearly doubled , to $ 70 billion . 
In roughly the same period , Iran &apos;s imports also soared , from $ 22 billion in 1994 to $ 45 billion in 2006 . 
Evaluating two decades of US sanctions to curb Iran &apos;s nuclear appetite , the US Congress &apos;s Government Accountability Office recently concluded that the results are &quot; unclear , &quot; adding with candid obliqueness that &quot; some evidence , such as foreign firms signing contracts to invest in Iran &apos;s energy and Iran &apos;s continued proliferation efforts , raise questions about the extent of the sanctions &quot; impact . &quot; 
Not only have sanctions failed to halt Iran &apos;s fuel cycle programs , but so have other avenues . 
The European Union &apos;s multiple offers of political and economic inducements went nowhere , as did cajoling by the International Atomic Energy Agency . 
To be sure Iran offered , in 2005 and subsequently , to tether its program to international co-management , which arguably could have placed resident international monitors on site . 
But both the international community and Iran failed to follow through , and now that opportunity has increasingly become moot as Iranian engineers gain confidence in their handiwork . 
But Europe &apos;s negotiating experience raises doubts about that prospect , as Iran remains unequivocal about never abandoning its nuclear fuel cycle program . 
Assuming that concern over Iran &apos;s nuclear &quot; breakout &quot; capacity mounts , this leaves the US and its allies with three options , each with its own risks . 
First , a naval blockade ( reminiscent of the Cuban missile crisis ) that halted both Iran &apos;s oil exports and imports of refined fuel would cripple the country &apos;s economy . 
A halt in Iran &apos;s oil exports alone would dramatically upset international oil markets , and the Iranian leadership would likely dig in its heels to continue , if not accelerate , nuclear development . 
Second , while a military strike would slow Iran &apos;s nuclear program , facilities could be rebuilt in the absence of inspectors to find and destroy remnants , regime change , and / or military occupation . 
Moreover , the attack shock could trigger Iranian vengeance regionally and elsewhere , with a global economic impact far exceeding that implied by a blockade . 
This leaves an unsettling fallback option . 
In that event , there remains the hope that mutual nuclear deterrence will promote mutual common sense . 
Absent a dramatic improvement in the Middle East &apos;s grim political landscape , the failure of deterrence would bring the sum of all the fears of our nuclear age upon us .
