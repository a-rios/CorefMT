Palme \ u0027s Legacy 15 Years On 
STOCKHOLM : Olof Palme , Sweden &apos;s then Prime Minister , was assassinated 15 years ago on February 28th . 
His death shocked millions everywhere . 
The murderer has still not been found , at least he has not been convicted . 
The crime was an attack not only on Palme , but on democracy itself . 
Murdered , Palme is now part of history . 
So , as we recall Palme &apos;s assassination we should also remember how he behaved and what he represented . 
What , for example , is Olof Palme &apos;s legacy in foreign policy ? 
Palme was a powerful , eloquent critic of the US and the war in Vietnam . 
He cursed Soviet oppression in Czechoslovakia and General Pinochet &apos;s murders in Chile . 
Because of these stands , Palme has often been portrayed as a consistent adversary of tyrannies . 
But this is not quite true . 
Do not &quot; vilify &quot; the Soviet Union , said Palme , Chairman of Sweden &apos;s Social Democratic Party for 17 years and Prime Minister from 1969-1976 and , again , from 1982-86 . 
Do not engage in &quot; anti-Soviet agitation &quot; or &quot; the business of anti-Sovietism , &quot; he declared in 1984 , a typical neutralist stand in Palme &apos;s Sweden . 
No doubt , Palme reflected the spirit of his times . 
The West &apos;s Marxist revival after 1968 deeply impressed journalists and socialists , not least in Sweden . 
The Vietnam War changed the world view of many young people . 
Palme , however , carried this spirit forward so long after many others had seen the liberal light . 
&quot; Neither communism nor capitalism represents a dream of liberty for the peoples of Europe , &quot; he said only a few years before the peoples of East and Central Europe freed themselves from Communism to embrace democracy and capitalism . 
Palme also exploited ideological differences over diplomacy to wound other democratic parties in Sweden . 
The conservatives were lapsing into &quot; the crusading spirit , aimed at the liberation of Eastern Europe , which prevailed in conservative quarters in the West during the Cold War , &quot; he said in 1983 - a moment of heightened tension between the West and the USSR . 
Eventually , Sweden &apos;s Liberals and Conservatives , after 44 years of Socialist rule , came to power in 1976 . 
None of the threats to Sweden &apos;s foreign policy , which Palme confidently predicted , materialized in their nine years in office during the last quarter century . 
Divisive at home , Palme tried hard to divide the West at a critical moment . 
In the 1980s Social Democrats in Sweden and Germany developed a close ideological collaboration in foreign affairs . 
The so-called &quot; Palme Commission &quot; ( including the influential Egon Bahr ) suggested a policy of &quot; common security &quot; between East and West , and nuclear weapon-free zones instead of NATO &apos;s policy of deploying cruise and Pershing II missiles to counter the Soviet advantage in theater nuclear weapons . 
This alliance between the two parties led to serious distortions of fundamental Western values . 
Palme and Oskar Lafontaine , then one of the leaders of the opposition in Germany , did not see the Cold War as primarily a conflict between freedom and tyranny . 
When Palme visited East Germany in 1984 he never criticized repression there , nor the Berlin Wall . 
Instead , Palme praised East Germany &apos;s leader , Erich Honecker , underlining shared goals and the mutual struggle for peace and development . 
Palme &apos;s main speech mentioned &quot; d√©tente , &quot; &quot; trust , &quot; and &quot; friendship , &quot; but never &quot; freedom . &quot; 
Much the same happened when Palme visited Cuba . 
He shared a podium with Fidel Castro at a mass rally in Santiago de Cuba . 
Palme spoke appreciatively of &quot; socialist revolution , &quot; never mentioning his own party &apos;s conviction that &quot; revolution &quot; should take place only after free and honest elections . 
Indeed , Palme used Marxist slogans , but said nothing about human rights and political freedom , giving the impression that Sweden and Cuba embraced similar ideologies . 
In a joint statement with Castro , Palme claimed that the two men were united in all the areas they had discussed . 
They even confirmed their happiness that the struggles for freedom of &quot; the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples have been crowned with victory . &quot; 
This was said in the summer of 1975 , two months after Cambodia &apos;s Khmer Rouge embarked on a genocide that killed two million of the country &apos;s seven million people . 
Was Olof Palme unaware of Pol Pot &apos;s massacres ? 
Newspapers in almost all democracies , including Sweden , were informing us of the Cambodian horrors . 
Palme , however , thought it more important to present a united front with Cuba &apos;s tyrant than to worry about atrocities committed by Communists in Indochina . 
Palme , indeed , seldom condemned oppression in Third World countries . 
He constantly condemned apartheid in South Africa , yet he never criticized Mao &apos;s China , the most murderous regime to arise after World War II . 
This double standard was particularly pernicious in the Middle East , where Palme never censured an Arab country , regardless of its corruption or cruelty . 
The only nation in that region he repeatedly attacked was its only democracy , Israel . 
He even equated the Israelis with the Nazis . 
Fifteen years after his murder , Sweden and the West must grapple with what Palme left behind , his anti-Western agitation and his willingness to see fundamental ideals of freedom as merely relative values . 
For people seeking or defending democracy and human rights , Palme was an unreliable partner . 
It is that aspect of his moral &quot; example &quot; that should be recalled .
