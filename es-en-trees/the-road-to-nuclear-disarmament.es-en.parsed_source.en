The Road to Nuclear Disarmament 
NEW YORK - Weapons of mass destruction and disarmament form one of the gravest challenges facing the world . One of my priorities as United Nations Secretary-General is to promote global public goods and remedies to challenges that do not respect borders . 
A world free of nuclear weapons is a global public good of the highest order . 
My interest in this subject stems partly from personal experience . 
My homeland , South Korea , has suffered the ravages of conventional war and faced threats from nuclear weapons and other WMD . 
But , of course , such threats are not unique to Asia . 
Despite a longstanding taboo against using nuclear weapons , disarmament remains only an aspiration . 
So , is a taboo merely on the use of such weapons sufficient ? 
States make the key decisions where nuclear weapons are concerned . 
But the UN has important roles to play . 
We provide a central forum in which states can agree on norms to serve their common interests . 
We analyze , educate , and advocate in the pursuit of agreed goals . 
Most states have chosen to forgo nuclear weapons , and have complied with their commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
Yet some states view such weapons as a status symbol , and some view them as offering the ultimate deterrent against nuclear attack , which largely accounts for the estimated 26,000 that still exist . 
Unfortunately , the doctrine of nuclear deterrence is contagious , making non-proliferation more difficult and raising new risks that nuclear weapons will be used . 
The world remains concerned about nuclear activities in North Korea and Iran , and there is widespread support for efforts to address these concerns by peaceful means . 
There are also concerns that a &quot; nuclear renaissance &quot; is looming , with nuclear energy seen as a clean energy alternative at a time of intensifying efforts to combat climate change . 
The main worry is that this will lead to the production and use of more nuclear materials that must be protected against proliferation and terrorist threats . 
The obstacles to disarmament are formidable . 
But the costs and risks of its alternatives never get the attention they deserve . 
Consider the enormous opportunity cost of huge military budgets . 
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , global military expenditures last year exceeded $ 1.3 trillion . 
Ten years ago , the Brookings Institution published a study that estimated the total costs of nuclear weapons in the United States alone to be over $ 5.8 trillion , including future cleanup costs . 
By any definition , this is a huge investment that could have had many other productive uses . 
Concerns over nuclear weapons &quot; costs and inherent dangers have led to a global outpouring of ideas to breathe new life into nuclear disarmament . 
We have seen the WMD Commission led by Hans Blix , the New Agenda Coalition , and Norway &apos;s Seven Nation Initiative . 
Australia and Japan have launched the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament . 
Civil society groups and nuclear-weapon states have also made proposals , such as the Hoover Plan , spearheaded by Henry Kissinger . 
I would like to offer my own five-point proposal . 
First , I urge all NPT parties , in particular the nuclear-weapon states , to fulfill their obligation under the treaty to undertake negotiations on effective measures leading to nuclear disarmament . 
They could agree on a framework of separate , mutually reinforcing instruments . 
I have circulated to all UN members a draft of such a convention , which offers a good point of departure . 
The nuclear powers should actively engage with other states on this issue at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva , the world &apos;s single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum . 
The world would also welcome a resumption of bilateral negotiations between the US and Russia aimed at deep and verifiable reductions of their arsenals . 
Governments should also invest more in verification research and development . 
The United Kingdom &apos;s proposal to host a conference of nuclear-weapon states on verification is a concrete step in the right direction . 
Second , the Security Council &apos;s permanent members should begin discussions on security issues in the nuclear disarmament process . 
They could unambiguously assure non-nuclear-weapon states that they will not be subject to the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons . 
The Council could also convene a summit on nuclear disarmament . 
Non-NPT states should freeze their own nuclear-weapon capabilities and make their own disarmament commitments . 
Third , unilateral moratoria on nuclear tests and the production of fissile materials can go only so far . 
We need new efforts to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty into force , and for the Conference on Disarmament to begin negotiations on a fissile material treaty immediately , without preconditions . 
I support the creation of the Central Asian and African nuclear-weapon-free zones , and strongly support efforts to establish such a zone in the Middle East . 
And I urge all NPT parties to conclude their safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , and voluntarily to adopt the strengthened safeguards under the Additional Protocol . 
Fourth , the nuclear-weapon states often circulate descriptions of what they are doing to pursue these goals . 
But these accounts seldom reach the public . 
I invite the nuclear-weapon states to send such material to the UN Secretariat , and to encourage its wider dissemination . 
The lack of an authoritative estimate of the total number of nuclear weapons attests to the need for greater transparency . 
Finally , a number of complementary measures are needed . 
These include eliminating other types of WMD ; new efforts against WMD terrorism ; limits on the production and trade in conventional arms ; and new weapons bans , including of missiles and space weapons . 
If there is real , verified progress on disarmament , the ability to eliminate the nuclear threat will grow exponentially . 
As we progressively eliminate the world &apos;s deadliest weapons and their components , we will make it harder to execute WMD terrorist attacks . 
These proposals offer a fresh start not only on disarmament , but also on strengthening our system of international peace and security .
