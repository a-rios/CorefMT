The Kremlin &apos;s Failing Monopoly 
CAMBRIDGE - Ever since Vladimir Putin came to power a decade ago , the Kremlin regime has relied on two pillars : the security forces and energy exports . 
By suppressing internal rivals and absorbing their assets , the regime created a dual monopoly . 
Redistributing some of the profits from high energy prices enabled the regime to improve living standards and make itself popular with ordinary Russians . 
And resolving internal problems through a disproportionate use of force reassured even the regime &apos;s security obsessed ex-KGB men . 
Until recently , this combination of carrots and sticks functioned effectively . 
The virtual absence of popular protest in Russia during the Putin years seems amazing . 
Now that happy union between the Kremlin and ordinary Russians is ending . 
Few Russian policymakers , much less the Russian public , expected oil and gas prices to collapse as they have . 
We do not know what will happen next . 
If prices rebound , Putin and his people will glorify themselves for their wisdom . 
It is no coincidence that George W. Bush &apos;s and Putin &apos;s disastrous presidencies were cotemporaneous . 
By driving up energy prices , Bush was Putin &apos;s greatest ally , with Putin returning the favor by refocusing Russia from its multiple problems to &quot; terrorism . &quot; 
Both sought to undo the work of their successful predecessors , Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin . 
Both led their countries into traps with which their successors must deal . 
When Bush said that he liked what he saw in Putin &apos;s eyes , he meant it . 
Since Soviet times , the Kremlin has traditionally been wary about Democratic administrations in the United States . 
John F. Kennedy refused to tolerate the Soviet military presence in Cuba . 
Jimmy Carter boycotted the Moscow Olympics . 
Clinton led the successful operation against Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s Serbia , the Kremlin &apos;s best friend in Europe . 
And Obama &apos;s triumph heralded the fall in oil prices . 
With energy revenues screeching to a halt , Putin &apos;s regime will lose popularity . 
And Putin cannot avoid responsibility . 
If the Kremlin claimed credit for the oil- and gas-fired prosperity of the past six years - prosperity due solely to economic exuberance elsewhere in the world - the Kremlin should be accountable for the current devastation . 
Americans today compare their current crisis to the Great Depression ; 
In 1998 , the whole world , which was then enjoying a global boom , looked at Russia with sympathy . 
Things could not be more different now . 
In 1998 , Russians did not yet take for granted imported cars , foreign tourism , and other middle-class perks . 
The ruling group in the Kremlin was variegated and conflict-ridden , but its response to the crisis was effective and even creative . 
Now , the ruling group is uniform , unanimous , and most likely unfit for any serious revision of policy . 
It is a dangerous situation . 
Though the current level of anti-Americanism in Russia &apos;s official media seems unprecedented , the regime is most worried about internal problems . 
During the current financial crisis , which hit Russia right after the war with Georgia last August , the Kremlin and the Duma issued a series of laws and orders that have turned Putin &apos;s authoritarianism into a dictatorship . 
Opposition parties have become negligible . 
The oligarchs &quot; businesses have been largely nationalized . 
The presidential term has been extended . 
Industrial centers with growing unemployment will receive more troops . 
Trial by jury , which was infrequent anyway , is being seen less and less . 
The concept of high treason is bandied about almost daily . 
We will see more persecution of scientists , journalists , and businessmen , whose work with international charities , media , or corporations will now be construed as treachery . 
Some of these people will be murdered rather than tried ; others will be tried by state-appointed judges rather than murdered . 
But this is not news anymore in Putin &apos;s Russia . 
Can Putin &apos;s dual monopoly survive them ? 
Perhaps , but it will do so only if it risks deep change , a new perestroika rather than simply a thaw . 
But it is more likely that the regime is too rigid and too blinkered to act .
