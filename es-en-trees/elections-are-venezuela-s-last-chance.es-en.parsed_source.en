Elections Are Venezuela \ u0027s Last Chance 
Venezuela is mired in a dangerous stalemate . 
President Hugo Chávez clings to power despite the obvious failings of his government : severe economic deterioration and dangerous political polarization . 
The opposition , tainted by their botched coup of April 2002 , now seeks to force Chávez from office through a costly general strike . 
Both sides justify their intransigence with one-sided interpretations . 
His sympathizers glorify Chávez as a defender of the poor besieged by a selfish , coup-plotting elite . 
His fiercest opponents demonize Chávez as an autocrat pursuing a Cuban-style revolution and destroying democracy . 
Both interpretations are flawed . 
The Chávez government has not helped Venezuela &apos;s poor in any significant way . 
On the contrary , his belligerent rhetoric and inept governance scared off investors , inciting economic decline and boosting unemployment and poverty . 
Now Chávez lacks majority backing even among the poor . 
The opposition comprises most of Venezuela &apos;s organized civil society , not only business , but also trade unions , professional associations , and NGOs . 
So Venezuela &apos;s polarization does not pit &quot; the poor &quot; against &quot; the oligarchy , &quot; but a populist against civil society . 
The opposition &apos;s view - shared by rightists in the Bush administration - is equally unconvincing . 
Rather than initiating a revolution , Chávez merely spouts fiery rhetoric . 
While his democratic credentials are dubious , he has not acted in an openly authoritarian fashion . 
True , he has systematically concentrated power in his own hands and has undermined governmental checks and balances . 
But while harassing the opposition , he has not overturned the minimal principles of democracy . 
Indeed , he now invokes his formal democratic legitimacy to fend off demands for his resignation . 
But Chávez &apos;s insistence on the inviolability of the current constitution is hypocritical . 
Four years ago , Chávez deviated from the old constitution by using a plebiscite to engineer a new one , tailor-made for him . 
Now he invokes that charter to block calls for a plebiscite on his continuation in office . 
The paradox here is that Chávez &apos;s earlier example may provide the solution to today &apos;s standoff . 
As Chávez used para-constitutional means to advance a desire for change in 1999 , so the international community should not be confined by the present constitution in pressing to resolve a crisis that is ruining the country . 
In fact , the Latin American members of the &quot; group of friendly nations &quot; trying to mediate this conflict can draw on interesting experiences to design such a solution . 
After all , confrontations like this are not unusual in Latin America &apos;s rigid presidential systems . 
When chief executives with fixed terms of office lose political support , they cannot be removed through a no-confidence vote , as in parliamentary systems . 
Presidential systems therefore risk lengthy stand-offs that threaten democracy - as in Venezuela today . 
But over the last decade , Latin American politicians have made presidential systems more flexible by finding innovative ways to remove unpopular presidents . 
One of Chávez &apos;s discredited predecessors was impeached on flimsy charges of malfeasance ; 
While politicians interpreted the law with a good deal of creativity in these instances , they usually did so to ensure the survival of fragile democracies facing a crisis . 
As long as these maneuvers do not proliferate and turn into easy ammunition for the opposition of the moment , they may provide a safety valve for presidential systems . 
International monitoring can also safeguard against frivolous use of such mechanisms . 
It is to be hoped that the group of friendly nations can help design an innovative solution to Venezuela &apos;s standoff . 
To be acceptable to both sides , such a solution must deviate from the favorite proposals of each . 
The opposition prefers an &quot; up-or-down &quot; vote on Chávez &apos;s continuation in office , which it would most likely win - and which Chávez will never accept . 
Chávez insists on the recall referendum mechanism included in his constitution , which the opposition cannot tolerate : removing the president in this way would require a larger absolute number of votes than Chávez garnered in the last election . 
But rising abstention makes this virtually impossible . 
Both proposals are thus politically unfeasible . 
Only a democratic mechanism for conflict resolution that has an uncertain outcome has any chance of being adopted . 
That mechanism is an election , to be held as soon as possible ( realistically , by this summer ) . 
Both sides will have to work hard if they want to win . 
The fractious opposition will need to go beyond rejection of Chávez , elaborate a program for the country &apos;s reconstruction , and unite behind an attractive candidate . 
President Chávez will need to clarify the content and meaning of his &quot; Bolivarian Revolution . &quot; 
Since Chávez is a skilled campaigner and the opposition so far lacks unity , he will have a realistic chance of winning - which should make a new contest acceptable to him . 
Pressure from the group of friendly nations may induce both sides to accept this last chance to avoid a political and economic meltdown . 
Elections can be made legitimate through a constitutional amendment shortening the presidential term , as proposed by Jimmy Carter in his recent mediation effort . 
Since this is designed to defuse an exceptional crisis , it would not become a precedent that encourages frivolous attacks on Latin America &apos;s democratically elected governments . 
An election now in Venezuela will save , not undermine , democracy .
