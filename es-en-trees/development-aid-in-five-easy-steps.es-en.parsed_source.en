Development Aid in Five Easy Steps 
NEW YORK ­ ­ - Every country , rich and poor , should ensure universal coverage of primary health care , including safe childbirth , nutrition , vaccines , malaria control , and clinical services . 
Each year , nearly nine million children die of conditions that could be prevented or treated , and nearly 400,000 women die because of complications during pregnancy . 
Almost all of these deaths are in the world &apos;s poorest countries . 
Ending these deaths would not only reduce suffering , but would also unleash economic prosperity in impoverished and unstable societies . 
The greatest barrier to doing so is that the poorest countries can &apos;t afford universal primary health care , even though the cost per person is very low . 
Using immunizations , modern medicines , state-of-the-art diagnostics , mobile phones , and other new technologies , universal primary health care is now highly effective and very inexpensive , costing around $ 54 per person per year in the poorest countries . 
Yet , because of their very low incomes , the poorest countries can afford only around $ 14 per person from their national budgets . 
Financial help from abroad is needed to cover roughly $ 40 per person per year . 
With approximately one billion impoverished people still lacking primary health care , the total sum needed is around $ 40 billion per year . Foreign donors - including the United States , the European Union , and Japan - are currently contributing around one-third of that , roughly $ 14 billion per year . 
The remaining annual financial gap is therefore about $ 26 billion . 
With that money , the lives of many millions of mothers and children would be saved each year . 
This is not a lot of money for the rich countries , but they fail to come up with it . 
The most obvious gap is in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria , a global initiative to help the poorest countries fight these killer diseases . 
The Global Fund is desperately short of money , yet the Obama administration and other governments are not responding to the financial need . 
The rich countries could easily come up with the money . 
First , the US could end its expensive and failed war in Afghanistan , which is costing around $ 100 billion per year . 
If the US gave a tiny fraction of that $ 100 billion in development aid for Afghanistan , it would be far more successful in achieving peace and stability in that war-ravaged country . 
For example , the US could give $ 25 billion in development aid each year and another $ 25 billion for global health , and still save $ 50 billion each year to reduce the US budget deficit . 
Afghanistan , and hence the US , would be far safer , the world would be far healthier , and the US economy would benefit enormously . 
A second approach would be to tax the big international banks , which are earning excessive profits on their speculative trading . 
Even after Wall Street nearly wrecked the world economy , the US government coddled and protected it , enabling its return to huge profits - perhaps $ 50 billion - last year . 
The bankers again paid themselves huge bonuses - more than $ 20 billion for 2009 . 
This money should have gone to the world &apos;s poorest people rather than to the bankers , who certainly did not earn it . 
It is time for an international tax on bank profits - perhaps implemented as a levy on international financial transactions - which would raise tens of billions of dollars each year . 
In pressing the case for such a tax , the developing countries should not accept the meager excuses offered by the US and other countries in order to protect their bankers . 
A third approach would be to obtain increased contributions from the world &apos;s richest people . 
Several of them , including Bill Gates , George Soros , Warren Buffett , and Jeffrey Skoll , are already mega-philanthropists , committing huge sums for the world &apos;s good . 
Yet other billionaires have yet to make comparable donations . 
According to the most recent Forbes list , there are 1,011 billionaires in the world , with a combined net worth of $ 3.5 trillion dollars . 
This means that if each billionaire would contribute 0.7 % of their net worth , the total sum would be $ 25 billion per year . 
Just imagine , 1,000 people could ensure primary health care for one billion impoverished people . 
A fourth approach should be to look to a company like Exxon-Mobil , which earns billions of dollars each year in Africa but , according to one of the company &apos;s online reports , spent only around $ 5 million per year on malaria control programs in Africa from 2000 to 2007 . 
Exxon-Mobil could and should be funding much more of the continent &apos;s urgently needed primary health services , either out of royalties paid by the company or out of corporate philanthropic donations . 
Fifth , new donor countries , such as Brazil , China , India , and Korea , have the vision , energy , economic dynamism , and diplomatic interest to expand their donor support in the poorest countries , as well as in the poorest parts of their own countries . 
If the US and Europe are too neglectful to do their part , the emerging economies can and will pick up part of the slack . 
Fortunately , these new donors are becoming trusted partners in Africa . 
The rich world says that it lacks the money to do more , but what it lacks is imagination , not resources . 
The US should divert its wasteful military spending to new health financing . 
The world should implement a global bank tax . 
The billionaires should step up their philanthropy . 
The oil companies should pay more . 
New donor countries like China can fill the financing gap left by the traditional donor countries . 
The money is there . 
The needs are urgent . 
The challenge is one of morality and vision .
