The End of Austria \ u0027s Social Partnership ? 
Few changes of government in Europe attract sensational journalism of the type that Austria &apos;s October 1999 elections - which brought Jörg Haider &apos;s Freedom Party into government - did . 
Two years later , with the EU sanctions imposed after the government &apos;s formation now lifted , it is time to assess the impact of this government on Austria &apos;s economy , the field where the ruling coalition &apos;s pre-election rhetoric promised the biggest changes . 
To understand what Austria &apos;s government is doing , it is necessary to understand where Austria has been . 
Austria &apos;s economy performed solidly throughout the 1990s , roughly in line with EU and Euro Area averages . 
Yet , due to Austria &apos;s accession to the EU in 1995 and the country &apos;s trade and investment in reshaping neighboring economies in Eastern Europe , many Austrians expected higher growth . 
Two factors incited Austria &apos;s lower than expected economic dynamics : delayed fiscal consolidation and lagging structural reforms . 
Efforts at fiscal consolidation in the 1990s were usually followed by wider structural deficits , and although market reforms were discussed , few were implemented . 
Both problems contributed to the breakdown of the long-ruling coalition government of Social Democrats and Conservatives ( the Volkspartei ) . 
The Conservative and Freedom Party coalition formed after the 1999 elections confronted a difficult job . 
Although the program of the coalition partners shared many points , a contradiction existed concerning Europe . 
By introducing more flexibility in product and labor markets and by committing itself to overhaul public sector management , the Conservatives hoped that Austria would increase its competitiveness and thus achieve higher growth . 
In contrast , the Freedom Party has never been Pro-European , at least since 1990 ; nor has it been open to EU accession by former communist states in Eastern Europe . 
The EU sanctions imposed on Austria after the election boosted the Freedom Party by attracting anti-European sentiments within Austria to it . 
As a consequence , it remains unclear whether or not Austria &apos;s current government looks at Europe and EU expansion eastward as a basis on which to secure a better international profile and added growth . 
Early on in its tenure , the coalition government initiated a stability program designed to eliminate the government &apos;s deficit by 2002 . 
This goal may be achieved this year , mainly by raising revenues in the form of higher indirect taxes ( e.g. , levies on electricity , increases on the vehicle insurance tax , tobacco tax , as well as by introducing tuition fees at universities ) . 
Stricter corporate taxes were also adopted . 
On the expenditure side , structural measures were implemented , notably pension reform as well as phased reductions in government employment and a more focused targeting of social transfers . 
But these expenditure restraints are occurring only slowly , which means that the stability program is front-loaded with an increased tax burden reaching unprecedented levels . 
These steps towards a balanced budget were , in part , courageous because they stirred up resistance by the people and institutions affected . 
Some measures were well-designed , such as reform of the state pension system ( although a need for further reform remains ) - while others , such as the measures aimed at raising revenues and reducing costs in the health care system , were too hastily implemented - e.g. the new system of health co-payments requires redesign . 
Moreover , so far , health care reform has failed to yield the savings that were expected . 
The new government also began to change broad areas of public administration . 
It reduced government employment , granted only moderate wage increases and slashed public investment . 
All this helped consolidate the budget but created a climate of opposition . 
Administrative reforms normally require meticulous preparation , which the government tried to generate quickly through a study conducted by the Task Reform Commission , which was published in March 2001 . 
So far , suggestions as to how to raise public sector efficiency are numerous , but legislative initiatives , based on the Commission &apos;s suggestions , are rare or have not been worked out satisfactorily . 
Admittedly , it is politically difficult to turn government agencies into more entrepreneurial units . 
Past experience in Austria has shown few positive examples . 
One reason may be that entrepreneurial spin-offs were often created with unrealistic goals and without any thorough analyses of the expected benefits and costs . 
In 2000 and 2001 , many state holdings in industry were privatized , sharply reducing the debt position of the mother company of the nationalized industries ( ÖIAG ) . 
Its debts stem from a decision , taken by the old coalition government , whereby the losses of nationalized industries were assumed by the state . 
In addition to continued privatization , many policy measures were initiated by the new government that aimed to improve the functioning of the market : e.g. , opening the electricity and gas markets to competition ahead of other EU countries , opening the telecommunication sector , strengthening equity markets through changes in the tax system , unification of financial market supervision and other measures . 
Despite these reforms , many inflexibilities remain . 
For example , shop opening-hours still must comply with highly restrictive rules . 
Indeed , within the OECD , Austria retains one of the tightest retail sector regulations . 
Many labor market inflexibilities also persist . 
But a deeper question about the nature of Austria &apos;s political / economic system remains unanswered . 
Austria &apos;s economic success and political stability after World War II was premised on a system of social partnership . 
Economic policy was often determined by the four social partners : the Chamber of Commerce , the association of Chambers of Agriculture , the Chamber of Labor , and the Austrian Trade Union . 
The first are associated with the Conservatives , the latter two with the Social Democrats . 
The formation of the Conservative / Freedom Party coalition government called that partnership into question . 
The short-term consequences of this may not be negative , since it was a lack of agreement among the social partners that caused the structural problems of the 1990s to go unresolved . 
So the current government &apos;s efforts to resolve them may be helpful . 
But the long-term consequences of a breakdown in the social partnership remain unknown . 
Given that social partnership delivered stability and prosperity to Austria for decades , it must be hoped that today &apos;s changes serve as a catalyst for renewed social consensus .
