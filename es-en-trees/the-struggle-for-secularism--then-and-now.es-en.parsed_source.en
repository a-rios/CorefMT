The Struggle for Secularism , Then and Now 
It is a strange irony that France is poised to celebrate the centenary of the law of December 9 , 1905 , that separated church and state at the very moment disorders have been roiling its cities . 
The struggle between church and state for political mastery goes back to the Middle Ages , when Philippe le Bel &apos;s jurists sought to impose royal power over the Roman Catholic Church in France . 
Centuries later , the French Revolution provided liberty of conscience and religion across France . 
The rabid anti-clericalism of the Revolutionary period gave way to more balanced church-state relations , with the Concordat agreed in 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII - an agreement that still applies in Alsace and parts of Lorraine today . 
Throughout the nineteenth century , Catholicism &apos;s public role bred cruel fights between supporters of the clergy and their opponents , reflecting a more fundamental conflict between supporters of the Republic and advocates of a return to the old order . 
From the 1880 &quot; s onward , as the Republic took root , a secular ideology arose that sought to emancipate state institutions ­ - the educational system , first and foremost - from clerical influence . 
Passionate battles marked the secularization of schooling , and later the fight against religious congregations . 
With the outbreak of the Dreyfus affair , the religious question appeared more clearly than ever as a major political issue . 
The law of 1905 - regarded by many to be the founding text of French secularism - was thus the culmination of a long historical process . 
While it may seem to be a declaration of war on religion , in many ways the law &apos;s main aim is appeasement . 
Its first article declares that the Republic certifies liberty of conscience and &quot; guarantees the free practice of worship under the sole restrictions enacted ( ... ) by the interest of the public order . &quot; 
Its second article specifies that &quot; the Republic does not recognize , pay , or subsidize any cult . &quot; 
Thus , the state guarantees freedom of worship but does not interfere in the ways that different religious bodies function . 
France &apos;s high court , the Conseil d &quot; État , has enshrined this key principle : restrictions on faith to promote public order are legitimate , but they must not prevent people from worshiping . 
So the 1905 law - which established the process of maintaining a secular state known as laïcité - marks a balance between two purposes : the rejection of state control over religion , and the rejection of religion &apos;s takeover of the state . 
France is the only European country to proclaim its secular nature in its constitution , whereas Germany &apos;s Basic Law refers to God and the Irish Constitution to the Holy Trinity . 
Church-state relations across Europe are extremely diverse . 
Some countries have a state church ( United Kingdom , Denmark , Finland , Greece ) , some , like France , assert their secularism , and some combine separation of church and state with special treatment for certain denominations ( Spain , Italy , Ireland , Sweden , and Portugal ) or otherwise provide such recognition ( Germany , Belgium , Austria , Luxemburg ) .But in reality , EU countries have more in common than what can be inferred from those differences . 
In recent years , the French vision of a secular state has been increasingly called into question by the growing influence of Islam , which is now the France &apos;s second religion , at least in terms of the number of adherents . 
In order to help Islam find its place among France &apos;s religions , the state encouraged the creation of a body to represent all French Muslim communities.During the last decade , the debate over the wearing of headscarves by Muslim schoolgirls aroused a new round of controversy about the meaning of laïcité . 
A majority of French teachers saw the wearing of headscarves as the work of an organized movement that aimed to question the religious neutrality of schools - and even to contest , as the Roman Catholic Church did centuries ago , the very principles of the Enlightenment . 
It was this seeming provocation that inspired lawmakers to act , for they feared a communal divide within the educational system . 
After two years of experimentation , this renewed statement of the primacy of laïcité in France looks like an indisputable success . 
More recently , calls to modify the 1905 law have been renewed . 
France &apos;s proclivity for highly ideological politics has merely aggravated an already polarized debate . 
Then again , much is at stake in that debate . 
The law of 1905 marked a settlement of a divisive battle that must not be re-fought . 
There is no room in France for a new religious war . 
Indeed , when compared to other democratic countries , official secularism no longer appears to be just another exception française . 
On the contrary , secularism - whatever its particular legal framework - and democracy are intertwined . 
They must remain so .
