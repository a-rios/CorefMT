America Wakes Up to Climate Change 
After years of debate in the United States , and opposition to action by the Bush administration , America is finally waking up to the reality of global climate change . 
Leadership is still not coming from the president , but the private sector has begun to act . 
Leaders of major US companies have decided that global man-made climate change is real , must be controlled , and that business must play a constructive part in the process . 
Thus , even as the Bush administration and some scientific contrarians pretend that there is no problem , US corporate leaders are seeking practical solutions . 
The basic situation has been clear for years . 
Global use of fossil fuels is contributing to a sharp rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide , which is causing the Earth to warm . 
Rainfall patterns are changing . 
Deserts and dry regions are becoming drier . 
Extreme weather events such as hurricanes and typhoons are likely to increase . 
Flooding in Europe is likely to intensify , a process that may already have begun . 
Sea levels are rising , and could climb sharply if global warming leads to a destabilization of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets . 
In short , the scientific evidence is strong and growing that the planet is at grave risk , with many ill effects already being felt and more to come . 
The proper responses are also increasingly understood . 
We must move to a sustainable energy system , one that does not mean a huge increase of carbon in the atmosphere . 
This will require a shift to renewable energy sources such as solar power , and perhaps nuclear power , as well as new technologies to capture carbon dioxide at power plants and then to dispose of the carbon dioxide in safe underground deposits . 
Society will have to pay a price for these investments in new energy technologies , but the benefits will be vastly greater than the price . 
The US is the world &apos;s major emitter of carbon dioxide from energy use , but it has done the least among all major economies to confront the global challenge . 
The Bush administration claims that more research is needed before any action is taken . 
Yet real action in the US is starting , thanks to leadership in other parts of the world , and thanks to the enlightened understanding of some major American businesses . 
First , the rest of the world ratified the Kyoto Protocol to control emissions of carbon dioxide . 
At the beginning of this year , Europe introduced a new Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme that uses market-based incentives to control carbon emissions . 
American companies operating in Europe are part of that system for their European-based emissions , so that US companies are being pulled into climate control even if their own government avoids the issue . 
Second , major US investors , such as pension fund managers , are realizing that US companies that fail to control their emissions may be vulnerable to financial losses in the future . 
They know that , sooner or later , the US will have to join the rest of the world in controlling climate change . 
At that point , power companies that use antiquated technologies that emit massive amounts of greenhouse gases may face serious financial losses . 
So investors are telling companies to report their carbon emissions today in order to assess future liabilities . 
Similarly , many company bosses know that pretending that climate problems do not exist is bad for shareholders , because reality will one day strike . 
They know that investing today in clean technologies can give them a long-term competitive advantage . 
As a result , many companies are taking steps now to limit their emissions to avoid future financial liabilities and a lack of investor confidence . 
The most dramatic breakthrough of this kind occurred when General Electric , one of the world &apos;s most important , innovative , and respected companies , announced that it was going &quot; green &quot; with a major new corporate focus on environmentally sound technologies and a commitment to limit its own greenhouse gas emissions . 
With GE &apos;s leadership , which it termed &quot; ecomagination &quot; ( combining ecology with imagination ) , many US businesses are sure to follow . 
It is too early to count on success in engaging the US on climate change . 
The Bush administration continues to delay and to avoid sound science . 
Yet it is reasonably clear that a tipping point has been reached . 
Reality is catching up with the US , as it already has elsewhere in the world . 
As US citizens and businesses continue to suffer the results of climate change - heat waves , droughts , hurricanes , and floods - more and more Americans , including an increasing number of business leaders , will press America &apos;s political leaders for real action . 
The solutions will not be easy , and the effort must last over many decades in all parts of the world . 
But the effort needs to start now . 
As with Europe &apos;s new carbon trading , all producers and consumers around the globe will need to face market incentives to adopt technologies and consumption patterns that slow ( and eventually stop ) the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . 
We will all need to pay a &quot; market price &quot; when we contribute to global climate change , so that we give true economic incentives to sustainable energy systems and new public investments - for example , mass transit - that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thereby head off future climatic disasters .
