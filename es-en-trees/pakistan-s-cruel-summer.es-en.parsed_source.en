Pakistan &apos;s Cruel Summer 
LAHORE - July was one of the roughest months in Pakistan &apos;s history . 
The country &apos;s establishment was blamed for duplicity in the American war effort in Afghanistan , backing both sides - the United States and the Taliban - at the same time . 
There was considerable public anger in Pakistan at the way British Prime Minister David Cameron handled such suspicions , some of which was directed at President Asif Ali Zardari , who decided to proceed with a planned official visit to London despite Cameron &apos;s harsh language . 
Public anger at the charges coming from America and Britain about Pakistan &apos;s Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) increased as round-the-clock television coverage showed the devastation and suffering caused by floods in the country &apos;s northwest , the worst in more than 80 years . 
The military launched a major effort to help those affected . 
Its commander , General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani , whose tenure in office was recently , and unusually , extended for an additional three years , was alone among Pakistan &apos;s senior leaders in visiting the flood-affected areas and showing concern about the suffering . 
And this was not the only crisis in which the military leadership seemed to be doing what the public thought was right . 
The Wikileaks publication of raw US intelligence reports from Afghanistan confirmed what had long been suspected . 
A number of field reports described contacts between the ISI and the Taliban , even as the ISI was engaged in fighting some the Taliban in Pakistan . 
The records contained firsthand accounts of the anger felt by Americans at the ISI &apos;s unwillingness to confront the insurgents , in particular those who were attacking US and NATO troops near the Pakistani border . 
The ISI seemed to be keeping its lines of communications open to some Taliban in the hope that they could be used as a reserve force in case of another military confrontation with India or a precipitous American withdrawal from Afghanistan . 
This theme of apparent Pakistani duplicity was picked up by Cameron . 
In a speech delivered before an audience of Indian business leaders in Bangalore , he accused Pakistan of being on both sides of the Afghan equation . 
Cameron &apos;s remarks were deeply resented in Pakistan . 
They left the impression that Britain was prepared to humiliate Pakistan publicly in order to curry favor with the Indians . 
The strategy may work over the short term in winning export orders for British firms from India . 
Indeed , the prime minister &apos;s team won at least one major contract - for the sale of military aircraft worth more than a billion dollars . 
The Pakistani public demanded a quick , decisive rebuke of Britain from the country &apos;s leadership . 
It came from the military . 
After hesitating , Zardari arrived in London three days later . 
Pakistan &apos;s civilian government also seemed to be dropping the ball in the economic field , as poor management by the authorities was driving the country towards another crisis . 
Partly because of the floods , which will shave off at least 1 % from GDP , partly because of the administration &apos;s inability and unwillingness to curb non-essential expenditures , and partly because of slowing export growth , Pakistan is once again facing serious fiscal and balance-of-payments problems . 
This time , however , foreign help might not be as readily available as it was in , say , 2008 . 
The government anticipated 4.1 % GDP growth in 2010-2011 . 
It will be lucky if it manages to achieve 2.8 % , one half of that expected in Bangladesh and one-third of that projected for India . 
Pakistan is now the sick man of South Asia , with three consecutive years of growth below 3 % causing the number of people living in absolute poverty to increase by 10 million . 
Much of this increase is occurring in large cities where discontent was already mounting in response to the government &apos;s palpable failure to provide basic goods and services . 
These deepening crises on several fronts - some attributed to poor governance - raise the question once again as to whether Pakistan can sustain its democracy . 
The military &apos;s high and positive profile seems to suggest that it is the only institution left in a tottering state that seems able to stabilize a delicate situation . 
But will Pakistan &apos;s military once more inject itself directly into the political arena , as it has done four times in the six decades since independence ? 
Or will the country &apos;s civilian leaders mend their ways ? 
The difference between today and the periods that preceded other Pakistani coups is that an active civil society , an unconstrained electronic and print media , and an assertive judiciary may be able to keep the military in the barracks and force the politicians onto the right track . 
Nevertheless , July was a cruel month for Pakistan , and more seem certain to follow .
