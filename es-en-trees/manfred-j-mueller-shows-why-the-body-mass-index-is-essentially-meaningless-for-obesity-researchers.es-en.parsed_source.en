The Unbearable Lightness of BMI 
KIEL - Now is the time of year when many people most dread stepping onto the bathroom scale . 
But , while all of that holiday feasting may have led to greater girth , how should we understand what higher or lower body weight means ? 
The body mass index ( BMI ) has long been used in epidemiology , medicine , and nutritional sciences . 
But its value is increasingly being questioned , especially in obesity research , where body-composition measurements are proving to be far more relevant . 
The BMI is calculated by dividing a person &apos;s body weight in kilograms by the square of his height in meters ( kg / m2 ) . 
First named after the Belgian astronomer , mathematician , and statistician Adolphe Quetelet , who demonstrated in 1835 how adult weight normally increases in proportion to height squared , the index provides a measure of body weight , independent of stature , allowing us to compare the weight of short and tall people . 
In 1972 , an American scientist , Ancel Keys , working in the area of human nutrition , public health , and epidemiology , renamed it the BMI after finding that its values also correlated with body fat mass as derived from skin-fold or body-density measurements . 
However , recent findings have cast doubt on the BMI &apos;s value . 
For example , although the BMI is associated with fat mass in obese people , there is little or no association with that of normal or underweight individuals . 
At any given BMI score , fat mass varies widely , and other variables , such as gender or age , further distort findings , with greater increases in fat mass per BMI unit seen in women and in the elderly . 
Although the BMI is an unscientific way to characterize a person &apos;s nutritional status , it is nonetheless used as a measure of total body fat mass in medical practice and epidemiological studies , not least because it is easy to calculate and document regularly in personal health records . 
Typically , doctors use it to categorize patients as &quot; underweight &quot; ( a BMI value below 18.5 ) , &quot; normal weight &quot; ( 18.5-25 ) , &quot; overweight &quot; ( 25-30 ) , or &quot; obese &quot; ( above 30 ) . 
This categorization is determined by data drawn from the general population and based on the assumption that there is a higher risk of metabolic or cardiovascular disease found at the high end ( and sometimes the low end ) of the BMI scale . 
Although recent studies suggest that high BMI scores do not necessarily increase risk of death , doctors find the BMI categories a useful basis for prevention and treatment . 
Such usage , however , has serious limitations . 
Because the index is calculated from two biological measures ( weight and height ) , the resulting score has no biological meaning in itself . 
Thus , studies of the genetics of obesity that are based on a relationship between certain genetic markers and the BMI are also meaningless . 
In fact , the use of the BMI is likely to obscure our understanding of genetic effects on body weight . 
This is because body weight is the sum of our organs and body tissues ; and each organ or body part has its own regulatory ( and thus partly genetic ) basis . 
We can understand more about organ and tissue masses , for example , or fatty infiltrations in individual organs like the liver and pancreas , by focusing on the nature of each body component , rather than by relying on an overall body score . 
Indeed , the regulation of body weight overall is determined by the sum of the specific regulatory outcomes affecting individual body components . 
Because individual body components are inter-related , control of body weight seems to occur in the relationships between tissues and organs , rather than within individual components . 
Adjusting weight by height squared is also likely to yield a different outcome for different organs . 
Although many body components do scale to height by a power close to two , others do not . 
The brain , bone , and mineral mass scale to height by a power greater than two ; while fat mass scales to height by a power of 1.8-2.6 , depending on the population being studied and the means of measurement used . 
In short , body weight and body fat mass may not scale to height by the same power . 
This power may vary by population ; and short and tall subjects with equal BMI scores , from the same population , may have a different body composition . 
Further evidence supporting the use of body-composition analysis , rather than the BMI , comes from the metabolic heterogeneity observed within each BMI category . 
For example , a subgroup of normal-weight subjects may have low subcutaneous fat mass but high visceral fat mass ( &quot; thin on the outside and fat on the inside &quot; ) . 
Despite their normal BMI , metabolically obese individuals - who may comprise as much as 24 % of a normal-weight population - may be insulin-resistant and suffer increased cardio-metabolic risks . 
Likewise , around half of overweight subjects , and 15-45 % of obese subjects , appear to have a favorable metabolic profile ( that is , no metabolic complications , inflammation , dyslipidaemia , or hypertension ) . 
At a BMI above 30 , these subjects are deemed &quot; metabolically healthy obese . &quot; 
Like obese patients suffering from cardio-metabolic risks ( the &quot; metabolically abnormal obese &quot; ) , they have high visceral and subcutaneous fat mass , though metabolically healthy obese patients sometimes have excessive body fat but lower fat infiltration in the liver and in skeletal muscle . 
But the differences between the metabolically healthy obese and the metabolically abnormal obese are inconsistent . 
And , though age , sex , ethnicity , waist circumference , physical activity , smoking , and alcohol consumption all correlate with metabolic phenotypes , the BMI is unable to distinguish between the two groups . 
It would be unfair to say that the BMI has no clinical value ; it can be a useful indicator of nutritional health in patients , and help doctors make day-to-day decisions about whom they should treat . 
But one must turn to body-composition measurements for any serious epidemiological and etiological studies on obesity .
