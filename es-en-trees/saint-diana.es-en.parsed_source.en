Saint Diana ? 
PRINCETON - Ten years after her death , Princess Diana still has star power . 
The media are filled with tributes and retrospectives , and all over the world , the public seems to be avidly soaking it up . 
Has Diana become a new kind of saint , and if so , what does that tell us ? 
I encountered the cult of Diana in 2004 , when I was in Hyde Park on the day the Queen opened the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain . 
I found myself among a group of middle-aged women wearing jackets and hats covered with badges . 
They looked like football fanatics , except that the badges bore Diana &apos;s face , not David Beckham &apos;s . 
I started chatting with them , and learned that their clothing , handbags , and shoes were patterned after those that Diana had worn . 
Some had a &quot; Diana room &quot; in their homes , filled with memorabilia of the princess . 
Their lives , it seemed , now revolved around a woman who had been dead for seven years . 
The Italian sculptor Luigi Biaggi offered his view of this phenomenon with a statue of Diana in a pose and robes suggestive of the Virgin Mary . 
Celebrities , his work was saying , have replaced religious figures . 
Margaret Evans , a British researcher , studied tributes people left for Diana after her death and found that some referred to her as a saint , or an angel , and a few compared her directly with Jesus . 
Bizarre theories sprung up about Diana &apos;s death including claims that the British secret service murdered her because she was a threat to the throne , or that she is living happily with her new love , Dodi Fayed , having staged the entire event to get away from the glare of publicity . 
Then , as befits the death of a quasi-divine figure , a prophesy of her death was discovered in the words of the singer / songwriter Morrissey on the Smiths &quot; album &quot; The Queen is Dead . &quot; 
From a rational perspective , this idolizing of Diana is as absurd as any cult . 
Granted , she used her prominence to promote worthwhile causes . 
She championed the sick and marginalized , and her work for a ban on landmines , while sometimes ridiculed as politically naïve , drew worldwide attention to the issue . 
Whether that would have led , without her death , to the Ottawa treaty banning landmines is impossible to tell . 
Even now , many nations , including the United States , Russia , China , Israel , and Iran , have not signed the treaty . 
Of course , there was often a disturbing incongruity between Diana &apos;s commitment to the poor and sick , and the extravagant lifestyle she led . 
In contrast to the British royal family &apos;s stiffness and reserve , she showed herself to be a princess who was also a normal human being , more like the rest of us . 
As she went through a messy divorce triggered by an unfaithful husband , millions of women shared her pain . 
In an era before reality television shows , Diana &apos;s life was reality television . 
The constant media focus enabled people to feel that they knew her , and so they followed and cared intensely about her ups and downs , as if she were a member of their own family . 
To otherwise mundane lives , a sense of involvement with Diana added excitement and glamor . 
Earl Spencer urged us to resist the temptation to canonize his sister . 
In his funeral speech - the most interesting of all the Diana eulogies - he said that turning her into a saint was incompatible with appreciating her &quot; mischievous sense of humor . &quot; 
Nevertheless , he went on to attribute some saint-like qualities to her , especially her &quot; almost childlike &quot; desire to do good for others . 
In trying to account for the way British newspapers sneered at her good intentions , he said : &quot; My own and only explanation is that genuine goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum . &quot; 
That remark may have been a bitter payback for the role Spencer believed the media , and the paparazzi who worked for them , played in Diana &apos;s death , but it was not without truth . 
Some people use cynicism to evade moral responsibility . 
If you can convince yourself that everyone behaves selfishly , then why try to be a better person ? 
A person with a naïve but sincere desire to do good threatens that protective shell , and one way to blunt the threat is to sneer . 
Diana might have had a better life in the US , where people and the media are more ready to accept good intentions at face value . 
What effect did Diana &apos;s life and death have on the millions who admired and loved her ? 
After her death , tens of millions grieved and many wrote letters and sent checks to the Diana , Princess of Wales Memorial Fund , which has a website called www.theworkcontinues.org . 
Perhaps that was inevitable . 
While a single person can arouse our emotions , such feelings tend to be temporary and rarely produce a lasting change in our lives . 
Or perhaps those who identified so strongly with Diana somehow imagined that they shared in her good deeds , and that they need not do anything more .
