Mexico &apos;s Second Revolution 
MEXICO CITY - Mexico , a stagnant and violence-plagued country in recent years , finally began to overcome its malaise in 2013 , thanks to an activist president and a coalition of political parties determined to move the country forward . 
But , alongside substantive changes , there is considerable uncertainty and hyperbole . 
It could hardly be otherwise . 
The situation resembles that of 20 years ago - almost to the day . 
When the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) among Mexico , Canada , and the United States entered into force on January 1 , 1994 , it seemed that Mexico was poised for a true takeoff . 
But a series of events - the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas , the assassinations of a presidential candidate and the incoming president &apos;s chief aide , and the collapse of the currency - shook Mexico that year , underscoring the depth of the challenges it faced . 
NAFTA brought with it a spectacular increase in Mexican exports , as well as a dramatic shift in their composition . 
But it proved to be a great disappointment in terms of foreign investment inflows and economic growth , which has averaged 2.6 % per year over the last two decades - slower than Peru , Chile , Colombia , Brazil , and Uruguay . 
As a result , Mexico &apos;s income gap with the US and Canada has barely narrowed . 
Thus , President Enrique Pe単a Nieto &apos;s task since taking office one year ago has been to ensure that the promise of major change in Mexico finally translates into sustained economic growth , improved living standards , and faster convergence with the US and Canada . 
While both the foreign and local press refer generally to &quot; reforms , &quot; or lump together education , labor , financial , fiscal , energy , telecommunications , and political reforms , there are significant differences among them . 
Some consider all of the changes that have taken place in Mexico this year to be equally important . 
Others have mused that Pe単a Nieto &apos;s administration sometimes seems intent on announcing reforms , regardless of their content , the time necessary to implement them , or their actual impact on Mexican society . 
In fact , a clear distinction can be drawn between two subsets of legislative achievements : those that , while not meaningless , are incomplete , superficial , or essentially maintain the status quo , and those that will change Mexico ( if all goes well ) . 
The changes in how teachers are evaluated and their labor rights ( wrongly described as an education reform ) , together with changes to tax and telecommunications legislation , belong to the first category ; energy and political reforms belong to the second . 
Energy reform opens up electricity generation and oil exploration , extraction , and refining to private foreign or domestic investment through licenses , concessions , production sharing , or profit sharing . 
The oil workers &quot; union has been banished from the board of directors of Pemex , the national oil company , and new contracts for shale oil and gas , together with deep-water prospecting and drilling , will be signed with a government agency , not with Pemex . 
Once the myriad legal and political obstacles are cleared , Mexico will be able to increase oil and gas production , drive down the price of electricity , and stimulate growth in an otherwise lethargic economy . 
One hopes that 12 years of obstruction by Pe単a Nieto &apos;s Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) will not mean that these reforms are too little , too late . 
The second crucial reform is political . 
For the first time since the early 1920 &quot; s , Mexican legislators and mayors will be allowed to seek reelection to consecutive terms . 
While no panacea , reelection is one of the most important instruments of accountability in a democracy , and Mexico has been deprived of it for nearly a century . 
The same is true of ballot initiatives , referenda , and independent candidacies , all of which were non-existent until the recent reform . 
For the first time since Mexico left behind 70 years of authoritarian rule , the country has a political and electoral framework that resembles those found in all modern democracies . 
Both reforms are incomplete and may not be sufficient to jump-start the economy and mobilize a singularly passive civil society . 
Because Pemex , unlike the Brazilian and Colombian state-owned oil companies , will not be listed on the New York or Mexico City stock exchanges , internal reform will be postponed or half-baked . 
Moreover , it will be years before any oil actually begins to flow from the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico , and how much shale oil and gas actually exists in northeastern Mexico is unknown . 
Nor is it certain that foreign investment ( or tourism ) will increase , given the country &apos;s current levels of violence , crime , and human-rights violations . 
Likewise , restrictions and ambiguities continue to plague the institutional arrangements sought by the framers of the country &apos;s political and electoral reforms . 
Reelection is permitted only for candidates nominated by the same party for which they originally ran , and the enabling legislation for independent candidates , ballot initiatives , and referenda remains unclear . 
Most important , the government appears to be backtracking on a commitment to allow a binding referendum on the opening of the oil sector and other &quot; transcendent &quot; issues . 
Its reluctance is understandable , because voters are evenly divided on the issue , and no one will invest a cent in Mexican oil or gas if the recently approved constitutional amendment on Pemex can be overturned in 2015 , as the opposition claims will happen . 
But curtailing democracy in order to modernize the energy sector is not a good idea . 
Finally , skepticism persists with regard to the Mexican economy &apos;s capacity to achieve sustainable 4-5 % annual economic growth - the bare minimum needed to ensure long-term prosperity . 
Deficient education , infrastructure , security , and courts , together with endemic corruption and scant entrepreneurial dynamism , militate against excessive optimism . 
NAFTA 20 years ago , and Pe単a Nieto &apos;s reforms now , are necessary but insufficient conditions for progress . 
More is needed , and what is needed is not necessarily attainable .
