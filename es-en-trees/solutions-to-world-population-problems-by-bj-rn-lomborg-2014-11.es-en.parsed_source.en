The Population Challenge 
BRISBANE - When people think of the world &apos;s &quot; population problem , &quot; they often focus on rapid demographic growth in parts of the developing world . 
Though we cannot afford to ignore the fact that , according to United Nations estimates , there will be 2.4 billion more mouths to feed worldwide by mid-century , another population problem also merits serious attention : large pockets of demographic decline . 
In developed countries , not only is the share of elderly people rising ; birth rates are too low to maintain the size of the total population . 
While the life expectancy gains that are driving this shift should be celebrated , their problematic consequences - forcing a declining number of working-age people to support an increasing number of retired people - must be addressed . 
Meanwhile , in developing countries , the opposite is happening , with too many young people lacking employment - or , at least , high-quality , full-time employment . 
To be sure , it will not be very long before these countries begin to confront the problems of aging and shrinking populations , as well . 
In fact , these contrasting trends present an ideal opportunity for global demographic rebalancing . 
By easing restrictions on migration , developed countries could bolster their dwindling workforces with young people from developing countries . 
These migrant workers &quot; taxes would help developed countries fund services for the elderly , and their remittances would help their home countries . 
This approach has enormous potential benefits . 
Indeed , a modest 3 % increase in the developed-country workforce would provide a larger economic boost than removing all remaining trade barriers . 
Moreover , every dollar invested in this initiative would produce nearly $ 50 in returns , making it an exceptionally effective use of limited resources . 
These impressive figures emerged from a comprehensive analysis conducted by a team of top economists tasked by my think tank , the Copenhagen Consensus Center , with assessing possible population-related targets , in order to identify the best global investments . 
( Additional teams considered issues in 18 other areas . ) 
Such objective , empirically-based analysis should guide ongoing efforts - involving the UN , national governments , NGOs , and other actors - to establish the next global development agenda , which will be launched next year . 
Indeed , it is the only way to ensure that the poorest people get the best deal , and that governments get the biggest bang for their buck . 
While the current agenda - centered on the so-called Millennium Development Goals - has produced significant successes , its failure to emphasize such cost-benefit analyses has prevented practitioners from fully optimizing limited resources . 
Another advantage to this kind of analysis is that it can highlight future risks associated with longer-term trends like global population growth . 
This is important , as a rising population may be an even bigger problem than was previously thought . 
A new study argues that there is now a 70 % chance that the world population will not peak this century , and an 80 % chance that it will reach 9.6-12.3 billion people by 2100 . 
Sub-Saharan Africa - persistently the poorest region - will be the main engine of demographic growth . 
Fortunately , there is a cost-effective way to slow down this engine : improve women &apos;s access to modern contraception . 
Providing contraception for the 215 million women worldwide - a large share of them in Africa - who would like to avoid pregnancy would cost about $ 3.6 billion annually . 
This is a pittance , when one considers the massive payoff . 
Each year , there would be an estimated 640,000 fewer newborn deaths , 150,000 fewer maternal deaths , and 600,000 fewer children losing their mothers - yielding economic benefits of roughly $ 145 billion . 
And there is more good news . 
Better access to contraception would enable mothers to spend more time raising - and educating - the children that they do have . 
Fewer kids also means that a larger share of the population would be working , boosting the economy by an estimated $ 288 billion annually for a generation . 
Altogether , each dollar spent on family-planning programs yields a whopping $ 120 in benefits . 
Of course , simply distributing contraception would not be enough . 
People in poor countries - especially in high-fertility African countries , which have only 18 % of the world &apos;s population but produce 38 % of its newborns - would also benefit considerably from educational initiatives centered on health and family planning . 
There is no silver bullet for sustainable development . 
Improving the lot of the world &apos;s poorest people as much as possible means navigating powerful forces , entrenched habits , and , most important , severe financial , temporal , and human-capital constraints . 
For that reason , objective , data-driven analysis is the best guide .
