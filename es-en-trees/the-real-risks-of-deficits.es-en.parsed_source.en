The Real Risks of Deficits 
Deficits are back - with a vengeance . 
America &apos;s government budget deficit now stands at $ 455 billion , 4.1 % of GDP . 
Two years ago , the US predicted budget surpluses as far as the eye could see . 
Although marginally less bloated than the US deficit , other rich countries are drowning in red ink . 
The European Commission predicts that the French government deficit will reach 3.7 % of GDP this year , with Germany &apos;s widening to 3.4 %  - both figures well beyond the deficit cap ( 3 % of GDP ) set by the Euro-zone &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact . 
By running a deficit , a country increases its national debt and imposes burdens on future generations . 
Politicians naturally prefer to hide how wealth is shifted between generations . 
Their priority is paying for immediate problems , and for today &apos;s promised benefits . 
The accountants who compute government deficits try to keep politicians from fooling us into accepting the benefits they offer without understanding something of the future cost . 
But what these accountants do not provide is a way to judge when deficits are justifiable and when they are not . 
Deficits raise not only immediate political issues , but also issues of distributive justice between generations , and of intergenerational risk sharing . 
No generation should be forced to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation . 
Whether or not deficits treat future generations properly depends on how a government &apos;s systems for taxation and expenditure are designed . 
Those who advocate running deficits often portray them as necessary to fix an economy in which confidence is draining away . 
Following Keynes , they argue that running deficits will restore confidence before a recession or depression can take hold . 
It is like putting a patient on Prozac before he becomes suicidal . 
But such arguments , although valid at times , have their limits . 
Japan &apos;s public deficits spawned a national debt of 140 % of annual GDP , without producing any economic resurgence . 
Indeed , today &apos;s budget deficits reflect long-term problems that are not what Keynesian theory envisions . 
So discussions about deficits should be recast in terms of the really long-term intergenerational issues that matter . 
The issues are subtle , because they hinge on what future governments may do . 
In the past , some governments , when faced with large national debts , effectively &quot; inflated them away . &quot; 
They thus shifted the debt burden away from the next generation and onto investors who did not bail out of the bond market at the first sign of rising prices , or who postponed buying a house when inflation would have wiped out the real value of their mortgage debt . 
Governments could decide to act this way again , especially if national debts grow bigger . 
A resurgence of substantial inflation may seem unthinkable in today &apos;s environment , but remember that even a relatively modest 6 % annual inflation rate cuts the real value of a nation &apos;s debt in half in just 11 years . 
Continued public opposition to a gradual increase in inflation is not guaranteed . 
Some future politicians may succeed again in planting the idea that inflation , being stimulative , is good for the economy . 
But in addition to today &apos;s officially measured government deficits , there are also other looming obligations caused by a demographic change ( declining birth rates ) and the prospect of huge social-welfare payments in the future . 
The scale of these obligations is monumental . 
In their 2003 report , the Trustees of the US Social Security Administration Trust Funds estimate that maintaining the Social Security System &apos;s solvency for the next 75 years will require an amount whose present value is $ 3.5 trillion , nearly equal to today &apos;s total US government debt ( $ 3.9 trillion ) . 
The Trustees of the US Medicare Trust Funds ( providing medical services to the retired ) estimate that their unfunded obligations have a present value of $ 5.9 trillion - 50 % larger than America &apos;s official publicly-held national debt . 
The potential for budgetary shortfall with social security and health care is even worse in Europe and Japan , due to their more troublesome demographics . 
Moreover , unlike official national debt , social-welfare obligations are not fixed in currency . 
Instead , they are promises of a certain standard of living ( including the value of medical services ) , corrected for inflation . 
No government can thus &quot; inflate them away . &quot; 
But this does not mean that pensions and other welfare obligations are entirely fixed . 
What it does mean is that the problem is political . 
Pensioners are among the most powerful lobbies in a democracy , and politicians are loath to confront them on so fundamental an issue . 
Still , we need to face squarely the intergenerational issues at the core of today &apos;s economic dilemmas . 
Our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a &quot; generational accounting &quot; that assures that economic risk is spread systematically across generations . 
What this means is that pension and tax institutions must be designed to take better account of the changing circumstances facing different generations , rather than make fixed promises - which most likely cannot be kept , anyway - of a certain payout in the future . 
For example , when demographic trends or persistent economic hardships impose undue social-welfare burdens on working people , benefits to pensioners should be automatically modified by raising the retirement age and / or adjusting benefits . 
Such adjustments will probably happen anyway in the coming decades , but only after a long lag and with many inequities in the process . 
What we need is the right system from the beginning , so that we can rationally manage risks that span several generations . 
Can these issues be addressed now , when the economic slowdown in most advanced countries makes most politicians focus on short-term fixes ? 
Hard times , like the Great Depression , have been occasions for fundamental changes . 
With proper leadership ( which unfortunately seems in short supply ) , today &apos;s milder hardships could provide an opportunity for public discussion of better ways of intergenerational risk sharing .
