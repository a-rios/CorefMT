Silent Momentum on Climate Change 
NAIROBI - The last two years have been a roller coaster ride in respect to securing a new global treaty to combat climate change . 
Some even despair that the window for action is closing fast . 
But giving up is not an option . 
The latest round of climate negotiations , held last month in Cancún , Mexico , put the world &apos;s efforts on climate change back on track - albeit at a pace and on a scale that will undoubtedly leave many onlookers frustrated . 
President Felipe Calderón &apos;s government in Mexico and the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention deserve credit for gains in a range of important areas , including forestry , a new Green Fund to assist developing nations , and the anchoring of the emission-reduction pledges made at the December 2009 climate-change conference in Copenhagen . 
But , as the UN Environment Program and climate modelers made clear in the run-up to the Cancún meeting , a significant emissions gap exists between what is being promised by countries and what is needed to keep the rise in global temperature below two degrees Celsius , let alone move towards the 1.5-degree threshold needed to protect low-lying island states . 
Despite some gains , that gap - which , under the most optimistic scenario , amounts to the combined emissions of all the world &apos;s cars , buses , and trucks - remains firmly in place post-Cancún . 
Indeed , no one should underestimate the magnitude of the challenge now facing South Africa , the host of next year &apos;s talks , in terms of midwifing a new legally binding agreement to bridge this gap and securing the finance needed to bring the Green Fund into operation . 
Yet , while the official summit in Cancún struggled to a conclusion , an unofficial one being held a few minutes away also concluded . 
This parallel summit brought together progressive heads of state , regional and local government , business , and civil society , and underscored just how far and how fast some sectors of society will make the transition to a low-carbon future and build the green and clean-tech economies of the twenty-first century . 
Calderón &apos;s policies echo this momentum : by some estimates , he is transforming his country into the world &apos;s fastest-growing wind-power market . 
Moreover , Mexico will also phase out old , inefficient light bulbs by 2014 . 
And it has just retired 850,000 inefficient household refrigerators in favor of modern , energy-efficient models , with millions more earmarked over the coming years . 
Mexican homeowners who install energy-saving systems such as solar water heaters are becoming eligible for lower-rate &quot; green mortgages . &quot; 
Uruguay , for example , announced a strategy to generate half its electricity from renewable sources by 2015 . 
Sixty regional and local governments , responsible for 15 % of global greenhouse-gas emissions , are also taking action . 
Québec and São Paolo , to cite just two examples , are aiming for cuts of 20 % below 1990 levels by 2020 . 
Big companies , from banks to airlines , are contributing as well . 
The US retailer Wal-Mart , for example , plans to cut emissions equivalent to 3.8 million cars , in part by implementing energy-efficiency measures at its Chinese stores . 
Indeed , the world is witnessing an extraordinary mobilization of national-level projects and policies that are shifting economies onto a low-carbon path . 
In Kenya , a new feed-in tariff is triggering an expansion of wind and geothermal power . 
Indonesia is not only addressing deforestation , but will begin phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies for private cars next month . 
Many countries and companies are forging ahead , signaling a determination not to be held hostage by the slowest at the official negotiating table . 
All this may lead some to wonder why time-consuming international negotiations and UN climate summits are needed at all . 
But the fact is that this groundswell has in large part been catalyzed by the existing targets , timetables , and innovative mechanisms of the UN climate treaties , and not least by the momentum generated around the often-criticized 2009 Copenhagen summit . 
This momentum would continue to grow with a new global treaty that not only brings certainty to carbon markets and triggers accelerated investments in clean-tech industries , but that also ensures that more vulnerable countries are not marginalized . 
The challenge today is to unite these goals in a mutually reinforcing way . 
Only then will the world have a fighting chance to keep the global temperature rise in this century under two degrees , build resilience against a changed climate , and truly transform the energy structures of the past - and thus the development prospects for six billion people in the future .
