Europe &apos;s Political Stress Tests 
PRINCETON - In recent years , the European Union - or , more accurately , the powerful countries of northern Europe - has been subjecting its weaker members to social and political &quot; stress tests &quot; in the name of fiscal rectitude . 
As a result , southern Europe and parts of Eastern Europe have become a kind of political laboratory , with experiments producing strikingly varied - and increasingly unpredictable - outcomes in different countries . 
At the last EU summit , Luxembourg &apos;s prime minister , Jean-Claude Juncker , even suggested that the risk of a &quot; social revolution &quot; should not be excluded . 
While that outcome remains unlikely , it is increasingly clear that many European countries - and the EU as a whole - need to renegotiate their basic social contracts . 
But European elites , preoccupied with short-term fixes , have not considered the long-term need for such revisions - to their own detriment . 
Indeed , despite significant variations by country , one trend is becoming increasingly apparent across the EU : voters , regardless of their political orientation , are ejecting at the first opportunity leaders who implement austerity . 
But , beyond this overwhelming opposition to austerity , countries &quot; experiences vary widely . 
Greece has seen the rise of an overtly fascist party , Golden Dawn , which proudly celebrates the legacy of former dictator Ioannis Metaxas . 
Although Golden Dawn has existed for roughly two decades , only in the last year did it gain enough support to enter parliament . 
Moreover , its poll numbers continue to climb . 
Golden Dawn &apos;s success does not reflect a deep-seated desire among Greeks to return to authoritarianism . 
The party has simply stepped in where the Greek state - long plagued by inefficiency and corruption - has retreated , providing basic welfare and other services to desperate citizens , while engaging in unprecedented violence against people who are or look like immigrants . 
One way that Golden Dawn attempts to embody the state is by having party members out on the streets as vigilantes . 
Austerity has similarly sharpened a long-standing crisis of statehood and political legitimacy in Italy , reflected in the rise of a new anti-establishment party , the Five Star Movement , which claims to transcend the traditional left-right political spectrum . 
Indeed , the movement lacks clear policy objectives , instead capitalizing on popular disgust with Italy &apos;s political elites - a sentiment that led directly to the last election &apos;s failure to produce a clear winner . 
The sense of revulsion is acute : Many of the Five Star Movement &apos;s supportershope to transfer control of Italy &apos;s government to citizen-representatives , whose every move would be digitally monitored to preclude corruption . 
Some countries &quot; electorates initially backed austerity , but none has re-authorized it . 
In Spain , for example , voters understood the implications of supporting the ruling Popular Party , making it one of the only southern states where the government had some kind of mandate to implement tough austerity . 
But the mutually reinforcing recession and debt crisis that Spain now faces have reinvigorated Catalonia &apos;s long-standing secessionist movement ; austerity has transformed a chronic , though manageable , problem into an acute existential question . 
Similarly , Portugal &apos;s center-right Social Democratic Party has pushed a tough pro-austerity line , including tax hikes and spending cuts , since coming to power in 2011 . 
But new measures introduced last month have driven an increasingly frustrated population - which , until recently , had endured painful austerity with little of the public outcry seen elsewhere in southern Europe - to the streets to demand a general election two years ahead of schedule . 
Political and social turmoil across southern Europe holds several lessons for austerity &apos;s proponents - especially for Germany . 
First and foremost , the dogma that solid public finances - and , more broadly , a functioning state - can be achieved only through painful austerity is an illusion . 
When forced to choose between their societies and their clientele , politicians may well decide that allowing social tensions to rise - even to dangerous levels - is better than sacrificing their own power bases . 
In fact , when Germany embarked a decade ago on a reform program featuring major cuts to the welfare state and a more flexible labor market , it broke the rules of the eurozone &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact . 
Public spending had to rise before it could fall , in order to provide some slack while renegotiating parts of the social contract . 
The second lesson from southern Europe is that muddling through is unlikely to work . 
Building the needed support for a new social contract will require an appeal to fairness , not just to fiscal rectitude . 
And a mechanism to authorize the new deal - such as a grand coalition actually empowered by elections ( not just reluctant support by major parties for technocratic leaders like Italy &apos;s Mario Monti ) - is essential . 
Alternatively , citizens could try to lead efforts to re-negotiate their countries &quot; constitutional arrangements . 
Iceland , for example , has embarked on an unprecedented experiment in crafting a bottom-up , &quot; crowd-sourced &quot; constitution . 
Similarly , albeit less radically , ordinary citizens comprise two-thirds of Ireland &apos;s Constitutional Convention . 
If southern eurozone countries followed the route of forging a new social deal , they would have to ensure that it ultimately intersects with the paths of the northern European members . 
While all eurozone countries do not have to converge on a single model , their interdependence means that a pan-European social and economic settlement is needed . 
European leaders must move beyond the increasingly implausible mantra of &quot; belt-tightening today ; full bellies tomorrow , &quot; and recognize that , at its core , the euro crisis is a political crisis . 
Rather than focus on quick policy fixes , Europe &apos;s leaders need to pursue long-term solutions . 
And that includes new social contracts .
