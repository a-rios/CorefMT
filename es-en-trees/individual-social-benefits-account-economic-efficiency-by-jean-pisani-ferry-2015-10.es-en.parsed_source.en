Social Benefits in the Age of Uber 
PARIS - When it comes to compensation , the company you work for often matters more than how good you are at what you do . 
In 2013 , the average employee of Goldman Sachs , the investment bank , earned $ 383,000 - much higher than what the best-performing employee in most firms can hope to take home . 
Pay differences across companies are considerable . 
Research by Jason Furman , US President Barack Obama &apos;s top economic adviser , and Peter Orszag , Obama &apos;s former budget director , has found that rising pay differentials are the prime cause of widening US wage inequality in recent decades . 
They account for a larger part of the rise in overall income inequality than wage differences within companies or capital income . 
At the other end of the spectrum , many labor-force participants are on temporary contracts , work for small firms , or are self-employed . 
Some combine different jobs at the same time . 
If , as expected by many , the so-called sharing economy develops , their number is bound to grow . 
These workers do not benefit from job security and generally earn much less . 
Emerging countries offer the example of blatant inequality between employees in the formal sector - companies like Petrobras in Brazil and Infosys in India - and those who work in the informal economy . 
But even in advanced economies , where social protection is broad in scope , access to benefits is far from equal . 
Employees of large , profitable firms tend to enjoy better health-care coverage , more generous pensions , and easier access to training . 
Moreover , some benefits - for example , parental leave - are conditional on seniority within a company . 
These are disturbing facts . 
Talent and effort should be rewarded , but two people of equal capabilities and dedication should not be treated differently just because one happens to be an insider , with a secure job in a big , successful company . 
Such differences are questionable not only in terms of fairness ; they are also economically inefficient , because they tend to limit labor mobility across firms and sectors . 
Employees may think twice before leaving a company if they are set to lose valuable perks as a consequence . 
This prevents potentially positive matching of the skills needed by employers and the available supply of them . 
It also makes hiring first-class talent excessively difficult for small companies . 
Public policy should not prevent successful companies from paying more and offering better working conditions . 
But it should ensure that all participants in the labor force , whatever their status , enjoy equal access to essential benefits ; and it should aim at minimizing the losses that impede mobility across firms , sectors , and types of employment . 
Obama &apos;s health-care reform was an important step in this regard . 
But social-welfare reforms should go much further . 
For fairness as well as for efficiency reasons , rights and benefits should be attached to individuals , not to companies or employment status , and should be fully portable across sectors and jobs . 
To attune its social-welfare system to a changing economy and reduce inequality among individuals , France is currently considering a system of so-called Individual Activity Accounts ( IAAs ) . 
My colleague Selma Mahfouz chaired a committee that prepared a blueprint for such a system . 
Put simply , every new labor-force entrant would be equipped with a lifelong individual account , thereby accumulating points in the same way airline travelers accumulate miles . 
They would earn them by working in both the private and public sector . 
Physically strenuous jobs would yield more points than office jobs . 
Pro bono community service would also generate points - perhaps more than paid jobs . 
Points earned could be spent on lifelong education and professional training , which would thus become independent from employment status . 
Every person could decide to draw on her IAA to prepare for , or when making , a job change . 
Other financing could also be mobilized toward the same end . 
For example , an employee could decide to shorten the duration of his unemployment benefits and invest the corresponding points to benefit from better education opportunities . 
But financing education should not be the only purpose . 
Points could also be used to help finance volunteerism or care for elderly family members . 
Points earned through hard toil could be spent on retiring earlier . 
Many more examples of partial fungibility could be imagined . 
Such a system would have three additional benefits . 
First , it would help improve access to information . 
Employees nowadays are often lost in the complexity of the various social benefits to which they are entitled . 
The creation of IAAs and the adoption of a single unit of account would go a long way toward making things simpler , especially if all relevant individual information is available to users via a single smartphone app . 
Second , IAAs would empower employees , especially the least skilled , who often perceive themselves as being in a state of subjection . 
Together with information , the possibility to invest their social benefits , rather than only consuming them , would strengthen their autonomy and freedom of choice . 
Finally , the same accounts could serve as vehicles for public policy . 
For example , early school-leavers could be endowed with points for later use in professional training . 
More broadly , instead of assisting people only when social risks materialize , public policy could support individuals throughout their working life , by adopting a more effective bespoke approach that fits peoples &quot; needs better than coarsely tailored schemes . 
This may sound utopian ; in a way , it is . 
But at a time when every digital service becomes more and more personalized , why should social policy remain confined to the philosophy and solutions of the twentieth century ?
