The Democrats &quot; Line in the Sand 
BERKELEY - Ever since the 1928 work of Frank Ramsey , economists have accepted the utilitarian argument that a good economy is one in which returns on investment are not too great a multiple - less than three - of the rate of per capita economic growth . 
An economy in which profits from investment are high relative to the growth rate is an economy that is under-saving and under-investing . 
This idea has also given rise to a very strong presumption that if an economy as a whole is under-saving and under-investing , the government ought to help to correct this problem by running surpluses , not make it worse by running deficits that drain the pool of private savings available to fund investment . 
This is why most economists are deficit hawks . 
Of course , governments need to run deficits in depressions in order to stimulate demand and stem rising unemployment . 
Moreover , a lot of emergency government spending on current items is really best seen as national savings and investment . 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt could have made no better investment for the future of America and the world than to wage total war against Adolf Hitler . 
Likewise , Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton ought to have recognized in the 1990 &quot; s that something like a Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe to help with the transition from communism would have been an excellent investment for the world &apos;s future . 
But the rule is that governments should run surpluses and not deficits , so various American presidents &quot; economic advisers have been advocates of aiming for budget surpluses except in times of slack demand and threatening depression . 
This was certainly true of Eisenhower &apos;s , Nixon &apos;s , and Ford &apos;s economic advisors , and of George H.W. Bush &apos;s and Bill Clinton &apos;s economic advisers . 
It was true of Reagan &apos;s economic advisers as well . 
Some of Reagan &apos;s advisers sincerely did not believe that the tax cuts of the early 1980 &quot; s would generate the large deficits that they did ( Beryl Sprinkel and Lawrence Kudlow come to mind ) . 
Others , like Martin Feldstein and Murray Weidenbaum , understood the consequences of the Reagan tax cuts and were bitter bureaucratic opponents , even if they did not speak out publicly . 
In fact , since WWII , only George W. Bush &apos;s economic advisers have broken with this consensus . 
A few have done so because they are making careers as party-line Republicans , so their priority is to tell Republican politicians what they want to hear ( Josh Bolton and Mitch Daniels come to mind here ) . 
As for the rest , their reasons for supporting the Bush administration &apos;s savings-draining policies remain mysterious . 
It is not as though they were angling for lifetime White House cafeteria privileges , or that having said &quot; yes &quot; to George W. Bush will open any doors for them in the future . 
But their failings do pose a dilemma for Democratic deficit-hawk economists trying to determine what good economic policies would be should Barack Obama become president . 
Those of us who served in the Clinton administration and worked hard to put America &apos;s finances in order and turn deficits into surpluses are keenly aware that , after eight years of the George W. Bush administration , things look worse than when we started back in 1993 . 
All of our work was undone by our successors in their quest to win the class war by making America &apos;s income distribution more unequal . 
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link , and it seems pointless to work to strengthen the Democratic links of the chain of fiscal advice when the Republican links are not just weak but absent . 
Political advisers to future Democratic administrations may argue that the only way to tie the Republicans &quot; hands and keep them from launching another wealth-polarizing offensive is to widen the deficit enough that even they are scared of it . 
They might be right . 
The surplus-creating fiscal policies established by Robert Rubin and company in the Clinton administration would have been very good for America had the Clinton administration been followed by a normal successor . 
That &apos;s a hard question , and I don &apos;t know the answer . 
There is , however , one fiscal principle that must be respected . 
Fiscal deficits so large that they put the debt-to-GDP ratio on an explosive upward trend do not merely act as a drag on long-term economic growth ; they also create the possibility that at any moment the economy might face an immediate macroeconomic and financial disaster . 
A more hawkish fiscal stance may no longer be possible in future Democratic administrations , and might not be good policy if it were , given the likely complexion of successor administrations . 
Stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio is thus the line in the sand that must not be crossed .
