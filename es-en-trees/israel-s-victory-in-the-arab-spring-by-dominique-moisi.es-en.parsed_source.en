The Arab Spring &apos;s Unlikely Winner 
PARIS - The war in Iraq - which led in 2003 to the fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime - had one clear winner : Iran . 
The United States-led military intervention resulted in the weakening of the Middle East &apos;s Sunni regimes , America &apos;s traditional allies , and the strengthening of America &apos;s principal foe in the region , the Islamic Republic . 
Ten years later , we may be witnessing yet another ironic outcome in the region : At least for the time being , Israel seems to be the only clear winner of the &quot; Arab Spring &quot; revolutions . 
Most Israelis would strongly object to this interpretation . 
Only a few days ago , Israel &apos;s Iron Dome missile-defense system intercepted a rocket fired from Sinai that was aimed at the port of Eilat . 
In contrast to the past , no Israeli border is now secure , especially the long frontier with Egypt . 
No implicit alliance can be taken for granted . 
All scenarios are open . 
Can Israel remain an oasis of stability , security , modernity , and economic growth in such a volatile environment ? 
The answer , of course , is no . 
Israel may be tempted to regard itself as some kind of latter-day Noah &apos;s ark , but it is not . 
Tel Aviv has become a cross between San Francisco , Singapore , and SÃ£o Paulo , but it is still less than 300 kilometers from Damascus . 
For the pessimists ( or realists , depending on your perspective ) , Israel must remain on maximum alert to minimize the risks that it faces . 
Above all , many Israelis ( if not most ) believe that this is no time to be imaginative and daring . 
The resumption of the peace process with the Palestinian Authority can be only a fig leaf . 
Israel simply cannot ignore the Americans in the way that the Egyptian army has as it massacres its Islamist opponents . 
But a very different reading of the current situation is possible . 
What started as a revolution in the eighteenth-century meaning of the term is becoming a reproduction of the religious wars that ravaged Europe from 1524 to 1648 , pitting Catholics and Protestants against each other in the same way that Sunnis and Shia are pitted against each other today . 
( In Egypt , however , we are seeing simply the return of a military police state . ) 
One may disagree with this Euro-centric interpretation , but what is clear is that the Muslim Middle East will be too preoccupied with internecine struggle to worry about the Palestinians or the existence of Israel . 
War with Jews or Christians has necessarily taken a back seat ( except where , as in Egypt and Syria , Christian minorities are perceived to be allied with the regime ) . 
In some cases , there is explicit cooperation with Israel . 
Because it is fighting for its own survival in a highly challenging environment , the Jordanian regime needs Israel &apos;s security collaboration . 
Indeed , Israeli and Jordanian forces are now working together to secure their respective borders against infiltration by jihadists from Iraq or Syria , while Egypt and Israel now share the same objective in Sinai . 
So the paradox of the Arab revolutions is that they have contributed to Israel &apos;s integration as a strategic partner ( for some countries ) in the region . 
At this point , more Arab lives have been lost in Syria &apos;s civil war alone than in all of the Arab-Israeli wars combined . 
Of course , one should not draw the wrong conclusions from this . 
Israel may have become , more than ever , a key strategic partner for some Arab regimes , or a de facto ally against Iran ( as it is for Saudi Arabia ) . 
Nor does it mean that Israel can do whatever it wants , whenever and wherever it wants . 
On the contrary , the Israeli government should not use the region &apos;s turmoil as justification for doing nothing to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians . 
Current conditions , though admittedly confusing , can be seen as opening a window of opportunity - a moment to consider making serious sacrifices for the sake of long-term survival . 
Israel should be addressing the Arab world in the following terms : &quot; You may not like me , and you may never like me , but I am not - and never should have been - your first concern . 
Now it is clear that you have other priorities to worry about . &quot; 
The Arab quagmire may not be creating conditions for peace and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians . 
Arabs cannot be at war with themselves and with Israel at the same time . 
The chaotic events unfolding in the Middle East will - and should - change the approach and perceptions of the protagonists . 
Short-term considerations will not suffice . 
Israeli leaders must adjust their long-term strategic thinking to the new Middle East that ultimately emerges from the current disarray . 
That means not exploiting today &apos;s opportunity to build more settlements on Palestinian land , or to expand existing ones , as Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s government appears determined to do . 
Israel may well be the current winner in the Arab Spring ; but , if it is wise , it will leave the spoils of victory on the ground .
