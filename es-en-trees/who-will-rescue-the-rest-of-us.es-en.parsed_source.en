Who Will Rescue the Rest of Us ? 
SYDNEY - The rescue of the 33 Chilean miners , from what was feared would be their tomb , gave the world something to cheer about . 
Hope has not , after all , become a redundant virtue in the twenty-first century . 
But , looking around us today , there do not seem to be many reasons for optimism elsewhere . 
The world lurches towards a currency war , or even towards trade protectionism , threatening to destroy jobs and growth . 
America &apos;s recovery from recession is anemic and largely jobless . 
Nor does a global solution to the challenge of climate change appear any closer . 
A few weeks of rain in Australia has emboldened those who think that global warming is a gigantic hoax perpetrated by the United Nations or conspiring scientists or maybe men from Mars . 
The war in Afghanistan bleeds more lives and treasure into the inhospitable terrain of that sad land , with little immediate chance of whatever might constitute sufficient success to allow America and its allies to quit . 
And the problems of Pakistan fester next door . 
In Palestine , Israeli colonies continue to grow with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ignoring Washington &apos;s efforts to secure traction for the peace process . 
Europeans continue to look inward , obsessed with their own problems of declining competitiveness and how to pay for entitlements that they have come to regard as theirs by right . 
With the gap between the world &apos;s rich and poor increasing , the impoverished South seeks a home or a job in the developed North . 
Legal and illegal migration triggers far-right hostility in countries that customarily brag about their commitment to civil liberties . 
So , as Lenin once asked , what is to be done ? 
The world obviously needs political leadership of the highest quality to see us through . 
We need the sort of courage that was the hallmark of Margaret Thatcher . 
We need Bill Clinton &apos;s extraordinary ability to spin a political narrative that enabled voters to identify their own interests with his goals . 
We require Helmut Kohl &apos;s understanding of the need to identify the big decisions in politics , and to get those decisions right . 
We need leaders with sufficient mastery of detail , like China &apos;s last premier Zhu Rongji , who can not only tell us how they will get us from A to Z , but can actually lead us from A to B. 
Looking around , leaders like this seem to be an extinct species . 
Their ability to act is limited by their political environment . 
The best example is US President Barack Obama , on whom so many hopes rested - probably too many for any one leader . 
Obama inherited messy and expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and an economy in meltdown . 
His attempts to revive the economy have inevitably driven up the deficit . 
Now Obama faces defeat in the mid-term elections at the hands of Republicans whose past policies created many of the problems that weigh him down today . 
They want less government , lower taxes , and a smaller deficit , a combination to be achieved seemingly without pain . 
This nonsense on stilts is articulated by some zany candidates who enjoy the support of the Tea Party , a reference not to the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland , which would be fitting , but to the Bostonians who rebelled against colonial Britain &apos;s imposition of taxes in the eighteenth century . 
The rest of the world needs a strong , self-confident , and decisive America . 
In Europe , meanwhile , many of our problems are exemplified by what is happening in France , where President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s attempt to recognize demographic and fiscal reality by raising the retirement age from 60 to 62 provoked a wave of strikes and stormy protests from workers and students . 
Is there not something deeply depressing about 18-year-olds demonstrating about the retirement age ? 
How on earth did they acquire such a statist and conservative mind-set ? 
Perhaps , then , Asia is the answer . 
Perhaps the Singapore-based strategist Kishore Mahbubani is correct to write off the West and tell us that the future lies in his own continent . 
The evidence on that point is mixed . 
India is a glorious democracy with an economically literate government and pockets of real economic achievement . 
If those problems were sorted out , India &apos;s growth rate would outstrip China &apos;s . 
And what of the booming Middle Kingdom ? 
In Brussels the other day , Premier Wen Jiabao scolded European leaders for pressing for the renminbi &apos;s revaluation . 
Did they not understand , he argued , that this would lead to factory closures and social turbulence in China ? 
Elsewhere , of course , this sort of turmoil has democratic safety valves . 
It is more than odd to argue that the rest of the world has to cope with a built-in advantage for China &apos;s exporters because its authoritarian political system cannot cope with any change . 
No wonder the impressive premier is thought to favor some political loosening . 
From East to West , politics seems to be operating in a manner that is , to be diplomatic , sub-optimal . 
Then again , maybe we &apos;re lucky that things aren &apos;t worse . 
The Chilean miners survived against the odds , so perhaps the rest of us will somehow get by as well .
