Iran &apos;s Nuclear Quandary 
LOS ANGELES - When the United States and its allies resume talks over Iran &apos;s nuclear program on November 7-8 , the vexing task of crafting Iran &apos;s recent proposal into an enduring agreement will begin in earnest . 
There are many obstacles to an agreement , but among the least examined is the legacy of nuclear-disarmament efforts involving Libya and North Korea . 
For the US , North Korea illustrates how a poor but ambitious country developed the bomb by gaming talks and gaining time . 
For Iran , Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s 2003 relinquishment of Libya &apos;s weapons of mass destruction demonstrates how a regime , still considered a bête noire by the international community even after normalization of diplomatic relations , arguably forfeited its survival in 2011 by forgoing the chance to build a nuclear deterrent . 
Digging further into each case illuminates the challenges faced by Iran and its international interlocutors . 
What makes the North Korea precedent particularly troubling is how much Iran has mimicked the regime in Pyongyang . 
This naturally prompts questions about whether Iran is using the current round of negotiations as a façade for an ongoing effort to develop nuclear weapons . 
Consider parallels ten years apart . 
In June 1993 , following talks with the US and a threat to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , North Korea allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct limited &quot; safeguards activities . &quot; 
Then , in October 1994 , the US and North Korea entered into the Agreed Framework to freeze North Korea &apos;s nuclear program . 
Similarly , in December 2003 , after hiding construction of the Natanz uranium-enrichment facility and other plants from the IAEA , Iran agreed to sign - but not ratify - the so-called Additional Protocol , allowing broader application of IAEA safeguards . 
Then , in November 2004 , in negotiations with European representatives , Iran agreed to suspend nuclear enrichment . 
Neither agreement lasted long . 
In March 1996 , the IAEA reported that North Korea was not complying with efforts to verify plutonium held at the Yongbyon nuclear facility . 
On October 9 , 2006 , North Korea detonated its first nuclear weapon , and the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1718 calling on the country to abandon its program and re-join international denuclearization talks . 
Since then , North Korea has responded to incremental tightening of international sanctions with two more nuclear tests , the latest this year under the new leadership of Kim Jong-un . 
Likewise , in January 2006 , following the collapse of negotiations with European emissaries , Iran broke the IAEA seals on the Natanz facility &apos;s equipment and storage areas . 
The following month , the IAEA reported the Islamic Republic to the Security Council for its failure to be forthright about its nuclear program . 
Since then , Iran has responded to incremental tightening of international sanctions by building more centrifuges . 
The question now is whether the North Korea-Iran parallel stops with Iran &apos;s new president , Hassan Rouhani . 
The Libyan legacy confronts Iran with its own conundrum . 
Like Iran , Qaddafi &apos;s Libya suffered economic and political isolation for many years during which it attempted to advance a WMD program . 
By the late 1990 &quot; s , however , it had had enough . 
British and American negotiators secretly met with Libyan counterparts to resolve the case of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , and other terrorism issues . 
In the quid pro quo that followed , Qaddafi agreed to eliminate his nascent nuclear program in exchange for an end to pariah status . 
This was coupled with a critical demand : no deal without America &apos;s commitment to eschew regime change . 
On December 19 , 2003 , Libya formally renounced all WMD efforts . 
Eight years later , pinned down by a US Predator drone and French airstrikes , Qaddafi met his demise . 
Without a nuclear deterrent , his regime was helpless when the US reneged on the deal - a lesson that has not been lost on North Korea . 
Given this history , Iran has a strong incentive to retain at least a nuclear-breakout option ( which would mean completing all but the final steps to weaponization ) . 
Of course , Iran &apos;s leaders may believe that economic isolation is the greatest danger to the regime . 
But what happened in Libya has made them fear that Qaddafi &apos;s fate could be theirs , too , without an adequate deterrent . 
Indeed , commenting on Qaddafi &apos;s plight in 2011 , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said , &quot; &#91; T &#93; his gentleman wrapped up all his nuclear facilities , packed them on a ship and delivered them to the West and said , &quot; Take them ! &quot; 
Look where we are , and in what position they are now . &quot; 
But today , two years later , Iran must look again at where it is . 
As long as crippling economic sanctions remain in place , the government will be unable to have its yellowcake and eat it , too . 
Allowing Iran to retain some low-grade enrichment capacity would be a plausible concession - and one that would allow the country &apos;s leaders to save face - but only if linked to Iran &apos;s unfettered disclosure of all nuclear activities to the IAEA and confirmed cessation of any capability that contributes to weaponization . 
And , given the stakes , any international agreement with Iran must come with an assured response to cheating , including military action . 
They could follow North Korea by sacrificing economic prosperity for nuclear breakout , and hope that US and Israeli talk of &quot; all options &quot; being on the table to stop their efforts is a bluff ; or they could pursue economic prosperity by forgoing a nuclear-weapons capacity , and hope that a Libya-style revolt does not envelope the country and doom the regime to a fate like that of Qaddafi . 
It is not an easy choice , but it is one that Iran &apos;s leaders cannot postpone for much longer .
