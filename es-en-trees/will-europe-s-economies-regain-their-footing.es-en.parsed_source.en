Will Europe &apos;s Economies Regain Their Footing ? 
STOCKHOLM - What will Europe &apos;s growth trajectory look like after the financial crisis ? 
For some Europeans , still nervous that their economies and banking systems might collapse , this is a little like asking a passenger on the Titanic what they plan to do when they arrive in New York . 
But it is a crucial question to ask , especially when Europe has been facing so much outside pressure from the likes of the United States and the International Monetary Fund to focus on short-term Keynesian stimulus policies . 
True , things are pretty ugly right now . 
Europe &apos;s income is projected to fall a staggering 4 % this year . 
Unemployment will soon be in double digits throughout most of the Continent , with Spanish and Latvian unemployment on track to exceed 20 % . 
Europe &apos;s banking system remains sickly , even though many national governments have gone to great lengths to hide their banks &quot; woes . 
Yet , ugly or not , the downturn will eventually end . 
Yes , there is still a real risk of hitting an iceberg , beginning perhaps with a default in the Baltics , with panic first spreading to Austria and some Nordic countries . 
But , for now , a complete meltdown seems distinctly less likely than gradual stabilization followed by a tepid recovery , with soaring debt levels and lingering high unemployment . 
It is not a pretty picture . 
Some commentators have savaged Europe &apos;s policymakers for not orchestrating as aggressive a fiscal and monetary policy as their US counterparts have . 
Why else is Europe suffering a deeper recession than America , they complain , when everyone agrees that the US was the epicenter of the global financial meltdown ? 
But these critics seem to presume that Europe will come out of the crisis in far worse shape than the US , and it is too early to make that judgment . 
An epic , financial-crisis-driven recession , such as the one we are still experiencing , is not a one-year event . 
So policymakers &quot; responses cannot be evaluated by short-term measures , either . 
It is just as important to ask what happens over the next five years as over the next six months , and the jury is still very much out on that . 
America &apos;s hyper-aggressive fiscal response means a faster rise in government debt , while its hyper-expansive monetary policy means that an exit strategy to mop up all the excess liquidity will be difficult to execute . 
Government spending in the US has risen in short order from 18 % to 28 % of income , while the US Federal Reserve has effectively tripled its balance sheet . 
Europe &apos;s more tempered approach , while magnifying short-term risks , could pay off in the long run , especially if global interest rates rise , making it far more painful to carry oversized debt loads . 
The real question is not whether Europe is using sufficiently aggressive Keynesian stimulus , but whether Europe will resume its economic reform efforts as the crisis abates . 
If Europe continues to make its labor markets more flexible , its financial market regulation more genuinely pan-European , and remains open to trade , trend growth can pick up again in the wake of the crisis . 
If European countries look inward , however , with Germany pushing its consumers to buy German cars , the French government forcing car companies to keep unproductive factories open , etc . , one can expect a decade of stagnation . 
Admittedly , the past year has not been a proud one for policy reform in Europe . 
Recessions have never proven an easy time for European leaders to push forward with reforms . 
Matters were not helped when the Czech government lost a confidence vote midway through its six-month presidency of the European Union , leaving a lame duck European Commission . 
The shadow of forthcoming elections in Germany , together with concern over whether Irish voters will ratify the Lisbon treaty ( giving Europe a badly needed new constitution ) , has conspired to impede reform momentum . 
Yet Europe &apos;s many strengths , including strong democratic governments and sound legal institutions , are often under-rated as long-term competitive strengths in today &apos;s globalized economy . 
The recent recession has presented challenges , but European leaders were right to avoid becoming intoxicated with short-term Keynesian policies , especially where these are inimical to addressing Europe &apos;s long-term challenges . 
If reform resumes , there is no reason why Europe should not enjoy a decade of per capita income growth at least as high as that of the US . 
Moreover , with growing concerns about the sustainability of US fiscal policy , the euro has a huge opportunity to play a significantly larger role as a reserve currency . 
One shudders to think what will happen if Europe does not pull out of its current funk . 
Certainly , Europe would lose traction as a badly needed counterweight to the US in world economic policy . 
Europeans may not mind this right now ( one sees more Obama t-shirts in Europe than in the US ) , but they might not be so happy if a George Bush III comes along . 
Fortunately , Europeans will probably not wait so long to start moving ahead again .
