Iraq : More than an American Problem 
Many people around the world are indulging in what the Germans call &quot; schadenfreude &quot; : pleasure at the suffering of others . 
The pleasure appears to be derived from the suffering the United States is enduring after four years of efforts to stabilize Iraq . 
On one level , that reaction is predictable . 
Resentment of the wealthy and powerful is hardly new . 
But the US in the last few years has compounded this reaction by what it has done and how it has done it . 
For some , it was the decision to go to war in Iraq ; for others , it was Guant√°namo and the perceived double standards of American justice . 
For still others , it was the lack of sustained effort to bring about peace between Israelis and Palestinians or US opposition to the International Criminal Court and to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change . 
The result is that anti-Americanism has grown in both reach and intensity . 
Still , any satisfaction at the problems the US is undergoing in Iraq is shortsighted and sure to be short-lived . 
Every government in the world has a stake in the future of Iraq and the stability of the Middle East . 
Terrorism bred in Iraq will not stay there . 
Those men and women who learn to make and detonate roadside bombs on the streets of Baghdad will ply their trade elsewhere in the region and beyond . 
Terrorists who have tasted success in Iraq will increasingly turn on others . 
Expressions of anti-Americanism will provide no protection or immunity to governments or individuals who for good reason are not prepared to endorse the terrorists &quot; radical agendas . 
War in Iraq will only exacerbate frictions between the country &apos;s Sunni minority and Shia majority , and such frictions could well be replicated elsewhere where Sunnis and Shia live side by side . 
Even if not , the flight of millions of Sunni refugees will weaken the foundations of neighboring states , including Jordan . 
Continued fighting in Iraq could also lead to regional war . 
Turkey , for example , is poised to attack the Kurdish enclave in Iraq &apos;s north . 
It is also possible that resistance to Iranian efforts to dominate Iraq could lead to a wider conflict that draws in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and others . 
Even without such a wider conflict , what happens in Iraq will affect the price of oil . 
Iraq is producing oil at levels below what it produced under Saddam Hussein , and has the potential to double or even triple output . 
Doing so would require significant investment , which in turn would require international confidence in Iraq &apos;s future stability . 
Absent such confidence , Iraq &apos;s oil output will not approach its potential , which will only widen the gap between global supply and demand . 
Costly oil is a tax on the poor in developing countries and a source of inflation for the developed countries . 
It also provides resources to governments that in many cases are promoting foreign policies that are contrary to the interests of most other countries . 
The rest of the world also has a stake in how the US emerges from Iraq . 
There is a real danger that a widely-perceived failure in Iraq could lead to a serious weakening of American domestic political support for an active international role , particularly difficult but necessary deployments of military force . 
The alternative to a world shaped by a strong , confident , and engaged US is not likely to be a world that is peaceful , prosperous , and free . 
In strategic terms , no other country or group of countries has the capacity to replace the US . 
The alternative to a US-led global order is disorder , in which terrorism , nuclear proliferation , and economic protectionism are increasingly the norm . 
This suggests , first , that governments should avoid public comments describing the American presence as an occupation or as lacking legitimacy , lest they make it more likely that the US departs Iraq entirely and leaves the country and its people to a terrible fate . 
Second , countries should support Iraq &apos;s government , despite its shortcomings . 
This means extending diplomatic recognition , including opening and maintaining embassies . 
There is also a moral and practical case for doing more to ease the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons . 
Third , terrorism needs to be checked . 
None of Iraq &apos;s neighbors , including Iran , would benefit from sectarian conflict that grows into a regional war . 
Finally , governments should consider contributing troops to help establish order , train the Iraqi police and military , and help Iraq guard its borders . 
As the US inevitably reduces its role , others should be prepared to step up , lest Iraq &apos;s government falls and the Iraqi state fails . 
The reality is that Iraq &apos;s future is not assured even if these and similar measures are taken . 
Still , there is a big difference between an Iraq that struggles and one that implodes ; between an Iraq that contributes to global energy security rather than undermining it ; between a civil war and a regional war . 
It may be too late for the US to succeed in Iraq , but it is not too late for others to increase the odds that the US does not fail .
