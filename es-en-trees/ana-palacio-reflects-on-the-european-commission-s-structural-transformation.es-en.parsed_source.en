Europe &apos;s Juncker Revolution 
MADRID - Before his appointment as EU Commission President , Jean-Claude Juncker was pilloried as an old-school federalist who would do little to alter the status quo . 
But the new structure that he has imposed on the Commission implies a radical overhaul of how things are done in Brussels . 
Up to now , a focus on who has been appointed to what post - in particular , the appointment of the relatively inexperienced Federica Mogherini as EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy - has overshadowed the Commission &apos;s structural transformation . 
But individual commissioners are far less important than the trends that have caused the Commission to shift its priorities from enlargement and the internal market toward energy and monetary union . 
One such trend is Europeans &quot; growing skepticism toward integration , exemplified in May &apos;s European Parliament election . 
With newer European Union members backsliding - Romania on the rule of law , Bulgaria in corruption , and Hungary on democratic norms under Viktor Orbán &apos;s government - now is the time , or so it seems , to focus on existing members . 
Reinforcing this shift is Turkey &apos;s drift toward authoritarianism , which is undermining the viability of its candidacy for EU membership . 
As for Ukraine , recent gestures of solidarity , such as the signing of an association agreement , are unlikely to develop into anything substantial in the foreseeable future . 
In downgrading EU enlargement as a formal policy priority , the Commission is preparing itself to take other important steps . 
The upheaval among Europe &apos;s southern and eastern neighbors may well bring about a long-overdue revamping of the EU &apos;s Neighborhood Policy . 
And , in pursuit of other avenues for expanding the EU &apos;s reach , European leaders might reinvigorate the European Economic Area . 
Another policy area that has lost its centrality is the internal market - a notable decision , given that it has been the centerpiece of the European project since the Commission was created in 1958 . 
The internal market &apos;s four pillars - the free movement of goods , services , capital , and people - have underpinned broader EU measures , in areas like foreign policy and justice and home affairs , and will now be subsumed under new policy labels , from economy and financial affairs to the digital agenda . 
This move away from the internal market can be explained partly by member governments &quot; aversion to more EU-level legislation . 
Though complaints about the &quot; bloated &quot; acquis communitaire ( the body of EU law ) are often unfounded , the EU legislative process is not without its shortcomings , as recent attempts at harmonization clearly demonstrate . 
For example , for the EU-wide statutory audit that was completed in April , the European Parliament agreed to a revised directive and new regulation that should have been directly applicable in all 28 member countries . 
But , in more than 20 cases , member states were given discretion over its implementation and interpretation . 
The new Commission will attempt to change this by focusing on rule implementation and oversight , rather than creation . 
This effort will be coordinated by representatives in seven newly established vice-presidential positions , and spearheaded by the first vice president to have a portfolio focused on &quot; better regulation . &quot; 
To be sure , easing regulatory burdens is a longstanding leitmotif of the EU . 
Though the last two Commissions , led by José Manuel Barroso , espoused a commitment to rationalizing , clarifying , and compiling rules , little concrete action has been taken . 
Juncker &apos;s changes , however , may portend genuine progress on this front , as well as toward monetary and energy union . 
Indeed , the new Commission &apos;s structure suggests that Juncker hopes to enhance its role in guiding the European Monetary Union and related policies , control over which largely rested with the European Council and EU member governments ( especially Germany ) during the crisis . 
Similarly , a new vice president has been introduced for energy , which has been reframed as &quot; energy union . &quot; 
The lack of progress on this front during the last two Commissions was rooted mainly in Germany &apos;s Russian modernization project , which has shaped its approach to energy security . 
For its part , France has been reluctant to build an interconnected European grid , owing to its heavy reliance on nuclear energy . 
Given Russian behavior in Ukraine , however , EU leaders have been rethinking their approach . 
In this context , the Commission &apos;s new structure - not to mention the fact that the new European Council president , former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk , has long sought an energy union - may well push the policy forward . 
Though it is impossible to understand fully the implications of the Commission &apos;s new structure at this early stage , some of its institutional ramifications are already emerging . 
Beyond inciting a kind of tug-of-war with the European Council , the Commission &apos;s shift away from lawmaking will alter the European Parliament &apos;s role , which it has forged over the last five years on the back of the Commission &apos;s active legislative agenda . 
With little authority to initiate legislation , the Parliament , too , will have no choice but to pivot toward oversight . 
Precisely how all of this all plays out in the coming months and years will determine whether the European project progresses or stagnates . 
Perhaps observers should be paying a little less attention to the &quot; who &quot; and a bit more to the &quot; what . &quot;
