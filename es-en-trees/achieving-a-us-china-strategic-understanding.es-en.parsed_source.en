Achieving a US-China Strategic Understanding 
ALBERTA - Relations between the United States and China have been at a low point in recent months . 
Tensions over US arms sales to Taiwan , President Barack Obama &apos;s meeting with the Dalai Lama , disputes over the value of China &apos;s currency , a supposed snub of Obama by Chinese leaders at December &apos;s Copenhagen climate summit , and the rupture between Google and China have all played a role . 
But President Hu Jintao &apos;s visit to Washington for the nuclear security summit , which followed a phone conversation between him and Obama , has set the stage for a serious and calm exchange of views on a range of bilateral and international issues , including Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
This calming of the diplomatic atmosphere was helped considerably by US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner delaying his 
Geithner even made a quick stop in Beijing on April 8 to meet Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan , prompting reports that China may let the renminbi float more flexibly . 
Nevertheless , before anyone concludes that US-China ties are warming up , it is worth noting that the two countries have starkly different views on how to manage their relationship . 
Take the recent Obama-Hu telephone conversation . 
Reports in the US following the hour-long exchange praised it as a turning point in bilateral relations , and headlines emphasized that Obama worked on Hu to achieve a common stand in sanctioning Iran over its pursuit of nuclear weapons . 
Instead , they stressed Hu &apos;s demand that the US side &quot; properly handle &quot; the Taiwan and Tibet issues , which represent China &apos;s &quot; core interests . &quot; 
There was not even a mention that the two leaders discussed Iran , other than one line saying that they exchanged views on international issues of common concern . 
Such discrepancies reflect a broader perception gap . 
On the American side , the emerging consensus is that the Obama administration began its term committed to working closely with China on a range of issues . 
It took extra steps in not being openly critical of China &apos;s currency policy , launched the high-profile US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue , delayed a meeting with the Dalai Lama prior to Obama &apos;s China trip , and showed substantial patience with China &apos;s concerns at the Copenhagen conference . 
But that conciliatory approach , which brought down on Obama domestic criticism , did not seem to be appreciated by the Chinese . 
Instead , China displayed sharp anger at the US arms sale to Taiwan , something that has been going on for decades , and to Obama &apos;s low-key meeting with the Dalai Lama . 
Many in the Obama administration now ask : what is the point of being nice when there are no obvious benefits ? 
On the Chinese side , the initial accommodating approach by Obama , although met with a level of caution and skepticism , was perceived as an inevitable reflection of China &apos;s rise and more equal status with the US . 
After all , many argue , China continues to buy US treasury bonds and now shoulders the largest amount of US debt , thus financing whatever the Americans are doing , from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to health-care reform at home . 
China has played a vital role in getting the global economy onto a speedier path to recovery , thanks to its effective stimulus package . 
China is also expected to help resolve the nuclear standoffs with North Korea and Iran , two counties that are hostile to the US but less of a threat to China . 
So China &apos;s leaders felt a sense of betrayal when Obama , shortly after his positive visit to Beijing , went ahead with the arms sales to Taiwan and the meeting with the Dalai Lama . 
Many mainstream , liberal-minded Chinese academics complain that there is no fresh US approach to China . 
The problem is not a lack of communication channels . 
Both countries have interacted with each other for almost four decades . 
There are no language problems , few cultural barriers , and plenty of conferences and personal correspondence . 
We have seen elegant op-eds written on both sides , more or less articulating how one side is right and the other side wrong . 
The end result ? 
They talk past each other rather than with each other . 
The fundamental issue in today &apos;s US-China relations is the strategic visions that both governments are developing to cope with China &apos;s rise . 
Americans tend to think that what is good for America must be good for the world . 
Chinese leaders , for their part , tend to believe that nothing matters much if it is not good for China in the first place . 
Both countries must acknowledge that they have their own domestic and foreign policy priorities . 
Some may be shared ; some not . 
Others may conflict . 
To accommodate and bridge their different interests , the US and China need to engage in more than just frank discussions . 
Tangible strategic concessions from both sides must be made in order to promote cooperation and avoid confrontation .
