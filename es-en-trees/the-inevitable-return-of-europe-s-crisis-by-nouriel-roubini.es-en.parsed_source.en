The Eurozone &apos;s Delayed Reckoning 
NEW YORK - The risks facing the eurozone have been reduced since the summer , when a Greek exit looked imminent and borrowing costs for Spain and Italy reached new and unsustainable heights . 
Several factors account for the reduction in risks . 
For starters , the European Central Bank &apos;s &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; program has been incredibly effective : interest-rate spreads for Spain and Italy have fallen by about 250 basis points , even before a single euro has been spent to purchase government bonds . 
The introduction of the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , which provides another â‚¬ 500 billion ( $ 650 billion ) to be used to backstop banks and sovereigns , has also helped , as has European leaders &quot; recognition that a monetary union alone is unstable and incomplete , requiring deeper banking , fiscal , economic , and political integration . 
But , perhaps most important , Germany &apos;s attitude toward the eurozone in general , and Greece in particular , has changed . 
German officials now understand that , given extensive trade and financial links , a disorderly eurozone hurts not just the periphery but the core . 
They have stopped making public statements about a possible Greek exit , and just supported a third bailout package for the country . 
As long as Spain and Italy remain vulnerable , a Greek blowup could spark severe contagion before Germany &apos;s election next year , jeopardizing Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s chances of winning another term . 
So Germany will continue to finance Greece for the time being . 
Nonetheless , the eurozone periphery shows little sign of recovery : GDP continues to shrink , owing to ongoing fiscal austerity , the euro &apos;s excessive strength , a severe credit crunch underpinned by banks &quot; shortage of capital , and depressed business and consumer confidence . 
Moreover , recession on the periphery is now spreading to the eurozone core , with French output contracting and even Germany stalling as growth in its two main export markets is either falling ( the rest of the eurozone ) or slowing ( China and elsewhere in Asia ) . 
Moreover , balkanization of economic activity , banking systems , and public-debt markets continues , as foreign investors flee the eurozone periphery and seek safety in the core . 
Private and public debt levels are high and possibly unsustainable . 
After all , the loss of competitiveness that led to large external deficits remains largely unaddressed , while adverse demographic trends , weak productivity gains , and slow implementation of structural reforms depress potential growth . 
To be sure , there has been some progress in the eurozone periphery in the last few years : fiscal deficits have been reduced , and some countries are now running primary budget surpluses ( the fiscal balance excluding interest payments ) . 
Likewise , competitiveness losses have been partly reversed as wages have lagged productivity growth , thus reducing unit labor costs , and some structural reforms are ongoing . 
But , in the short run , austerity , lower wages , and reforms are recessionary , while the adjustment process in the eurozone has been asymmetric and recessionary / deflationary . 
The countries that were spending more than their incomes have been forced to spend less and save more , thereby reducing their trade deficits ; but countries like Germany , which were over-saving and running external surpluses , have not been forced to adjust by increasing domestic demand , so their trade surpluses have remained large . 
Meanwhile , the monetary union remains an unstable disequilibrium : either the eurozone moves toward fuller integration ( capped by political union to provide democratic legitimacy to the loss of national sovereignty on banking , fiscal , and economic affairs ) , or it will undergo disunion , dis-integration , fragmentation , and eventual breakup . 
And , while European Union leaders have issued proposals for a banking and fiscal union , now Germany is pushing back . 
German leaders fear that the risk-sharing elements of deeper integration ( the ESM &apos;s recapitalization of banks , a common resolution fund for insolvent banks , eurozone-wide deposit insurance , greater EU fiscal authority , and debt mutualization ) imply a politically unacceptable transfer union whereby Germany and the core unilaterally and permanently subsidize the periphery . 
Germany thus believes that the periphery &apos;s problems are not the result of the absence of a banking or fiscal union ; rather , on the German view , large fiscal deficits and debt reflect low potential growth and loss of competitiveness due to the lack of structural reforms . 
Of course , Germany fails to recognize that successful monetary unions like the United States have a full banking union with significant risk-sharing elements , and a fiscal union whereby idiosyncratic shocks to specific states &quot; output are absorbed by the federal budget . 
The US is also a large transfer union , in which richer states permanently subsidize the poorer ones . 
At the same time , while proposals for a banking , fiscal , and political union are being mooted , there is little discussion of how to restore growth in the short run . 
Europeans are willing to tighten their belts , but they need to see a light at the end of the tunnel in the form of income and job growth . 
If recessions deepen , the social and political backlash against austerity will become overwhelming : strikes , riots , violence , demonstrations , the rise of extremist political parties , and the collapse of weak governments . 
And , to stabilize debt / GDP ratios , the denominator must start rising ; otherwise , debt levels will become unsustainable , despite all efforts to reduce deficits . 
The tail risks of a Greek exit from the eurozone or a massive loss of market access in Italy and Spain have been reduced for 2013 . 
But the fundamental crisis of the eurozone has not been resolved , and another year of muddling through could revive these risks in a more virulent form in 2014 and beyond . 
Unfortunately , the eurozone crisis is likely to remain with us for years to come , sustaining the likelihood of coercive debt restructurings and eurozone exits .
