Europe &apos;s Flawed Banking Union 
PARIS - The European Union is now the proud owner of a Nobel Peace Prize . 
When the choice alighted on Barack Obama three years ago , the Norwegian Nobel Committee was criticized for honoring someone whose achievements were still to come . 
The Committee took that criticism to heart , and this time decorated an institution with a proud past , but a clouded future . 
The eurozone is distinct from the EU of course , but it is the Union &apos;s most ambitious undertaking to date , and it is still struggling to equip itself with the structures needed to bolster a currency union . 
A common fiscal policy remains a distant dream , as does a genuine political union . 
But Europe &apos;s policymakers claim to be making progress toward a so-called &quot; banking union , &quot; which means collective banking supervision , rather than a merger of banks themselves . 
In September , the European Commission announced a plan to make the European Central Bank the supervisor of all 6,000 of Europe &apos;s banks . 
The reaction among national politicians , central banks , and banks themselves was not universally favorable . 
The Germans want the ECB to focus only on large systemic banks , and leave smaller savings banks ( like those that invested heavily in subprime mortgages ) to national authorities . 
The United Kingdom and Sweden argue that they cannot be made subservient to a central bank of which they are , at best , semi-detached members . 
The case for a pan-European supervisor is widely accepted , especially as the European Banking Authority ( the EU &apos;s banking regulator ) proved feeble in carrying out financial stress tests : the first tests were so weak that even Spain &apos;s now-bankrupt savings banks could pass with flying colors . 
Europe must break the vicious circle linking distressed sovereign borrowers with banks that are obliged , or at least encouraged , to buy their bonds , which in turn provide the funding for bank rescues . 
But the method chosen by the Commission to implement a banking union is fatally flawed . 
Moreover , according to a leaked opinion from the EU Council &apos;s chief legal adviser , the proposed reform is illegal , because , according to the Financial Times ( which received the leak ) , it goes &quot; beyond the powers permitted under law to change governance rules at the European Central Bank . &quot; 
Throughout the crisis , European leaders have tried to respond to the gaps in the monetary union without proposing a new treaty , because they fear that any new treaty proposing more centralization of authority in Brussels would be rejected , either by national parliaments or by voters in a referendum . 
So they have tried to proceed by intergovernmental agreement , or by using existing treaty provisions . 
In the case of the banking union , they plan to use Article 127 ( 6 ) of the Lisbon Treaty which allows the European Council to grant authority to the ECB to perform specific tasks concerning &quot; policies relating to the prudential supervision &quot; of certain financial institutions in the Union . 
That is a thin legal basis for establishing a pan-European supervisor with direct responsibility for individual institutions , and it was clearly not intended for that purpose . 
Indeed , Germany agreed to the wording only on the understanding that the ECB could not be a direct supervisor . 
The consequences of choosing this inadequate , if expedient , route are serious . 
For starters , the existing treaty cannot be used to create a single European resolution authority , leaving an awkward interface between the ECB and national authorities . 
Nor can it be used to establish a European deposit protection scheme , which is arguably the most urgent requirement , to stem the outflow of deposits from southern European banks . 
The use of the Lisbon Treaty clause means that the ECB must be given these additional responsibilities . 
But it is impossible to create a separate bank-supervision entity within the ECB , as has been done in France , for example , with the Prudential Control Authority , or in the UK with the new Prudential Regulatory Authority , which has its own board and accountability arrangements within the Bank of England . 
The importance of these structures is that they insulate the central bank &apos;s monetary-policy independence from corruption by the tighter accountability requirements that inevitably come with banking supervision . 
Because supervisors &quot; decisions affect individuals &quot; property rights - and their actions or omissions can put taxpayers on the hook to bail out banks - governments , parliaments , and the courts are bound to hold the watchdogs on a tight leash . 
That is why Germany &apos;s Bundesbank , which always guarded its monetary-policy independence so assiduously , has once again found itself in the rejectionist camp , expressing severe doubts about the route that the Commission plans to take . 
This time , they are right . 
There are other serious issues , too . 
According to the Commission &apos;s model , the European Banking Authority will remain in place , and is charged with producing a single rulebook for all 27 EU member states . 
The Commission is trying to find ways to protect the rights of the non-eurozone countries . 
Non-Europeans , in particular , may find the entire topic impenetrably abstruse . 
Indeed , the devices that the EU is adopting are designed specifically to avoid having to consult them . 
The proposed construction of a banking union reveals this fundamental flaw at the heart of the European project today . 
It is difficult to be optimistic about the success of an initiative built on such flimsy legal foundations , and lacking democratic legitimacy . 
Europe &apos;s banks and their customers deserve better .
