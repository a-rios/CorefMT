A Separated Peace 
MADRID - Back in 1996 , Binyamin Netanyahu won a general election by mobilizing large constituencies against then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres &apos;s alleged intention to &quot; divide Jerusalem . &quot; 
Nearly two decades later , Netanyahu remains committed to old , vacuous slogans about a &quot; united Jerusalem &quot; - a conviction that could , yet again , unravel the Israel-Palestine peace process . 
As US Secretary of State John Kerry prepares to present a framework agreement for a conclusive round of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations , Netanyahu &apos;s hardline position on Jerusalem is simply a non-starter . 
In a last-ditch effort to improve the proposal &apos;s chances of success , US President Barack Obama - who has largely avoided taking a proactive role in the peace process during his second term - met with Netanyahu at the White House to urge him to moderate his position . 
But changing Netanyahu &apos;s mind will not be easy - not least because of the domestic political pressure that he faces . 
Since Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War , the country &apos;s political class has championed the city as Israel &apos;s &quot; united eternal capital &quot; - a vision that they remain unwilling to abandon . 
The problem is that no serious negotiation with the Palestinians could accommodate this position . 
Jerusalem &apos;s Arab population - which already accounts for more than 40 % of the total - is growing by 3.5 % annually , compared to 1.5 % among Israelis . 
Once this sizeable swath of voters begins participating in municipal elections - which they have so far avoided , lest they be viewed as legitimizing Israeli rule - control of the city council is likely to pass to a Palestinian majority . 
Peres understood that a Jerusalem united under exclusively Israeli rule was not feasible , assuring Norway &apos;s foreign minister in a 1993 letter - critical to the conclusion of the Oslo accords - that Israel would respect the autonomy of Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem . 
Likewise , in 2000 , Prime Minister Ehud Barak endorsed the Clinton Parameters , which called for Jerusalem &apos;s division into two capitals along ethnic lines . 
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert followed suit in his 2008 peace proposal to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas ; he also recommended internationalizing the Old City &apos;s administration . 
Yet Netanyahu and his supporters remain adamant that Jerusalem will not be split . 
What they fail to grasp is that the 1980 Jerusalem Law , which declared the city - &quot; united in its entirety &quot; - to be Israel &apos;s capital did not actually result in unity . 
The subsequent effort to &quot; Israelize &quot; the city , by building a network of Jewish neighborhoods in Palestinian-dominated East Jerusalem , has failed to secure a solid Jewish majority , largely owing to the unwillingness of middle-class Israelis to settle there . 
Indeed , not only has the settlement project turned East Jerusalem into a hub of political and social tension , but the high financial cost - more than $ 20 billion in total - forced the diversion of limited resources from growth-oriented investment in West Jerusalem . 
As a result , Jerusalem has become Israel &apos;s poorest city . 
Unsurprisingly , the 200,000 members of Israel &apos;s liberal and prosperous middle class that abandoned the city in the last 20 years find Tel Aviv - Israel &apos;s economic capital , and a center of technology-driven growth - far more appealing . 
Complicating the situation further is the division between secular Israelis and the fanatic Orthodox communities whose rejection of the secular state and yearning for a society based on the strictest interpretation of Halacha ( Jewish religious law ) epitomize a deep-seated fear of Arabs and an uncompromising distrust of gentiles . 
Such communities , which comprise 30 % of Jerusalem &apos;s population , make the notion of a united , peaceful Jerusalem farfetched , at best . 
In 1966 , a year before Israeli paratroopers ostensibly united Jerusalem , the composer Naomi Shemer sang of , &quot; the city that sits solitary , and in its heart a wall . &quot; 
Today , the wall dividing Jerusalem is not made of concrete or brick - but that does not make it any less real . 
This enduring division is exemplified in the contrast between municipal services and infrastructure in the city &apos;s Jewish and Arab neighborhoods . 
Of course , to some degree , Jerusalem &apos;s Palestinian residents benefit from Israel &apos;s advanced social-security and health-care systems , the likes of which their brethren in the Palestinian Authority can only imagine . 
Nonetheless , they continue to identify themselves as Palestinian , with only 10,000 of Jerusalem &apos;s 300,000 Palestinian residents having agreed to apply for Israeli citizenship . 
But the Jerusalem issue is subject to an even more fundamental confusion : What are Jerusalem &apos;s actual boundaries ? 
In the cavalier spirit that prevailed after 1967 , the Israeli government extended the city &apos;s boundaries from 10,875 acres to more than 31,000 acres . 
Netanyahu &apos;s claim that this extended Jerusalem is the biblical capital of the Jewish people is a historical travesty . 
A Jerusalem controlled by non-productive Orthodox Jewish communities and disenfranchised Palestinians is destined for economic and political collapse . 
Kerry &apos;s plan to divide the city along ethnic lines amounts to Israel &apos;s last chance to avoid such an outcome and legitimize the city as its internationally recognized capital . 
By agreeing to a divided Jerusalem , Netanyahu would be initiating the long-overdue departure from the hubris and megalomania that has brought the city to its current state of stagnation and isolation . 
Giving up on a &quot; united &quot; Jerusalem is the only way to secure the city &apos;s &quot; eternal &quot; status .
