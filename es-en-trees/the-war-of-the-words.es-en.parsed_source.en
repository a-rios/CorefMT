The War of the Words 
Nowadays , words are often seen as a source of instability . 
The violent reactions last year to the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad published in a Danish newspaper saw a confused Western response , with governments tripping over their tongues trying to explain what the media should and should not be allowed to do in the name of political satire . 
Then Iran trumped the West by sponsoring a conference of Holocaust deniers , a form of speech punished as criminal almost everywhere in Europe . 
As Turks well know , it is dangerous to take a position on the Armenian genocide of 1915 . 
The most recent Nobel laureate in literature , Orhan Pamuk , was prosecuted in Istanbul for denying Turkey &apos;s official history by saying that the Armenian genocide actually occurred . 
Other Turks have faced prosecution in Western Europe for saying that it did not . 
So words are now clearly a battlefield in the cultural conflict between Islam and the West . 
The West has learned that , simply as a matter of self-censorship , not legal fiat , newspapers and other media outlets will not disseminate critical pictures of Muhammad , and the Pope will no longer make critical comments about Islam . 
Instead , Mahmoud Ahmedinejad , Iran &apos;s president , has threatened to wipe Israel off the map . 
The Israeli Foreign Ministry now seeks prosecution of Ahmedinejad for incitement to commit genocide - a violation of international law . 
But the Israeli press is also bellicose . 
Israeli newspapers regularly carry stories about why Israel may need to attack Iran to prevent it from acquiring an arsenal of nuclear weapons . 
President George W. Bush has made similarly ominous , if more vague , statements about Iran . 
In Germany , preparing and calling for preemptive military strikes from within the government are subject to criminal sanctions . 
The world &apos;s different legal systems have never been in much agreement about the boundaries of free speech . 
Even between good neighbors like Canada and the United States , there is little agreement about punishing hate speech . 
Canadians punish racial insults , but Americans do not , at least if the issue is simply one of protecting the dignity of racial minorities . 
But threatening violence is more serious . 
Many countries are united in supporting the principle that if , say , Ahmedinejad does meet the criteria for incitement of genocide , he should be punished in the International Criminal Court . 
Indeed , the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda punished radio station operators who made aggressive public broadcasts urging Hutus to pick up their machetes and murder Tutsis . 
A decade ago there would have been a good argument in international law that the Hutu-Tutsi example supports prosecution only after the damage has been done . 
All the international precedents - from Nuremberg to the present - concern international intervention after mass atrocities . 
Domestic police may be able to intervene to prevent crime before it occurs , but in the international arena there is no police force that can do that . 
It follows , therefore , that the crime of incitement should apply only to cases like Rwanda , where the radio broadcasts actually contributed to the occurrence of genocide . 
In cases where bellicose leaders make public threats to &quot; bury &quot; another country ( remember Khrushchev ? ) or to wipe it off the map , the courts should wait , it was said , until some harm occurs . 
But the international community has become ever more intrusive in using legal remedies against persons who engage in provocative and dangerous speech . 
In September 2005 , the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1624 - paradoxically , with American approval - calling upon all member states to enact criminal sanctions against those who incite terrorism . 
The model of incitement they had in mind is the same one that British Prime Minister Blair has publicly invoked : Muslim leaders standing up in their mosques and urging their congregations to go out and kill infidels . 
Americans have traditionally said that , absent a risk of immediate unlawful violence , this form of speech should be protected under the First Amendment . 
US courts reasoned that it is better to allow the release of hateful sentiments than to call attention to them by showcasing them in court . 
So the traditional liberal position in support of giving wide scope to freedom of speech , even for extremists , is losing ground everywhere . 
When it comes to fighting terrorism and the prospect of genocide , the world is now becoming afraid of dangerous words .
