Stabilizing the Stans 
WASHINGTON , DC - Recent violence in Kazakhstan and Tajikistan , following civil strife in Kyrgyzstan in 2010 , has intensified international concern about Central Asia &apos;s security as the region becomes increasingly important for delivering NATO supplies to the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) in Afghanistan . 
Central Asian countries allow NATO members and partners to transport supplies through their territory to support military forces in Afghanistan - an essential complement to the flow of supplies to the ISAF through Pakistan , which is vulnerable to tensions with the United States . 
These countries have been logical partners for NATO in Afghanistan . 
They share Western concerns about a revival of the Afghan Taliban and their potential support for extremist Islamist movements in other Central Asian countries . 
Indeed , all five of the post-Soviet Central Asian countries - Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , and Uzbekistan - have been targeted by Muslim extremist organizations linked to the Taliban and al-Qaeda . 
Moreover , Central Asian leaders are eager to maintain NATO &apos;s presence in Eurasia as a way to balance China and Russia . 
Although the region &apos;s leaders generally enjoy good relations with both countries , they fear that Russian military and Chinese economic dominance could lead to the rise a Sino-Russian condominium at their expense . 
All Central Asian countries suffer from pervasive corruption , acute income inequalities , political succession problems , and transnational criminal groups that cooperate more effectively than the region &apos;s frequently feuding governments do . 
Deteriorating public services contributed to the overthrow of Kyrgyzstan &apos;s government , and could lead alienated citizens to support Islamist terrorists and other extremists . 
Although Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , and other Central Asian countries have resumed rapid economic growth , much of their recent progress simply correlates with surging world oil and gas prices . 
Growth could easily slow following the next energy-price slump or other external shock , such as proposals in Russia to limit employment and remittance opportunities for Central Asian workers there . 
All five countries have yet to fully recover from the disintegration of Soviet infrastructure networks , and require urgent domestic and region-wide measures to strengthen their education , transportation , energy provision , health care , and other public services . 
And their myriad interdependencies increase the risks of transnational threats , such as disease outbreaks , and resource-related confrontations . 
Social disorder in Tunisia , Egypt , Libya , and other Arab countries has invariably led observers to regard Central Asia &apos;s autocracies as potentially vulnerable to similar upheaval . 
Some Central Asian leaders have been in power for many years , and only Kyrgyzstan , the most impoverished of the five , has developed a competitive multi-party political system . 
Elsewhere , political parties are weak or are tools of the regime . 
But other factors make the Arab scenario less plausible in Central Asia . ­ ­ Security forces are more closely aligned with ruling elites ; independent political groups and social-media networks are less well developed ; economic performance remains high in some countries ; and a previous wave of revolutions produced disappointing results in Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan . 
Ensuring long-term stability will require poverty reduction , job creation , reduced income inequality , and the development of these countries &quot; human resources . 
Private-sector activity will not expand without healthy national banks subject to rigorous financial discipline and greater supervisory autonomy . 
Governments , facing pressure to increase spending , need to develop targeted social safety nets that protect their poorest people through cash or near-cash transfers . 
The International Monetary Fund recommends additional reforms aimed at improving labor-market flexibility , strengthening national competitiveness through investment in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure , and diversification away from natural-resource exports . 
Moreover , reducing trade barriers between these countries is essential for taking advantage of regional synergies and economies of scale . 
Central Asia &apos;s economies need greater access to their neighbors &quot; markets , energy , and transportation infrastructure . 
Above all , these states need to create a more favorable climate for business and foreign investment through enhanced transparency , improved governance , and more effective political , economic , and social institutions . 
Although some Central Asian countries have made progress , most still lag other emerging markets in accountability , rule of law , and reducing corruption . 
Elsewhere in the post-Soviet world , Georgia &apos;s success shows that determined governments can reduce even entrenched venality . 
In the meantime , Central Asian countries need sustained donor support , because private investment flows have not recovered to levels that preceded the global financial crisis . 
But foreign donors must exercise greater oversight and conditionality in their regional aid programs , as well as ensure that their assistance is better coordinated and integrated than in the past . 
Central Asia &apos;s hydrocarbon reserves , and its pivotal location , make it strategically important for many countries . 
Russian energy managers count on the region &apos;s oil and gas supplies to supplement stagnating domestic production . 
Western governments aim to circumvent Russia &apos;s pipelines and import some oil and gas directly . 
China views the region &apos;s resources as an essential complement to its more vulnerable maritime energy imports from Africa and the Persian Gulf , and has invested billions of dollars constructing overland pipelines . 
All of this serves to increase the political uncertainty that threatens the region &apos;s stability . 
These countries urgently need structural reforms that can generate more inclusive economic growth and political institutions that channel , rather than suppress , legitimate popular demands . 
Citizens who can help to shape their country &apos;s public policies through elections and other legal political activities are less likely to resort to extra-constitutional means .
