Thailand &apos;s Democratic Disorder 
BANGKOK - From Thailand to Turkey to Ukraine , the relationship between ruling majorities and electoral minorities has become combustible - and is threatening to erode the legitimacy of democracy itself . 
The unfolding crisis in Bangkok - where a political minority has taken to the streets to bring down Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra &apos;s democratically elected government - is a case in point . 
Yingluck &apos;s Pheu Thai Party ( PTP ) won an outright majority in Thailand &apos;s 2011 general election , gaining 265 MPs in the 500-member lower house . 
But the opposition Democratic Party - which returned 159 MPs , mainly from Bangkok and southern Thailand - has lately been staging protests in the capital . 
The so-called &quot; People &apos;s Committee for Democratic Reform &quot; - led by former Democratic Party MP Suthep Thaugsuban and supported by the Bangkok-based establishment - has effectively attempted to stage a coup . 
The protests began when the government tried to enact amnesty legislation that would have overturned the conviction of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra - Yingluck &apos;s brother and the PTP &apos;s founder , who was overthrown by the military in 2006 - on charges of corruption and abuse of power . 
( It also would have superseded the murder charges brought against the Democratic Party &apos;s leader , former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva . ) 
But Yingluck &apos;s subsequent attempt to backtrack on the amnesty measure failed to mollify the opposition . 
In fact , the street protests intensified , fueled by a new grievance . 
The Yingluck government had refused to accept the Constitutional Court &apos;s ruling against a bill to change the senate from a half-appointed to a fully elected chamber . 
The government asserted that the court did not have jurisdiction over constitutional amendments . 
The People &apos;s Committee viewed this rejection as an attempt to pressure the king into countersigning the law - and thus as a threat to royal prerogatives and the king &apos;s exalted role in Thailand . 
The People &apos;s Committee &apos;s position deserves explanation , if not agreement . 
Since the turn of the century , Thaksin &apos;s party machines , powered by his populist policies , have overcome constant challenges - from both the military and the Constitutional Court - to beat the conservative-royalist Democrats in every election . 
Opposition forces , fed up as much with Thaksin &apos;s corrupt practices as with his longstanding popularity , have recently begun seizing government ministries and calling for a royally appointed government . 
If they succeed , PTP supporters will likely descend on Bangkok , much as they did in 2009-2010 , after a &quot; judicial coup &quot; dissolved Thaksin &apos;s People &apos;s Power Party , the PTP &apos;s predecessor , and the Democrats formed a coalition government . 
But , this time , the protesters will be even angrier , and the stakes will be much higher , because the monarchy &apos;s role in Thailand &apos;s electoral democracy will be called into question . 
The mere plausibility of such an outcome underscores Thailand &apos;s deep political polarization . 
The PTP &apos;s supporters are happy with a system that grants them a political voice - indeed , predictable electoral majorities - and that safeguards their rights . 
But the minority - which comprises up to two-fifths of the electorate - is at a loss . 
Its legitimacy and influence depend not on winning electoral majorities , but on its strong alliances with the military , bureaucracy , and judiciary in defense of a traditional hierarchy that places the king at its apex . 
Making matters worse , voters on both sides are tuning in only to views with which they agree , rather than attempting to understand and reconcile opposing arguments . 
Social media - the much-lauded catalyst of democratization in authoritarian countries - has exacerbated the trend toward polarization in Thailand , just as it has in other electoral democracies that are struggling with a widening majority-minority divide , like Turkey and Malaysia . 
In emerging democracies , electoral minorities tend to be tied to the old establishment , and often oppose change led by popular upstarts . 
Feeling marginalized and resentful , they may turn to public platforms like social media and the streets to advance their causes and undermine their opponents &quot; authority . 
The proliferation of information technology , together with the unprecedented popular participation that it has fueled , means that electoral minorities have a growing number of increasingly powerful tools at their disposal to organize movements aimed at paralyzing their countries &quot; governments and even shortening leaders &quot; terms in office . 
Indeed , with so much seemingly at stake , a four- or five-year term may seem too long to wait for change . 
But , while the right to peaceful protest is critically important in a democracy , electoral minorities should not use endless demonstrations to take the political system hostage . 
In order to create a peaceful , stable , and effective democratic system , electoral minorities must accept the ballot box as the arbiter of political legitimacy . 
At the same time , majorities should not view an electoral victory as a license to act without regard for minority concerns . 
While the government must deliver for its constituents , it must also protect its opponents &quot; rights . 
To this end , Thailand urgently needs a new social contract that allows elected representatives to do their jobs , without marginalizing the establishment-based minority . 
Increasingly complex majority-minority dynamics are shaping the democratization prospects of a number of countries , and could influence democracy &apos;s durability as a system of government . 
Thailand &apos;s experience suggests that efforts to subvert the system by thwarting the will of the majority may ultimately be fruitless , though not before imposing extremely high costs on everyone .
