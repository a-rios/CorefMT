Netanyahu &apos;s Choice 
Ramallah - As the summit between US President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approaches , most of the discussion has focused on whether or not the newly elected Israeli leader will finally say that he backs a two-state solution . 
This is the wrong approach . 
Israelis should not determine the status of the Palestinian entity , nor should Palestinians have a say in what Israelis call their own state . 
The only question that Obama should ask Netanyahu is , When will Israel quit the occupied Palestinian territories ? 
Attempts at obfuscation - whether by talking about an &quot; economic peace , &quot; or insisting that Arabs recognize the Jewishness of the state of Israel - should not be allowed to derail the goal of ending the inadmissible occupation . 
During Obama &apos;s first meeting with a Middle East leader , a simple and courageous Arab plan was outlined . 
Empowered by Arab leaders , Jordan &apos;s King Abdullah II officially presented the peace plan devised by the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic States . 
Despite the Israeli wars on Lebanon and Gaza , Arabs offered normal relations with Israel once it quits the lands that it occupied in 1967 . 
The plan also calls for a &quot; fair &quot; and &quot; agreed upon &quot; resolution of the Palestinian refugee problem . 
The fact that Israelis and Palestinians need to agree on a solution of the refugee issue neutralizes unwarranted Israeli fears about the demographic threat posed by the Palestinians &quot; right of return . 
Last summer , when he was shown a poster with 57 flags representing the Arab and Islamic countries that will normalize relations with Israel , then candidate Obama told Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas that the Israelis would be &quot; crazy &quot; to reject that plan . 
Obama &apos;s impressive signals since taking office - telephoning Arab leaders before European allies , appointing special envoy George Mitchell and speaking on Al-Arabiyeh for his first interview - reflect a different approach from the staid and unimaginative past . 
The US has repeatedly opposed the 1967 Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and has called for its end . 
It has consistently voiced disapproval of settlement activities . 
Leaders of both major US parties have articulated a policy that calls for a viable , contiguous Palestinian state on the lands occupied in 1967 . 
The US has also opposed Israel &apos;s unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem , and - along with every country on the planet - refused to recognize the application of Israeli law to residents of East Jerusalem . 
Yet Israel &apos;s actions on the ground have gone counter to American and international positions . 
The newly established Israeli government refuses even to pay lip service to the internationally accepted requirements for peace . 
On the other hand , the freely elected Palestinian leadership faces international boycott until it accepts a solution that the Netanyahu government rejects . 
Among the international community &apos;s demands of Israel has been a total freeze on all settlement activity , including expansion and natural growth . 
Freezing settlement will certainly be a central focus of the robust diplomacy of Mitchell and his team . 
Mitchell , who was deeply involved in crafting the settlements language of the Mitchell Report of 2001 , understands the capacity of the settlements to destroy the prospect for a two-state solution . 
Jerusalem is another on-the-ground issue that will be a litmus test for the Obama administration . 
Demolition of Palestinian houses and Israeli provocations in East Jerusalem highlight the need to confront this issue without delay . 
The focus of Pope Benedict XVI &apos;s visit to the Middle East was Jerusalem &apos;s importance to Christians , Muslims , and Jews , so that attempts to Judaize the Holy City must stop immediately . 
A third imperative for Palestinians is to reunite the Gaza Strip and the West Bank . 
Irrespective of the outcome of the internal Palestinian dialogue taking place in Cairo , there is a need to reconnect Palestinians . 
There is no excuse why Palestinians living in either remaining sliver of Mandatory Palestine should be barred from traveling to the other part of the occupied Palestinian territories . 
Israeli officials &quot; claims that barring the movement of people and goods is required for security reasons do not withstand scrutiny . 
Under the leadership of US General Keith Dayton ( Mitchell &apos;s security deputy ) , the most vigorous security checks can be made to allow such travel . 
With renewed peace talks , results must be stressed over endless process . 
The last failed promise by President George W. Bush came at Annapolis in late 2007 , when he vowed that an independent , viable , and contiguous Palestinian state would be created before the end of his term . 
More than four decades after United Nations Security Council resolution 242 , occupying land by force , illegal construction of exclusive Jewish settlements , and restrictions on movement continue unabated . 
Time is no longer on the side of those who favor two states . 
The Obama administration must seize the initiative and insist that Netanyahu unequivocally support Israeli withdrawal from the Occupied Territories - the sine qua non for a two-state solution . 
Otherwise , tension looms in the Israeli-American relationship , and calls for one state with equal rights for all will begin to drown out older ideological visions , as settlement activity forecloses the prospect of two states .
