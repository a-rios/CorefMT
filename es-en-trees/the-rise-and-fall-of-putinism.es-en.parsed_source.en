The Rise and Fall of Putinism 
MOSCOW - How did &quot; Putinism &quot; - that distinctively Russian blend of authoritarian politics and dirigiste economics - happen ? 
And , now that it has , how can Russians move beyond it , to realize the rights and liberties promised to them in the country &apos;s constitution ? 
An active Russian civil society , which seemed to appear out of nowhere in Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s Soviet Union of 1989-1990 after the long Soviet hibernation , receded far too quickly . 
The astounding difficulty of everyday survival following the USSR &apos;s collapse trapped most Russians into focusing on their families &quot; most urgent needs . 
Civic apathy set in . 
So Vladimir Putin came to power at a very convenient moment for any ruler - when the people are quiescent . 
Cunningly , Putin then strapped this apathy to the first shoots of post-Soviet economic growth in order to conclude a new social contract : he would raise living standards in exchange for ordinary Russians &quot; acceptance of severe limits on their constitutional rights and liberties . 
Until recently , both sides adhered to this tacit contract . 
But , with the global financial crisis , the Kremlin stopped meeting its side of the bargain . 
Thus , a new social contract is needed , especially as a new , post-Soviet generation of Russians has entered political life - a generation that has not been poisoned by the fear that decades of state terror in the USSR implanted in their forebears . 
Putin and his entourage &quot; tightened the screws &quot; on Russia &apos;s people over the past decade , and faced almost no resistance to their claims to unchecked power . 
Now , from the entire spectrum of civil and political rights enumerated in Russia &apos;s Constitution , we Russians have only one right remaining : the right to leave and return to the country freely . 
All other rights have been lost or substantially weakened . 
But Russian citizens , especially younger ones , are beginning to realize what they have lost . 
By the same token , the post-Soviet generation has a very different idea of a decent standard of living than their parents had , and hence their aspirations are much higher . 
Many have traveled abroad , and all have seen foreign films , from which they have learned that people of their social status in the West have a far more comfortable life than they do . 
The majority of Soviet people did not have a car or a country house or even a separate apartment . 
Now the young feel deprived if they can &apos;t have all of that . 
At first , people did not think of civil rights as they strove for such previously unknown comforts . 
They relied on the Kremlin to set the conditions that would give them new opportunities . 
Now , they are gradually coming to understand that the government has failed them . 
A struggle for the restitution of constitutional rights in Russia first became noticeable in 2009 . 
At Triumph Square in Moscow , protestors have consistently demanded that Article 31 , which guarantees the right to peaceful assembly , be respected . 
Movement-31 , an umbrella grouping of like-minded protestors , has spread rapidly , staging simultaneous demonstrations in Moscow and 48 other cities two months ago in support of the right to free assembly . 
There have been simultaneous protests in the past , but usually against increases in rent or utility charges . 
One can understand why the demand to comply with Article 31 has gained popular support . 
For ordinary citizens , who have neither access to the media nor personal contacts with the authorities , protests are an opportunity to inform officials of their demands , requests , and suggestions . 
There are also other signs of awakening civic engagement , which are particularly evident in Internet discussions , which the Kremlin cannot control in the same way that it does other Russian media . 
Citizens have started to use the Internet for self-organization , for example , to generate simultaneous &quot; flash mobs , &quot; as well as protests by automobile owners , in different cities . 
Most recently , the Internet has become a means of public control over civil-rights violations by the authorities , as images taken with mobile phones become available instantaneously to all . 
The authorities have to reckon with the fallout , punishing officials who have come into the spotlight this way . 
Russia &apos;s federal government and regional authorities are clearly alarmed by this rapidly growing civic activism . 
But , despite changed conditions , they respond with the same old methods - suppression , intimidation , and misinformation . 
And , with elections to the State Duma due in December 2011 , followed by the presidential election in March 2012 , officials are particularly concerned by an upsurge of civic activism . 
It is not hard to see why . 
Over the past decade , the electoral system was &quot; improved &quot; in such a way that no outcome can lead to a change in the federal government . 
That leaves street demonstrations and other forms of civic activism as the only way to challenge Putinism &apos;s standard-bearers . 
Indeed , given state control of the mainstream media , such activism may be the only way to learn what citizens really think about their rulers .
