China in Action on Climate Change 
Beijing - Climate change is a serious challenge to humanity and sustainable development , which requires both proactive responses and concerted effort by the international community . 
China attaches great importance to tackling climate change . 
In 2007 , it established the National Leading Group on Climate Change ( NLGCC ) , headed by Premier Wen Jiabao . 
That same year , China issued its National Climate Change Program , the first ever by a developing country . 
In its National Climate Change Program , China set an objective to lower its energy consumption per unit of GDP by 20 % or so of 2005 level by 2010 and in its Mid- and Long-Term Plan for the Development of Renewable Energy , China also sets an objective of increasing the proportion of renewable energy in the primary energy mix to 10 % by 2010 , and to 15 % by 2020 . 
To achieve such objectives , China has adopted a series of effective policies and measures , achieving remarkable progress . 
Firstly , China succeeded in lowering its energy consumption per unit of GDP by 1.79 % , 4.04 % and 4.59 % respectively for 2006 , 2007 , and 2008 , which strongly suggests the prospect of meeting the 20 % objective by 2010 . 
Secondly , between 2006 and 2008 , China shut down small thermal power-generation units with a total installed capacity of 34.21 GW , phased out 60.59 million tons of backward steel-making capacity , 43.47 million tons of iron-smelting capacity and 140 million tons of cement-production capacity . 
All of these steps reduced pollution markedly . 
Thirdly , between 2000 and 2008 , China increased its wind power generating capacity from 340 MW to 10 GW , hydropower from 79.35 GW to 163 GW , and nuclear power from 2.1 GW to 9.1 GW . 
It has also made great efforts to reduce agricultural and rural greenhouse gas emissions . 
Indeed , by the end of 2007 , more than 26.5 million rural households were using household biogas digesters , thereby avoiding CO2 emissions by 44 million tons . 
Fourthly , China has increased its carbon sinks by promoting reforestation . 
China &apos;s forest coverage rate increased from 12 % in the early 1980 &quot; s to 18.21 % today . 
For this year , China will complete formulating provincial climate change programs throughout the country , promoting effective implementation of the National Climate Change Program . 
Furthermore , in China &apos;s economy stimulus package , 210 billion yuan is allocated for energy conservation , pollutants reduction , and ecosystem protection projects , 370 billion yuan for economic structural adjustment and technology renovation , and 400 billion yuan for new energy-efficient housing that will use environmentally friendly materials . 
Besides , 370 billion yuan will be used to improve rural living standards in an environmentally sound manner and sustainable way . 
China is making huge efforts to combat climate change despite the fact that it remains a low-income developing country with a per-capita GDP of just about $ 3,000 . 
Indeed , by United Nations standards , China still has 150 million people living in poverty . 
China has no other choice but to pursue sustainable development in order to meet the basic needs of its people and to eradicate poverty . 
In this process , the world is assured that China will make every effort to address climate change . 
The international community has great expectations for reaching a positive outcome in Copenhagen . 
In China &apos;s view , the key to the success in Copenhagen lies in the realization of the full , effective and sustained implementation of the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol ( KP ) . 
Developed country Parties to the KP , collectively , must reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25-40 % below their 1990 level by 2020 . 
For Non-KP developed countries , they should undertake comparable commitments with quantified emission reduction targets . 
Developed countries should also fulfill their obligations under the Convention to provide financial support and technology transfer to enable developing countries to effectively tackle climate change . 
In addition , appropriate mechanisms and institutional arrangements should be established for adaptation , financial support and technology transfer . 
Developing countries will , in the context of sustainable development and with measurable , reportable , and verifiable support in terms of financing , technology , and capacity-building , take nationally appropriate mitigation actions . 
The global financial crisis has undoubtedly exacerbated the challenge of climate change . 
But since climate change is a more far-reaching and serious challenge , the world must not waver in its determination and commitment to addressing it . 
Indeed , the international financial crisis , if handled properly , may also be turned into an opportunity to reach a win-win solution for both climate protection and economic development . 
With a deep sense of responsibility for its own people and the entire human race , China will continue to implement proactive policies and measures to address climate change and make unremitting efforts to the protection of earth system .
