The Transition to Sustainability 
NEW YORK - The global economic crisis will be with us for a generation , not just a year or two , because it is really a transition to sustainability . 
The scarcity of primary commodities and damage from climate change in recent years contributed to the destabilization of the world economy that gave rise to the current crisis . 
Soaring food and fuel prices and major natural disasters played an important role in undermining financial markets , household purchasing power , and even political stability . 
Viewed in this way , an essential policy that developed and developing countries should pursue in overcoming the crisis is to build infrastructure suitable for the twenty-first century . 
This includes an efficient electricity grid fed by renewable energy ; fiber and wireless networks that carry telephony and broadband Internet ; water , irrigation , and sewerage systems that efficiently use and recycle fresh water ; urban and inter-city public transit systems ; safer highways ; and networks of protected natural areas that conserve biodiversity and the habitats of threatened species . 
More importantly , they are needed in the long term , because a world crowded with 6.8 billion people ( and rising ) simply cannot sustain economic growth unless it adopts sustainable technologies that economize on scarce natural resources . 
In practice , the global crisis means that sustainable investments are being curtailed rather than expanded in the developing world . 
As access to international bank loans , bond flotations , and foreign direct investment is lost , infrastructure projects talked about in the past are now being shelved , threatening the political and economic stability of dozens of developing countries . 
In fact , every part of the world has a huge backlog of vital infrastructure investments . 
It is time for a concerted global effort to bring those projects on line . 
This is not easy to do . 
Most infrastructure investment requires public-sector leadership to forge partnerships with the private sector . 
Typically , the public sector must enter into contractual agreements with private firms not only to build the infrastructure , but also to operate it as a regulated monopoly or on a concession basis . 
Governments generally lack the needed technical capacity to design such projects , opening up possibilities of favoritism and corruption when major contracts are awarded . Such charges are likely to be hurled at governments even when they are not true , though all too often they are . 
Still , the backlog of such projects is now wreaking havoc with the world economy . 
The world &apos;s major cities are clogged with traffic jams and pollution . 
The atmosphere is filling with greenhouse gases from heavy use of fossil fuels . 
Water scarcity is hitting virtually every major economic center , from North America to Europe , Africa , India , and China . 
Governments should thus strengthen their ministries of infrastructure ( including power , roads , water and sanitation , and information and communication technologies ) , as well as their national development banks , so that they can properly design long-term infrastructure projects and programs . 
The ability to offset the crisis in a constructive manner through expanded public-private partnerships will determine the subsequent success of countries and regions . 
Interestingly , the US is about to create a National Infrastructure Bank for the first time . 
Nevertheless , American and European economic advisers generally believe that a short sharp stimulus will be enough to restore economic growth . 
This is wrong . 
What will be needed is an overhaul of the world economy towards sustainability . 
Moreover , policymakers in the rich world believe that they can continue to neglect the developing world , or leave it to its fate in global markets . 
This is also a recipe for global failure , and even future conflict . 
Developed countries will have to do far more to help poor countries through the transition to sustainability . 
Whereas most of the &quot; stimulus &quot; legislation to date has been short-term and inward-looking , increased funding for sustainable infrastructure in poor countries would provide a powerful boost to rich-world economies . 
Developed countries should agree to channel considerable savings to developing countries to finance the scale-up of sustainable investments . 
This can be done directly on a bilateral basis , for example , through long-term loans from developed countries &quot; export-credit agencies . 
It can also be done multilaterally , by raising the infrastructure investment flows from the World Bank and the regional development banks ( including the Inter-American Development Bank , European Investment Bank , African Development Bank , and Asian Development Bank ) . 
Both channels should be used . 
Developed countries also fail to recognize that without much greater financing of sustainable infrastructure in the developing world - especially sustainable power generation and transmission - a global agreement on climate change later this year ( or any time soon ) will be impossible . 
The rich world somehow expects poor countries to restrict their use of fossil fuels without any significant help in financing new and sustainable sources of energy . 
In almost all of the rich-country proposals about targets , limits , commitments , and permits for greenhouse gases , there is hardly a word about helping poor countries to finance the transition to sustainable technologies . 
The G-20 meeting in London on April 2 offers hope for a true global effort to repair the failing world economy . 
This is the time and place to launch the global drive toward sustainability . 
If we fail to meet the challenge , the global crisis will endanger the world for years to come .
