The Fragile Roots of Productivity Growth 
How fast is the US economy now growing ? 
Smart investors are now betting that the most recent economic data will show an annual GDP growth rate of 3 % for the second quarter of 2003 . 
They are also betting that the current third quarter may well show a growth rate as high as 5 % per year . 
July saw American industrial production jump by half a percent , while Intel , the big microprocessor maker , is reporting very strong growth in demand for its key products , suggesting that business investment spending is finally accelerating . 
Although Japan continues to stagnate , and Western Europe hovers on the edge of recession , a solid &quot; output-growth &quot; recovery in the US should prove to be a big help in boosting demand in the rest of the world . 
But this good news about the US business cycle has been accompanied by bad news about employment . 
Hours worked in American business fell at a 2.7 % annual rate in the second quarter . 
Employment-particularly manufacturing employment-fell in July . 
It is very likely that hours worked will continue to fall in the third quarter . 
What accounts for this wide divergence ? 
How can America see reasonably rapid output growth and yet rising unemployment ? 
The answer is that the underlying trend of productivity growth in the American economy continues to be exceptionally positive . 
The 5.7 % annual productivity gain recorded in the second quarter seems likely to be matched in July-September . 
With America &apos;s workers producing more in less time , it is no wonder that a wedge is being driven between the ( good ) output news and the ( bad ) employment news . 
In the short run , rapid productivity growth poses dilemmas for macroeconomic management , because what would otherwise be seen as reasonably strong demand growth is proving to be insufficient to keep unemployment low . 
But the short-run view is not the important one . 
Rapid productivity growth is-in the long run-good news for America : a higher-productivity economy is better at enhancing human welfare . 
In the long run , this is also good news for America &apos;s trading partners : there is more value to be gained by trading with a richer economy than with a poorer one . 
The continuation of rapid US productivity growth through the recent recession and into the subsequent low-wattage recovery is a very strong piece of evidence that America &apos;s long-run rate of GDP and productivity growth has shifted upward permanently , or , if not permanently , at least for a period of time likely to be measured in decades . 
America , of course , is not alone among industrial nations that have seen productivity growth accelerate since the second half of the 1990 &apos;s . 
Australia , Ireland , and the Scandinavian countries all had their own sustained bursts of unexpectedly rapid growth . 
But the rest of Western Europe and Japan have not . 
Western Europe and Japan have vibrant high-tech sectors , able executives , and cultures easily as capable as the US of taking advantage of the boom promised by the rapidly falling prices of information technology . 
So you would think that the same productivity revolution would happen in those countries . 
Yet there has been no sign of it . 
Why not ? 
The current conventional wisdom , most strongly advocated by the American economist Robert Gordon , is that the burst of productivity growth that the US is currently experiencing ( and that will turn into a full-fledged economic boom whenever demand growth becomes rapid enough ) is due to synergy . 
According to this view , the US is especially well positioned to benefit from rapidly falling prices of information technology , owing to its openness to competition and new ways of doing business , particularly in distribution . 
The comparison between the late 1990 &apos;s and early 2000 &apos;s in America and in Western Europe compels us to reflect on how fragile the underlying institutional mechanisms needed to support rapid economic growth truly are . 
Western Europe and the US are both post-industrial democracies . 
Both possess market economies . 
Both have large and powerful social insurance systems . 
Of course , institutional differences between America and Western Europe do exist : in the regulation of labor , in restrictions on land-use and redevelopment , in the tolerance of competition authorities for resale price maintenance and related practices . 
But are these differences really so large as to affect macroeconomic performance so dramatically ? 
In Robert Gordon &apos;s estimation-and in mine-the roots of an economy-wide high-tech productivity boom like the one seen in the US are so delicate that they flourish in American but not in continental European soil .
