Germany &apos;s Neighborhood Watch 
FRANKFURT - On a recent trip to Germany , I was struck by two distinct narratives . 
One narrative features a robust German economy with low unemployment , strong finances , and the right competitive position to exploit the most dynamic segments of global demand . 
The other narrative describes an economy that is encumbered by never-ending European debt crises whose perpetrators seek to shift their responsibility - and their financing needs - onto Germany &apos;s pristine balance sheet . 
Both narratives are understandable . 
After all , it is difficult to be a good house in a deteriorating neighborhood . 
Either the neighborhood improves , or the value of the house declines . 
And it matters a great deal which narrative prevails - for Germany , for Europe , and for the global economy . 
Germany today is reaping the benefits of many years of responsible domestic economic management . 
In addition to maintaining sound public finances , German leaders implemented difficult structural reforms aimed at improving international competitiveness , including painful labor-market reforms . 
As a result , Germany is one of the few advanced economies today that has created many jobs and maintained financial stability . 
In other words , it is the AAA of AAAs . 
Yet Germany is also part of a highly challenged neighborhood , if not its anchor . 
Its neighbors include countries - most notably on the eurozone &apos;s periphery - that are struggling . 
They have high overall unemployment ( and alarmingly high youth joblessness ) , and are unable to grow on their own power . 
In some cases , they also face solvency questions , and are far from achieving the socio-political consensus needed to get their economic houses in order . 
To state the obvious , this contrast between Germany and its neighborhood is very awkward . 
It fuels endless internal and external tensions , encourages finger pointing , and promotes a loud and disruptive blame game . 
And all of this distracts attention from the need to compete in a rapidly changing global economy . 
The longer all of this persists , the more it tears at the fabric of European unity . 
Accordingly , European officials need to continue to make steadfast progress in three major areas : 
· 
Improve individual countries &quot; domestic policy mix in a manner that targets debt sustainability through both growth promotion and deficit reduction , especially in the most vulnerable peripheral economies ; 
· 
Enhance the eurozone &apos;s internal financial circuit breakers to reduce the risk of disruptive financial feedback loops and destabilizing multiple equilibria ; and 
· 
Strengthen the eurozone &apos;s institutional underpinnings , as well as its mechanisms for policy coordination and peer review . 
None of these steps is easy ; and they are certainly not automatic . 
Moreover , to maximize their effectiveness , they must be implemented simultaneously ; indeed , this is a situation in which one plus one plus one equals more than three . 
And this will not happen unless two other , even more controversial steps are taken . 
First , Germany must play an even larger role in conducting and coordinating the eurozone &apos;s policy responses . 
I know that many Germans are uncomfortable with this . 
But there is no workable alternative for Europe &apos;s well-being - and , therefore , that of Germany . 
The European Union &apos;s institutions still lack the authority and credibility needed to take on this role . 
The European Central Bank does not possess the proper structural policy tools , and it has already been forced to bear burdens that , arguably , are beyond its strictly defined mandate . 
And there is no other economy that comes close to Germany in size , influence , and economic and financial health . 
Second , the eurozone , led by a Germany that is working closely with France , needs to clarify decisively what it intends to look like in the medium term . 
There are two alternatives , both sensitive and controversial , and the choice is for Europeans alone to make and sustain ; but they must make it if they are decisively to put behind them the risk of eurozone fragmentation . 
On one hand , they can decide to let politics dominate economics . 
This is not easy for politicians to sell , especially in the core countries ( particularly Germany , Finland , and the Netherlands ) , as it would involve large multi-year subsidies to the periphery - or the analytical equivalent of the difficult decision made over 20 years ago to reunify Germany at a currency parity . 
Here , however , there is the added difficulty of a potential conflict between regional politics and national democratic processes . 
On the other hand , they can decide to allow economics to prevail . 
Here , eurozone members would collectively opt for a smaller and less imperfect union that includes countries with more similar initial conditions - economically , financially , politically , and socially . 
And , again , there is no easy way to do this , especially given that the eurozone was intentionally designed with no exit in mind . 
Until these difficult and controversial decisions are made , periods of relative tranquility in Europe are likely to be interrupted by the recurrent eruption of financial instability and bouts of political bickering and dithering . 
And the longer this continues , the greater the risk that Germany &apos;s neighborhood will erode the robustness of what the country has painstakingly built . 
Ultimately , there can be no strong Germany without a stable eurozone ; no stable eurozone without a strong Germany ; and no global economic stability without both . 
It is time for Europeans to make the difficult longer-term choices that are critical to sustaining and enhancing their historical regional project .
