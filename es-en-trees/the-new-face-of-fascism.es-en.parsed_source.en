The New Face of Fascism 
Extreme-right and post-fascist parties , whose rising popularity caused alarm across Western Europe a few years ago , seem to be fading from the electoral scene . 
But does this mean that political radicalism , extreme-right sentiments , and fascism in Europe are dying out ? 
Hardly . 
Just as both extreme-right and post-fascist groups in Western Europe weaken , Eastern Europe has seen a revival of extreme-right and fascist parties , most ominously with the successes of nationalist radicals in the recent Russian and Serbian elections . 
At the same time , the costs of weakening extreme-right , nationalist , and post-fascist parties in Western and Central Europe have been high : mainstream political forces were forced to adopt some of the extreme right &apos;s vocabulary and agenda . 
Many mainstream European politicians and parties now espouse anti-immigration policies , express greater skepticism toward European integration , or wield a form of anti-Semitism that masquerades as criticism of Israel &apos;s policies . 
Extremist parties have also been marginalized owing to their weak position in pan-European politics . 
Voters in Italy , France , the Netherlands , or Austria - the countries in which post-fascist or extreme-right parties incited the greatest concerns - gradually realized that mainstream democratic forces in Europe would allow extremist parties only limited influence in the European Parliament and other EU institutions . 
Some - for example , JÃ¶rg Haider &apos;s Free Democrats in Austria , or Gianfranco Fini &apos;s Italian post-fascists - were forced to temper their radicalism after joining government coalitions . 
While xenophobia - provoked mostly by fears about immigration , EU enlargement , and pressures of globalization - has driven West European extremism , xenophobic radicalism in Europe &apos;s east has different causes . 
The recent electoral successes of the Serbian Radical Party of Vojislav Seselj , Russian nationalist parties , as well as the strong position of Vadim Tudor &apos;s Greater Romania Party in Romania , were caused mainly by a combination of rabid nationalism and the pressures of modernization . 
These countries , after some delay , are following in the footsteps of some postcommunist nations in Central Europe , where nationalist / populist parties , such as the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia of Vladimir Meciar , retarded democratization and market reform a decade ago . 
As in Western Europe , in most postcommunist countries that will become EU members in May 2004 , both political radicalism and nationalism have been neutralized at the cost of being to some extent embraced by mainstream political parties . 
Milder versions of nationalist , euroskeptic , or xenophobic slogans can now be heard from political parties such as the Czech Republic &apos;s Civic Democrats or Hungary &apos;s Fidesz , the largest opposition forces in those countries . 
In other words , both the language and the agenda that originally belonged to extreme-right parties have been appropriated by the political mainstream . 
But Russia , Serbia , and Romania probably have a more difficult road ahead in fending off their extremists . 
First , unlike the postcommunist countries of Central Europe , they lack Western political and philosophical traditions . 
Close ties between the state and their Orthodox churches forged state religions that helped to create a strong sense of national messianism . 
So nationalists in Russia , Serbia , and Romania draw on deep-rooted beliefs that their nations have special historical missions . 
Second , because the role of the state has traditionally been strong in these countries - the democratic separation of powers and efforts to introduce the rule of law are relatively new developments - corporatist tendencies that characterized , for example , Italian fascism in the 1930 &apos;s , remain potent . 
Finally , globalization , the pressures arising from market reform , modernization of institutions , and other new phenomena , disrupt and disorient these societies . 
A strong sense of historical mission , social and economic problems , a diminished international status : all combine to form an explosive mix that plays into the hands of radicals . 
So , at least in these three countries , the rise of post-fascist tendencies , nationalism , and political extremism may not be temporary , as in Central Europe , or remain the marginal phenomena witnessed recently in Western Europe . 
But important differences between Russia , Serbia , and Romania should be noted . 
The last of the three countries is a candidate for EU membership in 2007 , and the accession process has had a moderating effect on Romanian politics . 
Romania &apos;s two million ethnic Hungarians , the main political targets of Romanian nationalists , represent a bridge to the EU , because Hungary will be a member of the EU three years before Romania . 
Transylvania , where the country &apos;s ethnic Hungarians are overwhelmingly concentrated , is also Romania &apos;s cultural bridge to the West , because this part of Romania belonged for centuries to the Hapsburg Empire . 
The hope of EU membership gives mainstream Romanian politicians and the Romanian public strong incentives not to succumb to nationalist sentiments . 
Serbia and Russia pose more difficult cases , as the national pride of both - for different reasons - has been wounded . 
While Russia has almost completely lost its superpower status , Serbia was deeply humiliated by NATO in 1999 . 
Many Serbs also feel mortified by the ongoing trials of their former leaders at the International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague . 
The international community , especially the EU , can offer few incentives to encourage moderate politics in these two countries . 
Moreover , the average Russians &apos; experiences of liberal economic and political reforms since communism &apos;s fall have been rather negative . 
While most Russians seem to realize that their country can no longer be &quot; salvaged &quot; by the Communists , many are betting on semi-authoritarian rule and national revival stemming from traditional Russian values . 
That fusion , however , remains modern politics &apos;other lethal temptation .
