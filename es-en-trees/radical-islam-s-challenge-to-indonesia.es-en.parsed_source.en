Radical Islam \ u0027s Challenge to Indonesia 
With the Taliban on the run , sighs of relief can be heard as far away as Indonesia . 
Protests against the US-led coalition &apos;s bombing campaign had roiled Indonesia for weeks , increasing the country &apos;s already perilous instability . 
Now that the war in Afghanistan may wind down soon , there is a fear that President Megawati Sukarnoputri will do little to change her do-nothing ways . 
These protests came as Mrs Megawati &apos;s first 100 days in office ended . 
They were but another sign of the scant political honeymoon she enjoyed . 
Grumbling about her &quot; slow motion &quot; style of government can be heard everywhere ; applause for her few accomplishments - such as weathering the Islamic storm - is slight . 
Public expectations about Mrs Megawati were modest from the start . 
In her report to the annual session of the People &apos;s Consultative Assembly , delivered on November 1 , Megawati admitted that her government had achieved little . 
The Assembly sought to fill this policy vacuum by outlining steps that her government must take to jump-start the economy . 
Although the Assembly remains dubious about her , Mrs Megawati was heartened when Assembly Chairman Amien Rais foreswore any challenge to her presidency for the remainder of her term , which expires in 2004 . 
So Megawati need not worry about being ejected from office as her predecessor Abdurrahman Wahid was , just a few months ago . 
But Amien Rais &apos; statement is as much self-serving as it is in the interest of political stability . 
He is the only viable rival candidate for President Megawati &apos;s job , and would be the man to step into the presidential palace should she be removed . 
No politician with any common sense ( which Mr Rais has in abundance ) would seek to unseat Megawati at this moment , for the challenges she faces are daunting and the chances of success small . 
Many people suspect that Megawati &apos;s inactivity results from her recognition of the almost intransigent nature of the challenges facing Indonesia . 
Hers is a kind of &quot; self-healing &quot; administration in which events are left to run their course in the hope that they won &apos;t get out of hand . 
So Amien Rais &apos; assurance that Megawati will remain president until 2004 will not have injected a greater urgency into her presidency . 
Her sense of security ( and hence her indolence ) is also increased because her political opponents are in complete disarray . 
But government by sleepwalking is risky in a country &apos;s whose territorial integrity seems to be coming apart at the seams . 
The unified Indonesia of the past 40 years or so is finished . 
A new regional autonomy law will provide greater freedoms for regions and local communities to express themselves . 
Right now , this decentralization process is manageable . 
It may not remain so without a firm policy hand at the center . 
If the central government refrains from re-imposing its power in the regions , either administratively or militarily , they are more likely to remain within the Republic . 
Granting special autonomy to the two most strife-ridden provinces - Aceh and Papua ( Irian Jaya ) - may also reduce tension between national and local military commanders . 
However , the deep wounds of the past few years of violence will not heal unless serious efforts are made by the government in Jakarta to bring human rights abusers to justice . 
Megawati promised to pursue human rights violators , but few actions have been taken to enforce this promise . 
Such inaction cannot last if national unity is to be maintained . 
A credible system to manage Indonesia &apos;s new decentralized system is needed . 
Regions must be prevented from promulgating regulations that violate national laws or impose negative effects on other regions , as has happened with the creation by some regions of internal trade barriers . 
Because of the government &apos;s inactivity , such barriers are rising across the Indonesian archipelago . 
Regional autonomy , moreover , has not pacified ethnic tensions . 
Violent conflicts among Indonesia &apos;s myriad ethnic and religious groups continue . 
Radical Muslim groups have declared holy war , &quot; jihad , &quot; which has complicated and aggravated conflicts in the Moluccan islands . 
Fundamentalist Islamic groups , indeed , raised the most consistent challenge to Megawati &apos;s &quot; secular &quot; government even before the attacks on America . 
They are not yet a serious threat to Megawati , only because they are not backed by Indonesia &apos;s powerful Islamic political parties . 
Mrs Megawati &apos;s challenge is to keep these Islamic parties firmly within Indonesia &apos;s conventional political framework . 
In the first month of the war on terrorism , some Islamic political parties were drawn into anti-American protests and even Vice President Hamzah Haz ( chairman of one of Indonesia &apos;s strongest Islamic parties ) was tempted to ride this tiger for a time . 
During Megawati &apos;s trip to America to support President Bush &apos;s policy , indeed , the government in Jakarta was almost incapacitated by these small , noisy and radical Islamic groups . 
On her return , Megawati restored her credibility by ordering the security services to act against these groups . 
This restored order . 
Credit for the absence of a truly serious Islamic challenge , however , should perhaps be given to Indonesia &apos;s moderate and mainstream Muslim leaders and groups , such as Nahdatul Ulama and Muhammadyah , who avoided incendiary words and deeds . 
Their responsible behavior demonstrates the growing importance of Indonesia &apos;s civil society . 
Because Indonesia &apos;s government will likely be weak for years to come , Mrs Megawati should forge alliances with the many civil society groups that are emerging in Indonesia and which support a democratic regime . 
Such activity by the President will do more to root Indonesia &apos;s democracy than any other action Megawati might take .
