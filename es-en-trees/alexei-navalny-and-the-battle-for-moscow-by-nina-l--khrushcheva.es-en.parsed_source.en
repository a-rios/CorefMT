Can Navalny Save Russia ? 
MOSCOW - In 1811 , assessing the possibility - or , rather , the impossibility - of Russia ever undergoing a Western-style transformation , the diplomat and counter-Enlightenment philosopher Joseph de Maistre famously wrote , &quot; Every nation has the government it deserves . &quot; 
Fourteen years later , the Decembrist revolt - a movement of poets and army officers to topple Czar Nicholas I and establish a constitutional monarchy - seemed to refute de Maistre &apos;s claim . 
Yet the revolt was suppressed , and the Decembrists were executed or exiled . 
One doomed officer famously declared , &quot; You can &apos;t hang us all . &quot; 
Russia &apos;s brutal twentieth century , with its totalitarianism and gulags , nearly proved that officer - and de Maistre - wrong . 
No one &quot; deserves &quot; to be ruled so monstrously . 
An estimated 20 million Russians perished under Stalin &apos;s rule , and the rest were paralyzed with terror . 
The twenty-first century has been kinder to Russians , at least so far . 
But , while terror and famine have been absent , many of the oppressive tactics of the past have been revived under Vladimir Putin &apos;s misrule , now in its 14th year . 
Since 2003 , when the billionaire oil oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested for alleged embezzlement and fraud - after he dared to support Putin &apos;s political opponents - Russia &apos;s elite has been largely brought to heel . 
None of them envisaged rotting in a labor camp like Khodorkovsky . 
Under Putin , it seems , de Maistre &apos;s maxim has received a new lease on life . 
Then in 2011 , massive protests against Putin and his party of &quot; crooks and thieves &quot; erupted , and Alexei Navalny , who coined that epithet , became the face of Russia &apos;s opposition . 
Navalny , a 37-year-old anti-corruption lawyer , has been a thorn in Putin &apos;s side ever since . 
Recently , he announced that he has presidential ambitions ; in the meantime , he is seeking to become the mayor of Moscow ( arguably the second most important political post in Russia ) . 
The mayoral campaign is now in full swing , with the election on September 8 the first in Moscow in ten years , as Putin had simply been appointing loyalists as mayors and governors throughout the country . 
The incumbent mayor , Sergey Sobyanin , who has the full support of the Kremlin political-media machine , has been receiving personal-approval ratings above 90 % in recent opinion polls . 
But Navalny &apos;s approval ratings are not far behind , at 80 % , and he has achieved them entirely on his own . 
Navalny &apos;s candidacy received a recent boost when he became a convicted criminal , following a trial that resembled Khodorkovsky &apos;s in terms of blatant political manipulation . 
Accused of fraud , Navalny received a five-year prison sentence for allegedly embezzling from Kirovles , a provincial timber company . 
But , in an unusual twist , Navalny was released from custody pending appeal of his conviction only a day after it was handed down . 
That , some say , was because his supporters immediately took to the streets . 
The likelier motivation is that Putin decided to let the election play out , relying on Navalny to lose . 
In that case , Sobyanin , who was appointed in 2010 , would gain the legitimacy that he has lacked until now , and the opposition movement would be discredited in the capital , whose residents form the core of Navalny &apos;s political base . 
But what if Navalny is elected ? 
Would he go to prison , Muscovites &quot; choice notwithstanding ? 
In a new challenge to de Maistre &apos;s maxim , almost 200 young businessmen overcame the fear inspired by Khodorkovsky &apos;s fate and donated funds to Navalny &apos;s campaign . 
Thirty-seven of them signed what they called a new &quot; social contract . &quot; 
According to their manifesto , they &quot; expect Navalny to defend the rule of law , support independent courts , and ensure that officials are really accountable before society . &quot; 
They are investing &quot; reputational , financial , organizational , and other resources &quot; in a man who promises to hire competent advisers and free the city - and eventually the country - from endemic corruption and abuse of power . 
Most of these young entrepreneurs have risen within the &quot; knowledge economy . &quot; 
They include the inventor of a cloud-computing service , the founder of an online luxury-goods business , a developer of new banking technologies , and the creator of a social-networking platform for doctors . 
All of them have good educations , and many hold American business degrees . 
Many of these business leaders would have preferred to stay out of politics ; but Russia &apos;s poor education system , economic feudalism , official homophobia , and other festering problems have left them no choice . 
And Putin himself has become an insufferably vulgar embarrassment . 
To be sure , Navalny &apos;s backers could emigrate comfortably ; but , invigorated by their candidate &apos;s campaign , they are willing to see whether he can make a difference . 
Indeed , Navalny has become the only hope for competitive politics in Russia . 
At the same time , Navalny &apos;s unapologetic nationalism makes many people nervous . 
And , while Russian leaders may start out as reformers , they do not often remain so . 
Boris Yeltsin began the 1990 &quot; s as a courageous democrat , only to end up a corrupt , bibulous buffoon , while Putin initially vowed to bring law and order to the post-Yeltsin chaos . 
So Moscow &apos;s mayoral election is a moment of truth for Navalny , the business leaders investing in his campaign , all Muscovites , and perhaps Russia as a whole . 
As in the time of the Decembrists , anyone in Russia can suffer from overweening government power , regardless of political belief . 
Fear and apathy have become riskier than taking a stand . 
But the question remains : Come September 8 , can Navalny and his supporters change Russia &apos;s political culture of fear , or was de Maistre right after all ?
