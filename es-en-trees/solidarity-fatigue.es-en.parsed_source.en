Solidarity Fatigue 
Democracy tarnishes its heroes as surely as revolutions devour their children . 
For 25 years , the leaders of Solidarity personified the qualities needed to win Poland &apos;s struggle for democracy : unbending courage in the face of the communist Leviathan and magnanimity and clear-sighted determination during the transfer of power . 
All of these were great and noble qualities , and all of them now seem utterly superfluous to most Poles . 
That is the sad lesson of Poland &apos;s parliamentary election two weeks ago , and of Sunday &apos;s indecisive presidential election ( which will be decided by a run off between Donald Tusk and Lech Kaczynski on October 23rd . ) 
To be sure , the communists-cum-postcommunists who have dominated Polish politics since 1989 were utterly repudiated - the left got scarcely 11 % of the vote in the parliamentary poll . 
But Solidarity &apos;s old guard has also been cast aside . 
Poland yearns for something new . 
Poland &apos;s recent elections were the first in which the postcommunist left was irrelevant . The postcommunists know that they can no longer live off their legacy of organization and discipline , so they have chosen a clever and attractive 34-year-old leader . 
He has nothing to do with the communist era and has sacked all former Party members from important positions , even barring former Prime Minister Leszek Miller from standing for parliament . 
This is undoubtedly all to the good . 
But the overall health of Polish democracy is another matter . 
Turnout for the parliamentary election was 40 % , which puts Poland near the bottom in voter participation among the democratic nations of the world , and about 25-30 % below the European average . 
Political apathy reflects many factors , but two stand out . 
A few days before the parliamentary election , people were asked if they hoped for a better life . 
An astounding 60 % said that they do not . 
Hopeless people do not vote . 
Second , one of the necessary conditions of a functioning democracy are clear and sufficiently distinct party political programs . 
That is not the case in Poland . 
Parties &quot; programs changed with the public opinion polls , and their economic proposals were either too complicated or too muddled for voters to grasp . 
So the 40 % who voted did so for emotional reasons , not as a clear political choice . 
Among the leading politicians of the parties that overwhelmingly won the parliamentary elections - the neo-liberal Civic Platform and the conservative-populist Law and Justice - almost every face has been around since 1989 . 
The Solidarity / postcommunist divide seems to have pickled Polish politics , leaving it without a new generation of leaders and thus without enthusiasm . 
Unsurprisingly , the young are the most estranged . 
When I asked my students at Warsaw University how many intended to vote , only two raised their hands . 
Perhaps others were ashamed to say they care about politics and did , in fact , vote , but they can &apos;t have been many . 
An entire generation has grown up to be apolitical , even anti-political , which bodes ill for the future . 
The most difficult problems in Poland are unemployment , which hovers around 20 % - the highest rate in the EU - and the growing divide between rich and poor . 
Indeed , only in Russia ( and perhaps in Ukraine ) is the income gap wider . 
Yet neither of these issues was raised decisively in the campaign . 
The main issues that both victorious parties highlighted were the communist past and public corruption . 
Both are important issues , but they are secondary to the problems of joblessness and poverty . 
Indeed , it is estimated that 30 % of Polish children do not get enough to eat . 
This is Europe , so they do not die of hunger . 
This is all the more peculiar given that the victorious parties that emerged out of Solidarity are keen to promote its values , particularly &quot; solidarity &quot; with a small &quot; s . &quot; 
But their purpose is purely instrumental , for to call somebody a &quot; liberal &quot; nowadays in Poland is more pejorative than calling him a &quot; son of a bitch . &quot; 
Indeed , &quot; liberal &quot; in both its meanings - economic and moral - is disdained . 
Liberals are viewed as vampires , seeking only to make money for themselves and their cronies . 
So it is understandable that both leading presidential candidates , Donald Tusk and Lech Kaczynski , ran as fast as they could from &quot; liberal &quot; ideas . 
But what does small-s solidarity mean in practical terms ? 
Nobody knows , and neither Tusk nor Kaczynski was saying . 
They suggested only some vague notions of state intervention on behalf of the poor and needy . 
The death of postcommunism in Poland has thus been greeted not with a bang but with a whimper . 
There is nothing devastating in this , of course , but Poland &apos;s political malaise may one day prove dangerous , and so should be scrutinized in other democracies , old and new . 
For the problems of anomie , apathy , and political charade are not Polish problems , but maladies that increasingly afflict democracies everywhere , and that urgently call for a restoring of faith in parties and politics .
