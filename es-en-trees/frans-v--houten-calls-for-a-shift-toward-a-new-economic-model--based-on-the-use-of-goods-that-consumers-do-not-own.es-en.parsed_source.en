The Circular Revolution 
DAVOS - In the sixteenth century , the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus made a profound discovery : the sun , not the earth , was at the center of the known universe . 
At the time , many denounced Copernicus &apos;s insight as heresy against established Christian doctrine ; eventually , of course , the Copernican Revolution paved the way toward a new , scientific worldview and enhanced human prosperity . 
Today , the world needs a similar paradigm shift . 
But this time it is the prevailing economic model that must be transformed . 
By 2030 , the global middle class will total nearly five billion people , all of whom will expect the same kinds of opportunities and comforts that wealthy populations have long enjoyed . 
This will put increasing strain on the environment and deplete the world &apos;s stock of resources . 
The problem is that the world has long maintained a myopic focus on producing and consuming goods as cheaply as possible . 
The result is a linear economy based on the rapid use , disposal , and replacement of goods . 
Sustaining the current model would require unlimited , easily accessible resources and infinite space for waste - something that clearly is not possible . 
Indeed , the consequences of our disposable economy - skyrocketing CO2 emissions , unmanageable waste streams , and the increasing difficulty of extracting resources , to name a few - are already apparent . 
To find a sustainable alternative , one need only look to nature , where nothing is wasted . 
Forests , for example , are completely efficient systems , with species &quot; lifecycles occurring in perfect harmony with the seasons . 
This underpins levels of resilience and longevity that economic systems should strive to emulate . 
Just as ecosystems reuse everything in an efficient and purposeful cycle , a &quot; circular &quot; economic system would ensure that products were designed to be part of a value network , within which the reuse and refurbishment of products , components , and materials would ensure the continual re-exploitation of resources . 
Of course , building a circular economy would require a fundamental restructuring of global value chains . 
Instead of selling products , businesses would retain ownership , selling the use of the goods they make as a service . 
Selling a product &apos;s benefits instead of the product itself would create a powerful incentive for producers to design for longevity , repeated reuse , and eventual recycling , which would enable them to optimize their use of resources . 
This requires a new generation of materials , as well as innovative development and production processes . 
It also demands new business models , a redefined concept of legal ownership and use , new public-tendering rules , and novel financing strategies . 
Finally , a circular economy calls for adaptive logistics and a leadership culture that embraces the new system and rewards progress toward establishing it . 
Beyond the moral imperative , there is a strong financial argument in favor of the transition to a circular economy - namely , the promise of over $ 1 trillion in business opportunities . 
This includes material savings , increased productivity , new jobs , and possibly new product and business categories . 
But businesses cannot transform the economy alone . 
In order to shift firms &quot; emphasis from minimizing initial costs to maximizing total value , while ensuring the protection of people &apos;s health and well-being , governments should change their tendering processes by implementing requirements for circularity , thereby helping to drive demand for new solutions . 
At the same time , consumers must be open to using products that they do not own . 
Because the circular economy is inherently systemic , it can succeed only if all stakeholders co-design , co-create , and co-own products and services . 
With this in mind , my company is redesigning its products and considering how to capture their residual value . 
At the same time , it is shifting from a transaction- to a relationship-based business model - one that entails closer cooperation with customers and suppliers . 
And it is changing its corporate culture to emphasize long-term solutions . 
None of these changes is easy to implement , but all of them are necessary . 
Like all major transitions in human history , the shift from a linear to a circular economy will be a tumultuous one . 
It will feature pioneers and naysayers , victories and setbacks . 
But , if businesses , governments , and consumers each do their part , the Circular Revolution will put the global economy on a path of sustainable long-term growth - and , 500 years from now , people will look back at it as a revolution of Copernican proportions .
