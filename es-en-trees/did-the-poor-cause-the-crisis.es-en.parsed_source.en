Did the Poor Cause the Crisis ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - The United States continues to be riven by heated debate about the causes of the 2007-2009 financial crisis . 
Is government to blame for what went wrong , and , if so , in what sense ? 
In December , the Republican minority on the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission ( FCIC ) , weighed in with a preemptive dissenting narrative . 
According to this group , misguided government policies , aimed at increasing homeownership among relatively poor people , pushed too many into taking out subprime mortgages that they could not afford . 
This narrative has the potential to gain a great deal of support , particularly in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election . 
But , while the FCIC Republicans write eloquently , do they have any evidence to back up their assertions ? 
Are poor people in the US responsible for causing the most severe global crisis in more than a generation ? 
Not according to Daron Acemoglu of MIT ( and a co-author of mine on other topics ) , who presented his findings at the American Finance Association &apos;s annual meeting in early January . ( The slides are on his MIT Web site . ) 
Acemoglu breaks down the Republican narrative into three distinct questions . 
First , is there evidence that US politicians respond to lower-income voters &quot; preferences or desires ? 
The evidence on this point is not as definitive as one might like , but what we have - for example , from the work of Princeton University &apos;s Larry Bartels - suggests that over the past 50 years , virtually the entire US political elite has stopped sharing the preferences of low- or middle-income voters . 
The views of office holders have moved much closer to those commonly found atop the income distribution . 
There are various theories regarding why this shift occurred . 
In our book 13 Bankers , James Kwak and I emphasized a combination of the rising role of campaign contributions , the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington , and , most of all , an ideological shift towards the view that finance is good , more finance is better , and unfettered finance is best . 
There is a clear corollary : the voices and interests of relatively poor people count for little in American politics . 
Acemoglu &apos;s assessment of recent research on lobbying is that parts of the private sector wanted financial rules to be relaxed - and worked hard and spent heavily to get this outcome . 
The impetus for a big subprime market came from within the private sector : &quot; innovation &quot; by giant mortgage lenders like Countrywide , Ameriquest , and many others , backed by the big investment banks . 
And , to be blunt , it was some of Wall Street &apos;s biggest players , not overleveraged homeowners , who received generous government bailouts in the aftermath of the crisis . 
Acemoglu next asks whether there is evidence that the income distribution in the US worsened in the late 1990 &quot; s , leading politicians to respond by loosening the reins on lending to people who were &quot; falling behind &quot; ? 
Income in the US has , in fact , become much more unequal over the past 40 years , but the timing doesn &apos;t fit this story at all . 
For example , from work that Acemoglu has done with David Autor ( also at MIT ) , we know that incomes for the top 10 % moved up sharply during the 1980 &quot; s . 
Weekly earnings grew slowly for the bottom 50 % and the bottom 10 % at the time , but the lower end of the income distribution actually did relatively well in the second half of the 1990 &quot; s . 
So no one was struggling more than they had been in the run-up to the subprime madness , which came in the early 2000 &quot; s . 
Using data from Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez , Acemoglu also points out that the dynamics of the wage distribution for the top 1 % of US income earners look different . 
As Thomas Philippon and Ariell Reshef have suggested , this group &apos;s sharp increase in earning power appears more related to deregulation of finance ( and perhaps other sectors ) . 
In other words , the big winners from &quot; financial innovation &quot; of all kinds over the past three decades have not been the poor ( or even the middle class ) , but the rich - people already highly paid . 
Finally , Acemoglu examines the role of federal government support for housing . 
To be sure , the US has long provided subsidies to owner-occupied housing - mostly through the tax deduction for mortgage interest . 
But nothing about this subsidy explains the timing of the boom in housing and outlandish mortgage lending . 
The FCIC Republicans point the finger firmly at Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and other government-sponsored enterprises that supported housing loans by providing guarantees of various kinds . 
They are right that Fannie and Freddie were &quot; too big to fail , &quot; which enabled them to borrow more cheaply and take on more risk - with too little equity funding to back up their exposure . 
But , while Fannie and Freddie jumped into dubious mortgages ( particularly those known as Alt-A ) and did some work with subprime lenders , this was relatively small stuff and late in the cycle ( e.g. , 2004-2005 ) . 
The main impetus for the boom came from the entire machinery of &quot; private label &quot; securitization , which was just that : private . 
In fact , as Acemoglu points out , the powerful private-sector players consistently tried to marginalize Fannie and Freddie and exclude them from rapidly expanding market segments . 
The FCIC Republicans are right to place the government at the center of what went wrong . 
But this was not a case of over-regulating and over-reaching . 
On the contrary , 30 years of financial deregulation , made possible by capturing the hearts and minds of regulators , and of politicians on both sides of the aisle , gave a narrow private-sector elite - mostly on Wall Street - almost all the upside of the housing boom . 
The downside was shoved onto the rest of society , particularly the relatively uneducated and underpaid , who now have lost their houses , their jobs , their hopes for their children , or all of the above . 
These people did not cause the crisis . 
But they are paying for it .
