The Price of Peace 
MADRID - The relationship between peace and justice has long been the subject of polarizing debates . 
Some argue that the pursuit of justice impedes conflict-resolution efforts , while others - including International Criminal Court ( ICC ) Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda - contend that justice is a prerequisite for peace . 
As President Juan Manuel Santos leads Colombia through the most promising peace talks in five decades of brutal conflict with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , he will have to consider this question carefully . 
The Nuremberg trials , which followed Nazi Germany &apos;s unconditional surrender in World War II , provide an ideal model for post-conflict justice . 
But , in conflicts in which no side has been defeated , the peacemaker &apos;s job becomes more challenging . 
Since 1945 , more than 500 cases of amnesty in post-conflict transitions have been recorded ; since the 1970 &quot; s , at least 14 states - including Spain , Mozambique , and Brazil - have given amnesty to regimes guilty of serious human-rights violations . 
In South Africa , amnesty was a key feature of the &quot; truth and reconciliation &quot; process that facilitated the peaceful transition from more than four decades of white-minority rule to democracy . 
Similarly , in 2003 , Nigeria &apos;s president offered asylum to his Liberian counterpart , Charles Taylor , on the condition that Taylor retire from politics , thereby helping to end the rebellion against him . 
( In this case , justice was later served ; in 2012 , the Special Court for Sierra Leone convicted Taylor of 11 counts of aiding and abetting war crimes in Sierra Leone , making him the first former head of state to be convicted for such crimes by an international tribunal since Nuremberg . ) 
Although it may be painful to offer a safe exit to war criminals and human-rights abusers , the prospect of ending the suffering of civilians can take priority over a principled stand for justice . 
Who today would oppose amnesty for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad if it ended the brutal civil war that has led to more than 100,000 deaths and created nearly two million refugees ( including more than a million children ) in just two years ? 
This is precisely the dilemma that Santos now faces . 
Given the innumerable atrocities that the FARC have committed , the prospect of suspending punishment is difficult to accept . 
But prolonging a conflict that has already led to more than 200,000 deaths and displaced roughly five million people is in no one &apos;s interest . 
With Colombia &apos;s recent accord on agrarian reform having resolved the conflict &apos;s root cause , the question of transitional justice has become the determining factor in whether the peace process will succeed . 
If impunity for perpetrators of crimes against humanity , however morally repugnant , could protect potential future victims by ending the conflict , accepting such an outcome may well be worth sacrificing a full measure of justice for past victims . 
Rather than launching an uncompromising campaign to defeat the insurgents , Santos has pursued the more politically challenging course : a negotiated settlement . 
This suggests a willingness to do whatever it takes to protect long-suffering rural communities from continued violence . 
Santos would certainly not be the first head of state to go silent on accountability . 
In 2003 , the United States and the European Union acquiesced to an accord that formally ended the Democratic Republic of the Congo &apos;s civil war , which had claimed nearly four million lives , though the agreement lacked provisions to hold war criminals accountable . 
The same is true for Sudan &apos;s 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement , which ended a 22-year civil war in which more than two million died . 
In these cases - as in Colombia today - a fundamentalist approach to transitional justice was not feasible . 
After all , transitional justice is essentially a political solution , a historic contract of national reconciliation - not a strictly judicial matter . 
For Santos , reconciling peace and justice in a complicated domestic political context may require alternative formulas , such as reduced sentences , community penalties , conditional verdicts , or asylum in third countries . 
But none of these options , let alone amnesty , should be allowed unless the demobilized insurgents cooperate fully with the courts , including by disclosing all of their crimes . 
Following this logic , FARC leader Pablo Catatumbo has acknowledged the &quot; pain and acts of cruelty &quot; that the guerillas have committed and has requested a collective pardon that would cover human-rights violations committed by both the FARC and state security forces . 
He has also insisted on the identification and compensation of victims as a prerequisite for peace and national reconciliation . 
When conflict-resolution efforts are on the line , a single-minded quest for retribution often is the wrong option . 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu , a leader of South Africa &apos;s democratic transition , has described an alternative - restorative justice - that focuses on &quot; the healing of breaches , the redressing of imbalances , &#91; and &#93; the restoration of broken relationships . &quot; 
With this constructive , forward-looking understanding of justice in mind , Santos , too , can succeed , thereby securing the peaceful , secure future that Colombians deserve .
