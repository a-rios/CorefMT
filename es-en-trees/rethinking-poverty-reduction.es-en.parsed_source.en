Rethinking Poverty Reduction 
NEW YORK - Last year , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization announced that the number of hungry people in the world increased over the last decade . In 2008 , the World Bank announced a significant decline in the number of poor people up to the year 2005 . 
But if poverty is defined principally in terms of the money income needed to avoid hunger , how can announcements such as these be reconciled ? 
According to the World Bank &apos;s much cited &quot; dollar-a-day &quot; international poverty line , which was revised in 2008 to $ 1.25 a day in 2005 prices , there are still 1.4 billion people living in poverty , down from 1.9 billion in 1981 . 
However , as China has accounted for most of this decline , there were at least 100 million more people living in poverty outside China in 2005 than in 1981 . 
In Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia , poverty and hunger remain stubbornly high . 
International agencies estimate that more than 100 million people fell into poverty as a result of higher food prices during 2007-2008 , and that the global financial and economic crisis of 2008-2009 accounted for an increase of another 200 million . 
Delayed job recovery from the global downturn remains a major challenge for poverty reduction in the coming years . 
Meanwhile , measurement controversies continue to cast doubt on actual progress . 
With the 1995 Social Summit adopting a wider definition of poverty that includes deprivation , social exclusion , and lack of participation , the situation today may be even worse than suggested by a money-income poverty line . 
Inequality appears to have been on the rise in recent decades at the international level and in most countries . 
More than 80 % of the world &apos;s population live in countries where income differentials are widening . 
The poorest 40 % of the world &apos;s population account for only 5 % of world income , while the richest 20 % account for 75 % . 
The mixed record of poverty reduction calls into question the efficacy of conventional approaches . 
Countries were advised to abandon their national development strategies in favor of globalization , market liberalization , and privatization . 
Instead of producing sustained rapid growth and economic stability , such policies made countries more vulnerable to the power of the rich and the vagaries of international finance and global instability , which has become more frequent and severe due to deregulation . 
The most important lesson is the need for sustained rapid growth and structural economic transformation . 
Governments need to play a developmental role , with implementation of integrated policies designed to support inclusive output and employment growth , as well as to reduce inequality and promote social justice . 
Such an approach needs to be complemented by appropriate industrial investment and technology policies , and by inclusive financial facilities designed to support them . 
In addition , new and potentially viable production capacities need to be fostered through complementary developmental policies . 
By contrast , the insistence on minimal government and reliance on the market led to precipitous declines in public infrastructure investment , particularly in agriculture . 
But none of these economies had pursued wholesale economic liberalization . 
Structural transformations should promote full and productive employment as well as decent work , while governments should have enough policy and fiscal space to enable them to play a proactive role and to provide adequate universal social protection . 
The last three decades also saw the divorce of social policies from overall development strategies as a consequence of the drive for smaller government . 
National economic development strategies were replaced with donor-favored poverty-reduction programs , such as land-titling , micro-credit , and &quot; bottom of the pyramid &quot; marketing to the poor . 
Such fads have not succeeded in significantly reducing poverty . 
This is not to deny some positive consequences . 
For example , micro-credit has empowered millions of women , while important lessons have been learned from such schemes &quot; design and implementation . 
Meanwhile , universal social programs have improved human welfare much more than targeted and conditional programs . 
However , conditional cash-transfer programs have been quite successful in improving various human-development indicators . 
Unfortunately , poverty remains endemic , with more than a billion people going hungry every day . 
Urgent action is needed , as the recent financial and economic crisis , following hard on the heels of the food-price crisis , is believed to have set back progress on poverty reduction even further . 
There are also growing fears that climate change will more adversely threaten the lives of the poor . 
The United Nations &quot; biennial Report on the World Social Situation ( RWSS 2010 ) , entitled Rethinking Poverty , makes a compelling case for rethinking poverty-measurement and poverty-reduction efforts . 
For the world &apos;s poor , &quot; business as usual &quot; has never been an acceptable option . 
Nor have the popular trends of recent decades proven to be much better . 
There will be no real poverty eradication without equitable and sustainable economic development , which deregulated markets have proved unable to deliver on their own .
