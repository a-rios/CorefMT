Europe , An Engine of Peace 
Critics of European monetary integration often point out that , in the absence of political union , monetary union is doomed to fail . 
I agree with the critics &quot; conclusion , but not with their premise , for the success of the single currency so far has been due precisely to the political commitments of the Union &apos;s member countries . 
In other words , it is not true that the European Union does not constitute a political union . 
European economic integration - in all its aspects - reflects the desire to integrate Europe politically , which , at least in my view , implies that European economic and monetary integration is irreversible . 
This has been true from the outset of the European integration process in 1952 , when six countries established the European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) . 
The aim of the ECSC was explicitly political : to remove control of the two most important raw materials for the production of heavy weaponry from states that had just fought the bloodiest war in history . 
This drive for peace remained , quietly , the key motivation behind further steps toward Europe &apos;s economic integration , which was regarded as the vehicle for achieving political integration . 
In 1951 , French Prime Minister Rene Pléven proposed establishing a European Defense Community ( EDC ) alongside the ECSC . 
He failed , but the idea did not vanish . 
Later that year , Robert Schumann - the French foreign minister at the time and a founding father of European integration - explicitly identified the ECSC with the drive for peace . 
He described it as a means for creating a &quot; fusion of interests ... that will be the leavening from which may grow a wider and deeper community between countries long opposed to one another by bloody conflicts . &quot; 
These words were echoed on the eve of the introduction of the single currency . 
In particular , Germany under Chancellor Helmut Kohl often linked monetary integration with the objective of political union . 
Kohl once referred to the single currency &apos;s success as a matter of &quot; war and peace . &quot; 
For this reason , I do not agree with those who argue that Germany &apos;s support for European monetary integration was the price it paid for Europe &apos;s acceptance of German reunification . 
On the contrary , the historical record shows that Germany made the case for a parallel drive to monetary and political integration well before the fall of the Iron Curtain . 
Of course , there are other motives behind support for economic integration . 
The EU &apos;s leaders are convinced that achieving the so-called four freedoms - i.e. , freedom of movement of goods , services , capital , and people - will optimize the well-being of Europe &apos;s population . 
They also aspire to increase the Continent &apos;s strategic power . 
But peace was the principal driving force in the minds of people like Schumann and Jean Monnet at the beginning of the European integration process , as it was for Helmut Schmidt and Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing when they laid the foundations of the single currency and today &apos;s European Central Bank . 
For half a century , the process of European integration proceeded - sometimes with setbacks , sometimes with giant steps forward - joining formerly separate markets by creating very close trade relations . 
Over time , this stimulated ever-greater economic convergence . 
Of course , Europe &apos;s economies have not become &quot; look-alikes , &quot; nor has GDP per capita been fully equalized . 
Understanding this history is vital , because Europe &apos;s Union once again stands at a threshold : should it keep its promise to start membership talks with Turkey ? 
In the wake of the defeat of the EU &apos;s Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands this spring , many say that Europe &apos;s decade-old promise cannot and should not be kept . 
What strikes me as dangerous is that the issue of peace - the motor that has driven European integration from the start - rarely comes up in the debate about what to do in the wake of these events . 
On the contrary , responsible statesmen and party leaders have come out openly against Turkish membership . 
I would have hoped that these people had learned from Schumann and Monnet what really matters for Europe and its future ; sadly , this does not seem to be the case . 
Of course , I do not fear some sort of military clash between Turkey and the EU . 
After all , Turkey has been and remains a loyal member of NATO . 
For me , Europe &apos;s integration of Muslim Turkey into its political union is the same sort of question of peace that Schumann and Monnet successfully confronted . 
Today , Europe needs peace between cultures as much as it once needed peace between nations , and it is for this reason that we must welcome Turkey into our midst .
