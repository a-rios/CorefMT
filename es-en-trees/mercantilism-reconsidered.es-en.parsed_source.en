Mercantilism Reconsidered 
CAMBRIDGE - A businessman walks into a government minister &apos;s office and says he needs help . 
What should the minister do ? 
Invite him in for a cup of coffee and ask how the government can be of help ? 
Or throw him out , on the principle that government should not be handing out favors to business ? 
This question constitutes a Rorschach test for policymakers and economists . 
On one side are free-market enthusiasts and neo-classical economists , who believe in a stark separation between state and business . 
In their view , the government &apos;s role is to establish clear rules and regulations and then let businesses sink or swim on their own . 
Public officials should hold private interests at arm &apos;s length and never cozy up to them . 
It is consumers , not producers , who are king . 
This view reflects a venerable tradition that goes back to Adam Smith and continues a proud existence in today &apos;s economics textbooks . 
It is also the dominant perspective of governance in the United States , Britain , and other societies organized along Anglo-American lines - even though actual practice often deviates from idealized principles . 
On the other side are what we may call corporatists or neo-mercantilists , who view an alliance between government and business as critical to good economic performance and social harmony . 
In this model , the economy needs a state that eagerly lends an ear to business , and , when necessary , greases the wheels of commerce by providing incentives , subsidies , and other discretionary benefits . 
Because investment and job creation ensure economic prosperity , the objective of government policy should be to make producers happy . 
Rigid rules and distant policymakers merely suffocate the animal spirits of the business class . 
This view reflects an even older tradition that goes back to the mercantilist practices of the seventeenth century . 
Mercantilists believed in an active economic role for the state - to promote exports , discourage finished imports , and establish trade monopolies that would enrich business and the crown alike . 
This idea survives today in the practices of Asian export superpowers ( most notably China ) . 
Adam Smith and his followers decisively won the intellectual battle between these two models of capitalism . 
The growth champions of the past few decades - Japan in the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s , South Korea from the 1960 &quot; s to the 1980 &quot; s , and China since the early 1980 &quot; s - have all had activist governments collaborating closely with large business . 
All aggressively promoted investment and exports while discouraging ( or remaining agnostic about ) imports . 
China &apos;s pursuit of a high-saving , large-trade-surplus economy in recent years embodies mercantilist teachings . 
Early mercantilism deserves a rethink too . 
It is doubtful that the great expansion of intercontinental trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries would have been possible without the incentives that states provided , such as monopoly charters . 
As many economic historians argue , the trade networks and profits that mercantilism provided for Britain may have been critical in launching the country &apos;s industrial revolution around the middle of the eighteenth century . 
None of this is to idealize mercantilist practices , whose harmful effects are easy to see . 
Governments can too easily end up in the pockets of business , resulting in cronyism and rent-seeking instead of economic growth . 
Even when initially successful , government intervention in favor of business can outlive its usefulness and become ossified . 
The pursuit of trade surpluses inevitably triggers conflicts with trade partners , and the effectiveness of mercantilist policies depends in part on the absence of similar policies elsewhere . 
Moreover , unilateral mercantilism is no guarantee of success . 
The Chinese-US trade relationship may have seemed like a marriage made in heaven - between practitioners of the mercantilist and liberal models , respectively - but in hindsight it is clear that it merely led to a blowup . 
As a result , China will have to make important changes to its economic strategy , a necessity for which it has yet to prepare itself . 
Nonetheless , the mercantilist mindset provides policymakers with some important advantages : better feedback about the constraints and opportunities that private economic activity faces , and the ability to create a sense of national purpose around economic goals . 
There is much that liberals can learn from it . 
Indeed , the inability to see the advantages of close state-business relations is the blind spot of modern economic liberalism . 
Just look at how the search for the causes of the financial crisis has played out in the US . 
For textbook liberals , the state should have kept its distance , acting purely as Platonic guardians of consumer sovereignty . 
But the problem is not that government listened too much to Wall Street ; rather , the problem is that it didn &apos;t listen enough to Main Street , where the real producers and innovators were . 
That is how untested economic theories about efficient markets and self-regulation could substitute for common sense , enabling financial interests to gain hegemony , while leaving everyone else , including governments , to pick up the pieces .
