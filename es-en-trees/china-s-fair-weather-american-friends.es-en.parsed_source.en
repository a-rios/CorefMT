China &apos;s Fair-Weather American Friends 
MUNICH - Because China has pegged its undervalued currency , the renminbi , to the dollar , every weakening of the dollar in the wake of America &apos;s financial crisis has also meant a weakening of the renminbi vis-Ã -vis other world currencies . 
But is China really to blame for the eruption of a global currency war ? 
The central banks of South Korea , Brazil , Taiwan , Japan , Switzerland , and many other countries are now buying dollars in order to protect their own currencies against revaluation and thus to defend their exports . 
Europe also became nervous after the euro exchange rate rose to more than $ 1.40 , far beyond the purchasing power parity ( PPP ) rate of $ 1.17 . 
The United States is now taking drastic steps against China , and is making provisions for a trade war . 
Congress has authorized the President to impose import duties on Chinese products if China remains unwilling to increase the value of its currency substantially against the dollar . 
But the undervaluation of the renminbi , which is currently 45 % , has persisted for many years . 
So why is the US suddenly acting so aggressively ? 
Why didn &apos;t America take action much earlier ? 
The reason lies in capital movements . 
The US accepted the lower valuation of the renminbi as long as China returned the dollars that it earned from bilateral merchandise trade by financing America &apos;s budget deficit . 
Now that the Chinese prefer to invest that money in raw materials in Africa and elsewhere , they have aroused the full ire of American policymakers . 
China &apos;s shift has been dramatic . 
In 2008 and 2009 , the Chinese purchased US government bonds at a rate of $ 17 billion a month . 
But China reversed course in November 2009 . 
During the first seven months of 2010 , China not only refrained from buying any more US government paper , but even began to sell its holdings . 
Each month , China sold a net sum of about $ 7 billion in US government bonds . 
That nerves are now on end in America is perfectly understandable . 
The City of London has jumped into the breach , increasing its purchases , which in 2008 and 2009 amounted to only about $ 1 billion monthly , to an average of $ 28 billion in the first seven months of this year . 
Since the United Kingdom itself is a large capital importer , we can assume that the City is not holding the paper itself but merely restructuring it and then selling it to the world under a new name and with the London stamp on it . 
Despite its withdrawal from financing the US government , China remains the world &apos;s largest net capital exporter , a position that it has held since 2006.In2007 and 2008 , China exported on average about $ 400 billion of capital annually . 
The US , which at the time needed annual capital imports of $ 800 billion in order to offset the near total cessation of private savings , received the lion &apos;s share of this capital . 
The unwillingness of the Chinese to consume enabled Americans to build new houses for many years on borrowed money and to maintain a level of consumption that the US economy was unable to finance on its own . 
To be sure , the Chinese always restrained themselves from private real-estate financing in the US . 
They bought only government paper and securitized real-estate instruments that were issued by the semi-public bodies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
Direct real-estate finance via private channels came mainly from other countries - Germany , for example . 
Nevertheless , China helped the US to achieve a higher standard of living by making money available to government authorities that would otherwise have had to come from American taxpayers . 
Given this history , it is a bit shabby to reproach China now for its exchange-rate policy - a policy that enabled the US to live beyond its means for so long . 
Rather than coming at the expense of the US , as is constantly claimed , it was the renminbi &apos;s low valuation that allowed Americans to dream their American dream of universal homeownership . 
Imports of inexpensive Chinese products freed up capital and labor in the US for a dramatic expansion of the housing stock - which led to a sharp rise in the American standard of living . 
It is understandable that the Chinese are now reluctant to invest more money in the US . 
They tried to enter the US energy market with the purchase of Unocal , but were blocked by politicians . 
Other direct investments were also stopped by Congress on the pretext of national security . 
One need only recall the bidding for Emcore or Firstgold . 
The US wanted the Chinese money , but it was not prepared to offer anything more than structured securities of questionable creditworthiness , as well as government paper that is now clearly exposed to the risk of inflation and devaluation . 
It would be a service to world peace if the US stopped making cheap moral accusations against China . 
The truth is much more subtle than naked political interest .
