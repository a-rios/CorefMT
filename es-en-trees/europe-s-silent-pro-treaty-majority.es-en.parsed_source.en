Europe &apos;s Silent Pro-Treaty Majority 
At the European Union &apos;s coming EU summit , debate will center on whether to go forward with a &quot; mini &quot; EU Constitutional Treaty . 
That debate is the result of the rejection of the draft treaty by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . 
Luxembourg &apos;s voters , for example , approved it by a 56.5 % majority immediately after the Dutch and French no votes . 
Indeed , with two-thirds of member states and a majority of European citizens supporting the Treaty , it cannot simply be abandoned . 
At the same time , French and Dutch citizens &quot; voices cannot be ignored - all the more so because it is unimaginable that an identical text could be submitted to a second referendum in either country . 
Because all 27 states must ratify the Treaty , it therefore seems obvious that it cannot enter into force in its current form , and that the &quot; yes &quot; countries cannot push ahead with it unchanged . 
But it is equally impossible to start from scratch . 
So we must try to reconcile the &quot; yes &quot; and &quot; no &quot; countries if we are to overcome the crisis into which Europe has been plunged . 
And we need to do so quickly if the EU is to deliver on its citizens &quot; expectations . 
This is because Europe faces many complex challenges in a globalized world . 
It is also obvious that member states cannot solve these problems alone , but only through coordinated EU action and common policies . 
This does not mean that enlarging the EU &apos;s competencies should be the aim at any cost . 
In fact , the Constitutional Treaty defines more clearly which competencies should be shared between the EU and its member states , and how . 
It also reinforces the principle of subsidiarity by giving a stronger say to national parliaments . 
So the objective is not automatically &quot; more Europe , &quot; but rather a &quot; better Europe &quot; capable of acting effectively and more transparently in areas where collective action is clearly necessary . 
For all these reasons , the institutional reforms that are contained in the constitutional treaty are still urgently needed . 
If Europe is to fulfill its role as a major global actor , its scope cannot be limited to that of a large common market . 
It must be an integrated economic , political , and social force . 
In order to realize the full potential of the common market , the EU must adapt its economic governance to the challenges of globalization - research , technological development , and knowledge must be at the heart of the European economy , particularly given Europe &apos;s efforts to be at the forefront of combating climate change . 
It also needs to speak with one voice on matters of foreign policy in order to play a more important international role in solving major conflicts and shaping a more peaceful and balanced world order . 
Finally , the EU needs to promote social cohesion while adapting Europe &apos;s social model to globalization &apos;s challenges . 
It is no exaggeration to say that a large majority of member states and their citizens has already expressed its wish for this vision of the EU by voting for the Constitutional Treaty . 
At a meeting convened by Spain and Luxembourg in Madrid in January to which all the &quot; yes &quot; countries were invited , this view was also supported by four other member states that are committed to the constitutional treaty . 
It may well be impossible to press ahead with the Treaty without any changes to the text . 
However , the Madrid meeting made clear that there is a consensus among these member states in favor of a Europe that can play a key role in our globalized world , and whose actions are based on the principles - effectiveness , transparency , and democracy - that inspire the European integration process . 
The solution to the impasse over Europe &apos;s Constitutional Treaty certainly does not lie in the direction of diminishing its scope , and thus perhaps making it just an &quot; ordinary &quot; treaty . 
Minimalist solutions respond to neither the expectations of the citizens nor the requirements of a rapidly changing world . 
The answer is more likely to be found in the Treaty &apos;s simplification , taking out those elements that are not absolutely necessary , and also enriching it in such areas as climate change . 
The EU &apos;s German Presidency , which I know shares the &quot; ambitious &quot; view of the Treaty , is working hard on finding a way out of the deadlock at this month &apos;s European Council . 
Those countries that have stepped forward as &quot; friends of the Constitution &quot; have also been making clear that the initiative they launched in Madrid will support the German Presidency &apos;s efforts . 
If not all the EU &apos;s members are ready to take this path , flexible solutions of the sort that have been a feature of European compromise in the past may be needed . 
By all means , let us try to preserve the solidarity of all 27 EU states . 
Differentiation should not mean division , but rather progress at variable speeds .
