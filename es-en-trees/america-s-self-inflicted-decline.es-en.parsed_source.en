America &apos;s Self-Inflicted Decline 
MELBOURNE - If the broad post-World War II prosperity that has endured for six decades comes to an end , both the United States and Europe will be responsible . 
With rare exceptions , politics has become a discredited profession throughout the West . 
Tomorrow is always treated as more important than next week , and next week prevails over next year , with no one seeking to secure the long-term future . 
Now the West is paying the price . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s instincts may be an exception here , but he is fighting powerful hidebound forces in the United States , as well as a demagogic populism , in the form of the Tea Party , that is far worse - and that might defeat him in 2012 , seriously damaging America in the process . 
America &apos;s friends around the world watched with dismay the recent brawl in over raising the federal government &apos;s debt ceiling , and the US Congress &apos;s inability to come to anything like a balanced and forward-looking compromise . 
On the contrary , the outcome represents a significant victory for the Tea Party &apos;s minions , whose purpose seems to be to reduce government obligations and expenditures to a bare minimum ( some object even to having a central bank ) , and to maintain President George W. Bush &apos;s outrageous tax breaks for the wealthy . 
America &apos;s current fiscal problems are rooted in a long period of unfunded spending . 
Bush &apos;s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and the manner in which he conducted the &quot; global war on terror &quot; made matters much worse , contributing to a totally unsustainable situation . 
Indeed , Obama inherited an almost impossible legacy . 
In the weeks since the debt ceiling agreement , it has become increasingly clear that good government might be impossible in the US . 
The example of recent weeks gives us no cause for optimism that US legislators will rise above partisan politics and ask themselves what is best for America . 
In these circumstances , it is not surprising that financial markets have returned to extreme volatility . 
The expenditure cuts mandated by the outcome of the debt-ceiling debate will reduce economic activity , thereby undermining growth and making debt reduction even more difficult . 
Providing further fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth would carry its own risks , owing to the debt ceiling and another , more ominous factor : America is already overly indebted , and there are signs that major holders of US government securities are finally tired of being repaid in depreciated currency . 
Most importantly , China &apos;s call for the introduction of a new reserve currency stems from its frustration with the failure of major governments - whether in the US or Europe - to govern their economic affairs with realism and good sense . 
China recognizes that America is in great difficulty ( indeed , it recognizes this more clearly than the US itself ) , and that , given the poisonous political atmosphere prevailing in Washington , there will be no easy return to good government , economic stability , and strong growth . 
America &apos;s leadership in world affairs began to weaken with the unilateralism of Bush , and today &apos;s economic problems are reinforcing this tendency . 
To reverse America &apos;s decline , Obama needs bipartisan support for his ( quite mainstream ) policies , but so far the US Congress has shown no stomach for a principled approach to its legislative duties . 
If Germany &apos;s half-hearted efforts to stabilize Europe somehow turn out to be successful , America &apos;s position will be further eroded , and central banks around the world will begin to regard the euro once again as a reliable alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency . 
The alternative , as China has suggested , would be to develop a new reserve currency . 
These realities represent a power shift of a kind that we have not experienced in our lifetimes . 
China &apos;s economic power over the US is now substantial , and will limit not only America &apos;s influence in the financial markets , but also its capacity to use military power . 
If this forces America back towards what the international-relations scholar Joseph Nye calls &quot; soft power and multilateral diplomacy , &quot; it may well be a good thing . 
But such approaches are anathema to the US Republican Party , and to its Tea Party faction in particular , and they might unnerve the many Asians who are nervous at China &apos;s growing military might . 
The counter-argument - that any sell-off or failure by China to continue to buy US government securities would hurt China as much as America - is not valid . 
As each year passes , China &apos;s markets expand worldwide , and its domestic market comes to represent a greater percentage of its own GDP . 
As a result , China will not need a strong dollar in the long term . 
Americans need to get their economic house in order before China loses its incentive to support the dollar . 
On several occasions in the post-WWII period , the US has learned with great pain that there are limits to the effective use of military power . 
American objectives could not be achieved in Vietnam . 
The outcome in Iraq will not be determined until the last American troops have been withdrawn . 
In Afghanistan , where withdrawal dates have already been set , it is difficult to believe that a cohesive unified state can be established . 
As the efficacy of military power is reduced , so the importance of economic power grows . 
Recognition of these central realities - and bipartisanship in addressing them - is critical for America &apos;s future , and that of the West .
