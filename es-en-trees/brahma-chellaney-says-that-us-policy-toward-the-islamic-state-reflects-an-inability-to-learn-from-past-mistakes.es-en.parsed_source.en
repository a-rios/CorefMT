America &apos;s Never-Ending War 
NEW DELHI - It is official : US President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Barack Obama is at war again . 
After toppling Libyan ruler Muammar el-Qaddafi and bombing targets in Somalia and Yemen , Obama has initiated airstrikes in the Syria-Iraq belt , effectively declaring war on the Islamic State - a decision that will involve infringing on the sovereign , if disintegrating , state of Syria . 
In his zeal to intervene , Obama is again disregarding US and international law by seeking approval from neither the US Congress nor the United Nations Security Council . 
Obama &apos;s predecessor , George W. Bush , launched America &apos;s so-called &quot; war on terror &quot; to defeat groups that he insisted wanted to &quot; establish a radical Islamic empire that spans from Spain to Indonesia . &quot; 
But Bush &apos;s invasion and occupation of Iraq was so controversial that it fractured the global consensus to fight terror , with the Guant√°namo Bay detention center and the rendition and torture of suspects coming to symbolize the war &apos;s excesses . 
After Obama took office , he sought to introduce a gentler , subtler tone . 
Contending in a 2009 interview that &quot; the language we use matters , &quot; he rebranded the war on terror as a &quot; struggle &quot; and a &quot; strategic challenge . &quot; 
But the rhetorical shift did not translate into a change in strategy , with the Obama administration moving beyond security concerns to use its anti-terrorism activities to advance America &apos;s broader geopolitical interests . 
Thus , instead of viewing the elimination of Osama bin Laden in 2011 as the culmination of the anti-terror &quot; struggle &quot; that Bush launched , the Obama administration increased aid to &quot; good &quot; rebels ( such as those in Libya ) , while pursuing &quot; bad &quot; terrorists more vehemently , including through a &quot; targeted killing &quot; program . 
When it comes to terrorist activity , however , such lines are difficult to draw . 
For example , Obama initially placed the Islamic State in the &quot; good &quot; category , as it undermined Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s rule and Iran &apos;s interests in Syria and Iraq . 
His position changed only after the Islamic State threatened to overrun Iraq &apos;s Kurdish regional capital , Erbil - home to US military , intelligence , diplomatic , and business facilities . 
Add to that the beheadings of two American journalists , and suddenly Obama &apos;s team was using Bush &apos;s war rhetoric , declaring that the US is at war with the Islamic State &quot; in the same way that we are at war with Al Qaeda and its affiliates all around the globe . &quot; 
America &apos;s war on terror now risks becoming a permanent war against an expanding list of enemies - often inadvertently created by its own policies . 
Just as covert aid to Afghanistan &apos;s anti-Soviet rebels in the 1980s contributed to Al Qaeda &apos;s emergence - something that Hillary Clinton acknowledged when she was Obama &apos;s secretary of state - the help that the US and its allies provided to Syrian insurgents after they emerged in 2011 contributed to the rise of the Islamic State . 
The US returned to Afghanistan in 2001 to wage an as-yet-unfinished war on the jihadists whom its actions had spawned . 
Likewise , it is now launching a war in Iraq and Syria against the offspring of Bush &apos;s forced regime change in Baghdad and Obama &apos;s ill-conceived plan to topple Assad . 
It is time for the US to recognize that since it launched its war on terror , the scourge has only spread . 
The Afghanistan-Pakistan belt has remained &quot; ground zero &quot; for transnational terrorism , and once-stable countries like Libya , Iraq , and Syria have emerged as new hubs . 
Obama &apos;s effort to strike a Faustian bargain with the Afghan Taliban , whose top leaders enjoy sanctuary in Pakistan , indicates that he is more interested in confining terrorism to the Middle East than defeating it - even if it means leaving India to bear the brunt of terrorist activity . 
( In fact , Pakistan &apos;s ongoing war of terror against India also sprang from America &apos;s anti-Soviet operation in Afghanistan - the largest in the CIA &apos;s history - as the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence siphoned off a large share of the billions of dollars in military aid for the Afghan rebels . ) 
Similarly , Obama &apos;s strategy toward the Islamic State seeks merely to limit the reach of a barbaric medieval order . 
Moments after declaring his intention to &quot; degrade and destroy &quot; the group , Obama responded to a reporter &apos;s request for clarification by stating that his real goal is to turn the Islamic State into a &quot; manageable problem . &quot; 
Making matters worse , Obama plans to use the same tactics to fight the Islamic State that led to its emergence : authorizing the CIA , aided by some of the region &apos;s oil sheikhdoms , to train and arm thousands of Syrian rebels . 
It is not difficult to see the risks inherent in flooding the Syrian killing fields with even more and better-armed fighters . 
The US may have some of the world &apos;s top think tanks and most highly educated minds . 
But it consistently ignores the lessons of its past blunders - and so repeats them . 
US-led policies toward the Islamic world have prevented a clash between civilizations only by fueling a clash within a civilization that has fundamentally weakened regional and international security . 
An endless war waged on America &apos;s terms against the enemies that it helped to create is unlikely to secure either steady international support or lasting results . 
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the tepid Arab and Turkish response to America &apos;s effort to assemble an international coalition in support of what the Obama administration admits will be a multiyear military offensive against the Islamic State . 
The risk that imperial hubris accelerates , rather than stems , Islamist terror is all too real - yet again .
