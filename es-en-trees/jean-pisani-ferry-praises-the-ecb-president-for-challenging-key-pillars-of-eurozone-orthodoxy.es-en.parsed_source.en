Europe According to Draghi 
PARIS - Central bankers are often proud to be boring . 
Not Mario Draghi . 
Two years ago , in July 2012 , Draghi , the president of the European Central Bank , took everyone by surprise by announcing that he would do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to save the euro . 
The effect was dramatic . 
This August , he used the annual gathering of top central bankers in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , to drop another bomb . 
Draghi &apos;s speech this time was more analytical but no less bold . 
First , he took a side in the ongoing debate about the appropriate policy response to the eurozone &apos;s current stagnation . 
He emphasized that , along with structural reforms , support for aggregate demand is needed , and that the risk of doing too little in this respect clearly exceeded the risk of doing too much . 
Second , he confirmed that the ECB was ready to do its part to boost aggregate demand , and mentioned asset purchases , or quantitative easing , as a necessary tool in a context in which inflation expectations have declined below the official 2 % target . 
Third , and to the surprise of most , Draghi added that there was scope for a more expansionary fiscal stance in the eurozone as a whole . 
For the first time , he expressed the view that the eurozone had suffered from the lower availability and effectiveness of fiscal policy relative to the United States , the United Kingdom , and Japan . 
He attributed this not to pre-existing high public debts , but to the fact that the ECB could not act as a backstop for government funding and spare fiscal authorities the loss of market confidence . 
Moreover , he called for a discussion among euro members of the eurozone &apos;s overall fiscal stance . 
Draghi broke three taboos at once . 
First , he based his reasoning on the heterodox notion of a policy mix combining monetary and fiscal measures . 
Second , he explicitly mentioned the aggregate fiscal stance , whereas Europe has always looked at the fiscal situation exclusively on a country-by-country basis . 
Third , his claim that preventing the ECB from acting as a lender of last resort imposes a high price - making governments vulnerable and reducing their fiscal space - contradicts the tenet that the central bank must not provide support to government borrowing . 
The fact that Draghi chose to confront the orthodoxy at a moment when the ECB needs support for its own initiatives is indicative of his concern over the economic situation in the eurozone . 
His message is that the policy system as it currently works is not suited to the challenges that Europe faces , and that further policy and institutional changes are necessary . 
The issue now is whether - and , if so , how - conceptual boldness will translate into policy action . 
There is less and less doubt regarding the benefits of outright asset purchases by the ECB . 
What was long regarded as too unconventional to be contemplated has gradually become a matter of consensus . 
It will be operationally difficult , because the ECB , unlike the Federal Reserve , cannot rely on a unified , liquid bond market , and its effectiveness remains uncertain . 
But it will most likely take place . 
At the same time , there is little doubt that fiscal policy will fall short of Draghi &apos;s wishes . 
There is no agreement in Europe on the concept of a common fiscal stance , and the backstop that the ECB could provide to sovereigns can be offered only to countries that commit themselves to a negotiated set of policies . 
Even this conditional support within the framework of the ECB &apos;s so-called outright monetary transactions ( OMT ) program has been opposed by Germany &apos;s Bundesbank and constitutional court . 
Draghi &apos;s initiative on this front should thus be interpreted not only as a call for action , but also - and perhaps even more so - as a call for reflection on the future approach to eurozone policymaking . 
The question is this : How can the eurozone define and implement a common fiscal policy without having a common budget ? 
International experience shows that voluntary coordination is of little help . 
What happened in 2009 was a rare exception ; shocks like that which followed the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy - sudden , strongly adverse , and highly symmetric - come once in decades . 
At the time , all countries faced essentially the same issue , and all shared the same concern that the global economy could slide into a depression . 
Europe &apos;s problem today , though serious , is different : a significant subset of countries does not have fiscal space to act and would therefore be unable to support demand . 
And , though Germany is doing much better than anyone else and has fiscal space , it does not wish to use it to benefit its neighbors . 
If joint fiscal action is to be undertaken , a specific mechanism would be needed to trigger it . 
One could think of a joint decision procedure that would , under certain conditions , require budget laws to be approved by the national parliament and a majority of partner countries ( or the European Parliament ) . 
Or one could think of a mechanism inspired by the &quot; tradable deficits permits &quot; imagined by Alessandra Casella of Columbia University . 
In this scenario , countries would be allocated a deficit permit consistent with the desired aggregate stance , but would be free to trade them ; a country willing to post a lower deficit thus could cede its permit to another one willing to post a higher deficit . 
In this way , the aggregate stance could be achieved while accommodating national preferences . 
Any mechanism of this sort raises a host of questions . 
But the fact that the official in charge of the euro is raising the issue indicates that the common currency &apos;s architecture remains in flux . 
A few months ago , the consensus was that the time for redesigning the euro had passed , and that the eurozone would have to live with the architecture inherited from its crisis-driven reforms . 
Not anymore . 
It may take time before agreement is reached and decisions are made , but the discussion is bound to resume . 
That is good news .
