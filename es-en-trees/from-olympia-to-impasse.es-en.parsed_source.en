From Olympia to Impasse 
PARIS - &quot; Do not mix sports and politics ! &quot; 
That defiant cry from China &apos;s rulers to the threat of a boycott of this summer &apos;s Beijing Olympic Games does not stand the test of reality . 
Sport and politics have always been closely linked . 
Obvious examples abound . 
The 1936 Berlin Olympics were dominated as much by Nazi propaganda as by the athletic events . 
During the Cold War , &quot; ping pong diplomacy &quot; helped revive official relations between China and the United States . 
In 1990 , Germany fielded a single Olympic team before the country reunified . 
To claim that politics and sports can be any more separated in today &apos;s media age than they were in the past is especially na√Øve . 
The Olympics were awarded to Beijing for a mixture of economic and political reasons , and China wanted the Games for the same reasons . 
The current tension between China and ( mostly ) Western public opinion on the eve of the Beijing Olympics is the result of incompetence , hypocrisy , and legitimate but potentially counterproductive indignation . 
China &apos;s incompetence in its treatment of the crisis in Tibet should come as no surprise . 
The Chinese regime is , quite simply , a victim of its inability to reform itself . 
China saw in the Olympics a symbolic opportunity to consolidate and celebrate its new status in the world . 
Caught by surprise in Tibet , and by the virulence and popularity of what they described as &quot; anti-Chinese &quot; sentiments , China &apos;s rulers have resorted to the traditional tools of authoritarian regimes , turning their citizens &quot; deep nationalism and sense of humiliation against Western critics . 
The Chinese today sound almost as stunned by the supposed mistreatment of the Olympic torch in London , Paris , and San Francisco as Americans were back in 2001 : &quot; Why do they hate us so much ? &quot; 
&quot; What have we done to them ? &quot; 
Self-isolated from global political realities and incapable of grasping the meaning of &quot; civil society , &quot; the Chinese regime encourages its public in expressions of defiance of all who fail to &quot; respect China , &quot; which only reinforces negative reactions . 
But the West &apos;s hypocrisy nearly matches the Chinese regime &apos;s incompetence . The moment the international community &quot; bestowed &quot; the Olympics on China , the West demonstrated how little consideration it actually gives to human rights and democracy . 
The idea that the Chinese regime would quickly reform the country into an open , moderate , and benevolent giant was either a fraud , a gigantic misperception , or wishful thinking . 
The dilemma posed by China for democratic regimes is understandable . 
Caught between their desperate need for finance and markets and their need to respond to their citizens &quot; sentiments , they oscillate between condemnation and reassurance of China , struggling to find a coherent path that defends the West &apos;s principles without damaging its economic interests . 
Now the West believes that it has found a &quot; third way &quot; by threatening to boycott the Olympics &quot; opening ceremony , but not the Games themselves . 
Thus , the Chinese people , the world &apos;s athletes , and a planet hungry for &quot; bread and circuses &quot; will not be deprived , and China &apos;s rulers will not &quot; get away with murder &quot; in their contempt for human rights and international public opinion . 
The problem is that such a choice requires governments &quot; absolute determination to stand by their words . 
The power of indignation is a necessary component of a transparent and interdependent world that has lost the privilege of ignorance . 
China , for both good and bad , is a status-quo power that does not want to rock the boat of the international system - a power largely satisfied with its new status , but one that does not want to see its regime transformed , especially through external pressures . 
Let us have no illusions : no &quot; conditions &quot; imposed from outside will bring about the &quot; China we deserve &quot; in the way , after World War II , we got the &quot; Germany we deserved &quot; through a process of integration and reconciliation . 
If the Chinese reform their political system and improve their human rights record , it will not be the result of anything we in the West say or do , but because they realize that the absence of the rule of law jeopardizes their long-term ambition to be strong and respected .
