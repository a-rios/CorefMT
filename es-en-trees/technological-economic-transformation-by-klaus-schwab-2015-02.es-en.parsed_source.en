The Age of Adaptation 
GENEVA - The world needs to stop looking backward . 
Since the 2008 financial crisis , we have wasted far too much energy trying to return to the days of rapid economic expansion . 
The flawed assumption that the post-crisis world &apos;s challenges were only temporary has underpinned policies that have yielded only lackluster recoveries , while failing to address key problems like high unemployment and rising inequality . 
The post-crisis era is over , and the &quot; post-post-crisis world &quot; is upon us . 
It is time to adopt a new framework of realistic solutions that promote shared prosperity within the global economy of today and tomorrow . 
In this new era , economic growth will occur more slowly - but potentially more sustainably - than it did before the crisis . 
Indeed , just as the Industrial Revolution transformed the productive potential of societies in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , a new wave of technological breakthroughs is reshaping economic and even social dynamics today . 
The difference is that this revolution &apos;s impact will be even greater . 
One outstanding feature of this revolution is the scope and scale of its disruptiveness . 
The Industrial Revolution occurred relatively slowly , like long waves in the ocean ; though it began in the 1780s , its impact was not really felt until the 1830s and 1840s . 
The current technological revolution , by contrast , hits economies like a tsunami , with little warning and inexorable force . 
The pace of change has been accelerated by the interconnected nature of today &apos;s world . 
Technological progress is occurring within a complex and deeply integrated ecosystem , meaning that it simultaneously affects economic structures , governments , security arrangements , and people &apos;s daily lives . 
In order to prepare a country to reap the benefits of rapid , far-reaching change , policymakers must account for the entirety of the ecosystem in which it is taking place , ensuring that government , business , and society all adjust to every shift . 
In other words , competing in the twenty-first century economy will require relentless adaptation . 
Nothing is off limits . 
Every practice and standard will have to be rethought . 
Every industry will be at risk of being turned on its head . 
The car-sharing service Uber , for example , has not only changed how people get around ; it also appears to be leading a retail revolution in which goods and services are &quot; Uberized &quot; - customers pay to use them , not own them . 
The manufacturing industry , meanwhile , will be similarly transformed by 3D printing technology . 
Supply chains will be eliminated or reshaped - an expectation that the CEO of a major aluminum manufacturer recently described . 
He knows that , in order to succeed , firms will have to anticipate and respond to such trends . 
Gone are the days of big fish eating small fish . 
In the post-post-crisis world , fast fish will dominate - and slow fish will die . 
But the current technological revolution is not just reshaping what we produce and how we produce it ; it is fundamentally reshaping who we are - our habits , interests , and worldviews . 
Consider the vast difference between the way young people and older generations interpret privacy in the Internet age . 
It is also extending our lifespans , with one in two babies born today in Switzerland expected to live more than 100 years . 
On balance , the impact of technological progress will be positive . 
For example , job automation will ultimately propel more people toward higher-paying , more productive employment that is better suited to the new era of &quot; talentism , &quot; when human imagination and innovation , not capital or natural resources , drive economic growth . 
Government , more than any other sector , can shape the impact of technological change , ensuring that challenges are addressed and opportunities are seized . 
Indeed , it should be at the forefront of such change , by creating an environment that encourages private-sector innovation and creativity , while ensuring that citizens are equipped to compete . 
Of course , governments cannot always be ahead of the curve . 
They will also have to react and respond to new needs and demands , such as the expectation that public services meet the same level of high-tech efficiency and convenience that private companies offer . 
Change may be frightening , but it is inevitable . 
The latest wave of technological change is far from cresting . 
We should be excited - and filled with hope - by where it could take us .
