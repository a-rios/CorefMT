In Search of Vampires 
In Eastern European folk tales , vampires are nocturnal bloodsuckers who have risen from the dead . 
We know these creatures &apos; apotheosis , Dracula , as a vampire from Transylvania , a bat-like person with long canine teeth who lies in a coffin during the day and bites necks and drinks blood for sustenance . 
But why do we know about Dracula and vampires at all ? 
Why and how did a regional myth grow into one of modern Western culture &apos;s most enduring fixtures ? 
The historical Dracula , Vlad Tepes , was no vampire . 
Vlad was born in 1431 and reigned on and off from 1448 as Prince Woiwode of Walachei , the southern part of today &apos;s Romania , clashing regularly with the Ottoman Empire , Hungary &apos;s King Matthias Corvinus , and the Saxon cities of Transylvania . 
Although he achieved important victories over the Ottomans , Corvinus took him prisoner , and he was killed in 1477 in renewed fighting with Ottoman troops . 
Vlad received the nickname &quot; Draculea &quot; - derived from &quot; Dragon &quot; - from his father . 
Written another way , &quot; Dragolea , &quot; the name means &quot; of love &quot; or &quot; the lovely one &quot; - hardly fitting for a man who developed the unlovely habit of lancing his foes on a stake , from which the nickname &quot; Tepes &quot; ( the Impaler ) was derived . 
Reports of Vlad &apos;s cruel method - by no means unusual at the time - were already in circulation during his lifetime , and Corvinus probably gave his brutality a particularly bloodthirsty spin . 
The propaganda campaign against Vlad succeeded brilliantly , satisfying the public &apos;s appetite for sensation with graphic images of the vicious , impaling prince . 
These images of Vlad have been revived , particularly in the West , to demonize East Europeans . 
Since the sixteenth century , Czar Ivan IV - Ivan the Terrible - was called the &quot; Russian Dracula . &quot; 
Similarly , the seventeenth-century Hungarian Transylvanian Countess Elizabeth Báthory , who tortured young girls to death and believed in the curative power of bathing in their blood , contributed to the West &apos;s image of Eastern Europe as the heart of darkness of the human soul . 
Vampire panic seized the European public repeatedly in the eighteenth century . 
In 1732 , news swept through the Continent that a dead man from a Serbian village killed others at night . 
His exhumed body had not decayed . 
A stake was driven through his heart and his body was burned . 
Soon other bodies were exhumed in various places in Europe and found to be in a similar preserved condition , giving rise to a literature that rigorously examined , among other questions , the connection between vampires and bats , butterflies , and ravens . 
But the parallel development of science underpinned efforts to expose such &quot; superstition . &quot; 
In 1755 , the enlightened absolutist monarchy in Vienna acted . 
Empress Maria Theresa prohibited belief in vampires and ordered a thorough examination of possible natural reasons for such unusual events , as well as the actual causes of death . 
Vampires , according to eighteenth-century science , were nothing more than the product of victims &apos; delirium . 
The spirit of science found a tactical ally in the Catholic Church , which held that belief in vampires defiles the resurrection of Jesus . 
This position also opened another front in the Church &apos;s battle with Eastern European Orthodox Christianity , which lent theological support to vampire myths by teaching that non-decomposed bodies could not go to heaven and could be revivified by the devil . 
On both the scientific and the Catholic view , whoever believed in vampires was regarded as superstitious and condemned as uneducated . 
Thus , at a time when Eastern Europe began to solidify itself in the perception of the West , it did so as a bastion of heresy that had to be &quot; civilized . &quot; 
But , having debunked the vampire myth , Western intellectuals proceeded to refashion it . 
Voltaire transferred the image of bloodsucking vampires to speculators , merchants , kings , and monks . 
From here , the line could be drawn to capitalists , Jews , women - the vamp - and politicians . 
At the same time , people &apos;s irrational fears and secret desires could not be suppressed . 
In the West , occultism emerged in response to the Enlightenment &apos;s faith in science , helped by a number of medical professionals who claimed that vampires actually existed . 
Literary works in which people who committed cruel , bloody acts were transformed into vampires became popular from 1820 onwards . 
Vlad Tepes was transformed into a vampire by the most famous of these stories : Bram Stoker &apos;s novel Dracula in 1897 . 
Stoker researched vampire myths intensively , and was influenced by historical books , travel descriptions , and the Hungarian orientalist Ármin Vámbéry . 
He linked the various strands of popular myth with historically frightful characters to cement the association of Eastern Europe with obscurantism and darkness in the popular imagination of the West . 
Viewed against this foil , the West - with Stoker &apos;s Britain at its pinnacle - emerged as the seat of universal reason . 
Belief in vampires in Eastern European societies served its own historical purposes : uniting communities and identifying outsiders , giving concrete form to death fears , explaining mysterious events , and , last but not least , providing a means of resistance to the encroachment of Western ideas and patterns of thought . 
If the thought of Dracula and vampires makes us shiver , then the vampire myth still fulfills its functions for us : as a projection of our fears and uncertainties , sexual desires , group and personal animosities , and longing for the dissolution of the structure of society . 
Ultimately , the spiritual gloom and existential dread that we have come to associate with Eastern Europe are merely an extension of our own .
