The Road to Car Safety 
TOKYO - The automobile - long a symbol of freedom , status , and success - is at a crossroads . 
For more than a century , cars have enabled billions of people to travel farther , faster , and more efficiently than ever before . 
They have helped power the world &apos;s great economies and shaped our modern social and cultural landscape . 
But all of this has come at a price : accidents , congestion , pollution , and an uneasy dependence on oil , among other costs . 
Our challenge , therefore , is to boost the benefits and reduce ( and eventually eliminate ) the harm done by our cars , so that the future of motor travel is clean , efficient , safe , and accessible to all . 
For our industry to remain an instrument of progress , we must therefore work closely with our peers from other industries and government in three major areas : safety , the environment , and affordability . 
Road safety is a grave concern . 
More than 3,000 people die in auto-related accidents every day . 
Lower-income countries account for only half of all vehicles on the road but suffer more than 90 % of the fatalities . 
India has four times fewer cars than France , though it suffers 20 times more road-related deaths - that is , 80 times more accidents per car . 
But safety is improving . 
In Europe , even as the number of vehicles has doubled , the number of road deaths has been halved . 
One reason for this is the introduction of technologies such as anti-lock brakes , airbags , and electronic stability control . 
Technologies now in development could even eliminate auto-related fatalities altogether . 
One such innovation is autonomous driving . 
Renault and Nissan are currently working on complementary technologies that can predict , detect , and prevent collisions . 
By reducing the stresses of driving in heavy traffic and unfamiliar locations , this technology promises greater protection for both drivers and pedestrians . 
It is especially valuable to people with restricted mobility , such as elderly or disabled drivers . 
But such breakthrough technologies are not simply invented and then implemented - they need government support in the form of a coherent set of laws and regulations covering their use . 
Policymakers must therefore be involved at an early development stage if we are to reach the goal of &quot; zero fatality &quot; roads within our lifetimes . 
The auto industry can also make a vital contribution to the environment . 
Fifteen years ago , the Renault-Nissan Alliance evaluated the environmental impact of its vehicles over their life cycle . 
The study examined the effect of our raw-material usage ; the impact of car exhaust on public health , especially in congested urban areas ; and the contribution to overall greenhouse-gas emissions - 23 % of which come from the auto industry worldwide . 
As a result of that evaluation , the Alliance invested more than â‚¬ 4 billion ( $ 5.5 billion ) in zero-emission technologies . 
Today , ours is the only auto group that mass-produces a full line of zero-emission cars and light commercial vehicles . 
Renault and Nissan together have sold more than 100,000 such vehicles worldwide - more than all of the other major carmakers combined . 
The broader task is to integrate these vehicles into a more efficient and cleaner power grid - for example , by replacing aging coal-fired power plants with hydroelectric power . 
Moreover , local and national governments should work with the automobile industry to integrate zero-emission vehicles into national transport infrastructure . 
If this is achieved , we believe it will be possible for cars to have zero impact on the environment in the foreseeable future . 
Greater health and safety , however , should not ( and need not ) come at the expense of developing countries , whose citizens want the fruits of prosperity that developed countries &quot; citizens have long enjoyed . 
In 1999 , Brazil , Russia , India , and China accounted for a mere 8 % of vehicle sales worldwide ; by 2012 , their combined sales had reached a staggering 35 % of the global total . 
And this proportion is sure to rise . 
The Alliance &apos;s CMF-A platform , created and manufactured in India , will pave the way for many more affordable vehicles throughout the developing world . 
These advances are at the forefront of a growing trend toward &quot; frugal innovation &quot; that is increasingly being adopted in developed markets , too . 
It is hard to overestimate the impact that the automobile has had on our political , economic , social , and cultural life over the past century . 
The industry &apos;s global sales are greater than the GDP of all but the five largest economies , and it employs more than 50 million people worldwide . 
Its future is bound up with that of the world economy . 
The challenge now is to reinvent the car so that it remains a proud totem of freedom and safety in the decades ahead .
