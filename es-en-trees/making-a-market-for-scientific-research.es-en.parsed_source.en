Making a Market for Scientific Research 
Scientific advances are the fundamental cause of economic progress , and yet many nations often apparently hope to piggyback on discoveries made in more scientifically-advanced countries . 
This is the most practical and efficient strategy in the early stages of development . 
But , to reach the advanced stages of economic growth , a country needs scientific research at home . 
Every government tries to encourage scientific research through education in science . 
But education by itself is of only limited use here . 
After all , science is a form of enterprise , requiring a sophisticated organization of resources and workers , an adventuresome attitude , and a willingness to take risks for possibly great rewards . 
Normally , the market fosters the advance of entrepreneurial endeavors . 
Were such a market for science to exist , scientists would form enterprises , just like businesses , the best of which would succeed , while others would fail . 
The problem is that basic scientific research is mostly a public good that cannot be withheld from those who use it and which seeps into the body of scientific know-how in unanticipated ways . 
But if there is no market that impersonally values and rewards scientific achievement , how are good scientific projects to be selected and rewarded without the great waste that often accompanies non-market , bureaucratic solutions to the problems of provision of public goods ? 
There is a danger that scientific establishments may degenerate into fiefdoms controlled by scientific mandarins who dominate major state-funded university departments and laboratories . 
Indeed , scientists in a number of countries , some with past scientific glories , may already recognize this malady in their own institutions today . 
The price their countries pay is a more sclerotic and slowly growing economy . 
No perfect substitutes for the market in the area of scientific discovery exist , but a good surrogate , which enables scientists to compete effectively , is the system of peer review , i.e. , the anonymous evaluation of research by scientific colleagues . 
Top scientists , sheltered by anonymity , can usually spot originality and can judge which scientific ideas have real value . 
Peer review grew out of the first two scientific journals , the Journal des SÃ§avans in France and the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in England , both founded in 1665 . 
These journals cast a wide net for the best research and relied on leading experts to evaluate ideas . 
But their support of scientific research was limited to publication . 
In the 1940 &apos;s , Vannevar Bush , a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and science advisor to President Roosevelt , advocated the creation of a government agency that would dramatically expand the impact of peer review by using it to allocate significant financial support to research enterprises . 
In his 1945 book Science , the Endless Frontier , Bush argued that basic scientific research needs substantial and stable financial support ; that support should be potentially available to all researchers ; and that peer review should ultimately decide how and to whom funds are allocated . 
Those who dispense money , he argued , should look only at new research ideas , not at the organizational charts of research institutions . 
His book led to the creation , in 1950 , of the US National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , a major factor underlying America scientific success . 
The use of anonymous peer review to assess proposals and allocate financial support for scientific research is increasingly achieving recognition around the world . 
Most major countries now have some kind of agency that issues general calls for proposals and uses peer review to evaluate them . 
Problems remain , however , in making newly established peer-review systems work well . 
Smaller countries face difficulties in ensuring anonymity : the number of qualified scientists within a specific field may be so small that researchers can easily guess who reviews which proposals , and powerful figures can retaliate for negative evaluations of their unpromising research ideas . 
This is an important reason why the proposed European Research Council is a good idea . 
Modeled after the NSF , it would augment the science foundations of individual European countries , creating a much larger research organization - one that draws from a larger pool of proposals . 
The size of the market for peer review is not the only issue . 
Countries with politicized universities , or universities where bosses with powerful connections outside academia run the research enterprise , find it difficult to fund the best scientists . 
The same is true in systems where there is a strong sense of bureaucratic entitlement . 
Japan is an example of a country where the science establishment has been insufficiently reformed . 
Government bureaucrats used to target industrial research in the old days , but these efforts have been largely abandoned since the stock market collapse . 
The government then increased funding for basic research and created &quot; centers of excellence &quot; at universities , but it failed to dismantle the koza system , in which powerful senior professors often dominate research departments . 
Greater progress is being made in Germany , where , despite popular opposition to an elitist university system such as in the US , Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called last year for German universities to become much more competitive with each other . 
Similar changes can be expected in other countries , as the importance of scientific competition and entrepreneurship becomes better understood . 
Policies that allow scientists to compete for resources nurture creative competition and allow people to construct appropriate incentives and risk-management structures . 
They are part of a worldwide trend whereby natural and culturally specific obstacles to a competitive and financially sophisticated marketplace for scientific research are gradually removed . 
There can be no free market for basic science in the literal sense of the term . 
But the benefits of markets can and should be pursued by other means .
