How Japan Fuels Global Financial Instability 
Over the past several years , much attention has focused on the role of China &apos;s trade surplus in creating today &apos;s global financial imbalances . 
But too little attention has been paid to the role of Japan &apos;s policy of near-zero interest rates in contributing to these imbalances . 
As global financial uncertainty rises , it is time for Japan to change course . 
Japan &apos;s ultra-low interest rate policy was initiated in the 1990 &quot; s to put a floor under the economy following the bursting of its asset price bubble . 
However , over time these ultra-low interest rates have promoted a highly speculative financial &quot; carry &quot; trade : speculators borrow yen at low interest rates and then buy dollars and other currencies that are invested in higher-yield assets elsewhere . 
There are two key features of this carry trade . 
First , it contributes to yen depreciation and dollar appreciation as carry traders switch out of yen . 
Second , it increases global asset demand , generating asset price inflation . 
The yen &apos;s depreciation versus the dollar has contributed to continuing large US trade deficits with Japan . 
It has also pressured other East Asian countries to under-value their exchange rates in order to remain competitive with Japan . 
Given China &apos;s under-valued currency , East Asia &apos;s two largest economies have thus anchored down exchange rates throughout the region , thereby increasing the region &apos;s trade surplus at the expense of jobs and growth in the rest of the global economy . 
Funds switched out of Japan have shifted to other financial markets , with the chase for yield driving up asset prices and lowering interest rates . 
In the US , this has complicated the Federal Reserve &apos;s task . 
The Fed has been trying to slow demand growth and cool the housing price bubble to avoid inflation , but carry trade speculators have been easing credit . 
Most importantly , the carry trade generates global financial fragility by creating fundamental - and dangerous -mismatches . 
First , carry traders borrow in yen but invest in dollars and other currencies . 
Second , carry traders borrow short-term money in Japan but may invest in longer-term assets outside Japan . 
Unexpected yen appreciation could cause large carry trade exchange rate losses , as could unexpected closing of the interest rate gap with Japan . 
Such losses , or just the thought of them , have the potential to trigger global contagion as carry traders close positions in US markets to repay loans in Japan . 
In addition to the global dangers of the carry trade , the policy of ultra-low interest rates may also be bad for Japan . 
This is because ultra-low interest rates may hurt Japan &apos;s households and lower consumption , and this effect may be larger than the benefit that a weak yen confers on Japan &apos;s exports . 
Higher interest rates can spur consumption if their impact on income outweighs the increased incentive to save . 
This may well be the case for Japan , which has a rapidly aging population . 
Current ultra-low interest rates may be scaring people about the adequacy of future income . 
Raising rates could alleviate those fears , increasing consumer confidence and spending . 
Additionally , raising interest rates would be a form of expansionary fiscal policy . 
This is because Japan has a large public debt , and increasing interest payments on that debt would put extra money in the hands of households . 
The policy of ultra-low interest rates was justified in the aftermath of the bursting of Japan &apos;s asset price bubble , but Japan stabilized its economy long ago . 
At this stage , the policy has become a contributor to global financial fragility , and it may be retarding Japan &apos;s own prosperity by contributing to consumer anxieties . 
That means Japan should decisively abandon ultra-low interest rates , albeit gradually so as to allow an orderly unwinding of speculative positions .
