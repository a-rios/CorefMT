Europe &apos;s Divisions , Old and New 
LJUBLJANA : From Joschka Fisher to Jacques Chirac visions of a federal EU are multiplying . 
To Slovenes , these ideas are unsettling reminders of Yugoslavia &apos;s federal design . 
Yugoslavia &apos;s federation failed because , in uniting so many differences , it could be held together only by undemocratic , even authoritarian , means . 
Should Slovenes , who avoided the worst of Yugoslavia &apos;s bloody dissolution , now jump into a new federal adventure , even if it is a European one ? 
That choice , of course , is not Slovenia &apos;s alone and is , anyway , now hostage to other concerns . 
Ten years ago , after the Berlin wall fell and Germany was reunited , Europe &apos;s democracies said that they wanted to repair the historic injustice of Europe &apos;s division , when the countries of East / Central Europe became a type of war booty for the Soviet Union . 
Today , as almost anyone east of the old Iron Curtain will tell you , however , enlargement is moving ahead at a snail &apos;s pace . 
Candidate countries must harmonize their political and economic systems with the so-called acquis communautaire ; current EU members want to ensure their ability to absorb enlargement by revising the EU &apos;s structures . 
It is often heard that the current number of members already makes the EU &apos;s work difficult . 
So it is virtually impossible to imagine enlargement to 27 members not endangering today &apos;s system . 
The EU &apos;s first response to these fears was to make minimal changes - ie , to the number of commissioners , the weight of votes within the Council of Ministers , and qualified majority voting . 
Soon after the Amsterdam summit of 1997 , however , &quot; minimalism &quot; became insufficient . 
Big member states began to use the prospect of enlargement as a tool to reduce the influence of smaller states ; smaller states now struggle convulsively to avoid being marginalized . 
Fears of equal intensity confront candidate countries . 
Despite occasional invitations to consult , they are de-facto excluded from participating in decisions about the EU &apos;s future structure , federalist or not . 
Moreover , they worry that the problems associated with changing EU decision-making will delay enlargement , with current EU members conveniently able to blame the candidates for this inaction . 
These fears multiplied when the Helsinki Summit of 1999 raised the number of candidate countries from 6 to 12 . 
Of course , offering membership to more countries is praiseworthy , but doing so may postpone membership for the first candidates . 
That worry was confirmed earlier this year when the European Commission curtailed negotiations with the first group of candidates , ostensibly to allow the others to catch-up . 
Exacerbating all this is the specter of federalism which haunts governments from London to Copenhagen . 
In a bid to reconcile euro-skeptics and euro-enthusiasts , the idea of a two speed Europe - which began with the Schengen border arrangements and continued with the euro - gained momentum . 
Today , it seems , the right to opt out or opt into an EU policy may be becoming a general rule . 
But there are dangers in this . 
The differences created among members may devastate the spirit of commonality . 
In the eyes of candidate countries , moreover , the two-tier EU that may emerge poses the added threat of first and second class membership , with today &apos;s members trying to escape the consequences of expansion by leaping ahead into some higher , more exclusive , form of membership . 
Tolerance of such fundamental differences seems certain to effect Europe &apos;s emerging foreign and defense policies . 
The search for a common European stance in international affairs reflects Europe &apos;s experience in Yugoslavia &apos;s wars . 
A decade &apos;s bloodshed exposed the EU as incapable of solving a crisis in its backyard without American help . 
It will take years , of course , before Europe is independent of the US in the military sense , an independence some members , and most candidates , do not seek . 
Any misstep here could jeopardize what Europe has built over the decades . 
Having now assumed the EU &apos;s presidency , France will seek a consensus for changes in EU decision-making . 
Some expect a precise time-table for enlargement with the first candidates to also be set , but I doubt this will happen . 
Next December &apos;s summit in Nice will be a success if it merely sets relatively short deadlines for accepting new members . 
If the mood about enlargement does not improve , however , expect the Nice summit to offer only vague formulations . 
That vagueness will be deliberate , because anyone speaking too bluntly on matters like this nowadays can expect to be quarantined like JÃ¶rg Haider . 
Development of the EU over the next few years may well depend on how France leads the EU . 
By reinvigorating its axis with Germany , France seems intent on pushing forward proposals to strengthen the powers of big EU states . 
The resulting inequality will probably be hard to reconcile with a viable federalism and will likely breed resentment among small EU members and candidate countries , putting expansion at greater risk . 
A decade after Europe &apos;s old division ended , the scars remain raw . 
So creating new divisions between big and small , have and have nots , and then trying to subsume them in a one-size-fits-all federalism may only revive all that Europe sought to avoid through its democratic integration . 
Failure to adequately address the historical injustice of Europe &apos;s postwar division , indeed , may lead only to renewed instability and crisis . 
Yugoslavia &apos;s wars of the past decade provide ample warnings as to what may happen when a federal system is torn apart by resentment .
