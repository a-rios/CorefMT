Europe in a Multipolar World 
BERLIN - One aspect of the Ukraine crisis that both Russia and the West need to understand is that the rest of the world appears to be relatively unconcerned about it . 
Though the West , along with Japan , may view the crisis as a challenge to the global order , most other states do not feel threatened by Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea or designs it may have elsewhere in Ukraine . 
Instead , many view this crisis as being largely about Europe &apos;s inability to resolve its own regional disputes - though a successful outcome could bolster Europe &apos;s global influence as a peacemaker . 
As the Ukraine crisis unfolded , Russian policymakers and commentators talked about &quot; the end of the Post-Cold War era , &quot; while Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dimitri Rogozin even appeared to welcome the start of a New Cold War . 
Such wishful thinking is predicated on the notion that conflict between Russia and the West would once again come to define the entire international system , thereby returning Russia to its former superpower status . 
That is not going to happen . 
As emerging powers &quot; reactions to the Ukraine crisis demonstrate , world politics is no longer defined by what happens in Europe , even when a major conflict is brewing there . 
The international system has become so multi-polar that non-European states can now choose to follow their own interests rather than feel obliged to side with the East or the West . 
Few world leaders doubt that Russia &apos;s use of force to compromise Ukraine &apos;s territorial integrity , change its borders , and annex Crimea violated international law . 
China &apos;s abstention in the subsequent United Nations Security Council vote clearly signaled its leaders &quot; displeasure with Kremlin policy . 
But nearly one-third of the UN &apos;s members sent an equally emphatic message by abstaining or not participating in a General Assembly vote condemning Russia &apos;s actions . 
Even Western-friendly governments - including Brazil , India , South Africa , and Israel - were not prepared to take sides . 
The Indian journalist Indrani Bagchi referred to the abstentions as a new form of non-alignment . 
Cynicism and schadenfreude may also be playing a role . 
Raja Mohan , a prominent Indian strategist , notes that Europe &quot; has never ceased to lecture Asia on the virtues of regionalism , &quot; but now seems unable to cope with its own regional security challenges . 
The implicit message from the new non-aligned is straightforward : Why should we care about a territorial conflict in Europe when you Europeans fail to act decisively on Palestine , Kashmir , or territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas ? 
Instead , many of these countries are calling on the West to de-escalate the crisis and , as an official Chinese foreign-ministry statement advocated , to &quot; exercise restraint and refrain from raising tensions . &quot; 
That is good advice - and no different from what Europeans tell others in similar situations . 
Unlike other regions of the world , however , Europe , including Russia , can be proud of its regional security organizations , such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) ; 
Europe needs to make them work . 
The OSCE , for example , would be greatly strengthened if , using its wide range of diplomatic mechanisms ( such as roundtable discussions and support for constitutional reforms ) , it succeeded in defusing the Ukraine crisis and thereby bolstered European security . 
Doing so would also provide a powerful example of institutionalized regionalism that might serve as a conflict-resolution model for other countries . 
Alternatively , if Europe is unable to resolve the Ukraine crisis with diplomacy , its global influence , and that of Russia , will surely fade . 
Russia has reminded the world that it is possible to bully one &apos;s neighbors and steal their territory using brute force ; but , in a globalized , multi-polar system , this alone will not be enough to rally other countries to its cause . 
And the EU , as a highly sophisticated paper tiger , would be no more attractive . 
EU member states have no interest in letting their continent slip back into ethnic nationalism and power politics . 
The Ukraine crisis is therefore both a challenge and an opportunity . 
If Europe wants to remain a pole in a multi-polar international system , it must prove that it can pursue a common foreign and security policy , particularly in times of crisis and conflict . 
That means that the EU must emerge from the Ukraine crisis with a stronger commitment to common defense and joint contingency planning , and a unified energy policy that can secure independence from Russian oil and gas . 
But Europe must also show that it can , and will , defend the principles of rules-based international relations . 
Maintaining and strengthening the pillars of Europe &apos;s common defense is not a simple task ; but multilateral security organizations like the OSCE are not made for easy times . 
They are intended to protect members from manipulation and aggression , and in a way that can garner global support . 
In this sense , Europe &apos;s main task now is to leverage its already considerable strategic assets .
