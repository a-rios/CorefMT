India &apos;s Second Wind 
NEW DELHI - The Indian economy is coming back . 
After several years of disappointing performance , the authorities are shifting to policies aimed at boosting the annual growth rate closer to the roughly 9 % level that India achieved from 2004 to 2008 . 
That won &apos;t be easy . 
India has many handicaps and lacks many of the things that are needed to sustain rapid growth . 
Although India has outstanding universities and technological institutes , the primary-education system is disastrously poor . 
The caste system and labor laws prevent an efficient labor market . 
The policy of quotas for lower castes and for members of certain &quot; scheduled &quot; tribes affects educational institutions , government employment , and even private firms . 
Populist policies that transfer scarce budget funds to hundreds of millions of rural men and women end up encouraging them to withdraw their labor services , driving up wages and undermining international competitiveness . 
True , bureaucratic rules are not nearly as constraining as they were during the pre-1991 &quot; license raj . &quot; 
But business activity remains bogged down by myriad restrictions and a frustratingly slow judicial system , which , together with a complex system of price subsidies , encourage widespread corruption at every level of government . 
Moreover , India &apos;s infrastructure is inadequate for a modern economy . 
With too little electricity , blackouts are common . 
Ports are inefficient , roads are congested , and traffic is astonishingly chaotic . 
And , while India urgently needs to reform its tax system , spending policies , and regulation , political change is difficult in a multiparty federalist democracy of 1.2 billion people spread over a large subcontinent . 
The current government is a fragile multiparty coalition . 
The Congress party leads the government , but lacks a majority in both chambers of Parliament . 
Coalition infighting and the prospect of a national election in 2014 further complicate efforts to enact reform legislation . 
And yet , despite everything , India &apos;s economy did record roughly 9 % growth for several years , and even now is growing by nearly 6 % annually , behind only China and Indonesia among major economies . 
One key to India &apos;s economic success is a large population of technically educated entrepreneurs , who are creating new companies and building a modern middle class . 
A high rate of private saving and strong inflows of capital from abroad have supported investment in plant and equipment . 
The Indian states have substantial policy discretion and often compete to attract businesses and achieve rapid economic growth . 
The main ingredient needed to achieve faster sustained growth is increased investment . 
Reducing the budget deficit - by limiting government spending and combating a culture of tax avoidance - will increase total domestic savings available to invest . 
Convincing foreign direct investors that India is a reliable destination will increase the inflow of long-term funds . 
Fortunately , the recent threat of a downgrade of Inda &apos;s sovereign credit rating - which would have made it difficult to finance the current-account deficit - has led to a government reshuffle and a shift in policies . 
The key political change was the appointment of a new finance minister , Palaniappan Chidambaram , whose selection by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi sent a strong positive signal to the Indian business community and to financial markets . 
Chidambaram , a Harvard-trained lawyer who has held the finance portfolio twice before , is committed to increasing growth and to adopting pro-market policies . 
He knows what needs to be done - and is pushing his political colleagues to do it . 
One sign of progress is that a new cabinet committee , chaired by Singh , will review large private investment projects that have been held up by regulatory issues or other legal barriers . 
Breaking this logjam will be important , both in itself and for the message that it conveys to domestic and foreign investors . 
Likewise , India &apos;s recent decision to allow large foreign retailers like Wal-Mart to enter the market reflects an encouraging change of attitude that is important beyond the specifics of the particular firms that will now come to India . 
And legislation will soon create the opportunity for expanded foreign ownership in the financial sector . 
On the fiscal front , the shift from a complex system of state-level indirect taxes to a national goods and services tax ( a type of value-added tax ) will improve efficiency and raise revenue . 
Lowering the subsidy for diesel fuel was politically difficult , but will reduce both the fiscal deficit and excessive use of diesel products . 
Government investment in infrastructure , both alone and in partnership with private firms , will also directly benefit growth and attract larger inflows of foreign investment . 
Finally , a remarkable plan to enroll every Indian adult in a program using fingerprint identification as a substitute for bank debit cards will allow more efficient distribution of funds to poor villagers and the urban poor . 
More than three hundred million Indians have already been enrolled . 
All of this is an enormous undertaking - one that confronts innumerable potential impediments , both economic and political . 
But I am betting that India is rising again : millions more will be lifted out of poverty in the coming years , while the increasingly prosperous Indian middle class will expand further .
