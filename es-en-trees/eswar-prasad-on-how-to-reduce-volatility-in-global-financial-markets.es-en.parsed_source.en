The Capital-Flow Conundrum 
ITHACA - In recent months , emerging economies have experienced capital-flow whiplash . 
Indications that the US Federal Reserve might &quot; taper &quot; its quantitative easing ( QE ) drove investors to reduce their exposure to emerging markets , sharply weakening their currencies and causing their equity prices to tumble . 
Now that the taper has been postponed , capital is flowing back in some cases . 
But , with little influence , much less control , over what comes next , emerging economies are still struggling to figure out how to protect themselves from the impact of a Fed policy reversal . 
When the Fed initially hinted at its intention to taper QE , policymakers in some emerging economies cried foul , but were dismissed by advanced-economy officials as chronic complainers . 
After all , they initially rejected the very policies that they are now fighting to preserve . 
But emerging-market policymakers &quot; criticisms do not reflect an inconsistent stance ; in both cases , the crux of their complaint has been volatility . 
They have already attempted to erect defenses against the potentially destabilizing effects of advanced-country monetary policy by accumulating foreign-exchange reserves and establishing capital controls . 
Now they are calling on their central banks to ensure stability by , for example , raising short-term lending rates . 
But this approach fails to address the underlying issue - and misdiagnosing the problem could have far-reaching consequences , not only leading to ineffective solutions , but also possibly causing severe distortions for specific economies and the global financial system as a whole . 
In order to design effective remedies , it is useful to distinguish among three types of failures that impede financial-market functioning . 
First , there are market failures , which occur when , for example , investors display herd behavior , information asymmetries exist , or the structure of incentives for investment managers encourages excessive risk-taking . 
Second , there are policy failures , which occur when undisciplined macroeconomic policies and inconsistent or ineffective financial regulatory policies heighten the risks associated with volatile capital flows . 
The third - and currently most problematic - failure is one of national or international institutions . 
Domestic monetary policy has become the first and last line of defense against growth slowdowns and financial panics , enabling policymakers to avoid pursuing other important , but far more difficult measures . 
Using monetary policy to compensate for deficiencies in other policy areas constitutes an institutional breakdown : monetary policymakers are not necessarily getting it wrong , but they are constrained by the configuration of other policies . 
The inadequacy of the current framework for global governance compounds the problem . 
The grim reality is that , with financial markets becoming increasingly interconnected , monetary-policy measures taken by any of the major economies have international spillover effects . 
An effective governance mechanism or reliable institution is needed to help emerging markets cope with these effects . 
The lack of effective global economic governance has important implications for capital flows . 
Emerging-market policymakers believe that they lack recourse to safety nets that would cushion the impact of volatile flows . 
Their efforts to &quot; self-insure , &quot; by , say , building up their foreign-exchange reserves , perpetuate global economic imbalances . 
So how can policymakers address these failures ? 
There has been some progress at the international level on regulatory reforms aimed at addressing market failures , though such efforts have been limited by strident resistance from financial institutions . 
Solutions for policy failures are not difficult to discern . 
Flexible currencies , more transparent monetary frameworks , and sound long-term fiscal policies can serve as buffers against capital-flow volatility . 
Moreover , the functioning of emerging-economy financial markets should be improved , with policies aimed at institutional development and improved regulatory capacity . 
While the right policies cannot eliminate risk , they can ameliorate the cost-benefit tradeoff from capital flows . 
Fixing institutional failures is the most important - and the most difficult - step . 
Successful reform requires , first and foremost , finding the right mix of domestic policies . 
In the advanced economies , in particular , a sharper focus on long-term debt reduction , rather than short-term fiscal austerity , is needed , along with structural reforms to labor , product , or financial markets , depending on the country . 
In many of the troubled emerging economies , however , monetary policy has shouldered the burden of controlling inflation , managing the local currency &apos;s value , and supporting growth . 
This balancing act is difficult to maintain , leaving these economies vulnerable when the external environment turns unfavorable . 
In India , for example , increasing productivity and long-term growth require fiscal discipline and a raft of financial- and labor-market reforms . 
But the central bank is being asked to do all the heavy lifting . 
In other emerging markets , too , the main challenge is to ensure that all macroeconomic and structural policies advance common goals . 
At the same time , the governance structure of multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund must be reformed , in order to bolster their legitimacy in emerging markets . 
Otherwise , these institutions will remain ineffective in confronting collective problems related to macroeconomic-policy spillovers , and in providing insurance against crises . 
Policymakers in advanced and emerging countries alike should focus on the underlying failures that destabilize their economies and impede growth , rather than trying to treat the symptoms by manipulating monetary policy or capital controls . 
Unless they are supported by strong institutional structures at all levels , such measures will prove futile in managing capital flows .
