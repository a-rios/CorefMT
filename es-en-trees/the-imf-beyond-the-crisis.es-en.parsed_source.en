The IMF Beyond The Crisis 
WASHINGTON , DC - When world leaders gather in Pittsburgh for the G-20 summit , they will take stock of the impact of the stimulus measures undertaken so far and discuss how to coordinate an orderly exit from those measures . 
They will need to strengthen international guidelines for capital requirements for large multinational banks and address the perverse financial incentives that led to irresponsible risk-taking in the financial sector . 
But the most lasting imprint they could leave is to give the International Monetary Fund a broader mandate after this crisis is over . 
The IMF &apos;s relevance has greatly increased during the crisis . 
It successfully contributed to a coordinated fiscal and monetary stimulus , which helped avert a cyclical meltdown . 
Its resources have tripled , enabling it to come to the rescue of countries as diverse as Iceland , Pakistan , and Ukraine , which were cut off from international capital markets . 
And the Fund has assisted low-income countries with large loans at unprecedented zero interest rates . 
The G-20 has shown leadership in providing the political and financial backing for these changes , and the IMF has responded swiftly . 
There is , however , a genuine risk that the political momentum will dissipate as the world economy slowly recovers . 
It would be a big mistake to let that happen . 
This crisis has shown that economic interdependence has grown to such an extent that policy coordination is unavoidable . 
The IMF should be given a clear mandate that would give it the political clout to help prevent such crises from recurring . 
The G-20 leaders should authorize the IMF to safeguard international financial stability . 
All crises of the past two decades had their origin not so much in misguided fiscal and monetary policies , nor in misaligned exchange rates , but rather in the explosive dynamics of financial markets . 
A strengthened role in ensuring financial stability would be a logical complement to the existing , but too narrow mandate the IMF has for overseeing the international monetary system . 
The two are clearly interlinked . 
A stronger financial stability role does not imply that the IMF would itself become a supervisor . 
Rather the Fund should build on work done by the Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) , the multilateral rule setting body established by the G-20 . 
This body is comprised of ministers of finance , central bankers , and supervisors from the G-20 countries . 
The IMF can help monitor whether countries follow up on agreed undertakings in the FSB , and alert leaders to gaps in the regulatory framework and vulnerabilities in the financial system that need to be addressed . 
But , for effective fulfillment of such a strengthened mandate , the IMF needs strong political backing that countries will follow up on its own advice as well . 
This has been lacking in the past , as the IMF had insufficient instruments to enforce policy action . 
Moreover , G-20 leaders should express their commitment to future policy coordination by , for example , organizing a peer-review process in which ministers would hold each other accountable for their economic and financial-sector policies . 
The IMF would contribute to this process with analysis , focusing on economic interdependencies and spillovers from one economy to another . 
Such surveillance can build on the findings of the early-warning exercise , which the IMF has initiated , together with the FSB . 
This exercise alerts ministers on low-risk but high-impact events and advises them on appropriate courses of action . 
The IMF can monitor the follow-up that countries give to policy advice following from these exercises . 
Global financial stability must be secured by a better functioning international monetary system . 
The IMF should analyze how to move in an orderly way from a dollar-based system to a multipolar system . 
The Special Drawing Right , the IMF-issued reserve currency based on a basket comprising the dollar , euro , yen , and pound sterling , may play a useful role here . 
( The yuan should be included as soon as China makes its currency convertible . ) 
A multipolar system may help better address global imbalances than the current dollar-based system , which simply perpetuates large imbalances as countries pile up large dollar reserves . 
The need for such build-up would lessen if the IMF develops into an insurance-type of institution that has SDR credit lines readily available . 
Today &apos;s political momentum should be used to carve out a strong role for the IMF beyond the crisis . 
International policy coordination , which has been effective in averting a financial meltdown , should continue after the crisis , preferably in the form of a peer-review process in the G-20 underpinned by IMF analysis . 
But continued political support for the IMF needs to be based on fairness in the institution itself . 
Quotas and influence in the international financial institutions should be based on countries &quot; economic weight and the ability to contribute financially . 
Therefore , the upcoming quota review will have to give a greater weight to countries that are currently underrepresented , particular the world &apos;s dynamic emerging economies .
