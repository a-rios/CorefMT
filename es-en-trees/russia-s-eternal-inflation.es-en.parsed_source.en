Russia &apos;s Eternal Inflation 
In eternal Russia , nothing changes when it comes to monetary management . 
Year after year , the Russian Central Bank ( RCB ) blames the weather , the poor harvest , or other non-monetary factors for its feeble performance in lowering the inflation rate . 
Unlike many emerging-market and transition economies in the 1990 &quot; s , Russia did not abandon a fixed-exchange rate anchor in favor of an inflation-targeting regime as its guide to monetary-policy . 
As a result , the period since the financial crisis of 1998 has generated serious problems for monetary and exchange-rate policies . 
Faced with a balance-of-payments surplus - largely thanks to high oil prices - the RCB &apos;s 2005 Monetary Program fudges : reducing inflation is a priority , but so is exchange-rate targeting in order to support growth . 
This &quot; just-do-it &quot; approach works fine in the United States , for example , where the Federal Reserve has established its anti-inflationary credibility . 
During the early transition years , the lack of an effective monetary-policy framework reflected the challenge of establishing new institutions and regulations , as well as the difficulty of overcoming the legacy of central planning , under which budget and credit financing were indistinguishable . 
Sometimes the RCB acted as the government &apos;s banker , providing liquidity without considering the financial markets ; at other times , it focused on the financial markets , providing liquidity to banks . 
In both cases , there is no link between inflation and interest rates . 
To be sure , the muted impact of inflation on interest rates is not surprising in transition economies , where the mechanisms of monetary-policy transmission and financial intermediation took long periods to put in place and still need reform and regulation . 
It is inevitably a long road from a starting point where credits are channeled to state-owned enterprises through state-owned banks to an economic environment in which interest rates are a proper indicator of monetary policy . 
Moreover , Russia &apos;s default and devaluation in 1998 undermined the progress that was accomplished - starting in 1996 - in the banking sector and the capital markets in general . 
But that excuse has worn thin . 
In recent years , slowing the pace of real exchange-rate appreciation to shelter domestic producers and employment from import competition seems to have gained clear precedence over disinflation . 
At the beginning of June , the RCB &apos;s governor , Sergei Ignatyev , admitted not only that this year &apos;s inflation target would be missed , but also that the RCB is not prepared to pursue inflation targets at the expense of a competitive exchange rate . 
This helps explain why the inflation rate , as measured by growth in the annual consumer price index , has remained stubbornly high . 
Indeed , for the first time since 1998 , the annual inflation rate has been rising this year , rendering the official targets - 7.5 % -8.5 % in 2005 , 6 % -7.5 % in 2006 and 5 % -6.5 % in 2007 - little more than lip service . 
Of course , many central banks around the world pursue both price stability and growth . 
As the IMF &apos;s latest annual report on Russia &apos;s economy points out , if the RCB continues to restrain the ruble &apos;s appreciation for the sake of growth , the result will merely be higher inflation , which implies that the ruble would still strengthen in real terms , thereby damaging growth . 
Russian macroeconomic performance has greatly improved since the 1998 financial crisis , and this success can be attributed in part to improved monetary policy . 
As a starting point , the RCB should be charged with projecting inflation , formulate policies to stabilize prices , and either implement those polices or explain why it cannot and who could do so . 
The correct answer to the latter question - as the IMF suggests - may be the Ministry of Finance : the only sure way for Russia to reduce inflation and sustain growth is to maintain a sound fiscal policy . 
The reality is the opposite . 
Rather than using the oil windfall to pay for long-overdue reforms in health care , education , and utilities - and thus helping to ensure the macroeconomic stability needed to sustain rapid long-term growth - President Vladimir Putin has chosen large spending increases for public wages and pensions . 
As a result , Putin &apos;s Russia appears headed for the Latin American model of self-inflicted stagflation .
