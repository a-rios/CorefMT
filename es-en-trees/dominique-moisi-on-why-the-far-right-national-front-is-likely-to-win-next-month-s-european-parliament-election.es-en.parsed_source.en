France &apos;s Dissonance Quartet 
PARIS - Mozart &apos;s &quot; Dissonance Quartet &quot; is arguably one of the most beautiful pieces of chamber music ever written . 
The title , linked to its highly unusual first movement , describes perfectly the far less beautiful state of French politics today . 
A quartet of figures currently dominate France &apos;s political stage : two on the left , François Hollande and Manuel Valls ; and two on the right , Nicolas Sarkozy and Alain Juppé . 
It is an understatement to say that contrary to the prerequisites of chamber music , they do not play together , but more or less openly against one another . 
On the left , catastrophic results for the ruling Socialists in municipal elections in March revealed the depth to which Hollande &apos;s popularity has sunk . 
With the Socialists facing a similar drubbing in the upcoming European Parliament election , Hollande had no choice but to install his highly popular interior minister , Manuel Valls in the Hôtel Matignon ( the prime minister &apos;s office ) . 
For the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic , power seems to be dramatically shifting away from the Elysée Palace ( the seat of the presidency ) . 
The letter and spirit of France &apos;s constitution makes the prime minister the country &apos;s second in command - &quot; my collaborator , &quot; as Sarkozy said of François Fillon - whose key role is to protect the president . 
But now Hollande is completely dependent on his prime minister . 
The dissonance on the left , in power since 2012 , began as soon as Hollande assumed office . 
The far-left denounces his administration &apos;s &quot; social-liberalism , &quot; which is even more clearly pronounced with Valls leading the cabinet . 
Despite his many declarations to the contrary , Valls - sometimes described as the &quot; Sarkozy of the left &quot; because of his restless dynamism and , yes , opportunism - really does seem to be in charge . 
Hollande has placed himself in a terrible predicament . 
If Valls succeeds , the triumph will be his , not Hollande &apos;s , reinforcing his transparent ambition to become President himself in 2017 . 
If Valls fails , his defeat will further weaken Hollande &apos;s chances of winning a second term . 
Many on the left , facing only unattractive scenarios , feel increasingly betrayed and dispirited . 
On the right , Sarkozy , despite his defeat two years ago , still views himself as the only alternative . 
But he faces an uphill battle . 
Though he is a consummate politician who is clearly missed by many of his party &apos;s activists , the rest of France &apos;s voters have even more clearly rejected him , mostly over issues of personality , and see no reason to modify their stance . 
Power , like nature , abhors a vacuum . 
Overwhelmingly reelected as Mayor of Bordeaux , Juppé , a former prime minister under Jacques Chirac ( and once Sarkozy &apos;s foreign minister ) , has reemerged as the most popular political figure in France , with sympathizers on the left and in the center . 
Juppé , whose efforts nearly 20 years ago to impose badly needed reforms made him one of the country &apos;s most unpopular politicians , might be forgiven a bit of schadenfreude . 
His age ( he is 68 ) might prove to be a handicap in 2017 , but it could also be an advantage : he is the only reassuring statesman-like figure in a quartet whose other members are an uninspiring incumbent and two power-obsessed men in a hurry . 
But this quartet is not alone on the stage . 
A fifth player , Marine Le Pen , the leader of the far-right National Front , offers the audience a radically different score . 
Le Pen is only too happy to capitalize on the succession of petty scandals hitting both the left and the right ( attributable partly to the climate of near-civil war prevailing in both camps in recent years ) . 
The latest scandal , for example , cost Hollande a key adviser , who was forced to resign after left-wing media exposed a conflict of interest . 
At the heart of this dissonance in mainstream French politics is Europe . 
Some segments of the left - who said &quot; No &quot; in 2005 to the proposed European Union Constitutional Treaty - oppose Europe for a combination of social and economic reasons , often resorting to appeals to national sovereignty . 
The right is equally divided on the issue of Europe , even if it does not include many anti-capitalists in its ranks . 
Like the EU &apos;s leftist opponents , they denounce &quot; diktats &quot; from the European Commission in Brussels and the French government &apos;s acquiescence in them . 
Unfortunately , one consequence of these multiple layers of dissonance is becoming all too clear . 
The National Front , the only party to present a coherent , united , and purely negative position on Europe , is predicted by many public opinion polls to win next month &apos;s European Parliament election . 
If it does , France &apos;s political cacophony will become a problem for Europe as well .
