Empowering Africa &apos;s Women 
JOHANNESBURG - Africa is again high on the global agenda , and this time for all the right reasons . As the kickoff to the World Cup in South Africa approaches , people are seeing not just South Africa but our entire continent as equal partners in this extraordinary global celebration . 
So , as the world &apos;s eyes turn to Africa , we should take the opportunity to showcase the key role that Africa &apos;s women are increasingly playing in the continent &apos;s success . 
Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf &apos;s election as President of Liberia , the first women elected to run an African country , was symbolic of the progress of women across the continent . 
We are proud as well that women make up more than 50 % of MPs in Rwanda - the highest proportion in the world . 
South Africa and Lesotho are just two other African countries that sit near the top of the gender-equality league table . 
It is women as well who are helping to calm tensions and heal Africa &apos;s terrible wounds of conflict and violence . 
Women are in the lead in conflict resolution , in reconciliation , and in drafting the legal and constitutional framework to secure peace and prevent abuses . 
In the media , civil society , and in communities up and down the African continent , women are taking on major responsibilities . 
There is a huge amount more to do , but women are winning the fight to have their voices heard and help shape solutions and map priorities . 
The gender gap in schooling remains a concern . 
Africa still lags behind many parts of the world in educating its girls from primary school through to university . 
But many more girls are attending and completing school now than a decade ago . 
Education is the bedrock for progress and educated women will empower Africa , so the focus now must be on those countries that are failing to close the gap . 
Governments need to implement the right strategies and find the political will and resources to succeed . 
One of the major problems highlighted in the just-published Africa Progress Report , prepared by the African Progress Panel , is the gap between plans and change on the ground . 
Another area where we have seen little progress is in harnessing women &apos;s full talents and potential in the formal economy . 
Women &apos;s economic contribution is , of course , under-valued in many places around the world . 
Wherever they live , women face greater obstacles and frustrations than their male counterparts . 
But this is particularly true in Africa - a continent where the crucial role that women play in the economy cannot be missed by even the most casual visitor . 
Look in our fields . 
It is women who you will see planting and harvesting the crops . 
Look in our markets . 
It is women who you will see buying and selling the goods on offer . 
Women , too , are setting up the small businesses that are creating jobs and spreading prosperity . 
Women are truly the motors of Africa &apos;s economies . 
Yet at every turn , their contribution is downplayed and their ambitions are obstructed . Women find themselves cut off from training and support . 
And they can face discrimination from the authorities and suppliers . 
But it is in women &apos;s treatment , deliberately and accidentally , by the financial sector that the most damage is done . 
Women receive , for example , only 10 % of the credit given to small farmers and less than 1 % of total loans to agriculture . 
Yet they are responsible for growing 80 % of the food on our continent . 
Inheritance rules dictating that land - and its proceeds - can be passed down only through the men of the family have put women at a terrible disadvantage . 
Africa &apos;s potential not only to feed its own people but to export food around the world is increasingly and rightly acknowledged . 
But this ambition will be met only through policies that recognize the central role of women in agriculture and enable them to drive a green revolution on the continent . 
Women &apos;s lack of assets , together with out-dated social norms , is also a major barrier blocking their access to the capital they need to set up and expand small businesses . 
Women-run start-ups are most likely to become established enterprises . 
Yet they command less than 10 % of the capital available for investment in new enterprises . 
The discrimination continues , despite overwhelming evidence showing that women are more likely to invest business loans wisely and to meet repayment schedules . 
Even micro-credit schemes often seem to lend less to women than to men in the same circumstances . 
Nor are these problems limited to small businesses . 
The African Women &apos;s Economic Summit , which I attended recently in Nairobi , was electrified by the story of a woman who had set up her own construction firm in Cameroon . 
Her capital needs run into hundreds of thousands of dollars . 
Yet , when dealing with financial institutions , she faced the same obstacles and out-dated attitudes familiar to the smallest businesswomen across the continent . 
Financial institutions must remove such barriers to fair and easy access to capital and financial services . 
For Africa to reach the growth rates needed to meet the United Nation &apos;s Millennium Development Goals , women must be brought fully into the formal economy and the financial sector . 
This requires innovation in the financial services and products on offer , which in turn requires that women - locally , regionally , and internationally - are helping to formulate the solutions . 
If governments and key stakeholders can lift the barriers that prevent women from playing their full role in our economy and societies , the future is bright - not just for women but our entire continent .
