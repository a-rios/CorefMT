All for One Tax and One Tax for All ? 
CAMBRIDGE - When the next full-scale global financial crisis hits , let it not be said that the International Monetary Fund never took a stab at forestalling it . 
Recently , the IMF proposed a new global tax on financial institutions loosely in proportion to their size , as well as a tax on banks &quot; profits and bonuses . 
The Fund &apos;s proposal has been greeted with predictable disdain and derision by the financial industry . 
More interesting and significant are the mixed reviews from G-20 presidents and finance ministers . 
Governments at the epicenter of the recent financial crisis , especially the United States and the United Kingdom , are downright enthusiastic , particularly about the tax on size . 
After all , they want to do that anyway . 
Countries that did not experience recent bank meltdowns , such as Canada , Australia , China , Brazil , and India , are unenthusiastic . 
Why should they change systems that proved so resilient ? 
It is all too easy to criticize the specifics of the IMF plan . 
But the IMF &apos;s big-picture diagnosis of the problem gets a lot right . 
Financial systems are bloated by implicit taxpayer guarantees , which allow banks , particularly large ones , to borrow money at interest rates that do not fully reflect the risks they take in search of outsized profits . 
Since that risk is then passed on to taxpayers , imposing taxes on financial firms in proportion to their borrowing is a simple way to ensure fairness . 
&quot; What risks ? &quot; the financial firms demand to know . 
The average cost of the bailouts was &quot; only &quot; a few percentage points of GNP . 
And the crisis was a once-in-a-half-century event . 
The IMF rightly points out that these claims are nonsense . 
During the crisis , taxpayers were on the hook for almost a quarter of national income . 
Perhaps the next crisis will not turn out so &quot; well , &quot; and the losses borne by the public will be staggering . 
Even with the &quot; success &quot; of the bailouts , countries suffered massive output losses due to recessions and sustained subpar growth . 
But , while regulation must address the oversized bank balance sheets that were at the root of the crisis , the IMF is right not to focus excessively on fixing the &quot; too big to fail &quot; problem . 
A surprising number of pundits seem to think that if one could only break up the big banks , governments would be far more resilient to bailouts , and the whole &quot; moral hazard &quot; problem would be muted . 
That logic is dubious , given how many similar crises have hit widely differing systems over the centuries . 
A systemic crisis that simultaneously hits a large number of medium-sized banks would put just as much pressure on governments to bail out the system as would a crisis that hits a couple of large banks . 
There are altogether too many complex ideas floating around that look good on paper , but might well prove deeply flawed in a big-time crisis . 
Any robust solution must be reasonably simple to understand and implement . 
The IMF proposal seems to pass these tests . 
By contrast , some finance specialists favor forcing banks to rely much more on &quot; contingent &quot; debt that can be forcibly converted to ( possibly worthless ) stock in the event of a system-wide meltdown . 
But how this form of &quot; pre-packaged bankruptcy &quot; could be implemented in a world of widely different legal , political , and banking systems is unclear . 
Financial history is littered with untested safety-net devices that failed in a crisis . 
Better to rein in the growth of the system . 
The IMF is on much weaker ground , however , in thinking that its one-size-fits-all global tax system will somehow level the playing field internationally . 
It won &apos;t . 
Countries that now have solid financial regulatory systems in place are already effectively &quot; taxing &quot; their financial firms more than , say , the US and the UK , where financial regulation is more minimal . 
The US and the UK don &apos;t want to weaken their competitive advantage by taxing banks while some other countries do not . 
But it is their systems that are in the greatest and most urgent need of stronger checks and balances . 
Let &apos;s not go too far in defending the &quot; holdout &quot; countries that are resisting the IMF proposal . 
These countries need to recognize that if the US and the UK do implement even modest reforms , a lot of capital will flow elsewhere , potentially overwhelming regulatory systems that seemed to work well until now . 
And what about the second tax proposed by the IMF , on banks &quot; profits and bonuses ? 
Such a tax is politically appealing , but ultimately it makes little sense - except , perhaps , in a crisis year when bank subsidies are glaringly transparent . 
It would be better to improve financial-market regulation directly and let national tax systems handle banks &quot; income like that of any other industry . 
The IMF &apos;s first effort at prescribing a cure may be flawed , but its diagnosis of a financial sector bloated by moral hazard is manifestly correct . 
Let &apos;s hope that when the G-20 leaders meet later this year , they decide to take the problem seriously instead of tabling discussion for a decade or two until the next crisis is upon us .
