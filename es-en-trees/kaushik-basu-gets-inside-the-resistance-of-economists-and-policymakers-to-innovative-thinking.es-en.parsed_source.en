The Fear of &quot; L &quot; 
WASHINGTON , DC - For the last few years , economists have been running through the alphabet to describe the shape of the long-awaited recovery - starting with an optimistic V , proceeding to a more downbeat U , and ending up at a despairing W. But now a deeper anxiety is beginning to stalk the profession : the fear of what I call an &quot; L-shaped &quot; recovery . 
Viewed in the light of the past five dismal years , 2013 was not bad for the advanced economies . 
The eurozone technically emerged from recession , the unemployment rate in the United States was lower than in previous years , and Japan began to stir after a long slumber and the negative shock of the earthquake and tsunami in 2011 . 
But if we look beneath the surface , it becomes evident that we are still hovering on the edge of a precipice . 
In the third quarter of this year , GDP contracted , on a year-on-year basis , not just in well-known cases like Greece and Portugal , but also in Italy , Spain , the Netherlands , and the Czech Republic . 
Moreover , labor-market conditions deteriorated toward the end of the year . 
The number of unemployed in Germany grew for four consecutive months up to November . 
Among the industrialized countries , the US is the bright spot . 
Japan &apos;s revival , meanwhile , was caused by a much-needed liquidity injection . 
Given these developments , a few commentators have written recently about the possibility of a prolonged slowdown in industrialized countries . 
This is not a popular view , with others criticizing its advocates for stoking pessimism . 
The fear of an L-shaped recovery is legitimate . 
Modern technology has enabled workers in emerging economies to join a global labor market ; in the absence of major policy innovation , this is likely to cause a prolonged drag on rich countries . 
There is , instead , a crisis of the economics profession , one that mirrors the crisis of the advanced economies . 
Thanks to technological change and relentless globalization , the character of entire economies has changed dramatically over the last 50 years . 
Why this stasis ? 
One possibility is that the same factors that are making entrepreneurs over-cautious about new ventures are making policymakers prone to conservatism . 
An engaging paper by the World Bank economists Leora Klapper and Inessa Love shows that one major consequence of the financial crisis has been entrepreneurs &quot; reluctance to start new firms . 
They show that after a steady increase from 2004 to 2007 , firm creation dropped sharply . 
In the United Kingdom , for example , the number of newly registered limited-liability companies fell from 450,000 in 2007 to 372,000 in 2008 and 330,000 in 2009 . 
What is interesting is that while this decline is most marked in advanced economies , which are especially dependent on financial markets , it is visible in virtually all of the 95 countries that the authors studied . 
The reason is not hard to fathom : A recession is a time when we tend to become cautious and stick to familiar territory , steering clear of new projects . 
The same mindset has become apparent among economists and policymakers . 
In times of profound uncertainty , the tendency is to cling to the domain of the familiar and avoid innovative thinking . 
This is especially unfortunate nowadays , when the structure of the global economy is changing rapidly . 
A telltale sign of over-caution among economists and policymakers has been their propensity to convert the need for evidence to an aversion to analytical creativity . 
We should , of course , use the best available evidence in crafting policy . 
In these uncharted territories , one must rely on a combination of intuition and theory . 
To resist new policy on the grounds that it is not founded in hard evidence is to trap us in the status quo . 
To see the mistake in this criticism , imagine that , on the basis of theory and some assumptions , one recommends new policy X , even though there is no hard evidence regarding whether or not X works . 
Now use Y to refer to &quot; not doing X. &quot; 
If there is no evidence regarding whether X works , there clearly is no evidence concerning whether Y works . 
So , if the lack of evidence is considered a good reason not to do X , it is also a good reason not to do Y. But this is a contradiction , because it is impossible not to do either X or Y. 
The propensity to use this inconsistent argument reflects a proclivity for the status quo and a bias against policy innovation . 
It is the absence of such creative thinking that has led the economics profession into an impasse , forcing economists and policymakers to contend with the fear of &quot; L. &quot;
