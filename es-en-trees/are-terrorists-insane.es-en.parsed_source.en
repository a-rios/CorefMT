Are Terrorists Insane ? 
ORLANDO - One of the most common popular misunderstandings about the causes of terrorism is the notion that terrorists must be &quot; insane &quot; to behave as they do . 
That idea is as wrong as it is comforting . 
Conservatives in the United States , for example , frequently rail against the &quot; madness &quot; of Islamic terrorists , and regard attempts to understand terrorism as appeasement or liberalism gone wild . 
In the wake of September 11 , 2001 , in particular , many on the right mistook the attempt to understand or explain the terrorists &quot; actions as an effort to condone them . 
We have been here before , though . 
After World War II , the myth of the &quot; mad Nazi &quot; exerted a forceful grip upon the popular imagination ; surely , only insane individuals could perpetrate something like the Holocaust . 
Moreover , by the early 1960 &quot; s , the social psychologist Stanley Milgram had shown that ordinary Americans would go to extraordinary lengths in obeying malevolent authority . 
He famously induced people from a variety of social classes and occupations to administer what they thought were increasingly harsh electrical shocks to a helpless victim ( played by an actor ) sitting in an adjoining room , and his findings have since been replicated around the world . 
This was an unpalatable conclusion . 
Faced with the horror of what the Nazis had done , most people found it psychologically easier to think of what had happened as the behavior of mentally unhinged individuals , or the result of some sort of collective fugue . 
A similar resistance to noisome conclusions - and similarly understandable from a psychological viewpoint - informs today &apos;s thinking about terrorists . 
Our default reaction , often reinforced by Western philosophical traditions and simplistic political rhetoric , is that evil acts must be the product of fundamentally evil or insane individuals . 
As with the Nazis , the study of modern terrorism began from the starting position that a single disposition - known in the literature as the &quot; terrorist personality &quot; - characterizes most or all terrorists . 
In the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , West German authorities allowed psychologists and psychiatrists to interview terrorism suspects then being held in prison or awaiting trial , including members of the Red Army Faction . 
A brigade of experts descended on the jails , looking for evidence to justify their own pet theories of terrorist psychology . 
Terrorists were all self-serving narcissists , some found after the interviews were done . 
Others argued that terrorists were all victims of clinical paranoia or some other psychosis . 
Some even suggested , somewhat bizarrely , that terrorists tend to have lost a parent in their childhood years and are acting out the aggression that derives from their resulting frustration with life . 
All of these views shared the belief that there was something fundamentally dysfunctional about the &quot; terrorist personality , &quot; something warped and unusual that sets &quot; them &quot; apart from &quot; us . &quot; 
Never mind that different researchers found different features of this so-called personality salient , and came to fundamentally different conclusions about it . 
In the years since , social science has reinforced skepticism that all terrorists share such essential personality traits . 
There is also a growing recognition that the social circumstances to which terrorists are exposed play a significant role . 
Put simply , the causes of terror are largely situational , and the situations are themselves as varied as the acts themselves ( members of the IRA , for instance , have obviously been exposed to circumstances very different from members of Al Qaeda ) . 
It must be admitted , of course , that our access to real-life terrorists is limited , and we still have much to learn about the kind of environments that foster terroristic behavior . 
Arguably , our knowledge of the factors that led to the July 2005 bombings in London , for example , is still far less impressive than our ignorance . 
The great contribution of social science to the understanding of human evil has been to expose unpalatable truths . 
When we resort to psychologically comforting but misleading assumptions about terrorism , we hamper our own understanding of political violence in general - and hence weaken our ability to avert or minimize it .
