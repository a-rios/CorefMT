The Fear Factor 
LOS ANGELES - The debate over fiscal expansion versus consolidation continues to divide the developed world . 
In response to the global recession of 2008 , the United Kingdom embarked on an austerity program while the United States enacted an $ 800 billion fiscal stimulus . 
Despite a softening economy , British Prime Minister David Cameron is promising to stay the austerity course . 
Obama , too , is sticking to his guns with his recent proposal for an additional $ 450 billion of government expenditure and tax cuts to help boost employment . 
Unemployment in the US has remained above 9 % for 22 of the last 24 months . 
While some are supporting additional stimulus , others are calling for UK-style austerity . 
But would either of these approaches reduce unemployment most effectively , or would a new round of &quot; quantitative easing &quot; ( an unconventional form of economic stimulus by which the central bank purchases financial assets ) work better ? 
With Nobel prize-winning economists on both sides of the current debate about how to solve the unemployment problem , the public is rightly confused . 
Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz are calling for an even larger fiscal stimulus to target government spending on education and infrastructure investment . 
On the other side , Robert Mundell , Myron Scholes , and Reinhard Selten have called for &quot; draconian measures &quot; to tame debt levels . 
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) that Obama passed barely three weeks after his inauguration was disappointing . 
An $ 800 billion stimulus did not have the effect for which its proponents hoped , largely because it was accompanied by a big increase in private savings . 
Backers of the stimulus plan now claim that things would have been much worse without ARRA . 
I am skeptical . 
A better approach to reducing unemployment would be a new and expanded round of quantitative easing . 
I am heartened by calls for this in the UK , and that the talk is now turning to the purchase of risky assets , such as corporate bonds or bundles of loans to the private sector , as opposed to long-term government securities . 
This is a step in the right direction that I have been advocating for the past three years . 
But I would go even further . 
It supports the purchase of equities by central banks to reduce asset-price volatility , restore the value of wealth , and prevent a future market crash . 
When businessmen and women are afraid , they stop investing in real assets . 
Lack of confidence is reflected in low and volatile asset values . 
The environment of fear that arises has little to do with bad government policies , although bad policy may exacerbate the situation . 
Businessmen and women become afraid that stocks , and the values of the machines and factories that back those stocks , may fall further . 
Fear feeds on itself , and the prediction that stocks will lose value becomes self-fulfilling . 
The 2008 recession was triggered by the collapse of a real-estate bubble . 
Housing wealth in the US has fallen by 34 % since its peak in 2006 , and is still declining . 
The stock market fell by almost 50 % from its 2007 peak and remains down by nearly a third . 
This enormous loss of wealth caused a large and persistent drop in consumption demand , which has led to an increase in unemployment . 
Until we are willing to explore new solutions , the misery experienced by millions of unemployed workers will continue . 
A quantitative-easing policy in which a central bank buys risky assets can prevent price fluctuations and restore the value of financial wealth . 
These purchases would need Treasury support , since this tactic is in effect a fiscal policy , not a monetary policy . 
And , by involving the Treasury , the purchase of risky assets could be financed by issuing debt , rather than by printing more money , thereby attenuating inflationary fears . 
The Great Recession did not turn into Great Depression II because of coordinated action by governments around the world . 
Although fiscal expansion may have played a role in this success , central bank intervention was the most important component by far . 
Quantitative easing works by increasing the value of wealth . 
In both the US and the UK , it reduced the real expected return on long-term government bonds , which in turn nurtured a recovery in the stock market . 
We need not tolerate 9 % unemployment as the new normal . 
Confidence is a self-fulfilling prophecy , and we can , and should , manage it by direct intervention in asset markets . 
The way ahead leads through science , not ideology , dogma , or failed theories .
