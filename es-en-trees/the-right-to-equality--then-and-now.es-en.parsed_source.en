The Right to Equality , Then and Now 
LONDON - Following weeks of financial and economic turmoil , public debate has finally turned to the horrific potential human ramifications of the collapse of the global financial system . 
Comparisons and contrasts with the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s have inevitably become a central part of that discourse - and rightly so . 
There is much that the world can and must learn now from the lowest point of the twentieth century . 
Above all , we have got to heed the proven need for applying social - as well as economic - interventions in a time of economic crisis . 
Recession and depression can lead to exclusion and , at worst , persecution of societies &quot; most vulnerable groups . 
That is why the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights was adopted in 1948 , and why we need , more urgently than ever , to establish universal equality for all human beings . 
Nations must act now to ensure that everyone - regardless of wealth , ethnicity , sex , or religion - has the same rights , and that these rights are enshrined in laws at the time they are enacted . 
This October , 128 leading experts in the fields of human rights and equality from 44 countries launched a landmark attempt to build on the epochal 1948 UN declaration to establish universal human equality . 
We did so by launching a &quot; Declaration on Principles of Equality &quot; - a declaration that builds on its historical precursor to establish , for the first time ever , general legal principles that define equality as a basic human right . 
Based on a total of 27 principles , the Declaration reflects a moral and professional consensus among human rights and equality experts and is the product of more than a year &apos;s work led by the United Kingdom-based Equal Rights Trust . 
Needless to say , reaching a consensus among such a diverse group of people from around the world was not easy . 
Equality means different things to different people - and at different times . 
Interpretations largely depend on the practical realities of the social , cultural , and political environment in which the principles of equality operate . 
All signatories to our new Declaration agreed that incitement to violence that is motivated by race or gender or sexual orientation constitutes a serious violation of the right to equality . 
Some American civil rights lawyers , out of natural deference to the United States Constitution &apos;s First Amendment were , however , reluctant to sign up to this principle unless it was qualified by a reference to the threat of &quot; imminent &quot; violence . 
Some participants from the developing countries wanted poverty to be declared a proscribed basis of discrimination , while others argued that poverty is far too vague a concept to be the subject of legal rights and duties . 
Some contended that absolute poverty differs from relative poverty , or asked what responsibility individuals have to raise themselves out of poverty through education and work ? 
These participants argued that specific legal duties , such as the right to a minimum wage and the right to vocational training , are more effective than the vague extension of anti-discrimination law to cover poverty as such . 
The result was a compromise between these two groups . 
For all these differences of opinion , we are unanimous in the belief that , if the Principles of Equality are to be effective in our age , they have to go well beyond the negative anti-discrimination model that was adopted in the US and Europe in the second half of the twentieth century . 
They must , instead , encourage nations positively to promote the principle of equal rights in keeping with current interpretations of international obligation . 
The declaration that we have developed regards equality as a &quot; freestanding right . &quot; 
In other words , it exists as a separate right , and is not dependent on the violation of some other legal right , such as the right to education . 
It follows , then , that the right to equality could be violated even where another legal right - to , say , housing or employment - does not exist . 
The right to equality would exist in all areas of activity regulated by domestic , international or regional law . 
It would apply to everyone , regardless of nationality or statelessness , including refugees and asylum seekers , and it would place a positive obligation on states to &quot; promote and fulfill &quot; the right to equality . 
A new declaration was badly needed when we began work on it one year ago . 
Today , it is crucial if we are to prevent an even greater chasm from dividing the world &apos;s haves and have-nots .
