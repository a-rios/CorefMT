The Khmer Rouge in the Dock 
These days suspected war criminals - from Rwanda to Serbia to Sierra Leone - are in the dock . 
Dozens are still on the run , but hope remains that they , too , will face justice . 
This is not true of the perpetrators of the Cambodian genocide of the 1970 &apos;s . 
They remain free , and nobody is looking for them . 
A quarter of Cambodia &apos;s population of eight million was executed , starved to death , or succumbed to disease during the Khmer Rouge &apos;s rule from 1975-79 . 
There has been no real trial , no truth commission , and no official acknowledgement of one of the most heinous crimes in human history . 
As a result , many Cambodians born since 1979 do not understand the scope and gravity of the atrocities . 
Meanwhile , the anguish and sorrow of survivors - almost all of whom lost loved ones - have not found redress . 
This may be about to change . 
A year ago , the United Nations and the Royal Government of Cambodia agreed in principle to establish an &quot; Extraordinary Chambers &quot; composed of Cambodian and international prosecutors and judges to investigate and try the &quot; senior leaders of Democratic Kampuchea and those who were most responsible for crimes &quot; under Khmer Rouge rule . 
Ratification of the agreement has been delayed by the stalemate among Cambodia &apos;s bickering political parties following last year &apos;s elections . 
But a breakthrough appears close . 
To implement it , however , a number of hurdles remain to be overcome . 
The first obstacle is cost . 
Cambodian authorities can help build their credibility by curbing the temptation to pad bills and inflate salaries . 
But outsiders will inevitably bear the lion &apos;s share of the budget for the tribunal . 
The current estimate - $ 50 million over three years - has shocked donor governments . 
The price is appropriate . 
The United States and other western governments fueled Cambodia &apos;s civil war in the 1970 &apos;s , then lent the Khmer Rouge legitimacy in the 1980 &apos;s by insisting that they continue to occupy Cambodia &apos;s seat at the UN . 
If the Khmer Rouge trials are to proceed , donor countries must see the Extraordinary Chambers as a prudent investment toward a stable and productive Cambodia . 
Given how long it has taken to get this far , donors must act quickly to come up with the necessary funds . 
The second hurdle stems from the fact that Cambodia &apos;s tribunal will be the first internationalized court in which domestic judges form a majority . 
There is thus concern that some in Cambodia &apos;s government - which includes officials who once served under the Khmer Rouge - will seek to hijack the trials for political ends . 
In order to ensure a credible process , Cambodia and the UN must select judges of the highest caliber , not those that toe a party line . 
Prosecutors must follow the evidence wherever it leads . 
The trials should be conducted transparently and with broad public involvement . 
Non-governmental monitors need to scrutinize the proceedings to ensure that errors are identified early enough to be corrected . 
The UN must make clear that it will halt the tribunal if it falls short of international standards . 
The third hurdle is the danger that the Extraordinary Chambers will be regarded as the end rather than the beginning of a long-term search for accountability and legal reform . 
Given time and resource constraints , it is unlikely that more than a dozen defendants will be tried . 
Their many victims will rightly seek some form of accounting - at a minimum , an official record of the crimes they suffered . 
Before long , an effort to document and publish the truth will be necessary . 
Done properly , the proceedings of the Extraordinary Chambers could have further positive ramifications by contributing to lasting changes in Cambodia &apos;s ordinary courts . 
By highlighting positive models of judging and legal advocacy , the trials may stimulate public demand for domestic tribunals that dispense justice fairly and effectively . 
Cambodia &apos;s government and international donors should respond to this demand by launching reform programs that extend beyond the life of the Extraordinary Chambers . 
The Khmer Rouge prosecutions will not be perfect . 
Pol Pot died in 1998 , but aging senior associates like &quot; Brother Number Two &quot; Nuon Chea and ex-Khmer Rouge president Khieu Samphan live freely in Cambodia . 
With sufficient resources , and a determination not to compromise on quality , the Extraordinary Chambers can provide a measure of justice for the victims and an example of law &apos;s power to serve the public good .
