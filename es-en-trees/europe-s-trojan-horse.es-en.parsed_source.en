Europe &apos;s Trojan Horse There will be emergency financing . 
There will be conditions . 
There will be the obligatory promises by the government in Athens . 
This will make it possible for the Greek government to service its debt . 
The markets will settle down . 
The longer-term consequences will not be savory , but they will be problems for another day . 
Some will say that the fatal mistake was allowing Greece to adopt the euro in the first place . 
That the country was unprepared should have been clear . 
Its fiscal policies were already out of control when it joined the monetary union in 2001 , and its trade unions were agitating to push wages up to European levels , despite lagging productivity . 
But this answer is too simple , given that such signs of dysfunction are not limited to Greece . 
Spain , with its 20 % unemployment rate and exploding budget deficit , sees in Greece an image of its own future . 
Or , if it doesn &apos;t , the markets do . 
Portugal and Italy are little better . 
Like Greece , these countries now face sharp budget cuts . 
Like Greece , they face deep recessions . 
Like Greece , they will be tempted to ask for help . 
All of this raises the obvious question : Was the real mistake creating the euro in the first place ? 
Since I was one of the few Americans to advocate a single European currency , you would be justified in asking : Am I having second thoughts ? 
My answer is no , creating the euro was not a mistake , but it could still be a mistake in the making . 
The Greek crisis shows that Europe is still only halfway toward creating a viable monetary union . 
If it stays put , the next crisis will make this one look like a walk in the park . 
Completing its monetary union requires Europe to create a proper emergency financing mechanism . 
Currently , other member states can provide assistance to Greece only by bending the rules , which prevent them from lending except in response to natural disasters or circumstances beyond a country &apos;s control . 
This heightens uncertainty . 
When Europe &apos;s leaders do help , it makes the public and markets think that they are being dishonest . 
If it is the Lisbon Treaty that creates these problems , then the Lisbon Treaty should be changed . 
Moreover , assistance should come not just with conditions , but with temporary control of the national budget by a committee of &quot; special masters &quot; appointed by the European Union . 
Mere promises by the recipient , history tells us , are not enough . 
No doubt , countries to which these measures are applied will express outrage . 
Well , no one is forcing them to take the money . 
Worried about moral hazard ? 
Here &apos;s your solution . 
Note also that this would also be a much more effective disciplining mechanism than the defunct Stability and Growth Pact . 
You might well ask : how would Californians feel if their state was forced to turn over its budget temporarily to a special master appointed by President Barack Obama &apos;s administration ? 
Actually , they would probably feel okay . 
The special master would not be a fellow Californian , but he would be a fellow American . 
People would understand that he was acting in the interest of the state as well as the country . 
They would also be reassured by the fact that California sends representatives to Washington , D.C. , where the special master &apos;s marching orders would be issued . 
Europeans don &apos;t do these things because they see themselves as Greeks and Germans first . 
They don &apos;t interfere in the &quot; sovereign prerogatives &quot; of other member states . 
Germany is especially reluctant , given memories of its World War II conduct , not least in Greece . 
Well , if Europe is serious about its monetary union , it will have to get over its past . 
It needs not just closer economic ties , but also closer political ties . 
Those running a strong emergency financing mechanism will have to be strongly accountable . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s constituents hate bailouts , because they know that it is they who will be doing the bailing . 
They oppose anything that smacks of European political integration . 
But Germany is not innocent of responsibility for this crisis . 
It demanded an extraordinarily independent and unaccountable central bank that is now running an excessively tight monetary policy , aggravating the plight of the PIIGS ( Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece , and Spain ) . 
Germany &apos;s enormous current-account surplus aggravates their problems further . 
Germany has also done too little in terms of fiscal stimulus to support the European economy . 
Germany has benefited enormously from the creation of the euro . 
It should repay the favor . 
It should provide more fiscal support . 
And who better to press for a more accountable European Central Bank ? 
The Greek crisis could be the Trojan horse that leads Europe toward deeper political integration . 
One can only hope .
