The Cracks in the G-20 
MADRID - The world financial crisis has served as a quick and efficient catalyst to the G-20 . 
The first three G-20 summits of chiefs of state , in Washington , London , and Pittsburgh , will be remembered for advancing multilateralism and coordinated global action . 
The G-20 summit in Washington in 2008 was the first at which the member countries &quot; chiefs of state met since the group &apos;s creation in 1997 . 
The G-8 was no longer an appropriate vehicle for global economic governance , given the need to stabilize financial markets around the world . 
The voices of countries such as China , India , and Brazil had to be heard if a coordinated response to the crisis was to be found . 
With the financial crisis worsening , the London summit in 2009 agreed to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus and backed a stronger , more coherent regulatory and supervisory framework worldwide . 
In view of the G-20 &quot; s success , the Pittsburgh summit recognized it as the main forum for international economic cooperation . 
This recognition raised expectations for the G-20 and granted it the prestige that it deserved : it is the only forum in which world powers and emerging countries sit as equals at the same table . 
The premise is clear : as the crisis made more evident than ever , the interdependence of countries is inescapable . 
In the face of today &apos;s global challenges , the only possible response must be global . 
There is no possible alternative . 
Two clearly defined gaps stand out as causes of discord . 
The first is transatlantic divergence over how best to assure a return to solid growth . 
The United States favors continuing economic stimulus , while the European Union prefers fiscal consolidation . 
The other source of dissension is disagreement over a bank tax . 
The US , the EU , and Japan are in favor , while emerging countries , as well as Canada and Australia , are opposed . 
While an agreement has been reached ( 2013 has been set as the year to reduce budget deficits by half ; 2016 to stabilize sovereign debt ) , consensus is not headed in the right direction . 
It is not a question of stimulus versus deficit . 
Both are necessary . 
Even respecting the idiosyncrasies of each context , there is still sufficient common ground for more precision in the agreements . 
The same can be said for transparency , accountability , and regulation of the bank tax . 
I know very well that this is not an easy task , but it is essential for world leaders - not markets - to lead reforms . 
Moreover , a custom has been repeated that should be changed . 
Obviously , holding a G-8 summit just before a G-20 summit , as happened in Canada this June , simply serves to prolong maintenance of separate clubs , which is unsustainable . 
The G-20 &quot; s role should increase further in importance , owing to emerging countries &quot; share of global GDP - projected to reach 60 % in 2030 - and to the global nature of the challenges of the twenty-first century . 
If we want to make progress on global governance problems we will have to work together on getting through this economic crisis and on other essential issues , such as nuclear non-proliferation . 
The problem is that , despite the clear need for multilateralism , there is a risk of a relapse into bilateralism due to a lack of global leadership . 
The attention of US President Barack Obama is centered on matters of great importance , such as the Middle East , his evolving strategy in Afghanistan , and the struggling American economy . 
The same is true of the EU , where attention - and action - has been centered in recent months on defending the euro and resolving the economic difficulties on the Union &apos;s periphery . 
Meanwhile , the emerging powers continue to lean toward bilateralism and are aligning themselves with other countries . 
Lack of agreement on the United Nations Security Council resolution against Iran does not help coordination and cooperation within the G-20 , either . 
Summits should be well prepared and provide a forum to debate today &apos;s great global issues . 
Coherent , well-defined , and precise proposals would produce results that are more acceptable to all . 
A G-20 summit is not something that happens every day . 
It is a global event . 
Especially in a time of crisis that has caused so much suffering , its decisions must be explained to the public clearly and without cacophony . 
People &apos;s anguish demands this effort , and it was lacking in Toronto . 
The world remains in a very delicate transitional phase , and it is not clear yet in which direction the G-20 will lean . 
The main challenge now is to continue using the &quot; geometry of 20 &quot; to build instruments of world governance . 
Although the economic storm has become less intense , it hasn &apos;t calmed yet . 
With countries headed toward growth at different speeds , global strategy must continue to be a priority .
