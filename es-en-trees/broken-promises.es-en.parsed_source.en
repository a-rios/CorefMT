Broken Promises 
PRINCETON - In 2000 , the world &apos;s leaders met in New York and issued a ringing Millennium Declaration , promising to halve the proportion of people suffering from extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 . 
They also pledged to halve the proportion of people without safe drinking water and sanitation ; move toward universal and full primary schooling for children everywhere - girls as well as boys ; reduce child mortality by two-thirds and maternal mortality by three-quarters ; and combat HIV / AIDS , malaria , and other major diseases . 
These pledges , reformulated as specific , measurable targets , became the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) . 
Last month , ten years on from that meeting , world leaders returned to New York for a United Nations summit that adopted a document called Keeping the Promise , which reaffirmed the commitment to meeting the goals by 2015 . 
The UN press release called the document a &quot; global action plan &quot; to achieve the MDGs , but it is more an expression of aspirations than a plan . 
What chance do we really have of keeping the promises made in 2000 ? 
As the Yale philosopher Thomas Pogge has pointed out , the task has been made easier by moving the goal posts . 
Even before 2000 , the World Food Summit , held in Rome in 1996 , pledged to halve the numberof undernourished people by 2015 . 
By contrast , the corresponding MDG was to halve the proportion of the world &apos;s people who are suffering from hunger ( as well as of those living in extreme poverty ) . 
Because the world &apos;s population is rising , halving the proportion of people suffering from hunger ( and extreme poverty ) means that the number will not be halved . 
But worse was to come . 
When the Millennium Declaration was rewritten as a set of specific goals , the baseline for calculating the proportion to be halved was set not at 2000 , but at 1990 . 
The net effect of all these changes , Pogge calculates , is that , whereas world leaders pledged in 1996 that by 2015 they would reduce the number of undernourished people to no more than 828 million , now they are pledging only to reduce the number in extreme poverty to 1.324 billion . 
Since extreme poverty is responsible for about one-third of all human deaths , this difference effectively means that - if the final promise is actually honored - each year about six million more people will die from poverty-related causes than would have died had the original promise made in Rome been kept . 
In any case , according to a recent World Bank / International Monetary Fund report , we are not on track to meet even the scaled-back global target of halving the proportion of hungry people in developing countries . 
Rising food prices - possibly related to climate change - have reversed past progress and last year briefly pushed the number suffering from hunger above the one-billion mark . 
That this should happen while developed nations waste hundreds of millions of tons of grain and soybeans by feeding them to animals , and obesity reaches epidemic proportions , undermines our claims to believe in the equal value of all human life . 
The target of halving the proportion of people in extreme poverty is within reach , but mainly because of economic progress in China and India . 
In Africa , after economic stagnation in the 1990 &quot; s , a decade of encouraging economic growth is reducing the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty , but not quickly enough to halve it by 2015 . 
There is better news on achieving gender parity in education , a key to reaching other goals , including lower infant mortality , which often comes about because educated women have fewer children . 
We also have a good chance of meeting the target of reducing by half the proportion of people in developing countries without safe drinking water - but to achieve the same with sanitation is proving more difficult . 
On health goals , however , we are not even close . 
Maternal mortality is falling , but not fast enough . 
More people with HIV / AIDS are getting inexpensive anti-retroviral drugs and their life-expectancy has increased , but universal access is still far off , and the disease is still spreading , if more slowly than before . 
Progress has been made in reducing malaria and measles , and the rate of child mortality has fallen partly as a result , but the goal of a two-thirds reduction will not be met . 
For a long time , rich countries have promised to reduce poverty , but have failed to match their words with adequate action . 
Of course , some important progress has been made . 
Millions of lives have been saved , but millions more could be saved . 
To make sustainable progress in reducing extreme poverty will require improvements in both the quantity and quality of aid . 
Just a handful of countries - Denmark , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Norway , and Sweden - have met or exceeded the UN &apos;s modest target of 0.7 % of GDP for foreign development assistance . 
But , without trade reform and action on climate change , more and better aid will not suffice . 
For now , it looks very much as if , come 2015 , the world &apos;s leaders will have failed to keep their ( watered-down ) promises .
