The Three Mis-Represents 
It is two years since the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) unveiled its new ideological credo , called the &quot; Three Represents . &quot; 
What good fortune it is that China &apos;s most sacred , encompassing , and powerful doctrine built around the triumvirate of &quot; the interests of the majority of the people &quot; &quot; advanced culture , &quot; and &quot; advanced productive forces &quot; found one political party to be its representative ! 
Good fortune , that is , for the CCP , not for China and its people . 
The &quot; Three Represents &quot; has several official versions , each including the words &quot; always , &quot; &quot; China , &quot; and &quot; represent . &quot; 
Their meaning is clear . 
On the other hand , &quot; majority of the people , &quot; &quot; advanced culture , &quot; and &quot; advanced productive forces , &quot; as well as some other phrases that dominate the doctrine , are vague , perhaps deliberately so . 
Common sense suggests that the &quot; majority of the people , &quot; whom the CCP is supposed to &quot; represent , &quot; should include workers . 
But the CCP long ago abandoned the workers . 
How many lost their jobs last month ? 
How many were forced to take early retirement ? 
How many mining accidents were there ? 
How many workers &apos; protests ? 
Who jailed their organizers ? 
The &quot; Representative of the Three Represents &quot; refuse to say . 
Workers who protest and strike are &quot; rioting . &quot; 
Whoever reports such events is &quot; anti-revolutionary . &quot; 
The same is true of the Party &apos;s relationship with the peasants , who provided Mao Zedong with the soldiers and supplies he needed in battles that lasted decades . 
Peasants followed Mao because the CCP promised them land . 
But Mao decided to take back the land from the peasants even before it was given to them . 
&quot; The serious problem is the education of the peasants , &quot; he said . 
The &quot; representatives &quot; of the peasants are the new landlords . 
In a China without democracy , student sentiment is a key political barometer . 
Unlike workers or peasants , students include people from all levels of society , so whatever mobilizes them represents society &apos;s focus at that time . 
From April 15th to June 4th , 1989 , students demonstrating in Tiananmen Square , and their supporters , conducted the saddest opinion poll in Chinese history , expressing a common will to end totalitarianism , build democracy , and eliminate corruption . 
Those who defend the Party &apos;s bloody crackdown of those students have no right to call themselves the representatives of the majority of the people . 
Their claim to be &quot; always representing the progressive direction of advanced culture &quot; is yet another grand and empty declaration . 
Chinese culture stretches three thousand years into the past and perhaps thousands of years into the future . 
Is it to be &quot; always represented &quot; by a lone political party ? 
I do not know what &quot; the progressive direction of advanced culture &quot; is , but advanced culture played no part in the CCP-inspired &quot; Wipe Out Poisonous Weeds Campaign , &quot; the &quot; Anti-Rightist Movement , &quot; or the &quot; Eliminate Demons and Evil Heresy Campaign . &quot; 
Such obscurantism only creates a culture of stultifying uniformity . 
Like a blade of grass beneath a stone , culture knows how and in which direction to seek light . 
It does not need to be &quot; represented . &quot; 
Of the three &quot; represents , &quot; the clearest meaning is to be found in the CCP &apos;s vow to &quot; always represent the demands of advanced productive forces . &quot; 
This means representing the interests of the da-kuan , those who suddenly became rich , usually through government connections . 
The phrase has no deeper meaning . 
The union of power and money in today &apos;s China originates from the steady inflation of bureaucracy . 
Before the Great Leap Forward , townships could barely afford a few full-time cadres . 
Today , each township has hundreds . 
Their basic salary is paid by the central government , but bonuses and extra benefits depend on contributions from the &quot; advanced productive forces &quot; at the county and township level . 
Whatever the rich ask of the CCP - land leases , low interest loans , violation of labor laws , environmental standards , contracts , and intellectual property - can be considered &quot; the demands of advanced productive forces . &quot; 
Even under less corrupt conditions , representing &quot; the most advanced productive forces &quot; is a flawed idea . 
Imagine that the Olympic Committee represented only the interests of gold medal winners , or that the Education Ministry represented only post-doctoral programs but ignored elementary schools . 
While the high-tech sector at the top of the economic pyramid is important , the traditional sectors at the bottom still form the foundation . 
What will become of several hundred million rural peasants and jobless workers in sunset industries ? 
Who will address inequality and divergent social interests ? 
An increasingly pluralistic society is being forced into a procrustean structure that allows only one voice , one need , and one kind of interest : the voice , needs , and interests of the party . 
But the theory of the Three Represents is nevertheless necessary , because a new situation has emerged . 
When the CCP came to power in 1948 , it could claim to embody socialism , Marxism , and the proletariat &apos;s historical mission . 
Fifty years later , socialism &apos;s advantages , Marxism &apos;s truth , and the proletarian character of the Party have all been unanswerably challenged . 
So the Three Represents is an effort to salvage one-party rule . 
You may doubt socialism , but you cannot doubt &quot; advanced productive forces . &quot; 
You may not believe in Marxism , but you must believe in &quot; advanced culture . &quot; 
The CCP no longer represents workers and peasants , but it can represent the &quot; majority of the people , &quot; including &quot; red &quot; capitalists . 
Indeed , whether CCP members who have become &quot; revolutionarily &quot; wealthy remain &quot; red &quot; is determined solely by their acceptance of one-party rule . 
Welcoming &quot; red capitalists &quot; therefore does not imply democratization . 
Such people are more likely to seek to strengthen their privileges than promote pluralism and the rule of law . 
Totalitarianism , not political reform , is their livelihood . 
It is this , above all else , that the theory of the Three Represents comprehends .
