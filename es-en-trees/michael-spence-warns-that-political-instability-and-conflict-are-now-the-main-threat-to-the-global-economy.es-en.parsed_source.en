The Global Security Deficit 
FORT LAUDERDALE - Summer is normally a time to take a break from the risks and worries of everyday life , and perhaps to take stock of where we are and where we are heading . 
Much of the discussion in the period following the 2008 financial crisis focused on various economic imbalances that either threatened or impeded growth . 
These issues have not gone away . 
The US economy &apos;s surprisingly weak performance in the first quarter , for example , has left analysts confused and uncertain about its trajectory . 
But , to an increasing extent , political insecurity , potential conflict , and deteriorating international relations pose a greater threat to economic progress than the post-crisis debate foresaw . 
Asia , a bright spot in terms of growth in the post-crisis years , is now experiencing rising tensions that jeopardize regional trade and growth . 
Japan &apos;s somewhat fragile recovery could be derailed by an escalation of its territorial conflict with China , which is both a major market for Japanese goods and deeply integrated into Japanese firms &quot; supply chains . 
While territorial disputes often are historically and politically important , their economic significance is usually minor , even minuscule , unless tensions like those in the East and South China Seas are allowed to get out of hand . 
America &apos;s ambiguous role in Asian security - owing to its interest in supporting its regional allies while not antagonizing China - contributes to the uncertainty . 
Aside from their strategic minuet in Asia , China and the United States are engaged in a cyber-security battle that is already starting to affect flows of goods , investment , and technology . 
On both sides , stated commitments to resolve the issue cooperatively have not produced significant results . 
The Middle East , meanwhile , has entered a period of extreme instability that will surely have negative economic effects both regionally and globally . 
The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine - and , more recently , the suspension of commercial flights to Tel Aviv - adds a new dimension of uncertainty . 
When civilian air traffic is no longer safe from attack , one may legitimately wonder about the effectiveness of the basic systems of governance that underpin global commerce . 
Indeed , the World Trade Organization is once again in jeopardy , with the Indian government threatening to veto the Agreement on Trade Facilitation reached in Bali last year , owing to disagreements about food stockpiling and subsidies . 
A loss of confidence in the WTO would be a major blow to an institution that plays a vital role in securing international cooperation and regulation . 
The global economy is a far more highly interconnected place than it was 40 years ago . 
The cross-border flows of goods , information , people , and capital that are its lifeblood rely on a threshold level of safety , stability , and predictability . 
It is this threshold that appears to be under threat . 
Continued economic progress in the developing world and recovery in the developed countries requires preventing local and regional conflict from delivering large systemic shocks . 
In terms of priorities , it is arguably more important for G-20 governments to strengthen the core systems that enable global flows than it is to address strictly economic issues . 
Moreover , there is a clear , shared interest in doing so : No one benefits from the expansion of systemic risk . 
Failure to contain the impact of regional conflicts and bilateral frictions may lead to more than just supply shocks in areas like energy . 
The principal effect is likely to be a series of negative demand shocks : investors withdrawing , travelers staying home , and consumers closing their wallets . 
In a global economy in which aggregate demand is a key growth constraint , that is the last thing the system needs . 
We have gone about as far as we can with a global system that is at best partly governed and regulated . 
As the global order defined by the Cold War ( and then by a briefly dominant America ) recedes into history , a new set of institutions and agreements must be developed to protect the core stability of the system . 
That is easier said than done . 
Ineffective regulation in areas like food safety , infectious diseases , cyber security , energy markets , and air safety , combined with the inability to manage regional tensions and conflict , will undermine global flows and reduce prosperity everywhere . 
In a way , the current global environment is a classic case of negative externalities . 
The localized costs of suboptimal behavior - the ones one might expect to be internalized - fall well short of the overall global costs . 
Several more narrowly economic issues - for example , defective growth patterns , underinvestment in tangible and intangible assets , and the absence of reforms designed to increase structural flexibility - remain a cause for concern , because they underpin subpar growth . 
But , at this moment in history , the main threats to prosperity - those that urgently need world leaders &quot; attention and effective international cooperation - are the huge uncontained negative spillover effects of regional tensions , conflict , and competing claims to spheres of influence . 
The most powerful impediment to growth and recovery is not this or that economic imbalance ; it is a loss of confidence in the systems that made rising global interdependence possible .
