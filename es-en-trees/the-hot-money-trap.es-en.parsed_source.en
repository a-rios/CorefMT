The Hot Money Trap 
SHANGHAI - The recent financial crisis has seen Asia emerge as an economic powerhouse - indeed , as a key driver of global growth . 
Within five years or so , Asia &apos;s total economy could be as large as that of the United States and the European Union combined . 
Indeed , while Asia is rising , the rich industrial countries of the old G-7 have been drifting into a liquidity trap . 
As the ongoing recession exhausts the traditional instruments of monetary policy , central banks are opting for new rounds of quantitative easing ( QE ) . 
And , with investors seeking higher returns , more QE - especially by the US - will drive &quot; hot money &quot; ( short-term portfolio flows ) into high-yield emerging-market economies , which could inflate dangerous asset bubbles in Asia , Latin America , and elsewhere . 
The US Federal Reserve and the Obama administration remain rhetorically wedded to maintaining a &quot; strong dollar . &quot; 
But it is the dollar &apos;s weakness that has boosted US corporate earnings since the crisis erupted , propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 11,000 for the first time since May . 
Since early 2002 , the dollar has fallen by one-third against major currencies , and recently this decline has intensified . 
Since the end of August , when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued for another round of QE , the dollar has plunged more than 7 % against a basket of half a dozen major currencies . 
Inflation-protected securities are now being sold at negative yields for the first time ever . 
Following the mid-term elections and the resurgence of the Republicans in the US Congress , the Fed &apos;s decision to pump $ 600 billion into the economy by mid-2011 is likely to trigger similar actions in the United Kingdom , Japan , and other advanced economies . 
Moreover , the Fed has left the door open to more quantitative easing next year - a tacit acknowledgement that the recovery will be long and sluggish . 
But the effect of a new round of QE on interest rates could be small and limited to an announcement effect , as the Fed &apos;s own research indicates . 
In fact , the full impact of America &apos;s &quot; QE2 &quot; will not be domestic , because the net effect will be a weaker dollar as speculators bet on its decline . 
Successive waves of QE would amount to debasing the value of the dollar , and thus inflating away massive US debts . 
Meanwhile , developing countries are moving in the opposite direction . 
In October , the People &apos;s Bank of China , responding to the twin threats of inflation and asset bubbles , raised its one-year deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points , to 2.5 % and 5.56 % , respectively - the first increases since 2007 . 
In the West , concerns about the impact on Chinese growth triggered a fearful sell-off in the markets . 
Right before the Fed acted , the Reserve Bank of India raised its benchmark short-term interest rate by 25 basis points , to 6.25 % , to fight inflation , and China &apos;s central bank now indicates that it might raise interest rates further . 
In Brazil , interest rates remain close to 11 % . 
After the Fed &apos;s QE move , Brazil is preparing to retaliate . 
&quot; It &apos;s no use throwing dollars out of a helicopter , &quot; as Brazilian Minister of Finance Guido Mantega put it . 
Soon afterward , Germany &apos;s finance minister called US policy &quot; clueless , &quot; while his South African counterpart thought that the Fed &apos;s move undermined the G-20 leaders &quot; &quot; spirit of multilateral cooperation . &quot; 
Today , a deepening global divide sets the slow-growing US against many emerging-market economies and commodity-producing countries . 
The worldwide impact of QE has only aggravated the chasm , reflected by the rifts among the G-20 nations . 
As the Fed exhausts the power of traditional monetary instruments , it is heading into uncharted territory , with the potential of unpredictable outcomes and unprecedented collateral damage . 
There is also the risk of a disruptive decline in the dollar , which could prompt investors to flee US debt . 
In his famous 2002 speech on the potential of deflation in America , Bernanke suggested that Franklin Delano Roosevelt &apos;s 40 % devaluation of the dollar in 1933-1934 shows that exchange-rate policy can be an &quot; effective weapon against deflation . &quot; 
Today , however , global economic integration and interdependence are much deeper than in the 1930 &quot; s . 
As Chen Deming , China &apos;s Minister of Commerce , recently complained , &quot; The United States &quot; issuance of dollars is out of control and international commodity prices are continuing to rise . &quot; 
As a result , &quot; China is being attacked by imported inflation . &quot; 
The impact of the Fed &apos;s policy and hot money has been dramatic . 
In the third quarter of this year , China &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves increased by $ 194 billion , which far exceeded the country &apos;s $ 66 billion trade surplus and $ 23 billion in inflows of foreign direct investment . 
At least part of the difference can be attributed to &quot; hot money . &quot; 
Most importantly , a disruptive decline of the US dollar ( or a disruptive appreciation of the Chinese renminbi ) could hinder not only China &apos;s growth , but also global recovery . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , emerging and developing economies were still dependent on G-7 growth . 
In the past decade , these countries have , as OECD research has shown , become dependent on Chinese growth . 
Any decline in China &apos;s growth would thus significantly undermine poverty reduction in the emerging world . 
During George W. Bush &apos;s presidency , unilateral security policies left America without friends . 
In the Obama era , unilateral economic policies may have the same result . 
In a global economy , the decisions of the leading countries &quot; central banks have global implications . 
And , in a world where the G-7 no longer drives global growth , printing money is playing with fire .
