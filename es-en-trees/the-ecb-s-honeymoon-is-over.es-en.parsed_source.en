The ECB &apos;s Honeymoon is Over 
The honeymoon for the European Central Bank is over . 
Because European interest rates no longer are clearly out of whack with the fundamentals of the euro-zone economy , monetary policy has become more complex . 
At the same time , France has given a strong mandate to its new president , Nicolas Sarkozy , who is without question the most formidable political adversary the ECB has had to face in its brief history . 
Sarkozy stands ready to pounce on any mistakes the Bank may make in this more difficult policy environment . 
With European interest rates up 200 basis points since late 2005 and the euro near a record high , Sarkozy wants the ECB to stop raising rates now . 
ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet and the Governing Council strongly disagree . 
At the ECB press conference in early July , Trichet signaled at least one more rate hike - either in September or October . 
Some Council members are known to support two more rate hikes before year-end . 
What makes monetary policy tricky at this point is that the German economy - which has been Europe &apos;s locomotive during the current cyclical upturn - may be reaching a turning point . 
Surveys of business and investor confidence have softened - the respected IFO index of German business sentiment fell from 107.0 to 106.4 in Julyamp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; and the so-called &quot; hard data &quot; - industrial production , retail sales , etc.amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; - has been mixed . 
Second quarter German GDP has stalled after a surprisingly strong first quarter . 
The jury is out but there is reason to be concerned . 
The euro is at record levels , oil prices are surging and interest rates are expected to go higher . 
The euro-zone economy - including Germany &apos;samp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; is not bulletproof though the hawks in the Governing Council often talk as if it were . 
Just as last year when there was unwarranted growth pessimism in Europe , this year there is unwarranted growth euphoria . 
Many Germans , in particular , are in denial that the cyclical upturn may be coming to an end . 
Were the Governing Council to miss the coming turn in the European economy while blithely raising interest rates , they would be portrayed as drunken sailors on a rate-raising binge . 
The roar for greater political control over Europe &apos;s central bank would be deafening - and not only from France . 
The political costs for the ECB of making this type of mistake could be exorbitant . 
This is why the ECB must be very prudent as it considers whether to maintain the current pace of rate hikes , in which case it would raise rates by 25 basis points in September , or slow the pace down a bit , in which case the next rate hike would come in October at the earliest . 
In the current political environment , the dangers to the ECB from outside political interference are much greater from raising rates too fast than too slowly . 
If it goes too slow , the ECB has earned sufficient credibility as an inflation fighter to make up for it in the future with little if any economic or political cost . 
But if it goes too fast , the political cost could be substantial and irreversible . 
Politicians will push for more control and probably get it , Maastricht treaty or no Maastricht treaty . 
Waiting until October for the next move up is like buying insurance against a catastrophic loss . 
But will the ECB see it this way ? 
As a matter of principle , the hawks refuse to consider the political costs of their actions . 
In earlier times with no formidable adversaries in the political arena , this was a harmless affectation . 
But it is an extremely dangerous attitude with people like Sarkozy ready , willing and able to impose high political costs upon the bank should it stumble . 
There is more interest in Sarkozy &apos;s populist ideas about currency intervention and adding a new political dimension to monetary policy decisions than is commonly realized . 
The hawks also suffer from what can be called a &quot; catch up &quot; complex . 
No matter how high rates go , they think they &apos;re behind . 
They want to go in September so that they can go again in December ( even before knowing the data ) - and they won &apos;t stop there either . 
Even the doves might support a rate hike in September to counter-act the charge that they are being bullied out of a September hike by Sarkozy . 
There is no doubt that Sarkozy &apos;s attacks on the ECB are having a counter-productive effect in this regard . 
They are pressuring the ECB to raise rates sooner than later . 
But a September rate move also serves Sarkozy &apos;s interests , as it will give him more ammunition to portray the ECB as out of control and in need of political disciplining . 
For the ECB to protect itself from such charges , far better to wait until October when the bank can go to the public and say in effect ; 
&quot; Look , do you see how reasonable we have been . 
Now we must raise rates . &quot; 
But this is a big &quot; if . &quot; 
The fight is on between the two French titans - Trichet and Sarkozy - with the fate of Europe &apos;s central bank hanging in the balance .
