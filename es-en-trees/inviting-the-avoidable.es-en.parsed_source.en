Inviting the Avoidable 
Maybe it is excessive skittishness , or perhaps it is the result of global financial volatility in recent years - crises in Mexico in 1994-5 , East Asia in 1997-98 , Russia in 1998 , and then in Brazil , Turkey , and Argentina - but we economists are more concerned about monetary affairs and possible future disasters than we have been in many decades . 
This month , the Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) was the latest to worry aloud about the financial risks that the world seems to be building into its future . 
&quot; &#91; A &#93; ll the countries hit by financial crisis ... experience &#91; d &#93; a very sharp slowdown , &quot; the BIS says of the recent past . 
It then cites &quot; global current account imbalances , &quot; particularly &quot; the US external deficit , &quot; describing it as &quot; unprecedented for a reserve currency country to have a current account deficit of such magnitude . &quot; 
In short , the world has become &quot; increasingly prone to financial turbulence . &quot; 
The BIS hints at the possibility of a financial crisis that , with the US at its center , would dwarf by at least an order of magnitude all crises that have occurred since 1933 . 
Yet , in response to this risk , the BIS issues the standard textbook recommendations . 
Countries whose policies and economies are out of balance should change their policies , thereby restoring balance : &quot; deficit countries should reduce the rate of growth of domestic spending below that of domestic production . 
Allowing their currencies to depreciate in real terms would make their products more competitive , and also provide an incentive for production to shift out of non-tradables into tradables . &quot; 
This is economists &quot; polite code for the message that the US must gradually cut its budget deficit , while other countries - like China and Japan - must gradually let the value of the dollar fall and that of their own currencies rise . 
So the BIS proposes nothing new or particularly attention-grabbing . 
But if we turn to America &apos;s government , we see an enormous pretense that the current budget deficit is not a problem . 
As Stan Collender , a noted observer of the US federal budget , has commented , &quot; No one with federal budget responsibilities actually seems to be interested in the budget . &quot; 
This is not &quot; because the budget committees are too busy .... &#91; T &#93; he House and Senate ... are not doing much of anything ... &#91; because &#93; they don &apos;t want to . &quot; 
Within the Bush administration , Director of the Office of Management and Budget Josh Bolten &quot; has been virtually invisible , &quot; while &quot; the president and vice president ... avoid talking publicly about the budget . &quot; 
Let us be clear on this point : it is not that politicians who wish to take the lead on fiscal consolidation are failing to gain traction ; it is that there are no politicians - at least none with any agenda-setting influence - who are even trying to steer the US towards adopting a more responsible fiscal policy . 
This is a grotesque failure of leadership . 
Governments that pursue policies - whether US fiscal laxity or China &apos;s exchange-rate peg - that create unsustainable imbalances do so for what they regard as important political reasons . 
Appeals to them to change their policies , and thus contribute to the common global good of financial stability , are fruitless unless others are seen to change their policies , act responsibly , and so contribute to the common good as well . 
International policy coordination requires a leader , a first mover . 
Treasury Secretary John Snow has spent almost no public time on the budget , but a lot of public time on China . 
Republican political operatives care far less about national savings than they do about manufacturing-sector job losses . 
&quot; So what else is new ? &quot; you may ask - and with good reason . 
The list of issues on which the Bush administration has failed to lead is a long one , and failure to take steps to diminish the risks of future financial catastrophe cannot rank very high . 
The entire Bush administration has been a succession of leadership failures , so why harp on its poor financial management ? 
Form a purely practical point of view , one reason is that ensuring global financial stability is an issue on which real progress can be made relatively easily . 
The Bush administration may not care that deficit reduction is the right policy for America , but it might care far more if the issue were framed as a prerequisite for policy changes abroad that diminish pressure from imports on domestic manufacturing employment .
