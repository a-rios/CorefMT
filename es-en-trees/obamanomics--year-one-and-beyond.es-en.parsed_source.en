Obamanomics : Year One and Beyond 
BERKELEY - President Barack Obama has not had an easy first year economically . 
He inherited a financial system on the verge of collapse . 
He was bequeathed an economy in recession and an unemployment rate destined to rise . 
And he faced a Congress and an economics profession with a tendency to confuse these real demons with imaginary ones . 
His strength has been not to allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good . 
His $ 787 billion fiscal stimulus was good . 
To be sure , it was based on unrealistically optimistic assumptions about the depth of the recession , the strength of the recovery , and the level at which unemployment would peak . 
It was too heavily tilted toward tax cuts that would tend to boost saving rather than consumption . 
And , unaccompanied by a credible medium-term fiscal strategy , it unnecessarily excited the apostles of fiscal doom . 
But , having said all that , the stimulus package gave the economy a necessary shot in the arm . 
Obama &apos;s efforts to stabilize the banking system , it almost pains me to acknowledge , succeeded despite themselves . 
I would have preferred bigger capital injections . 
I would have liked to see his administration use its leverage to replace the management responsible for creating the financial mess in the first place . 
But the stress tests and targeted TARP money , the path of least resistance taken , enabled the banks to earn their way back to solvency . 
However distasteful the uses to which those earnings have been put , they at least prevented the financial system from falling off a cliff . 
Finally , Obama &apos;s Quaker-meeting approach to legislating health-care reform has produced , of all things , health-care reform . 
For the end of the story we will have to wait and see what emerges from the House-Senate reconciliation process . 
But it will certainly prevent the insurance companies from denying coverage on grounds of preexisting conditions . 
It will address adverse selection by including an individual mandate . 
And it will subsidize insurance coverage for the poor . 
While it will presumably lack the public option many of us prefer , this is still a real achievement . 
The same middle-of-the-road approach can be taken in the second year to address the still-outstanding fiscal issues . 
Obama can use his State of the Union message to flesh out a bipartisan strategy for narrowing the budget deficit to sustainable levels . 
This would entail reinstating pay-as-you-go rules and establishing an independent commission to submit to Congress amendment-proof ( and filibuster-proof ) recommendations for tax and expenditure reform . 
But Obama needs to provide stronger leadership on financial reform , where , as with health care , there is a welter of conflicting proposals . 
There are two reasons to doubt that the light-touch approach used in the case of health care is appropriate to reforming financial regulation . 
First , unlike health care , where we can afford to proceed incrementally , the need for comprehensive financial reform is pressing . 
If health-insurance exchanges don &apos;t work , we can always reconsider the public option . 
But if the initial approach to financial reform doesn &apos;t work , we face the prospect of another financial crisis every bit as serious as the last . 
Second , health care had effective proponents - in Congress , among consumers , and even among some of its providers . 
Medium-term fiscal reform , for its part , will be pushed by bond-market vigilantes . 
But financial reform is too technical for non-specialists . 
And the specialists , the financiers themselves , prefer a status quo that rewards them lavishly . 
This is one area where Obama &apos;s consensual instincts do not serve him well . 
He needs to use his bully pulpit . 
He needs to mobilize the general interest effectively . 
Finally , in his second year , Obama must , as he put it last summer in a speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , &quot; aim higher . &quot; 
He was elected not simply because he is a cool crisis manager , but because he had a vision for a more economically just society . 
Now that the time for crisis management is , one hopes , over , he needs to flesh out and implement that vision . 
The time for any old kind of public spending simply to support aggregate demand , if not already over , soon will be . 
The need then will be for more spending on education and training - the only thing that in the long run will make American workers more productive and reduce income inequality . 
Similarly , the United States needs more productivity-enhancing infrastructure - roads , bridges , and ports - and not frills such as high-speed trains between Sacramento and San Diego . 
Only measures like these can create the good jobs that will reduce income inequality and make America again resemble a normal advanced economy , not one where inequality approaches Latin American levels . 
But more spending on these items will require less spending on other things - or higher taxes . 
America &apos;s consensus-oriented president needs to make that case .
