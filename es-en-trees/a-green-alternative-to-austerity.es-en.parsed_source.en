A Green Alternative to Austerity ? 
OXFORD - While austerity in Europe faces increasing social resistance , in principle it has the merit of simplicity . 
As the debate on fiscal consolidation versus growth intensifies , it is clear that there is little agreement on how to kick-start the economy , beyond fielding broad stimulus packages . 
One idea is that environmental technology might feed a virtuous cycle of innovation and employment . 
To some , green growth evokes a countryside covered with windmills and urban roofs lined with solar panels . 
For example , when Airbus moved from injection molding to 3D printing to produce the metal hinges for its airplanes &quot; doors , it reduced their weight by half , yielding phenomenal savings in material and associated fuel consumption over a lifetime of flying those hinges around the world . 
Still , it is easier to find exciting anecdotes than it is to show how they scale up to revitalizing an entire economy . 
Moreover , there is a great diversity of narratives on the green economy - and their proliferation is likely to grow . 
This June , thousands of activists , policymakers , and business people will converge on Rio de Janeiro for the third giant United Nations Sustainable Development Conference ( Rio + 20 ) , whose theme is the green economy . 
The conference will unleash new arguments about green jobs , growth , cost increases , cost reductions , changes in values , consumer choice - green this and green that . 
As a co-author of A New Growth Path for Europe , a report commissioned by the German government , I am guilty of contributing to this cacophony of complementary perspectives on green growth . 
The European Climate Foundation had already published its Roadmap 2050 , A Practical Guide to a Prosperous , Low-Carbon Europe . 
Since then , the UN Environment Program has released its Green Economy Report ; 
McKinsey has written about the Resource Revolution ; and the International Trade Unions Council has published Growing Green and Decent Jobs - to name but a few . 
All take somewhat different approaches and offer different recommendations , making it hard for policymakers to see the forest through the trees . 
And , at the root of this multiplicity of perspectives lays the fact that economics struggles to explain how growth and innovation move an economy as a whole . 
The macroeconomic models on which policymakers depend are solid tools in times of smooth and incremental evolution , but green growth is not about gradual change . 
For example , the European Union &apos;s goal of achieving an 80 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 implies a complete overhaul of EU infrastructure in just a few decades . 
Economists &quot; inability to model such rapid , radical change should not be taken as a condemnation of the discipline ; it is simply a reflection of the state of our knowledge , and of the fact that the economy is really , really complicated . 
We simply do not yet have sufficiently precise insights into how all of its elements interact during times of far-reaching change , whether it be a financial crisis or a growth spurt . 
Yet , the studies of green growth mentioned above all appear to provide such explanations . 
So , what do they really tell us ? 
In practice , each is limited to just one or two aspects of the economy , and describes how these interact . 
Growing Green and Decent Jobs looks at the relationship between investment and jobs . 
A New Growth Path for Europe examines the impact of expectations and learning-by-doing . 
Roadmap 2050 focuses on greening the power system . 
The authors then make a leap of faith to derive conclusions about the economy as a whole . 
But , while the value of these studies is in the light that they shed on the parts , the ensuing headlines invariably are about the whole , articulated in terms of GDP and jobs . 
Each of the studies describes a part of a green economy , but none can capture the whole - not because they are deficient , but because it is simply beyond our capability . 
That said , the fact that one cannot prove conclusively how green growth would work does not mean that we should give up on the idea . 
We know from history that waves of innovation , from the steam engine to the information and communications revolution , have led to dramatic increases in economic growth . 
We cannot prove that a wave of environmental innovation will have a similar effect , but the studies of the parts make such an outcome highly plausible . 
As humans , we are uniquely equipped to make decisions on the basis of ambiguous information - in fact , we do it all the time . 
When we choose a career or a spouse in our private lives , or when a politician seizes an opportunity from a plethora of possibilities , the task at hand is always about making highly consequential decisions based on imperfect information . 
A big pile of green-growth reports demonstrates the plausibility of this path to recovery from an historic economic crisis . 
It is now up to us to realize its potential . 
Green growth offers a realistic alternative to the faltering austerity approach to overcoming the current economic crisis . 
Policymakers should incorporate this thinking into the &quot; beyond austerity &quot; narrative that is taking shape in a growing number of key EU member states .
