Who Loves China ? 
NEW YORK - Tens of thousands of people have been &quot; occupying &quot; the tear-gas-filled streets of Hong Kong &apos;s Central district to fight for their democratic rights . 
Many more may soon join them . 
Though some businessmen and bankers are annoyed by the disruption , the demonstrators are right to protest . 
China &apos;s government has promised Hong Kong &apos;s citizens that they can freely elect their Chief Executive in 2017 . 
Only people who &quot; love China &quot; - that is , love the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) - need apply . 
One can almost understand why China &apos;s leaders should be baffled by this show of defiance in Hong Kong . 
After all , the British simply appointed governors when Hong Kong was still a crown colony , and nobody protested then . 
Indeed , the deal that Hong Kong &apos;s colonial subjects appeared to accept - leaving politics alone in exchange for the opportunity to pursue material prosperity in a safe and orderly environment - is not so different from the deal accepted by China &apos;s educated classes today . 
The common opinion among British colonial civil servants , businessmen , and diplomats was that the Chinese were not really interested in politics anyway ; all they cared about was money . 
But , for a long time , it seemed to be true in Hong Kong . 
Hong Kong was never a democracy , but it did have a relatively free press , a relatively honest government , and an independent judiciary - all backed by a democratic government in London . 
For most Hong Kong citizens , the prospect of being handed over in 1997 from one colonial power to another was never an entirely happy one . 
But what really invigorated politics in Hong Kong was the brutal crackdown in Beijing &apos;s Tiananmen Square and in other Chinese cities in 1989 . 
Huge demonstrations took place in Hong Kong to protest the massacre , and massive commemorations of the event are held every June , keeping alive a memory that is repressed and fading in the rest of China . 
It was not simply humanitarian rage that galvanized so many people in Hong Kong to act in 1989 . 
They recognized then that under future Chinese rule , only genuine democracy might safeguard the institutions that protected Hong Kong &apos;s freedoms . 
Without any significant say in how they were to be governed , Hong Kong &apos;s citizens would be at the mercy of China &apos;s leaders . 
From the point of view of China &apos;s Communist rulers , this seems perverse . 
They regard Hong Kongers &quot; democratic demands as a misguided effort to mimic Western politics , or even as a form of nostalgia for British imperialism . 
Either way , the demonstrators &quot; agenda is considered &quot; anti-Chinese . &quot; 
The way China &apos;s rulers see it , only firm control from the top and the CCP &apos;s unquestioned supremacy can create the conditions needed for a rich and powerful China to emerge . 
Democracy , in their view , leads to disorder ; freedom of thought causes popular &quot; confusion &quot; ; and public criticism of the Party tends toward the breakdown of authority . 
In this sense , the CCP is rather traditional . 
China traditionally had institutions - clan associations , religious communities , business groups , and so on - that were relatively autonomous . 
Imperial rule may have been authoritarian , but there were large pockets of independence from central control . 
In that sense , Hong Kong is perhaps more traditional than the rest of China , excluding , of course , Taiwan . 
Today , the CCP &apos;s political supremacy places it above the law , which encourages corruption among Party officials , whether at the local or national level . 
Strict Party control of religious , academic , artistic , and journalistic expression stifles the dissemination of necessary information and creative thought . 
The lack of an independent judiciary undermines the rule of law . 
None of this benefits future development . 
When Hong Kong was formally handed back to China 17 years ago , some optimists thought that the former colony &apos;s greater freedoms would help to reform the rest of China . 
The example of a clean bureaucracy and independent judges would strengthen the rule of law throughout the country . 
Others , for the same reason , regarded Hong Kong as a dangerous Trojan horse that could seriously undermine the Communist order . 
So far , there is no evidence that the protesters in Hong Kong &apos;s Central district have any ambition to undermine , let alone topple , the government in Beijing . 
They have their hands full just standing up for their own rights in Hong Kong , and the chance that they will succeed appears to be slim . 
Chinese President Xi Jinping is anxious to show how tough he can be . 
Compromise would smack of weakness . 
His aim seems to be to make Hong Kong more like the rest of China , rather than the other way round . 
And yet , there is every reason to believe that China would benefit greatly from the opposite course . 
Less official corruption , more trust in the law , and greater freedom of thought would make China a more stable , more creative , and even more prosperous society . 
In the short term , this probably will not happen .
