Evading Tax Evasion 
ALESSANDRIA , ITALY - Tax evasion is a global scourge . 
The &quot; black &quot; economy has , by some estimates , reached 10 % of GDP in advanced countries and can top 70 % in developing countries . 
And it is getting worse . 
Tax evasion is usually confronted in two ways : audits and harsh sanctions . 
But , as the rising tide of tax evasion suggests , these mechanisms amount only to a cat game of and mouse problem - and the mice , it seems , are winning . 
As tax evasion becomes more pervasive , whole networks to help hide incomes have appeared , making it far less likely that those who break the law are punished . 
Moreover , because more people are evading taxes , tax administrations are under increasing pressure to become more lenient or to accept bribes . 
One strategy for weakening ties among potential evaders is to introduce various conflicts of interests . 
For example , value-added tax is designed to encourage firms to procure invoices for their inputs in order to reduce their own tax outlays . 
But the results often fall short of the potential benefits , because VAT has helped inspire tax evaders to create even stronger networks that can hide an entire chain of transactions . 
The Chinese have devised a novel solution . 
To encourage customers to request official receipts as proof of payment , some local tax authorities issue a type of receipt that doubles as a lottery ticket . 
The receipts can be used as scratch cards to win small amounts of cash , but they also serve as lottery tickets for winning larger amounts . 
To prevent forgery , businesses must purchase special , patented machines for printing these receipts . 
Records of the printed receipts are automatically transmitted to the tax authorities and are used to calculate taxes . 
Similar systems are in use in Taiwan and Latin America . 
Another way to reward consumers for combating tax evasion is to offer subsidies . 
Some developing countries have introduced a far-reaching VAT refund system for consumers who collect official receipts . 
Northern Cyprus , like Turkey , offers a 2.5 percentage point refund on VAT , compared to the standard VAT rate of 13 % . 
But such systems are burdened by large administration and compliance costs . 
The process of collecting and verifying claims is time-consuming , and the net benefit for taxpayers is low . 
Moreover , the method is vulnerable to illicit practices , such as collecting receipts issued to foreigners and students , who cannot claim their own refunds . 
Monetary subsidies to consumption are also often granted in developed countries for a variety of purposes , not least of which is fighting tax evasion . 
One such subsidy is permitting deduction of a fixed percentage of certain expenses from income tax . 
In Italy , expenditures for home improvements have been partly deductible for the past ten years , mainly to improve tax compliance by firms in the housing sector . 
New regulations have recently been introduced with the specific aim of cracking down on moonlighting . 
Under the 2007 financial law , those who claim the home improvement deduction must supply an invoice from the building contractor , which must specify the cost for labor . 
In terms of reducing tax evasion , the results have been mixed . 
The bulk of claims for the subsidy come from northern Italy , which is usually considered less prone to tax evasion to begin with . 
While some cases of illegitimate claims are under investigation , there is no black market for receipts ; fraud seems to arise mainly through falsified invoices . 
While econometric studies are not available , raw data show an increase in reported income and in the number of firms and official workers . 
However , taxable income in the sector is still growing at a slower rate than gross income as measured by national accounts . 
When tax evasion is extremely common , taxpayers are likely to experience high transaction and psychological costs in resorting to tax auditors to enforce the issuing of receipts . 
But if consumers bear the brunt of costs for reporting violations to the authorities , subsidies may induce them to seek out vendors willing to offer legal transactions . 
Yet these efforts are also costly . 
Whenever a firm chooses to evade , it becomes increasingly difficult to find a vendor willing to engage in legal transactions . 
When alternatives become difficult to find , the compensation requested for accepting an illegal transaction falls . 
As typically happens in these cases , once a critical mass of tax evasion is reached , it can jump to much larger values . 
This process might also explain why , although many reward systems have proven successful at the beginning , their benefits quickly fade . 
Of course , there is a risk that subsidies and lotteries may diminish the moral motivation of citizens to obey tax laws , because compliance becomes conditional on some form of compensation . 
But if lotteries , subsidies , and other devices fail to control tax evasion , the Chinese have another method : the death penalty .
