A Reset in the Caucasus 
YEREVAN - Will Turkey &apos;s current turmoil between Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan and the country &apos;s powerful army complicate and delay the country &apos;s boldest initiatives in years - the moves to address decades-old tensions with both Armenians and Kurds ? 
Restructuring the role of Turkey &apos;s army is vital , but if Turkey cannot follow through with the Armenian and Kurdish openings , the country &apos;s own domestic situation , its relations with the two peoples , as well as tensions in the Caucasus , will undoubtedly worsen . 
Of the several flashpoints in the region , including that between Georgia and Russia over South Ossetia and Abkhazia , the tension between Armenians and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh is among the most challenging . 
As to Georgia and Russia , the disproportionate size , weight , and power on one side are enough to deter any return to violence . 
Moreover , there are no entangling alliances complicating the matter . 
Georgia is not a NATO member , and the United States , it is clear , will not go to war with Russia over Georgia . 
The Armenian-Azerbaijani struggle is more precarious . 
It is no longer a two-way tug-of-war between two small post-Soviet republics , but part of an Armenia-Turkey-Azerbaijan triangle . 
This triangle is the direct consequence of the process of normalization between Armenia and Turkey , which began when both countries &quot; presidents met at a football game . 
That process now hinges on protocols for establishing diplomatic relations that have been signed by both governments but unratified by either parliament . 
Completing the process depends directly and indirectly on how Armenians and Azerbaijan work to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict . 
This snarled three-way dispute , if not carefully untangled , holds many dangers . 
Turkey , which for nearly two decades has proclaimed its support for Azerbaijan , publicly conditioned rapprochement with Armenia on Armenian concessions to Azerbaijan . 
Turkey , a NATO member , is thus a party to this conflict now , and any military flare-up between Armenians and Azerbaijanis might draw it in - possibly triggering Russia &apos;s involvement , either through its bilateral commitments to Armenia , or through the Collective Security Treaty Organization , of which Armenia and Russia are members . 
Given energy-security concerns , any Azerbaijani conflict would also seriously affect Europe . 
Iran , too would be affected , since it is a frontline state with interests in the region . 
Armenians and Azerbaijanis have not clashed militarily for more than a decade and a half . 
But this is only because there has been the perception of a military balance and a hope that ongoing negotiations would succeed . 
Today , both factors have changed . 
The perception of military parity has altered . 
With Azerbaijan having spent extravagantly on armaments in recent years it may now have convinced itself that it now holds the upper hand . 
At the same time , there is less hope in negotiations , which appear to be stalled , largely because they have been linked to the Armenia-Turkey process , which also seems to be in limbo . 
The diplomatic protocols awaiting ratification by the two countries &quot; parliaments have fallen victim to miscalculations on both sides . 
The Armenians came to believe that Turkey would find a way to reconcile Azerbaijan &apos;s interests with the Turkish opening to Armenia , and would open the border with Armenia regardless of progress on resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh issue . 
The problem is that Turkey initially closed the border precisely because of Nagorno-Karabakh , rather than any bilateral issue . 
Turkey believed that by signing protocols with Armenia and clearly indicating its readiness to open the border , the Armenians could somehow be cajoled or pressured into resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh problem more quickly or cede territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh . 
But this has always been unlikely in the absence of a comprehensive settlement that addresses Armenians &quot; greatest fear - security - and fulfils their basic political requirement , namely a definition of Nagorno-Karabakh &apos;s status . 
Both sides seem to be somewhat surprised by the other &apos;s expectations . 
Indeed , there is a growing fear that a settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute is more distant now , because Turkey &apos;s public backing has raised Azerbaijan &apos;s expectations , while some Armenians fear collusion between neighbors out to railroad them into an unsustainable agreement . 
This is Turkey &apos;s moment of truth . 
The Armenia-Turkey diplomatic process has stalled , and the Turkish government &apos;s effort at reconciliation with the country &apos;s large Kurdish minority has soured . 
Just as a loss of confidence among Kurds and Turks in eastern Turkey will rock the shaky stability that they have recently enjoyed , a loss of hope for a settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute may end the tentative military calm between Armenians and Azerbaijanis 
But the situation is not irretrievable . 
Endless public sparring between Turkish and Armenian officials through the media is not helping . 
It is time for both countries &quot; leaders to speak privately and directly with each other , with an understanding of the instability that could result from any failure to complete the diplomatic opening that the two sides initiated . 
So , even as Turkey tries to deal with the consequences of its history at home , and redefine the army &apos;s role in society , it must reset its tortured relationship with Armenia . 
The recent resolution passed by the Foreign Relations Committee of the US Congress , which called 
The two sides must step back , look at the situation dispassionately , acknowledge the deficiencies in the protocols , address the other side &apos;s minimum requirements , and bear in mind that a single document will not heal all wounds or wipe out all fears . 
The international community must support this effort . 
The problem should not be dismissed as a mere settling of old scores . 
What is at stake is the future of a region critical to Eurasia &apos;s peace .
