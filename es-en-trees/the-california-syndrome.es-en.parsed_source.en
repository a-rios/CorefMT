The California Syndrome 
STANFORD - California has long been a harbinger of national and global trends ( both wonderful and overindulgent ) , a birthplace of innovation in everything from technology and entertainment to lifestyles . 
The world &apos;s most important technology companies still make their start - and their headquarters - in California : Apple , Intel , Cisco , Oracle , Google , and Facebook , to name a few in the neighborhood where I teach and live . 
California once was a source of widely shared rising standards of living and tremendous upward economic mobility . 
The state had America &apos;s best public schools and state universities . 
Its citizens were less socially and economically stratified than in many other US states . 
After World War II , Americans migrated steadily to California , a land of opportunity , great natural beauty , and some of the world &apos;s most fertile agricultural land . 
But then something went radically wrong , and understanding why offers lessons for national and subnational governments everywhere . 
California &apos;s economy , which used to outperform the rest of the country , now substantially underperforms . 
The unemployment rate , at 12.4 % , is higher than in every other state except Nevada . 
In recent years , net migration has reversed , with hundreds of thousands of workers and their families leaving the state in search of better job opportunities elsewhere . 
California &apos;s public schools , from kindergarten to high school , rank poorly on standardized tests . 
The state is an epicenter of the housing bust and the foreclosure crisis . 
Silicon Valley CEOs say they will not expand in California because of high taxes and burdensome regulation , which make the state uncompetitive . 
With 12 % of America &apos;s population , California accounts for more than 31 % of its public-assistance recipients . 
It has a vast and growing prison population , with annual spending on each incarcerated inmate equivalent to a middle-income California household &apos;s after-tax income . 
Meanwhile , the state lurches from fiscal tragedy to fiscal farce . 
Governor Jerry Brown ( who was also Governor in the 1970 &quot; s ) inherits a budget deficit of $ 26 billion . 
At the heart of California &apos;s problem is its deranged progressive tax system , which includes among the highest personal-income , sales , corporate , and gas rates of any state . 
Only property taxes are below the US average . 
California &apos;s government collects about one-half of its income-tax revenue from the top 1 % of the state &apos;s taxpayers . 
The revenue is all spent on the upswing , forcing disruptive emergency cutbacks on the way down . 
Attempts to build a serious &quot; rainy day fund &quot; have failed badly . 
The political economy of California &apos;s budget has taken the progressive tax-and-spend experiment to the breaking point , threatening the state &apos;s ability to fund basic services , from prisons and parks to education and health care , even those aimed at helping its most vulnerable citizens . 
California &apos;s government rarely manages to satisfy the balanced-budget requirement in the state constitution . 
It winds up borrowing &quot; temporarily &quot; with short-term debt ; then , as borrowing accumulates , it is refinanced with longer-term securities . 
Spending is temporarily reduced and taxes raised , but the long-run structural deficit remains , a pattern now repeated in many state capitals and the primary reason for the current political turmoil over budgets and public sector unions . 
Many other strains are also self-inflicted . 
From federal water shutoffs , in the name of protecting a tiny fish , which have decimated agriculture and left tens of thousands unemployed , to severe local zoning restrictions that drive home prices higher , California now has a wide array of problems begging for solutions . 
Illegal immigrants perform a substantial share of the state economy &apos;s menial and physically demanding work . 
Absent a sensible guest-worker program , they remain in the shadows , and they and their children crowd public services . 
( In one school in Los Angeles , a teacher reported 70 kids who came and went during the year in a class of 25 , and more than a dozen languages are spoken in some school districts ) . 
The state &apos;s extensive environmental and energy regulation , including micromanaging carbon emissions , in combination with globalization , has driven away much of California &apos;s manufacturing and many of its middle-class jobs . 
Among US states , California still ranks first in technology , agriculture , and entertainment . 
It ranks last or near the bottom in business climate , housing affordability , and state bond rating ( below even the US territory of Puerto Rico ) . 
It &apos;s a complex picture , but at its core is a high-tax welfare state run amok . 
No one should write off California ; it still has great strengths . 
A healthy democracy cannot have half the population paying taxes and the other half collecting benefits . 
Relying on ever-higher taxes to fund payments to an outsized population of benefit recipients is a recipe for exporting prosperity elsewhere . 
That is one California trend that others emulate at their peril .
