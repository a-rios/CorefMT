The Cultural Revolution at 40 
Mao &apos;s Cultural Revolution was launched 40 years ago this month , yet , despite 20 years of economic liberalization , its wounds remain a taboo subject . 
Today &apos;s rulers dare not face up to their own experiences or moral responsibility . 
So , three decades after the Cultural Revolution ended , the national self-examination that China requires has not yet begun . 
Of course , the Communist Party has deemed the Cultural Revolution a &quot; catastrophe , &quot; a judgment supported by mainstream opinion . 
But China &apos;s rulers permit discussion of the Cultural Revolution only within this official framework , suppressing any and all unofficial reflections . 
The generalized official verdict , and the use of Lin Piao ( once Mao Zedong &apos;s Vice President and designated heir , who rebelled against him ) and the &quot; Gang of Four &quot; as scapegoats , obscures the crimes of Mao and the Party , as well as the entrenched flaws in the system . 
The Cultural Revolution &apos;s major figures , who wrought so much mindless violence , thus either maintain their silence or offer spurious self-defenses . 
Most victims also use various excuses to bottle up their memories . 
Those who both persecuted and were persecuted are willing to talk only about their being victims . 
For example , the fanatical Red Guard movement swallowed up almost every youth of the right age . 
Yet all but a few old Red Guards remain silent , saying , &quot; it is not worth remembering . &quot; 
During the Cultural Revolution &apos;s early days , the Beijing-based Allied Movement , formed by the children of party cadres , committed horrendous acts of violence , operating under the slogan , &quot; If the father is a hero , the son is a good man ; if the father is a reactionary , the son is a turtle egg . &quot; 
But the memoirs of these rebellious vanguards of yesteryear highlight only their youthful passion and pure idealism , or their sufferings and those of their parents . 
They do not mention their own barbaric assaults , vandalism , and looting , or their kangaroo courts . 
The revolution &apos;s veterans refuse to discuss their arrogant presumption of &quot; natural Redness , &quot; or to mention that they rebelled because they wanted power . 
Worse still , they express no remorse toward their victims . 
The Cultural Revolution swept up all of China . 
So many people suffered that it is difficult to count the number of victims accurately . 
Yet few reflect and apologize . 
The terror of the Red Guards , the armed fights between the rebellious sects , the teams established to &quot; cleanse &quot; the social classes , and all the bloody massacres are simply left to rot in China &apos;s memory . 
The official ban blocks reflection , but human weakness and careerist self-interest among those who participated buttresses the official ban . 
Consider Ye Xiangzhen , the daughter of senior general Ye Jianying , who once discussed her family &apos;s Cultural Revolution experiences on television . 
During the early stages of the Cultural Revolution , she played a dual role : daughter of a Chinese field marshal and leader of the rebels at the School of Art in the capital . 
She complained that she was &quot; too famous , &quot; &quot; too active , &quot; and &quot; too stressed &quot; at the time , and she provided extensive details about how Mao &apos;s wife , Jiang Qing , persecuted the Ye family and how the Ye children went to prison . 
But she had only 58 words to say about her career as a Red Guard leader - no details or explanation of how she joined , which activities she participated in , and whether she was involved in &quot; physical struggles &quot; or persecuted others . 
To call for those people who applied violence and persecuted others to examine themselves and repent is not intended to mete out legal responsibility and moral judgment . 
But it would at least restore the truth about the Cultural Revolution , summarizing its lessons in order to avoid repetition . 
More positively , restoring truth would counter the traditional Chinese instinct to blame all disasters on external forces , and might lead to a spiritual epiphany for a people struggling to find value in the emerging new China . 
The person with the most responsibility for the catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution is , of course , Mao , yet he remains China &apos;s savior . 
The children of Mao &apos;s senior cadres who enjoyed the greatest fame during the Cultural Revolution are now the principal beneficiaries of today &apos;s economic reforms . 
But this continuing silence by the guilty only transfers the costs to society as a whole , with Chinese life distorted by the weight of lies and evasions . 
As one generation after another continues to live in denial , the lies will corrode everything they touch . 
The Chinese people will no longer know what is personal honesty or historical truth , and they will repeatedly abuse , miss , or forsake historic opportunities . 
As long as the Cultural Revolution remains unaccounted for , it will not have ended . 
If historical truth is not restored , the lessons cannot be learned . 
No amount of material prosperity can make China a healthy society without this necessary reckoning with the past .
