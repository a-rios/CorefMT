The Rocky Road to Recovery 
NEW YORK - A consensus now exists that America &apos;s recession - already a year old - is likely to be long and deep , and that almost all countries will be affected . 
I always thought that the notion that what happened in America would be decoupled from the rest of the world was a myth . 
Events are showing that to be so . 
Fortunately , America has , at last , a president with some understanding of the nature and severity of the problem , and who has committed himself to a strong stimulus program . 
This , together with concerted action by governments elsewhere , will mean that the downturn will be less severe than it otherwise would be . 
The United States Federal Reserve , which helped create the problems through a combination of excessive liquidity and lax regulation , is trying to make amends - by flooding the economy with liquidity , a move that , at best , has merely prevented matters from being worse . 
It &apos;s not surprising that those who helped create the problems and didn &apos;t see the disaster coming have not done a masterly job in dealing with it . 
By now , the dynamics of the downturn are set , and things will get worse before they get better . 
In some ways , the Fed resembles a drunk driver who , suddenly realizing that he is heading off the road starts careening from side to side . 
The response to the lack of liquidity is ever more liquidity . 
When the economy starts recovering , and banks start lending , will they be able to drain the liquidity smoothly out of the system ? 
Will America face a bout of inflation ? 
Or , more likely , in another moment of excess , will the Fed over-react , nipping the recovery in the bud ? 
Given the unsteady hand exhibited so far , we cannot have much confidence in what awaits us . 
Still , I am not sure that there is sufficient appreciation of some of the underlying problems facing the global economy , without which the current global recession is unlikely to give way to robust growth - no matter how good a job the Fed does . 
For a long time , the US has played an important role in keeping the global economy going . 
America &apos;s profligacy - the fact that the world &apos;s richest country could not live within its means - was often criticized . 
But perhaps the world should be thankful , because without American profligacy , there would have been insufficient global aggregate demand . 
In the past , developing countries filled this role , running trade and fiscal deficits . 
But they paid a high price , and fiscal responsibility and conservative monetary policies are now the fashion . 
Indeed , many developing countries , fearful of losing their economic sovereignty to the IMF - as occurred during the 1997 Asian financial crisis - accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves . 
Money put into reserves is income not spent . 
Moreover , growing inequality in most countries of the world has meant that money has gone from those who would spend it to those who are so well off that , try as they might , they can &apos;t spend it all . 
The world &apos;s unending appetite for oil , beyond its ability or willingness to produce , has contributed a third factor . 
Rising oil prices transferred money to oil-rich countries , again contributing to the flood of liquidity . 
Though oil prices have been dampened for now , a robust recovery could send them soaring again . 
For a while , people spoke almost approvingly of the flood of liquidity . 
But this was just the flip side of what Keynes had worried about - insufficient global aggregate demand . 
The search for return contributed to the reckless leverage and risk taking that underlay this crisis . 
America &apos;s government will , for a time , partly make up for the increasing savings of US consumers . 
But if America &apos;s consumers go from their near zero savings to a modest 4 % or 5 % of GDP , then the depressing effect on demand ( in addition to that resulting from declines in investment , exports , and state and local government expenditures ) will not be fully offset by even the largest government expenditure programs . 
In two years , governments , mindful of the huge increases in the debt burden resulting from the mega-bailouts and the mind-boggling deficits , will be under pressure to run primary surpluses ( where government spending net of interest payments is less than revenues . ) 
A few years ago , there was worry about the risk of a disorderly unwinding of &quot; global imbalances . &quot; 
The current crisis can be viewed as part of that , but little is being done about the underlying problems that gave rise to these imbalances . 
We need not just temporary stimuli , but longer-term solutions . 
It is not as if there was a shortage of needs ; it is only that those who might meet those needs have a shortage of funds . 
First , we need to reverse the worrying trends of growing inequality . 
More progressive income taxation will also help stabilize the economy , through what economists call &quot; automatic stabilizers . &quot; 
It would also help if the advanced developed countries fulfilled their commitments to helping the world &apos;s poorest by increasing their foreign-aid budgets to 0.7 % of GDP . 
Second , the world needs enormous investments if it is to respond to the challenges of global warming . 
Transportation systems and living patterns must be changed dramatically . 
Third , a global reserve system is needed . 
It makes little sense for the world &apos;s poorest countries to lend money to the richest at low interest rates . 
The system is unstable . 
The dollar reserve system is fraying , but is likely to be replaced with a dollar / euro or dollar / euro / yen system that is even more unstable . 
Annual emissions of a global reserve currency ( what Keynes called Bancor , or the IMF calls SDRs ) could help fuel global aggregate demand , and be used to promote development and address the problems of global warming . 
This year will be bleak . 
The question we need to be asking now is , how can we enhance the likelihood that we will eventually emerge into a robust recovery ?
