China &apos;s Slow-Growth Opportunity 
BEIJING - After four disappointing years , Chinese economists have realized that slowing GDP growth - from a post-crisis peak of 12.8 % in 2010 to about 7 % today - is mainly structural , rather than cyclical . 
In other words , China &apos;s potential growth rate has settled onto a significantly lower plateau . 
While the country should be able to avoid a hard landing , it can expect annual growth to remain at 6-7 % over the next decade . 
But this may not necessarily be bad news . 
One might question why GDP in China , where per capita income recently surpassed $ 7,000 , is set to grow so much more slowly than Japan &apos;s did from 1956 to 1970 , when the Japanese economy , with per capita income starting from about $ 7,000 , averaged 9.7 % annual growth . 
The answer lies in potential growth . 
Whereas , according to Japan &apos;s central bank , Japanese labor productivity grew by more than 10 % annually , on average , from 1960 to 1973 , Chinese productivity has been declining steadily in recent years , from 11.8 % in 2001-2008 to 8.8 % in 2008-2012 , and to 7.4 % in 2011-2012 . 
Japan &apos;s labor supply ( measured in labor hours ) was also growing during that period , by more than 3 % annually . 
By contrast , China &apos;s working-age population has been shrinking , by more than three million annually , since 2012 - a trend that will , with a 4-6-year lag , cause labor-supply growth to decline , and even turn negative . 
Given the difficulty of reversing these trends , it is difficult to imagine how China could maintain a growth rate anywhere close to 10 % for another decade , despite its low per capita income . 
But there is more . 
As the Japanese economist Ryuichiro Tachi has pointed out , Japan also benefited from a high savings rate and a low capital coefficient ( the ratio of capital to output ) of less than 1 . 
Though a precise comparison is difficult , there is no doubt that China &apos;s capital coefficient is much higher , implying a larger gap between the growth rate of capital intensity ( the total amount of capital needed per dollar of revenue ) and that of labor productivity . 
At times , a high investment rate can offset a high capital coefficient &apos;s negative impact on growth . 
But China &apos;s investment rate is already too high , accounting for almost half of GDP . 
With capital intensity increasing significantly faster than labor productivity in China , the inefficiency of investment is clear . 
In this context , increased investment would only exacerbate the problem . 
Making matters worse , China &apos;s corporate debt is already the highest in the world , both in absolute terms and relative to GDP . 
In this context , increasing investment would not only reduce capital efficiency further ; it would also heighten the risk implied by companies &quot; high leverage ratios . 
With all major indicators suggesting a significant decline in China &apos;s growth potential , China &apos;s leaders must accept the reality of lower growth and adjust their priorities accordingly . 
Succumbing to the temptation of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus , such as that pursued in the wake of the global economic crisis , would not only fail to boost growth in a sustainable way ; it would actually undermine growth and stability in the medium to long term . 
A better approach would focus on making economic growth more sustainable . 
On this issue , Japan has some useful lessons to offer . 
In the 1970s , recognizing the inevitability of a slowdown , Japan shelved its ambitious plan to &quot; remodel &quot; the Japanese archipelago . 
Policymakers shut down energy-intensive factories in the heavy chemical industry , promoted innovation , and took steps to address air and water pollution . 
As a result , the quality of Japan &apos;s economic growth improved considerably , even as its rate fell by nearly half in the decade after the oil shock in 1973 . 
The good news is that China &apos;s leaders seem intent on adopting a similar approach , including avoidance of monetary and fiscal expansion , unless growth seems set to collapse . 
Indeed , at the recently concluded National People &apos;s Congress , Prime Minister Li Keqiang affirmed the authorities &quot; 7 % target for GDP growth this year , while reiterating the importance of deepening reform and carrying out structural adjustments . 
For China , accepting lower growth provides a crucial opportunity to support stable and sustainable development . 
If China &apos;s leaders stay the course of reform and rebalancing , the entire global economy will be better off .
