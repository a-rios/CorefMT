From Moscow to Sochi 
NEW YORK - The Winter Olympics in Sochi are the first to be hosted by Russia since the Cold War-era Moscow Summer Games in 1980 . 
Obviously , much has changed politically in the interim . 
Many people who remember the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and its tumultuous aftermath believe that Russia &apos;s economy today must be impoverished and unstable - and far behind booming China . 
Wrong . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , Russia &apos;s per capita income in 2013 , measured in terms of purchasing power parity , is roughly $ 18,600 , nearly double China &apos;s per capita income of around $ 10,000 . 
Yes , Russia &apos;s economy has been buoyed recently not only by sound macroeconomic policies , but also by high world oil and gas prices . 
In fact , the collapse of world oil prices after 1985 contributed to the severe economic crisis in the Soviet Union and Russia in the late 1980 &quot; s and early 1990 &quot; s . 
This is an important point , given that the economic reforms implemented by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and former Russian President Boris Yeltsin thus confronted powerful headwinds . 
For two years ( 1992-1993 ) , I was a macroeconomic adviser to Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov , trying to help Russia to end the high inflation and extreme shortages that characterized the last years of the Soviet era , and to begin Russia &apos;s transition to a market economy . 
I recommended a macroeconomic stabilization strategy that had been highly successful in nearby Poland , and that called for timely financial assistance from the United States , Europe , and the IMF , just as Poland had received . 
Unfortunately , the West did not provide the needed financial assistance , contrary to my ( and many other people &apos;s ) recommendations , and the Russian economic and financial calamity was more severe as a result . 
At the time , I attributed Western inaction to incompetence on the part of the US government and the IMF . 
Looking back , it is clear that there was also a deliberate strategy by US neoconservatives , such as then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney , to weaken the new Russian state . 
The US government was also complicit during the mid-1990 &quot; s in the plundering of Russian state-owned property , including oil assets that were unscrupulously privatized . 
The good news is that Russia was able to bounce back from those terrible years , no thanks to the West or the US government . 
After several years of political infighting and unnecessary delay , macroeconomic stabilization was achieved , and Russia &apos;s economic growth was restored , especially as world oil and gas prices began to rise . 
From 2001 to 2013 , Russia &apos;s GDP grew at a robust 4.4 % average annual rate . 
Russia achieved a good measure of financial stability as well . 
The IMF puts Russia &apos;s inflation rate at 6.9 % in 2013 , with unemployment at 5.5 % , while the budget deficit was just 0.3 % of GDP . 
Moreover , Russia &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves stand at a healthy $ 500 billion . 
But Russia could achieve still greater success by basing its economy on two growth engines rather than one . 
Oil and gas will continue to provide a strong lift to Russia for years to come , especially as China becomes a major customer . 
Yet Russia also has vast and still under-developed potential in many global high-tech industries . 
During the Soviet era , Russia produced a vast array of technology-based industrial products , from airplanes to computers to sophisticated machine goods . 
Unlike Chinese industry , Russia &apos;s manufacturing branches were almost completely cut off from world markets , both by the Cold War and by Soviet planning . 
When post-Soviet Russia opened itself to trade , its industrial enterprises lagged far behind cutting-edge technologies , especially in the dynamic information and communications technology ( ICT ) sector . 
Many industries collapsed , owing to neglect , lack of international partners , and financial chaos . 
Those that survived did so only barely , with greatly reduced output going mainly to the ex-Soviet market . 
Russia has the know-how , skilled engineering , and natural-resource base to become a global competitor in a range of major high-tech industries , including nuclear energy , commercial aviation , commercial space technology ( including satellites and GPS ) , ICT hardware and software , electric vehicles , high-speed rail , petrochemicals , and heavy equipment for the mining and hydrocarbon sectors . 
All of these industries will benefit from the potential for enormous demand growth in large markets , such as China , Africa , and India . 
But achieving long-term growth led by high-tech industries requires a business environment that encourages private-sector investment , including openness to foreign players . 
Moreover , the social and political environment must be conducive to a high-tech labor force , providing an attractive quality of life , ensuring civil liberties , and supporting entrepreneurship and creativity . 
Finally , economic policies must promote technological advances and global technical cooperation in promising sectors . 
It is notable that Russia recently completed an agreement to finance a nuclear power plant in Hungary , and looks likely to do the same in Turkey . 
The demand for nuclear energy will grow as part of the global effort to decarbonize the world energy system . 
Russia &apos;s new reactors seem to be safe and competitive with those produced elsewhere . 
Similarly , we might see new Russian-built civilian aircraft entering the global market in partnership with international firms , especially those that can work with Russian companies on advanced ICT avionics . 
Back in 1991 , many thought that Russia could not end high inflation , adopt a market economy , or compete effectively in world markets . 
Two decades later , Russia has proved the skeptics wrong . 
Yes , Russia remains too dependent on oil and gas , and should move further on transparency , openness , and competition in business and governance . 
Yet the trend is positive : Russia has become a stable , high-income market economy , with strong prospects for decades of rapid GDP growth and high-tech progress if it pursues a sensible economic strategy in the coming years .
