Faith in a Globalized Age 
LONDON - For years , it was assumed , certainly in the West , that , as society developed , religion would wither away . 
But it hasn &apos;t , and , at the start of a new decade , it is time for policymakers to take religion seriously . 
The number of people proclaiming their faith worldwide is growing . 
This is clearly so in the Islamic world . 
Whereas Europe &apos;s birthrate is stagnant , the Arab population is set to double in the coming decades , and the population will rise in many Asian Muslim-majority countries . 
Christianity is also growing - in odd ways and in surprising places . 
Religion &apos;s largest growth is in China . 
Indeed , the religiosity of China is worth reflecting on . 
There are more Muslims in China than in Europe , more practicing Protestants than in England , and more practicing Catholics than in Italy . 
In addition , according to the latest surveys , around 100 million Chinese identify themselves as Buddhist . 
And , of course , Confucianism - a philosophy rather than a religion - is deeply revered . 
There is a huge Evangelical movement in Brazil and Mexico . 
Faith remains for many in the United States a vital part of their lives . 
Even in Europe , the numbers confessing to a belief in God remain high . 
And , of course there are hundreds of millions of Hindus and still solid numbers of Sikhs and Jews . 
Those of faith do great work because of it . 
Around 40 % of health care in Africa is delivered by faith-based organizations . 
Muslim , Hindu , and Jewish relief groups are active the world over in combating poverty and disease . 
In any developed nation , you will find selfless care being provided to the disabled , the dying , the destitute , and the disadvantaged , by people acting under the impulse of their faith . 
Common to all great religions is love of neighbors and human equality before God . 
Unfortunately , compassion is not the only context in which religion motivates people . 
It can also promote extremism , even terrorism . 
This is where faith becomes a badge of identity in opposition to those who do not share it , a kind of spiritual nationalism that regards those who do not agree - even those within a faith who live a different view of it - as unbelievers , infidels , and thus enemies . 
To a degree , this has always been so . 
What has changed is the pressure of globalization , which is pushing the world &apos;s peoples ever closer together as technology advances and shrinks the world . 
Growing up 50 years ago , children might rarely meet someone of a different cultural or faith background . 
Today , when I stand in my ten-year-old son &apos;s playground or look at his friends at his birthday party , I find myriad different languages , faiths , and colors . 
Personally , I rejoice in this . 
But such a world requires that mutual respect replace mutual suspicion . 
Such a world upends traditions and challenges old thinking , forcing us to choose consciously to embrace it . 
Or not . 
And there is the rub : for some , this force is a threat . 
It menaces deeply conservative societies . 
And , for those for whom religion matters , globalization can sometimes be accompanied by an aggressive secularism or hedonism that makes many uneasy . 
So we must make sense of how the world of faith interacts with the compulsive process of globalization . 
Yet it is extraordinary how little political time or energy we devote to doing so . 
Most of the conflicts in today &apos;s world have a religious dimension . 
Extremism based on a perversion of Islam shows no sign of abating ; indeed , it will not abate until it is taken on religiously , as well as by security measures . 
This extremism is , slowly but surely , producing its own reaction , as we see from Islamaphobic parties &quot; electoral gains in Europe , and statements by European leaders that multiculturalism has failed . 
Of course , throughout time , religion has often been part of a political conflict . 
But that doesn &apos;t mean that religion should be discounted . 
On the contrary , it requires a special focus . 
I see this very plainly spending so much time in Jerusalem , where - East and West - there is an emphatic increase in religiosity . 
I started my Faith Foundation precisely to create greater understanding between the faiths . 
My reasoning is simple . 
Those advocating extremism in the name of religion are active , well resourced , and - whatever the reactionary nature of their thinking - brilliant at using modern communication and technology . 
We estimate that literally billions of dollars every year are devoted to promoting this view of religion . 
So my Foundation has a university program - now underway in nine countries - that is designed to take religion out of the sole preserve of divinity schools and start analyzing its role in the world today . 
We have another program - in 15 countries , with others set to join - that links high school students across the world through interactive technology to discuss their faith and what it means to them . 
And we have an action program through which young people work with those of another faith to raise awareness of the Millennium Development Goals , the United Nations-led program to combat world poverty . 
We are just one organization . 
There are others starting . 
But governments should start to take this far more seriously . 
The Alliance of Civilizations , begun by Spain and Turkey , is one example . 
The King of Saudi Arabia has also shown great leadership in this sphere . 
Yet this is not just about bringing high-level people together . 
It has to be taken down into the grassroots of nations , especially into the media of their young people . 
Finally , religious leaders must accept a new responsibility : to stand up firmly and resolutely for respecting those of faiths different from their own . 
Aggressive secularists and extremists feed off each other . 
Together , they do constitute a real challenge to people of faith . 
We must demonstrate the loving nature of true faith ; otherwise , religion will be defined by a battle in which extremists seize control of faith communities and secularists claim that such attitudes are intrinsic to religion . 
This would be a tragedy . 
For , above all , it is in this era of globalization that faith can represent reason and progress . 
Religion isn &apos;t dying ; nor should it . 
The world needs faith .
