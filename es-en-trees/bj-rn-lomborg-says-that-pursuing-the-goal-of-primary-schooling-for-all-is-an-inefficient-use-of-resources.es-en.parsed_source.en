The Trouble with Universal Education 
COPENHAGEN - With the deadline for the United Nations Millennium Development Goals fast approaching , the world is gearing up to establish a new set of goals for the next 15 years . 
Given limited resources , policymakers and international organizations must ask themselves : Where can we do the most good ? 
With these questions in mind , the Copenhagen Consensus ( which I direct ) asked some of the world &apos;s top economists to assess the economic , social , and environmental costs and benefits of many different targets . 
Education for all was among the goals that were assessed . 
The importance of education is indisputable . 
The problem is that the international community &apos;s credibility in promising universal education has been compromised ; it has pledged to achieve this goal in at least 12 UN-sponsored declarations since 1950 . 
For example , UNESCO promised in 1961 that , by 1980 , primary education in Africa would be &quot; universal , compulsory , and free . &quot; 
Yet , when the time came , about half of primary-school-aged children in Africa were still not attending school . 
When target dates pass , the goals are simply reformulated on a new timeline , and more money is thrown at the problem , with little consideration of how , exactly , it should be spent . 
And , in fact , the goal of ensuring primary and secondary education for all could well end up costing more than the entire global aid budget for education . 
With 60 million children still out of school , the international community should not simply postpone the same universal-education target until 2030 . 
Instead , it is time to abandon this unrealistic goal in favor of an achievable , targeted , and cost-effective approach . 
As the economist George Psacharopoulos recommended in a recent paper , the highest priority should be what works best : early education , especially preschool . 
The most obvious reasons why earlier education makes for a better starting point is that people are most receptive to knowledge when they are young . 
Moreover , at younger ages , there are fewer cultural barriers to education for girls , and there is less pressure for children to contribute labor . 
Finally , preschool education is less expensive to deliver than higher-level schooling . 
The longer-term effects of early learning are less apparent but more profound . 
Though students who attended preschool do not perform better than their peers in primary school , they do tend to earn more as adults . 
This suggests that preschool provides a qualitative boost to children &apos;s social skills or emotional development that enables them to take better advantage of economic opportunity later in life . 
Of course , the precise return on investment in expanded preschool education is difficult to discern . 
But , in order to prioritize development targets - within and outside of the realm of education - estimates must be made . 
First , there is the straightforward work of adding up the costs of education , such as teacher training and compensation , school construction and maintenance , and even the opportunity cost of child labor . 
Then there is the more ambiguous process of assessing the benefits , which , though difficult to quantify , are convincing enough that many economists champion early education . 
Based on the most extensive data available , Psacharopoulos determined that the most effective target would be to halve the proportion of children who are not attending preschool in Sub-Saharan Africa , which would yield social and economic benefits of $ 33 per dollar spent . 
This goal , which focuses on a single challenge-plagued region , may seem modest ; but it is also realistic and achievable - and the potential returns are massive . 
As targets become more ambitious , they lose their impact . 
For example , the pursuit of universal primary education in Sub-Saharan Africa would yield a lower , but still significant , $ 7 of social and economic benefit for every dollar spent . 
And efforts to achieve universal primary education worldwide would cost far more , with each dollar spent bringing just $ 4 worth of benefits . 
The same type of comparison must be made for other important goals , such as improving the quality of education - a surprisingly difficult objective to achieve , as many developed countries have learned from their poor performance in the OECD &apos;s international assessment . 
While money allocated to , say , reducing class sizes has very little impact , investment in institutional changes - such as the introduction of monitoring and evaluation systems , centrally administered examinations , and incentives for teachers - could result in $ 3-5 of good per dollar spent . 
As for vocational training , the jury is still out . 
But it has been identified as less profitable than general secondary education , making it an inferior investment option . 
Efforts to make university affordable for all are even more problematic . 
Given that children from wealthier households are more likely to pursue higher education , directing limited public resources , including tax revenues , toward reducing its cost amounts to a subsidy for the wealthy , at the expense of the poor . 
A better approach would be to introduce tuition fees for the wealthy and scholarships for the poor . 
Maximizing the impact of scarce resources on the lives of the world &apos;s poorest people demands tough choices . 
In an ideal world , universal , high-quality education at all levels would be worth pursuing . 
But , amid competing demands for basic necessities like health care and potable water , narrower , more cost-effective education targets are essential . 
Instead of aiming to improve billions of people &apos;s circumstances slightly - at high cost - with the same promises that have been made since 1950 , the international community should aim first to transform the lives of millions of children in Sub-Saharan Africa . 
This approach , if applied to all of the goals included in the international community &apos;s next development agenda , would ensure that the world of 2030 is a much better place .
