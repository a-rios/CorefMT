The Kouchner Conversion 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s appointment of Bernard Kouchner as France &apos;s foreign minister was a brilliant political stroke . 
Having beaten his Socialist rival , Ségolène Royal , Sarkozy decided to compound the Socialists &quot; crisis by appointing to his government several political figures long associated with the center-left . 
Sarkozy persuaded two women from immigrant backgrounds , Rama Yade and the well-known feminist activist Fadela Amara , to accept sub-cabinet positions , while Kouchner has been the most popular political figure in France for the past several years . 
Kouchner &apos;s popularity is a curious phenomenon . 
Although he has been in politics for decades , he has not held a government post since serving as deputy health minister under former Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin . 
Yet , whether through the force of his intellect and talent , as he and his supporters say , or his genius at self-promotion , as many of his detractors contend , Kouchner succeeded in remaining at center stage no matter who was France &apos;s president or prime minister . 
But the hour was growing late . 
Kouchner , the co-founder of the relief group Doctors Without Borders , who later split with the organization to found a second humanitarian organization , Doctors of the World , and who ran Kosovo as a United Nations protectorate after NATO &apos;s war with Serbia in 1999 , is now 67 . 
Realistically , Sarkozy &apos;s invitation was probably his last chance to play a major political and international role . 
But what kind of role ? 
Kouchner did not invent the so-called &quot; droit d &apos;ingerence , &quot; which can be rendered in English as the right of intervention . 
That title belongs to the Italian legal theorist Mario Bettati . 
But he is best known as its champion . 
Since the 1970 &quot; s , Kouchner has argued that states have a duty to prevent dictatorial governments from committing the worst abuses against their people . 
While not denying that state sovereignty was the basis of the international system , Kouchner insisted that it could not be a license for governments to kill . 
His words were eloquent and resonated with people of conscience throughout Europe . 
Arguably , the &quot; droit d &apos;ingerence &quot; served as the inspiration for much of the so-called &quot; humanitarian intervention &quot; in the Balkans and in Africa in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Kouchner &apos;s stance also set the stage for the United Nations &quot; adoption of the still more interventionist doctrine of the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; - a call for outside military force to prevent genocide or widespread human rights abuses - during the secretary-generalship of Kofi Annan . 
Kouchner was consistent throughout his career . 
His vision of humanitarian action was one in which relief was not only an end in itself - the traditional Red Cross view that humanitarians palliate the worst effects of war and natural disaster - but also a means for righting wrongs . 
That difference is fundamental . 
Where the Red Cross view , adopted by Kouchner &apos;s former colleagues at Doctors Without Borders , insists that humanitarian action is a vital but limited activity that can be coherent and effective only if it understands its limitations , the Kouchner view is that humanitarian action can be a lever for changing the world . 
Anything less is a dereliction of moral duty . 
In practical terms , whereas the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders believe in neutrality and remain skeptical of the motives of outside states that might intervene , Kouchner &apos;s view is that humanitarian action should be understood as part of what the Canadian writer-politician Michael Ignatieff calls a &quot; revolution of concern . &quot; 
Grave human rights abuses , ethnic cleansing , and genocide would no longer be permitted . 
When they occur , states would stand ready to intervene to put an end to them , peacefully if possible , by force if necessary . 
The often unstated corollary to this doctrine is regime change . 
That was what activists like Kouchner called for , whether or not they admitted it even to themselves , in Rwanda and Kosovo . 
It probably explains why Kouchner was one of the few important French political figures to support the Anglo-American overthrow of Saddam Hussein ( something Sarkozy did not do ) . 
After the debacle in Iraq , what is surprising is that a man who has regime change inscribed in his DNA could occupy so central a position in the French government . 
Perhaps fewer lessons have been learned from Iraq than might have been hoped . 
In fairness to Sarkozy , his motives in appointing Kouchner had more to do with wrong-footing his Socialist adversaries than with the &quot; droit d &apos;ingerence . &quot; 
And Kouchner himself , to the cynical amusement of the French press , has retreated radically from his insistence on an immediate intervention to protect refugees and internally displaced people in Darfur from further slaughter by the Sudanese government-backed Janjawid militia . 
That was the activist Kouchner . 
Foreign Minister Kouchner calls international conferences , speaks of establishing contact groups , and of the need for deliberate action . 
There should be no surprise in any of this . 
Despite some of the more fevered declarations made by Kouchner and other human rights activists , states do not tend to behave altruistically , and electorates do not tend to wish to see their sons and daughters kill and die in altruistic wars . 
Indeed , Kouchner &apos;s appointment is likely to demonstrate just how vain a hope humanitarian intervention always was . 
This may not be a bad thing . 
Kouchner always wanted to be a minister . 
Perhaps now , humanitarian relief groups can get back to doing their vital but not world-transforming work .
