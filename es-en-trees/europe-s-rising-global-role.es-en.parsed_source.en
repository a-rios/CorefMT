Europe &apos;s Rising Global Role 
BRUSSELS - Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War , the contours of world order remain in the making . 
But two &quot; mega-trends &quot; seem clear : the broadest and deepest wave of globalization the world has ever seen , and the rise of new world players from Asia and elsewhere . 
We also hear ever-louder calls for more effective global coordination in meeting the great challenges of our times . 
As the Lisbon Treaty comes into force , the European Union is , I believe , uniquely suited to take on its leadership responsibilities . 
Asia and Europe have been well served by economic globalization . 
Asia &apos;s dynamic economies supply the world , and its remarkable economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty and created major new opportunities for investment and prosperity . 
This has helped great nations such as China and India to assert themselves self-confidently as global powers . 
Europe has capitalized on globalization to consolidate its position as the world &apos;s major economy and trader . 
But globalization also increases competition and exposes weaknesses . 
Workers globally fear for their jobs and feel by-passed by economic change . 
The economic crisis has exacerbated the perceived downside of globalization . 
As a result , our economic interdependence requires careful coordination , not just in the coming weeks , but , crucially , in the longer term . 
We need to revisit the structures of global governance , to ensure that they work better for people everywhere , and in the interests of both current and future generations . 
The EU has led the discussion within its own structures and taken it to wider international fora . 
We welcome the emerging economies &quot; call for reform of global institutions . 
Trade is a case in point . 
It is in the enlightened self-interest of us all not to give in to the temptations of protectionism . 
The economic crisis has made progress in the negotiations of the Doha Development Agenda in the World Trade Organization even more important . 
The WTO framework , to which the EU has always given priority , is increasingly recognized as being fundamental to our prosperity . 
It helps to anchor the global economy in an open , rules-based system based on international law . 
It is good to see the more proactive attitude of our Asian partners toward taking this process forward , but more needs to be done . 
Security is another challenge , with the world facing traditional and non-traditional threats . 
Many of our countries are targets of terrorism , which , eight years on from the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , we must recognize is down , but by no means out . 
There are fragile states to contend with , as well as the dangers of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , authoritarian regimes , and the threat of extremism . 
Globalization has also thrown up non-traditional security challenges that do not respect national frontiers . 
Global pandemics can spread faster ; a lack of secure and sustainable energy could push us into a worldwide recession ; and climate change , beyond its environmental consequences , could have serious geopolitical and social repercussions . 
Multilateral engagement is essential for dealing with these threats . 
The EU has multilateralism in its DNA . 
Others , too , can benefit from its experience . 
Europeans are long-standing champions of the United Nations and international cooperation , and continually seek to ensure that stability , freedom , democracy , and justice prevail as cornerstones of international relations . 
The EU is also doing its share of the heavy lifting . 
It has nearly 100,000 peacekeepers , police , and combat troops on the ground in the world &apos;s hot spots , helping to consolidate peace . 
At the political level , too , the EU is increasingly shouldering its share of the burden . 
An example was the EU mission to Moscow and Tbilisi by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and me . 
This allowed us to make concrete progress on implementation of the EU &apos;s six-point ceasefire plan between Russia and Georgia . 
Reaching agreement on climate change is an immediate priority for all of us . 
We can only tackle this if we work together . 
We all stand to suffer significantly from the effects of climate change , including increased droughts , floods , and other extreme weather conditions . 
The EU is facing up to its responsibilities as a major source of past emissions . 
It has set itself ambitious targets for the future and is taking the lead in seeking a comprehensive global agreement , including a very significant effort on funding . 
Climate change also represents a case study of how we can make a virtue out of a necessity , and an opportunity out of a threat . 
The development and use of green technologies can be new sources of growth . 
Building a sustainable European economy will help to ensure our peoples &quot; prosperity . 
It also shows how Europe can meet its objectives at home only with a proactive and global approach . 
It is this approach that underpins our external policy . 
We cannot meet the challenges faced by the EU effectively and successfully without a strong Europe in the world . 
Prosperity and growth , security and stability , and the long-term sustainability of our societies require the promotion of our interests and values abroad , and engagement with external threats and global challenges . 
The EU &apos;s commitment to the multilateral system of global governance through the UN and other bodies is clear . 
We already speak with conviction and clarity on the major challenges that face us . 
The Lisbon Treaty allows us to achieve a greater coherence and gives us a much greater capacity to act . 
It will allow diplomacy , crisis management and an emerging European defense capability to be used hand in hand with more traditional policies , such as trade and development . 
It is often said that the EU &apos;s comparative advantage lies in its normative power , or the power of its values . 
I think this is right . 
In a post-crisis world , when people are looking for new ways to ensure their well-being , peace , and prosperity , the European experience has a great deal to offer .
