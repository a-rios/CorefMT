Brittle Britain 
LONDON - Which European country faces the greatest risk of political instability and financial turmoil in the year ahead ? 
With less than a week to go before the British general election on May 7 , the answer is both obvious and surprising . 
Once a haven of political and economic stability amid the turmoil of the euro crisis , the United Kingdom is about to become the European Union &apos;s most politically unpredictable member . 
Indeed , continuity is the one election outcome that can almost certainly be excluded . 
Unless opinion polls are inaccurate to a degree unprecedented in British history , the two parties comprising the government coalition , Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats , have almost no chance of winning a combined parliamentary majority . 
One possibility - with a probability slightly above 50 % according to the polls - is that Britain , the birthplace of Thatcherism and the EU &apos;s standard-bearer of neoliberal economics , will soon have a Labour-led government committed to the biggest tax-raising program since the 1970s . 
Moreover , because of the peculiarities of the British electoral system and the rise of Scottish and Welsh nationalism , a Labour government &apos;s survival would depend on the support of parties with even more radical economic agendas and dedicated to dismantling the UK . 
Another scenario - almost as probable as a Labour-led coalition - is a weak and unstable Conservative government . 
To judge by the opinion polls , Cameron &apos;s best hope is to win more parliamentary seats than Labour and try to form a minority government , which could survive as long as the other parties failed to unite against it . 
This might be possible , because the Liberal Democrats and Scottish Nationalist Party may see benefits in allowing a weak Conservative government to remain in power , at least for a while . 
But a minority Conservative government would create additional uncertainties and risks . 
Cameron would be more vulnerable than any leader in postwar British history to blackmail by his own party &apos;s dissidents and extremists , who see it as their historic mission to pull Britain out of the EU . 
Moreover , Britain &apos;s political institutions might be unable to cope . 
The UK &apos;s unwritten constitution is based entirely on tradition and precedent . 
That arrangement has always presupposed strong governments with clear mandates . 
The constitution is so poorly adapted to coalitions and minority governments that some legal scholars question whether the Queen should address Parliament on behalf of &quot; her &quot; new government if there is a risk that it will be toppled within a few weeks or months . 
And yet , although the electoral arithmetic makes a stable centrist government - one that could maintain Britain &apos;s current policies on taxes , economic management , and Europe - almost impossible to imagine , continuity is the outcome that most international business leaders and politicians seem to expect . 
The clearest evidence of this can be seen in financial markets . 
Although the pound has declined by about 10 % from its peak of $ 1.70 last September , sterling weakness has simply reflected the dollar &apos;s strength . 
In the same period , sterling has risen almost 10 % against the euro , while British share prices have hit all-time highs and government bonds have generated better returns in Britain than in the United States , Germany , or Japan . 
What accounts for this apparent indifference - also evident among European politicians - to the looming political risks in Britain ? 
Many international observers believe that politics simply no longer matters much in Britain , because the economy is fundamentally sound and growing at a fairly healthy pace . 
Yes , Britain recorded the fastest economic growth among the major OECD countries in 2014 and has an unemployment rate of only half the EU average . 
The current-account gap , at 5.5 % of GDP , is by far the highest among the major OECD countries and is at a level long associated - both in the UK and elsewhere - with the onset of financial crises . 
As long as Britain was a haven of political stability and tax policies favorable to foreign investors , it had no problem attracting capital inflows . 
A Labour government , wielding tax proposals specifically designed to hit private foreign investors , would certainly discourage inflows . 
In either case , GDP growth is likely to slow as business confidence , consumption , and house prices suffer - either from new taxes under Labour or from uncertainties about EU membership under the Conservatives . 
Another reason why international observers may be ignoring such obvious risks is that they have been preoccupied with more dramatic events in Greece and Ukraine . 
Politicians , financial analysts , and political commentators have limited time and attention . 
They tend to focus on whatever seems to be the biggest and most urgent story , and British politics has not been it . 
Then again , many apparently sophisticated analysts may simply be in a state of psychological denial . 
Surveys of business and financial opinion in Britain show clear majorities in these groups expecting a sudden swing toward the Conservatives in the closing days of the election campaign , resulting in a stable coalition government and continuity in economic and political conditions . 
Such a last-minute shift in voting intentions is possible , but the time for it is running out . 
In fact , British public opinion has remained uncannily stable , not only during the official election campaign , but throughout the past 12 months . 
There are simply no rational grounds for expecting either the Conservatives or Labour to achieve the decisive victory needed to form a stable government . 
The upcoming election will therefore mark the beginning , not the end , of a period of uncertainty for British politics , economics , and finance . 
No amount of lingering faith in stability will change that .
