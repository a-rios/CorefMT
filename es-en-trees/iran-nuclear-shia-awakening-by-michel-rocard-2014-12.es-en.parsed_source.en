Iran in the Middle 
PARIS - International negotiations over Iran &apos;s nuclear program have been taking place , in one form or another , for more than a decade . 
Iran and its interlocutors - the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany ( the P5 + 1 ) - now have until the end of June to reach an accord . 
It is a dispiriting development , and it would be easy to say that the process seems doomed to fail . 
But there is reason for hope . 
In the ongoing round of negotiations , the two key players , Iran and the United States , have seemed willing - if not desperate - to bring the talks to a successful conclusion . 
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and US President Barack Obama would both benefit from a deal . 
The sanctions imposed on Iran are starting to weigh heavily on its economy , and a settlement to the dispute is a prerequisite for any effort by the two countries to cooperate on a peace deal in Syria or to address the threat posed by the Islamic State . 
Iran is just emerging from a three-year internal political struggle . 
The outcome was uncertain - until Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated a fatwa banning nuclear weapons . 
For as long as the issue remained unsettled , the Iranian delegation to the talks could not agree on the desired outcome . 
This was evident in cases where the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted access to suspected facilities during the negotiations , only to have local commanders turn away its inspectors when they arrived . 
( To be sure , the US delegation has also appeared inconsistent at times , often including officials vehemently hostile to Iran , along with disciplined diplomats seeking an agreement at Obama &apos;s request . ) 
There is also another , more fundamental , reason for hope . 
The Middle East is undergoing a tectonic shift - the Shia awakening . 
As with the slow , sure movement of the earth &apos;s plates , this deep , broad , underlying transformation is manifesting itself in local , destructive eruptions . 
When America &apos;s misguided war in Iraq deposed Saddam Hussein in 2003 , it upset a delicate balance . 
Saddam was venal and cruel , but his regime was predominantly secular . 
Far from harboring weapons of mass destruction , he was focused on maintaining his grip on power . 
Having learned his lesson during Iraq &apos;s brutal and costly war with Iran in the 1980s , Saddam was careful not to disturb the region &apos;s geopolitical equilibrium . 
For more than a thousand years , the Islamic world has been riven by the Sunni-Shia conflict . 
Until the US-led invasion , Iran , alongside Syria &apos;s Alawite regime , was the only country where Shia controlled the state . 
Some 70 % of the Arab world &apos;s population is Sunni , and the Shia are a minority in every Arab country - except Iraq and Bahrain . 
The fall of Saddam allowed Iraq &apos;s Shia majority to take power through elections . 
But it also triggered civil war and regional turmoil ( including ongoing Shia protests in Bahrain ) . 
In Syria , the situation is almost a mirror image . 
The country is a mosaic of Druze , Kurds , Christians , a few Jews , many Shia , and a Sunni majority . 
Like Saddam , President Bashar al-Assad heads a secular regime that rules through brutal repression . 
The determination in the West to depose him in the name of human rights and democracy was perceived by the Sunni majority as an opportunity to overthrow their oppressor . 
Unfortunately , Syria &apos;s moderate Sunnis came under attack from two sides : Assad &apos;s government and extremist adherents of Wahhabism , Islam &apos;s most intolerant school of thought . 
The result is the emergence of the Islamic State , carrying with it the threat of extermination of the country &apos;s minorities , including Christians and Alawites . 
The upheaval in these two neighboring countries has reshaped regional geopolitics . 
Along with Iran , Russia , which seeks to undermine American and British influence in the Middle East , supports the Shia awakening , whereas Sunni-dominated Turkey , the region &apos;s strongest military power and a NATO member , has done little to hide its sympathy for the Islamic State . 
Recently , for example , Turkey &apos;s government forbid the country &apos;s Kurds from supporting their ethnic kin in Iraq and Syria , whom the Islamic State has targeted for annihilation . 
Assad &apos;s brutal regime and Iran have become key players in the fight against the Islamic State . 
Unblocking the nuclear talks between the P5 + 1 and Iran is thus crucial ; by unfreezing the regional status quo , a final deal could lead to a change of alliances , with far-reaching consequences . 
Indeed , perhaps the most compelling reason to hope that the negotiators will move quickly toward an agreement is their governments &quot; fear of the alternatives .
