Time to Bring Mahatma Gandhi Back 
NEW YORK - The Congress Party &apos;s unexpected landslide in India &apos;s general election was greeted with euphoria . 
Many believe that Congress - with its commitment to secular values , economic growth , and helping the poor - now has a mandate to transform India into a great power . 
Business and financial interests , in particular , are delighted with the outcome , crowing about the bonanza about to be unleashed as Congress liberalizes India &apos;s economy further . 
The Americans are happy that India &apos;s pesky left , reduced to a paltry 24 seats , has been all but eliminated from national government . 
India &apos;s Communists had tried to topple the Congress-led government last year in an attempt to scuttle the nuclear deal brokered by the United States , and had vowed to upend it . 
As for the threat from the right , anyone hoping for peace in the region and reduced tensions within India between religious communities is relieved by the defeat of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . 
The BJP &apos;s strategy of painting the Congress as soft on terror and demonizing Muslims as an existential threat to India badly misfired . 
Unfortunately , however , the economic trajectory that Congress is plotting , though it may well boost growth in the short term , is ultimately on a collision course with both equity and sustainability . 
Despite rhetoric about &quot; inclusive growth , &quot; India &apos;s wealth gap has widened during the years of exceptionally rapid economic expansion . 
The majority of the world &apos;s malnourished children live in India . 
While private wealth management is a growth industry among India &apos;s 200,000 or so nouveaux riches , 800 million Indians live on less than $ 2 per day . 
India &apos;s water supply is stretched to the limit , even as global warming is fast melting the Himalayan glaciers on which millions depend for water . 
Moreover , climate change threatens to reduce agricultural output by up to 40 % by 2080 , when India will have another 450 million people . 
At that point , the consultancy McKinsey 
Company projects India &apos;s middle-class consumer market will have hit 600 million people , twice the size of the current US population . 
That &apos;s exciting news to retailers looking for new markets . 
But what about India &apos;s other billion people ? 
And where will the resources come from to manufacture all the stuff these new consumers will buy ? 
The die was cast for India &apos;s development path on July 22 , 1947 , when India &apos;s Constituent Assembly resolved to replace Mahatma Gandhi &apos;s spinning wheel , or charka , with the emperor Ashoka &apos;s wheel of dharma on the Indian national flag . 
The move symbolically rejected what the incoming government abandoned upon assuming office : Gandhi &apos;s vision of an equitable and sustainable agrarian society based on self-sufficient , pared-down consumption . 
For Gandhi , the spinning wheel symbolized the need to assume personal responsibility for consumption as a first step toward achieving justice and freedom for all . 
But Jawaharlal Nehru , India &apos;s first prime minister , believed in industrialization and urbanization , famously calling the new mega-dam projects his government underwrote the &quot; temples of modern India . &quot; 
In his famous speech on India &apos;s &quot; tryst with destiny , &quot; Nehru promised Indians that his government would seek to &quot; bring freedom and opportunity to the common man , to the peasants and workers of India ; to fight and end poverty and ignorance and disease ; ... to ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman . &quot; 
For 63 years , the vast majority of India &apos;s people have waited for this promise to be fulfilled . 
As Congress retakes power , it is Rahul Gandhi , the 39-year-old great-grandson of the man who made that promise , who is the heir-apparent to current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . 
Observers expect the young Gandhi to become prime minister within two years . 
The essential challenge before him and his country is not transitioning from a more to a less state-directed economic system , as many of those cheering Congress &apos;s electoral victory believe . 
While bureaucratic excess , entrenched corruption , and other inefficiencies beg remedy , the real challenge before India is its allegiance to a twentieth-century vision of modernity . 
Former Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram has said that his dream is to see 85 % of Indians living in cities and only 15 % , as opposed to the current 60 % , engaged in agriculture , because to be an agrarian society in the modern era is to be poor and powerless . 
To be &quot; developed &quot; means to be industrialized and urbanized . 
But , for better or worse , we are no longer in the modern era . 
The post-modern realities of our grave present make a mockery of modernity . 
When asked what he thought about Western civilization , Gandhi famously replied , &quot; It would be a good idea . &quot; 
He also said that &quot; Earth provides enough to satisfy every man &apos;s need , but not every man &apos;s greed . &quot; 
For Gandhi , greed led to violence , violence to militarism , militarism to war , and war to annihilation . 
His philosophy of non-violence was aimed at the most basic form of human aggression : the appetite for more than one &apos;s share . 
India &apos;s essential challenge is to take up Gandhi &apos;s mantle and boldly imagine a future that is different from the West &apos;s present . 
Of course , no one is under the illusion that India or any other country will abandon its cities for a life as simple as the one Gandhi strove to live ; but that doesn &apos;t mean that India can &apos;t look to Gandhi &apos;s core values for inspiration . 
Rahul Gandhi bears the name , if not the lineage , of the Mahatma ( to whom he is not related ) . 
If India is lucky , when he assumes leadership of the Congress Party he will let himself be as inspired by Mahatma Gandhi &apos;s vision for India as by that of his great-grandfather . 
After all , it was out of their complicated marriage of ideas that independent India was born . 
Nehru &apos;s vision has had a good run ; now it is time to bring back Gandhi &apos;s .
