Europe &apos;s Test in North Africa 
LONDON - Europe &apos;s reaction to the historic revolutions in North Africa has vacillated between exhilaration and fear . 
The natural instinct to celebrate and support democratization across the Mediterranean has been tempered by concerns that the crisis will spill onto European shores . 
A few leaders have invoked the post-World War II Marshall Plan as a model for large-scale European development assistance for the region , the aim being to ensure the sustainability of a democratic transformation and generate long-term political and economic benefits for Europe . 
But the mainstream reaction has been much more fearful : media and politicians throughout the European Union are obsessing about the threat of waves of migrants reaching their borders . 
Such a threat should not be taken lightly . 
Already , the controversy over Tunisian migrants in Italy has started to fray the political underpinnings that allow free movement in the Schengen area . 
The war in Libya , meanwhile , could lead to many more thousands of civilians fleeing the violence and needing international protection . 
So far , nearly 400,000 people have filled refugee camps in Tunisia and Egypt , and an estimated 20,000 have reached Italy &apos;s shores . 
Dealing with any surge of asylum seekers will require the EU to strengthen its capacity to offer temporary protection - and possibly to reconsider how its overall asylum system works . 
That the Union has been moving towards a common approach to border security , most visibly with the expansion of the Frontex border agency , will be of help here . 
But if Europe allows itself to be consumed by the short-term crisis , it risks squandering an extraordinary long-term opportunity . 
By using this moment strategically and wisely , the EU would have a chance to reframe its relationship with the southern Mediterranean ( as it is being redubbed ) to promote generational development and growth in ways that can address Europe &apos;s interests , too . 
The best way to allay European fears and prevent uncontrolled migration is to establish positive incentives , and the practical means , for potential migrants to stay home - most significantly by creating jobs in the southern Mediterranean . 
After all , the vast majority of migrants leave home reluctantly . 
Yet , at the same time , as its baby boomers retire en masse in the coming decade , Europe will need workers at all skill levels . 
The southern Mediterranean can be the source of this labor , given its huge youth bulge . 
The trick will be to ensure that migrants are given the chance to acquire the skills that European employers need , and that they have the chance to move in a safe , legal , and orderly fashion . 
Policies that help train the next generation of North Africans , and allow them to circulate more freely between Europe and their home countries , are a much smarter solution than the current approach , which sustains illegal migration without meeting Europe &apos;s labor needs . This is an argument not for more migration , but for better migration - well thought out and planned . 
Of course , if Europe helps North Africa build sustainable , prosperous democracies , this would be the greatest long-term deterrent to illegal migration of all . 
It is worth recalling that 50 years ago , the largest immigrant populations in northern Europe hailed from Italy , Greece , Portugal , and Spain . 
As those countries prospered , the émigrés returned home : their countries eventually became engines of European growth , and major export markets for Germany , France , and other EU member states . 
The same arc of development can and should be limned for the southern Mediterranean . 
Fortunately , research on migration and development in recent years has helped foster a range of policy tools that Europe should be considering . Experts and policymakers have been devising many innovative programs , including low-cost remittances from migrants to their home countries , efforts to strengthen ties between diasporas and their homelands , and initiatives that help skilled migrants find proper employment , so that qualified surgeons are not driving taxis . 
In thinking about how to reframe the EU &apos;s relationship with the southern Mediterranean , we should draw on these ideas as expansively as possible . 
In order to connect our societies in positive ways , we should seriously consider liberalizing trade regimes , opening new avenues for legal migration , and vastly expanding the number of students from the region who come to Europe for education and professional training . 
After all , it was the youth of North Africa , both at home and abroad , whose notions of freedom helped bring down dictators in Egypt and Tunisia . 
Their talents and energy should now be cultivated and harnessed to help rebuild their societies . 
Responding to the challenges and opportunities of this moment demands the creation of strong partnerships among states , international institutions , and non-governmental actors . 
Since its inception in 2006 , the Global Forum on Migration and Development ( GFMD ) has provided a much-needed platform for dialogue among states and other stakeholders on issues related to migration and development . 
Its annual plenary sessions facilitate the exchange of experiences and good practices in a way that transcends traditional &quot; North-South &quot; conflicts . 
Among other changes that it has spurred , the GFMD has compelled governments to understand migration more holistically , and to develop a &quot; whole of government &quot; approach to addressing the opportunities and challenges that it poses . 
It also has highlighted the importance to development of protecting migrant rights and of fighting illegal migration . 
The Global Forum has done its job by generating and fostering ideas that can make migration benefit the development of countries of origin and destination . 
It is high time that these ideas are implemented . 
There could be no greater opportunity for doing so than this strategically crucial window in the history of Europe and the southern Mediterranean . 
If we do not seize this moment for action , history could well pass us by .
