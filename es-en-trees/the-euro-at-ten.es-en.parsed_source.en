The Euro at Ten 
PALO ALTO - The beginning of 2009 will long be remembered for terrible economic news and controversial economic policy in virtually every country . 
It also marks the 10th anniversary of the euro , the common currency further knitting together several hundred million Europeans in their economic and financial affairs . 
It is worth pausing to commemorate this remarkable event , and the effect the euro &apos;s existence has had on the current global crisis . 
The euro was launched in January 1999 for a complex set of economic , financial , political , and historical reasons . 
It was the final icing on the cake of the plan by many post-World War II leaders , driven by the memory of two horrible world wars originating in and consuming Europe in the previous half-century , to forge closer economic and political ties . 
Ten years ago , there were real concerns about launching the new currency . 
Would people give up their old national currencies and use the new euro ? 
Would it maintain its value against the dollar ? 
( Launched at $ 1.18 , it plunged to almost $ 0.80 early on , then rose , peaking at nearly $ 1.60 in 2007-2008 , before falling back to around $ 1.30 . ) 
When a group of individual currencies is replaced by a single currency , as the Deutsche mark , French franc , Italian lira , Spanish peseta , and others were by the euro , there are two primary benefits : lower transaction costs and greater transparency . 
Having neither the cost and inconvenience of constant currency transactions nor the uncertainty that arises from fluctuations among currencies is a boon to the common currency area . 
And pricing of goods and labor throughout the currency area , which previously had different exchange rates , becomes much more transparent . 
The cost of cell-phone minutes in Italy , for example , is much more easily compared to those in Germany or France . 
These twin benefits complement the scale advantages of free-trade areas . 
Europe is still realizing the full potential of these benefits , but struggling with natural cross-border mergers and the failure or replacement of prominent national companies by better competitors from other countries . 
Many proponents of the euro claimed that it would quickly evolve as an alternative reserve currency alongside the dollar , or even replace it , in global markets . 
Most of world trade is still invoiced in dollars , but the euro has gradually emerged as a viable alternative - a strong currency backed by the hard-earned inflation credibility of the European Central Bank . 
What , then , of the costs ? 
Why don &apos;t all nations join currency areas , or why not create a single global currency , as Nobel laureate Robert Mundell suggests ? 
One obvious reason is that there are also disadvantages to a common currency area . 
Suppose that southern Europe is hit much harder by today &apos;s recession than northern Europe . An economy has two potential ways to adapt to and mitigate its downturn . 
First , its currency would naturally depreciate , making exports more competitive and imports more expensive . 
Alternatively , labor could migrate from high-unemployment southern Europe to lower-unemployment northern Europe . 
The United States offers an important example of such labor mobility . 
In the early 1980 &quot; s , when US unemployment reached almost 11 % , many workers moved from the so-called Rust Belt - the hardest-hit industrial area of the upper Midwest - to other parts of the country . 
In the early 1990 &quot; s , when California had a more severe recession , people sought jobs in neighboring states . 
Labor migration operated as a safety valve against even worse unemployment . 
Labor migration in Europe is , historically , far less extensive . 
Many don &apos;t want to abandon the deep roots they have in their home regions ; others don &apos;t want to move to another country , where language and culture may be obstacles . 
With limited labor mobility , and the euro removing the other shock absorber ( exchange-rate adjustments ) , great pressure will fall on those countries with the worst downturns . 
This has led some economists to question whether the euro zone is a good idea at all , and to predict that , when confronted with a test of a severe differential recession , it will break apart . 
Low inflation , no currency risk , decreased transaction costs , and greater transparency have made the euro a success . 
But the decreased flexibility in response to economic shocks will certainly test it . 
At present , it is boldly highlighting the disparate , even discordant , fiscal responses now being embraced by European Union governments . 
This raises the old question about whether a currency union can work without a fiscal union , or at least stronger and more binding fiscal rules ( the Maastricht deficit commitments are too easily breached ) . 
To that we must add coordinated financial regulation and bailout policies , as deposits flow rapidly across borders in response to national guarantees and insurance in the euro zone . 
Will the euro &apos;s second decade be as successful as the first ? 
The financial crisis and deepening recession have created many challenges . 
The euro zone &apos;s less competitive economies are tethered to monetary policy ( interest rates ) set by the ECB , but pursue diverse approaches to bank bailouts and fiscal stimulus . 
Italy and Greece , in particular , face serious debt issues amid financial market concerns about the possibility of default or their leaving the euro zone . 
The gaps between German bond yields and Italian and Greek yields are at record levels . 
The price of default insurance has tripled . 
But the weaker economies get the inflation credibility of the ECB and protection from severe exchange-rate swings . 
Indeed , avoiding continuous competitive devaluations is more a blessing than a curse . 
On balance , that may even make membership more appealing for non-members such as Denmark and Poland .
