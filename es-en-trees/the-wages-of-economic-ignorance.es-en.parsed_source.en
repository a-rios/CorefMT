The Wages of Economic Ignorance 
LONDON - Politicians are masters at &quot; passing the buck . &quot; 
Everything good that happens reflects their exceptional talents and efforts ; everything bad is caused by someone or something else . 
The economy is a classic field for this strategy . 
Three years after the global economy &apos;s near-collapse , the feeble recovery has already petered out in most developed countries , whose economic inertia will drag down the rest . 
Pundits decry a &quot; double-dip &quot; recession , but in some countries the first dip never ended : Greek GDP has been dipping for three years . 
When we ask politicians to explain these deplorable results , they reply in unison : &quot; It &apos;s not our fault . &quot; 
Recovery , goes the refrain , has been &quot; derailed &quot; by the eurozone crisis . 
But this is to turn the matter on its head . 
The eurozone crisis did not derail recovery ; it is the result of a lack of recovery . 
It is the natural , predictable , and ( by many ) predicted result of the main European countries &quot; deliberate policy of repressing aggregate demand . 
That policy was destined to produce a financial crisis , because it was bound to leave governments and banks with depleted assets and larger debts . 
Despite austerity , the forecast of this year &apos;s UK structural deficit has increased from 6.5 % to 8 % - requiring an extra Â£ 22 billion ( $ 34.6 billion ) in cuts a year . 
Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne blame the eurozone crisis ; in fact , their own economic illiteracy is to blame . 
Unfortunately for all of us , the explanation bears repeating nowadays . 
Depressions , recessions , contractions - call them what you will - occur because the private-sector spends less than it did previously . 
This means that its income falls , because spending by one firm or household is income for another . 
In this situation , government deficits rise naturally , as tax revenues decline and spending on unemployment insurance and other benefits rises . 
These &quot; automatic stabilizers &quot; plug part of the private-sector spending gap . 
But if the government starts reducing its own deficit before private-sector spending recovers , the net result will be a further decline in total spending , and hence in total income , causing the government &apos;s deficit to widen , rather than narrow . 
True , if governments stop spending altogether , deficits will eventually fall to zero . 
People will starve to death in the interim , but the budget will be balanced . 
That is the crazy logic of current economic policy in much of Europe ( and elsewhere ) . 
Of course , it will not be carried through to the bitter end . 
Too much will crack along the way - the banks , the monetary system , social cohesion , the legitimacy of the political regime . 
Deficit reduction eventually will be put into cold storage , either openly , as I would prefer , or surreptitiously , as is politicians &quot; way . 
In the United Kingdom , there is already talk of Plan A + . 
Those who see the need for such a growth strategy , but who also want to help their friends , like the idea of tax cuts - especially for the rich . 
This knocks a hole in current deficit-reduction plans , but , provided government continues to cut spending , it has the benefit ( from a conservative &apos;s point of view ) of shrinking the state &apos;s role over time . 
Apart from questions of fairness , cutting top tax rates is an inferior way to increase spending , because the rich have a higher propensity to save . 
Tax reductions should be targeted specifically at the poor if one wants the money to be spent to stimulate the economy . 
In fact , the best option of all is for the government to spend the money itself . 
Governments can do this consistently with a medium-term deficit-reduction plan by making a crucial distinction between their budgets &quot; current and capital accounts . 
The current account covers spending on services and perishable goods that produce no assets . 
The capital account is for buying or building durable assets that give a prospective future return . 
The first is a charge on taxation ; the second is not . 
If today &apos;s accounting rules are too insensitive to make this distinction , a separate entity could do the investing . 
A national investment bank would be capitalized by the government , borrow from the private sector , and invest in infrastructure , housing , and &quot; greening &quot; the economy . 
This would simultaneously plug a hole in demand and improve the economy &apos;s long-term growth prospects . 
There are signs that officials in the UK and the United States are starting to move in this direction . 
If nothing works , it will be time to sprinkle the country with what Milton Friedman called &quot; helicopter money &quot; - that is , put purchasing power directly into people &apos;s pockets , by giving every household a spending voucher with an expiration date . 
This would at least keep the economy afloat pending the development of the longer-term investment program . 
It would be better if such schemes could be agreed upon by all by G-20 countries , as was briefly the case in the coordinated stimulus of April 2009 . 
If not , groups of countries should pursue them on their own . 
The European Union desperately needs a growth strategy . 
Its current bailout schemes only help countries like Greece and Italy to borrow money cheaply in the face of prohibitively high market interest rates , while the schemes &quot; insistence on more budget-deficit reduction in these countries will reduce European purchasing power further . 
The recipient governments will have to cut their spending ; the banks will have to take large losses . 
In the long run , the eurozone must be recognized as a failed experiment . 
It should be reconstituted with far fewer members , including only countries that do not run persistent current-account deficits . 
Everything else that has been proposed to save the eurozone in its current form - a central treasury , a monetary authority that does more than target inflation , fiscal harmonization , a new treaty - is a political pipe dream .
