China &apos;s Perfect Storm 
New York - A perfect storm is brewing that could threaten China &apos;s relations with the world . 
Although some China bashers in the West and nationalists in China may be rejoicing , the potential deterioration of China &apos;s international relations serves nobody &apos;s interest and threatens to undermine global peace and security . 
As the Beijing Olympics approach , what the Chinese seem to want most - that the Games herald China &apos;s return as a leader among nations - appears close to slipping from their grasp . 
If things go wrong , China could move to embrace isolation . 
The uprising in Tibet , and the government &apos;s response , have highlighted ethnic tensions within China that the Chinese government is having difficulty managing . 
Politically unable to accept or sufficiently address the aspirations of the Tibetan protestors , China &apos;s authorities have focused almost exclusively on the narrow law-and-order issues connected with the violence in March . 
For many in the West who sympathize with Tibetans &quot; aspirations for more meaningful autonomy under Chinese sovereignty , China &apos;s crackdown , vilification of the Dalai Lama , and hard-line approach have fueled disenchantment . 
Many Chinese , however , came to view pro-Tibetan protests in Paris , London , San Francisco , Delhi , and elsewhere as an effort to sabotage the Olympics and keep China down after almost two centuries of perceived national humiliation . 
China has recently suffered other public-relations disasters as well . 
The Chinese ship containing arms for the reviled Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe is finally headed home after protests and global condemnation prevented it from delivering its cargo . 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for a full arms embargo of Zimbabwe , a position clearly targeted at the Chinese . 
Moreover , the international community continues to pillory China for its arms sales to Sudan , which is believed to have used the weapons in the Darfur genocide . 
Moreover , after a seemingly unending litany of stories about tainted Chinese products , a row has now erupted between China and the United States regarding contaminated Chinese heparin , a blood thinner . 
Although Chinese authorities have disputed US claims that Chinese-made heparin led to at least 81 American deaths , the scientific evidence has damaged China &apos;s credibility and has strengthened perceptions around the world that Chinese products are unregulated and unsafe . 
Finally , growing economic insecurity is creating a backlash against trade and globalization , which may significantly alter attitudes towards China . 
As Americans and other Westerners increasingly perceive China as a country unable to address its political problems and addicted to growth at all costs , the Chinese government appears to be reverting to a national narrative of victimization that has poisonous roots in China &apos;s perception of historical events such as the 1899-1901 Boxer rebellion . 
If the Olympics turn out to be a public relations disaster - because of potential protests by Tibetan , Uighur , or Falun Gong activists or supporters , a lockdown in China of foreign journalists , or even doping scandals - there is a real chance that the Chinese will blame the West , particularly America . 
Because China &apos;s rise is an irreversible fact , all of those who believe that it must become more of a &quot; responsible stakeholder &quot; in world affairs cannot wish for its return to nationalist isolation . 
Just as China needs access to world markets , the world needs China to become a full partner in addressing major global challenges . 
Both sides owe each other an open and honest dialogue to help realize this outcome . 
Western critics of China have every right to protest any aspect of Chinese behavior , and vice versa . 
Certainly , America &apos;s actions in Iraq , contribution to global warming , and uneven commitment to multilateral problem-solving leave a much room for criticism of US behavior both . 
At the same time , those protesting Chinese behavior must remember that China &apos;s rise has brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty , and that China is playing a far more positive role in international relations now than at any other time in its recent history . 
Chinese leaders must in turn work to prevent China &apos;s national narrative from returning to one of victimization , even if problems surrounding the Olympics emerge , as they likely will . 
China &apos;s recent willingness to reopen a dialogue with envoys of the Dalai Lama , and improvement in its relations with Taiwan demonstrate that there is room for creating a more positive environment . 
The storm is on the horizon , but there may still be time to prepare to weather it safely .
