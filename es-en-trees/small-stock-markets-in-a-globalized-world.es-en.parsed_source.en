Small Stock Markets in a Globalized World 
Globalization means the unavoidable transformation of nations , businesses , and individuals - in Africa no less than anywhere else in the world . 
All must adapt , and stock exchanges are no exception . 
As technological advances in information technology combine with de-regulation and globalization to fuel growing competition , the world &apos;s securities markets are being forced to update , consolidate , and expand their activities , and to rationalize their governance structures in order to become more cost efficient , transparent , and accountable . 
Emerging markets , like those on the African continent , including the two leaders South Africa and Egypt , have no choice but to follow the lead of the global securities industry , because globalization has changed stock exchanges &apos; traditional role . 
The internet and computer-based trading have shattered geographic boundaries and revolutionized investment , not only by opening up new avenues for trading , but by democratizing access to information that was once the exclusive preserve of professional investors . 
However large or small , whether in a Cairo internet caf√© or a New York office , today &apos;s investors demand , and increasingly get , instant information and immediate execution of trades . 
Navigating these changes is essential for emerging-market stock exchanges if they are to be competitive on a global level . 
In particular , they must prepare themselves to deal with falling prices for financial services . 
The global investor of tomorrow will be able to execute transactions more efficiently and less expensively than ever before , as better technology and heightened competition essentially push trading costs to zero . 
Thus , in order to maintain cash flow , stock exchanges must enhance their services to deliver higher added value . 
For example , stock exchanges have already begun extending trading hours into the evening , earlier in the morning or both , deepening liquidity and benefiting investors , issuers , and brokers alike . 
In light of these innovations , the next generation of stock markets must invest substantially in technology to enable instant worldwide price discovery and trade execution in a fair , orderly , low-cost , and well-regulated environment without time-zone limitations . 
This may require broader &quot; demutualization , &quot; a step currently under consideration by the Bombay , Kuala Lumpur , New Zealand , and Sao Paulo stock exchanges following its successful implementation by exchanges in Australia , Sweden , Hong Kong , Singapore , and London . 
African exchanges should consider it , too . 
Demutualization means transforming a stock exchange into a for-profit organization , with shares that can be owned by members , financial institutions , and the public . 
Under this scheme , the long-term profitability and survival of an exchange depends on the value of its traded shares , just like any other listed company . 
The main advantage of demutualization for stock exchanges is that it puts an end to the ownership monopoly of member firms , who are often reluctant to take decisions that benefit the market and issuers but that conflict with their own vested interests . 
In particular , demutualization will allow stock markets greater leeway to merge , acquire each other , or form partnerships , creating a few truly global giants . 
This will help expose foreign investors to listed companies at home and local investors to companies abroad . 
The efficiencies created by these economies of scale can then be passed on to investors and issuers alike . 
Serious challenges remain , of course , including differences in securities legislation , listing and trading rules , information disclosure requirements , and clearing , settlement , and payment systems . 
Thus , the world is not likely to move to a single consolidated securities market anytime soon , but rather to a collection of diverse markets that include some domestic players and others with a more global reach . 
Stock exchanges in emerging markets will increasingly be forced to contemplate regional or global integration or alliances , lest they remain solely domestic in nature . 
As the internationalization of securities markets progresses , however , there will be less to contemplate . 
Listing and trading rules will be harmonized , and standards of information disclosure will become uniform across exchanges . 
Global regulatory initiatives , particularly those aimed at standardizing accounting and other disclosure requirements , will be enforced vigorously . 
These changes will further empower investors , giving them greater control over trading via access to company information that is formatted to a global standard . 
For the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange , where I work , and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange - Africa &apos;s two largest - the agenda is clear . 
They must adopt listing rules that emphasize timely disclosure for both domestic and international investors , implement international accounting standards , and prohibit insider trading in order to encourage listings by local and regional blue-chip issuers and attract international investors . 
Indeed , as the recent collapse of corporate giants such as Enron and World.com clearly demonstrates , the ability to protect investors adequately and retain their confidence will be crucial for securities markets to compete effectively as globalization proceeds . 
This is even truer in emerging-market exchanges , where one bad apple can ruin the reputation of an entire country &apos;s business . 
More than ever before , an attractive market will be one that provides the highest value of all : fair and effective regulation . 
In short , stock exchanges in Africa and in emerging markets elsewhere will not survive the globalization of the securities industry unless they focus on improving their transparency , integrity , and efficiency . 
Ensuring sound corporate governance and protection of minority shareholders &apos; rights must come first .
