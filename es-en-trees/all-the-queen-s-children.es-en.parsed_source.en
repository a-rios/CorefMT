All the Queen &apos;s Children 
NEW YORK - Does monarchy - constitutional monarchy , that is , not the despotic kind - have any redeeming features left ? 
The arguments against maintaining kings and queens are mostly quite rational . 
It is unreasonable in this democratic age to pay special deference to people solely on the basis of their birth . 
Are we really supposed to admire and love modern monarchies , such as the British House of Windsor , even more so today , just because some new princess has been plucked from the middle class ? 
Monarchy has an infantilizing effect . 
Witness how otherwise sensible adults are reduced to nervously grinning sycophants when they are granted the privilege of touching an extended royal hand . 
At great monarchical displays , such as the royal wedding in London , millions become enthralled by child-like dreams of a &quot; fairy-tale &quot; marriage . 
The mystique of immense wealth , noble birth , and great exclusivity is further sustained by the global mass media that promote these rituals . 
Now , one might argue that the dignified pomp of Queen Elizabeth II is preferable to the tawdry grandiosity of Silvio Berlusconi , Madonna , or Cristiano Ronaldo . 
In fact , the British monarchy , especially , has been reinventing itself by adopting many of the most vulgar features of modern showbiz or sports celebrity . 
And the worlds of royalty and popular fame often overlap . 
For example , David Beckham and his ex-pop-star wife Victoria , live out their own dream of royalty , aping some of its gaudiest aspects . 
They also happened to be among the favored guests at the latest royal wedding . 
Similarly , while Britain has many outstanding musicians , the favorite of the royal court is Elton John . 
Infantile or not , there is a common human craving for taking vicarious pleasure in the lives of kings , queens , and other shining stars . 
To call these people &apos;s ostentatious displays of extravagance wasteful is to miss the point : a world of glittering dreams that must remain entirely beyond our grasp is precisely what many people want to see . 
But there is another , darker side to this craving , which is the wish to see idols dragged through the mud in vicious gossip magazines , divorce courts , and so on . 
This is the vengeful side of our fawning , as though the humiliation of worshipping idols must be balanced by our delight in their downfall . 
Indeed , to subject people who are born into royal families , or people who marry into them , to lives in a fishbowl , where they are on constant display , like actors and actresses in a continuous soap opera , where human relations are distorted and stunted by absurd rules of protocol , is a terrible form of cruelty . 
The current Japanese empress and her daughter-in-law , both from non-aristocratic families , have had nervous breakdowns as a result . 
Likewise , movie stars often fall victim to alcohol , drugs , and breakdowns , but at least they have chosen the lives they live . 
Kings and queens , on the whole , have not . 
Prince Charles might have been far happier as a gardener , but this was never an option . 
One thing to be said for monarchs is that they provide people with a sense of continuity , which can be useful in times of crisis or radical change . 
The King of Spain provided stability and continuity after the end of Franco &apos;s dictatorship . 
During World War II , European monarchs kept a sense of hope and unity alive among their subjects under Nazi occupation . 
But there is something else , too . 
Jews were among the most loyal subjects of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor . 
Franz Joseph I stood up for his Jewish subjects when they were threatened by German anti-Semites . 
To him , Jews , Germans , Czechs , or Hungarians were all his subjects , wherever they lived , from the smallest Galician shtetl to the grand capitals of Budapest or Vienna . 
This offered some protection to minorities at a time of rising ethnic nationalism . 
In this sense , monarchy is a little like Islam , or the Catholic Church : all believers are supposed to be equal in the eyes of God , or the Pope , or the Emperor - hence the appeal to the poor and the marginalized . 
This might explain some right-wing populists &quot; animus against monarchy . 
The Dutch populist leader Geert Wilders , for example , has denounced Queen Beatrix on several occasions as a leftist , elitist , and multiculturalist . 
Like the new wave of populists worldwide , Wilders promises to take his country back for his followers , to stop immigration ( especially of Muslims ) , and to make the Netherlands Dutch again , whatever that means . 
Beatrix , like Franz Joseph , refuses to make ethnic or religious distinctions between her subjects . 
That is what she means when she preaches tolerance and mutual understanding . 
To Wilders and his supporters , this is a sign of her molly-coddling of aliens , of appeasing Muslims . 
To them , the queen seems almost anti-Dutch . 
To be sure , like all European royal families , the origins of the Dutch royal family are decidedly mixed . 
The emergence of kings and queens as specifically national figureheads is a relatively recent historical development . 
Empires contained many nations , after all . 
Queen Victoria , mostly of German blood , did not regard herself as a monarch of Britons alone , but of Indians , Malays , and many other peoples , too . 
This aristocratic tradition of standing above the narrow strains of ethnic nationalism may be the best argument to hang on to royalty a little longer . 
Now that many European nations have become increasingly mixed in terms of ethnicity and culture , the only way forward is to learn to live together . 
If monarchs can teach their subjects to do so , then let us give at least one cheer for the remaining kings and queens .
