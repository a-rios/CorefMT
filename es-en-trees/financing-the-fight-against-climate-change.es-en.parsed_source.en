Financing the Fight against Climate Change 
COPENHAGEN - It is now generally agreed that the developed countries will have to make a substantial financial contribution to enable the developing world to deal with climate change . 
Funds are needed to invest in new low-carbon energy sources , reforestation and protection of rain forests , land-use changes , and adaptation and mitigation . 
But there is no similar agreement on where the money will come from . 
The developed countries are reluctant to make additional financial commitments . 
They have just experienced a significant jump in their national debts , and they still need to stimulate their domestic economies . 
This colors their attitudes . 
It looks like they will be able to cobble together a &quot; fast-start &quot; fund of $ 10 billion a year for the next few years , but more does not fit into their national budgets . 
This is unlikely to satisfy the developing countries . 
I believe that this amount could be at least doubled and assured for a longer time span . 
Developed countries &quot; governments are laboring under the misapprehension that funding must come from their national budgets . 
But that is not the case . 
They have the money already . 
It is lying idle in their reserve accounts at the International Monetary Fund . 
Spending it would not add to any country &apos;s fiscal deficit . All they need to do is to tap into it . 
In September 2009 , the IMF distributed to its members $ 283 billion worth of Special Drawing Rights , an arcane financial instrument , but one that essentially constitutes additional foreign exchange . 
They can be used only by converting them into one of four currencies , at which point they begin to carry interest at those currencies &quot; combined treasury-bill rate . 
At present , the interest rate is less than 0.5 % . 
Of the $ 283 billion worth of recently distributed SDRs , more than $ 150 billion went to the 15 largest developed economies . 
These SDRs will sit largely untouched in the reserve accounts of these countries , which don &apos;t really need any additional reserves . 
I propose that the developed countries - in addition to establishing a fast-start fund of $ 10 billion a year - band together and lend $ 100 billion dollars worth of these SDRs for 25 years to a special green fund serving the developing world . 
The fund would jump-start forestry , land-use , and agricultural projects - areas that offer the greatest scope for reducing or mitigating carbon emissions , and that could produce substantial returns from carbon markets . 
The returns such projects could generate go beyond addressing carbon emissions . 
Returns from land-use projects , for example , could also include the potential to create more sustainable rural livelihoods , enable higher and more resilient agricultural yields , and generate rural employment . 
This is a simple and practical idea , and there is a precedent for it . 
The United Kingdom and France each recently lent $ 2 billion worth of SDRs to a special fund at the IMF to support concessionary lending to the poorest countries . At that point , the IMF assumed responsibility for the principal and interest on the SDRs . 
The same could be done in this case . 
I further propose that member countries agree to use the IMF &apos;s gold reserves to guarantee the interest payments and repayment of the principal . 
The IMF owns a lot of gold - more than 100 million ounces - and it is on the books at historical cost . 
Thus , at current market prices , it is worth more than $ 100 billion over its book value . 
It has already been designated to be used for the benefit of the least developed countries . 
The proposed green fund would meet this requirement . 
This means that the developed countries that lend the SDRs would incur no interest expense and no responsibility for repayment . There are some serious technical problems involved in offsetting the interest income against the interest expense , particularly in the United States , but the net effect would be a wash . 
These technical difficulties stood in the way of previous attempts to put the SDRs to practical use , but they do not apply to the proposed green fund . 
There are three powerful arguments in favor of this proposal . 
First , the green fund could be self-financing or even profitable ; very little of the IMF &apos;s gold , if any , would actually be used . 
Second , the projects will earn a return only if developed countries cooperate in setting up the right type of carbon markets . 
Establishing a green fund would be an implicit pledge to do so by putting the gold reserves of the IMF at risk . 
Finally , this money would be available now , jump-starting carbon-saving projects . 
For all these reasons , the developing countries ought to embrace my proposal . 
The key point is that it is possible to increase substantially the amount available to fight global warming in the developing world by using the existing allocations of SDRs , with interest payments on them guaranteed by the IMF &apos;s gold reserves . 
All that is lacking is the political will . The mere fact that tapping SDRs requires Congressional approval in the US ensures that nothing will happen without public pressure - including pressure from the developing countries . 
Yet it could make the difference between success and failure in Copenhagen .
