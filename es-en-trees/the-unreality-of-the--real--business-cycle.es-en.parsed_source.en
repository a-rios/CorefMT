The Unreality of the &quot; Real &quot; Business Cycle 
LONDON - Testifying recently before a United States congressional committee , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said that the recent financial meltdown had shattered his &quot; intellectual structure . &quot; 
I am keen to understand what he meant . 
Since I have had no opportunity to ask him , I have to rely on his memoirs , The Age of Turbulence , for clues . 
But that book was published in 2007 - before , presumably , his intellectual structure fell apart . 
In his memoirs , Greenspan revealed that his favorite economist was Joseph Schumpeter , inventor of the concept of &quot; creative destruction . &quot; 
In Greenspan &apos;s summary of Schumpeter &apos;s thinking , a &quot; market economy will incessantly revitalize itself from within by scrapping old and failing businesses and then reallocating resources to newer , more productive ones . &quot; 
Greenspan had seen &quot; this pattern of progress and obsolescence repeat over and over again . &quot; 
Capitalism advanced the human condition , said Schumpeter , through a &quot; perennial gale of creative destruction , &quot; which he likened to a Darwinian process of natural selection to secure the &quot; survival of the fittest . &quot; 
As Greenspan tells it , the &quot; rougher edges &quot; of creative destruction were legislated away by Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s New Deal , but after the wave of de-regulation of the 1970 &quot; s , America recovered much of its entrepreneurial , risk-taking ethos . 
As Greenspan notes , it was the dot-com boom of the 1990 &quot; s that &quot; finally gave broad currency to Schumpeter &apos;s idea of creative destruction . &quot; 
This was the same Greenspan who in 1996 warned of &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; and , then , as Fed chairman , did nothing to check it . 
Both the phrase and his lack of action make sense in the light of his ( now shattered ) intellectual system . 
It is impossible to imagine a continuous gale of creative destruction taking place except in a context of boom and bust . 
Indeed , early theorists of business cycles understood this . 
( Schumpeter himself wrote a huge , largely unreadable book , with that title in 1939 . ) 
In classic business-cycle theory , a boom is initiated by a clutch of inventions - power looms and spinning jennies in the eighteenth century , railways in the nineteenth century , automobiles in the twentieth century . 
But competitive pressures and the long gestation period of fixed-capital outlays multiply optimism , leading to more investment being undertaken than is actually profitable . 
Such over-investment produces an inevitable collapse . 
Banks magnify the boom by making credit too easily available , and they exacerbate the bust by withdrawing it too abruptly . 
But the legacy is a more efficient stock of capital equipment . 
Dennis Robertson , an early twentieth-century &quot; real &quot; business-cycle theorist , wrote : &quot; I do not feel confident that a policy which , in the pursuit of stability of prices , output , and employment , had nipped in the bud the English railway boom of the forties , or the American railway boom of 1869-71 , or the German electrical boom of the nineties , would have been on balance beneficial to the populations concerned . &quot; 
Like his contemporary , Schumpeter , Robertson regarded these boom-bust cycles , which involved both the creation of new capital and the destruction of old capital , as inseparable from progress . 
Contemporary &quot; real &quot; business-cycle theory builds a mountain of mathematics on top of these early models , the main effect being to minimize the &quot; destructiveness &quot; of the &quot; creation . &quot; 
It manages to combine technology-driven cycles of booms and recessions with markets that always clear ( i.e. , there is no unemployment ) . 
How is this trick accomplished ? 
When a positive technological &quot; shock &quot; raises real wages , people will work more , causing output to surge . 
In the face of a negative &quot; shock , &quot; workers will increase their leisure , causing output to fall . 
These are efficient responses to changes in real wages . 
No intervention by government is needed . 
Bailing out inefficient automobile companies like General Motors only slows down the rate of progress . 
In fact , whereas most schools of economic thought maintain that one of government &apos;s key responsibilities is to smooth the cycle , &quot; real &quot; business-cycle theory argues that reducing volatility reduces welfare ! 
It is hard to see how this type of theory either explains today &apos;s economic turbulence , or offers sound instruction about how to deal with it . 
First , in contrast to the dot-com boom , it is difficult to identify the technological &quot; shock &quot; that set off the boom . 
Of course , the upswing was marked by super-abundant credit . 
But this was not used to finance new inventions : it was the invention . 
It was called securitized mortgages . 
It left no monuments to human invention , only piles of financial ruin . 
Second , this type of model strongly implies that governments should do nothing in the face of such &quot; shocks . &quot; 
Indeed , &quot; real &quot; business-cycle economists typically argue that , but for Roosevelt &apos;s misguided New Deal policies , recovery from the Great Depression of 1929-1933 would have been much faster than it was . 
Equivalent advice today would be that governments the world over are doing all the wrong things in bailing out top-heavy banks , subsidizing inefficient businesses , and putting obstacles in the way of rational workers spending more time with their families or taking lower-paid jobs . 
It reminds me of the interviewer who went to see Robert Lucas , one of the high priests of the New Business Cycle school , at a time of high American unemployment in the 1980 &quot; s . 
&quot; My driver is an unemployed Ph.D. graduate , &quot; he said to Lucas . 
&quot; Well , I &apos;d say that if he is driving a taxi , he &apos;s a taxi-driver , &quot; replied the 1995 Nobel Laureate . 
Although Schumpeter brilliantly captured the inherent dynamism of entrepreneur-led capitalism , his modern &quot; real &quot; successors smothered his insights in their obsession with &quot; equilibrium &quot; and &quot; instant adjustments . &quot; 
For Schumpeter , there was something both noble and tragic about the spirit of capitalism . 
But those sentiments are a world away from the pretty , polite techniques of his mathematical progeny .
