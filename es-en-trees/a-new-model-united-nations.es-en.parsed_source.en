A New Model United Nations 
The award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the United Nations and to its Secretary General , Kofi Annan , is a cause for true celebration everywhere . 
Yes , the UN has achieved much under Secretary General Annan &apos;s leadership . 
But the idea of the United Nations as a uniter of nations remains , in many parts of the world and for many of the world &apos;s most complex problems , more an ideal still to be achieved than a living reality . 
Some of the most powerful nations in the world still do not see fully cooperating with or participating in UN affairs as in their interest . 
Beyond states , the world &apos;s many NGOs are growing fast and multiplying in their influence , but without formal rules to define their role in the international system . 
Their real power , despite Secretary General Annan &apos;s efforts to create a dialogue with them , stands outside the UN framework . 
Indeed , NGOs often assume tasks for which the current structure of the UN is unsuited or remains far too weak . 
To assist them in their tasks , and to assure that the great global issues of the day are addressed in a forum that unites and does not divide , the UN needs to be strengthened in the fields in which NGO &apos;s are working so impressively . 
Such strengthening can only be achieved by a fundamental reform of the UN &apos;s internal structure . 
When the UN was founded in 1945 , the primary objective was to prevent the outbreak of World War III . 
So , at its foundation , only one powerful body was introduced , the Security Council on which the world &apos;s great military powers sat . 
The agenda of the Security Council was and remains power , and meeting crises , mostly with military means . 
Today , however , the real threats to the majority of the world &apos;s population stems from dangers almost unknown back then : poverty , hunger , population growth , migration , the environment , and the like . 
For the UN to meet these challenges , its very structure must change . 
Two new councils , each with comparable power to the Security Council , are needed : a Social Council and an Economic Council . 
The IMF , World Bank , and WTO should not only report to , but be dependent upon this new UN reformed structure . 
Why are these new bodies needed ? 
The world cannot do without rules ; it cannot move forward against our age &apos;s most pressing problems without defined legal rules and the institutions that regulate international law . 
Because these institutions do not exist , the UN must now invent them . 
Of course some rules , such as rules governing the promulgation of trade sanctions , now exist within , say , the WTO . 
These rules , however , are but steps in the right direction : steps toward socially and ecologically sustainable free trade and against protectionism , especially that often practiced by rich countries . 
Across the board , more global rules are needed so that global efforts to confront poverty , disease , and mass migration can be made consistent , predictable and most of all effective . 
We have the Rome Statute of International Criminal Code ; we are heading for an innovative guide to best practice on how civil society organizations can best contribute to the work of the UN ; and we now have a large coalition , far beyond NATO , combatting terrorism . 
I am grateful that one of the reactions to September 11th was , if I am not mistaken , a somewhat changed attitude within the USA vis-Ã -vis the UN . 
But it is of a paramount importance that these kinds of change , namely , to incorporate real power into the structure of the UN , make more progress . 
In dangerous times such as these , the world &apos;s peoples need to prove their solidarity . 
The large coalition now fighting terrorism is one way to demonstrate this . 
But solidarity also must be recognized within the real power structures of the UN . 
The Secretary General convocation of a &quot; Dialogue of Civilizations &quot; is but a start here . 
Far more needs to be done . 
The institution of Social and Economic Councils at the UN would mark an enormous step in the right direction . 
I have tried to present the ideas outlined here not only to the General Assembly but also to the permanent members of the Security Council . 
I have also been invited to present them to the US Senate . 
So far , none of those discussions have proved to be very fruitful . 
But just as the time is coming when the US will to come see the UN as indispensable , the Security Council and its members will come to see the creation of new bodies within the UN not as rivals , but as the only means for the world &apos;s people , in solidarity , to confront the myriad social and economic problems that they face .
