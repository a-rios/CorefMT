Kerry vs. Bush : Will Reason Prevail ? 
With over 1,000 US deaths in Iraq , and the huge pressures that the occupation of that benighted country has put on American troops around the world , it is clear that - for the first time in decades - foreign policy issues may determine the outcome of a US presidential election . 
What price must be paid for that supremacy to be maintained ? 
What limits on the use of US military power are acceptable or necessary ? 
These have long been dominant questions in America &apos;s strategic debate . 
But , after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , they became confused with another debate , one far more important for a US electorate that feels threatened : how can alliances and multilateral institutions protect Americans ? 
John Kerry &apos;s great virtue has been to resist confusing the demand for security and peace with the hegemonic impulses of America the hyper-power . 
Nationalist and neo-conservative currents within the Bush administration believe that unilateral action best serves US interests because it handcuffs American power the least . 
On this view , the security of the US can be guaranteed through energetic military action , with or without allies . 
Hence the Bush administration &apos;s tendency to weaken the ties of America &apos;s permanent alliances , including those that NATO represents . 
Unilateral announcement of troop reductions in Europe and Asia , where US forces primarily serve ( as in South Korea ) to dissuade aggression , can only be seen as a corollary of this tendency . 
The Bush doctrine &apos;s bedrock notion is that of &quot; pre-emptive war , &quot; a doctrine that lacks international legitimacy and that therefore can usually count on only a limited number of allies . 
The idea behind pre-emptive wars is that American force should be projected through high-tech , blitzkrieg type wars waged from US soil , or from the soil of uncritical allies . 
On this view , NATO is merely to serve as a means to mobilize Europeans to tackle the inevitable postwar stabilization and reconstruction missions - obviating the need for the US to place its forces under NATO command . 
This is what happened in Afghanistan . 
But as NATO &apos;s Secretary General has said , if it is the mission that defines the coalition , then NATO - a permanent alliance - is no longer needed . 
John Kerry is focused upon the same type of security problems as Bush . 
This leaves many observers skeptical about the possibility for real change . 
Where he differs fundamentally from Bush is in his belief that resolving international problems that affect the US almost always calls for the support of others . 
He therefore considers the revival of America &apos;s alliances to be a key foreign policy priority , and he has proposed that US forces in Iraq should be integrated into a NATO operation , as long as this remains under US command . 
Acting jointly means that the US will have to take into account other interests and views - views that may not always be in harmony with its own . 
America will have to accept a world that is regulated not by the US unilaterally , but by global institutions and permanent alliances . 
And the norms and rules that govern international institutions constitute a boundary on American power - and thus as a check on its hegemony . 
Kerry and a growing number of Americans recognize that accepting limits on US power and the use of military force are a precondition for America &apos;s ultimate security , that what binds can also strengthen , and that such limits will reinforce America &apos;s ability to tackle the crisis in Iraq . 
Kerry knows that in most cases military power alone cannot be decisive , as there are other dimensions of power - so-called &quot; soft power &quot; - that are essential to resolving crises and establishing peace . 
These dimensions include international legitimacy , values ( including tolerance ) , and public opinion . 
The coming US election recalls a famous debate described by Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian War , concerning how Athens should respond to the revolt of Mytilene . 
The vote supported those who felt that &quot; those who make wise decisions are more formidable to their enemies than those who rush madly into strong action . &quot; 
Let us hope that reason also prevails this time round .
