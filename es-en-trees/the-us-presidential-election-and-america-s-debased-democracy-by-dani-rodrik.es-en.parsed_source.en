America &apos;s Third-World Politics 
CAMBRIDGE - With its presidential election over , the United States can finally take a breather from campaign politics , at least for a while . 
Maybe that is too harsh an assessment of Africa &apos;s nascent democracies . 
If you think I exaggerate , you have not been paying close attention . 
The pandering to extremist groups , the rejection of science , the outright lies and distortions , and the evasion of the real issues that characterized the most recent election cycle set a new low for democratic politics . 
Without question , the worst offenders are America &apos;s Republicans , whose leaders have somehow become enraptured by ideas that are beyond the pale in other advanced countries . 
Of the party &apos;s dozen presidential candidates , only two ( Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman ) declined to reject scientific evidence concerning global warming and its human causes . 
But , when pressed on it , Romney was sufficiently uncomfortable about his position that he wobbled on the issue . 
The Darwinian theory of evolution has long been a dirty word among Republicans as well . Rick Perry , the governor of Texas and an early frontrunner in the Republican primary , called it just a &quot; theory out there , &quot; while Romney himself has had to argue that it is consistent with creationism - the idea that an intelligent force designed the universe and brought it into being . 
Likewise , if there is an archaic idea in economics , it is that the US should return to the Gold Standard . 
Yet , this idea , too , has strong support within the Republican Party - led by Ron Paul , another contender for the party &apos;s presidential nomination . 
No one was surprised when the party &apos;s platform gave a nod to the Gold Standard in its convention in August . 
Most non-Americans would find it crazy that neither Romney nor Barack Obama supported stricter gun-control laws ( with Obama making an exception only for assault weapons such as AK-47s ) , in a country where it is sometimes easier to buy guns than it is to vote . 
Most Europeans cannot understand how , in a civilized country , both candidates can favor the death penalty . 
Candidate Romney was so cowed by his party &apos;s obsession with low taxes that he never put forth a budget that added up . 
It was left to his spinners to explain , as The Economist put it , that this was &quot; necessary rubbish , concocted to persuade the fanatics who vote in the Republican primaries . &quot; 
Obama , for his part , catered to economic nationalists by attacking Romney as an &quot; outsourcing pioneer &quot; and calling him an &quot; outsourcer in chief &quot; - as if outsourcing were evil , could be stopped , or Obama himself had done much to discourage it . 
So rampant were the equivocations , untruths , and outright lies from both camps that many media outlets and non-partisan groups maintained running lists of factual distortions . 
One of the best known , FactCheck.org , an initiative of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania , confessed that this campaign had kept them exceptionally busy . 
Some of the most egregious examples included Obama &apos;s claims that Romney was planning to raise taxes by $ 2,000 on middle-income taxpayers and / or cut taxes by $ 5 trillion , and that Romney backed a law that would outlaw &quot; all abortions , even in cases of rape and incest . &quot; 
Romney went even further , claiming that Obama planned to raise taxes by $ 4,000 on middle-income taxpayers ; that Obama planned &quot; to gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements &quot; ; and that Chrysler , bailed out by the Obama administration , was moving all of its Jeep production to China . 
None of these claims was true . 
&quot; It &apos;s been that sort of campaign , &quot; FactCheck.org &apos;s analysts wrote , &quot; filled from beginning to end with deceptive attacks and counterattacks , and dubious claims . &quot; 
Meanwhile , over the course of three televised presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate , climate change , the signature issue of our time and the most serious problem confronting our planet , was not mentioned even once . 
One can draw two possible conclusions from America &apos;s election . 
One is that the US will ultimately be undone by the poor quality of its democratic discourse , and that it is merely at the start of an inevitable decline . 
The symptoms are there , even if the disease has not yet infected the entire body . 
The other possibility is that what is said and done during an election makes little difference to a polity &apos;s health . 
Campaigns are always a time for cheap populism and kowtowing to single-issue fundamentalists . 
Perhaps what really matters is what happens after a candidate takes office : the quality of the checks and balances within which he or she operates , the advice offered , the decisions taken , and , ultimately , the policies pursued . 
But , if American elections are nothing other than entertainment , why is so much money spent on them , and why do so many people get so exercised over them ? 
Can the answer be that the outcome would be even worse otherwise ? 
To paraphrase Winston Churchill , elections are the worst way to select a political leader , save for all other methods that have been tried - and nowhere more so than in America .
