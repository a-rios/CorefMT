The North Korean Enigma 
CAMBRIDGE - What is going on in North Korea ? 
On November 23 , its army fired nearly 200 artillery rounds onto the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong , near the two countries &quot; disputed maritime border , killing four - including two civilians - and demolishing scores of houses and other structures . 
The presence of civilians , many of whom had to be evacuated , made North Korea &apos;s attack even more provocative than its sinking in March of the South Korean warship Cheonan , which killed 46 sailors . 
And , just a few weeks before the shelling of Yeonpyeong , North Korea showed a delegation of American scientists a new and previously undisclosed uranium-enrichment plant , which will increase the regime &apos;s capacity to make nuclear weapons . 
North Korea &apos;s nuclear weapons program has been a matter of concern for two decades . 
Pyongyang violated its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by secretly reprocessing enough plutonium to produce two nuclear weapons in the early 1990 &quot; s . 
After it withdrew from a restraining agreement negotiated by the Clinton administration in 1994 , it expelled International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and began reprocessing spent fuel that could produce another six bombs &quot; worth of plutonium . 
Now , with its new enrichment plant , North Korea &apos;s access to fissile materials will greatly increase . 
Its leaders have a reputation for selling dangerous items such as missiles , narcotics , and counterfeit currency , and many worry that they might transfer nuclear materials to other countries or to terrorist groups . 
The recent WikiLeaks disclosures of classified American diplomatic documents , for example , suggest that North Korea has been helping Iran with its advanced missile program . 
George W. Bush &apos;s administration initially hoped that it could solve the North Korean nuclear problem through regime change . 
The idea was that isolation and sanctions would topple Kim Jong-il &apos;s dictatorship . 
But the regime proved resistant , and the Bush administration finally agreed to enter into six-party talks with China , Russia , Japan , and the two Koreas . 
In September 2005 , it fleetingly appeared that the talks had led North Korea to agree to forgo its nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and removal of sanctions . 
But the agreement soon collapsed , and North Korea refused to return to the talks until the United States stopped shutting down bank accounts suspected of counterfeiting and laundering money for Kim &apos;s regime . 
Then , with diplomacy stalled , North Korea launched a series of missiles into the Sea of Japan . 
All five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council agreed on a resolution condemning North Korea &apos;s actions , and China warned North Korea to moderate its behavior . 
Instead , in 2006 , North Korea detonated a nuclear device , and did so again in 2009 . 
Ostensibly , North Korea is a weak country with a disastrous economic system . 
Starting from similar levels a half-century ago , South Korea has grown to become one of the world &apos;s most prosperous economies , with nearly 50 million people enjoying a per capita income of $ 30,000 ( at purchasing price parity ) . 
North Korea has half the population and per capita income of less than $ 2,000 . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , North Korea suffered extreme famine , which probably killed 1-2 million people , and even today North Korea depends on China for food and fuel . 
How , then , can North Korea manage to defy its neighbor ? 
For one thing , North Korea has &quot; the power of weakness . &quot; 
In certain situations , weakness - and the threat that a partner will collapse - can be a source of bargaining power . 
A bankrupt debtor who owes $ 1,000 has little power , but if it owes $ 1 billion , it may have considerable bargaining power - witness the fate of institutions judged &quot; too big to fail &quot; in the 2008 financial crisis . 
As the Financial Times observed , &quot; North Korea &apos;s Kim Jong-il is probably the only world leader who can make Beijing look powerless . 
Diplomats say Kim brazenly plays on Chinese fears . 
If the Chinese do not pump aid into his crumbling economy , he argues , they will face refugees pouring across the border and possible unrest . &quot; 
China does not want a nuclear or belligerent North Korea , but it is even more concerned about a failed state collapsing on its border . 
China has tried to persuade Kim &apos;s regime to follow its market-oriented example , but Kim is afraid that an economic opening would lead to a political opening and loss of dictatorial control . 
So , while China is trying to moderate the current crisis , its influence is limited . 
The other source of North Korea &apos;s power is its audacity in playing a weak hand . 
Yes , a full-scale military invasion would meet with a devastating defeat by superior South Korean and US military forces , whose current naval exercises in the Yellow Sea are designed to remind North Korea of this disparity . 
But , with 15,000 artillery tubes embedded in the Demilitarized Zone , just 30 miles north of Seoul , North Korea knows that firing just a few shells could wreak havoc on the South Korean stock market and economy , while it has less to lose in comparison . 
By flaunting its willingness to take greater risks , the North hopes to further enhance its bargaining power . 
Most observers attribute the recent provocations to the anticipated succession of power in Pyongyang . 
Kim Jong-il had years to prepare as an understudy to his father , Kim Il-sung , but many reports suggest that he is nearing the end of his life . 
This autumn , he promoted his hitherto little-seen son , Kim Jong-un , to the rank of general , and introduced him at a Communist Party conference . 
Demonstration of military success in &quot; protecting &quot; the regime may indeed be designed to strengthen the 28-year-old general &apos;s claim to power . 
If so , the risky behavior we have seen recently is part of the process of solidifying a unique political system : a hereditary Communist monarchy .
