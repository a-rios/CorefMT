Getting Serious in Russia \ u0027s War on Terror 
Russia &apos;s decision to spend an extra 157 billion rubles ( over $ 5 billion ) to fight terrorism is a more impressive response than all the Kremlin &apos;s recent tough talk , including President Vladimir Putin &apos;s demand that more power be centralized in his hands . 
Indeed , after the hostage crisis in the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow in 2002 , the same sort of harsh words flowed , but no extra money was spent . 
These new billions do seem to demonstrate renewed government resolve , but is throwing money at the war on terror enough ? 
The Kremlin refuses to publicly admit that today &apos;s terrorism has its roots predominantly in the Chechen war , which is now metastasizing throughout the Northern Caucasus . 
Chechen fighters and their supporters demonstrate almost daily that the war continues , and countless bold pronouncements , like newly elected Chechen president Alu Alkhanov &apos;s recent assertion that &quot; effective measures &quot; have been found to combat terror , look like mere bloviation . 
According to Finance Minister Aleksei Kudrin , huge amounts of money are needed to resolve the Chechen problem . 
But financial inflows into Chechnya are often more destabilizing than helpful . 
President Akhmat Kadyrov , the murdered Chechen president , was right to suggest that 80 % of this money ends up in the pockets of Moscow and regional firms who benefit from the Chechen conflict continuing . 
So neither money nor military power alone can end the bloodshed , and diplomacy with the less militant Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov seems unlikely , for three reasons . 
First , contacts between Maskhadov and a few Russian politicians haven &apos;t - at least as of yet - influenced the Kremlin &apos;s position . 
Second , the subject for negotiations is unclear , because Putin has ruled out Chechen independence , and surrender by the separatists is just as unlikely . 
Third , even if negotiations with less militant Chechens occur and succeed , terrorism will continue under the leadership of the religious fanatic Shamil Basaev . 
The result of all this is spreading hopelessness . 
The thirst for vengeance after the Beslan school massacre makes confrontation between Chechens and Ingushis increasingly possible . 
Chechnya &apos;s neighboring republic , Dagestan , is witnessing increasing confrontations between radical and traditional Islamic groups , something now also seen in Kabardino-Balkaria . 
Unless the Russian state develops a viable policy , fast , all of these areas threaten to become safe havens for terrorists . 
What Russia needs is a political response to terror that takes into account its international dimension . 
In the last four years , radical Islam has established itself in the Northern Caucasus . 
This doesn &apos;t mean that all local Muslims have become jihadis . 
In fact , the latter are a tiny minority . 
But they are energetic , mobilized , and experienced fighters . 
These people increasingly identify themselves with the global jihad , and have forged firm links with Muslim radicals in the Middle East , Southern Asia and Europe . 
Russia must now follow America &apos;s lead in how to fight terror . 
Since the attacks of September 2001 , the United States has managed to avoid further attacks on its land . 
True , the news coming from Iraq is horrible , but the US is fighting a full-blown war in Iraq ; it is not engaged in a counterterrorist operation . 
Russia &apos;s power structures , like those of America , must now be readied to conduct a very long struggle , entirely different from the old Soviet KGB way of suppressing dissent . 
Russia &apos;s security forces need to learn to be pro-active , because the terrorists consistently seek to perfect their deadly methods . 
The fight against terror turns on who will strike first ; so far , the terrorists have been faster and more professional than the Russian state . 
To conduct this struggle effectively , Russia must abandon two hoary stereotypes : that all terrorists are bandits , and that they somehow are acting under some Western intelligence supervision to weaken Russia . 
The base of world terrorism consists of daring fanatics who believe in a sacred , fiery destiny . 
Osama bin Laden doesn &apos;t work for money and wants to destroy the entire West , not weaken Russia in particular . 
But the greatest obstacle that must be confronted if Russia is to wage war on terror effectively is the rampant corruption in the security forces . 
It is well known , for example , that Basaev &apos;s fanatical killers paid off Russian militia to enter Budeonovsk in 1995 and kill hospital patients . 
Yet nothing has been done to root out this tool of terror . 
It is all too easy to reduce the fight against terrorism to tightening the political screws , to a strengthening of Putin &apos;s power , to restricting the movement of people within the country . 
But none of these measures will frighten extremists in the Northern Caucasus or their al Qaeda allies . 
The Kremlin must know this already . 
Even Putin &apos;s predictable presidential rhetoric reveals a desire to initiate a real fight against terrorism . 
But waging a serious war requires a serious reorganization of Russia &apos;s power structures , which will be very painful . 
Despite Putin &apos;s so far unsuccessful fight against terrorism , his popularity remains high , so he has the political capital to make tough internal reforms . 
But he must act now , for public support can be no substitute for resolute and effective action .
