A Time to Experiment 
CAMBRIDGE - The world economy enters 2009 with more uncertainty ( and anxiety ) than at any time in recent memory . 
Although the financial crisis appears to be contained in the United States and Europe , its full repercussions will not be clear for some time . 
The advanced countries are in for the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression . 
But how long and deep will this recession be , and how badly will it affect emerging and developing nations ? 
We don &apos;t have the answers to these questions , in part because the consequences will depend on what actions policymakers take . 
The right responses will ensure that the world economy can begin to recover by late 2009 . 
Poor policy choices , on the other hand , will at best delay recovery and at worst do permanent damage . 
Here is a list of things to watch for . 
Will the US response be &quot; bold &quot; enough ? 
Barack Obama has promised that it will be , echoing at least part of Franklin D. Roosevelt &apos;s famous call for &quot; bold , persistent experimentation &quot; at the height of the Great Depression in 1932 . 
Obama has a first-rate group of economists on his side , which ensures that he will not do anything silly . 
But America &apos;s circumstances are sufficiently exceptional that he will need advisers who are willing to try new , untested ideas - in other words , experimentation Ã  la FDR . 
In particular , he will need to go beyond Keynesian fiscal-stimulus policies to heal the deep wounds to economic confidence that lie at the root of the current crisis . 
So far , confidence-building measures have been limited to financial markets , through public guarantees , liquidity support , and capital injections . 
But workers who worry about being laid off are unlikely to go spend , regardless of how much money fiscal stimulus puts in their pockets . 
Just as banks are hoarding cash , households will try to preserve wealth by increasing their saving . 
So incentives targeted directly at preserving employment will have to be part of the solution . 
Will Europe get its act together ? 
This could have been Europe &apos;s moment . 
After all , the crisis originated in the US and left American policy focused on its domestic troubles , opening up room for global leadership by others . 
Instead , the crisis demonstrated the deep divisions within Europe - on everything from financial regulation to the requisite policy response . 
Germany has dragged its feet on fiscal stimulus , stymieing what should have been the second leg of a globally coordinated fiscal action plan . 
If Europe wants to pull its weight on the global stage , it will have to act with greater unity of purpose and shoulder a greater share of responsibility . 
Alas , the best that can be hoped for at this stage is that Europe will not undermine the global fiscal stimulus that even the International Monetary Fund , the guardian of fiscal orthodoxy , regards as absolutely essential . 
Will China hold together ? 
Even though a weak US response is the biggest risk on the economic side , what happens in China may well have deeper and more lasting consequences on the broader historical canvas . 
For China is a country of enormous hidden tensions and cleavages , and these may erupt into open conflict in difficult economic times . 
Experts on China differ on the rate of economic growth needed to create employment for the millions of Chinese who flock into the country &apos;s cities every year . 
This explains the almost continuous stream of measures that emanate from Beijing these days : increased public spending , monetary easing , pressure on state enterprises to expand activity , subsidies to exporters , partial convertibility of the remninbi to spur trade with neighboring countries , and so on . 
But will this do enough to stem the slowdown in an economy that has become hooked on external demand in recent years ? 
If social tensions rise , China &apos;s government is likely to respond with greater repression , which will bode ill both for its relations with the West and for its medium-term political stability . 
Experience shows that democracies hold the edge over authoritarian regimes when it comes to handling the fallout from crises . 
It was democratic India ( in 1991 ) and South Korea ( in 1997-1998 ) that turned around their economies quickly , while Pinochet &apos;s Chile ( in 1983 ) and Suharto &apos;s Indonesia ( in 1997-98 ) fell into deeper quagmires . 
Authoritarian regimes lack the institutions of conflict management that democracies provide . 
So tensions spill over into the streets and take the form of riots and protests . 
However the Chinese leadership responds , future generations may remember 2009 less for its global economic and financial crisis than for the momentous transformation that it caused in China . 
Will there be enough global economic cooperation ? 
When domestic needs become paramount , global economic cooperation suffers . 
But the costs of protectionism in trade and finance are especially large at moments like these . 
The Great Depression was aggravated by the trade barriers that countries imposed to protect domestic employment . 
This will be a temptation this time around as well . 
And banks - whether explicitly nationalized or not - will be under pressure to prioritize domestic borrowers . 
So far , the IMF has reacted with newfound vigor , establishing a much-needed short-term lending facility , which may well need to be expanded if emerging markets come under greater pressure . 
The World Trade Organization , meanwhile , has wasted valuable time on the irrelevant Doha round . 
It should have focused its efforts on monitoring and implementing the G-20 &quot; s commitment not to raise trade barriers . 
Policymakers need to shed received wisdom and forget useless dichotomies such as &quot; markets versus government &quot; or &quot; nation-state versus globalization . &quot; 
They need to come to grips with the reality that national regulations and international markets are inextricably linked with - and in need of - each other . 
The more pragmatically and creatively they act , the more quickly the world economy will recover .
