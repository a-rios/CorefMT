India &apos;s Frugal Dynamism 
NEW DELHI - India &apos;s sliding economy has inspired gloom and doom far and wide , but increasingly bearish sentiment is misplaced . 
India still offers hope , but , to understand why , you have to leave macroeconomic indicators aside and go micro . 
To take one example : Google the phrase &quot; frugal innovation , &quot; and the first 20 search results all relate to India . 
Indian companies have long recognized the opportunities in meeting previously overlooked demand at the &quot; bottom of the pyramid . &quot; 
Shampoo sachets originated in India more than two decades ago , creating a market for a product that the poor had never before been able to afford . 
Indians without the space or money to buy a whole bottle of shampoo for 100 rupees could spend five for a sachet that they &apos;d use once or twice . 
But India &apos;s leadership in &quot; frugal innovation &quot; goes beyond downsizing : it involves starting with the needs of poor consumers - itself a novel term ( who knew the poor could be consumers ? ) - and working backwards . 
Instead of complicating or refining their products , Indian innovators strip them down to their bare essentials , making them affordable , accessible , durable , and effective . 
Indians are natural leaders in frugal innovation , imbued as they are with the jugaad system of developing makeshift but workable solutions from limited resources . 
Jugaad essentially conveys a way of life , a worldview that embodies the quality of making do with what you have to meet your needs . 
But jugaad is not about pirating products or making cheap imitations of global brands . 
It is about innovation - finding inexpensive solutions , often improvised on the fly , within the constraints of a resource-starved developing country full of poor people . 
An Indian villager constructs a makeshift vehicle to transport his livestock and goods by rigging a wooden cart with an irrigation hand pump that serves as an engine . 
That &apos;s jugaad . 
Common machines and household objects are reincarnated in ways that their original manufacturers never intended . 
Everything is reusable or reimaginable . 
If you cannot afford your mobile phone bills , you invent the concept of the &quot; missed call &quot; - a brief ring that is not answered but that signals your need to speak to the recipient . 
Indian ingenuity has produced a startling number of world-beating innovations , none more impressive than the Tata Nano , which , at $ 2,000 , costs roughly the same as a high-end DVD player in a Western luxury car . 
Of course , there &apos;s no DVD player in the Nano ( and no radio , either , in the basic model ) ; but its innovations ( which have garnered 34 patents ) are not merely the result of doing away with frills ( including power brakes , air conditioning , and side-view mirrors ) . 
Reducing the use of steel by inventing an aluminium engine ; increasing space by moving the wheels to the edge of the chassis ; and relying on a modular design that enables the car to be assembled from kits proved conclusively that you could do more with less . 
Then there &apos;s the GE MAC 400 , a hand-held electrocardiogram ( ECG ) device that costs $ 800 ( the cheapest alternative costs more than $ 2,000 ) , and the Tata Swachh , a $ 24 water purifier ( ten times cheaper than its nearest competitor ) . 
The GE MAC 400 uses just four buttons , rather than the usual dozen , and a tiny portable printer , making it small enough to fit into a satchel and even run on batteries ; it has reduced the cost of an ECG to just $ 1 per patient . 
The Swachh uses rice husks ( one of India &apos;s most common waste products ) to purify water . 
Given that some five million Indians die of cardiovascular diseases every year , more than a quarter of them under 65 , and that about two million die from drinking contaminated water , these innovations &quot; value is apparent . 
Many other examples of frugal innovation are already in the market , including a low-cost fuel-efficient mini-truck , an inexpensive mini-tractor being sold profitably in the United States , a battery-powered refrigerator , a $ 100 electricity inverter , and a $ 12 solar lamp . 
Moreover , medical innovations are widespread . 
An Indian company has invented a cheaper Hepatitis B vaccine , bringing down the price from $ 15 per injection to less than $ 0.10 . 
Insulin &apos;s price has fallen by 40 % , thanks to India &apos;s leading biotech firm . 
A Bangalore company &apos;s diagnostic tool to test for tuberculosis and infectious diseases costs $ 200 , compared to $ 10,000 for comparable equipment in the West . 
Late last year , India &apos;s government unveiled a handheld computer that will cost only 2,250 rupees ( about $ 40 ) . &quot; Aakash &quot; has a resistive seven-inch touch screen , like Apple &apos;s iPad . 
It comes in a rugged plastic casing , has two gigabytes of flash memory , two USB ports , headphone and video output jacks , and Wi-Fi capability . 
Aakash uses the Android 2.2 operating system and consumes a meager two watts of power , which is supplied by an internal lithium-ion battery that can be charged using a solar-powered charger . 
And the government will subsidize 50 % of the cost to students , so a young Indian just has to pay $ 20 to have his own tablet . 
The initial reviews are good . 
Even the financial sector has seen innovation . 
Just three years ago , there were only 15 million bank accounts in a country of 1.2 billion people . 
Indians concluded that if people won &apos;t come to the banks , the banks should go to the people . 
The result has been the creation of brigades of traveling tellers with hand-held devices , who have converted the living rooms of village homes into makeshift branches , taking deposits as low as a dollar . 
More than 50 million new bank accounts have been established , bringing India &apos;s rural poor into the modern financial system . 
Frugal innovation pervades the Indian economy . 
It is one of the reasons why there is more dynamism in the Indian economy than those who look only at the macroeconomic data believe . 
Sometimes it is important to stop looking at the forest and focus on the trees .
