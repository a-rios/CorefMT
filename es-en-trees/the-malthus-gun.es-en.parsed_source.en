The Malthus Gun 
WASHINGTON , DC - Science and technology changed agriculture profoundly in the twentieth century . 
Today , much of the developed world &apos;s agriculture is a large-scale enterprise : mechanized , computer-controlled , and based on sophisticated use of chemistry and knowledge of plant and soil physiology. amp # 160 ; 
The invention of chemical fertilizers early in the century and their increasing use , together with mechanization and the development of high-yielding grain varieties , propelled the growth of agricultural productivity in the developed world . The Green Revolution brought these benefits to less developed nations.amp # 160 ; 
As a result , despite a tripling of the global population , we have so far evaded Malthus &quot; 1798 prediction that human population growth would inevitably outstrip our ability to produce food . 
Over the second half of the twentieth century , the hungry of the Earth shrank from half of its three billion human inhabitants to less than a billion of the current 6.5 billion . 
Twentieth-century plant breeders learned to accelerate genetic changes in plants with chemicals and radiation - a rather shotgun approach to the genetic improvement of plants . 
The introduction of molecular methods began the current agricultural revolution . 
The use of such techniques is referred to as genetic modification ( GM ) , genetic engineering , or biotechnology . 
GM crops that resist certain pests and tolerate herbicides have gained rapid acceptance in many countries . 
According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications ( ISAAA ) , GM crop adoption is growing at double-digit rates , reaching 114.3 million hectares in 23 countries in 2007 . 
Perhaps most importantly , 11 of the 12 million GM farmers are resource-poor smallholders . 
In the 12 years since their commercial introduction , insect-resistant GM crops have increased yields while significantly decreasing the use of toxic pesticides . 
Herbicide-tolerant plants have decreased herbicide use and encouraged the widespread adoption of no-till farming , markedly reducing topsoil loss and promoting soil fertility . 
Despite dire predictions , no adverse effects of GM crops on health , biodiversity , and the environment have been documented to date . 
The only unanticipated effects so far have been beneficial . 
Insect-resistant GM corn , for example , shows much lower levels of mycotoxin contamination than conventionally or organically grown corn because the plants are resistant to the insect larvae that bore holes through which fungi enter plants . 
No holes , no fungi , no mycotoxins . 
What would we do today in the face of the growing world-wide diabetes epidemic without human insulin , now produced on a very large scale from human insulin genes expressed in microorganisms ? 
But the use of molecular techniques to improve crop plants continues to be rejected emphatically by many countries in Europe , by Japan , and - most tragically - by many African countries . 
Recent food and energy price shocks have pulled the world up short . 
The so-called &quot; food crisis &quot; of 2008 was not really a crisis in the sense of a condition that can be resolved by the quick application of emergency measures . 
It has been developing for decades . 
A human population approaching seven billion is straining the limits of the planet &apos;s ecological support systems . 
Water and arable land are in short supply . 
The climate is changing . 
Fossil fuel energy is expensive and contributes to climate change . 
Unexpectedly , we find ourselves once again staring down the barrel of Malthus &quot; gun . 
Most of the world &apos;s poorest people are rural , small-holding farmers , virtually untouched by modern agriculture . 
There is much room for increasing productivity . 
It seems that somewhere between the Green Revolution and the biotechnology revolution , the developed world declared the battle for food security won and moved on . 
Citizens of many urbanized , developed countries have grown nostalgic , increasingly convinced that organic farming , a throwback to nineteenth-century agriculture , produces nutritionally superior food ( it doesn &apos;t ) and can solve the world &apos;s food problems ( it can &apos;t ) . 
Where land is not yet limited , small-scale organic farming is an affordable luxury . 
The amount of arable land on the planet has not changed substantially in more than half a century . 
Land is lost to urbanization , desertification , and salinization as fast as it is added by clearing forests and plowing grasslands.amp # 160 ; 
Yet the human population &apos;s growth and increasing affluence continue to push up demand for food , feed , and fiber . 
Now , as we begin to confront the inevitable exhaustion of fossil fuel supplies , we are asking agriculture to satisfy some of our energy appetite , as well . 
This is like expecting your modest annual salary to satisfy all the appetites you developed while burning through a large inheritance . 
Adapting to climate change and decreasing agriculture &apos;s environmental impact , while substantially increasing its productivity , are among the key challenges confronting us in the twenty-first century . 
Despite the bad rap they &apos;ve gotten , the GM crops in use today have already contributed to meeting both challenges . 
Developing an environmentally friendly agriculture for a hot and crowded planet will require the most advanced agricultural methods available , including GM techniques . 
Indeed , there are projects underway to develop crop varieties that use less water and maintain their yield potential under harsher drought conditions than today &apos;s crops.amp # 160 ; 
Will we have the wisdom to accept the growing evidence of safety and welcome these necessary survival tools ?
