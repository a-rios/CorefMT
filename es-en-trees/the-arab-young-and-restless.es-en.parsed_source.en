The Arab Young and Restless 
NEW YORK - Many factors underlay the ongoing upheavals in the Middle East : decades of corrupt and authoritarian rule , increasingly literate and digitally-connected societies , and skyrocketing world food prices . 
To top it off , throughout the Middle East ( as well as Sub-Saharan Africa and most of South Asia ) , rapid population growth is fueling enormous demographic pressures . 
Egypt &apos;s population , for example , more than doubled over the course of Hosni Mubarak &apos;s rule , from 42 million in 1980 to 85 million in 2010 . 
This surge is all the more remarkable given that Egypt is a desert country , its inhabitants packed along the Nile . 
With no room to spread out , population densities are rising to the breaking point . 
Cairo has become a sprawling region of some 20 million people living cheek-by-jowl with inadequate infrastructure . 
Rapid population growth means a bulging youth population . 
Indeed , half of Egypt &apos;s population is under age 25 . 
Egypt , like dozens of countries around the world , is facing the extreme - and largely unmet - challenge of ensuring productive and gainful employment for its young people . 
Employment growth is simply not keeping up with this population surge , at least not in the sense of decent jobs with decent wages . 
The unemployment rate for young people ( 15-24 years old ) in North Africa and the Middle East is 30 % or more . 
The frustration of unemployed and under-employed youth is now spilling over into the streets . 
The problem of high youth unemployment is certainly not confined to the developing world , however . 
In the United States , the overall unemployment rate is around 9 % , but among 18-25 year olds , it is a staggering 19 % . 
And this includes only young people actually at work or looking for work . 
Many more have simply become discouraged and dropped out of the labor force entirely : not at school , not at work , and not looking for work . 
They don &apos;t protest much , but many end up in prison . 
The world &apos;s labor markets are now interconnected . 
Young people in countries as diverse as Egypt and the US are in effect competing with young Chinese and Indians for jobs . 
China &apos;s low-paid , reasonably productive manufacturing workers and high-quality infrastructure ( roads , power , ports , and communications ) has set the standard for competitiveness globally . 
As a result , low-skilled workers in Egypt , the US , and other countries must either raise their productivity enough to compete at a decent wage , or accept extremely low pay or outright unemployment . 
So creating decent jobs at decent wages is at the heart of being internationally competitive . 
That requires equipping workers with a good education , strong on-the-job training , and supportive infrastructure . 
While the private sector must create most of the jobs , the public sector must create the underlying conditions for high productivity . 
That is a tall order . 
Only one high-income region has done a reasonably good job of preparing its youth , and its overall economy , for tough global competition : Northern Europe , including Germany and Scandinavia ( Denmark , Finland , Norway , and Sweden ) . 
In these countries , public education is excellent , and the transition from school to work often involves programs like the apprenticeships for which Germany is especially famous . 
In developing countries , the main advances are found in countries that emphasize excellence in education , public investment in infrastructure , and serious on-the-job training . 
South Korea is probably the leading success story , with superb educational attainment and strong employment of young people having taken it from developing-country to high-income status within one generation . 
And South Korea has accomplished this feat in China &apos;s intensely competitive immediate neighborhood . 
The US , by contrast , is a case of failure , except for youth from high-income households . 
American children raised in affluence succeed in obtaining an excellent education and have good job prospects after a bachelor &apos;s degree . 
But , as the rich have successfully pressed for tax cuts and reductions in government spending , children from poor and working-class households are far less likely to receive a high-quality education , and the US government has failed to provide for training or adequate infrastructure . 
The result is a growing youth unemployment crisis among poor and working-class youth . 
The countries of North Africa and the Middle East should learn from East Asia and Northern Europe , and take pains to avoid the failures of the US . 
If democracy is to take hold and flourish in Egypt , Tunisia , and elsewhere in the Arab world , the new reform-minded governments must make the youth unemployment crisis their highest priority . 
Middle Eastern countries should elaborate strategies to improve the quality and increase the length of schooling , invest in job training , establish private-sector apprenticeships , and develop small and medium-sized businesses . 
They should identify key infrastructure projects needed to ensure private-sector productivity . 
And they must work together to deepen regional trade integration , thereby creating a much larger market . 
The deposed authoritarian rulers - Tunisia &apos;s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , Mubarak , and soon Libya &apos;s Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi - stashed away billions of dollars stolen from the public treasury . 
This ill-gotten money should be recovered and put into a special fund for youth employment . 
Moreover , with oil prices back above $ 100 per barrel , the Gulf states are enjoying a bonanza . 
They , too , should create a special fund for youth employment in the region through the Islamic Development Bank . 
There can be no better way to use the region &apos;s resources than to ensure that its young people &apos;s lives are enriched by education , skills , and high-quality jobs .
