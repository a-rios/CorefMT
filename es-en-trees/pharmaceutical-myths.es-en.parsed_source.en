Pharmaceutical Myths 
Drug companies want us to believe that soaring prices for prescription drugs are necessary to cover their research and development ( R &amp; D ) costs - a claim that implies that they spend most of their money on R &amp; D , and that after they pay for it , they have only modest profits left over . 
Curtailing prices , they say , would choke off R &amp; D and stifle innovation . 
But the real story is very different . 
Big drug companies actually spend relatively little on R &amp; D - far less than they spend on marketing and administration and even less than what they have left over in profits . 
In 2002 , for example , the top ten American drug companies had sales of $ 217 billion . 
According to their own figures , they spent 14 % of sales revenues on R &amp; D. But they spent over twice as much , a whopping 31 % , on marketing and administration . 
And they had 17 % left over as profits . 
Most drug companies lump marketing and administration together in their annual reports , but one reported that 85 % of the total went to marketing . 
Assuming that the figure is roughly the same for the other big companies - and there &apos;s reason to think that it is - then they spent nearly twice as much on marketing alone as they did on R &amp; D. 
In its public pronouncements , the industry denies this by counting just four specific activities as marketing - sales visits to doctors , the value of free samples , direct-to-consumer advertisements , and advertisements in medical journals . 
But , in fact , marketing budgets cover a lot more than this , most importantly the &quot; education &quot; of doctors ( which teaches them to prescribe more drugs ) . 
And what about profits ? 
For many years , drug companies in the United States have had higher profits than any other industry - after they &apos;ve paid for R &amp; D and all their other expenses . 
Compare the 17 % profit margin for the top ten American drug companies in 2002 with the median of only 3.1 % for all of America &apos;s &quot; Fortune 500 &quot; industries that year . 
In 2003 , for the first time , the industry fell slightly from first place to third in terms of profitability , but its profits were still well above the median . 
The recent claim that drug companies spend on average $ 802 million to bring each new drug to market is based on secret , proprietary data and is wildly inflated . 
But , whatever they spend on R &amp; D , if drug companies spend more on marketing and have more left over as profits , they can hardly claim that high prices are necessary to cover their R &amp; D. Instead , high prices are necessary to cover their stupendous marketing expenditures and maintain their enormous profits . 
There is now some pushback on prices , but drug companies are compensating by convincing more people to take more drugs for dubious or exaggerated ailments , thereby increasing volume . 
The important issue is not how much drug companies spend on R &amp; D , but whether we consumers get our money &apos;s worth . 
Remarkable as it seems , only a small fraction of drugs are innovative in any meaningful sense of the word . 
In the six years from 1998 to 2003 , of the 487 drugs that entered the market , fully 78 % were classified by the US Food and Drug Administration as likely to be no better than drugs already on the market . 
Moreover , 68 % were not even new chemical compounds , but just old drugs in new forms or combinations . 
In other words , the major output of the industry is not important new drugs , but minor variations of drugs that are already on the market - called copycat or &quot; me-too &quot; drugs . 
For example , the top-selling drug in the world , Pfizer &apos;s Lipitor , is the fourth of six cholesterol-lowering drugs of the same type . 
There are now whole families of me-too drugs , and little reason to think one is better than another at comparable doses . 
Far from being a model of free enterprise , the pharmaceutical industry is utterly dependent on government-funded research and government-granted monopolies in the form of patents and exclusive marketing rights . 
The few innovative drugs usually stem from publicly funded research done at government or university labs . 
Even among related me-too drugs , the original is usually based on government-sponsored work . 
For example , the first of the Lipitor-type drugs , Mevacor , came on the market in 1987 and was based largely on university research . 
Most of today &apos;s top-selling drugs have progenitors that date back to the 1980 &quot; s or even earlier . 
The bottom line is that , despite industry rhetoric , drug companies are growing less and less innovative . 
They &apos;re just re-jiggering the same old drugs , getting new patents and exclusivity , and relying on their marketing muscle to convince doctors and patients that they &apos;re producing medical miracles . 
Every advanced country regulates prescription drug prices in some way . 
Even in the US , Medicare regulates doctors &quot; fees and hospital payments . 
So we need not worry about stifling innovative R &amp; D. Drug companies do much less of it than they claim , and what they do they can easily afford .
