The Tuberculosis Front 
BERLIN - This has been a good decade in the fight against tuberculosis . 
We are likely to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of cutting TB prevalence and mortality in half by 2015 , from 1990 levels . 
At least a dozen new vaccines and drug candidates are in clinical trials , and the World Health Organization has endorsed a new diagnostic test called the GeneXpert . 
This progress is all the more important given the complacency that led to a complete standstill in research and development for new TB interventions toward the end of the twentieth century . 
The TB drugs currently in use were developed between 1950 and 1970 . 
Indeed , the Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin ( BCG ) vaccine is almost 100 years old , while the most widely used diagnostic test , microscopic detection of bacilli in sputum , was developed 130 years ago . 
No wonder that the efficacy of these tools has weakened . 
The current vaccine prevents severe TB in infants , but not the most prevalent pulmonary TB in all age groups . 
The microscopic test gives false results in nearly half of all cases . 
We like to think of TB as a malady of the past . 
In fact , nine million people develop the active disease every year , and one in five will die . 
One-third of the world &apos;s population is infected with the causative agent , though only one in ten develops the active disease . 
The bad news is that infected individuals carry the agent with them for their entire lives . 
When one &apos;s immune system weakens , the disease may erupt . 
With the emergence in the 1980 &quot; s of HIV , which compromises the immune system , TB reemerged , and is the number-one killer of HIV-infected individuals . 
Roughly 15 million people suffer from co-infection of HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the primary causative agent in most TB cases . 
Moreover , the tubercle bacillus engages in trench warfare , gaining resistance to conventional antibiotics and canonical vaccination approaches , as well as delaying diagnosis and determination of drug sensitivity . 
Whereas pandemics appear suddenly , spread rapidly , and raise enormous fears of an impending threat , TB has been spreading slowly but consistently for tens of thousands of years , patiently waiting for new opportunities . 
Treatment of TB requires a minimum of three drugs administered over at least six months . 
Compare this with antibiotic treatment of , say , a urogenital infection , which lasts a few weeks at most . 
As a result , compliance with TB drug treatment is particularly weak , paving the way for the emergence of multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) TB , which can no longer be treated by conventional therapeutic regimes . 
Some 50 million people are infected with tubercle bacilli that are MDR . 
While treating MDR-TB remains possible , doing so is arduous , with a treatment time of roughly two years , using drugs that are neither as efficient nor as benign as canonical drugs - and at a cost that rises by a factor of 10-100 . 
While this additional cost can be borne by health-care systems in the rich world , it is excessive for poor countries , implying no , or insufficient , treatment . 
Moreover , in 85 countries , extensively drug-resistant ( XDR ) TB , which is virtually untreatable , has been diagnosed . 
Indeed , surgical resection of affected lungs has become the treatment of choice in many XDR-TB hotspots . 
Welcome back to the pre-antibiotic era ! 
So , the question is not whether we need novel drugs , vaccines , and diagnostics , but when they will become available . 
The new GeneXpert test diagnoses not only TB , but also , in the same step , MDR-TB , which means that it can rapidly direct adequate treatment and prevent infection of contacts - a true breakthrough . 
Unfortunately , the test is expensive and sophisticated , putting it out of reach for many poor countries . 
A number of other drugs - some new and some repurposed - are currently in the last stage of clinical trials , and one new drug has been approved by US regulators for treatment of MDR-TB even before such trials have been completed . 
But the first potential vaccine to be tested for efficacy recently failed miserably . 
So , the good news of the last decade is just a glimmer of hope . 
Unfortunately , private-sector incentives for developing new TB interventions are too weak . 
New approaches , such as partnerships between public research institutions and private industry , are needed . 
While clinical trials of the most promising drugs and vaccines need to be pursued , we also need to go back to the drawing board and develop entirely new tactics . 
Current annual funding for R &amp; D devoted to TB is estimated to be $ 500 million . 
That amount may seem unrealistically high , but it is a negligible proportion of the estimated $ 160 billion spent on health-related R &amp; D worldwide . 
More important , the economic burden of TB has been put as high as $ 20 billion annually - and even higher if the losses in human capital are included . 
If we choose to continue suffering these losses , we might save some money in the short term . 
The wiser course , however , is to make the necessary investments today , thereby averting a much larger bill tomorrow .
