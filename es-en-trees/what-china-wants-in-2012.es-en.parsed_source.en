What China Wants in 2012 
BEIJING - With economic globalization and the advent of a multi-polar world , China and other emerging countries are clearly set to play much more important roles not only in 2012 , but in the coming decades . 
As China &apos;s economic power and influence in the world economy have increased following the financial crisis of 2008 , the idea has been floated that China and the United States should co-lead the world under some sort of &quot; G-2 &quot; arrangement . 
But such a G-2 framework is not consistent with China &apos;s independent foreign policy , nor with the general trend towards wider dispersion of geopolitical power within the international community . 
Although China &apos;s senior leadership will change this year , this position will not change . 
Indeed , when China &apos;s Premier Wen Jiabao visited Prague in May 2009 for the 11th China-European Union summit , he explained that China is opposed to the G-2 concept . 
It is China &apos;s firm intention never to seek hegemony , nor to support global domination by a small minority of countries . 
What China does believe in is deepening cooperation with all of the world &apos;s major regions . 
Consider Europe - a splendid and time-honored civilization , and now a major player on the world stage . 
The progressive deepening of EU integration has brought dynamic vigor to the European continent ; despite Europe &apos;s current difficulties , it still boasts extraordinary overall strength and international influence . 
China has always supported European integration , and hopes that the EU will become a pillar of international order . 
In the wake of the global financial crisis and the eurozone &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis , China has bought government bonds , made direct investments , and sent business delegations to Europe . 
During Spanish Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Zapatero &apos;s visit to Beijing in April 2011 , Wen reaffirmed China &apos;s willingness to continue purchasing Spanish government bonds as a further demonstration of our support for Europe &apos;s efforts to emerge from its crisis . 
Moreover , China &apos;s huge market and labor pool have created important opportunities for Europe . 
In this new multi-polar era , China and Europe must work together , and they are now at a critical moment if they are to deepen their cooperation . 
What we do to share opportunities , meet challenges , and pursue development will be directly relevant not only to our own peoples &quot; welfare , but also to the world &apos;s future . 
China-EU cooperation will be essential to maintaining global peace and stability . 
We share a commitment to resolving international issues through political means , and both sides have already played a constructive role in addressing global challenges such as climate change , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . 
The parallel launch of China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan and Europe &apos;s 2020 Strategy has also helped to deepen our cooperation . 
China and Europe worked together after 2008 to prevent a global financial meltdown , oppose protectionism , and promote reform of the international financial system , thus facilitating worldwide economic recovery . 
China also takes its relations with the US very seriously . 
That relationship has gone through some rough patches since diplomatic ties were established in 1979 , but , overall , it has continued to grow and benefit both sides . 
Today , China and the US share more interests than ever , and there are encouraging prospects for still broader cooperation . 
When President Hu Jintao visited Washington , DC in January 2011 , he and President Barack Obama agreed to build what Hu referred to as &quot; a China-US cooperative partnership based on respect and mutual benefit . &quot; 
They reaffirmed their deference for each other &apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity , and reached agreements on major strategic issues , including efforts to strengthen cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and in multilateral institutions , and to respond jointly to regional and global challenges to peace and stability , for example , on the Korean Peninsula . 
China is the world &apos;s largest developing country ; 
Europe is the largest bloc of developed countries ; and the US is the largest single developed country . 
Together , we account for nearly a third of humanity and two-thirds of the world economy . 
As the three major global powers , China , the EU , and the US must strengthen their cooperation , and must work with the rest of the world to face the complex international issues that challenge us all . 
Together , we must shoulder the great task of upholding world peace and promoting common development . 
While China is committed to its own independent foreign policy , it cannot achieve development in isolation . 
Likewise , the world cannot develop without China . 
Hu once said that the twenty-first century should be a century of peace , development , and cooperation . 
China is willing to join with the EU , the US , and the rest of the world to realize the potential of a truly harmonious world .
