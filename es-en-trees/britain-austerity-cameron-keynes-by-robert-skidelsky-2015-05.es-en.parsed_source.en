No Pain , No Gain for Britain ? 
LONDON - The economic historian Niall Ferguson reminds me of the late Oxford historian A.J.P. Taylor . 
Though Taylor maintained that he tried to tell the truth in his historical writing , he was quite ready to spin the facts for a good cause . 
Ferguson , too , is a wonderful historian - but equally ready to spin when he shifts into political gear . 
Ferguson &apos;s cause is American neo-conservatism , coupled with a relentless aversion to Keynes and Keynesians . 
His latest defense of fiscal austerity came immediately after the United Kingdom &apos;s recent election , when he wrote in the Financial Times that , &quot; Labour should blame Keynes for their defeat . &quot; 
Ferguson &apos;s argument amounts to that of a brutal disciplinarian who claims vindication for his methods by pointing out that the victim is still alive . 
In pleading on behalf of British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne , he points out that the UK economy grew by 2.6 % last year ( the &quot; best performing of the G-7 economies &quot; ) , but ignores the damage that Osborne inflicted on the economy en route to this recovery . 
There is now much agreement about this damage . 
The Office of Budget Responsibility , the independent agency set up by Osborne to assess the government &apos;s macroeconomic performance , has just concluded that austerity reduced GDP growth by 2 % from 2010 to 2012 , bringing the cumulative cost of austerity since 2010 to 5 % of GDP . 
Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University estimates that the damage might be as high as 15 % of GDP . 
In a recent poll of British economists by the Centre for Macroeconomics , two-thirds agreed that austerity had harmed the UK economy . 
Moreover , Britain is not alone . 
In its October 2012 World Economic Outlook , the IMF admitted that , &quot; fiscal multipliers were underestimated across the world . &quot; 
In plain English : the forecasters underestimated the extent of spare capacity and hence the scope for fiscal expansion to raise output . 
Was it an honest mistake ? 
Or was it because the forecasters were in thrall to economic models that implied that economies were at full employment , in which case the only result of fiscal expansion would be inflation ? 
They now know better , and Ferguson should now know better as well . 
A depressing aspect of Ferguson &apos;s interpretation is his failure to acknowledge the impact of the Great Recession on government performance and business expectations . 
Thus , he compares 2.6 % growth in 2014 with the 4.3 % contraction in 2009 , which he describes as &quot; the last full year of Labour government &quot; - as though Labour policy produced the collapse in growth . 
Similarly , &quot; At no point after May 2010 did &#91; confidence &#93; sink back to where it had been throughout the last two years of Gordon Brown &apos;s catastrophic premiership &quot; - as though the Brown government &apos;s performance caused business confidence to collapse . 
The claim that &quot; Keynes is to blame &quot; for Labour &apos;s election defeat is peculiarly odd . 
After all , the one thing Labour &apos;s leadership tried hardest to do in the campaign was to distance the party from any &quot; taint &quot; of Keynesianism . 
Perhaps Ferguson meant that it was Labour &apos;s past association with Keynes that had damned them - &quot; their disastrous stewardship before and during the financial crisis , &quot; as he puts it . 
In fact , Labour &apos;s most recent governments were determinedly non-Keynesian ; monetary policy was geared to hitting a 2 % inflation target , and fiscal policy aimed at balancing the budget over the business cycle : standard macro-economic fare before the recession struck . 
The most damning charge against their stewardship is that they embraced the idea that financial markets are optimally self-regulating - a view that Keynes rejected . 
Keynes was not to blame for Labour &apos;s defeat ; in large part , Scotland was . 
The Scottish National Party &apos;s crushing victory left Labour with only one seat in the country . 
There are no doubt many reasons for the SNP &apos;s overwhelming triumph , but support for austerity is not one of them . 
( The Conservatives did as badly as Labour . ) 
Nicola Sturgeon , First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP , attacked the &quot; cozy consensus &quot; around fiscal consolidation in Westminster . 
The deficit , she rightly said , was &quot; a symptom of economic difficulties , not just the cause of them . &quot; 
The SNP manifesto promised &quot; at least an additional Â£ 140 billion ( $ 220 billion ) across the UK to invest in skills and infrastructure . &quot; 
So if the SNP did so well with a &quot; Keynesian &quot; program of fiscal expansion , is it not arguable that Labour would have done better had it mounted a more vigorous defense of its own record in office and a more aggressive attack on Osborne &apos;s austerity policy ? 
This is what leaders of the Labour party like Alistair Darling , Gordon Brown &apos;s Chancellor of the Exchequer , are now saying . 
But they seem to have had no influence on the two architects of Labour &apos;s election strategy , Ed Miliband and Ed Balls , both now removed from front-line politics . 
What the Conservatives did succeed in doing , and doing brilliantly , was to persuade English people that they were only &quot; cleaning up Labour &apos;s mess , &quot; and that , but for austerity , Britain would have &quot; gone the way of Greece &quot; - exactly Ferguson &apos;s view . 
One might conclude that all of this is history : the voters have spoken . 
But it would be a mistake to accept the Conservative narrative as the last word . 
It is basically a tissue of propaganda , with little support in theory and destructive effects in practice . 
This might not matter so much had there been a change of government . 
But Osborne is back as Chancellor , promising even tougher cuts over the next five years . 
And fiscal austerity is still the reigning doctrine in the eurozone , thanks to Germany . 
So the damage is set to continue . 
In the absence of a compelling counter-narrative , we may be fated to find out just how much pain the victims can withstand .
