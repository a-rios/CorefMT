The High Cost of Ocean Decline 
SANTIAGO - The world &apos;s oceans are in trouble . 
In late September , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that the oceans are warming , seawater is acidifying , and oxygen concentrations are dropping . 
Last week , another initiative , the International Program on the State of the Ocean , outlined the toll that these and other factors , such as destructive fishing and pollution , are having on marine life . 
Ocean degradation is not as visible as deforestation , but it is at least as dangerous . 
The oceans provide at least half of the oxygen we breathe . 
Harm to the oceans can have a tremendous global impact . 
Degradation is particularly serious in the one substantial part of the world that is governed internationally - the high seas . 
These waters are outside maritime states &quot; exclusive economic zones ; they comprise two-thirds of the oceans &quot; area , covering fully 45 % of the earth &apos;s surface . 
The Global Ocean Commission , an independent initiative that I joined earlier this year , is reviewing the condition of the high seas . 
Next year , it will produce a set of recommendations concerning how to restore our oceans to full health and ecological productivity . 
One of the first tasks is to quantify the economic losses caused by ocean degradation . 
Back in 1997 , a pioneering paper by Robert Costanza and his colleagues put the overall value of marine ecosystem services at $ 21 trillion . 
Others have estimated that illegal fishing costs the global economy $ 10-23.5 billion per year , and poor management of fisheries $ 50 billion per year . 
But these figures are nearly a decade old ; the Commission will update these estimates and make them more precise . 
It is not enough to document that the losses are big . 
Obviously , the next question is what to do about it . 
No single official body has overall responsibility for the high seas . 
The basic pillar of ocean governance , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , was established 30 years ago . 
Since then , huge technological advances have occurred , and demand for resources has increased massively . 
So stopping and reversing the degradation of the world &apos;s oceans requires improved governance mechanisms , which must be used to enforce economically sensible and innovative solutions . 
Here the experience of countries fighting against deforestation is helpful . 
Costa Rica arguably started a trend in the early 1990 &quot; s , when it began levying taxes on fossil fuels and using the revenue to protect forests . 
The economy has benefited directly through a growth in tourism , and indirectly by preserving ecosystem services such as pollination . 
The concept of payment for ecosystem services is currently receiving attention from governments around the world . 
Costa Rica and Colombia have both signed up to a program funded by donor governments . 
Brazil has schemes that pay for protecting watercourses . 
An initiative called REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ) would pay for ecosystem services on a global scale by rewarding forest conservation , thereby regulating climate change . 
These ideas should receive more attention in the future , as our supplies of non-renewable resources dwindle . 
When the Global Ocean Commission issues its recommendations for reform next year , economics will be at their heart . 
Once we have more accurate data on the value of the ocean , we must decide how we use this information . 
Payment for ecosystem services could be a solution , though there are likely to be simpler options . 
But whichever mechanism is eventually adopted , we must also address the governance question : today &apos;s inadequate system allows both economic and ecological losses to persist . 
The Commission will share its recommendations with governments . 
There are tremendous costs associated with allowing the current laissez-faire regime to continue . 
We hope leaders understand that the world &apos;s oceans - and the ecosystem services they provide - are too important to be allowed to fail .
