Brazil Breaks Out 
The biggest hidden story in international development these days may be Brazil &apos;s economic takeoff . 
Two years ago , Brazil &apos;s economy was left for dead , and the election of Worker Party candidate Luiz Inácio &quot; Lula &quot; da Silva as President was widely expected to trigger financial collapse . 
Instead , Lula has governed with remarkable prudence , and Brazil is poised for rapid growth . 
But something more fundamental is at play : Brazil may finally be overcoming some of the deepest obstacles to its economic development , obstacles that held the country back for decades . 
If so , it could mark not only Brazil &apos;s economic ascendancy but also the recovery of other parts of South America . 
In January 2002 , American right-wingers were terrified of a leftist revolution in Brazil . 
Foreign investors were panicking over the prospect that Brazil would fail to roll over its foreign debts . 
The IMF , for a change , did a good job , providing interim financing and throwing its political backing behind Lula after the elections . 
In turn , Lula adopted orthodox macroeconomic policies and moved to get the budget deficit under control , breaking the panic . 
Market projections for Brazil &apos;s growth are around 4 % for 2004 . 
But something deeper is at play than the usual waves of euphoria and panic in international financial markets . 
Much of the credit for Brazil &apos;s turnaround belongs not to Lula but to his predecessor , Fernando Henrique Cardoso , who was Brazil &apos;s President from 1992 to 2000 . 
I credit FHC , as he is widely known , with making four key contributions . 
· First , under his leadership , Brazil firmly embraced human rights , not only in the sense of democratic elections , but in terms of economic justice for African-Brazilians and indigenous Brazilians , people who had long been discriminated against . 
Like most of Latin America , Brazil was born in the crucible of conquest and slavery . 
Even during the 20 th century , neither the indigenous populations nor the African-Brazilian slave descendants had much chance in the economic and social order . 
That is changing fast . 
Public education is becoming universally available , including for groups that faced harsh discrimination in the past . 
Remarkably , indigenous groups also won a hard-fought struggle for land rights in their traditional Amazon homelands . 
· Second , Brazil is finally embracing the global knowledge economy . 
For most of the 20 th century , Brazilian elites thought that they could get by on natural resources - cattle ranches , coffee plantations , fruit juices , and soybean farms . 
Now they know that universal secondary education and extensive university-level training is also needed . 
Under FHC &apos;s reforms , enrolment rates in secondary education soared , from 15 % in 1990 to 71 % in 2000 . 
Equally important , Brazilian universities are seeing an increase in quality and attendance as well . 
Most of Latin America , including Brazil , ignored public investments in R &amp; D for decades , while East Asian countries invested heavily . 
FHC appointed a series of outstanding Ministers of Science and Technology , and the government finally began spending more on research and development . 
Brazil is becoming known not only for orange juice , but for aircraft exports like the Embraer jets that now compete with American and European producers for the regional commuter market . 
· Third , Brazil is coming out of its economic shell , competing in world markets rather than protecting national markets . 
For decades , due to rampant protectionism , the ratio of Brazil &apos;s exports to GNP was one of the lowest in the world . 
That is finally changing . 
The export / GNP ratio has risen from 8 % in 1990 to 13 % in 2001 , a sign that Brazil is beginning to seek out world markets . 
Lula is traveling widely to promote Brazilian exports , another sure sign that Brazil &apos;s political economic orientation has become far more international . 
· Fourth , Brazil is focusing on the health and productivity of its people . 
Under FHC , Brazil pioneered an effective response to the AIDS epidemic by guaranteeing access to antiretroviral medicines and to widespread counseling and viral testing . 
The hero of this effort , Dr. Paulo Teixera , is now at the World Health Organization helping to lead the global effort against AIDS . 
Brazil has also dramatically improved child health , with mortality rates of young children falling sharply , from 60 per thousand in 1990 to 36 per thousand in 2001 . 
Brazil &apos;s total fertility rate ( average number of births per woman ) has come down sharply as well , from 2.7 in 1990 to 2.2 in 2001 . 
With more children surviving to adulthood , poor families are choosing to have fewer children , and to invest more in their health and education . 
Population growth pressures are falling , providing a powerful long-term boost to Brazil &apos;s economic development . 
Brazil &apos;s economic turnaround may have powerfully positive effects on its neighbors , especially the struggling countries of the Andean region . 
This is the most likely scenario , but it is too early to declare victory . 
Brazil still faces huge challenges . 
Lula will have to build on the work of FHC . 
Macroeconomic stability must be consolidated , with budget deficits brought decisively under control . 
The political consensus in favor of universal education , outward-oriented trade , health for all , and a science-and-technology oriented economy must be strengthened . 
Brazil must also pay more attention to environmental management , especially in the fragile yet critical Amazon region , if it wants long-term , sustainable economic development . 
For Brazil to play a bigger role as regional economic leader , greater cooperation with its neighbors in suitable infrastructure projects and expanded markets will be needed . 
Great challenges , indeed , but Brazil seems to be in the mood to meet them .
