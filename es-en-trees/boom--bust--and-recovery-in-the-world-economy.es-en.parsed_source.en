Boom , Bust , and Recovery in the World Economy 
NEW YORK - This global economic crisis will go down in history as Greenspan &apos;s Folly . 
This is a crisis made mainly by the United States Federal Reserve Board during the period of easy money and financial deregulation from the mid-1990 &quot; s until today . 
This easy-money policy , backed by regulators who failed to regulate , created unprecedented housing and consumer credit bubbles in the US and other countries , notably those that shared America &apos;s policy orientation . 
The bubble has now burst , and these economies are heading into a steep recession . 
At the core of the crisis was the run-up in housing and stock prices , which were way out of line with historical benchmarks . 
Greenspan stoked two bubbles - the Internet bubble of 1998-2001 and the subsequent housing bubble that is now bursting . 
In both cases , increases in asset values led US households to think that they had become vastly wealthier , tempting them into a massive increase in their borrowing and spending - for houses , automobiles , and other consumer durables . 
Financial markets were eager to lend to these households , in part because the credit markets were deregulated , which served as an invitation to reckless lending . 
Because of the boom in housing and stock market prices , US household net wealth increased by around $ 18 trillion during 1996-2006 . 
The rise in consumption based on this wealth in turn raised house prices further , convincing households and lenders to ratchet up the bubble another notch . 
This has all come crashing down . 
Housing prices peaked in 2006 , and equity prices peaked in 2007 . 
With the collapse of these bubbles , paper wealth of perhaps $ 10 trillion , or even as much as $ 15 trillion , will be wiped out . 
Several complex things are now happening simultaneously . 
First , households are cutting back sharply on consumption , since they feel - and are - vastly poorer than they were a year ago . 
Second , several highly leveraged institutions , such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers , have gone bankrupt , causing further losses of wealth ( of these failed institutions &quot; shareholders and creditors ) and a further loss of credit that these firms once supplied . 
Third , commercial banks also lost heavily in these dealings , wiping out much of their capital . 
As their capital declines , so , too , do their future loans . 
Fourth , and finally , the failure of Lehman Brothers and near failure of the insurance giant AIG , incited a financial panic , in which even healthy firms are unable to obtain short-term bank loans or sell short-term commercial paper . 
The challenge for policymakers is to restore enough confidence that companies can once again obtain short-term credit to meet their payrolls and finance their inventories . 
The next challenge will be to push for a restoration of bank capital , so that commercial banks can once again lend for longer-term investments . 
But these steps , urgent as they are , will not prevent a recession in the US and other countries hit by the crisis . 
The stock and housing markets are unlikely to recover any time soon . 
Households are poorer as a result , and will cut back sharply on their spending , making a recession inevitable in the short run . 
The US will be hardest hit , but other countries with recent housing and consumption booms ( and now busts ) - particularly the United Kingdom , Ireland , Australia , Canada , and Spain - will be hit as well . 
Iceland , which privatized and deregulated its banks a few years ago , now faces national bankruptcy , because its banks will not be able to pay off foreign creditors who lent heavily to them . 
It is no coincidence that , with the exception of Spain , all of these countries explicitly adhered to the US philosophy of &quot; free-market &quot; and under-regulated financial systems . 
But , whatever the pain felt in the deregulated Anglo-Saxon-style economies , none of this must inevitably cause a global calamity . 
I do not see any reason for a global depression , or even a global recession . 
Yes , the US will experience a decline in income and a sharp rise in unemployment , lowering the rest of the world &apos;s exports to the US . 
Many large economies , including China , Germany , Japan , and Saudi Arabia , have very large export surpluses , and so have been lending to the rest of the world ( especially to the US ) rather than borrowing . 
These countries are flush with cash , and are not burdened by the collapse of a housing bubble . 
Although their households have suffered to some extent from the fall in equity prices , they not only can continue to grow , but they can also increase their internal demand to offset the decline in exports to the US . 
They have enough foreign-exchange reserves to avoid the risk of financial instability from increasing their domestic spending , as long as they do it prudently . 
As for the US , the current undeniable pain for millions of people , which will grow next year as unemployment rises , is an opportunity to rethink the economic model adopted since President Ronald Reagan came to office in 1981 . 
Low taxes and deregulation produced a consumer binge that felt good while it lasted , but also produced vast income inequality , a large underclass , heavy foreign borrowing , neglect of the environment and infrastructure , and now a huge financial mess . 
The time has come for a new economic strategy - in essence a new New Deal .
