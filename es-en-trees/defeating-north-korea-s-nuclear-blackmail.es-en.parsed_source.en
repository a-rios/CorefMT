Defeating North Korea &apos;s Nuclear Blackmail 
North Korea &apos;s announcement that it possesses nuclear weapons has fuelled a diplomatic frenzy . 
To persuade North Korea to return to the six-party talks - with China , Japan , the US , Russia , and South Korea - on defusing the nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula , Japan , the US , and South Korea have now offered to expand the scope of the talks to allow North Korea to raise any issue that concerns it . 
This could be a grave mistake . 
The talks ground to a halt in June 2004 , when the North Koreans pulled out , citing the allegedly hostile policies of the US and Japanese governments . 
Now they claim to have manufactured nuclear weapons for self-defense . 
Although there had been several unofficial statements by Kim Jong-Il &apos;s regime admitting that North Korea possessions nuclear arsenal , the announcement was the first official confirmation . 
What lay behind the declaration was the regime &apos;s recognition that a second-term Bush administration would not soften its demand for a complete repudiation of its nuclear program , but would instead continue to pursue policies aimed at isolating and stifling North Korea . 
The same goes for Japan , whose stance on the abduction of its citizens by North Korean agents in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s was also cited by the Kim regime last June as a reason for walking out of the six-party talks . 
With this in mind , the North Koreans &quot; motives in playing the nuclear trump card are clear , and the timing couldn &apos;t have seemed more advantageous for them : force the Americans into making concessions while the situation in Iraq leaves the US with no room for maneuver , and undercut the rising call in Japan for economic sanctions against North Korea over the abduction issue . 
Thus , whereas North Korea &apos;s announcement of its nuclear capability strongly condemned Japan and the US , it did not mention China , Russia , and South Korea , which had been more conciliatory during the six-party talks . 
Indeed , in withdrawing from the six-party talks , North Korea did not completely abandon the possibility of resolving the nuclear standoff through dialogue . 
Rather , North Korea &apos;s aim was to postpone the six-party talks as long as possible in order to force direct bilateral negotiations with the US , in which it would presumably extract energy assistance and other aid while demanding a security guarantee for &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong-il . 
America didn &apos;t budge on bilateral negotiations , and its response to North Korea &apos;s recent announcement that it possesses nuclear weapons likewise emphasized the need to revive the six-party talks . 
Japan adopted a similar stance . 
Like Japan , the Bush administration &apos;s relatively moderate stance toward North Korea has changed since the talks broke down last year . 
The US seems to be tightening its diplomatic encirclement of North Korea with a view to shifting the nuclear discussion to the UN Security Council . 
Moreover , the Japan-US Security Consultative Committee brought together the countries &quot; foreign and defense ministers in Washington in February to discuss common strategic objectives related to the reformation of US forward forces . 
Remaining in step with each other on security issues is essential if Japan and the US are to maintain a firm alliance to ensure the stability of the Asia-Pacific region . 
The Japanese government has also been searching for effective measures to respond to North Korea &apos;s consistently insincere attitude on regional and bilateral issues , including the abduction cases . 
Militarily , Japan revised its law on the Self-Defense Forces to establish procedures for ballistic missile defense , with a strong focus on North Korea . 
The decision , coming at the cabinet &apos;s regular meeting on February 15th , was not intended to coincide with Kim Jong-il &apos;s 63rd birthday the following day . 
But it did show that Japan &apos;s government , having long suspected that North Korea already possessed nuclear weapons , would not be intimidated into a fundamental policy change by confirmation of the threat . 
The revision establishes the future direction of Japan &apos;s military posture by delegating greater authority to the commanders of the Self-Defense Forces to initiate defensive actions against immediate threats . 
According to South Korean news reports , in addition to its existing mid-range Nodong missiles , North Korea has improved its Scud missiles , extending their range to reach Japan &apos;s main islands . 
If North Korea is , indeed , continuing to develop not only its nuclear arsenal , but also various types of ballistic missiles , in defiance of international commitments , it is truly a rogue state . 
As for the nuclear issue , Japan &apos;s policy toward North Korea should continue to emphasize solidifying ties with the US and strengthening cooperation with China , South Korea , and Russia , making every effort to promote early resumption of the six-party talks . 
But dialogue with the Kim regime cannot be an end in itself . 
Negotiation is necessary , and it must be sufficient , but progress will be impossible if North Korea is allowed to turn its mere participation in the six-party talks into a bargaining chip .
