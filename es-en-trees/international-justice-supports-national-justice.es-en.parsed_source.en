International Justice Supports National Justice In recent years , an emerging international system of justice has begun to undermine the old calculus of tyrants and torturers . 
Recently they could commit their crimes with impunity , bludgeoning their nation &apos;s judicial system into submission . 
Now international war crimes tribunals have been created for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia , national courts have indicted despots from other countries , and a permanent International Criminal Court will soon be established . 
Yet international justice is attacked as elitist and undemocratic . 
Critics complain that home-grown national justice is being replaced by distant , unaccountable international tribunals . 
Decrying a new legal imperialism , they ask why foreign prosecutors should make critical decisions about justice concerning countries with which they have no personal connection . 
Recent experience , however , suggests that , far from supplanting national law enforcement , international justice is beginning to spur toward national prosecutions , reinforcing rather than replacing local efforts . 
The clearest case concerns former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet . 
This confidence lay in two legal gifts he had bestowed upon himself - an amnesty for his crimes and immunity as a senator-for-life . 
But once Pinochet was arrested in London , on charges filed by a Spanish judge , his carefully constructed edifice of impunity began to crumble . 
His arrest , and the House of Lords &apos; later approval of it , legitimized the idea of prosecuting the former dictator . 
Indeed , in an effort to secure Pinochet &apos;s return , Chilean officials vowed for the first time to prosecute him themselves . 
As a result , when Pinochet was returned to Chile sixteen months later , on medical grounds , he faced revived criminal charges filed by victims and survivors of his rule . 
The Chilean courts allowed these cases to proceed by stripping Pinochet of his parliamentary immunity and endorsing a legal theory to bypass the amnesty . 
Because of failing health , Pinochet may still escape punishment . 
But the effect of his case on international justice ensures that , at the very least , he will be remembered for his indictment in Chile rather than for the impunity he had sought to ensure . 
Another instance in which international justice has had a positive effect is in Chad . 
In February 2000 , at the request of victims , Senegal indicted and arrested Chad &apos;s former dictator Hissene Habre , who had taken refuge there . 
The fate of that prosecution in Senegal remains uncertain , but it revived the once moribund issue of justice in Chad . 
Last October , seventeen victims and survivors filed criminal complaints in Chad for murder , &quot; disappearance , &quot; and torture against one-time members of Habre &apos;s secret service . 
Chad &apos;s current president , Idriss Deby , recently met with victims for the first time and promised to support their cases . 
He also vowed to rid his administration of Habre &apos;s security agents and to grant access to the files of a truth commission that investigated Habre &apos;s rule . 
For example in Guatemala , where the findings of a UN truth commission has at last sparked a serious judicial investigation of former President Rios Montt for crimes against humanity committed during his scorched-earth attacks on perceived rural opponents in 1982-83 . 
An amendment to Argentina &apos;s Constitution giving international treaties constitutional force lay behind an Argentine court &apos;s historic decision this month , reversing amnesties adopted under military pressure in the 1980s for atrocities committed during the country &apos;s 1976-83 &quot; dirty war . &quot; 
The International Criminal Court - a tribunal with potential worldwide jurisdiction over genocide , war crimes , and crimes against humanity - is built on a comparable catalytic theory . 
It has jurisdiction only insofar as national governments fail to investigate and , if appropriate , prosecute a case in good faith . 
Of course , national justice does sometimes fail - for lack of will or capacity - and international justice must step in . 
In Indonesia , for example , the threat of international justice for the September 1999 rampage in East Timor led to the Indonesian government &apos;s publishing of a list of twenty-two suspects . 
But a year-and-a-half later , Indonesia &apos;s government has not prosecuted anyone . 
An international tribunal may be the only hope . 
Similarly , the war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia , based in The Hague , insists on the surrender of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and other indicted suspects . 
Milosevic &apos;s victims and survivors - mostly ethnic Bosnians , Albanians , and Croats - have little confidence that the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government , emerging from a decade of ethnic wars , will ever prosecute their cause in good faith . 
Nor has Belgrade given grounds for confidence . 
It speaks of prosecuting Milosevic for corruption or the murder of a few Serb political opponents , but not for mass atrocities committed against other ethnic groups . 
Its apparent willingness to prosecute Milosevic at all is largely due to the threat of international justice . 
But the half-hearted prosecution that it has been willing to contemplate so far highlights the need for an international tribunal . 
Donors should withhold all non-humanitarian aid to Belgrade until it surrenders Milosevic for trial in The Hague . 
Experience shows that international justice is less a threat to national justice than a backstop ; that it is less likely to replace national justice than bolster it . 
In any case , that developing partnership between national and international justice means that tyrants and torturers - past and future - can no longer blithely assume lifelong impunity .
