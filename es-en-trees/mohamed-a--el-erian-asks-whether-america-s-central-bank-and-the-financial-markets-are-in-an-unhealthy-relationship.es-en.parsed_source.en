Markets &quot; Federal Reserve Love Story 
LAGUNA BEACH - The morning drive to my 11-year old daughter &apos;s school is always fun , and often a source of insight . 
That was certainly the case last week when she pointed out something about Frozen , the hugely popular Disney film , that had totally escaped me . 
&quot; It &apos;s unusual , &quot; she said , &quot; to see a Disney movie in which they end up telling us not to marry someone we &apos;ve just met . &quot; 
Quite early on in the movie , Princess Anna meets Prince Hans at her sister Princess Elsa &apos;s coronation ball . 
They immediately connect on many levels and , yes , &quot; fall in love . &quot; 
He quickly proposes , and she accepts , but Elsa refuses to give her blessing . 
It then takes Anna most of the movie to figure out that Hans is evil - set on getting rid of both her and her older sister in order to take over the kingdom . 
Luckily for her , there is a wonderful commoner - Kristoff - whom she has gotten to know during the course of her adventures . 
After many decades of Disney movies , we have been conditioned to expect princesses to fall in love quickly with their charming princes and &quot; live happily ever after . &quot; 
And when there are challenges or obstacles ( mostly in the more recent movies ) , these are quickly overcome ( and with humor ) . 
Similarly , for many years market participants have been richly rewarded for falling in love - quickly and decisively - with the new policy measures adopted by America &apos;s Federal Reserve . 
Indeed , the romance has overwhelmingly followed the Disney script . 
Yes , there may have been some bumps along the way , but they have been overcome quickly . 
And the romance has resulted in both parties living happily : the Fed feels better positioned to pursue its dual mandate of high employment and stable inflation , while investors feel that they have the opportunity for sizeable financial rewards . 
This relationship has been so comfortable that market participants have adopted the mantra &quot; Never fight the Fed &quot; - and for good reason . 
The Fed is the world &apos;s most powerful central bank . 
It owns the printing press that produces the world &apos;s main reserve currency . 
It enjoys a significant amount of political independence . 
Market participants also know that the Fed needs them to leverage its policy influence and deliver on its mandate , which , in recent years , has rightly been broadened in practice to incorporate the goal of financial stability . 
To this end , the Fed has become much more &quot; transparent &quot; with markets in the last few years , sharing more readily the minutes and transcripts of its policy discussions . 
The Chair of the Federal Reserve Board has even taken to holding periodic press conferences that are closely watched on trading floors around the world . 
Since the 2008 global financial crisis , the romance has become particularly intense , especially as the Fed has been compelled to use a range of unconventional measures to overcome the capital-market disruptions that almost tipped the world economy into a deep depression . 
In doing so , the Fed has become more involved in how markets function , the valuation of assets , and fluctuations in their prices . 
Initially , central bankers were keen to cultivate this romance as a means of meeting their broader policy objectives of growth , employment , stable inflation , and financial stability . 
More recently , however , some have become less comfortable , warning that the codependence is encouraging excessive risk-taking and , in some cases , bubbly valuations . 
Some worry that it may even undermine the Fed &apos;s political independence . 
And , only two weeks ago , an outgoing Fed governor , Jeremy Stein , declared that the Fed is in the middle of a policy transition that renders its guidance to markets &quot; more qualitative , &quot; &quot; less deterministic &quot; and , therefore , less precise . 
Like Princess Anna in Frozen , it will take time for markets to recognize that their relationship with the Fed is changing ( and should change ) ; and , similar to the movie , some sort of shock may be involved in socializing the new understanding . 
Having said that , the outcome will certainly not be as dramatic as in the movie - if only because , unlike Hans , the Fed is not out to take over the markets . 
So the romance will survive , but it is unlikely to be as intense , and it is unlikely to be unconditional . 
The hope is that , by that time , a more vibrant real economy will perform the role that Kristoff played in the movie . 
The best and most sustainable love story for markets is one based on a healthy and dynamic real economy that creates jobs and opportunities for many more people . 
Unfortunately , on that count , it is too soon to predict whether we will live happily ever after .
