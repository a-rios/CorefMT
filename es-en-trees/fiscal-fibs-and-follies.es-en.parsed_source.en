Fiscal Fibs and Follies 
BERKELEY - Across the globe , the debate over fiscal consolidation has the distinct sound of two sides talking past one another . 
On one side are those who insist that governments must move now , at all cost , to rein in budget deficits . 
Putting public finances on a sustainable footing , they argue , is essential to reassure financial markets . 
If concerted efforts are taken to balance budgets , confidence will be bolstered . 
And if confidence is bolstered , consumption and investment will rise . 
In this view , cutting deficits will be expansionary . 
As evidence that this is not merely a hypothetical possibility , advocates of fiscal consolidation point to cases like Denmark in the early 1980 &quot; s , Ireland in the late 1980 &quot; s , and Finland in the 1990 &quot; s . 
On the other side are those who insist that additional public spending is still needed to support demand . 
Private spending remains weak , not least where continued high unemployment has led consumers , concerned about future prospects , to pocket their wallets . 
Moreover , the critics object , the evidence in support of expansionary fiscal consolidations is flawed . 
In each case where fiscal consolidation supposedly was expansionary , the economy grew because of some third factor . 
Denmark grew , despite fiscal cuts , because interest rates , initially in the double digits , came down . 
Ireland and Finland grew , despite fiscal cuts , because the exchange rate fell sharply , boosting exports . 
The world economy today , desperate for demand , can &apos;t count on either mechanism . 
Interest rates in many countries are already near zero . 
And all countries can &apos;t depreciate their exchange rates at the same time . 
So who is right ? 
Consider the following image : consumers and investors as passengers in a car hurtling directly toward a brick wall . 
In this case , the driver stepping on the brake will give the passengers more confidence . 
Here , the plausible passengers are southern European firms . 
They understand that their countries &quot; fiscal positions are unsustainable . 
They know that debt default would be disruptive . 
Seeing the economy hurtling toward a brick wall , they are holding their collective breath , while evidence that the government is serious about stepping on the brake can induce them to exhale . 
In this case , fiscal consolidation is likely to affect their investment spending positively . 
This does not mean that Greece , Portugal , and Spain will expand as robustly as Denmark , Ireland , and Finland did in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
They can &apos;t lower the exchange rate to aid exports . 
But they can reduce interest rates by eliminating the perceived risk of sovereign default . Banks will be able to borrow from one another for less , and thus able to lend to firms for less . 
This suggests that investment may respond better than the pessimists fear . 
But what might work in southern Europe has no chance of working elsewhere . 
In other G-20 economies , including the United States , Germany , China , and Japan , the car is still cruising down an open road . 
Fiscal velocity may be considerable - that is , deficits may be large - but there is no sign of a brick wall ahead . 
Interest rates on government debt are still low . 
If the passengers were growing restive , they would rise . 
At this point , they have not . 
In these countries , there is therefore no reason to think that fiscal consolidation would have a strong positive effect on confidence . 
That possibility could arise sometime in the future , when the proverbial brick wall comes into view . 
But it is not on the horizon yet , which means that there would be no positive private-spending response to buffer public-spending cuts . 
As a result , budget cuts would be strongly contractionary . 
Finally there are borderline cases , like Britain . 
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne insists that his country &apos;s fiscal trajectory is dangerously unsustainable , and he has proposed draconian cuts . 
Others strongly disagree , noting the continued low level of interest rates , and that even under the previous government &apos;s plan , net borrowing costs were already scheduled to fall by nearly two-thirds between 2010-11 and 2014-15 . 
It is almost as if governments like Britain &apos;s are attempting to manipulate the private sector into believing that the dire conditions required for an expansionary fiscal consolidation have already been met . 
It as if they are trying to terrorize the private sector , so that when the fiscal ax actually falls , consumers and investors will be sufficiently relieved that disaster has been averted that they will increase spending . 
If so , leaders are playing a dangerous game that depends on encouraging more future spending by exciting consumers and investors now , while depressing actual spending just when it is most urgently needed . 
Or maybe politicians don &apos;t believe any of this and are simply intent on cutting spending for ideological reasons , irrespective of the economic consequences . 
But who would be so cynical as to believe that ?
