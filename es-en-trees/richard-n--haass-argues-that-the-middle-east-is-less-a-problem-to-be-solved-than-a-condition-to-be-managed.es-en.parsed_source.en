The New Thirty Years &quot; War 
NEW YORK - It is a region wracked by religious struggle between competing traditions of the faith . 
Conflicts take place within and between states ; civil wars and proxy wars become impossible to distinguish . 
Governments often forfeit control to smaller groups - militias and the like - operating within and across borders . 
The loss of life is devastating , and millions are rendered homeless . 
That could be a description of today &apos;s Middle East . 
In fact , it describes Europe in the first half of the seventeenth century . 
In the Middle East in 2011 , change came after a humiliated Tunisian fruit vendor set himself alight in protest ; in a matter of weeks , the region was aflame . 
In seventeenth-century Europe , a local religious uprising by Bohemian Protestants against the Catholic Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand II triggered that era &apos;s conflagration . 
Protestants and Catholics alike turned for support to their co-religionists within the territories that would one day become Germany . 
Many of the era &apos;s major powers , including Spain , France , Sweden , and Austria , were drawn in . 
The result was the Thirty Years &quot; War , the most violent and destructive episode in European history until the two world wars of the twentieth century . 
There are obvious differences between the events of 1618-1648 in Europe and those of 2011-2014 in the Middle East . 
Three and a half years after the dawn of the &quot; Arab Spring , &quot; there is a real possibility that we are witnessing the early phase of a prolonged , costly , and deadly struggle ; as bad as things are , they could well become worse . 
The region is ripe for unrest . 
Most of its people are politically impotent and poor in terms of both wealth and prospects . 
Islam never experienced something akin to the Reformation in Europe ; the lines between the sacred and the secular are unclear and contested . 
Moreover , national identities often compete with - and are increasingly overwhelmed by - those stemming from religion , sect , and tribe . 
Civil society is weak . 
In some countries , the presence of oil and gas discourages the emergence of a diversified economy and , with it , a middle class . 
Education emphasizes rote learning over critical thinking . 
In many cases , authoritarian rulers lack legitimacy . 
Outside actors , by what they did and failed to do , added fuel to the fire . 
The 2003 Iraq war was highly consequential , for it exacerbated Sunni-Shia tensions in one of the region &apos;s most important countries and , as a result , in many of the region &apos;s other divided societies . 
Regime change in Libya has created a failing state ; lukewarm support for regime change in Syria has set the stage for prolonged civil war . 
The region &apos;s trajectory is worrisome : weak states unable to police their territory ; the few relatively strong states competing for primacy ; militias and terrorist groups gaining greater influence ; and the erasure of borders . 
The local political culture confuses democracy with majoritarianism , with elections used as vehicles to consolidate power , not share it . 
Beyond the enormous human suffering and loss of life , the most immediate byproduct of the region &apos;s turmoil is the potential for more severe and frequent terrorism - both in the Middle East and emanating from it . 
There is also the potential for disruption of energy production and shipping . 
There are limits to what outsiders can do . 
Sometimes , policymakers need to focus on preventing things from getting worse , rather than on ambitious agendas for improvement ; this is one of those times . 
What this calls for , above all , is prevention of nuclear proliferation ( beginning with Iran ) , whether through diplomacy and sanctions , or , if need be , through sabotage and military attacks . 
The alternative - a Middle East in which several governments and , through them , militias and terrorist groups have access to nuclear weapons and materials - is too horrific to contemplate . 
Steps that reduce global dependence on the region &apos;s energy supplies ( including improvements in fuel efficiency and development of alternative sources ) also make great sense . 
Economic assistance should go simultaneously to Jordan and Lebanon to help them cope with the flood of refugees . 
Democracy promotion in Turkey and Egypt should focus on strengthening civil society and creating robust constitutions that diffuse power . 
Counter-terrorism against groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( which now calls itself simply the &quot; Islamic State &quot; ) - whether by drones , small raids , or the training and arming of local partners - must become a staple of policy . 
It is time to recognize the inevitability of Iraq &apos;s break-up ( the country is now more a vehicle for Iran &apos;s influence than a bulwark against it ) and bolster an independent Kurdistan within Iraq &apos;s former borders . 
There is no room for illusions . 
Regime change is no panacea ; it can be difficult to achieve and nearly impossible to consolidate . 
Negotiations cannot resolve all or even most conflicts . 
That is certainly true , for the time being , of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute . 
Even if this changes , a comprehensive settlement would help the locals but not affect the dynamics of neighboring countries or conflicts . 
That said , a narrow ceasefire between Israel and Hamas should be pursued . 
Likewise , diplomacy can work in Syria only if it accepts the reality on the ground ( including the survival of the Assad regime for the foreseeable future ) , rather than seeking to transform it . 
The answer is not to be found in drawing new maps , though once populations have shifted and political stability has been restored , recognition of new borders might prove both desirable and viable . 
Policymakers must recognize their limits . 
For now and for the foreseeable future - until a new local order emerges or exhaustion sets in - the Middle East will be less a problem to be solved than a condition to be managed .
