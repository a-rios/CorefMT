Beggar-Thy-Neighbor Exchange Rates ? 
GENEVA - When the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) recently brought its interest rate down to 0.25 % , it announced that it would engage in &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; following in the footsteps of the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England . 
More surprising was the simultaneous announcement that it was intervening on the foreign-exchange market with the aim of reversing the appreciation of the franc . 
Will this be the first salvo in a war of competitive devaluations ? 
Interest rates are traditionally low in Switzerland . 
Like most other central banks confronted with the recession , the SNB has reduced its policy interest rate all the way to the zero lower bound . 
Once there , traditional monetary policy becomes impotent , as the interest-rate tool is no longer usable . 
This is why central banks are now searching for new instruments . 
Quantitative easing represents one such attempt . 
It remains to be seen whether it can effectively restore some monetary-policy influence . 
However , an important issue is rarely mentioned : in small , open economies - a description that applies to almost every country except the US - the main channel of monetary policy is the exchange rate . 
This channel is ignored for one good reason : exchange-rate policies are fundamentally of the beggar-thy-neighbor variety . 
Unconventional policies that aim at weakening the exchange rate are technically possible even at zero interest rates , and they are quite likely to be effective at the level of individual countries . 
Boosting competitiveness through exchange-rate depreciation may not succeed in raising exports in a situation where world trade is rapidly contracting , but it can cushion the blow by switching demand toward domestically produced goods and services . 
The risk is that those countries that suffer from the switch retaliate and depreciate their own currencies . 
The first casualty would be whatever small scope remains for international policy coordination . 
The second would be the world international monetary system . 
In fact , one key reason for the creation of the International Monetary Fund was to monitor exchange-rate developments with the explicit aim of preventing beggar-thy-neighbor policies . 
This is why the Swiss move comes as a surprise . 
It is true that the franc has appreciated in real terms by 8 % since the crisis started in August 2007 . 
What this really means is that the appreciation is neither a consequence of monetary policy nor the other usual factors . 
In any case , while the Swiss authorities &quot; discomfort with the situation is understandable , their decision is disquieting . 
The Swiss franc is not the only currency that has appreciated in recent months . 
Other small economies have undergone even sharper real appreciations . 
For example , Poland and the Czech Republic have seen their currencies go up by close to 30 % and 15 % , respectively . 
Major countries also have undergone currency appreciations - 30 % for Japan and 15 % for China . 
These countries , too , are facing a recession , and , while the interest rate has not yet reached its zero bound everywhere , incentives to depreciate might grow in the near future . 
In fact , the incentives are already there . 
Some fairly large countries - Korea , Sweden , and the United Kingdom , to name a few - have already undergone some very large depreciations . 
In fact , Poland &apos;s currency recently started to depreciate . 
None of these countries &quot; central banks has indicated that it was involved in depreciating its currency . 
Of course , statements and intentions may not be identical . 
It may be that the SNB merely acknowledges what other central banks do not . 
In doing so , however , the SNB is violating a taboo : &quot; Thou shall not engage in competitive depreciations . &quot; 
Alternatively , it may be that the SNB mostly wishes to talk the franc down to break the safe-haven effect . 
Having promptly achieved depreciation , it may have succeeded . 
In that case , the franc will not move much more , in any direction , and there will be no need for further interventions . 
Nevertheless , the limited reaction to the SNB move is somewhat surprising . 
The move came one week after the IMF concluded its annual Article IV visit to Switzerland , and the report has yet to be released ; it could make for unusually interesting reading . 
Other central banks have not expressed any view , which may suggest that they do not intend to retaliate , at least at this stage . 
They may have been reassured by the SNB &apos;s official statement that the appreciation represented &quot; an inappropriate tightening of monetary conditions , &quot; and that the policy move merely aims &quot; to prevent any further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro . &quot; 
It may also be that notice has been taken of the precedent , and that those authorities that intend to use it to justify future moves are loathe to criticize it . 
In that case , the generalized silence could indicate that all other central banks entertain the possibility of using that option , which would be most worrisome .
