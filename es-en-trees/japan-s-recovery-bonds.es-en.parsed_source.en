Japan &apos;s Recovery Bonds 
TOKYO - The tsunami raced through the town at eight meters per second , the speed of a gold-medal sprinter . 
The wave &apos;s height reached 15 meters , towering above even the highest pole-vault bars . 
Ships were heaved onto hills , and cars floated like boats . 
After the wave passed , a chaotic mountain of debris was all that was left of Kamaishi , Japan &apos;s oldest steel-manufacturing town , in Iwate prefecture . 
It looked like the aftermath of the firebombing of Tokyo , or like Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bombs fell . 
Similar scenes can be found throughout the Tōhoku region , along Japan &apos;s northeastern Sanriku Coast . 
For example , in the quiet rural city of Rikuzentakata , with a population of 23,000 , it is believed that 5,000 of its 8,000 households disappeared in the disaster . 
The only buildings that remain standing are the town hall and one supermarket . 
Sendai airport , near the coast in Miyagi Prefecture , now looks more like a seaport . 
The enormous earthquake that hit the Tōhoku region on March 11 , with a magnitude of 9.0 on the Richter scale and its epicenter off the coast of Sanriku , was the largest in Japan &apos;s recorded history . 
The number of victims and the extent of the damage remains unknown , but the human loss is expected to exceed 23,000 , and economic damage is estimated to be around ¥ 25 trillion . 
Tsunami is originally a Japanese word . 
Patrick Lafcadio Hearn ( known as Koizumi Yakumo after his naturalization as a Japanese citizen ) , an Englishman born on the Greek island of Lefkada , first introduced it in his novel A Living God . 
Hearn &apos;s depiction of the Meiji-Sanriku earthquake , which in 1896 took 22,000 lives in the same region as the recent quake , was later included in elementary school textbooks under the title of &quot; The Burning of the Rice Field . &quot; 
In Hearn &apos;s novel , Gohē , a village headman who lives atop a hill in his village , notices an approaching tsunami wave when he sees seawater being drawn out rapidly from the shore . 
In order to warn his fellow villagers , who are busy with festival preparations , Gohē uses a torch to set fire to his recently cut sheaves of rice . 
The villagers who gather on the hill to put out the fire soon see below them the tsunami wreaking havoc on their town . 
Gohē &quot; s quick leadership and sacrifice saved all of the villagers . 
This story has influenced Japan ever since . 
Indeed , when Japan provided relief to the countries hit by the Sumatra earthquake in 2004 , which claimed 250,000 lives , it was keenest to promote an early warning system for tsunamis . 
Moreover , no one imagined that such a huge tsunami would ever hit Japan . 
The most unforeseen event occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant . 
The facility &apos;s robust design is similar to that of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant , the world &apos;s largest , in Niigata , which was unscathed by the Chūetsu offshore earthquake ( measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale ) in July 2007 . 
Fukushima Daiichi withstood the earthquake , but no one considered the possibility of ten-meter-high tsunami waves hitting a nuclear plant . 
Now we know that the unthinkable is possible . 
As a result , the Fukushima Daiichi plant &apos;s problems have brought the worldwide rush toward nuclear-power generation to a screeching halt . 
There are currently 443 nuclear power plants worldwide - a number that was set to double in the next 15 years . 
China alone had been planning to add 50 new power plants to the 27 plants it already has . 
It is Japan &apos;s responsibility , particularly of political leaders like me , to ensure that our experiences are reflected in the creation of safe building codes and standards for such plants worldwide . 
As for Japan , once the initial economic panic subsides , bipartisan agreement will be necessary to design and approve a budget aimed at bringing about the quickest possible recovery . 
Furthermore , Japan must find a way to compensate for the ten-million-kilowatt shortfall that the loss of the Fukushima plant implies . 
Indeed , Japan must now reevaluate its entire national energy strategy , including a review of the different usage levels in eastern and western Japan . 
But , in working towards recovery , Japan has a great advantage . 
The key word for recovery in Japanese is kizuna ( bonds ) . 
Even when faced by the vast confusion created by disaster on the scale of the recent earthquake and tsunami , Japanese relied on kizuna to help and reassure each other . 
When implementing forced blackouts in the region , for example , there were few major traffic accidents , even though traffic lights had stopped working . 
I hope that one day , after the story of Japan &apos;s recent calamity has been written , kizuna will become even more widely known than &quot; tsunami . &quot;
