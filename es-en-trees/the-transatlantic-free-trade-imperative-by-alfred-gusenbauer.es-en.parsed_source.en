The Transatlantic Free-Trade Imperative 
VIENNA - The confirmation of Michael Froman as the US Trade Representative is a fitting moment to highlight the many opportunities that a free-trade agreement between the European Union and the United States would offer Europe , America , and the world . 
Today &apos;s three-tier global economy - 6 % growth in emerging markets , 2 % growth in the US , and no growth in Europe - shows ominous signs of paralysis and nationalistic unilateralism . 
Many see currency wars looming . 
In such an economically insecure global environment , riddled with protectionist booby traps , a free-trade pact between the world &apos;s two largest trading blocs , accounting for roughly 40 % of global GDP , has never been more important . 
Historically , free trade and economic growth have gone together , as have protectionism and stagnation , and deeper trade integration of the US and EU economies would strengthen growth on both sides of the Atlantic . 
The US economy &apos;s projected 2 % growth this year , despite a 1.8 % -of-GDP cut in government spending , implies real private-sector growth of 3.8 % . 
Although both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have actively intervened to boost economic recovery , the results could not be more different . 
In the US , the banking crisis was tackled rapidly and in a sustainable manner , while Europe is still going from one bailout to the next . 
Moreover , America &apos;s stimulus program obviously worked ( notwithstanding criticism from the left for being too small , and attacks from the right for being too large ) . 
Another contributing factor may be a basic difference in mentality : many Europeans tend to over-emphasize risk when assessing opportunities . 
In any case , America is the first country in the recession-stricken part of the global economy where public stimulus has led to enough private investment and growth that fiscal consolidation has become possible . 
The more America and the EU grow together , the more the EU will benefit from the US recovery . 
Demand for European goods will increase , and the EU &apos;s member states can - and should - align their economies with US growth . 
History suggests that the hope for a self-sustained recovery in Europe might well prove deceptive ; almost always , the European economic cycle has followed and reinforced that of the US . 
Today , for example , a prolonged recession in Europe is , alongside budget cuts , generally seen as posing the greatest risk to a sustained US recovery . 
Labor costs in the US industrial sector are currently 25 % lower than the European average . 
Even more significant , however , are the differences in energy costs , which are now up to 50 % lower in the US - a gap that is likely to widen further as America &apos;s shale-gas revolution continues . 
This has led energy-intensive European industries - including producers of glass , steel , chemicals , and pharmaceuticals - to invest heavily in the US . 
Often , they manufacture high-quality upstream products , which are then processed further in Europe . 
The combination of lower production costs in the US and Europe &apos;s world-class finishing capabilities is a recipe for first-rate products at competitive prices . 
In this way , European investment is contributing to the re-industrialization of the US while simultaneously ensuring high-quality European jobs . 
But Europe must do more to reinvigorate its own manufacturing sector . 
The last attempt to create an EU-US free-trade zone , under President Bill Clinton , failed because of the EU &apos;s rigid , antiquated agricultural policy . 
A new effort would help Europe to replace its agricultural policy with a research-and-development policy aimed at boosting industrial competitiveness . 
Despite all the lip service paid at multilateral summits to policy coordination , imbalances within the global economy are fueling a rise in tensions . 
At a time when many are seeking salvation in nationalism , an EU-US free-trade zone would be a powerful symbol of cooperation in overcoming global challenges . 
The increasing economic weight of Asia is also a geopolitical game-changer . 
China &apos;s massive arms build-up shows that economic power without military power is only a temporary phenomenon . 
So the focus in world politics is shifting from the Atlantic to the Pacific . 
Europe should know where it belongs . 
An EU-US free-trade zone would strengthen transatlantic political bonds and effectively refute the frequent lament that America has lost interest in Europe . 
In his second inaugural address , President Barack Obama called an EU-US free-trade zone a core project of his second term . 
Now it is up to export-oriented EU countries like Germany , the Netherlands , Sweden , and Austria to press for action on the American offer of negotiations . 
Europe has engaged in navel-gazing for long enough . 
Its malaise has raised questions about whether its democratic capitalism will survive the economic challenge posed by authoritarian and quasi-authoritarian regimes . 
I , for one , prefer making political decisions to wallowing in doubt and self-pity . 
A transatlantic trade pact would align both economies with the fundamental interests of the West .
