The Fear Profiteers 
OXFORD - Just when it seemed that America &apos;s &quot; Homeland Security state &quot; could not get more surreal , the United States Transportation Security Administration has rolled out a costly Scylla and Charybdis at major airports : either you accept dangerous doses of radiation and high-resolution imaging of your naked body , or , worried about the health risks of cumulative radiation , you opt out of the new full-body x-ray machines ( rapidly dubbed &quot; porno-scanners &quot; ) . 
But if you opt out , you are now subjected , as I was last week , to an extraordinarily sexualized and invasive &quot; pat-down &quot; by TSA officials . 
&quot; I will now touch your private parts , &quot; a very uncomfortable female TSA official said to me when I flew out of New York &apos;s Kennedy Airport . 
Men report handling of their testicles and penises , TSA officials are instructed to open and peer down waistbands , and YouTube is now rife with videos of frightened children being - to describe it accurately - sexually molested , though this is the last thing most TSA officials wish to do . 
Are we free not to be radiated or groped ? 
We are not . 
Passengers who have refused to be patted down on their genitals have been handcuffed to chairs . 
Each new terror alert or high-tech innovation , it seems , makes new demands on our liberty in the name of security . 
In fact , America &apos;s bizarre new policy is likely to remain unique among airports in the industrialized countries , if not the entire world . 
Israeli security officials , for example , scoff at genital pat-downs , which they say accomplish nothing . 
That is not exactly true . 
Twenty-four per cent of women have been sexually assaulted , or molested by a trusted adult in childhood or adolescence - as have 17 % of men . 
Many of these survivors will be re-traumatized when strangers grope their genitals . 
Years of sensitive educational outreach have finally made it the norm for American children to understand that their bodies are their own , that adults should not touch them intimately or in ways that make them uncomfortable , and that they can expect to be protected from such violation . 
By desensitizing children to sexually inappropriate touching , the pat-downs are destroying those hard-won gains . 
TSA officials have been advised to tell small children that the sexual pat-downs are a game . 
To anyone who has ever counseled survivors of childhood sexual abuse , this should set off alarm bells : the most common ploy of sexual predators is to portray the abuse as a &quot; game . &quot; 
As Ken Wooden of the organization Child Lures Prevention puts it , the TSA &apos;s &quot; incredibly misinformed and misguided &quot; advice &quot; is completely contrary to what we in the sexual-abuse prevention field have been trying to accomplish for the past 30 years . &quot; 
Americans , for once , are fighting back against this latest violation of their rights . 
Two states , New Jersey and Idaho , recently introduced legislation to seek to opt out of the new policy . 
Questions about the change in practice have reached US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - who admitted that she herself would resist a sexual pat-down - and President Barack Obama . 
So what led to a policy that is appalling to citizens , damaging to children , and ineffective for improving our security ? 
Welcome to America &apos;s current reality , in which threats are hyped so that a handful of insiders can make a killing . 
Shortly after former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff made the rounds of TV shows arguing in favor of such measures to thwart &quot; bad guys , &quot; one of his consulting firm &apos;s clients , Rapiscan , won the $ 350 million contract to provide the full-body x-ray machines . 
As one TSA supervisor said to me after my own sexualized pat-down , &quot; This is about bureaucracy - people trying to cover their asses - and there is a ton of money involved as well . &quot; 
Meanwhile , the supervisor confirmed - as has online discussion by TSA employees - that workers ordered to molest travelers are traumatized , too . 
One army veteran said that he cries every day from the resistance and outcry he now faces from passengers , and that the stress is worse than being on active military deployment . 
Others say they feel degraded and ashamed . 
Indeed , TSA workers are now working in a sexually hostile environment , which is illegal . 
Finally , one must ask : is there a psychological element to the US requirement of submission to genital groping by uniformed officials ? 
It is impossible to forget the many strange sexual twists of Bush administration policies , from forced nudity of prisoners - which post-Abu Ghraib records show was systemic , not an aberration - to the sexual threats and sexual assaults against such prisoners , the sexualized hazing rituals and accounts of rape practiced with impunity by contractors , and so on . 
I am not suggesting that sexually degrading practices are a conscious part of the TSA &apos;s new policy . 
It is not too extreme to put this into context : billions of dollars in profit now depend on insiders like Chertoff maintaining US society in a state of overhyped alert that demands increasingly costly technology . 
Maintaining these profits requires a population conditioned by this theater of fear to submit to anything - even the sexual quasi-abuse of themselves and their children .
