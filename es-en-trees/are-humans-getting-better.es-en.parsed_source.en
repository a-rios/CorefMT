Are Humans Getting Better ? 
MELBOURNE - With daily headlines focusing on war , terrorism , and the abuses of repressive governments , and religious leaders frequently bemoaning declining standards of public and private behavior , it is easy to get the impression that we are witnessing a moral collapse . 
Thirty years ago , I wrote a book called The Expanding Circle , in which I asserted that , historically , the circle of beings to whom we extend moral consideration has widened , first from the tribe to the nation , then to the race or ethnic group , then to all human beings , and , finally , to non-human animals . 
That , surely , is moral progress . 
We might think that evolution leads to the selection of individuals who think only of their own interests , and those of their kin , because genes for such traits would be more likely to spread . 
On the one hand , having a capacity to reason confers an obvious evolutionary advantage , because it makes it possible to solve problems and to plan to avoid dangers , thereby increasing the prospects of survival . 
Yet , on the other hand , reason is more than a neutral problem-solving tool . 
It is more like an escalator : once we get on it , we are liable to be taken to places that we never expected to reach . 
In particular , reason enables us to see that others , previously outside the bounds of our moral view , are like us in relevant respects . 
Excluding them from the sphere of beings to whom we owe moral consideration can then seem arbitrary , or just plain wrong . 
Steven Pinker &apos;s recent book The Better Angels of Our Nature lends weighty support to this view . 
Pinker , a professor of psychology at Harvard University , draws on recent research in history , psychology , cognitive science , economics , and sociology to argue that our era is less violent , less cruel , and more peaceful than any previous period of human existence . 
The decline in violence holds for families , neighborhoods , tribes , and states . 
In essence , humans living today are less likely to meet a violent death , or to suffer from violence or cruelty at the hands of others , than their predecessors in any previous century . 
Many people will doubt this claim . 
Some hold a rosy view of the simpler , supposedly more placid lives of tribal hunter-gatherers relative to our own . 
( For comparison , in the first half of the twentieth century , the two world wars caused a death rate in Europe of not much more than 3 % . ) 
Even those tribal peoples extolled by anthropologists as especially &quot; gentle &quot; - for example , the Semai of Malaysia , the Kung of the Kalahari , and the Central Arctic Inuit - turn out to have murder rates that are , relative to population , comparable to Detroit , which has one of the highest murder rates in the United States . 
In Europe , your chance of being murdered is now less than one-tenth , and in some countries only one-fiftieth , of what it would have been had you lived 500 years ago . 
Pinker accepts that reason is an important factor underlying the trends that he describes . 
In support of this claim , he refers to the &quot; Flynn Effect &quot; - the remarkable finding by the philosopher James Flynn that since IQ tests were first administered , scores have risen considerably . 
The average IQ is , by definition , 100 ; but , to achieve that result , raw test results have to be standardized . 
If the average teenager today took an IQ test in 1910 , he or she would score 130 , which would be better than 98 % of those taking the test then . 
It is not easy to attribute this rise to improved education , because the aspects of the tests on which scores have risen the most do not require a good vocabulary , or even mathematical ability , but instead assess powers of abstract reasoning . 
One theory is that we have gotten better at IQ tests because we live in a more symbol-rich environment . 
Flynn himself thinks that the spread of the scientific mode of reasoning has played a role . 
Pinker argues that enhanced powers of reasoning give us the ability to detach ourselves from our immediate experience and from our personal or parochial perspective , and frame our ideas in more abstract , universal terms . 
It is just this kind of reasoning ability that improved during the twentieth century . 
So there are grounds to believe that our improved reasoning abilities have enabled us to reduce the influence of those more impulsive elements of our nature that lead to violence . 
Perhaps this underlies the significant drop in deaths inflicted by war since 1945 - a decline that has become even steeper over the past 20 years . 
If so , there would be no denying that we continue to face grave problems , including of course the threat of catastrophic climate change .
