Japan \ u0027s Emerging China Strategy 
Football hooliganism and nationalism create a witch &apos;s brew that , until lately , has rarely been sipped in Asia . 
That changed at the recent Asian Football Cup . 
Wherever Japan &apos;s players went , they were met by hostile crowds , which culminated in the championship match with China before a huge - and hugely hostile - crowd in Beijing . 
This is especially worrisome because , unlike elsewhere in the world , official manipulation helps fan the flames of nationalism in China . 
Young Chinese have been thoroughly indoctrinated with anti-Japanese sentiments . 
China &apos;s former President Jiang Zemin systematically and relentlessly pursued a &quot; Resistance and Victory-over-Japan Campaign &quot; throughout the 1990 &apos;s - a sinister device used to divert popular grievances and to legitimize continuing Communist rule by making the Party appear to be the defender of Chinese honor . 
At the same time , the ancient sense of cultural superiority that runs in Chinese veins makes feelings of inferiority hard to bear . 
With China &apos;s growing sense of itself as a superpower , resentment about the country being poorer and less admired than some other nations has become intolerable . 
Now the young people who make up the vanguard of China &apos;s economic modernization are also nationalist-minded football hooligans . 
Instead of providing an early showcase of decent spectator manners for the Beijing Olympics of 2008 , the Asian Cup provided a glimpse at the rage that seethes beneath China &apos;s economic boom - and exposed the government &apos;s inability to control its increasingly restless people . 
Of course , the bitterness of Sino-Japanese relations since the end of WWII helps set the stage for such nationalist outbursts , but the roots of China &apos;s rage go deeper . 
Even as China grows richer and more powerful , memories of its past suffering and humiliation at the hands of the West and Japan remain alive - particularly because the Communist Party finds such memories so useful . 
China &apos;s modern view of foreigners and their intentions is necessarily refracted through the prism of such history . 
Perhaps inevitably , the recent anti-Japanese rage during the Asian Cup left most Japanese with a strong sense of China as an irreconcilable and unfriendly nation . 
As usual , Japan &apos;s government reacted meekly , offering superficial complaints about China to assuage domestic displeasure . 
But these complaints fail a vital diplomatic test - preservation of national dignity , prestige , and the honor of one &apos;s citizens . 
So how should Japan respond ? 
Should Japan fight fire with fire ? 
Part of the problem lies in Japan &apos;s educational system . 
Owing to a curriculum controlled by the powerful Japan Teachers Union , since the end of WWII many Japanese youth have viewed the Japan-China relationship with a consciousness of the need for atonement for the Sino-Japanese War . 
Today , however , calls are growing to promote a more accurate and balanced historical education that focuses on modern history after the Meiji Restoration and WWII , and that reflects the reality of the Sino-Japanese relationship free from an obsession with &quot; atonement . &quot; 
Obviously , calls for greater balance in historical education raise the specter of reactionary overkill : either complete affirmation of past Japanese conduct or other forms of anti-Chinese bias . 
But the majority of reform advocates seek something else : fairness and objectivity in history education , including studying the differences between Japan and China in their historical interpretations of the Sino-Japanese War . 
Equally important , unlike the subject of WWII , Japanese history education barely addresses the two countries &apos; post-war relations . 
Japanese textbooks , indeed , hardly touch upon the enormous economic aid that Japan has given to China - which , not surprisingly , is ignored completely in China &apos;s history curriculum . 
But the issue goes beyond education . 
Coerced into feeling the need to atone to China , Japan passively tolerated recent episodes of worrying Chinese behavior . 
This attitude contributed to inattention by Japan &apos;s political , administrative , academic , and media elite toward China &apos;s unlawful advance toward Japanese territories and neighboring waters , including Japan &apos;s Exclusive Economic Zone ( EEZ ) . 
China &apos;s recent and recurrent actions - such as ocean surveys for economic and military purposes , conducted without notification by navy or survey ships in Japanese territorial or EEZ waters - have , however , finally awakened Japan &apos;s elite from its inertia . 
In response , the ruling Liberal Democratic Party established a Working Team on the Protection of Maritime Interests . 
Based on the team &apos;s recommendations , the government established an inter-ministerial commission on the survey of continental shelves and maritime resources . 
The Japanese media &apos;s attention to the issue has also grown . 
More is at stake than maritime interests . 
With a revision of Japan &apos;s National Defense Program expected by year &apos;s end , the prime minister &apos;s Council on Security and Defense Capabilities has indicated a need to respond to China &apos;s military expansion , particularly its buildup of armed forces . 
&quot; China is now in the stage of surging nationalism , and the trend is expected to continue in the future , &quot; the Council warned in its interim report , concluding that , &quot; Japan must take appropriate actions in response to each incident &quot; in which China attempts to &quot; gradually advance its defense line &#91; ocean-ward &#93; . &quot; 
Japan seems to be departing from its conventional low-profile diplomacy toward China , and readying itself to construct a comprehensive long-term national and regional security strategy . 
The military core of such a strategy must include appropriate maritime tactics to respond to China &apos;s assertiveness . 
But , ultimately , the effectiveness - and hence the success - of such a strategy will depend on how Japan positions itself in the region , especially in the relationship with China . 
The Asian Football Cup highlighted not only China &apos;s growing nationalism , but also the parlous state of relations with Japan . 
A glimpse of the silent rage of China &apos;s populace has awakened Japan to the need for a comprehensive regional strategy .
