Uniting Against Extremism 
LONDON - Governments worldwide are increasingly facing a fundamental question : how to deal with the causes of violent - often religiously motivated - extremism . 
They are not short of advice - and from a wide range of sources . 
A former Al Qaeda member , for example , recently stated that the UK authorities &quot; failure to explain properly why it had not intervened in Syria &apos;s civil war risked radicalizing more Muslims . 
Meanwhile , London Mayor Boris Johnson suggested removing children from radicalized parents . 
Although such ideas have received a somewhat mixed reception , they are a welcome sign of much-needed public debate . 
Most people accept the need for security services to respond to terror , particularly in the aftermath of an attack . 
Achieving lasting change , however , requires addressing not just the consequences of extremism but also its root causes . 
What can be done ? 
First , governments must start thinking about education as a security issue . 
For example , while endlessly worrying about the existence of dangerous material online , we could do more to educate our youth in the critical thinking skills needed to dismiss such content . 
This is a new challenge , and it will not be easy . 
Before the digital revolution , young people met those from other countries and cultures in relatively restricted circumstances , such as on a holiday abroad or a school exchange program . 
Today , however , they can interact with any number of people from anywhere in the world in a matter of seconds on their smart phones . 
Many of these connections take place on un-moderated platforms that expose children to a wide variety of opinions , beliefs , and cultures - not all positive or safe . 
Unfortunately , there are few sources of good advice to help young people navigate these dangers . 
Most parents are barely able to keep up with the evolving technology , let alone oversee their children &apos;s online conversations . 
This means that it is up to our education systems to intervene early to help the connected generation interact safely in today &apos;s digital world . 
If we can teach children to recognize what they have in common with those from other cultures , we can also help them to resist the prejudices of those who seek to distort the truth and divide people . 
The Tony Blair Faith Foundation &apos;s schools program has made an important start in this respect . 
It provides a moderated space in which 12-17 year olds worldwide can discuss challenging issues from a variety of perspectives , in a respectful and safe way . 
Second , governments should support those groups that are already working on the ground and online to counter extremism . 
One approach is to encourage &quot; counter-narratives . &quot; 
In countries afflicted by religious conflict , such as Nigeria , this means helping religious leaders to develop strong inter-community relationships . 
We know that when people of different religions work together for the good of the wider community , they come to understand one another in a way that helps them resist the call of extremists . 
This type of sustained long-term work comes into its own when the worst happens . 
For example , in response to attacks last year on a church in Peshawar , Pakistan , local Muslims formed human chains around churches , allowing them to hold services . 
Such visible demonstrations of defiance in the face of violence strengthen ties between communities and can prevent the division that extremists try to generate . 
The benefits of such inter-community spirit are evident in one of the world &apos;s most diverse cities , London . 
Last June &apos;s arson attack on the Somali Bravanese Welfare Association &apos;s center in the city &apos;s Muswell Hill district ( which followed the murder of British Army fusilier Lee Rigby by religious extremists ) served only to unite its different communities . 
London Citizens , a network of local civic institutions , organized Jewish assistance programs for Somali Muslims , including after-school events at Hendon School and Eden School . 
Meanwhile , Finchley Reform Synagogue hosted a Ramadan festival , and Finchley United Synagogue hosted an Eid event . 
These activities sent a powerful signal to extremists that their attempts to turn religious communities against each other had the opposite effect . 
Third , it is essential to remove online extremist content promptly . 
YouTube uses sophisticated technical procedures to ensure that the most inappropriate videos are swiftly taken down . 
But this is only half the story : we also need to support and promote alternative , credible voices online to counter the extremist narrative . 
Of course , this does not mean uploading videos of politicians in suits telling young men not to join the jihad in Syria . 
Rather , it means identifying and backing those groups whose anti-extremist messages resonate with the intended audience . 
Finally , in these tough economic times , we need to consider cost-effective ways to promote this work globally . 
One future source of support for effective but under-resourced groups might be the recently established Global Fund for Community Engagement and Resilience , the first ever public-private global fund to support local , grass-roots efforts to counter extremism . 
As the pace of globalization and technological change accelerates , extremists are finding ever more creative ways to spread their message . 
Governments must respond in kind .
