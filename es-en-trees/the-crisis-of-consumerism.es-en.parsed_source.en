The Crisis of Consumerism 
FLORENCE - Major economic crises are inevitably also structural milestones . 
There is no simple return to a pre-crisis normalcy . 
Something changes permanently . 
As we learned in 2009 , patterns of expectations and demand take a new shape . 
Our current crisis is not simply a blowback effect of financial globalization . 
Financial globalization misfired because it took a bet on a type of economy that was becoming unsustainable . 
During the past quarter-century , but especially over the five years leading up to 2008 , the world seemed to revolve around the American consumer . 
American-style consumption offered a new model of economic development . 
It inspired widespread emulation . 
Over the course of a few decades , major city centers across the world began to resemble each other much more closely , with the same brands , designs , and lifestyles . 
Consumption or , more precisely , consumerism , appeared to be globalized . 
American universities delivered new curricula based on studies of consumption and consumerism . 
In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , President George W. Bush advised Americans that they should not allow the trauma of the attacks to interfere with their ordinary shopping , and implied that buying had become a patriotic duty and virtue . 
The United States had become the world &apos;s consumer of last resort . 
The post-2007 crisis was not simply a financial affair . 
It began as a result of weakness in a specific sector - residential mortgages - after a bubble in home prices allowed many Americans to borrow massively , and often disastrously , against the putative value of their equity in order to finance purchases . 
The global imbalances that many people view as being at the root of the problem reflected savings rates of near zero in the US , as well as in those economies that seemed best to emulate the American model - the United Kingdom , Ireland , and Spain . 
In the course of the crisis , these debt-ridden economies &quot; consumers abruptly changed their purchasing habits . 
Savings rates shot up . 
Spending on automobiles ground to a halt , until government stimulus programs in many countries revived it . 
But schemes such as public subsidies for scrapping old and fuel-inefficient cars simply led many people to re-schedule their purchases . 
The automobile market was rescued in 2009 at the expense of sales in 2010 and subsequent years . 
The crisis also revealed the extent of the massive over-capacity in the US retail market , with estimates that at least one-fifth of American shopping malls would be forced to close . 
The response to the crisis will be a hastening of the movement toward on-line purchases , in which physical location is no longer a preeminent part of shopping decisions . 
High-value and luxury brands were brutally affected by a wave of deep discounting in the last quarter of 2008 . 
The aura of a brand is easily destroyed . 
One reaction has been to look for radically new marketing strategies , as in the case of the up-market Jimmy Choo brand of women &apos;s shoes , now to be sold in a simpler guise by the low-price mass retailer Hampamp ; M. 
Such recovery as there has been in the luxury market has been largely limited to so-called affordable luxuries - shoes , handbags , or ties , rather than yachts or fast cars . 
Purchases of these relatively low-cost items can be regarded as the withdrawal symptoms of the world &apos;s consumer binge . 
The consumer age was the product of two previous crises . 
The Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s was interpreted as the result of inadequate consumption , of poverty in the midst of plenty . 
Governments took on the responsibility of stabilizing and organizing consumption on a wider level . 
A second major global crisis , in the 1970 &quot; s , shook the heavy-industrial basis of manufacturing , and with it the idea that governments should manage the economy . 
The 1970 &quot; s produced a new model of sustaining consumption through individualized desire . 
Production was decentralized and focused on the creation of niche products for highly specialized markets . 
Consumption became primarily an individual phenomenon through which people could distinguish themselves . 
In retrospect , the 1970 &quot; s mark the end of an era dominated by mass production , and the beginning of the new consumer age . 
Sometimes the age of productionism is also called &quot; Fordism , &quot; after Henry Ford , who supplied large quantities of cheap but identical cars . 
Rather unimaginatively , the consumer age is dubbed post-Fordism . 
In fact , it could be called &quot; Tom Fordism , &quot; after the young American designer who realized the iconic potential of the Italian fashion house of Gucci . 
What will replace the age of consumerism ? 
The most obvious answer is that the shift to a service economy - already well under way by the beginning of the new millennium - will become more complete . 
Consumerism depended on a radical notion of individualism . 
We become indebted in order to consume because we are convinced that our utility schedule is more important than someone else &apos;s . 
If I see a beautiful piece of jewelry or a bright new car in a shop , I am convinced that it should be mine , and that it can be more usefully employed in my possession than in someone else &apos;s . 
In that way , greed feeds on a kind of pride or self-regard . 
The empirical study of happiness has produced evidence that the satisfaction from buying objects is short-lived and depends on continued repetition . 
That is socially , morally , and environmentally wasteful . 
On the other hand , the consumption of experiences ( rather than objects ) produces a more sustained satisfaction . 
The new service economy emphasizes human interaction more than individualistic consumption . 
In an extreme form , luxury hotels are now organizing service in local community projects as a way of engaging the passions of their wealthy patrons . 
This service economy may generate higher levels of overall well-being if it emphasizes that humans do not exist as separate islands , but existentially depend on their relations with others .
