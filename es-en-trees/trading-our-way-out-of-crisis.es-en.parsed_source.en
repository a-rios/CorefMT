Trading Our Way Out of Crisis 
GENEVA - Global trade contracted in 2009 at a rate not seen since the Great Depression , and those paying the heaviest price are those who can least afford it . 
So , when trade ministers from the World Trade Organization &apos;s 153 members gather in Geneva later this month , the issue of how the WTO and the global trading system can help the poorest countries will be high on the agenda . 
Driven largely by collapsing domestic demand and production levels , but also by a shortage of affordable trade finance , trade volumes will fall by more than 10 % this year . 
Whether trade will recover next year is an open question . 
Despite some evidence that trade volumes grew over the summer , recovery has been patchy - and so fragile that a sudden shock in equity or currency markets could once again undermine consumer and business confidence , leading to a further deterioration of trade . 
The world &apos;s poorest countries face the greatest hardship when trade languishes . 
They do not have the luxury of cobbling together fiscal-stimulus packages or rescuing ailing industries in order to cushion the shock brought about by the economic crisis . 
For them , trade represents a huge share of overall economic activity and is unquestionably the best avenue for exiting a crisis that has hit them hard . 
The irony is that trade has collapsed just when these countries were becoming increasingly active in global markets , with their exports rising by more than 20 % during this decade . 
For nations that depend on trade , the sharp drop in exports this year was crippling . 
Since the crisis began , export earnings of the world &apos;s poorest countries are down $ 26.8 billion , or 44 % . 
The WTO Ministerial Conference later this month will provide an occasion to consider the best ways to generate growth and alleviate poverty in these countries . 
Concluding the Doha round of trade negotiations by the end of 2010 - as world leaders have said they wish to do - is one of them . 
A Doha deal represents one of the most valuable tools at our disposal to help meet the United Nations &quot; Millennium Development Goals . 
Frankly , all of us already know what needs to be done . 
Yet the Doha Round has fallen victim to basic misunderstandings - first , about why countries trade , and , second , about how they trade . 
Countries trade , first and foremost , because it is in their interest to do so . 
It is in a country &apos;s interest to lower its import barriers so that it has cheaper access to goods and services that it cannot produce competitively . 
Trade increases competition and keeps inflation in check . 
In this way , trade can raise living standards . 
Moreover , countries that lower their import barriers also end up exporting more . 
The reluctance of trade negotiators to pursue what is in their obvious self-interest reflects another , more serious misunderstanding about the manner in which nations trade . 
Consider United States-China trade in iPods . 
Every iPod that the US decides not to import means a $ 150 &quot; decline &quot; in China &apos;s recorded exports , though only about $ 4 of that value is actually added in China . 
Japan , which contributes about $ 100 in value , suffers far more from China &apos;s supposed decline in exports . 
Clearly , the words &quot; made in &quot; mean something very different from what they meant 20 years ago . 
Our production processes are so globalized that a country &apos;s import tariffs could well penalize imports from one of its own global companies . 
For many countries , particularly in the developing world , reducing obstacles to trade is insufficient for fuller participate in the global economy , because they also need to build their capacity to trade . 
That is the central aim of the Aid for Trade initiative . 
Despite the economic crisis , Aid for Trade donor contributions to help the less fortunate have risen 10 % per year since 2005 , and major donors are on track to meet or exceed their pledges for future funds . 
Several major countries have agreed to increase their contributions this year to building infrastructure , productive capacity , and know-how in the developing world . 
But Aid for Trade is no substitute for the market-opening opportunities and improved rules promised by the Doha round . 
WTO members have already agreed that rich countries - and developing countries that are in a position to do so - would open their markets completely to 97 % of exports from the world &apos;s poorest countries , and dramatically reduce duties for those products where barriers remain . 
As a result , cotton subsidies , which depress prices and displace African exports , would be sharply curtailed , and cotton exports from poor countries would receive duty-free , quota-free treatment in rich-country markets . 
All trade-distorting farm subsidies would be slashed by 70 % -80 % in the major subsidizing countries . 
New rules on streamlining customs procedures would sharply reduce transit times . 
We must make progress on this agenda . 
What is frustrating is that we are tantalizingly close to a deal which , according to the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics , would deliver global economic benefits of $ 300- $ 700 billion annually . 
But , to reap these benefits , we must close the deal . 
The next Ministerial Conference ought to signal that we are ready to do so .
