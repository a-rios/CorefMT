The Economic Governance the EU Needs 
BRUSSELS - Two lessons have emerged from Europe &apos;s financial crisis . 
First , there is no substitute for timely and coordinated action when the single currency is under pressure . 
Second , all eurozone countries are effectively in the same boat . 
If the boat springs a leak , everyone sinks . 
A quicker and more concerted response might have limited the fall-out from the crisis , and thus its cost . 
The European Financial Stabilization Facility ( EFSF ) , hurriedly established in May 2010 in an effort to stop the rot , will shortly be able to call on some € 500 billion in the event that any more eurozone countries face serious liquidity problems . 
And eurozone member states have agreed to perpetuate this financial-stability mechanism from 2013 onwards , and even to amend the Lisbon treaty to avoid any legal ambiguity . 
Despite all this , markets remain unconvinced by the eurozone &apos;s shows of solidarity . 
Greek sovereign debt has been downgraded to below that of Egypt . 
Portugal has had to ask for assistance from the EFSF and the International Monetary Fund . 
Irish banks reportedly need an additional € 24 billion to stay afloat . 
And Spain is doing all it can to avoid the contagion . 
The irony is that the euro has been a hugely successful project , bringing considerable stability to participating countries . 
Indeed , without the single currency , many of these countries would have succumbed to a downward spiral of devaluation , default , and recourse to the IMF . 
The European Central Bank has played a crucial role in preventing a worst-case scenario , but the obvious lacuna in Europe &apos;s economic and monetary union ( EMU ) remains : EMU established only a monetary union and largely omitted the economic union that has proven so closely linked to the euro &apos;s strengths and weaknesses . 
The real crisis facing Europe is one of economic governance . 
Eurozone member states have increasingly gone their own way , even overtly defending nationalist economic policies that harm the eurozone as a whole . 
This is not to say that a single economic policy should be imposed on everyone ; but Europe does need a higher degree of coordination and convergence to ensure that everyone is at least heading in the same direction . 
Like cars on a highway , some may drive more slowly than others , but there are minimum and maximum speeds and all must go with the flow of traffic . 
Moreover , all motorists must respect the rules of the road , and anyone who breaches them must be held to account , and possibly penalized , because even one rogue driver will most likely cause a major pile-up if not stopped . 
So it is with economic governance : anarchy would be devastating . 
Agreement is needed on both the rules and the impartial body to enforce them . 
European Union leaders have in recent summits come close to identifying a number of economic-policy areas where closer coordination would improve competitiveness , including sustainability of pensions , wage-to-productivity ratios , corporate taxation , investment in research and development , and the financing of major infrastructure projects . 
Yet the same EU members have failed to endow the European Commission with overall responsibility for holding member governments to their commitments and , where necessary , imposing penalties for breaches . 
This intergovernmental approach lay behind the Lisbon Agenda &apos;s failure to deliver the results needed to make Europe more competitive and dynamic by 2010 , and the same shortcomings will bedevil its successor , the new &quot; Europe 2020 &quot; strategy . 
Indeed , it is a failure of governance that has characterized the Stability and Growth Pact , designed ( largely by Germany ) to ensure sound macroeconomic policy by limiting national debt and deficit ratios . 
Most eurozone members are now in breach of the Pact , yet none has been subjected to the penalties envisaged by its architects . 
Recently adopted changes create a more sensible and graduated system for sanctioning recalcitrant countries , but still leave the decision to initiate an excessive deficit procedure to member states , rather than establishing the more automatic mechanism sought by the European Commission . 
Meanwhile , the Commission already polices the internal market - one of Europe &apos;s major policy successes - by monitoring member states &quot; compliance with the single market &apos;s rules . 
It also launches infringement proceedings against member states that have not implemented valid directives on time , or in the correct manner . 
Similarly , EU competition policy has stood firm for many years against monopolies and abuse of dominant market positions . 
Here , too , the Commission plays the role of neutral judge . 
There may be disputes in some cases , but the system has brought a degree of legal certainty across the single market that the EU &apos;s member states could not have achieved on their own . 
The challenge now for EU leaders is not to repackage old policies , but to express a collective vision and will to act together . 
I have been arguing for a Community Act that would bring together all elements of economic governance under a single framework , with the European Commission at its center . 
As with the single-market program of the 1980 &quot; s , the Commission could be in charge of overseeing a convergence of national economic policies , within certain parameters , throughout the EU . 
Straying outside of those parameters would lead to warnings and sanctions , but otherwise there would be some flexibility for member states to pursue the EU &apos;s collective goals at a pace adapted to their national circumstances . 
A cluster of EU commissioners holding economic-related portfolios could even be made responsible for guiding the process forward , providing it with direction and momentum . 
If European countries are to emerge stronger from the current crisis , they need to think bigger and put more faith , not less , in the collective enterprise that is the EU . 
After all , European unification was conceived as a project of pooled sovereignty , not surrendered prosperity .
