Arafat &apos;s Last Hurrrah 
In his protracted moment of death , Yasir Arafat performed his last act of duty to the Palestinian cause to which he devoted his entire life . 
Everything about the man was , indeed , protracted . 
He carried out a protracted war of national liberation . 
He withstood a series of protracted sieges - in Amman ( 1970 ) , Beirut ( 1982 ) , and in Ramallah ( 2002-2004 ) . 
Arafat &apos;s leadership was the most protracted among his counterparts in the Arab World , as he outlived three Egyptian Presidents ( Naguib , Nasser , Sadat and spanned all of Mubarak &apos;s quarter of a century ) , five Lebanese Presidents , three Iraqis , five Algerians , three Syrians , three Saudi Monarchs , and two in Morocco , not to mention other world leaders , from Eisenhower to Bush in the US , from de Gaulle to Chirac in France , and from Ma√≥ to three successors in China . 
Probably no other political figure alive today met and endured as many world leaders as Arafat . 
But there is much more to Arafat &apos;s legacy than endurance . 
It has been correctly said over and again that Arafat was a mixed blessing for his people . 
Their fate and destiny have been inextricably linked , to the near demise of both at times . 
For several decades after the usurpation of their homeland , Palestinians were reduced to aggregates of refugees , some remaining in the newly-created state of Israel as second-class citizens , with others scattered over the Arab World and far beyond . 
It was Yasir Arafat , through the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) he founded , that gave them a sense of identity as a people . 
Regardless of its effectiveness , the armed struggle waged by the PLO did empower the Palestinians and internalize a sense of collective dignity and self respect within them . 
Their cause could no longer be ignored . 
No other modern issue has appropriated as many UN resolutions or as much international diplomacy . 
If politics is defined as the art of compromise , Arafat was a master of it at the Palestinian and Arab levels . 
He managed to stay at the helm for over forty years with no serious challengers . 
Internationally , however , he was out of step with the post Cold War era . 
Whether or not he was solely to blame , a true opportunity for historical compromise was missed at Camp David in August 2000 , and he himself acknowledged it a year later . 
By that time it was too late , as the leadership in both the US and Israel had changed and there was no interest to engage him . 
During the last four years of his life , Arafat &apos;s public space was literally and metaphorically diminishing . 
He was unable to re-engage his Israeli adversaries or control his suicide-bound Palestinian militants . 
Nor was he able to contain let alone combat rampant corruption in the Palestinian Authority . 
Nor was Arafat helped by world events that shifted the spotlight to Bush &apos;s wars on terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
If anything , they had adverse effects for him and his life-long cause . 
Like his own body , Arafat &apos;s familiar world was steadily fading away with irreversible loss of control . 
Ironically however , as he was dying , world leaders and the media were rediscovering the importance of Arafat &apos;s leadership if not his persona . 
The sustained focus of the media on him , to the point of near saturation , focused world attention on the Palestinian Question once again . 
Statements by Tony Blair , Jacques Chirac , Kofi Annan and others on the occasion of Arafat &apos;s death have been forceful in demanding a speedy and long overdue resolution of the conflict . 
It is as if in death , Arafat has given his people a chance to achieve what he could not achieve in life -the dream of an independent democratic Palestinian state . 
It is Arafat &apos;s last hurrah .
