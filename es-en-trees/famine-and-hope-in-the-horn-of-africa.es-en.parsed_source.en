Famine and Hope in the Horn of Africa 
NAIROBI - Yet again , famine stalks the Horn of Africa . 
More than ten million people are fighting for survival , mainly pastoralist communities in the hyper-arid regions of Somalia , Ethiopia , and northern Kenya . 
Every day brings news of more deaths and massive inflows of starving people into refugee camps in Kenya , across the border from Somalia . 
The immediate cause of this disaster is clear : the rains have failed for two years running in the dry regions of East Africa . 
These are places where water is so scarce year after year that crop production is marginal at best . 
Millions of households , with tens of millions of nomadic or semi-nomadic people , tend camels , sheep , goats , and other livestock , which they move large distances to reach rain-fed pasturelands . 
When the rains fail , the grasses shrivel , the livestock die , and communities face starvation . 
Pastoralism has long been a harrowing existence in the Horn of Africa . 
The location of life-supporting pasturelands is determined by the unstable and largely unpredictable rains , rather than by political boundaries . 
Yet we live in an era when political boundaries , not the lives of nomadic pastoralists , are sacrosanct . 
These boundaries , together with growing populations of sedentary farmers , have hemmed in pastoralist communities . 
The political boundaries exist as a legacy of the colonial era , not as the result of cultural realities and economic needs . 
Somalia , for example , contains only a part of the Somali-speaking pastoralist population , with large numbers living across the border in Kenya and Ethiopia . 
As a result , the Ethiopian-Somalia border has been war-torn for decades . 
A massive drought this year was not exactly predictable , but the risk of famine was easily foreseeable . 
Indeed , two years ago , in a meeting with US President Barack Obama , I described the vulnerability of the African drylands . 
When the rains fail there , wars begin . 
I showed Obama a map from my book Common Wealth , which depicts the overlap of dryland climates and conflict zones . 
I noted to him that the region urgently requires a development strategy , not a military approach . 
Obama responded that the US Congress would not support a major development effort for the drylands . 
&quot; Find me another 100 votes in Congress , &quot; he said . 
I don &apos;t know whether Obama &apos;s leadership might have found those votes , but I do know that the US has not mustered the national effort to respond effectively to the Horn of Africa &apos;s needs . 
The US is far too focused on expensive and failed military approaches in the drylands - whether in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Yemen , or Somalia - to pay heed to long-term economic development strategies aimed at addressing the root causes of these countries &quot; ongoing crises . 
This year &apos;s drought came at a time of political and economic turmoil in both the US and Europe . 
America &apos;s distorted political system gives the rich everything they want in the form of tax cuts , while slashing programs for the poor . 
There is no interest in Washington , DC , in addressing the needs of America &apos;s poor , much less the needs of the world &apos;s poor . 
In Europe , the global financial crisis of 2008 left a legacy of deep political and economic crisis in the weaker economies of Southern Europe . 
This crisis absorbed almost all of the European Union &apos;s political attention this summer , even as famine in Africa has worsened . 
The unfolding disaster in the Horn of Africa will not solve itself , and four factors make the situation potentially explosive . 
First , long-term human-induced climate change seems to be bringing more droughts and climate instability . 
The US and Europe are not only failing to respond to the African drought ; they have probably contributed to it through their greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Second , fertility rates and population growth in the Horn of Africa continue to be extremely high , even as children perish in the famine . 
Unless and until widespread family planning and modern contraceptive services are established , expanding populations in the Horn of Africa will crash against a harsher future climate . 
Third , the region is already living in extreme poverty , so adverse shocks push it toward calamity . 
And , finally , regional politics is highly unstable , leaving the Horn extremely vulnerable to conflict . 
But there is still realistic hope . 
The Millennium Villages Project , which I have the honor of helping to lead , has demonstrated that pastoralist communities can be empowered through targeted investments in livestock management , veterinary care , business development , mobile health clinics , boarding schools , and local infrastructure such as safe water points , off-grid electricity , and mobile telephony . 
Cutting-edge technologies , together with strong community leadership , can unlock long-term sustainable development . 
The countries of the Horn of Africa are now stepping forward to help themselves through this approach . 
Six countries in the region with large dryland zones - Ethiopia , Somalia , Kenya , Uganda , Djibouti , and South Sudan - have joined together in a Drylands Initiative to use best practices and cutting-edge technologies to support their pastoralist communities &quot; effort to escape the scourges of extreme poverty and famine . 
Many companies , such as Ericsson , Airtel , Novartis , and Sumitomo Chemical , are participating in this effort by making their technologies available to impoverished pastoralist communities . 
A new regional partnership is starting to take hold , beginning with the affected communities and their national governments . 
Several countries in the Arabian Peninsula , just across the Red Sea from the Horn , are also showing an encouraging readiness to deploy their oil earnings for emergency relief and long-term development . 
The Islamic Development Bank , representing the 57 members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation , is also showing leadership . 
Through this new partnership of communities , governments , businesses , and academia , the current crisis could yet mark the start of regional recovery and development .
