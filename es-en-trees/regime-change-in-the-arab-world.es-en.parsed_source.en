Regime Change in the Arab World 
Four years into a disastrous military adventure in Iraq and with the global war on terror against ill-defined forces of darkness still inconclusive , the collapse of America &apos;s grand strategy has exposed how ill-conceived was its simplistic recipe for democratic change in the Arab world . 
The paradox is that America might be winning the war for Arab democracy , even if by default , but cannot reap the benefits , simply because the emerging pattern of Islamic pluralistic politics does not coincide with the West &apos;s brand of secular liberal democracy . 
The shift of the Arab world &apos;s mainstream fundamentalist movements to democratic politics is tantamount to a repudiation of the jihadist project and of al-Qaeda &apos;s apocalyptic strategies . 
The failure of jihadism is paving the way for a potentially promising restructuring of Islamic politics , but the West either doesn &apos;t recognize the changes or is hostile to them . 
The rise of Islamists throughout the region as the sole power capable of exploiting the opportunities of free elections - Hamas &quot; victory in Palestine and the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s spectacular gains in the 2005 Egyptian elections are but the most noteworthy - the ascendancy to regional hegemony of Shiite Iran , and the sense among Arab rulers that the embattled Bush administration is running out of steam have all combined to stall the promising drive to political reform in the region . 
The US retreated from its democratic designs once it realized that Arab democracy is not being identified with the liberal secular opposition , a political force that practically does not exist in the Arab world , but with Islamic radicals that are seek to repudiate America &apos;s policies and the cause of reconciliation with Israel . 
That this should be so has of course much to do with America &apos;s traditional policy of sustaining the Arab world &apos;s pro-Western dictators . 
But the notion that the genii of democratization can now be squeezed back into the bottle is a self-serving fantasy . 
The move of mainstream Islamists , like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt , the Islamic Action Front in Jordan , Hamas in Palestine , the Renaissance Party in Tunisia , or the Party of Justice and Development in Morocco , away from jihadism to political participation started well before America &apos;s democracy promotion campaign , and is not an attempt to please the West . 
It is a genuine response to the needs and demands of their supporters . 
Extinguishing Arab democracy , as President Mubarak of Egypt is now trying to do through his recent ban on political parties that are based on religion , will bring neither stability nor peace to the Middle East . 
It will only exacerbate the rage of the masses at the West &apos;s hypocrisy , now expressed in a form of democratic charlatanry . 
The stability of those Arab regimes that are not sustained by a democratic consensus is bound to be fragile and misleading . 
Just as Islamic democracy is the natural reaction to Arab secular autocracy and to the West &apos;s collaboration with it , so will the destruction of political Islam usher in even more extreme options with movements like Hamas going back to social work and terror , and with al-Qaeda making inroads into Islamic societies . 
Both the West and the Arab rulers need to realize that the tense equation between the incumbent regimes and political Islam is not necessarily a zero-sum game . 
This has been learned the hard way by Algerian President Bouteflika who , through his Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation of February 2006 , brought an end to a long and bloody civil war , the origins of which lay in the violent cancellation by the military of the Islamist Front &apos;s ( FIS ) electoral victory in 1991 . 
It is in this context that the historic compromise between the religious ( Hamas ) and the secular ( Fatah ) to form a national unity government for Palestine might have established a new paradigm for the future of regime change in the Arab world . 
The concept of national unity governments might , indeed , be the formula that makes it possible to hold together the political families in the Arab world . 
King Muhammad VI of Morocco has already indicated that the Crown would consider a &quot; historic compromise &quot; with the Islamists should they , as predicted , win the elections in June 2007 . 
Such compromises may be the only way to stem the slide to civil war , and possibly also co-opt the Islamists into a settlement with Israel and a rapprochement to the West . 
Engaging political Islam will need to be the central part of any successful strategy for the Middle East . 
Instead of sticking to doomsday prophecies or to categorical perspectives that prevent an understanding of the complex fabric of Islamic movements , the West needs to keep the pressure on the incumbent regimes to stop circumventing political reform . 
As Algeria in the 1990 &quot; s showed , exclusion of the Islamists is a recipe for disaster , while inclusion can breed moderation . 
The practical necessities of politics are bound to dilute ideological purity . 
The Mecca agreement that brought forth the unity government in Palestine will inevitably temper Hamas &quot; radicalism , just as the regime &apos;s avoidance in Jordan of an &quot; Egyptian solution &quot; to the Islamist challenge allowed the Islamic Action Front to contain within the movement many who would have been otherwise drawn into the jihadist orbit . 
The challenge is not how to destroy Islamic movements , but how to turn them away from revolutionary to reformist politics by granting them legitimate political space .
