The Financial Fire Next Time 
NEW HAVEN - If we have learned anything since the global financial crisis peaked in 2008 , it is that preventing another one is a tougher job than most people anticipated . 
Not only does effective crisis prevention require overhauling our financial institutions through creative application of the principles of good finance ; it also requires that politicians and their constituents have a shared understanding of these principles . 
Today , unfortunately , such an understanding is missing . 
And , while people love to hear about &quot; reining in &quot; or &quot; punishing &quot; financial leaders , they are far less enthusiastic about asking these people to expand or improve financial-risk management . 
But , because special-interest groups have developed around existing institutions and practices , we are basically stuck with them , subject to minor tweaking . 
The financial crisis , which is still ongoing , resulted largely from the boom and bust in home prices that preceded it for several years ( home prices peaked in the United States in 2006 ) . 
During the pre-crisis boom , homebuyers were encouraged to borrow heavily to finance undiversified investments in a single home , while governments provided guarantees to mortgage investors . 
In the US , this occurred through implicit guarantees of assets held by the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) and the mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
At a session that I chaired at the American Economic Association &apos;s recent meeting in Philadelphia , the participants discussed the difficulty of getting any sensible reform out of governments around the world . 
In a paper presented at the session , Andrew Caplin of New York University spoke of the public &apos;s lack of interest or comprehension of the rising risks associated with the FHA , which has been guaranteeing privately-issued mortgages since its creation during the housing crisis of the 1930 &quot; s . 
Caplin &apos;s discussant , Joseph Gyourko of the Wharton School , concurred . 
Gyourko &apos;s own 2013 study concludes that the FHA , now effectively leveraged 30 to one on guarantees of home mortgages that are themselves leveraged 30 to one , is underwater to the tune of tens of billions of dollars . 
He wants the FHA shut down and replaced with a subsidized saving program that does not attempt to compete with the private sector in evaluating mortgage risk . 
Similarly , Caplin testified in 2010 before the US House Committee on Financial Services that the FHA was at serious risk , a year after FHA Commissioner David Stevens told the same committee that &quot; We will not need a bailout . &quot; 
Caplin &apos;s research evidently did not sit well with FHA officials , who were hostile to Caplin and refused to give him the data he wanted . 
The FHA has underestimated its losses every year since , while proclaiming itself in good health . 
Finally , in September , it was forced to seek a government bailout . 
At the session , I asked Caplin about his effort , starting with his co-authored 1997 book Housing Partnerships , which proposed allowing homebuyers to buy only a fraction of a house , thereby reducing their risk exposure without putting taxpayers at risk . 
If implemented , his innovative idea would reduce homeowners &quot; leverage . 
But , while it was a highly leveraged mortgage market that fueled the financial crisis 11 years later , the idea , he said , has not made headway anywhere in the world . 
Why not , I asked ? 
Why can &apos;t creative people with their lawyers simply create such partnerships for themselves ? 
The answer , he replied , is complicated ; but , at least in the US , one serious problem looms large : the US Internal Revenue Service &apos;s refusal to issue an advance ruling on how such risk-managing arrangements would be taxed . 
Given the resulting uncertainty , no one is in a mood to be creative . 
Meanwhile , there is strong public demand - angry and urgent - for a government response aimed at preventing another crisis and ending the problem of &quot; too big to fail &quot; financial institutions . 
But the political reality is that government officials lack sufficient knowledge and incentive to impose reforms that are effective but highly technical . 
For example , one reform adopted in the US to help prevent the &quot; too big to fail &quot; problem is the risk retention rule stipulated by the 2010 Dodd Frank Act . 
In order to ensure that mortgage securitizers have some &quot; skin in the game , &quot; they are required to retain an interest in 5 % of the mortgage securities that they create ( unless they qualify for an exemption ) . 
But , in another paper presented at our session , Paul Willen of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston argued that creating such a restriction is hardly the best way for a government to improve the functioning of financial markets . 
Investors already know that people have a stronger incentive to manage risks better if they retain some interest in the risk . 
But investors also know that other factors may offset the advantages of risk retention in specific cases . 
In trying to balance such considerations , the government is in over its head . 
The most fundamental reform of housing markets remains something that reduces homeowners &quot; overleverage and lack of diversification . 
In my own paper for the session , I returned to the idea of the government encouraging privately-issued mortgages with preplanned workouts , thereby insuring them against the calamity of ending up underwater after home prices fall . 
Like housing partnerships , this would be a fundamental reform , for it would address the core problem that underlay the financial crisis . 
But there is no impetus for such a reform from existing interest groups or the news media . 
One of our discussants , Joseph Tracy of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( and co-author of Housing Partnerships ) , put the problem succinctly : &quot; Firefighting is more glamorous than fire prevention . &quot; 
Just as most people are more interested in stories about fires than they are in the chemistry of fire retardants , they are more interested in stories about financial crashes than they are in the measures needed to prevent them . 
That is not a recipe for a happy ending .
