Happiness , Money , and Giving It Away 
Would you be happier if you were richer ? 
Many people believe that they would be . 
But research conducted over many years suggests that greater wealth implies greater happiness only at quite low levels of income . 
People in the United States , for example , are , on average , richer than New Zealanders , but they are not happier . 
More dramatically , people in Austria , France , Japan , and Germany appear to be no happier than people in much poorer countries , like Brazil , Colombia , and the Philippines . 
Comparisons between countries with different cultures are difficult , but the same effect appears within countries , except at very low income levels , such as below $ 12,000 annually for the US . 
Beyond that point , an increase in income doesn &apos;t make a lot of difference to people &apos;s happiness . 
Americans are richer than they were in the 1950 &quot; s , but they are not happier . 
Americans in the middle-income range today - that is , a family income of $ 50,000- $ 90,000 - have a level of happiness that is almost identical to well-off Americans , with a family income of more than $ 90,000 . 
Most surveys of happiness simply ask people how satisfied they are with their lives . 
We cannot place great confidence in such studies , because this kind of overall &quot; life satisfaction &quot; judgment may not reflect how much people really enjoy the way they spend their time . 
My Princeton University colleague Daniel Kahneman and several co-researchers tried to measure people &apos;s subjective well-being by asking them about their mood at frequent intervals during a day . 
In an article published in Science on June 30 , they report that their data confirm that there is little correlation between income and happiness . 
On the contrary , Kahneman and his colleagues found that people with higher incomes spent more time in activities that are associated with negative feelings , such as tension and stress . 
Instead of having more time for leisure , they spent more time at and commuting to work . 
They were more often in moods that they described as hostile , angry , anxious , and tense . 
Of course , there is nothing new in the idea that money does not buy happiness . 
Many religions instruct us that attachment to material possessions makes us unhappy . 
The Beatles reminded us that money can &apos;t buy us love . 
Even Adam Smith , who told us that it is not from the butcher &apos;s benevolence that we get our dinner , but from his regard for his self-interest , described the imagined pleasures of wealth as &quot; a deception &quot; ( though one that &quot; rouses and keeps in continual motion the industry of mankind &quot; ) . 
Nevertheless , there is something paradoxical about this . 
Why do governments all focus on increasing per capita national income ? 
Why do so many of us strive to obtain more money , if it won &apos;t make us happier ? 
Perhaps the answer lies in our nature as purposive beings . 
We evolved from beings who had to work hard to feed themselves , find a mate , and raise children . 
For nomadic societies , there was no point in owning anything that one could not carry , but once humans settled down and developed a system of money , that limit to acquisition disappeared . 
Accumulating money up to a certain amount provides a safeguard against lean times , but today it has become an end in itself , a way of measuring one &apos;s status or success , and a goal to fall back on when we can think of no other reason for doing anything , but would be bored doing nothing . 
Making money gives us something to do that feels worthwhile , as long as we do not reflect too much on why we are doing it . 
Consider , in this light , the life of the American investor Warren Buffett . 
For 50 years , Buffett , now 75 , has worked at accumulating a vast fortune . 
According to Forbes magazine , he is the second wealthiest person in the world , after Bill Gates , with assets of $ 42 billion . 
Yet his frugal lifestyle shows that he does not particularly enjoy spending large amounts of money . 
Even if his tastes were more lavish , he would be hard-pressed to spend more than a tiny fraction of his wealth . 
From this perspective , once Buffett earned his first few millions in the 1960 &quot; s , his efforts to accumulate more money can easily seem completely pointless . 
Is Buffett a victim of the &quot; deception &quot; that Adam Smith described , and that Kahneman and his colleagues have studied in more depth ? 
Coincidentally , Kahneman &apos;s article appeared the same week that Buffett announced the largest philanthropic donation in US history - $ 30 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and another $ 7 billion to other charitable foundations . 
Even when the donations made by Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller are adjusted for inflation , Buffett &apos;s is greater . 
At a single stroke , Buffett has given purpose to his life . 
Since he is an agnostic , his gift is not motivated by any belief that it will benefit him in an afterlife . 
What , then , does Buffett &apos;s life tell us about the nature of happiness ? 
Perhaps , as Kahneman &apos;s research would lead us to expect , Buffett spent less of his life in a positive mood than he would have if , at some point in the 1960 &quot; s , he had quit working , lived on his assets , and played a lot more bridge . 
But , in that case , he surely would not have experienced the satisfaction that he can now rightly feel at the thought that his hard work and remarkable investment skills will , through the Gates Foundation , help to cure diseases that cause death and disability to billions of the world &apos;s poorest people . 
Buffett reminds us that there is more to happiness than being in a good mood .
