Is There a New Washington Consensus ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Two and a half years ago , senior staff members of the World Bank approached the Nobel laureate Michael Spence to ask him to lead a high-powered commission on economic growth . 
The question at hand could not have been more important . 
The &quot; Washington consensus &quot; - the infamous list of do &apos;s and don &apos;ts for policymakers in developing countries - had largely dissipated . 
But what would replace it ? 
Spence was not sure he was the man for the job . 
After all , his research had focused on theoretical issues in advanced economies ; he had been dean of a business school ; and he did not have much experience in economic development . 
But he was intrigued by the task . 
And he was encouraged by the enthusiastic and positive response he received from the commission &apos;s prospective members . 
Thus was born the Spence Commission on Growth and Development , a star-studded group of policymakers - including another Nobelist - whose final report was issued at the end of May . 
The Spence report represents a watershed for development policy - as much for what it says as for what it leaves out . 
Gone are confident assertions about the virtues of liberalization , deregulation , privatization , and free markets . 
Also gone are the cookie cutter policy recommendations unaffected by contextual differences . 
Instead , the Spence report adopts an approach that recognizes the limits of what we know , emphasizes pragmatism and gradualism , and encourages governments to be experimental . 
Yes , successful economies have many things in common : they all engage in the global economy , maintain macroeconomic stability , stimulate saving and investment , provide market-oriented incentives , and are reasonably well governed . 
It is useful to keep an eye on these commonalities , because they frame the conduct of appropriate economic policies . 
Saying that context matters does not mean that anything goes . 
But there is no universal rulebook ; different countries achieve these ends differently . 
The Spence report reflects a broader intellectual shift within the development profession , a shift that encompasses not just growth strategies but also health , education , and other social policies . The traditional policy framework , which the new thinking is gradually replacing , is presumptive rather than diagnostic . 
It starts with strong preconceptions about the nature of the problem : too much ( or too little ) government regulation , too poor governance , too little public spending on health and education , and so on . 
Moreover , its recommendations take the form of the proverbial &quot; laundry list &quot; of reforms , and emphasize their complementary nature - the imperative to undertake them all simultaneously - rather than their sequencing and prioritization . 
And it is biased toward universal recipes - &quot; model &quot; institutional arrangements , &quot; best practices , &quot; rules of thumb , and so forth . 
By contrast , the new policy mindset starts with relative agnosticism about what works . 
Its hypothesis is that there is a great deal of &quot; slack &quot; in poor countries , so simple changes can make a big difference . 
As a result , it is explicitly diagnostic and focuses on the most significant economic bottlenecks and constraints . 
Rather than comprehensive reform , it emphasizes policy experimentation and relatively narrowly targeted initiatives in order to discover local solutions , and it calls for monitoring and evaluation in order to learn which experiments work . 
The new approach is suspicious of universal remedies . 
Instead , it searches for policy innovations that provide a shortcut around local economic or political complications . 
This approach is greatly influenced by China &apos;s experimental gradualism since 1978 - the most spectacular episode of economic growth and poverty reduction the world has ever seen . 
The Spence report is a consensus document , and therefore an easy target for cheap shots . 
It has no &quot; big ideas &quot; of its own , and at times it tries too hard to please everyone and cover all possible angles . 
But , as Spence puts it with regard to economic reform itself , you need to take small steps in order to make a big difference in the long run . 
It is quite a feat to have achieved the degree of consensus he has around a set of ideas that departs in places so markedly from the traditional approach . 
It is to Spence &apos;s credit that the report manages to avoid both market fundamentalism and institutional fundamentalism . 
Rather than offering facile answers such as &quot; just let markets work &quot; or &quot; just get governance right , &quot; it rightly emphasizes that each country must devise its own mix of remedies . 
Foreign economists and aid agencies can supply some of the ingredients , but only the country itself can provide the recipe . 
If there is a new Washington consensus , it is that the rulebook must be written at home , not in Washington . 
And that is real progress .
