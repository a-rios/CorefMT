Obama and India 
NEW DELHI - India has stood out around the world for being one of the few countries indifferent to America &apos;s presidential election . 
Indeed , an astounding 87 % of Indians polled said that they did not think the election mattered to them . 
President-elect Barack Obama will have to deal with disasters on many fronts as his administration takes over the reins of government . 
India , presumably , will not be one of them . 
If there is one bilateral relationship that the Bush administration is seen to have handled successfully , it is that with India . 
This impression is no accident . 
A powerful lobbying effort included millions of dollars spent to support passage of one of the crowning achievements of Bush &apos;s foreign policy : the United States-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement . 
Senator Obama voted for the deal , as did Senator Joe Biden , one of its champions as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . 
In the heady first months after it came to power , the Bush administration laid out a bold new vision that gave India - a rising Asian democracy on China &apos;s border , proximate to the shipping lanes of the Indian Ocean and to the epicenter of Islamist terrorism - a starring role in US foreign policy . 
The argument to India was essentially this : You need us to realize your ambition to become a major world power , and we share a concern over China &apos;s rise and Islamist terrorism , so let &apos;s work together . 
But the Bush administration &apos;s vision was , and remains , flawed , for it regards the US-India relationship solely as a strategic one that enhances both countries &quot; military reach . 
Indeed , India &apos;s $ 5 billion of US weapons purchases accounts for an astonishing 20 % of the $ 24.8 billion in US arms sales in 2007 . 
The flaw consists partly in viewing China , India &apos;s largest trading partner , as a threat . 
Moreover , while it is true that the US and India face terrorist threats , both have erred in their approach to dealing with them . 
America &apos;s mistakes include the Patriot Act , the invasion of Iraq , the mishandling of Afghanistan , the torture committed at Abu Ghraib , and the prison at Guant√°namo Bay . 
India &apos;s list of misguided responses to terrorism is almost as long . 
Its Prevention of Terrorism Act ( POTA ) , enacted after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on America by the then ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) -led government , contains many of the features enshrined in the Patriot Act : an overly vague definition of what constitutes terrorism or unlawful acts , immunity from prosecution for law-enforcement or government agents , and expansion of wire-tapping . 
This law remained in effect until the current Congress Party-led government repealed it in 2004 . 
But the BJP may well win India &apos;s national elections next spring , and has pledged to bring back POTA , or something even more draconian . 
At the same time , in the face of an alarming increase in the number of terrorist attacks , Manmohan Singh &apos;s government has also indulged in a heavy-handed response to suspected Islamist terrorists , who are hauled off on flimsy evidence and killed before they can be convicted of any crime . 
Meanwhile , a commission that the government charged with investigating the state-condoned massacres of Muslim citizens in Gujarat in 2002 produced only a whitewash , absolving the perpetrators of any wrongdoing - and fueling a further rise in homegrown terrorism by deeply disaffected Indian Muslims . 
This sort of behavior has had terrible consequences for the moral credibility of democracy , for security in India , and for regional security in South Asia . 
The Obama administration should make as bold a break with the Bush administration &apos;s policy toward India as the Bush administration did with its predecessor by refocusing the relationship on tackling the real sources of insecurity . 
President Obama must shift the fundamental basis of the US-India relationship away from a strategic partnership based on a militarized notion of security toward a holistic vision of human security in which military force plays an appropriate but not a defining role . 
A new vision of the US-India relationship would focus on global warming , the collapse of industrial agriculture , the widening gap between rich and poor , the conventional and nuclear arms race in Asia , and the intensification of ethnic and religious conflict . 
The elements of a new Obama vision for the US-India relationship would be : an emergency joint task force to fast-track the development of sustainable solutions to meet India &apos;s and the world &apos;s burgeoning energy , water and food needs . 
It also should build a partnership for the elimination of nuclear weapons within a set time frame in which the US must take a leadership role . 
A vigorous new commitment to protecting the rights and freedoms of all citizens and residents and a zero-tolerance policy toward any state collusion with or tolerance of ethnic cleansing , torture , summary detention , citizen surveillance or other insults to democracy , is also necessary . 
A McCain presidency would have offered no hope for a radical break with the military swagger and crony capitalism of the Bush years , on which the bilateral relationship with India was built . 
For the sake of the future of the people of the world &apos;s oldest and largest democracies , let &apos;s hope that an Obama presidency fulfills this hope .
