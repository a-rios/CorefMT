Weimar 2013 ? 
NEW YORK - The worst crisis of capitalism since the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s has reawakened grim memories on both sides of the Atlantic . 
The ghost of Franklin Delano Roosevelt haunts Barack Obama &apos;s United States . 
Historical arguments over whether FDR &apos;s New Deal worked now form an important part of American debates over current monetary and fiscal policy in general , and the US Federal Reserve &apos;s policy of quantitative easing in particular . 
In Europe , where national economic failure once led to the collapse of democracy itself , people are now asking if it could happen again . 
Some see another Weimar moment , reminiscent of the belt-tightening and surging unemployment that characterized Heinrich Br√ºning &apos;s Germany and helped to bring the Nazis to power . 
At first sight , the reasons to dismiss this scenario seem overwhelming . 
If the European Union has done one thing , it is to make war between France and Germany unthinkable . 
Thus , the entire geopolitical context is far less threatening than it was in the 1930 &quot; s . 
Moreover , the ideological extremes that excited and polarized the continent back then are hardly in vogue today . 
Discredited by the collapse of the USSR and the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe , communism is effectively moribund , and its core constituencies - where communist parties manage to hang on - are aging and incapable of reproducing themselves . 
As for fascism , its political heirs in countries like Italy and France must contend with the stigma of the past . 
Vivid memories of total war and genocide , frequently revived , hinder any revival of the totalitarian parties of the right . 
This is also why we are unlikely to see the return of military regimes in southern Europe or anywhere else ; the suffering that they caused is too vivid in the collective memory . 
The last thing the Portuguese or Greek armies want to do is assume responsibility for governing . 
Then there is the most fundamental - and hence easily overlooked - difference of all . 
In the 1930 &quot; s , politics attracted the masses because people believed in the future . 
Millions marched for the great causes of the day , and hundreds of thousands joined political parties - often for life . 
Today &apos;s marches and demonstrations are a feeble reminder of those times , while parties everywhere are hemorrhaging members . 
But it would be rash to conclude that the interwar crisis has nothing to teach us . 
In the 1930 &quot; s , the US and Britain were among the few countries in the world where multi-party democracy survived . 
Almost everywhere else veered sharply to the right . 
In Germany and Italy , fascist parties came out on top , while elsewhere , dictators were backed by armies or kings . 
Analyzing these events much later , historians constructed elaborate typologies to distinguish between fascist and merely authoritarian regimes . 
But much more important was what the fascist and authoritarian regimes shared - all were beneficiaries of a sweeping collapse of the legitimacy of democratic politics . 
They all thereby indicated that democracy is not some kind of natural condition , nor some end-point of history whose stability and permanence can be taken for granted . 
On the contrary , democracy &apos;s strength lies not just in its character , but in its achievements as well . 
Its popularity can ebb quickly when it becomes associated with crippling and systemic failure , whether on the battlefield - as in France in 1940 - or in the corporate boardroom and on the factory floor . 
Those who doubt that this could happen again should consider the European country hardest hit in the current crisis - Greece . 
After the colonels &quot; junta there fell in 1974 , a democratic system sprang up . 
It is not doing so now . 
On the contrary , Greece &apos;s creditors - and its own politicians - have handled the crisis in a way that has thrown the entire constitutional achievement of the past four decades into doubt . 
Indeed , the political turmoil caused by the crisis has broken the back of the old two-party system . 
Between 2010 and 2012 , the center-left PASOK was in government , doing whatever it took to preserve Greece &apos;s membership of the euro and ward off formal default . 
The result was that its electoral support plunged from 44 % to 12 % . 
The entire center left is in flux , and new parties will probably come and go . 
The center-right New Democracy has also lost ground , though not as badly . 
But a new force has emerged on its flank : Golden Dawn , a frankly neo-Nazi party that is spreading violence on the streets and in public life , and seeing its popular support increase as a result . 
The catalyst of Golden Dawn &apos;s sudden rise is not Greece &apos;s large population of illegal immigrants - their presence predates the rightward shift by many years - but rather the massive rise in poverty and unemployment over the last three years and , above all , growing popular anger with the political class as a whole . 
In short , the crisis has produced a deep delegitimization of Greece &apos;s democratic politicians and their supposed achievements . 
This is not Weimar . 
What might replace democracy is another matter .
