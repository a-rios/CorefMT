The Lawless Sea 
SANTIAGO - The rule of law is almost entirely absent , with virtually no governance or policing . 
Illegal , unreported , and unregulated economic activities are common . 
The powerful seize non-renewable resources at the expense of the powerless . 
Environmental degradation is on the rise . 
That may sound like a description of a failed state , a desperately poor country beset by civil war , or a fictional dystopia . 
The vast region ( 45 % of the earth &apos;s total surface ) with next to no governance or rule of law is the high seas - nearly two-thirds of the global ocean that lies outside of any country &apos;s jurisdiction . 
How is this possible ? 
After all , there is the legally binding 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , which has been ratified by 166 states and the European Union . 
When UNCLOS was negotiated , the high seas were protected because they were inaccessible . 
Fishing vessels can now operate across the ocean , and deep-sea drilling provides a growing proportion of our oil and gas . 
UNCLOS has not kept pace with these developments . 
Industries and activities such as fisheries , shipping , and seabed mining are all regulated separately . 
No governance framework is in place for emerging high-seas industries such as energy production . 
Transparency and accountability are weak , and there is little enforcement of rules . 
Moreover , the authorities have limited power to intercept vessels suspected of illegal activity . 
As a result , international cooperation to counter illegal fishing , smuggling of weapons and drugs , human trafficking , piracy , and the use of vessels in terrorist operations has been greatly hampered . 
The consequences are dire . 
The ocean is our planet &apos;s life-support-system , keeping it healthy and productive . 
But overfishing and pollution are causing tremendous damage . 
Marine debris causes the death by drowning , suffocation , or starvation of some one million seabirds and around 100,000 marine mammals ( seals , whales , and dolphins ) every year , not to mention the hazard posed to shipping by sea junk . 
Plastic pollution - including pellets and micro plastics that enter food chains and can endanger human health - is a growing problem . 
Likewise , rising temperatures are reducing the ocean &apos;s oxygen-carrying capacity . 
The increasing uptake of carbon dioxide is causing ocean acidification and unprecedented changes in chemical and physical conditions , which in turn are affecting marine organisms and ecosystems . 
The very life of the global ocean is under threat . 
The time has come to bring the rule of law to the high seas . 
That is the purpose behind the Global Ocean Commission , an independent international body comprising former heads of state , ministers , and business leaders . 
I am one of the commissioners . 
Last week , we proposed a rescue package that offers eight proposals to improve governance and restore ocean health . 
To strengthen high-seas governance , the Global Ocean Commission is joining the call for a new agreement under UNCLOS to protect biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction . 
Less than 1 % of the high seas is currently protected , so it is crucial that this new agreement includes provisions for creating protected areas in the high seas . 
We are also proposing that an international convention be adopted to establish liability and compensation for both economic losses and ecological damage caused by offshore oil and gas exploration and production , which should also always be subject to legally binding safety protocols . 
Despite overfishing , a handful of countries - including the United States , Japan , and China , as well as the EU - are artificially supporting industrial high-seas fishing . 
Without subsidies , high-seas fisheries would not be financially viable . 
We are proposing that subsidies be capped immediately and eliminated within five years , and that countries be fully transparent about all fishing subsidies , about 60 % of which directly encourage unsustainable practices . 
Moreover , to eliminate illegal fishing , which strips our oceans of marine life , we are calling for mandatory identification numbers and the tracking of all high-seas fishing vessels , and a total ban on transshipment at sea . 
By closing loopholes , we will finally close our ports and markets to illegally obtained fish . 
An independent Global Ocean Accountability Board - the creation of which we are also proposing - should monitor progress on all of these fronts . 
In five years , if ocean decline continues and adequate prevention measures have not been implemented , the international community should consider turning the high seas - with the exception of those areas where action by regional fisheries management organizations is effective - into a regeneration zone where industrial fishing is forbidden . 
We can reverse ocean degradation , and turn the cycle of decline into a cycle of renewal . 
We know what needs to be done to restore ocean health , but we cannot do it alone . 
Delivering change will take political will and require joint efforts by governments , businesses , and civil society . 
It can and must be done .

The time to act is now . 
Unless we respond with strong governance and the necessary tools to enforce regulations , ruthless pirate fishing will continue with impunity , there will be no binding international safety standards for deep sea oil and gas drilling , and plastic pollution and abandoned fishing gear will continue to proliferate . 
The more the global ocean struggles for life , the more our children and future generations will struggle for theirs .
