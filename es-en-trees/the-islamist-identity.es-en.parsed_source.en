The Islamist Identity 
Everywhere you look nowadays , Islam is used ( and misused ) as a political force . 
Some Muslims employ it as a call to action ; many in the West ( and elsewhere ) perceive it as an &quot; other &quot; demanding containment and exclusion . 
As a Turk , I feel both sides of this debate directly . 
The reason that Islam seems like a religion of the &quot; other &quot; to Western eyes is that the West has witnessed a systematic de-institutionalization of religion . 
It is not religion that disappeared from modern Western life , of course , but rather the claims that religious institutions can make on individual behavior . 
Religion in the modern world is a much more personal and spiritual experience than ever before . 
Yet a process of de-institutionalization of religious experience is also taking place within Islam . 
Politicization of Islam is displacing the authority of Islam &apos;s religious classes , the ulema . 
As in the West , Islamic religious experience is becoming more personal . 
Interpretation of religious texts by individual Muslims , including political militants , intellectuals and women , is one result . 
Another is the vulgarization of religious knowledge , with the Koran &apos;s teachings abused and taken out of context to support political ends . 
Who now decides what is legitimate and what is illicit in Islam ? 
Who has the authority to interpret religious texts ? 
Who can issue a &quot; fatwa &quot; or declare &quot; jihad &quot; ? 
Nowadays , activism and terrorism provide , or rather impose , a new source of legitimacy . 
So lay people decide what Islam does and does not mean , without the authority of religious schools and specialized training . 
Indeed , Islam today is primarily interpreted through political actors and cultural movements , not religious institutions . 
This de-institutionalization has enabled Islam to move from being a local and national social bond to forging imaginary ties between all Muslims , everywhere , who feel oppressed or displaced . 
Thus , Islamism can unite adherents who previously were deeply divided : spiritual Sufi and canonized Shariat Muslims ; 
At the same time , Islam is on the move , with its believers leaving rural areas for cities , including the cities of the West . 
Many see this movement as something negative , emphasizing the fact that these people are socially uprooted , which leads to alienation and , for some , to terrorism . 
But social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern outlook . 
Of course , through migration Muslims experience a sense of distancing , if not an outright break , from their social origins . 
So their religious experience is of a new kind , bereft of theological , community , or state institutions . 
Religious experience instead becomes a form of social imagination within which they reconstruct a sense of belonging to Islam in new and strange surroundings . 
It is not distance from modern life , but proximity to it that triggers a return to religious identity . 
Indeed , most radicalism arises in groups who , by their experience of mobility and displacement , are acquainted with secular Western ways of political thinking and urban living . 
Disoriented by unfamiliar surroundings , Islam becomes their anchor . 
But for this anchor to work , Islam must be liberated from its traditionally subservient , passive and docile posture in the face of modernity . 
By wearing a veil or beard , claiming the right for places to pray at work or school , and demanding special foods , Muslims identify themselves overtly as Muslims . 
They are telling everyone around them that they are more zealous and meticulous in their religious observance than those who confine their religiosity to private life . 
For example , non-Muslims usually see veiling as a sign of the debasement and inferiority of Muslim women . 
From a stigma , however , it has become for Muslims a sign of their positive affirmation of an Islamic identity . 
Young Muslim women in Europe illustrate this transformation perfectly . 
Girls who adopt the headscarf in French and German schools are closer in many respects ( namely youth culture , fashion consciousness , and language ) to their classmates than to their homebound , uneducated mothers . 
In adopting the headscarf for Europe &apos;s public sphere , these girls are unintentionally altering the symbol and the role of Muslim women . 
This tendency extends deeper than headscarves . 
All Western Muslims possess a double sense of belonging , a double cultural capital . 
They define themselves through their religiosity , but they also have gained universal , secular knowledge . 
Because they have a double cultural capital , they can circulate relatively freely between different activities and spaces - home , school , youth associations , and urban leisure space . 
Being a Muslim and being an Islamist are not the same thing . 
What we are witnessing today is a shift from a Muslim identity to an Islamist identity . 
The religious self for individual Muslims is being shifted from the private to the public realm . 
The question for everyone is whether that search for identity can be satisfied with headscarves and wide public acceptance of Islamic religious practice , or if positive affirmation of Islam demands a more fundamental renunciation of modernity .
