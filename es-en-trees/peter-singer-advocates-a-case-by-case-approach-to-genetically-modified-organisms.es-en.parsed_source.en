A Clear Case for Golden Rice 
MELBOURNE - Greenpeace , the global environmental NGO , typically leads protests . 
Patrick Moore , a spokesperson for the protesters - and himself an early Greenpeace member - accused the organization of complicity in the deaths of two million children per year . 
He was referring to deaths resulting from vitamin A deficiency , which is common among children for whom rice is the staple food . 
These deaths could be prevented , Moore claims , by the use of &quot; golden rice , &quot; a form of the grain that has been genetically modified to have a higher beta carotene content than ordinary rice . 
Greenpeace , along with other organizations opposed to the use of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) , has campaigned against the introduction of beta carotene , which is converted in the human body into vitamin A. 
Moore &apos;s mortality figures seem to be on the high side , but there is no doubting the seriousness of vitamin A deficiency among children , especially in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia . 
According to the World Health Organization , it causes blindness in about 250,000-500,000 pre-school children every year , about half of whom die within 12 months . 
The deficiency also increases susceptibility to diseases like measles , still a significant cause of death in young children , although one that is declining as a result of vaccination . 
In some countries , lack of vitamin A is also a major factor in high rates of maternal mortality during pregnancy and childbirth . 
First developed 15 years ago by Swiss scientists , golden rice specifically addresses vitamin A deficiency , and the first field trials were conducted a decade ago . 
But it is still not available to farmers . 
Initially , there was a need to develop improved varieties that would thrive where they are most needed . 
Further field trials had to be carried out to meet the strict regulations governing the release of GMOs . 
That hurdle was raised higher when activists destroyed fields in the Philippines where trials were being conducted . 
Critics have suggested that golden rice is part of the biotech industry &apos;s plans to dominate agriculture worldwide . 
But , although the agribusiness giant Syngenta did assist in developing the genetically modified rice , the company has stated that it is not planning to commercialize it . 
Low-income farmers will own their seeds and be able to retain seed from their harvests . 
Indeed , Syngenta has given the right to sublicense the rice to a nonprofit organization called the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board . 
The board , which includes the two co-inventors , has the right to provide the rice to public research institutions and low-income farmers in developing countries for humanitarian use , as long as it does not charge more for it than the price for ordinary rice seeds . 
When genetically modified crops were first developed in the 1980 &quot; s , there were grounds for caution . 
Would these crops be safe to eat ? 
Might they not cross-pollinate with wild plants , passing on the special qualities they were given , such as resistance to pests , and so create new &quot; superweeds &quot; ? 
In the 1990 &quot; s , as a Senate candidate for the Australian Greens , I was among those who argued for strong regulations to prevent biotech companies putting our health , or that of the environment , at risk in order to increase their profits . 
Genetically modified crops are now grown on about one-tenth of the world &apos;s cropland , and none of the disastrous consequences that we Greens feared have come to pass . 
There is no reliable scientific evidence that GM foods cause illness , despite the fact that they receive much more intense scrutiny than more &quot; natural &quot; foods . 
( Natural foods can also pose health risks , as was shown recently by studies establishing that a popular type of cinnamon can cause liver damage . ) 
Although cross-pollination between GM crops and wild plants can occur , so far no new superweeds have emerged . 
We should be pleased about that - and perhaps the regulations that were introduced in response to the concerns expressed by environmental organizations played a role in that outcome . 
Regulations to protect the environment and the health of consumers should be maintained . 
Caution is reasonable . 
What needs to be rethought , however , is blanket opposition to the very idea of GMOs . 
With any innovation , risks need to be weighed against possible benefits . 
Where the benefits are minor , even a small risk may not be justified ; where those benefits are great , a more significant risk may well be worth taking . 
Regulations should , for instance , be sensitive to the difference between releasing a GM crop that is resistant to the herbicide glyphosate ( making it easier for farmers to control weeds ) and releasing GM crops that can resist drought and are suitable for drought-prone regions of low-income countries . 
Similarly , a GM crop that has the potential to prevent blindness in a half-million children would be worth growing even if it does involve some risks . 
The irony is that glyphosate-resistant crops are grown commercially on millions of hectares of land , whereas golden rice ( which has not been shown to pose any risk at all to human health or the environment ) still cannot be released . 
In some environmental circles , blanket opposition to GMOs is like taking a loyalty oath - dissidents are regarded as traitors in league with the evil biotech industry . 
It is time to move beyond such a narrowly ideological stance . 
Some GMOs may have a useful role to play in public health , and others in fighting the challenge of growing food in an era of climate change . 
We should consider the merits of each genetically modified plant on a case-by-case basis .
