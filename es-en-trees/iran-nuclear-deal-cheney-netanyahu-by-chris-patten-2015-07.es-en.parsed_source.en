A Belated Victory for Non-Proliferation 
LONDON - Let us give praise where it is richly deserved . 
Despite all the criticism they faced , US President Barack Obama and his Secretary of State , John Kerry , stuck doggedly to the task of negotiating a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program . 
Together with representatives of the United Kingdom , Russia , China , France , and Germany , they have now succeeded . 
The main terms of this historic agreement , concluded in the teeth of opposition from Israel , Iran &apos;s regional competitors ( particularly Saudi Arabia ) , and the political right in the United States , seek to rein in Iran &apos;s nuclear activities so that civil capacity cannot be swiftly weaponized . 
In exchange for inspection and monitoring of nuclear sites , the international economic sanctions imposed years ago on Iran will be lifted . 
This is a significant moment in the nuclear age . 
Since 1945 , the terrifying destructive force of nuclear weapons has encouraged political leaders to search for ways to control them . 
Not long after the destruction of Hiroshima , President Harry S. Truman , together with the Canadian and UK prime ministers , proposed the first non-proliferation plan ; all nuclear weapons would be eliminated , and nuclear technology for peaceful purposes would be shared and overseen by a United Nations agency . 
Truman &apos;s initiative subsequently went further , covering most of the non-proliferation issues that we still discuss today . 
But the proposals ran into outright opposition from Joseph Stalin , who would accept no limit to the Soviet Union &apos;s ability to develop its own nuclear weapons . 
So the nuclear arms race began , and in 1960 President John F. Kennedy warned that there would be 15 , 20 , or 25 nuclear states by the mid-1960s . 
&quot; I ask you , &quot; he said in 1963 , &quot; to stop and think for a moment what it would mean to have nuclear weapons in so many hands , in the hands of countries large and small , stable and unstable , responsible and irresponsible , scattered throughout the world . &quot; 
Two developments averted the nightmare of reckless nuclear proliferation . 
First , several countries capable of developing nuclear weapons concluded - in some cases , even after launching programs - that to do so would not increase their security . 
To their credit , South Africa and a number of Latin American countries took this route . 
Second , self-denial was greatly reinforced by the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , negotiated after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) . 
Since entering into force in 1968 , the NPT has been central to holding the line on the spread of nuclear weapons . 
Nowadays , apart from the original nuclear powers - the US , the UK , France , and Russia - the only other countries with these weapons are China , Israel , India , Pakistan , and North Korea . 
The Iran negotiations were vital to ensuring the integrity of the system . 
The danger , of course , was that Iran would move from developing civil nuclear power to making its own weapons . 
This would inevitably have caused other countries in the region , probably beginning with Saudi Arabia , to go the same way . 
There is an important lesson to be learned from more than a decade of negotiation with Iran . 
Iran &apos;s current president , Hassan Rouhani , was his country &apos;s chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005 . 
Iran &apos;s president at this time was the scholarly moderate Mohammed Khatami , with whom I at one time attempted to negotiate a trade and cooperation agreement on behalf of the European Union . 
Progress was stopped by disagreement over nuclear matters . 
Khatami &apos;s attempts to open a dialogue with the West fell on stony ground in President George W. Bush &apos;s Washington , and eventually he was replaced by the populist hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 
But in Rouhani &apos;s discussions on proliferation back then , Iran had offered the three EU countries with which it had begun negotiations a reasonable compromise : Iran would maintain a civil but not a military nuclear capacity . 
This would have capped the number of centrifuges at a low level , kept enrichment below the possibility of weaponization , and converted enriched uranium into benign forms of nuclear fuel . 
The British representative to the IAEA at this time , Ambassador Peter Jenkins , has said publicly that the negotiators from the EU were impressed by the Iranian offer . 
But the Bush administration pressured the UK government to veto a deal along these lines , arguing that more concessions could be extracted from the Iranians if they were squeezed harder and threatened with tougher sanctions and even a military response . 
We know how the Bush strategy turned out . 
The talks collapsed : no compromise , no agreement . 
Today , a deal has been concluded ; but it is less good than the deal that could have been reached a decade ago - a point worth keeping in mind as the likes of former Vice Present Dick Cheney and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu start hollering from the sidelines . 
As it is , not only will an agreement add cement to the NPT ; it could also open the way to the sort of understanding with Iran that is essential to any broad diplomatic moves to control and halt the violence sweeping across western Asia .
