An Agenda to Save the Euro 
NEW YORK - It has been three years since the outbreak of the euro crisis , and only an inveterate optimist would say that the worst is definitely over . 
Some , noting that the eurozone &apos;s double-dip recession has ended , conclude that the austerity medicine has worked . 
But try telling that to those in countries that are still in depression , with per capita GDP still below pre-2008 levels , unemployment rates above 20 % , and youth unemployment at more than 50 % . 
At the current pace of &quot; recovery , &quot; no return to normality can be expected until well into the next decade . 
A recent study by Federal Reserve economists concluded that America &apos;s protracted high unemployment will have serious adverse effects on GDP growth for years to come . 
If that is true in the United States , where unemployment is 40 % lower than in Europe , the prospects for European growth appear bleak indeed . 
What is needed , above all , is fundamental reform in the structure of the eurozone . 
By now , there is a fairly clear understanding of what is required : 
· A real banking union , with common supervision , common deposit insurance , and common resolution ; without this , money will continue to flow from the weakest countries to the strongest ; · Some form of debt mutualization , such as Eurobonds : with Europe &apos;s debt / GDP ratio lower than that of the US , the eurozone could borrow at negative real interest rates , as the US does . 
The lower interest rates would free money to stimulate the economy , breaking the crisis-hit countries &quot; vicious circle whereby austerity increases the debt burden , making debt less sustainable , by shrinking GDP ; · Industrial policies to enable the laggard countries to catch up ; this implies revising current strictures , which bar such policies as unacceptable interventions in free markets ; · A central bank that focuses not only on inflation , but also on growth , employment , and financial stability ; · Replacing anti-growth austerity policies with pro-growth policies focusing on investments in people , technology , and infrastructure . 
Much of the euro &apos;s design reflects the neoliberal economic doctrines that prevailed when the single currency was conceived . 
It was thought that keeping inflation low was necessary and almost sufficient for growth and stability ; that making central banks independent was the only way to ensure confidence in the monetary system ; that low debt and deficits would ensure economic convergence among member countries ; and that a single market , with money and people flowing freely , would ensure efficiency and stability . 
Each of these doctrines has proved to be wrong . 
The independent US and European central banks performed much more poorly in the run-up to the crisis than less independent banks in some leading emerging markets , because their focus on inflation distracted attention from the far more important problem of financial fragility . 
Likewise , Spain and Ireland had fiscal surpluses and low debt / GDP ratios before the crisis . 
The crisis caused the deficits and high debt , not the other way around , and the fiscal constraints that Europe has agreed will neither facilitate rapid recovery from this crisis nor prevent the next one . 
Finally , the free flow of people , like the free flow of money , seemed to make sense ; factors of production would go to where their returns were highest . 
But migration from crisis-hit countries , partly to avoid repaying legacy debts ( some of which were forced on these countries by the European Central Bank , which insisted that private losses be socialized ) , has been hollowing out the weaker economies . 
It can also result in a misallocation of labor . 
Internal devaluation - lowering domestic wages and prices - is no substitute for exchange-rate flexibility . 
Indeed , there is increasing worry about deflation , which increases leverage and the burden of debt levels that are already too high . 
If internal devaluation were a good substitute , the gold standard would not have been a problem in the Great Depression , and Argentina could have managed to keep the peso &apos;s peg to the dollar when its debt crisis erupted a decade ago . 
No country has ever restored prosperity through austerity . 
Historically , a few small countries were lucky to have exports fill the gap in aggregate demand as public expenditure contracted , enabling them to avoid austerity &apos;s depressing effects . 
But European exports have barely increased since 2008 ( despite the decline in wages in some countries , most notably Greece and Italy ) . 
With global growth so tepid , exports will not restore Europe and America to prosperity any time soon . 
Germany and some of the other northern European countries , demonstrating an unseemly lack of European solidarity , have declared that they should not be asked to pick up the bill for their profligate southern neighbors . 
This is wrong on several counts . 
For starters , lower interest rates that follow from Eurobonds or some similar mechanism would make the debt burden manageable . 
The US , it should be recalled , emerged from World War II with a very high debt burden , but the ensuing years marked the country &apos;s most rapid growth ever . 
If the eurozone adopts the program outlined above , there should be no need for Germany to pick up any tab . 
But under the perverse policies that Europe has adopted , one debt restructuring has been followed by another . 
If Germany and the other northern European countries continue to insist on pursuing current policies , they , together with their southern neighbors , will wind up paying a high price . 
The euro was supposed to bring growth , prosperity , and a sense of unity to Europe . 
Instead , it has brought stagnation , instability , and divisiveness . 
It does not have to be this way . 
The euro can be saved , but it will take more than fine speeches asserting a commitment to Europe . 
If Germany and others are not willing to do what it takes - if there is not enough solidarity to make the politics work - then the euro may have to be abandoned for the sake of salvaging the European project .
