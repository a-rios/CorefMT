A Clockwork Chemistry 
OXFORD - In Anthony Burgess &apos;s novella ( and Stanley Kubrick &apos;s film ) A Clockwork Orange , Alex , an unrepentant psychopath , has his eyes pried wide open and is forced to watch violent images . 
Like Pavlov &apos;s dog , Alex is being programmed to respond with nausea to violence and sex . 
This scene remains shocking , but , like most science fiction , it has aged . 
The behaviorist psychology it drew upon has long expired , and the fear that science will be used to make , or even force , people to be morally better now sounds old-fashioned . 
Science fiction ages fast , but it has a long afterlife . 
Over the past decade , an army of psychologists , neuroscientists , and evolutionary biologists has been busy trying to uncover the neural &quot; clockwork &quot; that underlies human morality . 
They have started to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social sentiments such as empathy , and have begun to uncover the genes that dispose some individuals to senseless violence and others to acts of altruism , and the pathways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions . 
And to understand how something works is also to begin to see ways to modify and even control it . 
Indeed , scientists have not only identified some of the brain pathways that shape our ethical decisions , but also chemical substances that modulate this neural activity . 
A recent study has shown that the anti-depressant Citalopram can change the responses of individuals to hypothetical moral dilemma scenarios . 
Individuals given the drug were less willing to sacrifice an individual to save the lives of several others . 
Another series of studies has shown that when the hormone oxytocin is administered via nasal spray , it increases trusting and cooperative behavior within social groups , but also decreases cooperation with those perceived as outsiders . 
Neuroscientists have even magnetically &quot; zapped &quot; carefully targeted areas of people &apos;s brains to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways - for example , making it easier for them to lie . 
Of course , no one is developing a &quot; moral pill &quot; that will transform us into saints . 
But the research is advancing fast , and it is almost certain to suggest new ways to reshape our moral intuitions , sentiments , and motivations . 
Should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human morality to try to make people morally better ? 
A Clockwork Orange was accused of glorifying violence , and some of its scenes are still hard to watch . 
But as Burgess himself argued , the novella has an almost Christian message : what makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil , and for society to crush individuals into servile conformity is as wicked as , and perhaps even worse than , the sadism of psychopaths like Alex . 
I suspect that many will agree with this view . 
Of course , most of us don &apos;t need to be conditioned to feel repulsed by rape or torture . 
But this does not mean that we are morally good , or good enough . 
As you read this , perfectly ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others . 
Even in the most advanced and affluent societies , a vast concentrated effort is needed to preserve even minimal decency : think of locks , security alarms , police , courts , and prisons . 
And it is doubtful that we really care enough about others , or give enough to the less fortunate . 
Humans are born with the capacity to be moral , but it is a limited capacity which is ill equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world . 
For thousands of years , humans have relied on education , persuasion , social institutions , and the threat of real ( or supernatural ) punishment to make people behave decently . 
We could all be morally better , but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further . 
It is not as if people would suddenly begin to behave better if we just gave them more facts and statistics , or better arguments . 
So we shouldn &apos;t be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science might help - in the first instance , by helping us design more effective institutions , more inspiring moral education , or more persuasive ethical arguments . 
But science might also offer more direct ways of influencing our brains . 
Science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible . 
It would be self-defeating , or worse , to try to promote morality through brutal coercion . 
Governments must not be given the power to control its citizens &quot; moral code - we know that if they had such power , they would misuse it . 
It would be ideal if individuals could freely explore different ways to improve themselves , whether by practicing mindfulness , reading moral philosophy , or , yes , by taking a &quot; morality &quot; pill . 
But it is also true that although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster , it is not so obvious that people would really want to take pills that would make them morally better . 
It is not clear that people really want to be morally better . 
And those who , like the psychopathic Alex , need the most help are probably those who would want it least . 
These are , of course , hypothetical questions . 
We don &apos;t yet know what is possible . 
And even if &quot; moral pills &quot; are just science fiction , they raise deep questions . 
Will we want to take them if they ever become available ? 
And what does it say about us if we won &apos;t ?
