Europe &apos;s Next Moral Hazard 
MUNICH - The euro crisis has passed through six phases so far . 
It is worth recalling them , because they show how policymakers stumbled along , trying to put out fires without keeping an eye on where their chosen path was leading them . 
Currently , markets remain calm , but this is only the beginning of a seventh phase of the crisis , during which Europe will become mired in debt . 
The sequence so far has been as follows : 
The limiting of creditors &quot; and investors &quot; liability to a mere 8 % of the balance-sheet total of banks in the context of Europe &apos;s new banking union - a measure aimed at ensuring more private international lending to stricken banks . 
The seventh phase of the crisis is one of enhanced moral hazard , stemming from a run-up in debt . 
With investment risks largely collectivized by the bailout measures instituted by the ECB and the eurozone &apos;s member governments , investors are once again accepting low yields , and borrowers are seizing the new opportunities . 
To be sure , in 2011 a so-called fiscal compact was agreed in order to avoid precisely this consequence . 
The compact , signed by all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic , obliges governments among other things to reduce their ( smoothed ) debt / GDP ratio annually by one-twentieth of the difference between the actual debt / GDP ratio and the Maastricht limit of 60 % . 
However , the exceptions foreseen in the compact have effectively removed theses constraints . 
Had the compact been enforced , Italy would have had to reduce its debt / GDP ratio from 121 % in 2011 to 112 % in 2014 . 
Instead , Italy &apos;s debt ratio has skyrocketed , with a forecast by the European Commission projecting it to reach 134 % at the end of this year . 
Likewise , Spain &apos;s debt ratio should have fallen from 71 % to 69 % , but will probably increase to 99 % . 
Greece &apos;s debt ratio will rise from 170 % to 177 % ( despite a 58-percentage-point debt-relief scheme in 2012 ) , Portugal &apos;s will surge from 108 % to 127 % , and France &apos;s will rise from 86 % to 96 % . 
Italy &apos;s new prime minister , Matteo Renzi , came to power on that platform . 
Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is trying to counter his leftist rival Alexis Tsipras in the same way . 
Portugal &apos;s Constitutional Court has thwarted the country &apos;s fiscal-consolidation efforts . 
And France &apos;s new prime minister , Manuel Valls , is also moving against austerity . 
Supposedly , everyone just wants more growth ; unfortunately , when politicians talk about growth , what they usually mean is that they should be permitted to incur more public debt . 
An increase in public debt causes a short-term surge in demand , helping to increase the degree of capacity utilization and keep unemployment in check . 
However , new debt is nothing but a form of dope , reducing pressure to take painful measures that would improve competitiveness and capacity growth . 
de facto debt mutualization that has prompted creditors to accept lower interest rates , and it is only lower interest rates that have permitted Renzi , Samaras , Valls , and the others to distance themselves from austerity policies . 
There is nothing surprising about this : When a decision-maker can claim full credit for a policy &apos;s benefits and collectivize the costs , he will pursue the policy sooner , more quickly , and to a larger extent than he would if he had to bear the costs alone . 
What is remarkable is how matter-of-factly Europe &apos;s transgressors succeed in cloaking themselves with the mantle of a new social breakthrough . 
One only needs to look at the United States to see how dangerous - and indeed unsustainable - the eurozone &apos;s path has become . 
When one of the US states runs up too much debt , creditors become jittery and austerity measures are introduced to avert the risk of bankruptcy - as has happened in the past few years in California , Illinois , and Minnesota . 
But all of that occurs while the debt / GDP ratio is still minimal and clearly below 10 % , because creditors know that no one will come to their aid . 
The Federal Reserve will not buy their government bonds , and the federal authorities will not issue any guarantees . 
In Europe , by contrast , easy access to the local printing presses before and after the foundation of the ECB , together with the new fiscal rescue mechanisms , ensure that investors start to become nervous only when debt ratios are 10-20 times as high . 
As a result , the debt level rises until it spirals out of control . 
The critical limit beyond which creditors become anxious has been raised significantly by the bailout architecture put in place over the last two years . 
This will bring a few years of calm as debt levels climb steadily to that limit . 
Then the storm will come , battering ordinary citizens , while today &apos;s leaders remain high and dry , drawing pensions .
