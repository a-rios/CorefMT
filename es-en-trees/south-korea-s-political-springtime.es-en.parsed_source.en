South Korea &apos;s Political Springtime 
SEOUL - The ascension to power of the pudgy 29-year-old Kim Jong-un in North Korea has grabbed headlines around the world , but the most important story involving Korean young people and politics is taking place in the South . 
There , young voters are becoming angrier , more politically active , and increasingly hostile to the old established parties . 
This demographic challenge to South Korea &apos;s status quo suggests a &quot; liberal &quot; awakening that could completely alter the country &apos;s political landscape . 
The election last autumn of the activist Park Won-soon as mayor of Seoul demonstrated the growing strength of the youth vote , which took the ruling Grand National Party completely by surprise . 
Young people mobilized themselves spontaneously , using all the tools of social networking and modern communications , to turn out not only voters their own age , but countless others exasperated with South Korea &apos;s rigidity and insulated opportunities . 
The sudden surge in young voters has called into question the long-presumed victory of the governing GNP &apos;s likely candidate , Park Guen-hye , in the presidential election due to be held in December . 
Indeed , many political analysts now regard the GNP as a sinking ship , particularly after a staffer to one of the party &apos;s MPs allegedly masterminded a cyber-attack on the National Election Commission &apos;s Web site to prevent young voters from getting to the polls . 
While some pundits and politicians now suggest that the GNP could collapse sooner than corrupt and poverty-stricken North Korea , Park Geun-hye , an iconic woman in South Korean politics , has made it clear that she will not abandon the GNP . 
To further highlight her resolve , Park became the GNP &apos;s interim leader last month . 
In Park &apos;s eyes , abandoning the GNP simply because of the party &apos;s deepening unpopularity would show her to lack principles and trustworthiness . 
Her refusal to strike out on her own is probably the main reason why she continues to lead various opinion polls . 
Nevertheless , recent polls show that a majority of voters distrust the incumbent government and the ruling party . 
Indeed , Ahn Cheol-soo , a successful entrepreneur turned pro-reform professor at Seoul National University and the main backer of the city &apos;s new mayor , has now rocked South Korean politics by dropping broad hints that he might become a presidential candidate . 
Ahn has already become a lightning rod for all of the country &apos;s anti-Park and anti-President Lee Myun-bak forces , attracting young people as well . 
Ahn &apos;s most obvious merits are his personal history of overcoming severe challenges and his modest demeanor . 
His signature commercial achievement - the development of anti-virus software - made him immensely wealthy . 
His decision to give away a large portion of his fortune has made him immensely popular . 
More importantly , Ahn knows how to talk to people who are frustrated by South Korea &apos;s rigid economy and business environment , particularly South Korean youth . 
He also seems cognizant of the growing power of social networking in politics . 
Although the 49-year-old professor remains formally uncommitted to running for office , his frankness and tolerance aids his ability to communicate a clear political message of the need for fundamental change . 
Rarely in South Korean politics has a candidate &apos;s personality played so important a role . 
Ahn &apos;s economic beliefs , formed mainly by his experiences as a CEO fighting against the entrenched power of South Korea &apos;s chaebol ( vast , politically well-connected industrial conglomerates ) , has rekindled a debate on both the right and the left about whether the chaebol are still capable of leading the country &apos;s economy effectively . 
In an era of growing inequality and joblessness , Ahn &apos;s criticism of the chaebol is both smart economics and smart politics . 
Economically frustrated youth welcome Ahn with loud cheers wherever he appears , because he expresses their anxiety that the chaebol are stifling new companies that could create much-needed jobs . 
One big obstacle that Ahn will face if he decides to run is the need to organize a political party , or else to forge a coalition among South Korea &apos;s fractured opposition parties . 
Neither is an easy task , and the precedent of incompetence established by Japan &apos;s Democratic Party since it defeated the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party may make some South Korean voters reluctant to abandon the familiar and battle-tested GNP . 
But , despite these worries , it is difficult to imagine that Ahn would stand aside this April while voters &quot; demand for him continues to soar . 
The near-certainty that Ahn will join the fray is not good news for the already-unstable GNP , especially for Park . 
In one of her very rare appearances on a popular television talk show on January 2 , she called Ahn &quot; a very popular professor with young people . &quot; 
Indeed , while she acknowledged that young men and women have &quot; rebelled &quot; against the established parties , Ahn supposedly spurred them to do so through a series of lectures called &quot; Youth Concert . &quot; 
While the &quot; Ice Princess , &quot; as Park is nicknamed , will undoubtedly retain her core voters , more than 20 million South Koreans now access Twitter or Facebook on their cellphones , and follow politics on them . 
These are new or disenchanted voters ; how they vote in April - and how many of their fellow citizens follow their lead - will determine whether South Korea has its own political spring .
