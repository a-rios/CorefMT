A Greek Catch-22 
BUENOS AIRES - Desperate times bring desperate measures . 
The latest package to cope with Greece &apos;s insolvency offers a bond buyback to lighten the country &apos;s debt burden . 
In essence , this is a back-door debt restructuring : Europe &apos;s bailout fund , the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) would lend the money for Greece to buy back its own debt in the secondary market at deep discounts , thereby imposing a loss on private bondholders without the need to declare a default . 
A recurrent characteristic of Europe &apos;s debt-crisis debate is a Latin American precedent . 
Indeed , many highly indebted countries in Latin America conducted similar debt buybacks in the late 1980 &quot; s . 
Bolivia &apos;s 1988 buyback of close to half of its defaulted sovereign debt , an operation funded by international donors , is a classic example . 
But the most relevant Latin American experience with debt buybacks is a more recent and far less studied case : Ecuador in 2008 . 
President Rafael Correa had been toying with default since the 2006 presidential campaign ( debt repudiation was part of his platform ) , and quickly earned a CCC rating from Fitch . 
The reasons invoked by Correa ( legal concerns about how the bonds were issued in the 2000 debt exchange ) were beside the point . 
The default threat was a way to depress bond prices in secondary markets , only to buy them back at a discount through the back door . 
That task was outsourced to Banco del Pacífico , which bought the soon-to-be-defaulted Ecuadorian paper at 20 cents on the dollar and above - a level low enough for a deep haircut but high enough to fend off &quot; vulture &quot; investors . 
To speed things up , after the default was declared in December 2008 , Ecuador completed the buyback with an inverse auction for the remaining bondholders , to be settled in cash - rather than a regular exchange in which the legality of undercover purchases was likely to be questioned . 
With the larger part of the outstanding stock in friendly hands , and institutional bondholders pressed to liquidate their positions in the midst of the post-Lehman Brothers selloff , the operation was a success . 
This episode offers a few preliminary lessons on debt buybacks . 
The first concerns the market response . 
Judging from the recent evolution of Ecuadorian bond yields , it appears that markets have not punished Ecuador &apos;s behavior : Ecuador , an oil exporter blessed by the 2009 recovery in oil prices , could have returned to the capital markets shortly after the exchange . 
This is particularly notable , given that Ecuador &apos;s was perhaps the first opportunistic default ( triggered by unwillingness , rather than inability , to pay ) in recent history . 
The second lesson , and the one most pertinent to Europe now , concerns the crucial role played by the default scenario . 
Indeed , almost two years of default threats by Correa were not enough to elicit a deep discount . 
Ecuador needed to go all the way to a &quot; credit event &quot; in December 2008 to be able to purchase the bonds at bargain prices . 
The premise that only a credible default ensures significant private-sector involvement ( that is , that private bondholders take a real hit ) is apparent when we compare the market-friendly Uruguayan debt exchange in 2003 with the draconian Argentine restructuring of 2005 . 
In Uruguay , what the authorities presented as a voluntary transaction produced no nominal haircuts and only minor debt relief ; in Argentina , a four-year debt moratorium was essential to achieving nominal haircuts above 50 % . 
So the question arises : how are private bondholders to be convinced to get rid of their Greek bonds at a loss if there is a credible buyer of last resort ? 
If Europe credibly volunteered funds to buy back all Greek debt , the Greek risk premium would disappear and private investors would be fully bailed out . 
Only the probability of a default - and the goal of avoiding even deeper haircuts - can induce investors to liquidate their positions at a discount . 
But the buyback can succeed only if the market perceives it as the last chance before a unilateral debt restructuring . 
In other words , a successful buyback is a preamble to default . 
Can Greece , with the EFSF &apos;s help , obtain debt relief while avoiding default ? 
Small purchases at current panic prices , vulture-fund style , are always possible , but they do not promise substantial debt relief . 
Large purchases would drive up prices in the secondary market , defeating the point of the whole operation . 
And the opaque Ecuadorian methods are not possible in Europe , both for legal reasons and because a transaction of this size could hardly be disguised or outsourced . 
But what if the EFSF were to mimic Banco del Pacífico in a transparent way , say , by setting a threshold spread level above which it would fund buy-backs of any Greek bond in the market ? 
Naturally , the spread would automatically converge to the threshold , but how much would be sold ? 
Would the EFSF be retiring Greek debt at bargain prices or would it be providing insurance to current bondholders ? 
If the threshold spread is set reasonably high in order to achieve a significant discount , the stock of debt retired by the buyback would be marginal . 
After all , by capping spreads , the buyback facility would limit the downside risk while providing incentives to hold the bonds and wait for the upside - a good reason , perhaps , to make the facility a temporary offer . 
By contrast , if the threshold is set low enough to bring spreads down from panic levels , purchases will be more substantive , but at the expense of reducing considerably the effective haircut on private holders . 
A debt buyback is something of a Catch 22 : to succeed in inducing a haircut , it needs to profit from the default fears that it intends to alleviate . 
Without Ecuador &apos;s gimmicks , buybacks do not seem to be the solution to Greece &apos;s debt overhang .
