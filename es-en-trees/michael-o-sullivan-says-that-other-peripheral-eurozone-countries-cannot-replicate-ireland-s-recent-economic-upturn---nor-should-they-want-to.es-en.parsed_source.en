Ireland &apos;s Model Crisis 
DUBLIN - Ireland has now left the clutches of the bailout-for-austerity framework established by the Troika ( the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund ) for indebted eurozone countries , and is leading the monetary union &apos;s economic recovery . 
European policymakers , including Jean-Claude Trichet , the ECB &apos;s former president , have suggested that Ireland &apos;s dogged commitment to austerity is a model for others . 
Really ? 
It was not long ago that Ireland &apos;s economic miracle was also seen as a model - what the Economist in 1997 hailed as &quot; Europe &apos;s shining light &quot; - attracting admirers as diverse and distant as China and Israel . 
Then , Ireland became a model for how not to manage a property bubble and , subsequently , a banking crisis . 
Although exiting the Troika program is undoubtedly a success , especially when compared with the country &apos;s wretched outlook in late 2010 , no one should aspire to what Ireland has been through . 
Most Irish citizens would also reject the notion that their country has been austerity &apos;s model patient . 
The fact that the country has again become fashionable reflects the confusion in eurozone policymakers &quot; economic thinking and the folly of imitation across think tanks and international institutions . 
A bona fide socioeconomic model should be built around an ingrained &quot; way of doing things &quot; - indeed , so ingrained that the model , like the vaunted Nordic one , is almost impossible to replicate elsewhere . 
Ireland &apos;s &quot; way of doing things &quot; has hardly changed , despite the crisis . 
Political and institutional reform has not matched changes in people &apos;s lifestyles ; accountability in public life continues to be frustratingly weak . 
Nonetheless , some lessons can be drawn from Ireland &apos;s recent experience . 
Unlike the European Union &apos;s other periphery countries , Ireland established a political consensus around the need for austerity , and repeated this message continuously , at home and abroad . 
Like Chile during Latin America &apos;s period of financial volatility , Ireland &apos;s crisis management was generally good , and high-quality outward-facing institutions , ( such as the Industrial Development Authority and the National Treasury Management Agency ) presented a consistent and positive image to the world . 
But Ireland needs to do more . 
In particular , it needs to focus on how the banking crisis has affected the economy &apos;s long-term growth potential , on how the nature and structure of the banking system needs to be changed , on local businesses &quot; ability to adapt in a credit crunch , and on the mounting social costs of austerity . 
The political lesson Ireland &apos;s leaders have taken from the bailout experience is that loyalty to the status quo , rather than a combination of truth-seeking and radical action , is the best way forward . 
While resoluteness can be commendable , a &quot; head-down , maul forward &quot; policy , to use rugby parlance , brings other risks . 
First , although Europe might be able to scrape through the current crisis on austerity alone , it would be left ill-equipped to address deeper structural shortcomings , to say nothing of making progress on fiscal , banking , and political union . 
Moreover , there is a risk that some will conflate the view that &quot; loyalty works &quot; with the idea that &quot; austerity &quot; works . 
How , for example , can we disentangle the impact of austerity from that of the colossal spending undertaken by ECB President Mario Draghi ? 
Will we be able to claim that austerity was a success if , for example , a large eurozone economy like France fails to grow ? 
A low-risk approach may have helped pull Ireland through the Troika program . 
But would it also galvanize the country sufficiently to reshape its banking industry , restore a failing health-care system , or repair the social damage wrought in towns across Ireland ? 
In business , risk-taking - and its close relation , innovation - cannot be imported . 
Some things must be homegrown .
