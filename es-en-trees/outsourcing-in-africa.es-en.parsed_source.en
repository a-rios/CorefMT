Outsourcing in Africa 
In the past 40 years , advanced computers and communications have transformed one part of the world after another - first , the US and Europe , then Japan , Korea , and Taiwan , and most recently , India , China , and Eastern Europe . 
Is Africa next ? 
Despite civil wars , malnutrition , and the anguish of the AIDS epidemic , something remarkable is happening in black Africa : the stealthy rise of a high-technology sector . 
If not quite representing an African &quot; Silicon Valley , &quot; these shoots of high-tech industry nonetheless can and must be nurtured if Africa is to thrive . 
Consider what is happening on several floors of a single high-rise office building in Accra , Ghana &apos;s capital . 
There some 1,500 Africans process American health-insurance claims - working around the clock , in three shifts . 
The Africans speak English , type at least 50 words a minute on a computer , take data from paper claim forms supplied by US health insurers via satellite in electronic form , put it into new digital forms , and ship them back to the US . 
Ghana is best known for producing cocoa and gold , but today Affiliated Computer Services ( ACS ) , a Texas company that runs the outsourcing operation , is the country &apos;s largest private employer . 
African &quot; key punchers &quot; earn $ 4 to $ 5 a day - four times the legal minimum wage - and receive health insurance , meals , and subsidized transport . 
A small number of African engineers and professionals earn much more , and receive periodic training in advanced technologies . 
ACS &apos;s employees are but the first Africans to benefit from the hottest trend in the global economy : outsourcing , or the shift of service jobs from high-wage to low-wage countries . 
To be sure , the number of jobs moving to Africa is tiny compared to those going to Asia , Latin America , and Eastern Europe . 
But the big news is that Africa is finally competing in the economic contest that is reshaping the world economy . 
Still , Africa remains burdened by severe disadvantages , not the least of which is a terrible image . 
&quot; Big corporations don &apos;t even have Africa on the map when they consider outsourcing locations , &quot; says Sambou Makalou , a native of Mali who tries to persuade US employers to shift service jobs to Africa . 
&quot; There are real opportunities for outsourcing to Africa , &quot; he says , &quot; but there are barriers , too . &quot; 
African governments also must be willing to start small : expend a lot of effort to attract pilot projects in the hope of larger employment in the future . 
With sensible reforms , many barriers can be removed or at least eased . 
Start with the following : 
· Better Governance : African governments often boast when they simply stop the corrosive effects of corruption and irrational business regulation . 
But little attention is given to the high cost of telecommunications , unreliable electrical-power systems , and the poor transport infrastructure . 
• Greater Competitiveness : African leaders have been slow to realize that they must woo foreign corporations with special services , training programs for workers , and even subsidized offices . 
Asian countries attract many jobs by creating &quot; industrial parks , &quot; with more reliable services , including ultra-reliable communications networks , offered at competitive prices . 
By restructuring their secondary schools and universities to train graduates with skills demanded by multinational corporations , Asian countries also create more competitive workforces . 
To be sure , Africa is a far better place to do business than five years ago . 
The spread of mobile telephony has revolutionized ordinary life in a continent with the world &apos;s lowest penetration of fixed-line telephones . 
Satellite links have vastly improved Internet access , and a new undersea cable that runs along the coast of Africa ( SAT-3 ) promises to improve and reduce the cost of all types of communications . 
The problem is that , although Africa &apos;s economic appeal is increasing , India and China are improving more quickly , widening the gap . 
African cities are increasingly finding their way onto the short lists of corporate location experts , only to lose out to Asian cities . 
Africans can start winning only if they move faster . 
Surprisingly , wage competitiveness is a problem . 
Although Africa is the world &apos;s poorest region on average , wages in the formal economy generally exceed those paid in China and India , where government keeps basic food , housing , and transport costs relatively low through subsidies and controls . 
In urban Africa , costs - for food and transport in particular - are relatively high , which forces wages up . 
The supply of African professionals and skilled workers , meanwhile , is tight ; shortages also drive up wages . 
Indeed , an Indian software programmer typically earns less than a comparable African programmer . 
Even wages for routine data-entry tasks in Africa are usually no less than those paid in south Asia . 
The odds that Africa one day will receive a fair share of outsourcing jobs are improving . 
When ACS decided to expand recently , it opened a new operation in India rather than in Ghana or another African country . 
The message was sobering . 
Even as hundreds of similar outsourcing centers spring up in Asia , Eastern Europe , and Latin America , the Accra center remains a rarity in Africa . 
That is a shame , but it need not be Africa &apos;s fate .
