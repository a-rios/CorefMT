The Climate Countdown 
LONDON - It seems to have become a ritual for United Nations climate negotiations to reach the brink of collapse before an intense , contentious compromise is achieved after the deadline . 
But the torturous conclusion to this year &apos;s talks in Doha - in which nearly 200 countries agreed to extend the Kyoto protocol - has merely set the stage for more dramatic negotiations in 2015 , when a new comprehensive agreement must be reached . 
The just-concluded deal establishes a bridge between the old climate regime and a new , as-yet-undefined one . 
By extending the Kyoto Protocol - which limits some developed countries &quot; greenhouse-gas emissions - for another eight years , the Doha agreement preserves the vital framework of international law and retains hard-won accounting rules for emissions allowances and trading between countries . 
But the deal also confirms that , in 2020 , Kyoto will be replaced by a new treaty , which will discard the outdated binary distinction between &quot; developed &quot; and &quot; developing &quot; countries . 
The decision in Doha reaffirms that any new agreement must bolster efforts to meet the UN target of limiting global warming to two degrees centigrade . 
Indeed , it will spur a review of countries &quot; emissions targets , aimed at closing the gap between current pledges and the reductions needed to remain below the two-degree threshold . 
The deal also creates a new mechanism to compensate the countries that are suffering the most as a result of climate change . 
Moreover , a single negotiation platform has been established , and a 2015 deadline for concluding a new agreement has been set - a much more significant accomplishment than most commentators or governments have recognized . 
The last UN climate-change conference took place in Copenhagen in December 2009 . 
As a result , the talks were transformed into a full-blown leaders &quot; summit , with presidents and prime ministers heading to Denmark to seal the deal themselves . 
But the talks failed to deliver a comprehensive , legally binding agreement , causing investors to lose confidence in a low-carbon economy and delaying progress by several years . 
Many fear a similar outcome in 2015 , given that conditions seem even less conducive to agreement . 
Preoccupied by crisis , the world &apos;s leading economies seem unwilling to make significant new emissions-reduction commitments . 
And public anxiety about employment and living standards has replaced the fears about global warming that inspired the 2009 movement . 
Environmental NGOs worry that raising expectations could worsen the fallout from failure , damaging efforts at the national level to build low-carbon economies . 
But this threatens to become a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
Although political leaders are not focused on climate change , a big international event can capture their attention , as the Copenhagen conference did . 
And next year , when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change begins publishing its latest assessment of the scientific evidence , the prospect of runaway climate change is bound to mobilize civil society . 
In fact , the current situation , characterized by rising global greenhouse-gas emissions , already amounts to failure , with the current trend putting the two-degree target out of reach in less than a decade . 
The only hope is an international movement for immediate action , such as that which , in advance of the Copenhagen conference , compelled the world &apos;s largest carbon emitters - including the United States and China - to set emissions targets . 
Indeed , the Copenhagen experience offers some valuable lessons . 
First , given that countries make international commitments only when their citizens are ready to do so , increasing domestic pressure for emissions reduction is crucial . 
Every major economy must recognize that investment in &quot; green growth &quot; can create jobs and bolster economic development . 
Moreover , combating climate change must again become a moral crusade , which entails appealing to people &apos;s emotions . 
After all , crossing that two-degree threshold implies condemning future generations to global warming &apos;s most devastating consequences . 
Third , developing countries should lead the debate over a new global agreement , in order to ensure equity and protect their right to develop . 
Climate action should be viewed as a means to improve the well-being of the world &apos;s poorest people - those who most need an agreement - rather than as a burden . 
Finally , the involvement of heads of state and government must complement the UN process , rather than supplant it . 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for a leader &apos;s summit on climate change in 2014 ; that summit must now become the focus of public pressure to move toward an agreement in 2015 . 
The path to an international agreement strong enough to keep global warming under two degrees will be fraught with obstacles . 
But , if citizens ratchet up the pressure on their leaders , and policymakers demonstrate vision and leadership , the route can be navigated . 
The countdown to 2015 has begun .
