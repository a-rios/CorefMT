From Neoliberalism to No Liberalism ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - The era of free-market capitalism launched in the 1980 &quot; s by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan - often called &quot; neoliberalism &quot; by its opponents - is over . 
This ideological wave has crashed with the ongoing financial market crisis , but its decline was a long time coming . 
In the last few years , while American leaders continued to ride the neoliberal wave , much of the rest of the world was already standing on the shore . 
Disenchantment with &quot; neoliberal , &quot; pro-market ideas began in developing countries that had once been their ardent admirers . 
Latin American countries that embraced free-market policies in the 1990 &quot; s rejected them in the mid-2000 &quot; s , as a new wave of left-leaning leaders came to power . 
Russia , which adopted market-oriented reforms in the 1990 &quot; s , moved to a managed form of state capitalism in the 2000 &quot; s with &quot; oligarchs &quot; forced to submit to state control . 
As a result , the United States , the European Commission , and the multilateral development banks have become increasingly isolated in their efforts to advance free-market thought and policies worldwide . 
The deepening financial crisis weakens their position further . 
After all , how can the US or the Western multilateral institutions advocate bank privatization now ? 
The decline of free-market orthodoxy in the rest of the world was caused by two factors : its failures as an approach to economic policy and the decline of US prestige and &quot; soft power . &quot; 
&quot; Neoliberalism &quot; grew in popularity as a result of its successes in jump-starting economic growth in the US , the United Kingdom , and some developing countries in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
However , its weaknesses also became apparent during the mid- to late-1990 &quot; s . 
The attempt to implant free-market philosophy in Russia , for instance , proved catastrophic . 
Whereas the Russian experience clearly demonstrated the importance of strong state institutions in regulating a market economy , the free-market model &apos;s fierce ideological opposition to a large state role in the economy offered a poor guide to building them . 
After some successes , most notably in Chile , &quot; neoliberal &quot; advice in Latin America also failed , most dramatically in the case of Argentina &apos;s currency board , but most damagingly by increasing inequality , which worsened the continent &apos;s central political-economic problem . 
In Brazil , President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva showed that significant departures from free-market prescriptions worked better . 
Worldwide , most of the high-growth countries of the 1990 &quot; s and 2000 &quot; s broke with free-market orthodoxy by maintaining a stronger state hand in the economy . 
Belief in &quot; neoliberalism &quot; also was based on the success of the US economy , which for much of the 1990 &quot; s seemed to demonstrate the superiority of free markets . 
But the rapid decline of US prestige and &quot; soft power &quot; during the 2000 &quot; s sowed doubt outside the US . 
As the global agenda shifted to concerns about global warming , inequality , and the stability of the international system , the US no longer seemed to be a shining example , but rather an immovable obstacle on many of these issues . 
America &apos;s elites turned a blind eye to these developments , rejecting all criticism , together with the crude anti-Americanism with which it was often expressed . 
Today , the story is different . 
A massive reassessment is finally in progress , with US elites now recognizing that market capitalism is in crisis , and that the world will not blindly follow their lead . 
But that leaves some large questions unresolved . 
If &quot; neoliberalism &quot; has failed , what comes next ? 
And what must the US do to regain its stature and influence in the international economy ? 
As New York and London lose their undisputed claim to being the world &apos;s financial capitals , the rising centers of the global economy will gain an increasing say in international economic policy . 
Most , if not all , are located in countries that have a stronger tradition of state involvement in the economy . 
Jeffrey Garten , the dean of Yale &apos;s School of Management , got it right when he labeled this the era of &quot; state capitalism . &quot; 
The state is on its way back as an economic player - not least in the US . 
But is that a good thing ? 
While many critics will be tempted to celebrate the end of &quot; neoliberalism , &quot; it remains to be seen whether or not what succeeds it represents an improvement . 
Various forms of statism have been tried before ; all have been found lacking . 
After all , while &quot; neoliberalism &quot; was criticized as technocratic and elitist , it was nonetheless a form of liberalism , and it was also consistent with the spread of democratic governance worldwide . 
The new era may not be so propitious for political liberties . 
As rising authoritarian powers , China or Russia , for example , have no reason to use their growing international influence to promote democracy ; on the contrary , they increasingly counterbalance the efforts of Western countries to promote political liberty . 
As statist models of economic development become more appealing , democratic governance will become less so . 
Nor is it clear that &quot; state capitalism &quot; can generate the same degree of innovation and entrepreneurship as the liberal models did in their prime . 
In order to redeem the liberal project , American and European leaders will need to reformulate it in such a way that it can provide convincing solutions to problems such as environmental degradation and economic inequality . 
This will be no easy task , and one that may be far from policymakers &quot; minds as they grapple with the current crisis . 
But , unless they do , the emphasis on economic and political freedom that lies at the heart of liberalism may not survive .
