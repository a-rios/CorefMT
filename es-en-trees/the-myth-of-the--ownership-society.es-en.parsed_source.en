The Myth of the &quot; Ownership Society &quot; 
&quot; No , &quot; said former Fox News journalist Tony Snow , newly appointed as one of George W. Bush &apos;s closest aides , his Press Secretary , when asked recently about his retirement savings . 
&quot; As a matter of fact , I was even too dopey to get in on a 401 ( k ) . 
So there is actually no Fox pension . 
The only media pension I have is through AFTRA . &quot; 
A 401 ( k ) is a heavily tax-favored account in which workers can save money for their retirement . 
Typically , employers - including Fox News - match workers &quot; 401 ( k ) contributions , so setting up a 401 ( k ) is an irresistible financial deal , a true no-brainer . 
Yet Tony Snow didn &apos;t . 
Only the union he was forced to join , the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists , has been doing any formal saving and earmarking of his retirement assets . 
Snow &apos;s case , I think , holds very important lessons , and not just for the United States . 
To the extent that the Bush administration has a coherent philosophy for domestic policy , it is the idea of the &quot; ownership society &quot; - the belief that intermediary institutions , whether governments , unions , or the benefits departments of companies , should get out of the business of providing social insurance . 
Instead , individuals should rely on their own assets to provide them with financial security in retirement or in case of serious illness . 
Give people the incentives to plan for their future , ownership-society advocates argue , and they will . 
In the future , Snow will have to stand up at the podium in the White House briefing room and advocate the various components of Bush &apos;s ownership-society proposals . 
He will have to praise Health Security Accounts - and argue that people won &apos;t stop going to the doctor for preventive care even if their HSA-tied insurance plan doesn &apos;t pick up any of the bills . 
He will have to praise privatization of Social Security - and argue that individuals will make prudent and wise investment decisions with this baseline tranche of their potential retirement resources . 
And he will have to praise the decline of unions and the shedding of benefits by firms - and argue that individuals will make better choices than union experts or firms &quot; benefit departments . 
The assembled reporters will look at him , and they will recall that when he was offered an unbelievably good financial deal , he was too &quot; dopey &quot; to take advantage of it . 
And they might reasonably conclude that his failure to channel some of his Fox News salary into a 401 ( k ) account is a very powerful argument against the words coming out of his mouth . 
This is not to say that the issues are simple or that there are easy answers . 
America has many people who do not set up 401 ( k ) accounts , despite enormous incentives to do so . 
It also has people who do set up 401 ( k ) accounts and then invest them badly - for example , Enron workers whose 401 ( k ) money was overwhelmingly invested in company stock lost not only their jobs when the company went bankrupt , but also their pension assets . 
There are also well-known examples of highly corrupt union pension funds , such as the one bilked for years by the leadership of the Teamsters . 
Finally , there is the example of politicians like George W. Bush , who enacted a government program that promises comprehensive drug benefits to the elderly and mammoth profits to pharmaceutical companies . 
His administration may preach the virtues of individual responsibility , but its program makes no provision for how and where the government is going to secure the resources needed to finance its promises . 
In short , there are psychological and moral failures at all levels - individuals , firms , unions , insurance companies , and governments . 
Difficult problems of institutional design compound the difficulty of reforming social-welfare programs . 
America must also deal with the potential for corruption , both illegal in the case of the diversion of Teamsters &quot; pension resources and legal in the campaign contributions provided by the pharmaceutical lobby to complaisant members of Congress . 
These problems are not America &apos;s alone , for they are inherent to all efforts to privatize social welfare . 
As Americans and others look at this Gordian knot of public policy problems , we should learn one thing from the example of Tony Snow : the vision of an &quot; ownership society &quot; espoused by Bush is simply not plausible . 
If it were , his new press secretary would not be describing himself as &quot; dopey . &quot;
