New Rules for the Global Economy 
CAMBRIDGE - Suppose that the world &apos;s leading policymakers were to meet again in Bretton Woods , New Hamp ­ shire , to design a new global economic order . 
They would natu ­ rally be preoccupied with today &apos;s problems : the eurozone crisis , global recovery , financial regulation , international macroeconomic imbal ­ ances , and so on . 
But addressing these issues would require the assembled leaders to rise above them and consider the soundness of global economic arrangements overall . 
Here are seven commonsense principles of global economic governance that they might agree on . 
1 . 
Markets must be deeply embedded in systems of governance . 
The idea that markets are self-regulating received a mortal blow in the recent financial crisis and should be buried once and for all . 
Markets require other social institutions to support them . 
They rely on courts , legal frameworks , and regulators to set and enforce rules . 
They depend on the stabilizing functions that central banks and countercyclical fiscal policy provide . 
They need the political buy-in that redistributive taxation , safety nets , and social insurance help generate . 
And all of this is true of global markets as well . 
2 . 
For the foreseeable future , democratic governance is likely to be organized largely within national political communities . 
The nation state lives , if not entirely well , and remains essen ­ tially the only game in town . 
The quest for global governance is a fool &apos;s errand . 
National governments are unlikely to cede significant control to transnational institutions , and harmonizing rules would not benefit societies with diverse needs and preferences . 
The European Union may be the sole excep ­ tion to this axiom , though its current crisis tends to prove the point . 
Too often we waste international cooperation on overly ambitious goals , ultimately producing weak results that are the lowest common denominator among major states . 
When international cooperation does &quot; succeed , &quot; it spawns rules that are either toothless or reflect the preferences of only the more powerful states . 
The Basle rules on capital requirements and the World Trade Organization &apos;s rules on subsidies , intellectual property , and investment measures typify this kind of overreaching . 
We can enhance the efficiency and legitimacy of globalization by supporting rather than crippling democratic procedures at home . 
3 . 
Pluralist prosperity . 
Acknowledging that the core institutional infrastructure of the global economy must be built at the national level frees countries to develop the institutions that suit them best . 
The United States , Europe , and Japan have produced comparable amounts of wealth over the long term . 
Yet their labor markets , cor ­ porate governance , antitrust rules , social protection , and financial systems differ considerably , with a succession of these &quot; models &quot; - a different one each decade - anointed the great success to be emulated . 
The most successful societies of the future will leave room for experimentation and allow for further evolution of institutions . 
A global economy that recognizes the need for and value of institutional diversity would foster rather than stifle such experimentation and evolution . 
4 . 
Countries have the right to protect their own regulations and institutions . 
The previous principles may seem innocuous . 
But they carry powerful implications that clash with the received wisdom of globalization &apos;s advocates . 
One such impli ­ cation is the right of individual countries to safeguard their domestic institutional choices . 
Recognition of institutional diversity would be meaningless if countries did not have the instru ­ ments available to shape and maintain - in a word , &quot; protect &quot; - their own institutions . 
We should therefore accept that countries may uphold national rules - tax policies , financial regulations , labor standards , or consumer health and safety rules - and may do so by raising barriers at the border if necessary , when trade demonstrably threat ­ ens domestic practices enjoying broad popular support . 
If globalization &apos;s boosters are right , the clamor for protection will fail for lack of evidence or support . 
If wrong , there will be a safety valve in place to ensure that contending values - the benefits of open economies versus the gains from upholding domestic regulations - both receive a proper hearing in public debates . 
5 . 
Countries have no right to impose their institutions on others . 
Using restrictions on cross-border trade or finance to uphold values and regulations at home must be distinguished from using them to impose these values and regulations on other countries . 
Globalization &apos;s rules should not force Americans or Europeans to consume goods that are produced in ways that most citizens in those countries find unacceptable . 
But nor should they allow the US or the EU to use trade sanctions or other pressure to alter foreign countries &quot; labor-market rules , environmen ­ tal policies , or financial regulations . 
Countries have a right to difference , not to imposed convergence . 
6 . 
International economic arrangements must establish rules for managing interaction among national institutions . 
Relying on nation states to provide the essential governance functions of the world economy does not mean that we should aban ­ don international rules . 
The Bretton Woods regime , after all , had clear rules , though they were limited in scope and depth . 
What we need are traffic rules for the global economy that help vehicles of varying size , shape , and speed navigate around each other , rather than imposing an identical car or a uniform speed limit . 
We should strive to attain maximum globalization consistent with the maintenance of space for diversity in national institu ­ tional arrangements . 
7 . 
Non-democratic countries cannot count on the same rights and privileges in the international economic order as democracies . 
What gives the previous principles their appeal and legitimacy is that they are based on democratic deliberation - where it really occurs , within national states . 
When states are not democratic , this scaffolding col ­ lapses . 
We can no longer presume that its institutional arrangements reflect its citizens &quot; preferences . 
So non-democracies need to play by different , less permissive rules . 
These are the principles that the architects of the next global economic order must accept . 
Most importantly , they must comprehend the ultimate paradox that each of these principles highlights : globalization works best when it is not pushed too far .
