Has Public Policy Become Too Public ? 
In 1897 , the House of Representatives in the US state of Indiana unanimously passed legislation that redefined the calculation of the value of pi , the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter . 
Fortunately , the bill died in the state senate . 
That historical anecdote might elicit a sardonic chuckle from those who remember their high-school mathematics , but around the world non-experts are increasingly being called upon to formulate public policy that requires an understanding of subtle and complex scientific and technological phenomena . 
&quot; How can you tell whether a whale is a mammal or a fish ? &quot; a teacher asks her third-grade class . 
&quot; Take a vote ? &quot; chirps one pupil . 
This suggestion may be amusing coming from a child , but there &apos;s nothing funny when governments apply it , as they increasingly do , to complex policies that involve science and technology . 
Britons had their say during the summer , for example , on whether they want gene-spliced , or genetically modified ( GM ) , products in their fields and food . 
To gauge public opinion in advance of a decision scheduled for later this year on whether to allow commercial planting of GM crops , the British government sponsored ( at great expense ) a series of public discussions around the country . 
Local governments and other organizations held hundreds of additional public meetings . 
The head of the British debates &apos; organizing committee , Professor Malcolm Grant , called them a &quot; unique experiment to find out what ordinary people really think once they &apos;ve heard all the arguments . &quot; 
But the reality argues otherwise . 
Mark Henderson , science correspondent for the Times ( London ) , offered this view of the UK &apos;s half-million-pound initiative : &quot; The exercise has been farce from start to finish . 
I &apos;m not sure I want the man in the street to set Britain &apos;s science , technology , and agriculture policy . 
One of the six meetings ... spent much of its time discussing whether the SARS virus might come from GM cotton in China . 
It &apos;s more likely to have come from outer space . &quot; 
Henderson also observed that the meetings were dominated by anti-technology zealots , the only faction sufficiently organized and inspired about the issue to attend . 
The urge to base official policy on public opinion about such issues flourishes across the Atlantic as well . 
The US National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , whose primary mission is to support laboratory research across many disciplines , is funding a series of &quot; citizens &apos; technology forums , &quot; at which average , previously uninformed Americans come together to solve a thorny question of technology policy . 
According to the NSF &apos;s abstract of the project , being carried out by researchers at North Carolina State University , participants &quot; receive information about that issue from a range of content-area experts , experts on social implications of science and technology , and representatives of special interest groups . &quot; 
This is supposed to enable them to reach consensus &quot; and ultimately generate recommendations . &quot; 
The project , first funded in 2002 to support two panels , calls for eight more panels this year , each comprised of 15 citizens who are &quot; representative of the local population . &quot; 
Their deliberations will be overseen by a research team &quot; composed of faculty in rhetoric of science , group decision-making , and political science . &quot; 
The team will test both &quot; an innovative measure of democratic deliberation &quot; and also &quot; political science theory , by investigating relationships between gender , ethnicity , lower socioeconomic status , and increases in efficacy and trust in regulators . &quot; 
This is the scientific equivalent of art for art &apos;s sake , but getting policy recommendations on an obscure and complex technical question from groups of citizen nonexperts ( who are recruited by newspaper ads ) is considerably more dangerous . 
Imagine going from your cardiologist &apos;s office to a caf√© , explaining to the waitress the therapeutic options for your chest pain , and asking her whether you should have the angioplasty or just take medication . 
The first of these NSF-funded groups tackled regulatory policy toward agricultural biotechnology , and recommended that the government tighten regulations for growing GM crops , including a new requirement that the foods from these crops be labeled to identify them for consumers . 
These proposals are unwarranted , inappropriate , and contrary to the recommendations of experts , both within the government and in the scientific community . 
To be sure , involvement of the public is critical to their understanding of government policy . 
Science is not democratic . 
The citizenry do not get to vote on whether a whale is a mammal or a fish , or on the temperature at which water boils . 
Parliaments cannot repeal laws of nature . 
Even if a billion people embrace a foolish idea , it is still a foolish idea . 
The goal of policy formulation should be to get the right answers . 
Formulating public policy towards science and technology may be difficult , but if democracy is to take public opinion appropriately into account , good government must discount ignorance and prejudice . 
The 18th-century Irish statesman and writer Edmund Burke emphasized the government &apos;s responsibility to make such determinations . 
He observed that in republics , &quot; Your representative owes you , not only his industry , but his judgment ; and he betrays , instead of serves you , if he sacrifices it to your opinion . &quot;
