Nigerian Democracy Grows Up 
ABUJA - Nigeria &apos;s legislative elections , to be followed by a presidential poll on April 16 , indicate that the ruling Peoples &quot; Democratic Party ( PDP ) has lost its near-total grip on the country &apos;s politics . 
Of the four main opposition parties that fielded candidates for the 469 parliamentary seats in contention , the Action Congress of Nigeria ( ACN ) took the bulk of the votes in the southwest of the country , felling such PDP stalwarts as House speaker Dimeji Bankole and Senator Iyabo Obasanjo-Bello , daughter of former President Olusegun Obasanjo . 
The PDP did , however , fend off challenge in the oil-producing Niger Delta , President Goodluck Jonathan &apos;s home region . 
It also held its own in the predominantly Igbo southeast and the middle belt , home to several small ethnic groups . 
Bitter controversy marked Jonathan &apos;s ascension to power in May 2010 , following the death of President Umaru Yar &apos;Adua after only three years in office . 
Some PDP politicians in the Muslim north insisted that their region be allowed to present a candidate , as Obasanjo , who was viewed as representing the Christian south , had served eight years . 
They were rebuffed . 
Analysts predicted that a large share of the region &apos;s votes would go to the Congress for Progressive Change ( CPC ) , led by Muhammadu Buhari , a northern Muslim from the state of Katsina . 
Buhari is also the party &apos;s presidential candidate . 
The CPC won the majority of the seats in Katsina , but the PDP still managed to maintain its dominance of that volatile region &apos;s politics . 
The parliamentary polls , originally scheduled for April 2 but postponed a week after the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) failed to print adequate ballot papers and other election materials , took place in an atmosphere of fear , violence , and uncertainty . 
Bombs went off in the INEC office in Suleja , near the federal capital , on the eve of the polling , killing several election officials . 
Explosions in Maiduguri , a large city in the northeast where Boko Haram , a violent Muslim sect , remains a threatening presence despite a 2009 government crackdown , forced many voters to stay home . 
Seventy-four million Nigerians were registered to vote , but turnout was far below that . 
Attahiru Jega , a university teacher and chairman of the INEC from August 2010 , overhauled a sclerotic and corrupt election machinery , put in place a new and credible voting register , and retrained and deployed his staff to 120,000 polling stations in a vast country - all in six months . 
The election was always going to be a challenge , all the more so because , following the end of military rule in 1999 , Nigerian politicians had become habituated to rigging polls . 
After all , the 2007 election that brought Yar &apos;Adua to power - the PDP &apos;s third straight &quot; victory &quot; - was judged by local and international observers to be the worst in the country &apos;s history . 
Indeed , prior to the vote earlier this month , Nigeria had settled into a rut of &quot; electoral authoritarianism . &quot; 
The all-powerful PDP , relying on its control of the security agencies , the considerable oil revenues to which the president and his retinue had untrammeled access , and an intricate patronage network radiating through the local councils of Nigeria &apos;s 36 states , seemed set to govern indefinitely . 
Elections had become a hollow ritual , matters of public policy were not important campaign issues , and the opposition was divided , poorly funded , and unable to devise a strategy to cut the PDP juggernaut to size . 
To President Jonathan &apos;s credit , he delivered clean elections . 
As the INEC proceeded to implement an elaborate device to check potential vote riggers , he stood his ground and backed Jega , even as hawks within his party began to mutter that Jega was a &quot; dangerous radical &quot; whom the president should sack . 
Opposition parties found their feet , and the PDP &apos;s power monopoly was finally broken - but not obliterated . 
In fact , Jonathan and the PDP look set to turn in a good performance in the presidential polls . 
The CPC &apos;s poor showing in the North &apos;s parliamentary polls could be an indication that the region &apos;s influential conservative politicians , whom Buhari took on when , as an army general , he toppled the Second Republic in a bloodless coup in December 1983 , have neither forgiven nor forgotten . 
Talks are ongoing between the CPC , the ACN , which is fielding Nuhu Ribadu , the former anti-corruption czar as presidential candidate , and the All Nigeria Peoples Party , a minor party running Ibrahim Shekarau as its nominee , to field a joint candidate . 
Buhari has more name recognition nationwide than the other two , but Ribadu &apos;s ACN outperformed the CPC during in the parliamentary election . 
So who will step aside for whom remains unclear . 
If , however , the opposition parties resolve their differences and manage to stitch together a firm common platform , they could force Jonathan into a runoff . 
That the elections were held at all - and without violent conflict between the country &apos;s north and south - is a remarkable achievement . 
The country &apos;s mounting problems - rampant official corruption , decaying social and physical infrastructure , and growing ethnic and religious insurgencies in the northeast , central region , the southeast , and Niger Delta - are yet to be seriously tackled . 
Nevertheless , ordinary Nigerians hope that the presidential election this week , and governorship and state-assembly polls on April 26 , will put into office politicians who will , at long last , take on these challenges . 
As the parliamentary elections showed , it is time that Nigerians receive democracy &apos;s dividend : a government that reflects their interests and responds to their demands .
