Measuring the Revolutionary Wave 
NEW YORK - A prediction three months ago that popular protests would soon topple a dictatorship in Tunisia , sweep Hosni Mubarak from power in Egypt , provoke civil war in Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s Libya , and rattle regimes from Morocco to Yemen would have drawn serious skepticism . 
We knew that the tinder was dry , but we could never know how or when , exactly , it would combust . 
Now that it has , how far can the flames spread ? 
Some commentators have taken to calling this moment the &quot; Arab Spring , &quot; an awakening that might permanently cripple autocracy in the Middle East . 
The contagion effect seems clear . 
Countries across the region have large numbers of young people and too few jobs . 
Food prices are rising . 
Corruption fuels anger . 
In Egypt , young people , inspired by satellite television images and empowered by modern communications , lit and fed the fire . 
Given the easy availability of these technologies , their ability to catalyze protest might transcend borders once thought impregnable . 
But , with their survival at stake , authoritarian regimes are good at spotting threats in the neighborhood and adapting to meet them . 
Though satellite television , mobile phones , and online social networking can force some authoritarians to become more responsive to popular demands , governments can also use these technologies to identify and isolate threats , monitor communications among activists , and transmit messages of their own . 
More to the point , the protests now roiling the Arab world have little to do with the &quot; Prague Spring &quot; of 1968 or the revolutions that swept through Eastern Europe in 1989 . 
Unlike Cold War-era East Germans , Czechs , and Poles , protesters in today &apos;s Middle East are not unified by opposition to foreign control . 
To be sure , many Arab young people blame America for bolstering the local dictator , but their resentment doesn &apos;t begin to compare with anti-Soviet attitudes in the Warsaw Pact . 
Arab youth have no Soviet Union to cast off - and no Europe to join . 
Instead , today &apos;s Middle East is most usefully compared to the increasingly restive former Soviet republics of a few years ago . 
In 2003 , a &quot; Rose Revolution &quot; in Georgia elevated a younger generation led by a president without ties to Soviet communism . 
Mikhail Saakashvili remains in power , though a brutal four-day war with Russia in 2008 sharply limited Georgia &apos;s ability to influence events beyond its borders . 
In Ukraine , the &quot; Orange Revolution &quot; in 2004 overturned the results of a rigged election , sidelining Viktor Yanukovych in favor of Viktor Yushchenko . 
In Kyrgyzstan in 2005 , the &quot; Tulip Revolution &quot; forced the ouster of Askar Akayev . 
Hastily held elections lifted Kurmanbek Bakiyev to the presidency . 
Yet , in 2010 , a new round of protests forced Bakiyev from power . 
As in the Middle East , each of these upheavals reflected the willingness of many people to risk their lives and livelihoods to topple a corrupt government that could or would not generate opportunity and prosperity for them . 
All three arrived like bolts from the blue . 
So far , their main lasting effect has been to frighten neighboring autocrats into action . 
Governments in Armenia , Azerbaijan , Belarus , and Uzbekistan have infiltrated and undermined civil-society organizations , kicked out Western observers and aid workers , and leaned on local courts to guarantee favorable election-related rulings . 
Uzbekistan , in particular , has proven its willingness to brutalize protesters . 
The wealthiest of the post-Soviet states , Russia and Kazakhstan , took similar preemptive steps against instability that never came . 
As in Georgia and Ukraine , Tunisia and Egypt will have new governments to grapple with old problems . 
Other Arab regimes are now spending their way back to stability with money that most former Soviet states didn &apos;t have . 
Some have enough cash for new subsidies and direct handouts , as well as to pay their military and security forces more and reinforce their tools and methods of crowd control . 
Threats to the wealthier Persian Gulf states , in particular , are exaggerated . 
Bahrain , the world &apos;s only Shia-majority country governed by a Sunni monarch , remains on edge . 
In the end , Bahrain &apos;s Shia majority will likely gain more rights and political representation , as well as cash payments and jobs , but Khalifa will remain in charge . 
There is even less risk in Saudi Arabia itself , where King Abdullah recently promised more than $ 130 billion in stimulus spending . 
The few Saudi demonstrations appear populated almost entirely by minority Shia , who find little sympathy among majority Sunnis , and by foreign construction workers petitioning for higher wages and better working conditions . 
Syria &apos;s President Bashar al-Assad has more domestic support than recent media accounts of unrest in the country &apos;s south suggest . 
Nor does Iran &apos;s government appear to face real danger . 
The brutal crackdown on post-election protests in 2009 demonstrated the regime &apos;s determination to maintain order by any means necessary . 
For the moment , most of Iran &apos;s opposition will continue to try to change the country from within the limits of the current system . 
In the Middle East , only in Yemen is unrest likely to bring about another regime change . 
Outside of Libya , where violent stalemate could continue for some time , embattled North African regimes also will muddle through . 
Protests in Morocco have not cut into King Mohammad &apos;s broad popular support , and promises of economic and political reform will probably satisfy opposition parties for the time being . 
In Algeria , demonstrations have lost momentum , and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika can rely on his military to keep diehard activists in check . 
The Arab Spring has upended assumptions about popular patience in the region . 
A new chapter has begun .
