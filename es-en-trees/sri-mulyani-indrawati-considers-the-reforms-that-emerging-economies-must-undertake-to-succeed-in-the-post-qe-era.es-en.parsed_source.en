The Global Economy Without Steroids 
WASHINGTON , DC - Economic growth is back . 
Not only are the United States , Europe , and Japan finally expanding at the same time , but developing countries are also regaining strength . 
As a result , world GDP will rise by 3.2 % this year , up from 2.4 % in 2013 - meaning that 2014 may well be the year when the global economy turns the corner . 
The fact that the advanced economies are bouncing back is good news for everyone . 
The simple answer is no . 
Just as an athlete might use steroids to get quick results , while avoiding the tough workouts that are needed to develop endurance and ensure long-term health , some emerging economies have relied on short-term capital inflows ( so-called &quot; hot money &quot; ) to support growth , while delaying or even avoiding difficult but necessary economic and financial reforms . 
With the US Federal Reserve set to tighten the exceptionally generous monetary conditions that have driven this &quot; easy growth , &quot; such emerging economies will have to change their approach , despite much tighter room for maneuver , or risk losing the ground that they have gained in recent years . 
As the Fed &apos;s monetary-policy tightening becomes a reality , the World Bank predicts that capital flows to developing countries will fall from 4.6 % of their GDP in 2013 to around 4 % in 2016 . 
But , if long-term US interest rates rise too fast , or policy shifts are not communicated well enough , or markets become volatile , capital flows could quickly plummet - possibly by more than 50 % for a few months . 
This scenario has the potential to disrupt growth in those emerging economies that have failed to take advantage of the recent capital inflows by pursuing reforms . 
The likely rise in interest rates will put considerable pressure on countries with large current-account deficits and high levels of foreign debt - a result of five years of credit expansion . 
Indeed , last summer , when speculation that the Fed would soon begin to taper its purchases of long-term assets ( so-called quantitative easing ) , financial-market pressures were strongest in markets suspected of having weak fundamentals . 
Turkey , Brazil , Indonesia , India , and South Africa - dubbed the &quot; Fragile Five &quot; - were hit particularly hard . 
Similarly , some emerging-market currencies have come under renewed pressure in recent days , triggered in part by the devaluation of the Argentine peso and signs of a slowdown in Chinese growth , as well as doubts about these economies &quot; real strengths amid generally skittish market sentiment . 
Like the turbulence last summer , the current bout of market pressure is mainly affecting economies characterized by either domestic political tensions or economic imbalances . 
But , for most developing countries , the story has not been so bleak . 
Financial markets in many developing countries have not come under significant pressure - either in the summer or now . 
Indeed , more than three-fifths of developing countries - many of which are strong economic performers that benefited from pre-crisis reforms ( and thus attracted more stable capital inflows like foreign-direct investment ) - actually appreciated last spring and summer . 
Furthermore , returning to the athletic metaphor , some have continued to exercise their muscles and improve their stamina - even under pressure . 
Mexico , for example , opened its energy sector to foreign partnerships last year - a politically difficult reform that is likely to bring significant long-term benefits . 
Indeed , it arguably helped Mexico avoid joining the Fragile Five . 
Stronger growth in high-income economies will also create opportunities for developing countries - for example , through increased import demand and new sources of investment . 
While these opportunities will be more difficult to capture than the easy capital inflows of the quantitative-easing era , the payoffs will be far more durable . 
But , in order to take advantage of them , countries , like athletes , must put in the work needed to compete successfully - through sound domestic policies that foster a business-friendly pro-competition environment , an attractive foreign-trade regime , and a healthy financial sector . 
Part of the challenge in many countries will be to rebuild macroeconomic buffers that have been depleted during years of fiscal and monetary stimulus . 
Reducing fiscal deficits and bringing monetary policy to a more neutral plane will be particularly difficult in countries like the Fragile Five , where growth has been lagging . 
As is true of an exhausted athlete who needs to rebuild strength , it is never easy for a political leader to take tough reform steps under pressure . 
But , for emerging economies , doing so is critical to restoring growth and enhancing citizens &quot; wellbeing . 
Surviving the crisis is one thing ; emerging as a winner is something else entirely .
