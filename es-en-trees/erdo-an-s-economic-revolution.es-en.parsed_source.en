Erdoğan &apos;s Economic Revolution 
ISTANBUL - Since 2002 , the Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) has been governing Turkey with remarkable success in economic terms . 
Indeed , its record is almost unique in Turkey &apos;s modern history , comparable only with the rule of the Democratic Party ( DP ) , which came to power in the 1950 &quot; s , at the start of multi-party parliamentary democracy in Turkey , and ran the country for a decade . 
The era of DP rule is ingrained in Turkey &apos;s public consciousness as one of phenomenal growth and expanding freedoms . 
With the mandate it received in the June 12 election , and almost 42 years after the DP was deposed by a military junta , the AKP has emerged to set new benchmarks in Turkey &apos;s development . 
Indeed , unlike the DP &apos;s leader , Adnan Menderes , who was brutally executed following a sham military trial , the AKP &apos;s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , who will now begin his third term as Prime Minister , appears to have secured democratic political control of Turkey &apos;s military and bureaucracy . 
Both institutions &quot; ability to challenge the results of elections appears at an end . 
Turkey &apos;s latest transformation began with the severe economic , political , and social turmoil of 2001 , which then-Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit called a &quot; crisis of the Turkish state . &quot; 
That year marked the last gasp of the authoritarian / bureaucratic regime that emerged in the early 1920 &quot; s , and that had become so isolated from the public that its legitimacy had evaporated . 
Over the years , that system had been captured by self-interested rent-seekers . 
Tension , and at times open confrontation , between a modernizing elite and ordinary people regarding the nature , function , and design of the state undermined the very capacity to govern . 
A political pendulum of reform and reaction , and of populist and pragmatic cabinets , weakened the republic for most of its history . 
Unlike Japan , for example , with its de facto one-party government for most of the period since 1945 , the lifespan of Turkish governments averaged around 14 months between 1960 and 2000 . 
Whereas political stasis supported a development miracle in Japan , the inertia created by Turkey &apos;s self-interested establishment resulted in a discouraged society with unfulfilled expectations . 
With much of its immediate neighborhood convulsed in revolutionary change and in search of a viable road forward , understanding how Turkey moved from cronyism to economic dynamism is vitally important . 
First , Erdoğan &apos;s government recognized that change can deliver greater stability than inertia , which invariably breaks down chaotically as economic decline and political infighting take hold . 
Second , Turkey shows that an external anchor , such as membership in the European Union or pressure from the International Monetary Fund , can be decisive in triggering change and , therefore , in enhancing prosperity . 
But the best way to understand what Erdoğan &apos;s government has gotten right is to examine what went wrong in the &quot; lost decade &quot; of the 1990 &quot; s . 
That decade was characterized by low and unstable growth ; low per capita GDP , at around $ 3,400 dollars ; dramatically low productivity ; an unsustainable fiscal and financial position in both the public and private sectors ; average annual inflation of 70 % for more than two decades ; a lack of competitiveness , reflected in 10 % unemployment ; and widespread corruption . 
Partly as a result of these factors , Europeans tended to refer to Turkey as &quot; too big , too poor , and too unstable &quot; for full EU membership . 
Weary with crisis , Ecevit &apos;s administration embarked on a comprehensive reform package- spearheaded by Minister for the Economy Kemal Dervis - that included a flexible exchange-rate system with a dedicated inflation-targeting regime . 
With this macroeconomic groundwork laid , greater economic , and soon political , stability followed . 
In 2003 came the formation of the AKP &apos;s first single-party government , which enthusiastically backed the country &apos;s IMF-based stabilization program . 
Turkey &apos;s adoption of a road map for full membership in the EU also created a strong impulse to follow through on painful reforms . 
Exceptionally favorable economic conditions worldwide at this time no doubt helped significantly , but the real credit must go to a government that stuck to its liberalizing instincts . 
This consistency has paid off . 
From 2002-2007 , Turkey experienced its longest period of uninterrupted economic growth , which averaged 6-7 % year on year , while annual inflation has plummeted ( it now stands at 3.9 % ) . 
Moreover , the economy proved resilient following the global financial crisis , with growth recovering rapidly . 
Indeed , annual real GDP rose by 9 % in 2010 . 
And , despite Turkey &apos;s fast-growing population , per capita GDP has tripled since 2002 , reaching $ 10,500 in 2010 . 
As a result , Turkey is projected to graduate from &quot; middle-income &quot; status and enter to the league of rich countries by 2012 . 
Not surprisingly , Turkey &apos;s capacity to attract foreign direct investment is now comparable to other fast-growing emerging-market economies . 
But serious problems remain . 
The ever-rising current-account deficit ( 6.8 % of GDP in 2010 ) will require a second round of reforms . 
And unemployment remains stubbornly high , though employment is now more widespread than it has ever been . 
For the first time in its modern history , Turkey not only resisted a serious global economic crisis , but also decoupled itself from the rest of Europe by rebounding strongly in 2010 . 
This economic prowess , together with the government &apos;s &quot; zero problem &quot; foreign policy , have helped make Turkey a leading regional power . 
Turkey &apos;s achievements form a case study in successful economic development . 
The question now is how Turkey will use its rapidly growing economic power .
