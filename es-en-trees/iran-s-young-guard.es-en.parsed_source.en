Iran &apos;s Young Guard 
TEHRAN - Iranians will go to the polls on June 12 to elect a new president . 
While some argue that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s re-election is a foregone conclusion , the outcome is , in fact , not at all clear . 
Iran &apos;s Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has repeatedly said in public settings that he will not declare his preference among the candidates . 
Indeed , in Mashad on March 21 , Ayatollah Khamenei said , &quot; There were some rumors that I support a special candidate for the presidential elections . 
So how will the Iranian people weigh their votes ? 
To answer , one needs to understand the composition of the Iranian electorate . 
With the voting age set at just 16 years , Iran has roughly 48 million eligible voters . 
Turnout averages 60-65 % in presidential elections , implying that around 29 million votes are likely to be cast . 
Analysts point to several electoral cleavages , particularly the urban-rural split and socioeconomic status . 
Moreover , a key determinant of voting behavior in the upcoming elections is likely to be generational . 
Some 46 % of the electorate is under the age of 30 . In previous elections , younger voters have turned out in greater numbers than their elders , leading some to predict that half of the voters will be in the 16-to-29 age bracket . 
The number of potential first-time voters ( 16 to 19 years old ) is estimated at six million . 
Several factors distinguish members of this group from the rest of the Iranian electorate . 
They are more educated , more urbanized , and more internationally oriented than previous generations . 
More of them are university educated , and , of this group , a majority is female . 
They have branched out into new lines of work and social engagement , as inventors , entrepreneurs , and bloggers . 
No candidate can be elected president of Iran without significant support among younger voters . 
Age , not social class , will determine the outcome of June &apos;s election . 
Like all Iranians , younger voters are focused on economic issues , particularly the difficult combination of high inflation and high unemployment . 
The populist policies of the past four years have not brought economic improvement . 
Younger Iranians have a particular economic concern as well . 
With so many of them graduating from universities , they suffer from a mismatch between their qualifications and the jobs on offer . 
Underemployment is deeply frustrating to them . 
They also want a more liberal social environment that would loosen restrictions on their dress , broaden access to cultural products like film and music , and enlarge press freedoms . 
They want university campuses , in particular , to be more open . 
Finally , younger Iranians are tired of Iran &apos;s international isolation . 
They want Iran to succeed - and to be recognized for its success - in sports , arts , and education at an international level . 
As of this writing , only two presidential candidates have declared themselves : former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Moussavi and former parliament speaker Mehdi Karroubi . 
Assuming that Ahmadinejad seeks re-election , this line-up lacks any candidate with clear appeal to the youth vote . 
Given their dissatisfaction , it would be natural for young voters to take out their frustrations on Ahmadinejad . 
One seemingly unrelated event to watch : in the week before the presidential vote , Iran will play two critical football matches as part of the qualifying round for the 2010 World Cup . 
If Iran fails to qualify , this could turn some young voters against the incumbent . 
Among the other candidates , who will pick up this slack ? 
Moussavi , Iran &apos;s prime minister between 1981 and 1989 , is barely known to young voters . 
However , his campaign has been hinting that , if elected , Moussavi will loosen some social and cultural restrictions . 
Karroubi , too , is handicapped among the young . 
Many consider him to be an old , out-of-touch cleric with no feel for their concerns . 
Former President Mohammad Khatami , who openly considered trying again for the office , would have been a strong candidate for young voters . 
His decision not to run disappointed many of them . 
Standing in the wings is one possible candidate who might take up where Khatami left off and address the economic and cultural concerns of young Iranians . 
Though he has not announced his candidacy , Mohammad Baquer Qalibaf , now Mayor of Tehran and formerly the country &apos;s chief of police , has a relatively moderate track record and an image of someone who can get things done . 
But Qalibaf still has not taken the plunge . 
If he doesn &apos;t , and if no younger candidate emerges , the youth bloc in Iran &apos;s electorate may have nowhere to turn . 
Without a voice for their concerns , Iran &apos;s young people face the prospect of increased frustration , whatever the outcome of the election .
