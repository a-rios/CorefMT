The Fiscal Cliff and US Foreign Policy 
PRINCETON - The world should be worried . 
The possibility that US President Barack Obama and the Republicans in Congress will fail to reach a compromise before mandatory deep spending cuts and tax increases take effect on January 1 is very real . 
Global markets are well aware of the danger of the United States falling over the &quot; fiscal cliff , &quot; and are watching nervously . 
Foreign ministries around the world should be equally nervous . 
In the short term , Syria and its neighbors are already paying the price of America &apos;s inability to focus on anything other than domestic politics since Obama &apos;s re-election . 
In my view , the Syrian crisis is at a tipping point : while it is now apparent that the opposition will eventually win and President Bashar al-Assad will fall , the endgame &apos;s duration will be a key element determining who actually comes into power and on what terms . 
Syria &apos;s implosion , and the chaos and extremism that are likely to breed there , will threaten the entire Middle East : the stability of Lebanon , Jordan , Turkey , Iraq , Gaza , the West Bank , Israel , Iran , and Saudi Arabia hangs in the balance . 
But we do not even know who will succeed Hillary Clinton as US Secretary of State when Obama &apos;s second term formally begins in January , or who will be on the White House security team . 
In the medium term , the world abounds with tensions and potential crises that US leadership is likely to be indispensable to resolving . 
As events over the past two weeks in Egypt have demonstrated all too vividly , the Arab awakening is still only in its first act in many countries . 
Indeed , democracy is fragile , at best , across North Africa ; and , in the Middle East , Jordan , the Palestinian territories , Kuwait , and Saudi Arabia have only begun to feel the ripples of the tidal wave sweeping the region . 
Bahrain remains a flashpoint ; 
Even when the US is not on the front lines , it has played a vital role in behind-the-scenes diplomacy , nudging wary rivals closer to one another to create a united opposition , and working with regional leaders like Turkey , Egypt , and Saudi Arabia to broker deals . 
In Asia , the US has been playing a similar role in pushing for multilateral resolution of dangerous bilateral disputes between China and its many neighbors over territories in the East and South China Seas , while at the same time restraining US allies who might otherwise provoke crises . 
And , on big global issues like climate change , organized crime , trade , and prevention of atrocities , the absence of the US as a policy catalyst and active negotiator will be quickly and keenly felt . 
Avoiding this fate requires the US to &quot; rebuild itself at home , &quot; as the Obama administration &apos;s 2010 National Security Strategy promises . 
But , if US politicians spend the next two years the way they have spent the last two - patching together temporary policy fixes while avoiding the hard issues that voters and markets expect them to face - America &apos;s voice will grow fainter , and weaker , in international institutions and affairs . 
Equally worrisome is the prospect of deep , across-the-board cuts in the US defense budget at a time when many rising powers are increasing their defense spending . 
As much as many countries may dislike the US military , the availability and extraordinary capabilities of America &apos;s soldiers , ships , aircraft , and intelligence assets often function as a global insurance policy . 
In the long term , the challenge is more vague , but deeper . 
The longer the US obsesses over its own political dysfunction and attendant economic stagnation , the less likely it is to bear the mantle of global responsibility and leadership . 
Openly isolationist political forces , such as the Tea Party and libertarians like Ron Paul , will grow stronger . 
A retreating US will , in turn , guarantee the emergence of what foreign-policy analyst Ian Bremmer describes as a &quot; G-Zero world , &quot; in which no country will take the lead and marshal the necessary economic and political coalitions to solve collective problems . 
Individual presidents and secretaries of state will certainly try . 
But , without Congressional support , they will bring fewer and fewer resources to the table and will suffer from an increasing credibility gap when they seek to negotiate with other countries . 
Global leaders can do more than stand by and watch . 
Why not remind US politicians of their global responsibilities ? 
The G-7 or G-8 leaders could issue a statement , for instance , urging the US to get its fiscal house in order . 
NATO allies could make a similar statement . 
Indeed , other regional organizations , such as the African Union or the Arab League , could weigh in . 
Even G-20 members , were they so moved , could make a statement . 
Of course , when we think about the G-20 , we immediately wonder who , other than the US , could organize the issuance of such a statement . 
That is precisely the problem , and it could get much worse .
