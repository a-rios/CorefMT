Syria &apos;s Final Countdown 
TEL AVIV - A series of crucial defeats of the Syrian army has laid to rest any illusions that the government in Damascus is in control of its country . 
By spreading his forces thinly across Syria , President Bashar al-Assad has drastically reduced his capacity to win decisive battles , and he is now being forced to evacuate wide areas of the country to concentrate his army around Damascus and the Alawite enclave in the northwest . 
As it becomes clear that Assad is likely to lose the war , his closest allies - as well as world powers and regional players - are beginning to plan for the end game . 
In late May , the leader of Hezbollah , Hassan Nasrallah , gave a speech that spoke volumes about the impact of the Syrian war on his organization . 
&quot; The threat we face is existential , &quot; Nasrallah said . 
&quot; We now have three options : to expand the war and fight far more than we have fought in the last four years , to capitulate and be slaughtered , or to disperse throughout the world , walking humiliated and purposeless from catastrophe to catastrophe . &quot; 
More than 3,000 Hezbollah fighters have died in Syria , and another 4,000 have been injured . 
Syrian militants , including Islamic State fighters , have penetrated Lebanon , threatening to rekindle the country &apos;s ethnic war and undermining Hezbollah &apos;s legitimacy as the guarantor of its security . 
Assad &apos;s fall would deny the organization its vital logistic hinterland in Syria , making it vulnerable to challenges by insurgent Sunni militias . 
Iran , too , is likely to face a reckoning , as its ally in Damascus approaches defeat . 
The country &apos;s strategic calculations are bound to have been affected by the ascension of Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to the Saudi throne , a real game changer that has resulted in a shift of alliances among the region &apos;s Sunni powers . 
Stronger ties among Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and Qatar - and the spectacular successes of the latter &apos;s Sunni proxies in Syria - will put pressure on Iran to cut Assad loose or risk being drawn even deeper into the Syrian quagmire . 
The regional proxy war between the Iran-backed Assad government and Sunni-backed rebels has largely undermined America &apos;s influence on the course of events in Syria . 
Sunni fighters have ignored calls by the United States to focus on fighting the Islamic State instead of the Assad regime . 
In fact , the most effective fighting force in the country is Jaish al-Fatah - The Army of Conquest - a collection of Sunni rebel groups , some of which the US considers to be terrorist organizations . 
The US is rightly worried that a victory by Jaish al-Fatah and others might empower anti-Western elements in Syria . 
Drawing from its sad experience in Iraq , the US government fears that Assad &apos;s fall would be quickly followed by the collapse of the Syrian army , leaving the country without a stabilizing force . 
Rather than turning their attention to the Islamic State , the fractious victors would most likely turn on one another . 
As in Libya , the fighting would make the country ungovernable . 
Meanwhile , Russia , which considers the naval base of Tartus to be strategically vital , can be counted on to do all it can to prevent a total defeat of the regime . 
When Secretary of State John Kerry proposed , at a meeting last May , a joint international approach to contain the conflict , Russian President Vladimir Putin was not interested . 
But the Russian regime is not blind to the realities of the battlefield . 
Following the loss of the city of Palmyra to the Islamic State , families of Russian advisers began to be repatriated . 
In preparation for a possible future without Assad , the Kremlin is now trying to gain influence in opposition groups . 
For now , Assad is doing his best to cling to power . 
A power-sharing agreement is all but unthinkable , and Syria &apos;s geography is not well suited to an orderly division along sectarian lines . 
Assad &apos;s war aims have been reduced to avoiding decisive defeat and gaining international legitimacy , in the hope of a favorable political solution . 
The rise of the Islamic State did lend support to the government &apos;s claims that Syria risks being taken over by terrorist groups ; nonetheless , the regime is finding itself increasingly isolated . 
Assad &apos;s final days are unlikely to be pretty . 
The tight-knit members of his clan , his political allies , and many members of the Alawite minority will be fighting for their survival . 
Unless a political solution is somehow found , Syria &apos;s fate will come down to the prophetic words a Sunni frontline fighter from Homs told a German reporter in 2012 . 
&quot; It &apos;s a question of numbers , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There are 18 million Sunnis against him . 
Assad must kill them all . 
Otherwise , we &apos;ll win and kill him and his henchmen . &quot;
