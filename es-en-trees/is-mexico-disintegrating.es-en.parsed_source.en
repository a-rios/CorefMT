Is Mexico Disintegrating ? 
MEXICO CITY - Shortly before America &apos;s elections last November , then vice-presidential candidate Joseph Biden was widely criticized for predicting that an Obama administration would almost certainly be tested by what he called a &quot; generated &quot; international crisis , in much the way that the Soviet Union &quot; tested &quot; John F. Kennedy shortly after he assumed office . 
Biden did not point to a specific region of the world , but mentioned the Middle East , the Indian sub-continent , and Russia as the likeliest sources of trouble for the new president . 
Impolitic or not , Biden &apos;s anxieties seem to have informed several of the administration &apos;s early foreign policy decisions . 
But , as pressing as the Middle East , south Asia , and Russia ( as well as Iran and North Korea ) are , another crisis far closer to home could create as much peril as a nuclear-armed Iran , an aggressively resurgent Russia , or even an Islamist-dominated Pakistan . 
That crisis is located in Mexico , which is in freefall , its state institutions under threat as they have not been since at least the Cristero Uprising of the late 1920 &quot; s and possibly since the Mexican Revolution of 1910 . 
While the Obama administration is obviously aware of what is happening south of the Rio Grande , the threat simply does not command the attention that its gravity requires . 
The crisis consists in nothing less than an effort by the major drug cartels to tame and suborn the Mexican state , and not just in the strip along the United States border , though the epicenter of the crisis is there . 
But , through a policy of terror extending from Oaxaca in the south , through Acapulco on the Pacific coast , and up to the great border cities of Tijuana and Juarez ( Mexico &apos;s sixth and seventh most populous cities , respectively ) , they have made it abundantly clear that they are trying to achieve impunity . 
The only recent parallel in Latin America was a similar effort fifteen years ago by the Colombian drug cartels . 
That disguised coup failed - barely - and there is no guarantee that the result will be similar this time around in Mexico . 
Journalists with long experience of war zones report being more worried about their safety in Mexico border than when they were in Bosnia , Afghanistan , or Iraq , though much of the violence is internecine . 
Of the thousands who have been killed , often after being horribly tortured , many , if not most , have been members of the drug cartels and their families . 
But it is the campaign of targeted assassination against any Mexican official who seems to pose a serious threat to the cartels &quot; operations that makes the crisis so dire . 
First , in May 2007 , the cartels killed Jose Nemesio Lugo Felix , the general coordinator of information at the National Center for Planning and Analysis to Combat Organized Crime . 
Soon after , a hit man murdered Edgar Milan Gomez , Mexico &apos;s highest-ranking Federal police official . 
In November , 2008 , a plane carrying Juan Camilo Mourino , Mexico &apos;s national security advisor , crashed under mysterious circumstances . 
And very recently , retired General Mauro Enrique Tello Quinones , one of the most decorated officers in the Mexican army , was abducted , tortured , and killed less than a week after assuming a new position as anti-drug chief in the resort city of Cancun . 
For all the lip service paid to relations with Mexico ( and , indeed , with Latin America more generally ) from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Obama , the truth is that developments in Mexico have always gotten short shrift from US presidents . 
Illegal immigration is a major issue , to be sure , as is the drug trade . 
It is emblematic that while Obama has received Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n , the White House only recently announced that one of his first foreign trips would be to Mexico . 
And incoming Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked almost nothing about Mexico at her confirmation hearing , and she emphasized relations with Mexico neither in her own statement nor in those she has made since assuming her post . 
Indeed , the conventional wisdom in the US is that Mexico policy regarding illegal immigration and drugs will be the province of the new Homeland Security secretary , Janet Napolitano ( herself a former border state governor ) . 
Meanwhile , the Treasury and Commerce departments will be handle trade policy concerning the North American Free Trade Agreement . 
This is the way Mexico policy has been run for decades . 
And , offensive as this has been to Mexican sensibilities - and harmful to finding long-term solutions to America &apos;s immigration dilemma -these complacent arrangements have never presented so clear and present danger as they do today .
