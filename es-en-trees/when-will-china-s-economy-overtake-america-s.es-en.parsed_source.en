When Will China &apos;s Economy Overtake America &apos;s ? 
BEIJING - Is China poised to surpass the United States to become the world &apos;s largest economy ? 
The International Monetary Fund recently predicted that the size of China &apos;s economy would overtake that of the US in terms of purchasing power parity ( PPP ) by 2016 . 
But a recent co-authored study by Robert Feenstra , an economist at the University of California , Davis , shows that global economic leadership would pass to China in 2014 . 
And , even more radically , Arvind Subramanian of the Peterson Institute of International Economics argues that China actually surpassed the US in PPP terms in 2010 . 
Purchasing power parity measures a country &apos;s income using a set of international prices applied to all economies . 
Prices in developing countries are usually lower than in the developed countries . 
Therefore , their income could be underestimated if calculated only according to the exchange rate . 
Income measured in PPP helps to avoid this problem . 
But estimating PPP income raises its own set of problems . 
One consists in the fact that every country has a different consumption basket , with the greatest disparity between developing and developed countries . 
For example , foods usually account for 40 % or more of household expenditure in a typical developing country , whereas the figure is less than 20 % in most developed countries . 
The purpose of PPP comparison is to measure a country &apos;s real quality of life . 
In this case , it can be thought of as comparing each country &apos;s aggregate good , composed of the goods in each country &apos;s consumption basket . 
But this aggregate good does not have the same components across countries . 
That is , PPP calculations effectively compare apples with oranges . 
This argument may sound technical , but it has profound implications for cross-country comparisons of life quality . 
Suppose we compare two countries . 
One of them is agriculture-based , and people consume only food , while the other is industry-based , and people not only consume food but also buy clothes . 
The share of their expenditure on these two items is 20 % and 80 % , respectively . 
Suppose , further , that per capita nominal income at the market exchange rate in the second country is four times higher than in the first . 
Food prices are the same in the two countries , while in the second country , the price of cloth is five times higher than the price of food . 
In this example , the price of the aggregate good in the second country is 4.2 times the price of the aggregate good in the first country . 
Further calculation reveals that , in PPP terms , a person in the second country is 5 % poorer than a person in the first country ! 
This absurd result is possible only because PPP is comparing two different consumption bundles . 
But the consumption basket of an average Chinese is vastly different from the consumption basket of an average American , so PPP comparisons between China and the US can be misleading . 
PPP gives an answer to the following question : how much does a Chinese need to earn to maintain his quality of life in China when he moves to the US ? 
But this question is neither intuitive nor realistic . 
When it comes to the comparison of purchasing power in the international market , a more sensible question is : how many goods can a Chinese buy in the US using the income he earns in China ? 
One must rely on nominal income to provide an answer to this question . 
In this case , a 10 % appreciation of the renminbi increases the purchasing power of a Chinese person in the US by exactly 10 % , whereas his life quality does not change in PPP terms . 
But China would surpass the US in a relatively short period of time even if we measured both countries &quot; economies in nominal terms . 
Assuming that the Chinese and US economies grow , respectively , by 8 % and 3 % in real terms , that China &apos;s inflation rate is 3.6 % and America &apos;s is 2 % ( the averages of the last decade ) , and that the renminbi appreciates against the dollar by 3 % per year ( the average of the last six years ) , China would become the world &apos;s largest economy by 2021 . 
By that time , both countries &quot; GDP will be about $ 24 trillion , perhaps triple the size of the third largest economy , either Japan or Germany . 
Assuming 8 % growth for China may or may not be a sure bet . 
But if China grew by 9-10 % in the first five years and by 6-7 % in the next five years , the target for an average of 8 % between now and 2021 would be met . 
The world has already begun to demand that China assume greater responsibility for the global economy &apos;s health . 
As China &apos;s economy continues to grow and eventually matches US GDP , this demand will become stronger . 
By almost all recent estimates , China has little time to prepare .
