Gone with the Wind 
COPENHAGEN - Efforts to stem global warming have nurtured a strong urge worldwide to deploy renewable energy . 
As a result , the use of wind turbines has increased ten-fold over the past decade , with wind power often touted as the most cost-effective green opportunity . 
According to Connie Hedegaard , the European Union &apos;s commissioner for climate action , &quot; People should believe that &#91; wind power &#93; is very , very cheap . &quot; 
In fact , this is a highly problematic claim . 
While wind energy is cheaper than other , more ineffective renewables , such as solar , tidal , and ethanol , it is nowhere near competitive . 
If it were , we wouldn &apos;t have to keep spending significant sums to subsidize it . 
In the United Kingdom , for example , wind remains significantly more costly than other energy sources . 
Using the UK Electricity Generation Costs 2010 update and measuring in cost per produced kilowatt-hour , wind is still 20-200 % more expensive than the cheapest fossil-fuel options . 
As the UK and other developed countries have rushed to build more wind turbines , they have naturally started with the windiest places , leaving poorer sites for later . 
At the same time , people increasingly protest against the wind farms in their backyards . 
Local opposition has tripled over the past three years , and local approval rates for new wind farms have sunk to an all-time low . 
Most people believe that a few wind turbines can be attractive , but it is an entirely different matter when turbines are scattered across the countryside , or when massive , industrial wind farms extend for miles . 
Complaints have also increased about enormous new wind turbines &quot; low-frequency noise . 
Given souring public sentiment , most of the future increase in wind turbines is expected to take place offshore , where there is less opposition , but where costs are much higher . 
With its &quot; 20-20-20 &quot; policy , the EU has promised that , by 2020 , it will cut its carbon emissions by 20 % below 1990 levels , and increase its reliance on renewables by 20 % . 
For the UK , this requires a dramatic increase in wind power , especially offshore . 
This will be surprisingly costly . 
The UK Carbon Trust estimates that the cost of expanding wind turbines to 40 gigawatts , in order to provide 31 % of electricity by 2020 , could run as high as £ 75 billion ( $ 120 billion ) . 
In terms of averted rise in temperature , this would be completely insignificant . 
Using a standard climate model , by 2100 , the UK &apos;s huge outlay will have postponed global warming by just over ten days . 
Moreover , this estimate is undoubtedly too optimistic . 
Wind frequently does not blow when we need it . 
For example , as the BBC reported , the cold weather on December 21 , 2010 , was typical of a prolonged cold front , with high-pressure areas and little wind . 
Whereas wind power , on average , supplies 5 % of the UK &apos;s electricity , its share fell to just 0.04 % that day . 
With demand understandably peaking , other sources , such as coal and gas , had to fill the gap . 
Making up for a 5 % shortfall in supply is manageable , but the situation will change dramatically as the UK increases its reliance on wind power to reach the 31 % target by 2020 . 
Wind power becomes much more expensive when we factor in the large supplies of power that must be created for backup whenever the wind dies down . 
The cheapest backup power by far is provided by open-cycle gas plants , which imply more CO2 emissions . 
Thus , wind power will ultimately be both costlier and reduce emissions less than officially estimated . 
( This is also why simple calculations based on costs per kWh are often grossly misleading , helping to make wind and other intermittent renewables appear to be cheaper than they are . ) 
This has been shown in recent reports by KPMG / Mercados and Civitas , an independent think tank . 
A new report by University of Edinburgh professor Gordon Hughes for the Global Warming Policy Foundation estimates that 36 GW of new wind power would cost £ 120 billion for just 23 megatons of CO2 reduction per year . 
In other words , temperature rises would be postponed by a mere 66 hours by the end of the century . 
Contrary to what many think , the cost of both onshore and offshore wind power has not been coming down . 
On the contrary , it has been going up over the past decade . 
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change acknowledged this in its most recent renewable-energy report . 
Likewise , the UK Energy Research Center laments that wind-power costs have &quot; risen significantly since the mid-2000 &quot; s . &quot; 
Like the EU , the UK has become enamored with the idea of reducing CO2 through wind technology . 
The average of the major energy models indicates that , downscaled for the UK , achieving the 20 % target would imply a total cost of roughly £ 95 billion over the coming decade , and £ 18 billion every year after that . 
Of course , these figures include reductions in areas other than electricity , as well as higher energy prices &quot; total cost to the economy . 
Nonetheless , the lesson is clear : if the goal is not just to cut CO2 emissions , but also to use renewables to do it , the models show that the cost balloons to £ 188 billion for this decade and £ 36 billion every year after 2020 . 
In effect , insisting on wind power means using energy that is far from competitive , does not help to avert climate change , and costs an extra £ 92 billion for the UK alone . 
For any country , this seems like a very poor choice .
