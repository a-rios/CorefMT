Managing the Global Migration Crisis 
Debates about immigration nowadays tend to concentrate on the impact newcomers have on social cohesion . 
Advocates of a more open policy argue that populations are aging and workforces are diminishing , so greater immigration is needed to sustain high living standards . 
Their opponents focus on the disruptive effects of immigration , particularly among the most vulnerable citizens in countries that already suffer from high unemployment . 
But what is needed is a deeper and more global perspective than either side allows . 
Between 1800 and 1950 Europe &apos;s population increased by 269 % , from 203 million to 547 million , as the continent experienced extraordinary economic change , social upheaval , and political turmoil . 
Emigration from Europe was the continent &apos;s critical safety valve , without which the pressure placed on populations and states would have been unsustainable . 
During these 150 years , Europeans emigrated en masse to Latin America , driving its population up by 50 million , to North America , which saw an increase of 75 million , and to Oceania , where the population rose by 11 million . 
Surplus rural folk could find land to till in the New World &apos;s vast frontiers or industrial employment in its growing cities . 
The most adventurous and ambitious could seek fame and fortune in the colonies of Africa and Asia . 
But emigration was more than merely a safety valve ; it contributed to Europe &apos;s material and cultural wealth as well . 
The remittances of Italian seasonal laborers in Argentina prevented backward rural villages in southern Italy from slipping into grinding poverty . 
Markets throughout the world were opened to exports of European goods and capital . 
At the same time , major shifts began occurring in the Third World , and accelerated in the post-war decades : independence in India , liberation in China , decolonization in Asia and Africa , nation building and industrialization in Latin America . 
These changes fuel massive population increases . 
Between 1950 and 2050 , Africa &apos;s population is projected to soar by 800 % , from 221 million to nearly 1 . 
Even faster growth will take place in the coming decades . 
Between 2000 and 2010 , 700 million young people will enter developing country labor markets , more than the entire labor force of today &apos;s industrial world . 
The situation of Indonesia is revealing . 
Thirty percent of its population of 230 million is below age 15 , so Indonesia &apos;s economy needs to grow at 8 % simply to absorb the new workers . 
But Indonesia is currently growing at only about half that rate . 
Sociopolitical conditions in developing countries where demographic growth outpaces economic growth - the situation throughout the Middle East and North Africa - are bound to deteriorate rapidly in the years ahead . 
So today &apos;s entry barriers , particularly in Europe , will produce ever-increasing waves of illegal immigration , with all the crime , corruption , and suffering that this implies . 
Current trends point toward greater instability , including war . 
To manage this situation , no panaceas are on offer , and no miracles expected . 
The following prescriptions may , however , help avert a disaster : 
· Rich countries , particularly in Europe , must dismantle trade barriers to exports from developing countries and cease dumping subsidized agricultural products ; 
· OECD countries should honor the target of allocating the equivalent of 0.7 % of GDP annually to foreign aid ; 
· The volume of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in developing countries needs to be greatly increased and more evenly spread . 
About 80 % of FDI in developing countries worldwide goes to just five economies : China , Hong Kong , Korea , Brazil , and Mexico . 
The lesson of the last decade is that money flowing to constructive investments in developing countries would have yielded higher returns than all the Enrons , WorldComs , and Vivendis , while laying the basis for dynamic indigenous development ; 
· More emphasis must be placed on dramatically improving the quality of governance in developing countries . 
Wherever demographic growth outstrips economic growth , the fault lies primarily with corrupt and inefficient regimes and the obstacles they put in the way of entrepreneurship and wealth creation . 
As a result , wealthy Middle Easterners , for example , invest their capital in developed countries , not at home ; 
· Europe must open its doors far more widely . 
This is not merely a question of increasing the rate of legal immigration , but also of strengthening the quality of integration . 
If properly managed , the economic benefits will be significant both for the developing world ( higher remittances , but also greater opportunities for learning and experience ) and rich countries ( a younger , dynamic , and often entrepreneurial workforce ) . 
None of these tasks will be easy to accomplish . 
Otherwise , they risk plunging their citizens into a period of violence , destruction , and disintegration that could last several decades , and recall the horrors of the first half of the 20 th century .
