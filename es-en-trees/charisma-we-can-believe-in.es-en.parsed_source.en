Charisma We Can Believe In 
CAMBRIDGE - A leadership transition is scheduled in two major autocracies in 2012 . 
Neither is likely to be a surprise . 
Xi Jinping is set to replace Hu Jintao as President in China , and , in Russia , Vladimir Putin has announced that he will reclaim the presidency from Dmitri Medvedev . 
Among the world &apos;s democracies , political outcomes this year are less predictable . 
Nicolas Sarkozy faces a difficult presidential re-election campaign in France , as does Barack Obama in the United States . 
In the 2008 US presidential election , the press told us that Obama won because he had &quot; charisma &quot; - the special power to inspire fascination and loyalty . 
If so , how can his re-election be uncertain just four years later ? 
Can a leader lose his or her charisma ? 
Does charisma originate in the individual , in that person &apos;s followers , or in the situation ? 
Academic research points to all three . 
Charisma proves surprisingly hard to identify in advance . 
A recent survey concluded that &quot; relatively little &quot; is known about who charismatic leaders are . 
Dick Morris , an American political consultant , reports that in his experience , &quot; charisma is the most elusive of political traits , because it doesn &apos;t exist in reality ; only in our perception once a candidate has made it by hard work and good issues . &quot; 
Similarly , the business press has described many a CEO as &quot; charismatic &quot; when things are going well , only to withdraw the label when profits fall . 
Political scientists have tried to create charisma scales that would predict votes or presidential ratings , but they have not proven fruitful . 
Among US presidents , John F. Kennedy is often described as charismatic , but obviously not for everyone , given that he failed to capture a majority of the popular vote , and his ratings varied during his presidency . 
Kennedy &apos;s successor , Lyndon Johnson , lamented that he lacked charisma . 
That was true of his relations with the public , but Johnson could be magnetic - even overwhelming - in personal contacts . 
One careful study of presidential rhetoric found that even such famous orators as Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan could not count on charisma to enact their programs . 
Charisma is more easily identified after the fact . 
In that sense , the concept is circular . 
It is like the old Chinese concept of the &quot; mandate of heaven &quot; : emperors were said to rule because they had it , and when they were overthrown , it was because they had lost it . 
But no one could predict when that would happen . 
Similarly , success is often used to prove - after the fact - that a modern political leader has charisma . 
It is much harder to use charisma to predict who will be a successful leader . 
Followers are more likely to attribute charisma to leaders when they feel a strong need for change , often in the context of a personal , organizational , or social crisis . 
For example , the British public did not regard Winston Churchill as a charismatic leader in 1939 , but , a year later , his vision , confidence , and communication skills gave him charisma , given Britons &quot; anxiety after the fall of France and the Dunkirk evacuation . 
And then , in 1945 , after the public &apos;s focus had turned from winning the war to constructing a welfare state , Churchill was voted out of office . 
His charisma did not predict defeat ; the change in followers &quot; needs did . 
In practice , charisma is a vague synonym for &quot; personal magnetism . &quot; 
People vary in their ability to attract others , and their attraction depends partly on inherent traits , partly on learned skills , and partly on social context . 
Some dimensions of personal attraction , such as appearance and non-verbal communication , can be tested . 
Various studies show that people who are rated as attractive are treated more favorably than unattractive people . 
One study finds that a handsome man enjoys an edge over an ugly rival that is worth 6-8 % of the vote . 
For women , the advantage is close to ten points . 
Non-verbal signals account for a major part of human communications , and simple experiments have shown that some people communicate non-verbally better than others . 
For example , a Princeton University study found that when people were shown images of two candidates in unfamiliar elections , they could predict the winners seven times out of ten . 
A similar study at Harvard , in which people were shown 10-second silent video clips of 58 elections , found that viewers &quot; predictions explained 20 % of the variation in the two-party vote - a more powerful variable than economic performance . 
Ironically , the predictions became poorer when the sound was turned on . 
In the 2008 election , Americans felt disillusioned by the Bush administration &apos;s war in Iraq , and by the financial crisis that erupted two months before the vote . 
Obama was an attractive young candidate who spoke well and projected a sense of hope for the future . 
Clearly , this is one reason why Obama gained a reputation for charisma . 
But part of his charisma was in the eyes of his followers . 
People sometimes say of charisma that &quot; we know it when we see it , &quot; but we are also looking in a mirror . 
As the economy worsened , unemployment rose , and Obama had to deal with the messy compromises of governing , the mirror became cloudier . 
Charisma tells us something about a candidate , but it tells us even more about ourselves , the mood of our country , and the types of change we desire . 
Hard economic times make it difficult to maintain charisma . 
Obama faces the continuing challenges of unemployment and a recalcitrant Republican opposition , and Sarkozy must contend with similar problems . 
When they are campaigning , however , their rhetoric will be freed from the need to compromise . 
This year &apos;s elections will be the true test of their charisma .
