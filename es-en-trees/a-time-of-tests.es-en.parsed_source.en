A Time of Tests 
LONDON - This is a tough time to be a decision-maker . 
We live in an era of low predictability . 
The world appears in constant flux . 
The challenges are immense . 
And most of all , there is , in many instances a clash between the correct short term politics and the correct long term policy . 
On the economy , the climate debate and security , the immediate pressures pretty much run one way : increase the role of government in the economy ; put the climate deal off to more congenial financial times ; and get out of substantial military commitment to fighting global terrorism . 
Yet in each case the right long-term policy almost certainly points to the opposite course . 
What is the way to bridge this gap between short and long term ? 
To decide how to do that is to decide fundamentally what we believe in and what we want from our future . 
In deciding this , only the head can guide us in how to do it ; but the heart must tell us what it is we truly believe in doing . 
In the economy , the near universal conventional wisdom after the collapse of the banking system , was that the market had failed and the state had to step in . 
Old copies of John Kenneth Galbraith &apos;s The Great Crash of 1929 and Keynesian tracts were dusted off and avidly re-read . 
And it is true : the market did fail and the state had to step in . 
The fiscal and monetary stimuli were important in themselves , but even more so because they indicated that the strength of government was going to be utilised to prevent contagion and further collapse . 
But if we move to analysing what sort of recovery we can expect and what sort of future economy we are trying to fashion , it is by no means clear that we need a continuing , intrusive state role . 
On the contrary , we need the private sector to regain its sense of enterprise , innovation and vigour ; we need to be careful of regulating so as to squeeze the availability of credit ; and we should certainly avoid protectionism . 
True , the private sector will have much re-structuring to go through and the big deficits have been accumulated in the crisis must be unwound . 
In other words , the claim that &quot; the market failed &quot; is too alarmingly broad . 
Actually , one part of the market failed , but government and regulators were part of that failure . 
If we believe that this is true , it will ultimately be the creativity ( in the best sense ) of the private sector that will see us return to prosperity . 
So we need to make decisions in the coming weeks and months which help the private sector and not harm it . 
Likewise , in respect of the environment and energy , whatever the financial pressures , if we think that the earth &apos;s climate is probably changing as a result of human activity , we need to set the global economy on a low carbon path to the future . 
This doesn &apos;t mean that we can come out with unrealistic propositions as we struggle for a new global treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol . 
We should not make the best the enemy of the good . 
There are major things we can do on the basis of existing knowledge - on deforestation , energy efficiency and renewables - to make a big difference over the next decade . 
We will then require a long-term framework of incentives to develop the technologies of the future . 
But the point is : now is not the time to put off action . 
The seriousness of China on this issue , and now India , the enthusiasm of Brazil and others in the emerging markets to participate in tackling climate change : all of this offers a huge opportunity that should be grasped . 
And for the West , we should all remind ourselves about $ 100 a barrel oil . 
There are exemplary reasons of energy security why we need to change the nature of our economies to drive down carbon dependence . 
In security questions , the choices here are perhaps the hardest of all . 
A public , understandably disheartened by the length of the current military campaigns and loss of life in Afghanistan and Iraq , is sympathetic to the idea of disengagement . 
But this is also where , most of all , we need to decide what it is we truly believe in . 
The reason it is hard going in Afghanistan right now , for example , is that the forces we are facing are making it so . 
They are doing this by the use of terrorism and by brutal intimidation of the civilian population and in defiance of the expressed and plain will of the international community . 
Time and again what is clear is that people , given the chance , do want governments that are accountable , proper rule of law and the ability to choose their own destiny . 
Those using terror , whether in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq , Somalia , Yemen and the list could go on and on , do so to de-stabilise nations and to thwart the will of the people to live in peace . 
Disengaging now will not leave people free from our interference ; it will put them at the mercy of groups whose extremism threatens the very way of life that we stand for and to which they aspire . 
So no matter how difficult it is , we should remember what it is we believe in and why . 
So now is a moment , even amongst all the uncertainty , for some clarity and that clarity comes best from a worked out strategy based on a strong set of convictions .
