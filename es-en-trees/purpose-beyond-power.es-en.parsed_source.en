Purpose beyond Power 
BUDAPEST - The re-run of the Greek parliamentary election on June 17 is only the latest symptom of the most serious crisis to plague Western democracies and open societies since the 1960 &quot; s . 
Liberal democracies in the West today are struggling to avoid - and in doing so are exacerbating - a crisis of identity , which puts the existing social contract at risk and threatens their implosion . 
The end of the Cold War bequeathed our leaders with a new set of governance challenges , which promptly grew in magnitude , in large part owing to faster globalization , the consequences of the 1980 &quot; s economic liberalization , and the 1990 &quot; s revolution in information technology . 
These challenges , insufficiently addressed , soon led many to question the sustainability of liberal democracy &apos;s appeal at home and its universality abroad , and to probe the alleged merits of the &quot; Chinese model , &quot; best characterized as a form of authoritarian or state capitalism . 
The financial meltdown of 2008 , which soon metamorphosed into the deepest Western economic recession since the 1930 &quot; s , added fuel to the fire , as policymakers hunkered down in a non-transparent crisis-management mode , condoning massive state intervention in the economy and socialization of private-sector losses on a previously unprecedented scale . 
The resulting fiscal austerity plunged many below the poverty line and accelerated economic inequality , while many private institutions , having caused the 2008 bust , recovered on the public dime . 
Adding insult to injury , in Greece and Italy , two of the hardest-hit countries , financial markets effectively deposed elected , if imperfect , governments . 
The hapless former Greek prime minister , George Papandreou , had to resign last year after daring to suggest a referendum to decide the economic future of his fellow citizens . 
( Ironically , the upcoming election will de facto serve as the referendum that Papandreou suggested in October 2011 . ) 
At the root of the European crisis ( and its equivalent crisis in the United States ) is a shift in the configuration of economic , social , and political power . 
Liberal democracies and open societies have traditionally relied on a fine balance of these three forms of power . 
Over the last two decades , our elites have been unable to maintain it , as economic power has long since gone global and dislodged itself from political power , often corrupting democratic politics in the process . 
At the same time , social power , which provides the oxygen for democratic legitimacy , has been marginalized and disillusioned , and is increasingly turning away from the traditional transmission belts of politics . 
The result is an erosion of the stature of mainstream political parties and trade unions , and all-time low levels of trust in governments writ large . 
Powered by new media , identities are beginning to form around new networks of social interaction that often defy state boundaries and have little connection to liberal democracy &apos;s traditional institutions of governance . 
The refusal of today &apos;s elites to promote an effective balance of the three powers - to recognize a larger purpose beyond maximizing each individual power - has visibly translated into a waning regard for the public good . 
This has dramatic consequences for liberal democracy and open societies . 
With political power diminished ( and sometimes usurped ) by the transformation of its economic counterpart , and its detachment from its social base rendering it increasingly illegitimate , this is the hour of populists and extremists . 
We now see them feast on enfeebled democracies in many European countries , as fringe movements become serious contenders for power and threaten to wipe out the achievements of more than 60 years of European integration . 
In the US , the political system has descended into seemingly intractable partisan paralysis , gravely undermining the system of checks and balances and generating a deepening sense of malaise and frustration . 
We stand at a critical juncture . 
Recreating democracy and open societies in a global age requires investment in new ideas to rebalance political , economic , and social power at both the national and the global level . 
Nationally , we need to experiment with new mechanisms for policymaking and implementation , reconnecting democratic institutions to citizens and emerging networks of civil society . 
Globally , we must allow political and social power to establish their rightful place next to economic power . 
Mere tinkering will not do ; we need a transformation of the global institutional architecture . 
Unless we can establish a global socio-political space , we cannot legitimately deliberate over the provision of global public goods , let alone deliver them successfully . 
The push toward such a space needs to be spearheaded by risk takers - social and political entrepreneurs who are unafraid to work across lines traditionally dividing sectors and states , and who help to re-create a global community of purpose beyond power . 
The French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre once described the Berlin Wall as a mirror . 
In view of the Soviet system , it was indeed easy to overlook our own weakness and fallibilities . 
As the Wall came down , our elites struggled to maintain the fiction of an inherently imminent victory march for liberal democracy worldwide , now laid bare by the economic crisis on both sides of the Atlantic . 
We have lost two valuable decades to respond adequately to globalization and the crisis of liberal democracy and open societies . 
It is time to begin an honest reflection about power and its purpose in today &apos;s rapidly changing world .
