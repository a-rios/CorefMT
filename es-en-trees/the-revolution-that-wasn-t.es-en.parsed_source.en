The Revolution that Wasn &apos;t 
PARIS - It is May 1968 . 
The world , flabbergasted , discovers that France has gone crazy . 
A general strike , affecting everything except electricity and the press , brings the country to a halt . 
No developed country has ever known such a situation . 
Yet it isn &apos;t a revolution . 
There is little violence , and no attacks on government buildings . 
A few thousand cars do burn , but three years later , the police - who wanted to undermine the support that the public gave , almost unanimously , to the movement - will own up to being responsible for far more of them than the demonstrators . 
Then , after a month , everything goes back to normal . 
What happened ? 
It is 23 years since World War II &apos;s end . 
People remember that the Great Depression of 1929 , which made 20 million unemployed in six months , had brought Hitler to power . 
Capitalism is to blame for the war . 
Because it is vital to prevent that situation from recurring , an unwritten agreement has been forged to regulate capitalism : social stabilization through generalization of the welfare state , financial stabilization through Keynesian policies , and economic stabilization through high wage policies throughout the West . 
And it works . 
In this spring of 1968 , France , like every developed country , has experienced 23 years of fast and regular economic growth of 4.5-5 % per year . 
Sheltered from any economic crisis - because wiser capitalism has eliminated financial crisis - France has full employment . 
It &apos;s an incredible period . 
Nuclear deterrence ensures global peace . 
Economic growth has never been so fast over such a long period . 
Full employment has never been maintained for so long . 
Charles de Gaulle has governed France for 10 years . 
France &apos;s largest party , the Communists , dominates the opposition . 
The Socialist Party is paralyzed , ossified , and powerless . 
The opposition can &apos;t win . 
Nothing changes , and it seems that nothing ever will change in this quiet country where money rules . 
Regulated capitalism is a triumph everywhere . 
Economies appear to be on a stable , upward path . 
Success is measured by one &apos;s salary . 
Philosophers , notably Herbert Marcuse , denounce the venality of this way of life . 
People are bored ; they think it &apos;s immoral that money should become the world &apos;s main reference . 
Students protest , sometimes alongside trade unions , against the consumer society . 
Such debates enliven many American and French campuses . 
At the beginning of May , there are incidents at Nanterre University . 
The Sorbonne &apos;s students , supporting those from Nanterre , occupy their ancient university . 
There are protests on American campuses . 
In June , students will occupy the University of Stockholm . 
In the fall , there will be incidents at German and Italian universities as well . 
Nineteen sixty-eight is going global , fueled by doubt among university youth about the world that is being built . 
In Paris , a tired and awkward university rector asks the police to clear protesters from the Sorbonne . 
When the king of France created the Sorbonne in the thirteenth century , it was granted special privileges , one of which was maintaining order by itself ; the police were not allowed to enter the university &apos;s grounds . 
Only the Gestapo , during the Nazi occupation , had ever broken this rule . 
The consequences of the rector &apos;s decision are huge . 
All the students , in Paris and in the provinces - there are over a million at the time - feel insulted . 
Some of Nanterre University &apos;s leaders are jailed . 
All French universities go on strike to defend them . 
People don &apos;t understand how the government could have made this mistake . 
The &quot; Latin Quarter , &quot; the student district in Paris , sees a lot of protests . 
There are fights with the police . 
But nothing can prevent the movement from spreading . 
A huge march shows the trade unions &quot; support for the student movement . 
On May 15 , without any instruction from trade unions , some workers spontaneously decide to strike and occupy their factories at an aeronautics plant in Bouguenais , and at a Renault factory in Cl√©on . 
Strike committees , composed of young - and often non-union - workers , question hierarchy , demand respect , and want a &quot; right of free speech , &quot; but never mention wages - or even request negotiations . 
Trade unions don &apos;t know what to do . 
The CGT , close to the Communist party , fights the movement as vigorously as it can . 
The CFDT , formerly Christian but secularized in 1964 , understands the movement better and takes on its ideas . 
The strikes spread . 
There is still no violence . 
At first , the movement surprises the French public , which sympathizes with it . 
People help each other . 
It &apos;s a celebration of speech . 
Some ministers resign , but there is no attack against institutions . 
France is dreaming and having fun . 
On May 27 , the government organizes a meeting with trade union leaders , who have little to do with the strikes , and employers &quot; organizations , who have nothing at all to do with them . 
An important salary increase is decided , although it was never sought . 
Little by little , people go back to work . 
Prime Minister Georges Pompidou persuades de Gaulle - whose first speech , on May 24 , had no effect - to dissolve parliament on May 31 . 
An election campaign will keep the French occupied . 
The election at the end of June brings a big victory to the right-wing parties . 
The social consequences of May 1968 are nonetheless huge . 
It marks the beginning of the feminist movement . 
Everywhere outside Paris , calls for decentralization and regionalism grow . 
Trade union groups are , at last , officially recognized within businesses , as is workers &quot; right to speak out about their working conditions . 
The French have treated themselves to a month of crisis - more playful and poetic than social or political - to express their refusal of a world where money has too much influence . 
Much of an entire generation in the West feels the same way .
