Pakistan &apos;s Road to China 
ISLAMABAD - Large events sometimes have unintended strategic consequences . 
This is turning out to be the case following the killing of Osama bin Laden in a compound in Abbottabad , a military-dominated town near Islamabad , Pakistan &apos;s capital . 
The fact that the world &apos;s most wanted man lived for a half-dozen years in a large house within spitting distance of Pakistan Military Academy , where the country trains its officers , has provoked a reaction that Pakistanis should have expected , but did not . 
The country &apos;s civilian and military establishment has been surprised and troubled by the level of suspicion aroused by the events leading to Bin Laden &apos;s death - many Pakistanis call it &quot; martyrdom &quot; - and there is growing popular demand for a major reorientation of Pakistan &apos;s relations with the world . 
Unless the West acts quickly , Bin Laden &apos;s death is likely to result in a major realignment of world politics , driven in part by Pakistan &apos;s shift from America &apos;s strategic orbit to that of China . 
I have personal experience of how quickly China can move when it sees its &quot; all-weather friend &quot; ( Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Gilani &apos;s phrase ) in extreme distress . 
In 1996 , when Pakistan was near bankruptcy and contemplating default , I went to Beijing as the country &apos;s finance minister to ask for help . 
My years of service overseeing the World Bank &apos;s operations in China had put me in close contact with some of the country &apos;s senior leaders , including then-Prime Minister Zhu Rongji . 
At a meeting in Beijing , after telling me that China would not allow Pakistan to go bankrupt under my watch , Zhu ordered $ 500 million to be placed immediately in Pakistan &apos;s account with the Federal Reserve Bank in New York . 
That infusion of money enabled Pakistan to pay its bills while I was in charge of its economy . 
China seems to have adopted the same approach to Pakistan today , as the United States Congress threatens to cut off all aid . 
Gilani recently took a quick trip over the mountains to Beijing , and returned with an offer of immediate delivery of 50 fighter planes to Pakistan . 
Much more has been promised . 
Given China &apos;s record as a provider of aid to Pakistan , these promises will quickly be realized . 
In the meantime , Pakistan continues to pay the price for Bin Laden &apos;s death , with his supporters striking a town not far from Islamabad just days later , killing more than 80 people . 
That was followed by a brazen attack on a naval base in Karachi , in which some very expensive equipment , including aircraft , was destroyed . 
The terrorists struck for a third time two days later , killing a dozen people in a town near Abbottabad . 
The human toll continues to rise , as does the cost to the economy . 
On May 23 , the government issued an estimate of the economic cost of the &quot; war on terror &quot; that put the total at $ 60 billion , compared to the $ 20 billon the Americans have supposedly paid in compensation . 
In fact , a substantial share of the promised US aid has yet to arrive , particularly the part that is meant to rescue the economy from a deep downturn . 
While Gilani was in Beijing , Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh returned from Washington with empty hands . 
He had gone there to persuade the International Monetary Fund to release the roughly $ 4 billion that it was withholding from the $ 11 billion that Pakistan had been promised in late 2008 to save the country from defaulting on its foreign debt . 
The IMF &apos;s decision was in response to the Pakistani government &apos;s failure to take promised steps to increase its abysmal tax-to-GDP ratio , which stands at less that 10 % , one of the lowest levels in the emerging world . 
The Fund was right to insist that Pakistan stand on its own feet economically , but , in early June , Shaikh will present his 2011-2012 budget , in which he wants to ease the burden on ordinary Pakistanis . 
This has put Gilani &apos;s two-year-old government in a real bind . 
Whether Shaikh can balance the IMF &apos;s demands with ordinary people &apos;s needs will not only determine the Pakistani economy &apos;s direction , but will also have an enormous impact on how Pakistan and its citizens view the world . 
The only comfort that Pakistan has received from the West came in the form of assurances given by US President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron following Obama &apos;s state visit to London . 
In a joint press conference , both promised that their countries would stand with Pakistan &apos;s government and people . 
Pakistan , they said , was as deeply engaged as their countries in the war against terrorism . 
Pakistan will continue to receive American and British help . 
But the US and Britain find it difficult to move quickly , and strong voices in their capitals want Pakistan to be punished , not helped , for its wayward ways . 
In the meantime , China waits with open arms .
