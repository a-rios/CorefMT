Europe &apos;s Ungainly Banking Revolution 
BRUSSELS - Late last year , eurozone finance ministers reached a compromise on the basic elements of the Single Resolution Mechanism ( SRM ) - that is , how to deal with banks in difficulty . 
It looks ugly , but it also appears likely to work . 
The main ingredient of the compromise is to use , at least initially , separate national funds in case a bank needs to be saved , while also creating a common Single Resolution Fund ( SRF ) of up to € 55 billion ( $ 75 billion ) over the next ten years , which is to be financed by contributions from the banks themselves . 
The entire SRM would be run by a collection of national supervisors and representatives from the European Central Bank and the European Commission . 
The defects of this compromise are apparent . 
For starters , the SRM will not , at least at the beginning , be a &quot; single &quot; mechanism at all . 
National funds - and thus national authorities - will continue to be responsible for &quot; their &quot; banks &quot; problems , with the SRF &apos;s contribution to any rescue operation rising only gradually . 
It will be at least a decade from now - roughly the year 2025 - before the SRM is really &quot; single , &quot; with the use of separate national funds ending . 
That is , of course , a long transition period . 
But , because the ECB is in the process of conducting an asset-quality review of bank balance sheets , there is little danger that too many skeletons will remain in banks &quot; closets . 
Moreover , after five years ( by 2020 ) , the SRF could already have close to € 30 billion ( $ 40 billion ) available , more than most national funds , thus providing an important backstop should any national fund be insufficient . 
To be sure , it is not ideal that the SRM will cover only those banks - around 120 in total - that will come under the ECB &apos;s direct supervision at the end of this year . 
But this makes sense at the beginning , when the ECB will have its hands full getting a grip on the banks under its direct control ( which , in any case , constitute about four-fifths of the eurozone &apos;s banking system ) . 
Theoretically , the ECB is also the indirect supervisor of all of the thousand or so smaller banks in the eurozone , but it will take some time before this becomes effective . 
Another inelegant part of the proposed arrangement is that the SRF will not be part of the EU machinery ; instead , it will be established by an intergovernmental treaty ( now being rapidly negotiated among eurozone member countries ) . 
But this intergovernmental agreement is likely to be only a transitory solution . 
There have been other cases of major initiatives that started outside the legal framework set by the EU treaties , but that were later incorporated into the acquis communautaire ( the body of EU law ) , thus bringing them under the control of the Commission and the Parliament . 
This is what happened to the Schengen free-travel area , for example . 
The same is likely to happen with the SRF . 
The incredibly complicated decision-making process that has been proposed for the SRM , which , on paper at least , would involve more than 100 individual officials and many committees , is also unlikely to represent a real obstacle , as bank restructuring usually has to happen in a matter of days , typically over a weekend . 
The few who know the details of a particular case will make the key decisions , while the rest , with little knowledge of ( or stake in ) the matter , will be politely asked to go along . 
When the SRM and the SRF are brought back into the EU system , the decision-making mechanism will need to be revisited . 
The size of the SRF has often been criticized as being insufficient . 
But this is wrong : € 55 billion would be enough to deal with all but the very largest banks in Europe . 
It would also be sufficient to deal with a systemic crisis in small to medium-size countries like Ireland or Portugal . 
Even Spain needed &quot; only &quot; € 60 billion from the European Stability Mechanism at the peak of its crisis . 
In any event , a restructuring fund can be only a first-aid kit to deal with an isolated accident ( or two ) . 
Systemic crises always require a fiscal backstop . 
On this account , the SRM proposal is also incomplete . 
But at least the eurozone now has a permanent mechanism to support governments facing difficulties . 
While there is no explicit agreement , there can be little doubt that if a major crisis threatens to overwhelm the SRF , the funds needed to save the eurozone &apos;s banking system from collapse will be found , because all of the member states participating in the SRM will have an incentive to back up their common investment . 
The plan for the gradual constitution of a common resolution fund constitutes an awkward step in the right direction . 
It leaves as many problems unresolved as it addresses . 
But the end result is likely to be quite strong , because it establishes a key innovation : a common fund that effectively mutualizes much of the risk resulting from bank failures .
