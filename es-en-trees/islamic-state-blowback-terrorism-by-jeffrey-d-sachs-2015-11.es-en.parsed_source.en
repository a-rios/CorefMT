Ending Blowback Terrorism 
NEW YORK - Terrorist attacks on civilians , whether the downing over Sinai of a Russian aircraft killing 224 civilian passengers , the horrific Paris massacre claiming 129 innocent lives , or the tragic bombing in Ankara that killed 102 peace activists , are crimes against humanity . 
Their perpetrators - in this case , the Islamic State ( ISIS ) - must be stopped . 
Success will require a clear understanding of the roots of this ruthless network of jihadists . 
Painful as it is to admit , the West , especially the United States , bears significant responsibility for creating the conditions in which ISIS has flourished . 
Only a change in US and European foreign policy vis-Ã -vis the Middle East can reduce the risk of further terrorism . 
The recent attacks should be understood as &quot; blowback terrorism &quot; : a dreadful unintended result of repeated US and European covert and overt military actions throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Horn of Africa , and Central Asia that aimed to overthrow governments and install regimes compliant with Western interests . 
These operations have not only destabilized the targeted regions , causing great suffering ; they have also put populations in the US , the European Union , Russia , and the Middle East at significant risk of terror . 
The public has never really been told the true history of Osama bin Laden , Al Qaeda , or the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria . 
Starting in 1979 , the CIA mobilized , recruited , trained , and armed Sunni young men to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan . 
The CIA recruited widely from Muslim populations ( including in Europe ) to form the Mujahideen , a multinational Sunni fighting force mobilized to oust the Soviet infidel from Afghanistan . 
Bin Laden , from a wealthy Saudi family , was brought in to help lead and co-finance the operation . 
This was typical of CIA operations : relying on improvised funding through a wealthy Saudi family and proceeds from local smuggling and the narcotics trade . 
By promoting the core vision of a jihad to defend the lands of Islam ( Dar al-Islam ) from outsiders , the CIA produced a hardened fighting force of thousands of young men displaced from their homes and stoked for battle . 
It is this initial fighting force - and the ideology that motivated it - that today still forms the basis of the Sunni jihadist insurgencies , including ISIS . 
While the jihadists &quot; original target was the Soviet Union , today the &quot; infidel &quot; includes the US , Europe ( notably France and the United Kingdom ) , and Russia . 
At the end of the 1980s , with the Soviet retreat from Afghanistan , some elements of the Mujahideen morphed into Al Qaeda , Arabic for &quot; the base , &quot; which referred to the military facilities and training grounds in Afghanistan built for the Mujahideen by bin Laden and the CIA . 
After the Soviet withdrawal , the term Al Qaeda shifted meaning from the specific military base to the organizational base of jihadist activities . 
Blowback against the US began in 1990 with the first Gulf War , when the US created and expanded its military bases in the Dar al-Islam , most notably in Saudi Arabia , the home of Islam &apos;s founding and holiest sites . 
This expanded US military presence was anathema to the core jihadist ideology that the CIA had done so much to foster . 
America &apos;s unprovoked war on Iraq in 2003 unleashed the demons . 
Not only was the war itself launched on the basis of CIA lies ; it also aimed to create a Shia-led regime subservient to the US and anathema to the Sunni jihadists and the many more Sunni Iraqis who were ready to take up arms . 
More recently , the US , France , and the UK toppled Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya , and the US worked with the Egyptian generals who ousted the elected Muslim Brotherhood government . 
In Syria , following President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s violent suppression of peaceful public protests in 2011 , the US , Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and other regional allies helped to foment a military insurgency that has pushed the country into a downward spiral of chaos and violence . 
Such operations have failed - repeatedly and frequently disastrously - to produce legitimate governments or even rudimentary stability . 
On the contrary , by upending established , albeit authoritarian , governments in Iraq , Libya , and Syria , and destabilizing Sudan and other parts of Africa deemed hostile to the West , they have done much to fuel chaos , bloodshed , and civil war . 
It is this turmoil that has enabled ISIS to capture and defend territory in Syria , Iraq , and parts of North Africa . 
Three steps are needed to defeat ISIS and other violent jihadists . 
First , US President Barack Obama should pull the plug on CIA covert operations . 
The use of the CIA as a secret army of destabilization has a long , tragic history of failure , all hidden from public view under the agency &apos;s cloak of secrecy . 
Ending CIA-caused mayhem would go far to staunch the instability , violence , and anti-Western hatred that fuels today &apos;s terrorism . 
Second , the US , Russia , and the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council should immediately stop their infighting and establish a framework for Syrian peace . 
They have a shared and urgent stake in confronting ISIS ; all are victims of the terror . 
Moreover , military action against ISIS can succeed only with the legitimacy and backing of the UN Security Council . 
The UN framework should include an immediate end to the insurgency against Assad that the US , Saudi Arabia , and Turkey have pursued ; a Syrian cease-fire ; a UN-mandated military force to confront ISIS ; and a political transition in Syria dictated not by the US , but by a UN consensus to support a non-violent political reconstruction . 
Finally , the long-term solution to regional instability lies in sustainable development . 
The entire Middle East is beset not only by wars but also by deepening development failures : intensifying fresh water stress , desertification , high youth unemployment , poor educational systems , and other serious blockages . 
More wars - especially CIA-backed , Western-led wars - will solve nothing . 
By contrast , a surge of investment in education , health , renewable energy , agriculture , and infrastructure , financed both from within the region and globally , is the real key to building a more stable future for the Middle East and the world .
