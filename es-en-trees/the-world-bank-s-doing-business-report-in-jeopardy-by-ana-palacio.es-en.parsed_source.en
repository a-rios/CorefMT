The Importance of Doing Business 
MADRID - This month , an independent review panel is expected to release its findings regarding the World Bank &apos;s Doing Business report . 
Speculation abounds that the panel might recommend outsourcing Doing Business , removing its rankings of countries for the ease of doing business in them , or even eliminating the report altogether . 
This challenge is not a new one , as powerful World Bank shareholders have been trying to sink the project since its inception in 2002 . 
Now China , the world &apos;s second-largest economy and increasingly influential within the Bank , is seeking to water down the report by eliminating , among other things , its country rankings . 
But gutting or cutting Doing Business would be a grave error and would essentially result in throwing a healthy baby out with the bathwater . 
The 2013 report includes quantitative data grouped in 11 sets of indicators , ranging from the ease of starting a business to the availability of credit . 
The data are compared across economies and over time to rank 185 countries in ten categories of business regulation , such as &quot; Resolving Insolvency &quot; and &quot; Trading Across Borders . &quot; 
Input from respondents around the world - more than 9,600 this year - influences the report &apos;s conclusions . 
Doing Business is not intended to be a comprehensive review of each country &apos;s economy . 
Rather , it seeks to provide policymakers with benchmarks that can serve as a starting point for discussion of beneficial reforms . 
In fact , the report &apos;s simplicity is the key to its effectiveness . 
Doing Business has been a leader in synthesizing subjective and quantitative data to create understandable metrics . 
By limiting the total number of indicators studied and producing clear benchmarks , it helps policymakers to define their objectives and to improve the efficiency of regulation in crucial areas . 
Moreover , Doing Business helps to break down barriers - particularly in developing countries - that can discourage the establishment of small and medium-size enterprises , provide opportunities for corruption , and drive small business owners to the informal sector . 
For example , the data that Doing Business provides can help to generate the political will and public support needed to overcome opposition to competition-boosting measures from entrenched actors that have an interest in maintaining high entry barriers or procedural bottlenecks . 
The project has been a rare World Bank success , recording almost 2,000 reforms over the past decade , and has proved to be a valuable tool for policymakers in developing economies to spur reform and enhance investment . 
Rwanda , for example , has skyrocketed in the rankings , from 143rd in 2009 to 52nd in 2013 . 
Similarly , as Georgia has climbed to ninth in the rankings , its GDP has risen by more than 200 % and foreign investment inflows have increased by nearly 300 % since 2003 . 
Of all of the economies included in the report , only Zimbabwe and Venezuela have failed to maintain or improve their indicators since 2005 . 
But such success stories have not deterred the project &apos;s critics . 
Early criticism came from France , which vigorously objected to the 2004 and 2006 editions &quot; endorsement of the &quot; legal origins &quot; theory , which suggests that common-law countries benefit from greater regulatory efficiency than civil-law countries . 
China , like France in the past , objects to the perceived Anglo-American bias of Doing Business . 
Others criticize the report &apos;s methodology , claiming that the indicators are not inclusive or that they improperly measure countries &quot; regulatory environments . 
Still others have argued that Doing Business contains built-in biases against regulation and taxation , which may create incentives for countries to enact reforms that game the system rather than produce meaningful results . 
To be sure , not all of these objections are without merit ; there is certainly room for methodological improvement . 
That is why Doing Business adjusts its indicators every year based on feedback and review . 
For example , following criticism of the &quot; Employing Workers &quot; indicator , the International Finance Corporation ( the World Bank &apos;s private-sector lending arm ) conducted a review and removed it as a contributing factor to the rankings . 
A similar review should be carried out on other indicators , such as &quot; Paying Taxes , &quot; with any changes tailored to enable continued comparison across time , one of the project &apos;s main benefits . 
Given that the project &apos;s methodological flaws can be addressed with targeted review and reform , doing away with Doing Business altogether would be extreme and unnecessary . 
Countries like France , China , and India , dissatisfied with their low rankings , should not be allowed to eliminate or cripple the project . 
Indeed , outsourcing or cutting Doing Business could damage the World Bank &apos;s standing . 
Just last month , US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew trumpeted Doing Business in congressional testimony justifying American support for multilateral development banks . 
More broadly , backing away from such a project would undermine the Bank &apos;s promotion of rule-based systems and legal certainty - and would weaken the reformers in developing and emerging economies who seek to transform clientilist and patronage-based economies . 
Finally , while Doing Business focuses on helping the poorest countries to improve their economic performance , it also influences advanced-country policymaking and business practices . 
If the project is eliminated , European policymakers will be denied important information that could help to guide discussions about enhancing competitiveness . 
For example , registering property in Greece is more difficult than in Djibouti ; enforcing a contract in Italy takes roughly three times as long as it does in Vietnam ; and starting a business in Spain takes roughly 3.5 times longer than in Azerbaijan . 
Doing Business does not provide policy solutions . 
But it does provide a rigorous , credible framework for policy debate - and thus an opportunity that no economy can afford to lose .
