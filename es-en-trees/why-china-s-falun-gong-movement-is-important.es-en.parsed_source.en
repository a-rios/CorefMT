Why China \ u0027s Falun Gong Movement Is Important 
BEIJING : Continuing suppression of members of Falong Gong , a movement whose supporters continue to &quot; step forward &quot; to respond to their leader &apos;s call to &quot; achieve consummation by facing imprisonment or death , &quot; provides clear evidence that something new , if inexplicable , is happening in China . 
But there is a paradox here , for this &quot; something new &quot; is also something very old . 
It is precisely because this mass cult-turned-protest-movement has a traditional resonance that it poses such a threat to the Party establishment . 
When , in April 1999 , ten thousand members of the Falun Gong sect appeared mysteriously in front of Zhongnanhai , the compound of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s leadership , to be arrested en masse , observers found it hard to explain what was going on . 
The overseas press corps in Beijing was used to explaining political dissidents , student protesters , disgruntled workers and disenfranchised members of the &quot; floating population . &quot; 
This mystical , crypto Buddhist / Taoist sect of middle class meditators , however , seemed to arise out of nowhere so that its origins and seriousness as a threat to China &apos;s Party establishment were difficult to assess . 
The group , it turned out , was led by an exiled patriarch , Li Hongzhi , who had conjured his cult out of traditional Chinese breathing exercises ( qigong ) , a belief in miracle cures , nostrums about clean living , and a mish-mash of Buddhist and Taoist mysticism . 
As wave after wave of Falun Gong supporters arrived in Tiananmen Square to be arrested , however , what began as an aberrant event became the most widespread movement of organized protest in China since 1989 . 
When , like the Tianamen Square demonstrators , it met with an uncompromising government counter-attack , it soon became obvious that , however strange and fantastic its followers might seem from the outside , Party leaders viewed the movement as a menace They labeled it a xiejiao zuzhi , literally a &quot; heretical &quot; or &quot; depraved &quot; organization , a term of denigration long-reserved for &quot; unorthodox &quot; religious or spiritual groups based on superstition . 
What makes Falun Gong so threatening is that not only is it led by a very traditionalistic leader , but that its mystical doctrine and charismatic rebelliousness evoke for Chinese an ingrained sense of historical memory of past ruling dynasties that fell after being challenged by a similar internal millenarian movement . 
For Chinese , such cultic movements have deep symbolic significance because of their association with the idea of dynastic decay and collapse . 
Few Chinese do not know legends and stories from history , which are passed down through the generations in novels , operas , plays and now films , comic books and even TV series . 
These stories tell of how the Han Dynasty &apos;s ( 206 B.C-422 A.D ) end was presaged by the mystical Yellow Turban Rebellion or of how the Qing Dynasty ( 1644-1911 ) , China &apos;s last , ran afoul of the equally mystical White Lotus and then the Boxer Rebellions . 
Cult-animated uprisings against unjust authority , with which Falun Gong is now identified , have always been viewed by Chinese as portents that political legitimacy  -  sanctioned by the so-called &quot; mandate of heaven &quot; ( tianming ) that is said to exist when &quot; heaven &quot; confers its favor on a ruling dynasty  -  has been withdrawn . 
For a government such as that now ruling China , one which does not derive legitimacy from the will of the people , the deeply rooted cultural presumption of ordinary people that the cosmic forces of heaven no longer shine on it , could deal a devastating psychological blow . 
So , Falung Gong is viewed as an ominous threat to Party hegemony , perhaps even more ominous than any previous protest movement . 
There are four reasons for this : 
 because it has deep traditional and nativist Chinese roots , Falung Gong &apos;s message cannot be branded as an imported and inappropriate foreign ideology in the way that notions of democracy and Christianity are dismissed by Chinese nationalists and xenophobes ; 
 because the destruction of traditional Confucian values during Mao &apos;s revolution and then the implosion of Marxist ideology during Deng Xiaoping &apos;s economic reform era left China bereft of a coherent belief system , many Chinese are susceptible to any group that offers basic answers to questions about the meaning of life ; 
 unlike student protesters who were basically rationalists and usually had clear demands to which the Party could respond ( if it wished ) , Li Hongzhi &apos;s critique that contemporary Chinese life has fallen into a morass of immorality and venality brooks no easy response ; 
 because this diffuse but mass-based sect communicates with its members by word of mouth and over the Internet rather than by conventional means , it is difficult for the Party to disrupt its nerve centers . 
In this sense Falun Gong is a double paradox : a traditionalistic movement freighted with deep historical symbolism , it is also a cyber-savvy , modern Chinese protest movement . 
Nothing in China ever seems to happen quite in the way China experts predict . 
Virtually no expert foresaw the events of 1989 ; no expert whom I know imagined that China &apos;s next wave of destabilizing protest might come from a mass movement of superstitious middle-aged , middle-class citizens dedicated to recycled notions of Buddhist and Taoist clean living , health through meditation , breathing exercises and mysticism spread via the Internet . 
By detaining thousands of sect followers the Party may unwittingly transform an errant spiritual movement into a dangerous political force .
