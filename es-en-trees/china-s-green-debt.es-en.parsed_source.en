China &apos;s Green Debt 
For a decade , the world has wondered when China &apos;s leaders will recognize the staggering environmental crisis confronting their country . 
This year , we got an answer : a new Five-Year Plan that makes environmental protection a priority . 
A storm of green propaganda has followed , and the government now talks about using &quot; Green GDP &quot; to measure development . 
But will all this talk amount to real progress ? 
While the central government admits to some of the environmental degradation caused by rapid economic growth , the picture it paints is incomplete . 
Consider &quot; Green GDP . &quot; 
This spring , the State Environmental Protection Administration produced the country &apos;s first official estimate of GDP adjusted downward for environmental losses . 
According to these calculations , it would cost $ 84 billion to clean up the pollution produced in 2004 , or 3 % of GDP for that year . 
But more realistic estimates put environmental damage at 8-13 % of China &apos;s GDP growth each year , which means that China has lost almost everything it has gained since the late 1970 &quot; s due to pollution . 
China &apos;s environmental problems , complex as the causes may be , can ultimately be attributed to our understanding of Marxism . 
For most of our recent history , we saw in Marxism only a philosophy of class struggle . 
We believed that economic development would solve all our problems . 
In the reform period , this misreading of Marx morphed into an unrestrained pursuit of material gain devoid of morality . 
Traditional Chinese culture , with its emphasis on harmony between human beings and nature , was thrown aside . 
As a result , China &apos;s economy is dominated by resource-hungry and inefficient polluters , such as coal and mineral mines , textile and paper mills , iron and steel makers , petrochemical factories , and building material producers . 
Our cities are exploding in size , depleting water resources and creating horrific traffic congestion . 
One-quarter of China &apos;s people drink substandard water ; one-third of urbanites breathe badly polluted air . 
Moreover , the country recently witnessed a spate of environmental accidents . 
Indeed , on average , China suffers a major water pollution accident every other day . 
Although China has signed the Kyoto Protocol and some 50 other international environmental accords , we do little to honor them . 
If we are not serious about upgrading our industrial structure , we will fail when it comes time to fulfill our commitments to cut emissions . 
And while the new Five-Year Plan sets fine goals , many provinces have failed even to meet the major environment protection targets of the last Five-Year Plan . 
True , China has made the kind of economic advances in three decades that required 100 years in Western countries . 
But China also has suffered a century &apos;s worth of environmental damage in 30 years . 
Unfortunately , unlike Western countries , we cannot afford to wait until our per capita annual GDP reaches $ 10,000 before tackling our environmental problems . 
Our experts predict that the environmental crisis will intensify to a critical stage by the time China &apos;s per capita annual GDP reaches just $ 3,000 . 
Making matters worse , while we discarded the finer elements of our traditional culture , we failed to absorb the better aspects of modern civilization . 
The concept of a &quot; social contract &quot; based on rights and obligations - the essential values that constitute the most important precondition for effective environmental protection - goes largely ignored . 
As a result , environmental protection projects often fail to be included in calculating production costs . 
Scarcely anyone bothers to consider the environmental costs to - or rights of - the country &apos;s poor and powerless . 
It is imperative that environmental factors figure in China &apos;s macroeconomic planning in a real way . 
This requires that a more rational strategy be mapped out in the planning of major industrial projects and energy-hungry enterprises . 
Careful studies need to be done to determine available energy , land , mineral , and biological resources before projects proceed . 
Land planning must be overhauled , with industrial monopolies broken up and development goals set according to population , resource volume , and the capacity to absorb pollution . 
Finally , China needs a new energy strategy . 
Industrialized nations have developed and made great use of nuclear , solar , wind , and bio-gas , and other renewable energy resources . 
China &apos;s technological capacities in this sector lag behind even other developing nations such as India and Pakistan , and its reliance on coal is one of the greatest threats to the global climate . 
For now , there is simply no alternative . 
But in the long run , clean energy will be the only way to bring economic growth without doing irreparable environmental damage . 
Government cannot solve these problems on its own . 
China &apos;s people have the biggest stake in environmental protection , and so must become the driving force . 
Local communities , non-governmental organizations , and businesses all must do their part . 
They cannot limit themselves simply to &quot; supervision &quot; and appeals to the authorities . 
They must expand into other avenues of appeal : public hearings , welfare lawsuits , enhanced media coverage , and other voluntary activities . 
But ultimate power does rest with the government . 
China &apos;s leaders need to make several concrete moves in order to move beyond rhetoric . 
They must give real power to environmental officials to implement existing laws and close gaping legal loopholes . 
This can only be done by introducing legal mechanisms to reward those who protect the environment , while making polluters pay , and by helping to unify the environmental watchdogs scattered across different sectors . 
Above all , a system needs to be established to monitor officials &quot; performance in environmental as well as in economic terms . 
China is dangerously near a crisis point . 
The country &apos;s enormous environmental debt will have to be paid , one way or another . 
China must exercise the foresight needed to begin paying this debt now , when it is manageable , rather than allowing it to accumulate and , ultimately , threaten to bankrupt us all .
