A Europe of Solidarity , Not Only Discipline 
BERLIN - Originally , the European Union was what psychologists call a &quot; fantastic object , &quot; a desirable goal that inspires people &apos;s imaginations . 
I saw it as the embodiment of an open society - an association of nation-states that gave up part of their sovereignty for the common good and formed a union dominated by no one nation or nationality . 
The euro crisis , however , has turned the EU into something radically different . 
Member countries are now divided into two classes - creditors and debtors - with the creditors in charge . 
As the largest and most creditworthy country , Germany occupies a dominant position . 
Debtor countries pay substantial risk premiums to finance their debt , which is reflected in their high economy-wide borrowing costs . 
This has pushed them into a deflationary tailspin and put them at a substantial - and potentially permanent - competitive disadvantage vis-Ã -vis creditor countries . 
This outcome does not reflect a deliberate plan , but rather a series of policy mistakes . 
Germany did not seek to occupy a dominant position in Europe , and it is reluctant to accept the obligations and liabilities that such a position entails . 
Call this the tragedy of the European Union . 
Recent developments seem to offer grounds for optimism . 
The authorities are taking steps to correct their mistakes , especially with the decision to form a banking union and the outright monetary transactions program , which would allow unlimited intervention by the European Central Bank in the sovereign-bond market . 
Financial markets have been reassured that the euro is here to stay . 
That could be a turning point , provided it is adequately reinforced with additional steps toward greater integration . 
Unfortunately , the EU &apos;s unfolding tragedy characteristically feeds on such glimmers of hope . 
Germany remains willing to do the minimum - and nothing more - to hold the euro together , and the EU &apos;s recent steps have merely reinforced German resistance to further concessions . 
A widening gap in economic performance and political dominance is such a dismal prospect for the EU that it must not be allowed to become permanent . 
There must be a way to prevent it - after all , history is not predetermined . 
The EU , originally conceived as an instrument of solidarity , is today held together by grim necessity . 
The only way to reverse the trend is to recapture the spirit of solidarity that animated the European project from the start . 
To that end , I recently established an Open Society Initiative for Europe ( OSIFE ) . 
In doing so , I recognized that the best place to start would be where current policies have created the greatest human suffering : Greece . 
The people who are suffering are not those who abused the system and caused the crisis . 
The fate of the many migrant and asylum seekers caught in Greece is particularly heart-rending . 
An initiative confined to migrants would merely reinforce the growing xenophobia and extremism in Greece . 
I could not figure out how to approach this seemingly intractable problem until I recently visited Stockholm to commemorate the centenary of Raoul Wallenberg &apos;s birth . 
This reawakened my memories of World War II - the calamity that eventually gave birth to the EU . 
Wallenberg was a hero who saved the lives of many Jews in my home city of Budapest by establishing Swedish safe houses . 
During the German occupation , my father was also a heroic figure . 
He helped to save his family and friends and many others . 
He taught me to confront harsh reality rather than to submit to it passively . 
That is what gave me the idea . 
We could set up solidarity houses in Greece , which would serve as community centers for the local population and also provide food and shelter to migrants . 
There are already many soup kitchens and civil-society efforts to help the migrants , but these initiatives cannot cope with the scale of the problem . 
What I have in mind is to reinforce these efforts . 
The EU &apos;s asylum policy has broken down . 
Refugees must register in the member country where they enter , but the Greek government cannot process the cases . 
Some 60,000 refugees who sought to register have been put into detention facilities where conditions are inhumane . 
Migrants who do not register and live on the street are attacked by the hooligans of the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party . 
Sweden has made migration and asylum policy a high priority , while Norway is concerned about the fate of migrants in Greece . 
So both countries would be prime candidates to support solidarity houses . 
OSIFE is ready to provide support for this initiative , and I hope other foundations will be eager to do the same . 
Currently , Golden Dawn is making political headway by providing social services to Greeks while attacking migrants . 
The initiative that I propose would offer a positive alternative , based on solidarity - the solidarity of Europeans with Greeks and of Greeks with migrants . 
It would provide a practical demonstration of the spirit that ought to infuse the entire EU . 
As soon as possible , I will dispatch an OSIFE needs-assessment team to Greece to contact the authorities - and the people and organizations already helping the needy - to work out a plan for which we can generate public support . 
My goal is to revive the idea of the EU as an instrument of solidarity , not only of discipline .
