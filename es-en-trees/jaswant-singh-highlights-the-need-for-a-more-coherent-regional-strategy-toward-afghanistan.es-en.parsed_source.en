The Afghan Muddle 
NEW DELHI - Despite some last-minute brinkmanship by Afghan President Hamid Karzai , the United States and Afghanistan seem to have worked out a bilateral security agreement to govern the 8,000-10,000 ( mostly American ) troops that will remain in Afghanistan from next year . 
But Afghanistan remains a source of significant uncertainty - and high anxiety - in an already unstable region . 
Although the Afghan army has performed surprisingly well this year as it has prepared to assume full responsibility for the country &apos;s security , governments in the region remain deeply skeptical of its ability to resist a resurgent Taliban without the strong support that the US has provided . 
But the Americans are intent on withdrawal , and no other country is willing to assume the responsibilities that they are relinquishing . 
In this context , the fear that Afghanistan will unravel once again risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
In fact , a closer look at various key governments &quot; approaches to Afghanistan reveals that only the US is maintaining a coherent stance . 
Pakistani policy is practically at war with itself . 
Since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 , Pakistan has viewed the country as a source of &quot; strategic depth &quot; in its decades-old enmity with India . 
As a result , it has been playing both sides of the US-Taliban conflict , permitting US drone strikes against Afghan Taliban leaders hiding in its western provinces but making little effort to confront the Taliban on the ground . 
This way , the logic went , Pakistan could retain enough influence with the Taliban to secure leverage over Afghanistan &apos;s government . 
But it is the Taliban that ultimately gained strategic depth in its Pakistan-based guerrilla war with Afghanistan - a war that has become a serious threat to Pakistan &apos;s security . 
The Pakistani Taliban has killed hundreds of Pakistani soldiers this year . 
And Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &apos;s new strategy - to seek a non-interference agreement with the Pakistani Taliban - will probably lead to even more domestic insecurity . 
Meanwhile , India has been attempting to counter-balance Pakistan &apos;s influence with the Taliban by providing investment , military training , aid , and other support to the Afghan government . 
But this amounts to betting all of its chips on one hand , the Afghan government - an especially risky strategy in such a volatile environment . 
China &apos;s Afghan policy also has its pitfalls . 
The People &apos;s Republic has invested billions of dollars in Afghanistan , including a $ 3 billion payment for rights to mine copper at Mes Aynak . 
Although the Chinese have offered rhetorical support for international forces &quot; anti-terror efforts in Afghanistan , they have refused even the smallest military role . 
And they have provided only about $ 250 million in aid over the last decade - a paltry sum , given the potential consequences of Afghan instability for China &apos;s $ 6 trillion economy . 
To be sure , China claims to be upholding its doctrine of non-interference in other countries &quot; domestic affairs . 
But , with the Afghan government asking the entire international community for assistance , Chinese aid would not violate this principle . 
Moreover , China &apos;s hands-off policy could end up jeopardizing its investments in Afghanistan - not to mention the security threat that would arise were a re-empowered Taliban to provide aid or sanctuary to the increasingly Islamist Uighur separatists in China &apos;s Xinjiang region . 
Iran &apos;s Afghan policy has been reflexively anti-American for much of the last decade . 
But back in 2001 , Iran &apos;s government , led by reformist President Mohammad Khatami , essentially consented to the US invasion of Afghanistan , even providing discreet assistance . 
Iran was scrupulous in closing its border to the Taliban - and about detaining Taliban and Al Qaeda figures who sought refuge . 
Indeed , it was Iran that first suggested that Karzai lead the newly formed Afghan government , and Khatami &apos;s government pledged $ 560 million in assistance over five years at the first donor conference for Afghanistan in early 2002 . 
But US President George W. Bush &apos;s notorious &quot; axis of evil &quot; speech - delivered just days later , and citing Iran as one of America &apos;s three most dangerous enemies - spurred a reversal of Iranian policy . 
Khatami &apos;s successor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , repeatedly condemned the presence of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan , and even worked to obstruct their efforts . 
One hopes that the recent agreement concerning Iran &apos;s nuclear program portends a return to a more flexible Iranian policy toward Afghanistan - essential if there is to be a regional solution to Afghanistan &apos;s problems . 
Given America &apos;s looming departure , such a solution is becoming increasingly urgent . 
But reaching a regional consensus will not be easy , given the disparate nature and interests of the regimes involved . 
Iran , China , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan are all dictatorships - one religious , one market-communist , and two personal . 
India is a democracy , and Pakistan a wayward democracy . 
Nearby Russia is increasingly a one-man-show under President Vladimir Putin , who seems intent on refighting the Cold War with the US , rather than constructing viable strategic relationships that reflect Russia &apos;s diminished reality . 
Nonetheless , all of these countries ( perhaps with the admittedly large exception of Pakistan ) can agree on certain core objectives . 
First , Afghanistan must not become a safe haven for terrorists . 
Mullah Mohammed Omar - the Taliban &apos;s leader , who is reportedly in hiding in Pakistan - must understand that if the Taliban uses any formal political influence it gains in Afghanistan to support terrorist activities , it will face united regional opposition . 
Second , given their limited leverage , Afghanistan &apos;s neighbors must lean hard on countries that can influence any future Afghan government . 
The Gulf states , for example , have the means to invest in building an Afghanistan that provides real opportunities to all citizens - particularly the young men whose lack of options so often drives them into the arms of terrorist recruiters . 
Realistically , however , the potential for achieving such an outcome is limited . 
Most important , Afghanistan &apos;s neighbors must not play power politics within the country , in the hope of gaining some slight advantage over one another . 
That path , as we have seen , leads only to chaos , from which no country benefits .
