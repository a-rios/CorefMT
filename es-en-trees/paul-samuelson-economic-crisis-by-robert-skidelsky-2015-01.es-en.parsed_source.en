The Fall of the House of Samuelson 
LONDON - To read The Samuelson Sampler in the shadow of the Great Recession is to gain a glimpse into the mindset of a bygone era . 
The sample is of the late Paul Samuelson &apos;s weekly columns for the magazine Newsweek from 1966-1973 . 
Samuelson , a Nobel laureate , was the doyen of American economists : his famous textbook , Economics went through 14 editions in its author &apos;s lifetime , introducing future economists worldwide to the rudiments of their craft . 
If not the sole originator , he was the great popularizer of the &quot; neoclassical synthesis &quot; - the mix of neoclassical and Keynesian economics that defined the mainstream of the field for 50 years . 
Samuelson was a convinced Keynesian , though in a limited sense . 
He dismissed most of Keynes &apos;s attack on the orthodox economics of his day as unnecessary , writing &quot; had Keynes &#91; started &#93; with the simple statement that he found it realistic to assume that money wages &amp; hellip ; were sticky and resistant to downward movements ... most of his insights would have remained just as valid . &quot; 
For Samuelson , Keynes &apos;s real contribution was the tools he gave governments to prevent depressions . 
Reading The Samuelson Sampler , it is extraordinary to realize just how confident economists of his generation were that the New Economics ( as the Keynesian approach was called in America ) had solved the problem of depression and mass unemployment . 
As Samuelson put it in his 1973 introduction , &quot; the specter of a repetition of the depression of the 1930s has been reduced to a negligible probability . &quot; 
Yes , there would still be small fluctuations ; but , as he wrote in 1966 , &quot; Great Depressions - cumulative slumps that feed on themselves - are indeed extinct . &quot; 
The reason was that governments now had the tools , especially discretionary fiscal policy , to check any incipient downturn . 
&quot; What is important about the budget , &quot; he said in 1970 , &quot; is whether it is inflationary or deflationary , not whether &#91; it is &#93; balanced or unbalanced . &quot; 
In other words , &quot; A deficit in a good cause is good business . &quot; 
How many economists or politicians believe this today ? 
Because governments knew how to stop depressions , voters would insist that they use this knowledge . 
&quot; If printing bits of green can save banks and business from ruin , &quot; he argued in 1966 , &quot; today &apos;s electorate will ensure that either party in power will &#91; so &#93; act . &quot; 
This was irrespective , Samuelson thought , of the ideological preferences of those in power . 
The Republican Richard Nixon was elected US President in 1968 on a platform of scaling down the Democrats &quot; expensive Great Society programs . 
&quot; I am not an economic determinist , &quot; Samuelson wrote in November 1968 , &quot; But I can predict with confidence that Richard Nixon will be using the New Economics if only for the reason that new times make it inescapable . &quot; 
And so it turned out . 
Rather than deflating the economy , Nixon took America off the gold standard in 1971 and imposed wage , price , and import controls , proclaiming bluntly , &quot; I am now a Keynesian in economics . &quot; 
But that was the last of Samuelson &apos;s successful predictions . 
Less than a decade after his Newsweek columns ended , the New Economics , which he had extolled as a permanent addition to knowledge , was in flight from the ideological assaults of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher . 
Despite his faith that voters would not allow a return to depression , Thatcher &apos;s third election victory , in 1987 , came just after unemployment in the United Kingdom had peaked at three million , the highest level since the 1930s . 
So what went wrong ? 
&quot; Still to be argued out within the guild &#91; of economists &#93; , &quot; Samuelson wrote in 1969 , &quot; is the proper quantitative potency of monetary versus fiscal policy . &quot; 
This question eventually was resolved in favor of monetary policy . 
More important , as he pointed out in 1970 , was that &quot; even Keynes could not guarantee that mankind would live happily ever after . 
He left us with an unsolved problem . 
How can we have full employment and also price stability ? &quot; 
Reluctantly , Samuelson concluded that there needed to be permanent controls over prices and wages to stop cost-push inflation . 
&quot; Our mixed economy , &quot; he wrote in 1970 , &quot; does not know how to have a satisfactory incomes policy that will back up monetary and fiscal policy .... Here then lies the unsolved frontier in modern economics . &quot; 
It was the same frontier that Friedrich von Hayek first surveyed in The Road to Serfdom in 1944 . 
Hayek feared that deliberate policies to maintain full employment would lead to increasing state encroachment on the free market and political liberty . 
It was this fear that led , from the 1980s onwards , to the piecemeal abandonment of the policy system of the mixed economy - indeed , to the dismantling of the mixed economy itself . 
Samuelson was half right : Governments do know how to stop a slide into another Great Depression . 
They used this knowledge in the autumn of 2008 and 2009 , which is why we had only a Great Recession . 
But , contrary to what Samuelson believed , governments are haunted by fears of large fiscal deficits . 
With few exceptions , they have not been prepared to use fiscal policy to jolt their economies out of post-crisis stagnation . 
Instead , they have relied on monetary expansion , which is politically more acceptable , but also much weaker in its effects , as it is undermined - just as Keynes predicted - by &quot; several slips between the cup and the lip . &quot; 
More important , governments have abandoned the goal of full employment ; as a result , all of those bits of interventionist policy previously thought necessary to keep economic activity on an even keel have gone by the wayside as well . 
The New Economics may be temporarily resurrected to deal with extreme situations , but policymakers no longer take precautions to prevent extreme situations from arising . 
How to do this , while preserving freedom and efficiency , is now the &quot; unsolved frontier in modern economics . &quot;
