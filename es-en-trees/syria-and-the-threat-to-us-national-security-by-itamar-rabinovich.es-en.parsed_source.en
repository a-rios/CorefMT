Defusing the Syrian Time Bomb 
TEL AVIV - It is remarkable that a stern warning about the scale of the threat posed to the United States by Syria &apos;s civil war has gone practically unnoticed . 
Is President Barack Obama &apos;s administration stumbling toward the abyss ? 
Earlier this month , the Wall Street Journal reported that , according to the CIA &apos;s deputy director , Michael Morell , &quot; Syria &apos;s volatile mix of Al Qaeda extremism and civil war now poses the greatest threat to US national security &quot; - indeed , &quot; probably the most important issue in the world today . &quot; 
By contrast , Morell described the Iranian regime &apos;s &quot; merging of ... nuclear ambitions with its desire to be a hegemonic power in the Middle East &quot; as a mere &quot; cause for concern . &quot; 
Morell , who is preparing to step down from the CIA soon , has little reason to dissemble . 
Just two months ago , in mid-June , when the Syrian crisis was the focus of international attention and the subject of heated policy debate , such a statement by a senior administration official would have drawn strong reactions from several quarters . 
The apparent ( and deceptive ) lull in the fighting in Syria has contributed to this shift . 
After the government &apos;s military achievements in Quseir and Homs , there has been some tactical regrouping by the opposition . 
Both sides are trading minor blows as they prepare for a major round of fighting in Aleppo , Syria &apos;s largest city , now held by the opposition . 
Overall , and despite the regime &apos;s recent victories , the fighting remains at a stalemate . 
So this is a convenient time for the international community to look away from a crisis that seems to have no good solutions . 
As Morell put it , the most acute danger is that a regime with a large stockpile of weapons of mass destruction will be supplanted by a regime affiliated with , or dominated by , Al Qaeda . 
Pointing to the inflow of jihadis , Morell said that Syria &apos;s &quot; current track is toward the collapse of its central government , &quot; after which it would replace Pakistan as Al Qaeda &apos;s preferred haven . 
Morell thus placed himself squarely within one of the two principal schools of thought in the policy debate on Syria ( a debate that is articulated almost exclusively in geopolitical terms and ignores humanitarian issues ) . 
One school regards Syria primarily as a theater of battle against Al Qaeda and other extremists . 
Its adherents , preoccupied with the prospect of a jihadi takeover in Syria , argue ( sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly ) that the US and its allies must not support or intervene on the side of the rebels and , in fact , should view Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime as the lesser evil . 
Those who fear a jihadi takeover cite recent events in Sinai . 
Just a few days ago , Israel closed its airport in Eilat after receiving a warning that jihadis in Sinai planned to attack it with rockets . 
This , it is argued , is only a dress rehearsal for what can be expected in a post-Assad Syria . 
The other school of thought does not take this scenario lightly . 
Nonetheless , it argues that a victory in Syria by a coalition of Russia , Iran , Hezbollah , and Assad &apos;s regime would pose an even greater danger . 
Moreover , in the event of the Assad regime &apos;s fall , there would be plenty of ways to deal with the jihadi groups in Syria . 
But the most appropriate response to Morell &apos;s statement is that the US does not necessarily have to choose between two sharply defined options . 
Yes , Syria &apos;s secular opposition is weak and divided , while the jihadis are more dynamic ; but jihadi supremacy in the event of an opposition victory is not inevitable . 
The US and its allies should conduct a robust policy , make a more significant investment in the secular opposition , and articulate clear goals . 
In June , Obama announced that Assad &apos;s regime had used chemical weapons against its own population and had thus crossed his administration &apos;s &quot; red line . &quot; 
For Obama , Syria &apos;s fate simply does not seem urgent ; but when the decisive battle for Aleppo begins , it may be too late . 
Morell &apos;s warnings may yet be vindicated - by default , if not by design .
