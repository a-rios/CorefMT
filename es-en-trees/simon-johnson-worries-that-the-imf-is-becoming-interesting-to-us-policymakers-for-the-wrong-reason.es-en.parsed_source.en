The Importance of Being Boring 
WASHINGTON , DC - The International Monetary Fund is an immensely useful organization , able to deliver substantial amounts of financial and technical assistance at short notice to almost any place in the world . 
It also has the great advantage of almost always being perceived as incredibly boring . 
Unfortunately for the IMF , it now needs a slightly higher public profile to convince the US Congress to agree to some important reforms . 
The Ukrainian crisis may prove helpful , though that appears less likely now - which may be a good thing to the extent that one unintended consequence could be a loan to Ukraine that is larger than it really needs . 
In the realm of international economics , being perceived as boring confers power to the extent that it allows major decisions to be made without a great deal of external scrutiny . 
From 1918 to 1939 , international economic cooperation was hard to come by - in large part because all of the attempted deals were put together at high-profile international conferences . 
Following the creation of the IMF in 1944 , many of the same decisions became routine , a lot less interesting , and much easier to implement . 
The IMF rarely makes front-page headlines in the United States or other big countries , except when there is a racy personal dimension . 
The last time that many read a news story about the Fund may have been when then-Managing Director Dominique Strauss Kahn was forced out in May 2011 , following accusations that he sexually assaulted an employee in a New York hotel . 
Since then , his successor , Christine Lagarde , has helped to restore the Fund &apos;s reputation - and to return coverage of its programs and activities to newspapers &quot; dry and unemotional business sections . 
( When I worked at the IMF in the 2000 &quot; s , page-three coverage of our events by leading newspapers was typically viewed as preferable to top billing . ) 
Of course , in countries receiving assistance - such as Greece in the last few years - the IMF excites great passion . 
But in the halls of the US Congress , few people pay any attention . 
In the highly charged partisan atmosphere of Washington , DC , this is without question almost always an advantage . 
Imagine if the disbursement of all assistance to countries in trouble required Congressional approval , let alone spending from the US budget . 
Nothing good would ever happen - and certainly not for the US . 
The IMF is founded on the premise that it represents cooperation between all of the countries of the world . 
The reality is that it stands for and operationalizes US power , in cooperation with America &apos;s closest allies . 
Anyone who doubts that should review a recent letter orchestrated by the Bretton Woods Committee , addressed to Congressional leaders on behalf of an impressive array of former Republican and Democratic cabinet secretaries . 
The first paragraph reads , &quot; The IMF has always been a valuable tool for advancing US national interests globally . &quot; 
The US does not dictate what happens at the IMF , but it does have a disproportionate influence . 
Given the Fund &apos;s origins in helping to rebuild Europe after World War II , European countries are also very well represented on its executive board and in terms of ownership shares ( and thus voting weight on important decisions ) . 
One major goal in recent decades has been to shift representation at the IMF somewhat away from Europe and toward the world &apos;s emerging markets . 
These countries &quot; global economic and financial significance has grown rapidly , yet they have relatively little representation at the Fund . 
A package of reforms has been agreed . 
Like most products of international negotiations , the agreement is not perfect ; but it does move the ball forward . 
( For the technical details , I recommend a recent paper by Edwin M. Truman , my colleague at the Peterson Institute for International Economics . ) 
These reforms need to be agreed , in legislative form , by the US Congress before they can take effect . 
For whatever reason , President Barack Obama &apos;s administration did not push this item hard in 2013 and early 2014 - and the agenda of encouraging further IMF reform has therefore languished . 
The Obama administration proposed to tie IMF reform to the presumably imminent approval by Congress of funding for Ukraine . 
This is sensible legislative tactics but not appealing as an economic strategy . 
In effect , the administration tried to make the IMF more interesting , particularly to encourage Republicans in the House of Representatives to support the reforms . 
The latest indications are that the Republicans will not be so enticed . 
But the bigger problem is that Ukraine does not really need a massive loan from the IMF . 
What Ukraine needs is a sharp reduction in corruption , as well as real legitimacy ( through the ballot box ) for people who want to rein in the influence of oligarchs - a group that has sapped the economy through plunder and incompetence over the past two decades . 
IMF reform is sensible and should be supported . 
The Europeans do not need their current level of representation , and the positions and voices of middle- and lower-income countries should be strengthened . 
The Obama administration needs to make this case more directly and forcefully to Congress . 
The inherent dullness of the IMF makes that hard .
