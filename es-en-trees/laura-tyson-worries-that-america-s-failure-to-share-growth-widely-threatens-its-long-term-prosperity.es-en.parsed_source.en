Paying for Productivity 
BERKELEY - One of the United States &quot; defining - and disheartening - economic trends over the last 40 years has been real-wage stagnation for most workers . 
According to a recent US Census report , the median full-time male worker earned $ 50,033 in 2013 , barely distinguishable from the comparable ( inflation-adjusted ) figure of $ 49,678 in 1973 . 
Because most households earn the bulk of their income from their labor , the absence of real-wage growth is a major factor behind the stagnation of family incomes . 
The average family income of the bottom 90 % of households has been flat since about 1980 . 
Real family income for the median household in 2013 was 8 % below its 2007 level and nearly 9 % below its 1999 peak . 
Stagnating middle-class wages and family incomes are a major factor behind the US economy &apos;s slow recovery from the 2007-2009 recession , and pose a serious threat to long-term growth and competitiveness . 
Household consumption accounts for more than two-thirds of aggregate demand , and consumption growth depends on income growth for the bottom 90 % . 
The heyday of US economic growth in the two decades after World War II was also a golden era for the middle class . 
The long boom of the 1990s , when the US enjoyed sustained full employment , was one of few periods in the last 40 years when incomes climbed at every quintile of the income distribution . 
Many influential economists are now worried that the US faces anemic growth and &quot; secular stagnation , &quot; owing to a persistent gap between aggregate demand and full employment . 
Stagnant middle-class incomes imply weak aggregate demand , which in turn means slack labor markets and stagnant wages for most workers . 
In the absence of aggressive monetary and fiscal policies to support aggregate demand at full-employment levels , the result is a vicious slow-growth cycle . 
Two competitiveness gurus , Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin of Harvard Business School , recently warned that stagnant middle-class incomes undermine US companies in several ways . 
Unless corporations step up to the plate , &quot; American business will suffer from an inadequate workforce , a population of depleted consumers , and large blocs of anti-business voters . &quot; 
Porter and Rivkin are not calling on businesses simply to pay their workers more . 
That is a laudable goal . 
Nearly half of the respondents indicated that , when possible , they prefer to invest in technology or outsource to third parties and hire part-time workers , none of whom receive much additional training or have a stake in their company &apos;s long-term success . 
There is also a disturbing implication in the Porter-Rivkin survey that workers themselves , along with America &apos;s schools , are to blame for wage stagnation : If only workers were not so poor in math and science , so ill-equipped for the modern world , and so unproductive , they would earn higher incomes . 
The reality is different . 
US productivity has been growing at a respectable pace for two decades . 
The problem is that productivity gains have not translated into commensurate wage increases for the typical worker or income growth for the typical family . 
According to standard economic theory , real wages should track productivity . 
Since then , real wages for the typical worker have flat-lined , while productivity has continued to climb . 
Mishel calculates that productivity increased 80.4 % from 1948 to 2011 , while median real wages rose only 39 % - almost none of the wage growth occurred during the last four decades . 
True , highly skilled workers , especially those with sought-after technology skills and postgraduate degrees , have fared much better . 
But that prosperity has reached only a small elite . 
From 1979 to 2012 , the real median wage increased by only 5 % . 
But real wages climbed 154 % for the top 1 % of wage earners and 39 % for the top 5 % , while real wages stagnated for the bottom 20th percentile of workers and fell for the bottom tenth . 
Indeed , inequality in labor compensation has been the largest driver of yawning income inequality , except at the very top of the income distribution , where capital income has been more important . 
Meanwhile , corporate profits have soared . 
The GDP share of after-tax corporate profits is at a record high , whereas labor compensation has plunged to its lowest share since 1950 . 
Strong productivity growth is an important policy goal . 
Reconnecting productivity gains and wage gains requires both policy actions , such as an increase in the minimum wage with a link to productivity growth , and changes in corporate human-resources practices , such as broader reliance on profit-sharing programs . 
Such programs have intuitive appeal . 
This intuition is confirmed by empirical research . 
Some 20 years ago , Alan Blinder of Princeton University corralled a number of economists , including me , to examine existing studies on the link between profit-sharing and productivity . 
The overwhelming majority of the studies found a strong positive effect . Shared Capitalism at Work , a recent book edited by Douglas Kruse , Richard Freeman , and Joseph Blasi , confirms this conclusion with more recent evidence . 
Various forms of profit-sharing - including grants of options and restricted stock , annual profit-based bonuses , and employee stockownership plans - have been growing as a share of labor compensation since the 1960s . 
But most workers are not covered by such plans , and the biggest beneficiaries have been CEOs and top managers , a significant fraction of whose pay is tied to productivity , as reflected in profits and stock performance . 
Such incentive pay schemes have driven the outsize increases in compensation for the top 1 % of the wage and salary distribution . 
America &apos;s long-run living standards and economic competitiveness depend not just on productivity growth , but also on how that growth is shared . 
More equitable sharing of profits with America &apos;s workers and their families would do much to address the worrisome stagnation of wages and middle-class incomes in recent decades .
