Hypocrisy and War 
MELBOURNE - All the world hates a hypocrite . 
When states preach virtues they do not practice , or set lower hurdles for allies , trading partners , or co-religionists than they do for others , irritation and non-cooperation are the least they can expect . 
International policymaking is a hardheaded , cynical business , but tolerance for double standards has its limits . 
Russia discovered that when it invoked the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; doctrine to try to justify its 2008 invasion of Georgia . 
Democracy promotion by the United States and the European Union generates ridicule when it extends only to elections producing winners found palatable , as Gaza &apos;s vote for Hamas in 2006 did not . 
Nuclear-weapons states keep learning the hard way that strengthening the non-proliferation regime is a tough sell when they drag their feet on disarmament . 
And the invasion of Iraq in 2003 is a gift that keeps on giving to the world &apos;s malcontents : embracing the Security Council only when you get your way , but ignoring or undermining it when you don &apos;t , is no way to promote a cooperative rule-based international order . 
But in the real world , how consistent is it possible to be in responding to genocide and other mass atrocities , treaty breaches , border violations , or other serious trespasses against international law ? 
To demand that every case that seems to look alike be treated alike might set the bar impossibly high , and certainly runs the risk of becoming hostage to critics - like those who attack the intervention in Libya - who assert that if you can &apos;t act everywhere , you shouldn &apos;t act anywhere . 
The hardest cases , always generating the strongest emotions , involve the coercive use of military force . 
Why strike in Libya but not in Darfur - or in Yemen , Bahrain , or Syria ? 
If military intervention in Libya and CÃ´te d &apos;Ivoire were correct decisions , why wasn &apos;t the Iraq invasion in 2003 , given Saddam &apos;s many crimes ? 
What credence can the responsibility to protect have when we know that however bad things get in Tibet , Xinjiang , or the Northern Caucasus , military action against China or Russia will always be off limits ? 
But nuance is exactly what is required . 
These guidelines have not yet been formally adopted by the General Assembly or the Security Council , and remain only background noise in current international debates . 
The first test is seriousness of risk : Is the threatened harm of such a kind and scale as tojustify prima facie the use of force ? 
The risk of an imminent civilian bloodbath was as real in Benghazi and Abidjan last month as it was in Rwanda in 1994 . 
By contrast , there was no such imminent risk in Iraq in 2003 , though there certainly had been a decade and more earlier for the country &apos;s northern Kurds and southern Shiites . 
The current situations in Bahrain , Yemen , and Syria are on the cusp : ugly , but smaller in scale and perhaps retrievable by pressure short of military action ( of which the US and its allies could usefully apply much more ) . 
The second test is whether the primary purpose of the proposed military action is to halt or avert the threat in question . 
Libya passes , as would most other recent cases : had oil - or regime change - been the primary motivation , the Arab League and the Security Council would never have endorsed military intervention . 
Russia , by contrast , found it hard to find any takers for its assertion that civilian protection was the primary rationale for its South Ossetian adventure in 2008 . 
The third test whether every non-military option has been explored and found wanting . 
Libya again followed the textbook : Resolution 1970 applied targeted sanctions , an arms embargo , and the threat of prosecution at the International Criminal Court to concentrate Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s mind on civilian protection . 
Only when that failed did Resolution 1973 embrace the military option . 
In Iraq in 2003 , lesser options had far from run their course , which is arguably true now in Bahrain , Yemen , and Syria . 
The fourth test is one of proportionality : Are the scale , duration , and intensity of the proposed military action the minimum necessary to meet the threat ? 
As military stalemate looms in Libya , there will be a growing temptation to stretch the UN &apos;s legal authority - and the moral and political support that goes with it - to the breaking point , and NATO is now close to that line . 
It must not cross it if it wants to preserve its own credibility , and the world &apos;s capacity for intervention in similar conscience-shocking cases . 
The final , and usually toughest , legitimacy test attempts to balance the consequences : Will those at risk be better or worse off ? 
This was always the showstopper in Darfur : any attempted invasion of Sudan would have been disastrous for the two million displaced people , and would have re-ignited the country &apos;s even deadlier north-south conflict . 
This test explains the effective impunity of China , Russia , or any other major power ; however badly it behaves internally , any attempted invasion would trigger a much larger conflagration . 
Resolving Libya &apos;s agony will take more than military action . 
But , when examined against the right criteria , cases that initially look alike are often very different . 
Even when they &apos;re not , a higher principle surely comes into play . 
When our common humanity is under threat , even if we can &apos;t do everything we should , shouldn &apos;t we at least do what we can ?
