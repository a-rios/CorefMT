Vaclav Havel : The Dissident in Power \ n 
The life of Vaclav Havel , who is stepping down as president of the Czech Republic , could serve as inspiration for one of Havel &apos;s own absurdist plays . 
Born in 1936 into one of the wealthiest Czech families , Havel was one of the people persecuted because of their &quot; wrong class origins &quot; after the Communist takeover of 1948 . 
Havel defied his misfortune by establishing himself during the 1960s as one of Europe &apos;s leading playwrights , only to become a pariah again after the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia crushed the &quot; Prague Spring &quot; reform movement in 1968 . 
But he returned to lead his country &apos;s tiny dissident community . 
Famous around the world for both his writings and his struggle against communism , he endured ceaseless harassment , including imprisonment for five years at the beginning of the 1980s . 
In fact , he was just released from another term in prison when the &quot; Velvet Revolution &quot; of November 1989 catapulted him into the presidency . 
It is impossible to separate Havel the playwright from Havel the dissident or Havel the political leader . 
His earliest plays were political , ridiculing the wooden locutions of communist rhetoric . 
Even during the liberal Prague Spring , Havel remained a dissenter , never accepting the idea of &quot; socialism with a human face , &quot; arguing instead that real democracy was the only alternative to communism . 
Later , as a dissident , Havel continued writing and became a politician of sorts as the unofficial leader of the anti-communist opposition . 
Later still , he became the leader of that opposition at its moment of triumph . 
A dissident as president is bound to be unorthodox . 
Havel continued writing , changing his genre from plays and essays to speeches , most of which are , in fact , philosophical writings . 
Indeed , he regularly put forth ideas- on the dangers of globalization , on the need for global responsibility , on his vision of Europe as a federation of states and regions- before other political leaders dared to do so . 
At home , he exasperated party politicians by preaching the need for morality in politics or by warning against excessive partisanship . 
He repeatedly spoke of building a robust civil society , arguing that political parties will degenerate into sects if they are closed to influence from below . 
Although Havel refuses to describe himself in terms of left and right , he is more a communitarian than a classical liberal , and certainly more leftist than rightist . 
He emphasized that a democratic system cannot be based only on institutions and mechanisms , such as the checks and balances between the executive , the legislature , and the judiciary ; democracy needs more than political parties and free elections . 
For Havel , democracy without true democrats is impossible . 
Only a civil society , in which active citizens are freely engaged in public life and show altruism and solidarity with others , can keep democracy vital . 
To quote Havel &apos;s close friend , the Catholic priest and philosopher Tomas Halik ( whom Havel once proposed as his successor ) , democracy without civil society is like a body without blood circulation . 
Perhaps a person as original and unorthodox as Havel only becomes a political leader in revolutionary times . 
Revolutions demand moral clarity and unshakeable conviction . 
But elevation to the heights of power in this way has its costs . 
Because Havel did not go through the usual party schools of political training , he often felt that he need not respect the rules of the political game , and he often showed contempt for the compromises and moral short cuts practiced by politicians . 
While he was seen abroad through the prism of his heroism and his philosophical speeches , at home Havel was often perceived as being deeply engaged in the political scrum . 
His critics argue that he developed a taste for intrigue and used behind-the-scenes maneuvering to achieve his aims . 
Others accused him of pursuing &quot; non-political politics &quot; - a concept of democracy whose protagonists wish to do away with political parties entirely and replace them with the more nebulous and perhaps more easily manipulated &quot; civil society . &quot; 
But Havel was drawn into everyday politics because the Czech constitution gave him no choice . 
He had to appoint officials , select prime ministers after parliamentary elections , award state decorations , and make speeches . 
True , he provoked party bosses by his often unorthodox approach . 
But given the partisanship and intense provincialism of the Czech Republic , any president who bucks the system and is as cosmopolitan as Havel would face difficulties . 
Perhaps Havel &apos;s biggest failure was that he did not grasp as quickly as others , including his main political rival , Vaclav Klaus , that Czechoslovakia as a federal state of two nations was doomed after 1989 . 
The Slovaks , who had not experienced their own state and felt patronized by the Czechs , gradually eroded the common state . 
Klaus , who thought that the economically less successful Slovakia was holding the Czechs back , did not object . 
Havel , however , believed until the last moment that the common state could be saved . 
As a result , many Slovaks saw him as condescending toward them , of failing to understand their national aspirations . 
In July 1992 , Slovak lawmakers blocked his reelection as Czechoslovak president . 
But Havel &apos;s domestic failures were more than offset by his foreign policy contributions : persuading America and Western Europe to enlarge NATO -an organization which , prior to 1989 , he thought should be abolished , and advocating Czech membership in the European Union . 
Above all , Havel used his international prestige to give the Czech Republic a positive image , one which the country- plagued by many post-communist ills- perhaps did not fully deserve . 
Partly owing to Havel , the Czech Republic is now a standard democratic country whose fate does not depend on one politician . 
But without Havel , the Czechs may well find that they no longer receive the same warm reception in the international arena .
