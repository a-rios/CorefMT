Exorcising Musharraf \ u0027s Ghost 
CAMBRIDGE - Following its recent free elections , Pakistan is rebounding politically . 
But the euphoria that came with the end of the Musharraf era is wearing off , as the new government faces stark choices . 
Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan , democracy is not new to this 60-year-old state , but ethnic cleavages , weak institutions , and religious extremism in the North are perennially destabilizing . 
And , while the new government settles in and establishes its priorities , the West , especially the United States , must reassess the impact of its past dealings with Pakistan . 
Pakistan &apos;s new prime minister , Yousaf Gilani , is a seasoned politician and , more importantly , has Sufi family roots , which is a good omen because of the Sufi tradition of tolerance . 
Gilani unequivocally declared in his inaugural address that fighting terrorism is a top priority , and his first decision was to release from house arrest judges deposed by Musharraf . 
The respite from the horrendous spate of suicide bombings since the new government assumed power is similarly heartening . 
But the honeymoon period is coming to an end . 
Already , in Gilani &apos;s hometown of Multan , rioters attacked government offices and banks to protest electricity disruptions . 
A couple of well-known opposition politicians , a chief minister and a federal cabinet minister of the previous pro-Musharraf government , were publicly thrashed , raising doubts about government control over law and order in the country . 
So far , Musharraf has accepted his diminishing stature quietly - though he has few other options . 
The new political leadership , both inside and outside the parliament , has been carefully avoiding a head-on collision with the president . 
Interestingly , in the midst of the political transition , Musharraf embarked on a week-long visit to China to lobby for construction of an oil and gas pipeline between China and the Persian Gulf that would be routed through Pakistan . 
The deeper question raised by this proposal is whether Musharraf meant to convey a message to the US that Pakistan &apos;s priorities were shifting . 
The revival of democratic politics in Pakistan will undoubtedly effect Pakistan-US relations . 
Pakistan &apos;s military links with America appear to remain on a sound footing , so the strategic alliance with the US is likely to continue , perhaps with some nuanced differences over how to fight the &quot; war on terror . &quot; 
But Pakistani politicians are bound to be influenced by domestic public opinion , which is generally critical of US policies . 
Nevertheless , long-term US interests in the region will be better served if Pakistan &apos;s democratic forces successfully establish themselves . 
A proposal in the US Senate to increase development and education aid to Pakistan could help in winning the hearts and minds . 
Meanwhile , President George W. Bush has said that &quot; if another September 11-style attack is being planned , it probably is being plotted in Pakistan and not Afghanistan . &quot; 
Whether this American intelligence assessment is based on credible information is unknown . 
American election-year politics may also be behind this assertion . 
Pakistan must take this view seriously , regardless of Bush &apos;s motivations . 
The new government should quickly devise a policy to deal with terrorism . 
Recent months have seen dozens of suicide bombings and other terrorist activities - the price of Pakistan &apos;s own past blunders , as well as those of the West . 
Afghanistan is a prime example , as is the failure to settle the Kashmir imbroglio with India . 
Both failures have strengthened domestic terrorist groups . 
Pakistan &apos;s government appears to be preparing to talk to some of the extremists in the tribal areas , introduce political reforms , and redouble development efforts . 
But reference to &quot; talks &quot; makes the West uncomfortable . 
American officials have likened this strategy to negotiating with terrorists , and point to a previous round of negotiations that did nothing to stop violence in the tribal areas . 
But the new leadership wants to distinguish between al-Qaeda terrorists and religious conservatives and disillusioned Pashtun youth within Pakistan . 
After all , the victory of the secular Awami National Party ( ANP ) in Pakistan &apos;s North-West Frontier Province is a strong indication that people there have rejected religious political forces and violence . 
This window of opportunity can be expanded through dialogue and reconciliation with those who are ready to disavow extremism and militancy . 
The new Pakistani government needs to explain this to the West in order to keep its support . 
The US , meanwhile , should end direct military strikes in the area , even if these are conducted with the knowledge and cooperation of Pakistan &apos;s military . 
Force has never worked with the Pashtun tribes , and there is no evidence that this has changed . 
There are real signs that the new government is considered a credible partner in the tribal areas . 
It needs to be given time to find a way out of the endless cycle of violence .
