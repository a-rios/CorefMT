Iraqi Libya 
GENEVA - As post-revolution Libya looks ahead , Iraq looms as a perilous example . 
After 42 years of dictatorship , Libya , like Iraq in 2003 after the fall of Saddam Hussein , needs more than wishful thinking to become a vibrant democracy . 
It needs organized state-building in Tripoli - and realistic policymaking in Western capitals . 
Successful transitions depend from the start on factors that are still crucially missing in Libya - a relatively cohesive leadership , an active civil society , and national unity . 
Without these , Libya will most likely fail to find its footing and , much like post-Saddam Iraq , suffer from persistent political division and volatile civil disorder , in addition to a multifaceted array of geopolitical pressures . 
Avoiding that outcome presupposes a strong political center . 
It lacks the sort of civil society that could have led the uprising and planted the seeds for post-authoritarian politics , as was the case in Tunisia and ( more problematically ) Egypt . 
Libya &apos;s transition was arguably further impeded by NATO &apos;s intervention , as the rapid shift from a spontaneous popular uprising to an elite-led and externally supported movement prevented the revolution from following the linear course seen in Tunisia and Egypt . 
Thus , despite substantial international support , the Libyan National Transitional Council ( NTC ) still lacks the level of consensus needed to form a viable government . 
The NTC has suffered regular internal disputes , and its membership and functioning are shrouded in secrecy . 
Last July , the Council &apos;s military leader , Abdul Fatah Younis al-Obeidi , was assassinated under ambiguous circumstances . 
Then , in November , the NTC &apos;s military prosecutor named its own former deputy prime minister , Ali al-Issawi , as the prime suspect . 
The conflict and opacity surrounding the case are telling signs of the country &apos;s political fragility since Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s demise . 
Libya should take note of how Iraq &apos;s post-Saddam transition has featured ceaseless power struggles and infighting . 
In 2010 , Iraqi political leaders &quot; machinations - personal , as well as tribal and sectarian - left the country without a government for 249 days . 
Today , Libya appears set to undergo similar struggles , owing mostly to the presence of powerful political actors outside the NTC . 
The 20,000-strong Tripoli Military Council , for example , which controls the capital , has been consistently independent of the NTC , and forced out its first foreign minister , Mahmoud Jibril . 
The rival Tripoli &apos;s Revolutionists Council , meanwhile , has warned that it would unseat any incoming government should its demands for representation not be met . 
The NTC also faces pressure from Libya &apos;s Berbers , who comprise 10 % of the population and have already taken to the streets to denounce the new political arrangements and to reject any system that does not accommodate theirculture andlanguage . 
This dissension may well be compounded by two additional factors . 
The first is major cities &quot; competing sense of entitlement to the fruits of the revolution : Misurata , where Qaddafi &apos;s body was displayed ; 
Tripoli , which hosted the liberation ceremony ; and Zintan , which is holding Qaddafi &apos;s son , Saif al-Islam el-Qaddafi , prisoner . 
And all of them , like most Libyans , share the unrealistic expectation that their newfound freedom will somehow solve their socio-economic woes . 
The second complicating factor is that political power now lies in the hands of competing militias . 
The internecine rivalries that began in earnest last November between fighters from Zawiya and Warshefana , and among Tripoli &apos;s various factions , will be difficult to defuse , as the thowar ( revolutionaries ) have refused repeated calls by the NTC to disarm . 
Tripoli is in danger of becoming like Baghdad circa 2005 , with different groups controlling turf and instituting a clientelist neighborhood political economy . 
Inter-urban competition and the militias &quot; defiant independence are all the more worrisome because Libya is awash in weapons , with unguarded caches , abandoned stockpiles , looted ammunition depots , and thousands of shoulder-fired heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles . 
Last November , Mokhtar Belmokhtar , the commander of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) , confirmed that AQIM seized the opportunity to secure some of this arsenal when the revolution started . 
Meanwhile , the aims of France , the United Kingdom , the United States , the Arab League , NATO , and Qatar , all of which have played a role in Libya &apos;s transformation , are unlikely to be the same . 
In other words , external pressures , too , are likely to pull Libya in several different directions , which will only further delay an autonomous and sustainable state-building process . 
Qaddafi left behind a booby-trap . 
The collapse of authoritarian rule created a security vacuum with no functioning state apparatus , making Libya highly exposed to international influence , often in the service of corporate interests . 
To avoid repetition of the costly mistakes made in Iraq , Libya will require adroit leadership that can elaborate a compelling new national vision with which to unify competing authorities , rein in undisciplined militias , and minimize the country &apos;s strategic vulnerability .
