A Europe of Provinces , Not States 
As the European Constitutional Convention assembles to debate the fine points of the European Union &apos;s future institutions , now is the moment to think the unthinkable about where Europe is heading . 
Or at least , to consider perhaps a quite different question : where would it be reasonable for the EU to move ? 
Communism &apos;s fall saw the appearance of several small states in Europe . 
Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania reemerged from Soviet occupation . 
Czechoslovakia split into two separate states . 
Yugoslavia gave way to Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia , Serbia , Macedonia ; it may perhaps shortly disgorge Kosovo and Montenegro as well . 
Although the Baltic republics merely reestablished their pre-WWII independence , and Yugoslavia &apos;s breakup was a bloody affair like so many other wars of independence , there is something tantalizing new in all this as well . 
In the interwar years , the Baltic states were often viewed as impractical , artificial creations of the Great Powers . 
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia came into existence because their constituent parts were not seen as viable independent states . 
Why was this ? 
Because 80 years ago , when Wilson , Clemenceau , and Lloyd George redrew the map of Europe , small states were dysfunctional in times of both war and peace . 
To be viable , a state needed to be large enough to defend itself and to constitute a relatively self-contained economic market . 
None of this holds true today . 
With the prospect of entry into the EU , national markets matter less . 
Both EU and NATO membership make war among European member states unthinkable , and an attack on even the smallest NATO member would bring a response from all NATO members . 
Lacking such external threats , the ties between , say , Czechs and Slovaks ( to say nothing of Serbs and Croats ! ) are too weak to warrant a common national level of government . 
Does this tell us something about the future of Europe as a whole ? 
The difference between Czechoslovakia and Italy or Germany is mostly one of 50 years . 
After all , wasn &apos;t Italy , until 1860s , a collection of kingdoms and principalities ? 
Wasn &apos;t Germany &apos;s unification a matter of &quot; blood and iron &quot; ? 
France and Spain are older , but is the marriage of Basques , Catalans , and Corsicans with their national states that much happier than the former Czech / Slovak marriage ? 
Is there really that much reason why the Scots and Welsh should be part of the same national state as the English ? 
Why do Piemontese , Bavarians , or Scots need intermediate national bureaucracies to run their tax policies , welfare programs , securities laws , and the largely useless , duplicative armies ? 
Wouldn &apos;t life be easier if a common market , currency , foreign policy , army , and a few other things were run on a Europe-wide basis , with the rest left to more meaningful local units ? 
It is fashionable to mock the bureaucratic minutia of European regulation . 
But European regulation is as nothing compared to the mountains of national laws and decrees , billions wasted in political patronage , and the colossal state machines that eat up 30-40 % of the economic product of Europe &apos;s nation states . 
Could any common European state do worse ? 
Indeed , the creation of a European federal government and the elimination of national intermediaries would probably lead to the greatest liberalization of the economy ( and society as a whole ) in Europe &apos;s entire history . 
Look at America in 1787 : creation of the federal government swept away the balkanized system of pre-revolutionary colonies , ushering in an era of entrepreneurial expansion across the entire American Continent . 
The simple fact is that Europe as a whole is too diverse to be captured by the economic and political interest groups that now dominate national states . 
It is only as an 
Nations also put Europe &apos;s constitutional balance out of kilter . 
Germany and Italy are simply too big , as compared to Portugal or Belgium ( itself a rather questionable amalgam of the Flemish and the Walloons ) , and this creates the types of imbalances reminiscent of the heavy foot of Prussia in the old Bismarckian empire . 
Could a federal Europe replace today &apos;s national identities ? 
Could the French and the British feel as spiritually at home in &quot; Europe &quot; as they feel in their national states ? 
No , but must they ? 
When Europeans think of future institutions , the tension is always seen as that between national differences and the common European identity . 
But what if common European institutions are not viewed through the prism of national institutions ? 
What if the evolution of European consciousness proceeds not by an upward transfer of attachment to supranational institutions , but by a 
Of course , the demise of national states is not imminent , but not because they are so deeply rooted in the consciousness of their citizens . 
Indeed , national identities are mostly impoverishing abstractions , clich√©s , like race , class , and other ideological creations . 
Think of how much more genuine diversity would there be in a united Europe if national states did not squat in the middle . 
But Europe &apos;s nation states are not going to disappear for a while because they are
