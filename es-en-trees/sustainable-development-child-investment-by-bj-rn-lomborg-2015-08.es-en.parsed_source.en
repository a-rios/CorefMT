Next-Generation Development 
PRAGUE - Over the next 15 years , some two billion children will be born , 90 % in the poorest parts of the world . 
Providing these kids with a better start would be one of the greatest achievements that humanity could make . 
Doing so also would be one of the most efficient uses of the resources that the world dedicates to development . 
Next month , world leaders will gather at the United Nations in New York to agree on the Sustainable Development Goals : the targets that will succeed the 18 set in the year 2000 by the Millennium Development Goals . 
The list of potential targets is impossibly long : 169 in all , toward which trillions of dollars will be spent . 
How they are prioritized will be profoundly important to the lives of billions of people . 
The Copenhagen Consensus , a research organization that I head , asked 82 eminent economists from around the world to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed targets , in order to establish which are likely to do the most good for people , the planet , and global prosperity over the next 15 years . 
It turns out that one of the best ways to help is by focusing on improving the lives of children . 
Our analysis identified 19 targets that would do the most good for every dollar spent . 
In fact , each dollar spent on these 19 targets would do four times as much good as spending the same money on all 169 . 
It is not surprising that the top 19 include interventions improving the fortunes of the young ; after all , they will grow up to become the workers and leaders of tomorrow . 
Opportunities start at birth - or not . 
Although the child mortality rate has been reduced by two-thirds since 1970 , a horrifying number of children still die in their first years of life . 
In 2013 , 6.3 million children died before their fifth birthday . 
Nearly one-third were newborn babies who lost their lives because they were born prematurely or because of complications during birth . 
We know from experience that it is perfectly feasible to target a 70 % reduction in child mortality , but that doing so will be expensive , requiring the construction of effective health services to deliver high-quality care before , during , and after birth . 
And yet our research shows that it would be money well spent . 
Among the additional positive effects would be more capable health services , providing better care to people of all ages . 
Keeping kids healthy and well fed are two other highly cost-effective targets . 
Since 1970 , the international community has managed to vaccinate most of the world &apos;s children against measles , tetanus , whooping cough , diphtheria , and polio . 
These interventions likely save three million lives a year - a phenomenal achievement . 
There is an opportunity to do much more . 
In economic terms , each dollar spent would deliver $ 60 worth of welfare for the world &apos;s youngest people . 
Tackling malnutrition would be another effective use of development dollars . 
Kids who do not get enough to eat during their vital early years do not develop properly and remain disadvantaged throughout their lives . 
Even those who get enough overall calories can suffer ill effects , if they are deprived of essential vitamins , minerals , and protein . 
A target to lower chronic malnutrition by 40 % , by ensuring better access to micronutrients and sufficient food , would have a remarkable impact . 
Every dollar spent on better nutrition for the young produces $ 45 of social benefits . 
Improving the quality of education is another worthy goal , as even the healthiest , best-fed children will struggle to learn when their schools are substandard . 
To be sure , improving the quality of education is not easy ; even rich countries struggle to do so . 
The best education target would be to triple the number of children attending pre-school in sub-Saharan Africa , the world &apos;s most deprived region . 
Not only would this be relatively cheap ; it would also provide children with a life-long yearning for learning , boosting their life chances and delivering benefits worth $ 33 for every dollar invested . 
It is morally right that every child should be given the best chance to survive , eat well , stay healthy , and receive an education . 
Healthy , well-educated kids grow into productive adults , capable of providing a better future for their own children , creating a virtuous circle that can help build a better , more prosperous world .
