Beyond Inflation Targets 
EDINBURGH - Over the last three decades or so , central bankers and academics have become increasingly confident that inflation targeting is the key to preserving macroeconomic stability . 
But this is virtually impossible to prove , and the 2008 financial crisis suggested to many that monetary policy should focus on more than the prices of goods and services . 
So how should a revised mandate for central banks be structured to maintain their focus on low inflation while allowing monetary policy to address other issues when appropriate ? 
The contribution that inflation targeting makes to macroeconomic stability is difficult to discern for a simple reason : it is impossible to know what would happen if a country &apos;s central bank pursued the opposite course . 
Unable to compare outcomes directly , researchers have employed a variety of strategies to identify the impact of inflation targeting , and have typically found it to be substantial ( though the effect becomes small or even zero when countries &quot; starting points are taken into account ) . 
For example , a case study of the United Kingdom for 1997-2007 - a period of full inflation targets and policy independence for the Bank of England ( BoE ) - indicates considerable improvement from a poor starting point . 
The focus on price stability was accompanied by relatively low inflation ( compared to the past , as well as to other major economies ) , strong growth , and little output volatility . 
However , over this period the UK also experienced sustained exchange-rate misalignment , which the BoE &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee was unwilling or unable to address within its existing mandate . 
The MPC also failed to respond to any of the three bouts of rapid growth in house prices that preceded the financial crisis , arguing that they were structural in nature -caused by the decline in inflation and interest rates since the 1980 &quot; s - so a monetary response was not appropriate . 
In the run-up to the crisis , the US Federal Reserve Board ( an informal inflation targeter ) was even more committed than the MPC to this orthodox view - so committed , in fact , that it barely allocated any time or resources to analyzing house-price fluctuations . 
So , while inflation-targeting central banks worked hard to nail down inflation expectations in goods and services , they made no effort to influence asset-price expectations . 
Indeed , the &quot; Greenspan put &quot; ( former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan &apos;s monetary-policy approach ) eliminated the downside risk by setting a floor under asset prices ; but it set no ceiling on the upside . 
If major banks had had a &quot; lean against the wind &quot; strategy in reserve , that would have influenced expectations and at least partly stabilized asset prices , possibly mitigating - or even averting - the most damaging effects of the financial crisis . 
The notion of integrating asset-price concerns into inflation targeting remains a source of significant controversy , with opponents citing the Tinbergen Principle : if policymakers have one instrument , the interest rate , they can pursue only one objective , price stability . 
Attempts to pursue multiple objectives , the logic goes , would confuse financial markets and private-sector agents . 
But central banks have pursued multiple objectives simultaneously , without bringing about bad outcomes or destroying their own credibility . 
Likewise , since 2008 , many central banks - under pressure from governments - have been reacting specifically to other developments in the real economy ( particularly unemployment ) , rather than maintaining their single-minded focus on long-term price stability . 
This is particularly obvious in the UK , where the government , desperate to see an economic recovery before the 2015 elections , has been pushing the BoE to introduce credit subsidies and , more recently , forward guidance . 
As a result , the BoE &apos;s decisions have been attuned to the short-run trade-off between growth and inflation - meaning that it has been making decisions about goals , not just instruments . 
What central banks need now is a revised mandate that upholds price stability as the primary , long-term objective , while allowing policymakers to pursue other objectives when appropriate . 
Specifically , the central bank should be able to move slowly on price stability if it regards the real economy as unacceptably weak , or if an asset-price misalignment threatens financial stability and cannot be defused quickly by the new macro-prudential instruments . 
Under the current arrangements for the BoE , if inflation moves more than one percentage point away from its target ( in either direction ) , the bank &apos;s governor is obliged to write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining the deviation and providing a plan to eliminate it , including a projected timeline . 
A revised remit for the BoE - or , in some form , for other inflation-targeting central banks - could take this requirement further , specifying a primary and long-term target for inflation from which policymakers can deviate if doing so is deemed necessary . 
In such cases , the central bank &apos;s governor should be required to write an open letter explaining the bank &apos;s decision , including how long it expects to give priority to the non-inflation objective and how it foresees returning to normal operations . 
Such an arrangement would allow the central bank to take a wider view of its responsibilities in a context of transparency and accountability , but in a way that both preserves its anti-inflationary credibility and prevents politically motivated or otherwise inappropriate policy decisions .
