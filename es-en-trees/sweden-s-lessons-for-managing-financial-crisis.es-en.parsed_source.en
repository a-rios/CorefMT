Sweden &apos;s Lessons for Managing Financial Crisis 
STOCKHOLM - Although Sweden is a small country , its experiences managing its financial crisis of the early 1990 &quot; s may provide valuable lessons for others . 
The Swedish crisis began in 1991 with the first major insolvency in the financial market . 
A number of damaging developments followed : 
Most of the banking system fell into deep crisis . 
One bank went into liquidation , while the rest of the system required extensive governmental emergency aid.Property values fell by approximately 35 % over four years . 
Equities fell by 55 % over a three-year period.Despite the central bank &apos;s 500 % interest rate , it was impossible to defend the Swedish krona , which was pegged to the euro &apos;s forerunner , the European Currency Unit or Ecu . 
The krona depreciated by around 25 % in the autumn of 1992 , a year after the crisis began.The crisis triggered a sharp economic downturn . 
GDP fell by 7 % over three years , and unemployment rose by 7 % over five years.During a three-year period , government debt increased by about 50 % , with the public deficit reaching 12 % of GDP . 
Falling GDP led to declining tax revenues , while rising unemployment led to an automatic increase in public expenditure.Although the crisis that began in the United States in 2007 has since spread worldwide , the outlook for the US economy is clearly crucial to eventual global recovery . 
If we assume that the US is experiencing a typical financial crisis , GDP will fall this year as well . 
Unemployment can be expected to peak around 12 % , and gross public debt will have increased by 50 % , which corresponds to around 90 % of GDP . 
But if the US follows the Swedish pattern , the worst of the financial sector &apos;s problems are now in the past . 
In terms of fiscal problems and real economic decline , however , the US would still have most of the crisis ahead of it . 
In Sweden , the decline in GDP lasted for three years , and the economy was then lifted by a dramatic increase in exports , owing to the sharp depreciation of the krona , with annual industrial output rising by around 10 % on average over two years . 
The US is not likely to repeat this experience . 
Financial crises and currency crises are often linked , but we have not seen this in the US . 
Instead , paradoxically , the dollar has at least until recently been bolstered somewhat by the crisis . 
Although the US is the epicenter of the crisis , its government debt instruments continue to be regarded as the safest investments in the world . 
Will America &apos;s widening fiscal deficit alter this perception ? 
One can imagine two scenarios for the dollar over the next five years . 
In the first , the dollar retains its position or perhaps even rises slightly . 
In the second , the decline in the US economy and growing fiscal problems lead to a sharp fall in the dollar . 
Some estimates show that it would take a 40 % depreciation of the dollar to bring US foreign payments into balance . 
Neither scenario is good for Europe - or for the rest of the world . 
In recent decades , the fast-growing Asian economies , as well as European Union economies such as Germany and the Nordic countries , have made export-led growth their primary economic strategy . 
As a result , growth in those countries is dependent on US demand , and their industrial sectors have become too large to be compatible with long-term balance . 
So both these scenarios seem to preclude export-led growth as a successful strategy . 
In any case , rich European countries will suffer a permanent structural decline in manufacturing : much of the decline that we now see in European manufacturing is not the result of temporary economic movements but is part of a long-term adjustment of the industrial sector &apos;s size . 
Although the bigger EU countries have embarked on a policy to protect their industries as long as the crisis continues , they will doubtless be unsuccessful , because no country can ultimately halt structural adjustment by offering subsidies . 
Moreover , protectionist measures will increase fiscal problems , and this will ultimately deepen the international downturn and delay recovery . 
But it is too easy to say what should not be done . 
In the absence of any &quot; miracle &quot; cure , the medium-term aim should be to renew and strengthen the framework for international economic and trade cooperation . 
A significant cause of the current crisis was the imbalances in international trade and capital flows that built up over many years , without anybody taking responsibility for the consequences . 
Remedial action in Europe should include completing the internal market . 
Only when Europe has a dynamic internal market can balanced European growth occur . 
And achieving that goal is more important than ever , because it will be some time before the US can re-assume the role of locomotive for the world economy .
