Are the Barbarians at the EU Gates ? 
BRUSSELS - The euro area confronts a fundamental crisis that attacks on financial speculators will do nothing to resolve . 
The European Council of Ministers had to promise hundreds of billions of euros to its financially imperiled member countries , even though the European economy as a whole is not really in crisis . 
Nevertheless , the crisis poses an almost existential challenge to the European Union - and has required such huge sums - because it directly implicates the key underlying principle of European governance : the nature of the state . 
The case of Greece has raised the simple but profound question : can a member state of the EU be allowed to fail ? 
One view is that the state is sacrosanct : the EU has to intervene and help any errant member to get back on its feet . 
Problems could arise only because of unanticipated shocks , temporary local political difficulties , and - the favorite culprit - irrational markets . 
Applied to Greece , this view implies that the country &apos;s fiscal crisis resulted from an overreaction by world financial markets to local political difficulties ( excessive spending by the Greek government before last year &apos;s elections ) . 
Moreover , it implies that the crisis is fully under European control , and that the European authorities have elaborated a comprehensive plan that will resolve all of Greece &apos;s fiscal and structural problems . 
Hence the official - let &apos;s say &quot; Southern &quot; - refrain : &quot; The IMF / EU plan will succeed . 
Failure is not an option . &quot; 
The alternative view is more pragmatic and rules-based . 
This &quot; Northern &quot; view starts from the premise that member states remain sovereign units , and that it is possible that a member country does not implement a necessary economic-adjustment program . 
This view is embodied in the &quot; no bailout &quot; clause in the euro &apos;s founding document , which stipulates that each country is responsible for its own public debt . 
Failure then becomes an option if the country concerned violates the single currency &apos;s basic rules . 
Financial markets do not participate directly in this debate . 
But they have much skin in this game . 
The collective judgment of financial markets on any government &apos;s economic and fiscal policy is expressed in the risk premium that the government must pay on its external debt . 
Doubts in financial markets lead to higher risk premia , which make it even more difficult to finance a government that is already facing financial problems . 
Financial markets are often wrong in their judgments . 
One might object that the distinction between Southern and Northern views is academic nowadays , because failure really isn &apos;t an option , given that it would trigger a disastrous reaction in global financial markets . 
The key choice for this group is simple : should they direct their efforts solely at preventing failure ( including open-ended fiscal support ) , or should they also prepare for the failure of a member state in order to mitigate the consequences if that should happen ? 
The first choice is bound to imply elaborate measures designed to deliver &quot; more of the same &quot; - a strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact , for example , with more provisions for economic policy surveillance and cooperation . 
So long as EU leaders cannot answer that question , financial markets will continue to harbor doubts about the euro &apos;s long-term stability . 
The eurozone cannot stabilize in political and economic terms without a solid framework for crisis resolution and an ability to deal with sovereign default by a member state . 
The view that member states cannot be allowed to fail logically implies that a political or at least a fiscal union must underpin the euro . 
This is the choice that European leaders now confront : a radical step forward toward political or policy integration , or a clear framework to deal with the consequences of a member country &apos;s failure to abide by the fundamental rules of the monetary union . 
No amount of money will allow European leaders to fudge this issue .
