The Deflation Bogeyman 
CAMBRIDGE - The world &apos;s major central banks are currently obsessed with the goal of raising their national inflation rates to their common target of about 2 % per year . 
This is true for the United States , where the annual inflation rate was -0.1 % over the past 12 months ; for the United Kingdom , where the most recent data show 0.3 % price growth ; and for the eurozone , where consumer prices fell 0.6 % . 
But is this a real problem ? 
The sharp decline in energy prices is the primary reason for the recent drop in the inflation rate . 
In the US , the core inflation rate ( which strips out changes in volatile energy and food prices ) was 1.6 % over the last 12 months . 
Moreover , the US Federal Reserve , the Bank of England , and the European Central Bank understand that even if energy prices do not rise in the coming year , a stable price level for oil and other forms of energy will cause the inflation rate to rise . 
In the US , the inflation rate has also been depressed by the rise in the value of the dollar relative to the euro and other currencies , which has caused import prices to decline . 
This , too , is a &quot; level effect , &quot; implying that the inflation rate will rise once the dollar &apos;s exchange rate stops appreciating . 
But , despite this understanding , the major central banks continue to maintain extremely low interest rates as a way to increase demand and , with it , the rate of inflation . 
They are doing this by promising to keep short-term rates low ; maintaining large portfolios of private and government bonds ; and , in Europe and Japan , continuing to engage in large-scale asset purchases . 
The central bankers justify their concern about low inflation by arguing that a negative demand shock could shift their economies into a period of prolonged deflation , in which the overall price level declines year after year . 
That would have two adverse effects on aggregate demand and employment . 
First , the falling price level would raise the real value of the debts that households and firms owe , making them poorer and reducing their willingness to spend . 
Second , negative inflation means that real interest rates rise , because central banks cannot lower the nominal interest rate below zero . 
Higher real interest rates , in turn , depress business investment and residential construction . 
In theory , by depressing aggregate demand , the combination of increased real debt and higher real interest rates could lead to further price declines , leading to even larger negative inflation rates . 
As a result , the real interest rate would rise further , pushing the economy deeper into a downward spiral of falling prices and declining demand . 
Fortunately , we have relatively little experience with deflation to test the downward-spiral theory . 
The most widely cited example of a deflationary economy is Japan . 
Japan &apos;s inflation rate fell from nearly 8 % in 1980 to zero in 1987 . 
It then stayed above zero until 1995 , after which it remained low but above zero until 1999 , and then varied between zero and -1.7 % until 2012 . 
Moreover , low inflation and periods of deflation did not prevent real incomes from rising in Japan . 
From 1999 to 2013 , real per capita GDP rose at an annual rate of about 1 % ( which reflected a more modest rise of real GDP and an actual decline in population ) . 
Why , then , are so many central bankers so worried about low inflation rates ? 
One possible explanation is that they are concerned about the loss of credibility implied by setting an inflation target of 2 % and then failing to come close to it year after year . 
Another possibility is that the world &apos;s major central banks are actually more concerned about real growth and employment , and are using low inflation rates as an excuse to maintain exceptionally generous monetary conditions . 
And yet a third explanation is that central bankers want to keep interest rates low in order to reduce the budget cost of large government debts . 
None of this might matter were it not for the fact that extremely low interest rates have fueled increased risk-taking by borrowers and yield-hungry lenders . 
The result has been a massive mispricing of financial assets .
