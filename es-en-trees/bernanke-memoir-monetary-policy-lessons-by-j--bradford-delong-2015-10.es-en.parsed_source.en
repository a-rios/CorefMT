The Tragedy of Ben Bernanke 
BERKELEY - It is difficult to read former US Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke &apos;s new memoir , The Courage to Act , as anything other than a tragedy . 
It is the story of a man who may have been the best-prepared person in the world for the job he was given , but who soon found himself outmatched by its challenges , quickly falling behind the curve and never quite managing to catch up . 
It is to Bernanke &apos;s great credit that the shock of 2007-2008 did not trigger another Great Depression . 
In 2000 , Bernanke had argued that a central bank with sufficient will could &quot; always , &quot; in the medium term at least , restore full prosperity via quantitative easing . 
If a central bank printed money and bought financial assets on a large-enough scale , people would begin to step up their spending . 
Even if people believed that only a fraction of quantitative easing was permanent , and even if the incentive to spend was low , the central bank could restart the economy . 
In the end however , Bernanke did not deliver . 
Even though the Fed and many other central banks printed much more money than economists would have thought necessary to offset the impact of the financial crisis , full prosperity has yet to be restored . 
Bernanke increased the US monetary base five-fold , from $ 800 billion to $ 4 trillion . 
And then , his courage failing , he balked at taking the next leap : more than doubling the monetary base to $ 9 trillion . 
In his last years in office , Bernanke was reduced to begging in vain for Congress to institute fiscal expansion . 
So what went wrong ? 
The answer , as is often the case , depends on which economist you ask . 
If I understand Bernanke correctly , he would argue that nothing fundamental went wrong , and that a temporary savings glut has artificially lengthened the time it takes for aggressive monetary expansion to restore full prosperity . 
Loss-adverse sovereign wealth funds , emerging-market millionaires parking their money in the US and Europe , and governments seeking to ensure freedom of action have pushed full-prosperity interest rates down substantially and extended the time it takes for shocks to dissipate . 
Harvard &apos;s Kenneth Rogoff holds a different view : Bernanke &apos;s cardinal error was to focus too narrowly on the money supply . 
According to simple economic models , when the money market is in full-prosperity equilibrium , the debt market is too . 
But in the real world , it might have been more effective for governments to buy back risky debts and induce lenders to write off losses . 
This , more than loose monetary policy , would have boosted private spending and rapidly restored full prosperity . 
Still others would make the case that monetary action would have been enough , if only the Fed had committed to a target for annual inflation that was higher than 2 % and vowed to do as much quantitative easing as necessary to reach that goal . 
This simple promise - were it to be made credible - would have been far more effective than much larger amounts of quantitative easing . 
Finally , there is a fourth view , championed most prominently by Larry Summers and Paul Krugman . 
They argue that there is little evidence that monetary policy will ever restore full prosperity . 
In this view , Milton Friedman &apos;s dream of using strategic monetary interventions to offset economic shocks remains just that : a dream . 
It was only the unique circumstance in Europe and the US over the last half-century - most notably rapid demographic and productivity growth - that made his ideas seem plausible . 
&quot; If nobody believes that inflation will rise , it won &apos;t , &quot; is how Krugman put it . 
&quot; The only way to be at all sure of raising inflation is to accompany a changed monetary regime with a burst of fiscal stimulus . &quot; 
I do not claim to know which of these views is the correct one . 
For Keynes , the answer was clear , and it was something close to what is being argued by Summers and Krugman ; indeed , his conclusions are what transformed him from a monetarist into a Keynesian . 
&quot; It seems unlikely that the influence of &#91; monetary &#93; policy on the rate of interest will be sufficient by itself , &quot; Keynes wrote in 1936 . 
&quot; I conceive , therefore , that a somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment will prove the only means of securing an approximation to full employment . &quot; 
Those are words worth considering the next time we find ourselves needing the courage to act .
