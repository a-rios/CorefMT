The Battle for Turkey &apos;s Constitution 
ISTANBUL - On September 12 , Turks will vote on a set of constitutional amendments proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , which has been in power for eight years . Since the vote falls on the 30th anniversary of the 1980 military coup , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is portraying the referendum as an opportunity to reject the military regime &apos;s legacy . 
Turkey &apos;s constitution has been amended repeatedly since the coup . 
But its anti-democratic core remains intact - and , unfortunately , the current proposals do not dramatically alter that . 
Most of the previous amendments relied on agreements between governing and opposition parties , and were not put to a popular vote . 
This time , the AKP acted on its own and was barely able to garner from its own ranks the requisite majority for a referendum . 
Far from being an occasion for popular condemnation of the coup on its anniversary , the referendum is a mark of the AKP &apos;s failure to gain widespread support for its project . 
With another general election due next year , civil-society groups preferred that priority be given to lowering the 10 % electoral threshold for parties to enter parliament , thus broadening political participation . 
That , however , was out of the question : the AKP benefited from the rules put in place for the 2002 and 2007 general elections , in both cases converting pluralities of the popular vote into large parliamentary majorities . 
In 2007 , the AKP government briefly seemed interested in a new constitution , having weathered threats of a military coup just before the elections . 
A distinguished group of academics was assigned to produce a draft . 
But , before any public debate could occur , the AKP decided to amend only two articles of the constitution , in order to allow female university students to wear headscarves on campus . 
The amendment won parliamentary approval , but was subsequently rejected by the Constitutional Court . 
Moreover , in a case brought to the Constitutional Court , the AKP &apos;s support for the amendment was used as evidence that the party was violating Turkey &apos;s secular constitution . 
In the end , the party was found guilty and subjected to a fine . 
From the AKP &apos;s point of view , the Constitutional Court - and the judiciary in general - had replaced the military as the last bastion of Turkey &apos;s secularist establishment . 
The AKP then drafted a set of constitutional amendments that would change the composition of the Constitutional Court and of the Supreme Council of Judges and Public Prosecutors , the body that handles the nomination and promotion of judges and prosecutors . 
Other proposed changes were added for democratic window-dressing . 
Indeed , the AKP insisted on submitting the entire package to a single &quot; yes / no &quot; vote , despite repeated calls from civil-society groups and opposition parties to allow for votes on each amendment separately . 
One new &quot; democratic &quot; amendment would create an ombudsman &apos;s office - long demanded by the European Union - but without a guarantee of autonomy . 
Likewise , an affirmative-action clause for women is little different from a provision in the current constitution . 
State employees would be granted the right to engage in collective bargaining , but would have no right to strike . 
The authority of military courts would be curtailed to some extent . 
Most important among such amendments is the repeal of Provisional Article 15 , which has provided immunity from prosecution to all actors of the military regime established by the 1980 coup . 
Whatever symbolic value this may have is overshadowed by the fact that the statute of limitations already precludes any legal action on this issue . 
Opposition proposals to sharpen this provision were rejected by AKP leaders . 
On the other hand , the key amendments sought by the AKP would increase the number of seats on the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Council , but without changing significantly the way appointments to these bodies are made . 
The president - to be directly elected in the future given another AKP-initiated amendment that was approved by a referendum in 2007 - thus maintains the predominant role , which underscores the AKP &apos;s confidence that it will continue to control the presidency in the years ahead . 
But Turkish voters care less about these amendments than about jobs , social security , and the continuing loss of lives in the never-ending war with the PKK Kurdish rebels . 
The AKP has largely squandered the goodwill that first brought it to power on a wave of voter revulsion at the old political elite &apos;s rampant corruption . 
It has now created its own elite and shares the same political culture . 
People will base their votes in the referendum not on the substance of the amendments , but on how they feel about the AKP &apos;s eight years in power . 
Nationalist right-wing and statist left-of-center groups are campaigning against the amendments , Islamist-leaning groups support them , and Kurdish groups advocate a referendum boycott , wishing to support neither the old establishment nor the current government . 
Moreover , the socialist and the liberal left are divided over whether some progress is better than none , with opponents arguing that half-hearted changes to the constitution would preclude eventual real reform . 
With the campaign dragging on for months , the referendum has thoroughly polarized Turkish politics . 
Win or lose , that is unlikely to change .
