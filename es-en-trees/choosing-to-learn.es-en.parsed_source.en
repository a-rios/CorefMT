Choosing to Learn 
STOCKHOLM - The Nordic countries &quot; economies are performing well , and a part of the reason is that they are gradually reforming their &quot; social model , &quot; adapting it to new realities in ways that respond to people &apos;s demands . 
On the contrary , it is one that others can emulate . 
Obviously , such a policy requires significant investment in research and development . 
Sweden , for example , invests more than any other European country in this area - well above the EU target of 3 % of GDP . 
Many countries invest less , and even Sweden &apos;s 4 % of GDP might not be enough , given higher spending on R D in China , India , and the United States . 
Moreover , large investments in R D may be of limited use if knowledge can &apos;t be transformed into successful businesses . 
That requires adopting policies that cover everything from kindergarten training to collaboration between universities and companies , as well as an overall business climate in which success is rewarded and failure is not treated as a human catastrophe . 
America &apos;s success is to a great extent based on this kind of thinking . 
Unfortunately , most European educational systems are based on outdated practices and theories . 
Although educational possibilities and structures have gradually been diversified , the major shortcoming of most European educational systems remains : students have too few choices , and teachers , if they want to remain in their profession , must adhere to a severely compartmentalized pedagogy . 
As with corporate monopolies , the consumers ( students ) are often seen as a homogeneous mass , where all students can be educated according to the same pedagogical approach . 
Other countries might find Sweden &apos;s system worth studying . 
Its schools are financed by local communities and work within the framework of a national curriculum designed by the parliament and government . 
Anyone - parents , teachers , or even companies - can apply for a license to operate a school . 
The National School Board is , in principle , instructed to approve an application if the proposed school is likely to fulfill the national goals and has a solid financial base . 
Moreover , private schools are not seen as mere supplements to public schools , but as fully-fledged alternatives , so they need not offer something different . 
A community where a private school offers its services must support it with the same amount of money , or vouchers , per student that it provides to public schools . 
The amount of financing per student is the same , and schools that receive vouchers cannot charge additional fees . 
After this system was adopted in the 1990 &quot; s , many non-public schools were established . 
The pioneers were often parents &quot; or teachers &quot; cooperatives , usually with a special pedagogical philosophy . 
Companies operating chains of schools later came to play an important role as well . 
As a result , the variety of schools has increased throughout Sweden . 
The voucher system means that all students , irrespective of family income , can attend the school of their choice . 
Even in rural areas , there is now a wide choice of schools , and it seems that competition has improved the overall quality of Swedish schools , as non-public schools &quot; very existence has created a demand for reform of public schools . 
If there is any difference , it seems that non-public schools often are better than public schools in dealing with children with learning problems . 
There are , of course many alternatives to what Sweden has done to revitalize education . 
Sweden &apos;s voucher educational system is probably the most ambitions of its kind in the world . 
This is all the more remarkable insofar as the principle of competition on which it relies has taken root in a country where competition within the area of public services has not generally been accepted .
