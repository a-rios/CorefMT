A New Trans-American Partnership 
MONTEVIDEO - Many foreign-policy analysts say that the United States &quot; relationship with Latin America is one of &quot; benign neglect . &quot; 
US officials dispute this , arguing that American companies are among the region &apos;s largest foreign direct investors , while 11 of the US &apos;s 20 free-trade agreements ( FTAs ) are with Latin American countries . 
And insofar as &quot; benign neglect &quot; might be a fair description , it is a positive one , characterized by the absence of geopolitical tension or instability in the region . 
But much more could be done - especially on trade policy - to deepen US-Latin American economic relations . 
Since the breakdown of the Doha Round of global trade talks , the US has been involved in two major international trade negotiations . 
Both proposed FTAs - the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , mainly a US-Asia initiative , and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) , a largely US-Europe project - are far-reaching agreements . 
They aim to restore momentum toward an open global trade regime , including progress on contentious issues like trade in services , intellectual property rights , government procurement , and the harmonization of safety , health , and technical standards . 
Their participants account for 60 % of world GDP . 
However , they do not reach all places . 
Though Chile , Peru , and Mexico have also signed up to the TPP - and other Latin American countries are welcome to join it - the region &apos;s involvement is marginal . 
If that is to change , the region will need to rediscover the spirit of the 1994 Summit of the Americas , where US President Bill Clinton and his Latin American counterparts set out a grand vision for the hemisphere . 
Their idea was to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) , which would allow goods , capital , and people to move freely anywhere between Alaska and Tierra del Fuego . 
One way to revive that spirit of cooperation and common purpose would be to create a new Trans-American Partnership . 
The TAP would include the US , Canada , Mexico , the Pacific Alliance countries , and other Latin American states that already have FTAs with the US . 
The TAP would also embrace almost half of Latin America &apos;s population and include around 50 % of its combined GDP , giving the region the central role that it lacks in the TPP or the TTIP . 
The only major economy that would not initially be in the TAP would be Brazil . 
But this would surely change as its dynamic private sector , facing down the government &apos;s protectionist instincts , lobbied for membership - a proposition that would become difficult to resist as the TAP &apos;s influence spread . 
The TAP could be established and promoted relatively cheaply , by building on and harmonizing current bilateral trade agreements with the US , as many of the Pacific Alliance members have been doing . 
Moreover , TAP membership would be voluntary , an important advantage over the FTAA . 
Most important , the TAP would create a sense of a shared future for the Americas . 
It could become a formidable force supporting free trade , investment , prosperity , and indeed peace in a multi-polar world . 
Such large trade agreements have become particularly important as a means to bridge the two competing economic and ideological models that increasingly divide the world : China and Russia &apos;s authoritarian state capitalism and Western-style democracy and rule of law . 
There are positive signs that US policy is moving in the right direction . 
In his November 2013 speech at the Organization of American States , US Secretary of State John Kerry said that partnership with Latin America &quot; will require courage and a willingness to change . 
But above all , it will require a higher and deeper level of cooperation between us , all of us together , as equal partners in this hemisphere . &quot; 
A new , wide-ranging free-trade agreement , with Latin America at its heart , would be an excellent way to realize these hopes .
