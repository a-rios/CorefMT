The New Mercantilist Challenge 
CAMBRIDGE - The history of economics is largely a struggle between two opposing schools of thought , &quot; liberalism &quot; and &quot; mercantilism . &quot; 
Economic liberalism , with its emphasis on private entrepreneurship and free markets , is today &apos;s dominant doctrine . 
But its intellectual victory has blinded us to the great appeal - and frequent success - of mercantilist practices . 
In fact , mercantilism remains alive and well , and its continuing conflict with liberalism is likely to be a major force shaping the future of the global economy . 
Today , mercantilism is typically dismissed as an archaic and blatantly erroneous set of ideas about economic policy . 
And , in their heyday , mercantilists certainly did defend some very odd notions , chief among which was the view that national policy ought to be guided by the accumulation of precious metals - gold and silver . 
Adam Smith &apos;s 1776 treatise The Wealth of Nations masterfully demolished many of these ideas . 
Smith showed , in particular , that money should not be confused for wealth . 
As he put it , &quot; the wealth of a country consists , not in its gold and silver only , but in its lands , houses , and consumable goods of all different kinds . &quot; 
But it is more accurate to think of mercantilism as a different way to organize the relationship between the state and the economy - a vision that holds no less relevance today than it did in the eighteenth century . 
Mercantilist theorists such as Thomas Mun were in fact strong proponents of capitalism ; they just propounded a different model than liberalism . 
The liberal model views the state as necessarily predatory and the private sector as inherently rent-seeking . 
So it advocates a strict separation between the state and private business . 
Mercantilism , by contrast , offers a corporatist vision in which the state and private business are allies and cooperate in pursuit of common objectives , such as domestic economic growth or national power . 
The mercantilist model can be derided as state capitalism or cronyism . 
But when it works , as it has so often in Asia , the model &apos;s &quot; government-business collaboration &quot; or &quot; pro-business state &quot; quickly garners heavy praise . 
Lagging economies have not failed to notice that mercantilism can be their friend . 
Even in Britain , classical liberalism arrived only in the mid-nineteenth century - that is , after the country had become the world &apos;s dominant industrial power . 
A second difference between the two models lies in whether consumer or producer interests are privileged . 
For liberals , consumers are king . 
The ultimate objective of economic policy is to increase households &quot; consumption potential , which requires giving them unhindered access to the cheapest-possible goods and services . 
Mercantilists , by contrast , emphasize the productive side of the economy . 
For them , a sound economy requires a sound production structure . 
And consumption needs to be underpinned by high employment at adequate wages . 
These different models have predictable implications for international economic policies . 
The logic of the liberal approach is that the economic benefits of trade arise from imports : the cheaper the imports , the better , even if the result is a trade deficit . 
Mercantilists , however , view trade as a means of supporting domestic production and employment , and prefer to spur exports rather than imports . 
Today &apos;s China is the leading bearer of the mercantilist torch , though Chinese leaders would never admit it - too much opprobrium still attaches to the term . 
Much of China &apos;s economic miracle is the product of an activist government that has supported , stimulated , and openly subsidized industrial producers - both domestic and foreign . 
Although China phased out many of its explicit export subsidies as a condition of membership in the World Trade Organization ( which it joined in 2001 ) , mercantilism &apos;s support system remains largely in place . 
In particular , the government has managed the exchange rate to maintain manufacturers &quot; profitability , resulting in a sizable trade surplus ( which has come down recently , but largely as a result of an economic slowdown ) . 
Moreover , export-oriented firms continue to benefit from a range of tax incentives . 
From the liberal perspective , these export subsidies impoverish Chinese consumers while benefiting consumers in the rest of the world . 
A recent study by the economists Fabrice Defever and Alejandro Ria√±o of the University of Nottingham puts the &quot; losses &quot; to China at around 3 % of Chinese income , and gains to the rest of the world at around 1 % of global income . 
From the mercantilist perspective , however , these are simply the costs of building a modern economy and setting the stage for long-term prosperity . 
As the example of export subsidies shows , the two models can co-exist happily in the world economy . 
Liberals should be happy to have their consumption subsidized by mercantilists . 
Indeed , that , in a nutshell , is the story of the last six decades : a succession of Asian countries managed to grow by leaps and bounds by applying different variants of mercantilism . 
Governments in rich countries for the most part looked the other way while Japan , South Korea , Taiwan , and China protected their home markets , appropriated &quot; intellectual property , &quot; subsidized their producers , and managed their currencies . 
We have now reached the end of this happy coexistence . 
The liberal model has become severely tarnished , owing to the rise in inequality and the plight of the middle class in the West , together with the financial crisis that deregulation spawned . 
Medium-term growth prospects for the American and European economies range from moderate to bleak . 
Unemployment will remain a major headache and preoccupation for policymakers . 
So mercantilist pressures will likely intensify in the advanced countries . 
As a result , the new economic environment will produce more tension than accommodation between countries pursuing liberal and mercantilist paths . 
It may also reignite long-dormant debates about the type of capitalism that produces the greatest prosperity .
