The Cultural Contradictions of Multiculturalism 
STOCKHOLM - State-sponsored multiculturalism has failed . 
That proclamation by British Prime Minister David Cameron , following hard on the heels of similar renunciations of multiculturalism by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy , suggests that a page is being turned in European society . 
But is it ? 
Cameron &apos;s attack on multiculturalism minced no words . 
&quot; Frankly , &quot; he said , &quot; we need a lot less of the passive tolerance of recent years and a much more active , muscular liberalism . &quot; 
He was not criticizing ethnic and cultural pluralism , but the idea of &quot; state multiculturalism , &quot; which applies different moral standards to various social groups . 
In the future , Cameron declared , Muslim groups that do not , for example , endorse women &apos;s rights , defend freedom of expression , or promote integration would lose all government funding . 
It is not just official multiculturalism that has failed in Europe , however ; so has the multiculturalism endorsed by large parts of European civil society . 
Sweden , one of the most liberal countries in the world , but also one that has recently seen a surge in extremism , is a case in point . 
Sweden has long been known for its lifestyle liberalism . 
Swedes are overwhelmingly secular and indifferent toward the Swedish church . 
Homosexuals have been able to register civil partnerships since 1995 and marry since 2009 , and the country is one of the most radical in its understanding of women &apos;s rights - as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange can attest . 
Moreover , Sweden &apos;s far-reaching freedom of expression is one reason why Assange located WikiLeaks &quot; servers in the country . 
But Sweden &apos;s freedom of expression was also one of the motives behind a grisly suicide attack in Stockholm in December of last year . 
According to a last testament left behind by the attacker , a Swedish citizen named Taimour Abdulwahab , Christmas shoppers in downtown Stockholm had to die in retaliation for &quot; the Swedes &quot; support &quot; for Lars Vilks , an artist who stirred outrage in the country with drawings of the Prophet Muhammad as a dog . 
Vilks argued that his work was a provocation aimed at revealing the selective liberalism within the Swedish intellectual establishment - its multiculturalism , one could say . 
The Stockholm suicide bombing was not the first act of violence linked to Vilks . 
Two young men were recently sentenced to prison for trying to set fire to the artist &apos;s home . 
During a lecture at Uppsala University last summer , a mob attacked Vilks , a professor of art history , while crying Allahu akbar . 
The then 64-year-old artist was head-butted , but escaped serious injury thanks to heavy police protection . 
What is remarkable is not just the violence and threats against Vilks - anyone who doubts the determination of Islamist extremists in Sweden should watch the YouTube clip from that lecture - but also the reaction from the otherwise radically secular Swedish establishment . 
A number of influential Swedish intellectuals and politicians have directed their harshest criticism against Vilks , not against those who have called for censorship and even incited violence . 
Only a few of the country &apos;s newspapers and political magazines published Vilks &quot; drawings . 
Like murdered Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh and the British novelist Salman Rushdie before him , Vilks was criticized by liberals and the left for causing unrest with his art . 
In this respect , Vilks &quot; work must be regarded as having succeeded in exposing moral double standards - no matter what one thinks of the drawing itself . 
In Sweden , just as in similarly liberal Holland and Denmark , right-wing populists have profited from liberals &quot; failure to stand up for their values . 
The Sweden Democrats ( SD ) , a party with roots in the country &apos;s white-supremacist movement , entered the parliament for the first time in September 2010 , with the support of 5.7 % of the Swedish electorate . 
The SD has sought to position itself as the sole defender of gays and Jews in the face of intolerance stoked by large-scale Muslim immigration in the past two decades . 
Swedes who stand far from the SD &apos;s original platform are apparently willing to be represented by a party that until recently was full of neo-Nazis . 
Thus , the lack of &quot; muscular liberalism &quot; in one of the world &apos;s most liberal countries has paved the way for both Islamists and right-wing populists . 
Europe &apos;s leading politicians have spoken out , and now it is time for European civil society - its newspapers , critics , curators , academics , and publishers - to declare the failure of multiculturalism and show some courage in defending the values they claim to embody .
