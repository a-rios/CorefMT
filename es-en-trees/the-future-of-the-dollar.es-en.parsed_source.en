The Future of the Dollar 
CAMBRIDGE - American economic policy aims for a dollar that is strong at home and competitive abroad . 
A strong dollar at home means a dollar that retains its purchasing power , thanks to a low rate of inflation . 
A competitive dollar abroad means that other countries should not implement policies that artificially depress the value of their currencies in order to promote exports and deter imports . 
The goal of a strong dollar at home has guided the Federal Reserve at least since Paul Volcker crushed inflation in the early 1980 &quot; s . 
Although the United States does not have a formal inflation target , financial markets understand that the Fed aims for an inflation rate close to 2 % . 
And , while the law mandates the Fed to ensure sustainable growth as well as low inflation , monetary officials recognize that sustainable growth requires price stability . 
For decades , US Treasury officials have insisted that &quot; A strong dollar is good for America . &quot; 
But that slogan has never been a guide to official US action in international markets . 
The Treasury does not intervene in currency markets to bolster the dollar , and the Fed does not raise interest rates for that purpose . 
Instead , the US stresses to foreign governments that an effective global trading system requires not only the removal of formal trade barriers , but also the absence of policies aimed at causing currency values that promote large trade surpluses . 
In recent years , countries around the world have accumulated very large volumes of foreign exchange , topped by China with more than $ 2 trillion , but including hundreds of billions of dollars held by Korea , Taiwan , Singapore , India , and the oil-producing countries . 
Most of these funds are now invested in dollar securities . 
The US dollar is and will remain these countries &quot; major investment currency , reflecting the depth of the US capital market and the relatively favorable outlook for US government policies . 
These large foreign-exchange reserves are no longer held to buffer temporary trade imbalances . 
While some of the funds serve that purpose and must be held in the most liquid form , most of these large holdings are investment funds that will be managed to balance risk and return . 
That means that , over time , these governments will seek to diversify their portfolios , moving away from the current dominance of dollar investments . 
The euro is now the primary alternative to the dollar . 
While the turmoil in Europe and the uncertain future of the euro have caused a pause in the shift from dollars to euros , the rebalancing in favor of euros will resume at some point in the future . 
Countries with large reserves are now overweight dollars , and their effort to balance risks will cause the value of the euro to rise again relative to the dollar . 
Several other currencies now have minor shares in those portfolios , and will continue to do so in the future . 
The major risk to the sustained role of the dollar is the large and growing US national debt . 
After varying between 25 % and 50 % of GDP for the past half-century , the recent budget deficits have caused the debt to reach 62 % of GDP . 
The official non-partisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that the policies that now seem most likely could push the debt to 100 % of GDP by the end of the decade . 
Foreign investors might therefore fear that future US administrations will be tempted to reduce the real value of that debt by allowing a higher inflation rate . 
But that is unlikely , given the Fed &apos;s general anti-inflationary consensus and the very short average maturity - roughly four years - of the national debt . 
Higher inflation would cause the interest rate on new debt to rise in a way that prevents the erosion of the real value of the total debt . 
But foreign investors , who hold nearly half of the US government &apos;s debt now - and are likely to hold an even larger share in the future - could still have reason to worry that the US might someday try to reduce the value of its debt in a way that adversely affects them but not Americans , or that affects all debt holders but relieves the foreign-debt burden on American taxpayers . 
This need not mean outright default ; a plan to repay principal and interest with low-interest securities rather than cash - or to withhold income tax on interest earned from government bonds , crediting those taxes against the obligations of American taxpayers - would achieve the same result . 
While such policies are extremely unlikely , fear of such possibilities could cause foreign investors to shun the dollar . 
The current policies and those proposed in the government &apos;s recent budget would cause the national debt to rise rapidly , but those policies are not inevitable . 
The best protection of the dollar &apos;s future role - and of the health of the US economy - will be policies that reduce the growth of the national debt .
