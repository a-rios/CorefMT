Obama versus Romney on Jobs 
BERKELEY - The United States has just completed its third year of economic recovery , but the unemployment rate remains above 8 % , and there are worrisome signs of a slowdown . 
So it is no surprise that jobs have become a major focus in the presidential campaign - or that the candidates have very different ideas about how to boost employment . 
Last autumn , President Barack Obama proposed the American Jobs Act , a $ 450 billion package of fiscal measures aimed at job creation . 
The AJA amounted to about 3 % of GDP and was designed to take effect in 2012 , providing a timely employment boost and insurance for the US recovery against global headwinds . 
Most of its measures had enjoyed bipartisan support in the past ; tax cuts comprised about 56 % of the total cost ; and the package was paid for in Obama &apos;s long-term deficit reduction plan . 
Several independent economists concluded that Obama &apos;s plan would provide a significant lift to the job market in 2012-2013 . 
Indeed , two of the nation &apos;s most respected forecasters predicted that the AJA would add 1.3-1.9 million jobs in 2012 and more than two million jobs by the end of 2013 . 
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) also found that most of the AJA &apos;s policies ranked high in budgetary effectiveness , measured by the number of jobs created in 2012-2013 per dollar of budgetary cost . 
The AJA was filibustered by Senate Republicans , and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives likewise prevented the bill from coming to a vote . 
Mitt Romney , now the Republican presidential candidate , attacked the plan as &quot; mere stimulus &quot; that would &quot; throw a cup of gasoline on the embers &quot; of the recovery . 
Ultimately , Obama , bolstered by polls endorsing his plan , won partial passage of two AJA policies : a one-third cut in employees &quot; payroll taxes ( he had proposed one-half ) , and an extension of unemployment benefits by about 60 % of what he had recommended . 
But Congress failed to approve a 50 % cut in employers &quot; payroll taxes - a business tax cut that many Republicans favored in the past and that ranks high on budgetary effectiveness . 
Nor did Congress approve $ 30 billion in federal grants to states to enable them to employ about 135,000 teachers , police , and firemen , despite strong voter support . 
Such grants between 2009 and 2011 , totaling $ 130 billion , helped states to maintain vital services and retain the public employees providing them . 
Romney opposes more federal money for the states , arguing that &quot; it is time to cut back on government and help the American people . &quot; 
But teachers , firemen , and police are American people who help other American people . 
Government employment is falling at the fastest rate since the 1940 &quot; s , and is now at its 2006 level . 
If public employment had grown during the last three years at about the same rate as the population , as it did during George W. Bush &apos;s presidency , the unemployment rate would be around 7 % rather than 8.2 % , owing to about 800,000 additional jobs . 
Likewise , Congress failed to approve Obama &apos;s call for $ 90 billion in additional infrastructure spending , which would have supported about 400,000 jobs , despite the fact that the US has at least $ 1.1 trillion in unfunded infrastructure needs . 
Moreover , infrastructure investment not only creates jobs in the near term , but also promotes long-term competitiveness . 
Altogether , Congress left at least one million jobs on the negotiating table , holding unemployed workers hostage to the outcome of November &apos;s election . 
Meanwhile , in response to persistent media pressure , Romney has unveiled his policies to boost short-term job creation . 
They are not convincing . 
Romney says that he would ensure that the US puts more people to work in the energy sector . 
And , while Romney says that he would open new foreign markets , Obama has been doing just that , winning passage of three major trade agreements and increasing federal support for US exports , which have been growing nearly twice as fast as they did during the recovery from the 2001 recession . 
Moreover , Romney &apos;s promise to charge China , America &apos;s third-largest export market , with currency manipulation , and to impose large tariffs on Chinese imports , would almost certainly invite retaliation , causing a decline in US exports and jobs . 
Romney would also repeal &quot; Obamacare &quot; - the 2010 health-care reform legislation - because it &quot; is scaring small business from hiring . &quot; 
But the evidence for this claim is meager and anecdotal . A recent survey found that most small businesses support the reform . 
Most businesses , large and small , cite insufficient demand as the primary reason they are not hiring . 
Nor is Romney &apos;s promise to enact immediate cuts in federal discretionary spending by an additional 5 % likely to boost job growth , as he asserts . 
When an economy is suffering from high unemployment and weak aggregate demand , spending cuts are contractionary . 
Romney conceded this point recently , acknowledging that the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; - the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts at the end of this year , combined with large spending cuts already scheduled to take effect - would push the economy back into recession . 
Finally , in addition to extending Bush &apos;s tax cuts , Romney promises an across-the-board 20 % reduction in marginal personal-income-tax rates and a significant cut in the corporate rate to encourage businesses to hire more workers . 
Despite large cuts in marginal income-tax rates at the start of the Bush administration , however , job growth between 2000 and 2007 was half the rate of the previous three decades . 
Even if Romney &apos;s new tax cuts strengthened investment and growth in the long run ( a debatable proposition that depends on how they are financed ) , their short-term effect on job creation would be minimal , and they would entail a significant loss of revenue . 
Indeed , these cuts perform poorly on the CBO &apos;s measure of budgetary effectiveness . 
Obama &apos;s proposals to boost job creation are convincing , whereas Romney &apos;s proposals would have little or no effect - and some could even make matters worse . 
Voters need to know the difference .
