Olympolitik 
PARIS - Is there a link between economic power and Olympic medals ? 
Is a form of multipolarity in sports emerging as political multipolarity sets in ? 
In 1992 , immediately after the Cold War &apos;s end , the United States and the former Soviet Union &apos;s &quot; Unified Team &quot; won a quarter of the medals in Barcelona . 
Global bipolarity had not yet vanished . 
By the 2008 Beijing games , the world had changed significantly . 
The Soviet-American duopoly had given way to a Sino-American duopoly , which won a combined 20 % of the medals . 
The London games confirmed this trend . 
The Sino-American duopoly has loomed large in the medal count ( 22 % of the total ) , but not outrageously so . 
Europe remains strong , while Asia and the Caribbean have made significant headway . 
There are , in fact , four factors behind Olympic power : population size , sports traditions , sports policy , and level of development . 
Taken separately , none of these factors can explain a country &apos;s Olympic record . 
Collectively , however , their explanatory power is relatively large . 
For starters , population size is a source of power simply because large countries can take advantage of their greater human potential to shine in a broad array of disciplines . 
Countries with great demographic potential therefore inherently have great Olympic potential . 
Conversely , Australia appears to be the only country with less than 50 million inhabitants gaining more than 3 % of the medals at a Summer Olympic Games . 
But , of course , a large population is not always a recipe for success . 
The most striking example is India , one of the least sports-oriented countries in the world , given its demographics : six medals for more than 1.2 billion inhabitants - the same number as Croatia , which has a population of just 4.3 million ! 
Clearly , Indian society has a complex relationship with sports . 
But the disparity between its demographic size and its Olympic success also shows that political multipolarity and sports multipolarity are not cast from the same mold . 
India is probably the most spectacular counter-example , but it is not the only one . 
Countries like Brazil , Argentina , Turkey , and Mexico are dwarfed by countries like South Korea . 
Overall , it is fair to say that South America and the Middle East remain fringe players at the Olympics . 
The Caribbean , for example , far outranks Brazil . 
National traditions are the second important factor in Olympic success . 
First , there are physical and natural realities . 
Ethiopians begin running in childhood as a means to reach , say , a distant school in the highlands . 
And the Caribbean does not necessarily offer many sports activities besides track and field , for which relatively few material resources are needed to create champions . 
This is one of the reasons why East Africa , the Caribbean , and to a lesser extent the Maghreb are prominently represented in Olympic running disciplines . 
But traditions can also be created . 
The French are not culturally or physically predisposed to dominate sports such as judo , canoeing , and swimming , in which they have achieved distinction for more than 50 years . 
A national sports policy can be conducive to good results . 
Such policies embody a country &apos;s choice in developing one or several sports . 
They can grant a great deal of autonomy to various federations ( as in the US and Great Britain ) ; devote significant public resources to sports for political purposes ( as in Russia and other dictatorships ) ; or insulate publicly financed sports institutions from partisan politics in order to ensure continuity ( as in Italy and France ) . 
On the other hand , the absence of a real sports policy ( or its unraveling ) can become a decisive handicap . 
Indeed , how else to explain the poor performance of a country as well-endowed as Switzerland , or as highly populated as Nigeria ? 
And what accounts for South Korea &apos;s exceptional performance if not a coherent sports policy ? 
Finally , a country &apos;s level of development , as we have seen , is far from being decisive to Olympic success , especially in the running disciplines . 
Runners can travel and train individually on the best tracks . 
Obviously , however , development does play a significant role . 
While sports like running are relatively inexpensive , others - including gymnastics , swimming , and even more so team games and equestrian events - require significant resources . 
It is no coincidence that the Caribbean and Africa do not have a presence in these disciplines at the highest levels of competition . 
Indeed , of the ten countries that received the most medals at the London games , all except China and Russia are OECD members . 
There are no less-developed countries , with the possible exception of Ukraine , in the top 15 . 
Thus , while economic power is not a prerequisite to Olympic power , multipolarity in sports remains positively correlated with it . 
Africa received only 3 % of all medals in London . 
But , if the continent can sustain its recent economic growth , that number will almost surely rise .
