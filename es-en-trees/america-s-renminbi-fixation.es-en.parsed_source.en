America \ u0027s Renminbi Fixation 
NEW YORK - For seven years , the United States has allowed its fixation on the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate to deflect attention from far more important issues in its economic relationship with China . 
The upcoming Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the US and China is an excellent opportunity to examine - and rethink - America &apos;s priorities . 
Since 2005 , the US Congress has repeatedly flirted with legislation aimed at defending hard-pressed American workers from the presumed threat of a cheap Chinese currency . 
Bipartisan support for such a measure surfaced when Senators Charles Schumer ( a liberal Democrat from New York ) and Lindsey Graham ( a conservative Republican from South Carolina ) introduced the first Chinese currency bill . 
The argument for legislative action is tantalizingly simple : the US merchandise trade deficit has averaged a record 4.4 % of GDP since 2005 , with China accounting for fully 35 % of the shortfall , supposedly owing to its currency manipulation . 
The Chinese , insists a broad coalition of politicians , business leaders , and academic economists , must revalue or face sanctions . 
This reasoning resonates with the US public . 
As such , the currency debate looms as a major issue in the upcoming US presidential campaign . 
&quot; Enough is enough , &quot; President Barack Obama replied , when queried on the renminbi in the aftermath of his last meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao . 
Obama &apos;s presumptive Republican challenger , Mitt Romney , has promised to declare China guilty of currency manipulation the day he takes office . 
But , however appealing this logic may be , it is wrong . 
First , America &apos;s trade deficit is multilateral : the US ran deficits with 88 nations in 2010 . 
A multilateral imbalance - especially one that it is traceable to a saving shortfall - cannot be fixed by putting pressure on a bilateral exchange rate . 
Indeed , America &apos;s major threat is from within . 
Blaming China merely impedes the heavy lifting that must be done at home - namely , boosting saving by cutting budget deficits and encouraging households to save income rather than rely on asset bubbles . 
Second , the renminbi has now appreciated 31.4 % against the dollar since mid-2005 , well in excess of the 27.5 % increase called for by the original Schumer-Graham bill . 
Mindful of the lessons of Japan - especially its disastrous concession on sharp yen appreciation in the Plaza Accord of 1985 - the Chinese have opted , instead , for a gradual revaluation . 
Recent moves toward renminbi internationalization , a more open capital account , and wider currency trading bands leave little doubt that the endgame is a market-based , fully convertible renminbi . 
Third , there has been significant improvement in China &apos;s external imbalance . 
The International Monetary Fund estimates that China &apos;s current-account surplus will narrow to just 2.3 % of GDP in 2012 , after peaking at 10.1 % in 2007 . 
American officials have long bemoaned China &apos;s saving glut as a major source of global instability . 
But they should look in the mirror : America &apos;s current-account deficit this year , at an estimated $ 510 billion , is likely to be 2.8 times higher than China &apos;s surplus . 
Finally , China has evolved from the world &apos;s factory to its assembly line . 
Research shows that no more than 20 % to 30 % of Chinese exports to the US reflect value added inside China . 
Roughly 60 % of Chinese exports represent shipments of &quot; foreign invested enterprises &quot; - in effect , Chinese subsidiaries of global multinationals . 
Think Apple . 
Globalized production platforms distort bilateral trade data between the US and China , and have little to do with the exchange rate . 
Rather than vilifying China as the principal economic threat to America , the relationship should be recast as an opportunity . 
The largest component of US aggregate demand - the consumer - is on ice . 
With households focused on repairing severely damaged balance sheets , inflation-adjusted private consumption has expanded at an anemic 0.5 % average annual rate over the past four years . 
Consumer deleveraging is likely to persist for years to come , leaving the US increasingly desperate for new sources of growth . 
Exports top the list of possibilities . 
China is now America &apos;s third largest and most rapidly growing export market . 
There can be no mistaking its potential to fill some of the void left by US consumers . 
The key to realizing that opportunity lies in access to Chinese markets - all the more significant in light of China &apos;s upcoming pro-consumption rebalancing . 
Historically , China has had an open development model , with imports running at 28 % of GDP since 2002 - nearly three times Japan &apos;s 10 % import ratio during its high-growth era ( 1960-1989 ) . 
As a result , for a given increment of domestic demand , China is far more predisposed toward foreign sourcing . 
As the Chinese consumer emerges , demand for a wide variety of US-made goods - ranging from new-generation information technology and biotech to automotive components and aircraft - could surge . 
At just 43 % of GDP , China &apos;s services sector is relatively tiny . 
There is enormous scope for America &apos;s global services companies to expand in China , especially in transactions-intensive distribution sectors - wholesale and retail trade , domestic transportation , and supply-chain logistics - as well as in the processing segments of finance , health care , and data warehousing . 
The US needs to refocus the US-China trade agenda toward expanded market access in these and other areas - pushing back against Chinese policies and government procurement practices that favor domestic production and indigenous innovation . 
Some progress has been made , but more is needed - for example , getting China to join the World Trade Organization &apos;s Government Procurement Agreement . 
At the same time , the US should reconsider antiquated Cold War restrictions on Chinese purchases of technology-intensive items . 
For a growth-starved US , the opportunities of market access far outweigh the currency threat . 
The long-dormant Chinese consumer is about to be unleashed . 
This plays to one of America &apos;s greatest strengths - its zeal to compete in new markets . 
Shame on the US if it squanders this extraordinary chance by digging in its heels at the upcoming Strategic and Economic dialogue .
