Now is Our Time 
New York - Every September , the world &apos;s leaders gather at the United Nations to reaffirm our founding Charter - our faith in fundamental principles of peace , justice , human rights , and equal opportunity for all . 
We assess the state of the world , engage key issues of the day , and lay out our vision for the way ahead . 
But this year is different . 
The 64th opening of the General Assembly asks us to rise to an exceptional moment . 
We are facing many crises - food , energy , recession , and pandemic flu - occurring all at once . 
If ever there were a time to act in a spirit of renewed multilateralism , a time to put the &quot; united &quot; back into the United Nations , it is now . 
And that is what we are doing , as action on three issues of historic consequence demonstrates . 
First , world leaders are uniting to address the greatest challenge we face as a human family - the threat of catastrophic climate change . 
Last week , 101 leaders from 163 countries met to chart the next steps toward December &apos;s all-important UN climate change conference in Copenhagen . 
They recognized the need for an agreement that all nations can embrace - in line with their capabilities , consistent with what science requires , and grounded in &quot; green jobs &quot; and &quot; green growth , &quot; the lifeline of a twenty-first century global economy . 
We at the UN have prepared carefully for this moment . 
For two and a half years , ever since I became Secretary-General , we have worked to put climate change at the top of the global agenda . 
Today , we have entered a new phase . 
Last week &apos;s summit sharply defined the issue and focused attention in capitals the world over . 
To be sure , the issues are complex and difficult , especially those of financing adaptation and mitigation efforts in poorer countries . 
Yet leaders left New York committed to clear and firm instructions for their negotiators : seal a deal in Copenhagen . 
Japan issued a challenge , agreeing to cut CO2 emissions by 25 % by 2020 if other nations follow . 
China &apos;s President Hu Jintao spoke about all that his country is already doing to reduce energy intensity and invest in &quot; green &quot; alternatives . 
He emphasized that China is prepared to do more under an international agreement , as did US President Barack Obama . 
Negotiators will gather for another round of UN talks on September 28 in Bangkok , and we are considering a smaller meeting of major emitting and most vulnerable nations in November . 
We need a breakthrough in this make-or-break year . 
We saw another turning point on a second issue of existential importance : nuclear disarmament . 
Finally , the assumption that such weapons are needed to keep the peace is crumbling . 
At a special summit called by the President Obama , the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that opens a new chapter in the UN &apos;s efforts to address nuclear proliferation and disarmament . 
That resolution improves prospects for expanding the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty next May , and offers hope for bringing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty into force . 
It also sets establishes the contours of a legal framework for action against misuse of civilian nuclear technology for military purposes and reflects an emerging consensus , seen in meeting after meeting , that the time has come to increase pressure on countries that fail to respect these principles . 
The world is united on a third front , as well . 
Though some may speak of &quot; turning the corner to recovery , &quot; we see a new crisis emerging . 
According to our recent report , &quot; Voices of the Vulnerable , &quot; the near-poor are becoming the new poor . 
An estimated 100 million people could fall below the poverty line this year . 
Markets may be bouncing back , but jobs and incomes are not . 
That is why , earlier this year , the UN put forward a Global Jobs Pact for balanced and sustainable growth . 
It is also why we are creating a new Global Impact Vulnerability Alert System , giving us real-time data and analysis on socio-economic conditions around the world . 
We need to know precisely who is being hurt by the financial crisis , and where , so that we can best respond . 
That is also why , next year at this time , we will convene a special summit on the Millennium Development Goals . 
We have only five years to meet the targets for health , education , and human security that we set for 2015 . 
At the various G-20 summits over the past year , including the latest in Pittsburg , the UN has stood firm to speak and act for all those being left behind . 
Rhetoric has always been abundant at the General Assembly , action sometimes less so . 
Yet listening to the world &apos;s leaders speak , last week , I was struck by their passion , commitment , and collective determination to turn a page from a past of countries divided by narrow interests to nations united in the cause of a global common good . 
From confronting climate change to creating a world without nuclear weapons to building a more equitable and sustainable global economy , I saw a sprit of renewed multilateralism , with the UN at the fore . 
No country can deal with any of these challenges by itself . 
But as nations united , the United Nations can .
