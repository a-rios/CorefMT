Russia &apos;s &quot; Oil-for-Knowledge &quot; Scheme 
Whenever you fill up your European compact car &apos;s gas tank , or that of your American SUV , you pay as much as a Russian schoolteacher earns in a month . 
You finance the pre-modern and the inefficient , and perhaps worse : every time you pay , you may be collaborating with political evil . 
Russia began 2006 , the year of its chairmanship of the G-8 , by launching a gas war with Ukraine . 
Having a virtual monopoly on supply , Russia decided that it could dictate prices . 
Modern economies rely not on monopolies , but on competition . 
Contemporary Russians consume competitive products : Nestle cereals , Mercedes cars , Hollywood movies . 
The problem is that they do not make them . 
Russians pay for this consumption from the profits of gas and oil . 
State-owned and private multinational companies drill fuel in Russia and sell it to Europe and North America . 
The government partially redistributes profits by collecting taxes and paying salaries . 
Gas prices are growing , and so are Russian salaries . 
This causes inflation , because , other than fuel , Russians do not produce much else . 
To avoid inflation , the government deposits a large part of its profits into a Stabilization Fund . 
But , because the Kremlin does not trust its own stocks and bonds , the Stabilization Fund invests in Western securities . 
Thus , the government loses its chance to modernize Russian cities , roads , hospitals , and universities . 
Mortgages are available at outrageously high interest rates . 
No civil servant , military officer , or professor is able to buy even a modest apartment , unless they have an additional - often illegal - source of income . 
Most don &apos;t . 
Russia exposes an ugly truth of our era : illiberal societies can grow just as fast - even faster - than open ones . 
Oil-rich states need global networks to sell their oil , to export their capital , and to import technologies and technologists . 
Among current United Nations members , countries with large natural resource endowments are also more likely to have a non-democratic regime . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , Mikhail Gorbachev warned that Soviet oil resources were exhausted . 
Of course , due to the Western engineering and management that became available after Gorbachev launched his perestroika reforms , the country was soon producing more oil than ever - indeed , more than was ever believed possible - and oil men like Mikhail Khodorkovsky arose out of the blue . 
But , while machines work everywhere , managers must abide by local traditions and belong to indigenous social networks . 
If the cultural component is important , why share the profits with Western-minded people like Khodorkovsky ? 
So no surprise that other managers , with better relations with those in power , now run Khodorkovsky &apos;s Yukos Oil , as well as another major firm , Sibneft . 
Foreign managers don &apos;t seem to mind . 
On the contrary , some of these managers , such as former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder , who now chairs a Gazprom subsidiary building a pipeline under the Baltic sea , are helping to expand Russia &apos;s oil-based imperial designs over Europe . 
In the strange new world of today , the modern and the pre-modern depend on each other . 
Thus , Russians trade oil for the products of knowledge . 
Imported technologies are cheap if you convert their prices into barrels of oil , so the country produces a shortage of its own geologists and chemists , not to mention economists and lawyers . 
It needs only one gang of politicians . 
In fact , for such a country , local experts are not just redundant , but dangerous . 
In their moments of sincerity , Russian policymakers admit that Russia is , from their point of view , overeducated . 
They recently discovered what their Arab colleagues have known for a long time : that for an oil-rich regime , it is cheaper and safer to buy knowledge than to produce it . 
So hidebound conservatives run Russian universities . 
Scientists go on trial for technical espionage , while ex-KGB spies sign multi-billion dollar contracts . 
Non-governmental organizations are met with suspicion and harassment , with new legislation seemingly designed to vanquish them . 
Political parties are created or banned by anonymous Kremlin clerks . 
Elections are either canceled or faked . 
Oil-poor neighbors like Ukraine are blackmailed . 
An illiberal society can produce growth , but it cannot enjoy it . 
Redistribution schemes benefit the population if , and only if , they are controlled by democratic feedback . 
The Russian Stabilization Fund embodies an unstable combination of anxiety and greed that is typical for an undemocratic regime . 
Dependent on gas , oil , and multinationals , the G-8 countries accept quite a lot of guff from their current chair , Vladimir Putin . 
Still , the arrogance of Russia &apos;s rulers may have breached the West &apos;s tolerance . 
Alternative sources to Russian energy are not the only means to decrease prices . 
Global civil society has developed instruments to halt consumption that produces harm . 
Elegant ladies , for example , no longer buy fur coats . 
Many Westerners eagerly pay more for &quot; Fair Trade &quot; coffee . 
Would a similar approach work for the gas in your oven ? 
A century ago , the idea of decolonization sounded just as absurd . 
Public awareness is as crucial now as it was decisive then .
