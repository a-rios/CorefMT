The Government the Eurozone Deserves 
ATHENS - Will Greece &apos;s troubles destroy Europe &apos;s currency union , or reveal how it should be saved ? 
The recent controversial bailout deal - likened by some to the 1919 Versailles Treaty , with Greece in the role of Germany - offers the latest twist in the eurozone &apos;s existential saga . 
The deal has caused a split in Syriza , Greece &apos;s leftist governing party ; opened a rift between Germany &apos;s Chancellor Angela Merkel and her uncompromisingly tough finance minister , Wolfgang Schäuble ; and spurred an effort by France to reassert itself within the Franco-German axis that has always been the &quot; motor &quot; of European integration . 
Meanwhile , many of North America &apos;s Keynesian economists , such as Nobel laureates Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz , sympathize with Greece &apos;s anti-austerity stance . 
Other economists , mainly in Europe , argue that Germany must assume a political role befitting its economic preeminence and must accept sovereignty-sharing ( and burden-sharing ) arrangements to ensure the monetary union &apos;s cohesion and sustainability . 
Humiliating a small country and rendering it a virtual protectorate does not serve Europe &apos;s long-term interest . 
Yet this is what is at stake . 
Greece signed the deal after facing an explicit invitation from Schäuble to leave the eurozone - supposedly temporarily - and adopt a new currency . 
Germany &apos;s stance marked the first open challenge by a leading European power to the notion that the monetary union is irrevocable . 
As the French , instinctively sympathetic to the anti-austerity argument and conscious of their increasingly junior role in the Franco-German partnership , were quick to notice , the German stance also signaled a potential shift from a &quot; European Germany &quot; to a &quot; German Europe . &quot; 
It hardly helped that the negotiations between Greece and its creditors produced a growing mistrust in the competence and intentions of Syriza . 
Devious and erratic negotiating tactics , coupled with secret schemes to prepare - as part of a &quot; Plan B &quot; - for an exit from the euro , undermined the government &apos;s trustworthiness , leading even Paul Krugman to admit : &quot; I may have overestimated the competence of the Greek government . &quot; 
Yet , however complicated the blame game , some lessons can be drawn to guide future policy . 
When fiscal misbehavior by Greece , a country representing no more than 2 % of the eurozone &apos;s GDP , poses serious dangers for the survival of the currency union , something is clearly amiss . 
But does the remedy lie in tougher measures - such as heavier penalties or even eviction - to enforce the eurozone &apos;s rules , or do the rules need to be adjusted to accommodate members &quot; varying circumstances ? 
So far , enforcement has failed , owing to flaws in the eurozone &apos;s foundations . 
First , fiscal and external-account balances are to be kept in check in order to ensure financial stability and sustain the common currency . 
Second , removing imbalances is the responsibility of national governments within the context of a rescue regime arranged by supranational authorities - the European Commission and the European Central Bank - in cooperation with the European Council , which in turn represents national governments . 
The Greek saga shows that this system cannot control destabilizing imbalances quickly enough to ward off major crises . 
Imbalances are not solely the result of irresponsible policies . 
If Germany insists on national responsibility , it may find that enforcing the rules will have to be ever harsher , eventually leading to such social and political upheaval that the entire euro-edifice collapses . 
The alternative is to embrace a &quot; transfer union &quot; that ensures a better balance between solidarity and responsibility . 
The eurozone must strengthen its fiscal structures enough to respond to overall economic conditions while taking into account the differing circumstances of each member country . 
These stronger structures should permit limited resource transfers among eurozone countries , either to carry out countercyclical policy or to supplement investment spending , particularly in economic and social infrastructure . 
But this must inevitably involve the creation of a separate eurozone budget , transferring competences from national to supranational authorities . 
Common taxation and Eurobonds should form part of the new fiscal structure , and the European Stability Mechanism should include a debt redemption fund large enough to resolve sovereign-debt crises . 
At the same time , the banking union , established by the EU in the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis , should be strengthened by enlarging the capital base of the Single Resolution Fund and establishing a common deposit guarantee scheme . 
All of this presupposes that the powers of the EU &apos;s supranational institutions , the European Parliament and the European Commission , will be significantly augmented . 
The Commission should become a proper government , with a popularly elected president . 
A European finance ministry should be created , and its head should preside over the Eurogroup ( which convenes the finance ministers of eurozone member states ) . 
A special Assembly of the European Parliament , comprising the eurozone members , should have powers - on the model of a national parliament - to legislate and control the executive . 
These proposals will provoke plenty of criticism - and not just from Euroskeptics . 
But a move toward fiscal and political integration is the price that Europe - beginning with the eurozone - must pay to maintain its unity and global relevance . 
The alternative is inconsistent ( if not arbitrary ) enforcement of the current rules , inducing divisiveness among member states and eventual fragmentation .
