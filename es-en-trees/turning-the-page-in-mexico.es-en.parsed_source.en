Turning the Page in Mexico 
Three months from now , when Mexico &apos;s new president Felipe Calderón takes office , many will consider it a dubious honor . 
These are perhaps the only two certainties in Mexico &apos;s politics right now . 
With oil prices higher than ever , its country-risk premiums lower than ever , remittances from abroad , tourism revenues , and foreign investment hitting all time highs , and annual GDP growth estimated at 4.2 % for this year , Mexicans - in many ways - have never had it so good . 
Indeed , after ten years of uninterrupted macroeconomic stability - something Mexico had not experienced since the 1960 &quot; s - the middle class has expanded dramatically , and reasonably priced bank credit is now available to millions who had been excluded in the past . 
Yet , despite these robust changes , poverty remains widespread , inequality abysmal , and social resentment is on the rise . 
This is why Calderón &apos;s opponent in July &apos;s presidential election , the populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador , obtained such a large percentage of the vote compared to the Mexican left &apos;s previous high-water mark in the election of 2000 . 
But it was not enough to win an election that López Obrador and his backers thought was in the bag . 
The extremely tight race - Calderón won by 0.5 % of the vote - and the profound disappointment suffered by López Obrador and his supporters led them to contest the ruling of Mexico &apos;s electoral authorities , and to refuse to acknowledge Calderón &apos;s victory . 
Instead , López Obrador , a former Mexico City mayor , and his supporters demanded a vote-by-vote recount , which is not mandated - though it is not proscribed - by the country &apos;s electoral laws . 
The Electoral Court , however , decided otherwise . 
This is where Mexico stands today : a mess by any definition , with no obvious solution in sight . 
In the long run , the answer undoubtedly lies in the transformation of the Mexican left , and partly also of the Mexican right . 
For years , both were de facto subsumed within the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , which ruled Mexico for seven decades . 
That epoch came to an end in 2000 , and will not return . 
Today , right and left , as well as the PRI itself , are all separate entities , and have a great deal of reconstruction to do . 
The right-of-center Party of National Action ( PAN ) , the grouping of current President Vicente Fox and Calderón , needs to acquire a sincere and profound social conscience . 
It must transform itself into something like the Social Christian or Christian Democratic parties that exist in Costa Rica , Chile , Venezuela , and Peru . 
Otherwise , it will continue to be seen by Mexico &apos;s impoverished masses as the party of the rich - perhaps unfairly , but not entirely unjustly . 
PAN &apos;s metamorphosis is underway , but there is still much work to be done . 
Much more importantly , however - and perhaps to the surprise of many benevolent international observers - the Mexican left is nowhere near transforming itself into a modern , reformist , social-democratic party . 
Not only is it not New Labor ; it is not even like the French , Spanish , or Chilean Socialist Parties , or Brazil &apos;s Workers &quot; Party . 
It continues to be a movement with a revolutionary faction - not a majority , but certainly a large minority - bent on insurrection , socialism , and &quot; anti-imperialist &quot; alignment with Cuba and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez . 
Mexico &apos;s left refuses truly to embrace market economics , representative democracy , and the rule of law . 
Obviously , many of its members and leaders do subscribe to these tenets , and disapprove in private of López Obrador &apos;s rabble-rousing antics . 
But , as long they remain relatively powerless , Mexico will remain unbalanced , deprived of the modern left that it needs to combat poverty and inequality , and hostage to those who still believe in revolution and the assault on the Winter Palace . 
Without these twin transformations of its right and left , Mexico can only keep running in place , while so many others speed forward . 
But change will not happen overnight , so Mexico needs short-term solutions to its travails . 
The most urgent , feasible , and relevant steps involve electoral and legal reforms aimed at avoiding a repeat of the current protests over the presidential vote . 
These include establishing a second-round run-off in presidential elections , so that Mexico &apos;s next president has a mandate supported by more than 50 % of the voters . 
But they also entail the re-election of representatives and senators , recourse to referendums for constitutional amendments , and independent candidacies . 
Perhaps most importantly , Mexico must devise a French-style semi-presidential system whereby a designated Prime Minister is responsible for building majorities in Congress , and must be ratified by the latter . 
Eliminating the purchase of air time on radio and television during campaigns , with the consequent reduction in their cost , would complement these changes . 
None of these indispensable and long-postponed reforms will convince López Obrador &apos;s followers that the end of poverty and inequality in Mexico is around the corner . 
But no significant improvement on these fronts can occur without thoroughly refashioning the country &apos;s decision-making process . 
Fox and his team thought that the mechanisms that worked during the authoritarian period could simply be transferred to the democratic era and function smoothly . 
In fact , none of the major economic and social reforms Mexico desperately needs in order to grow more rapidly , distribute wealth more evenly , and combat poverty more effectively can be passed if the institutional scaffolding is not rebuilt . 
That is what Calderón can and must do in order to render moot today &apos;s debates about the fairness of the election that brought him to power . 
It is time for Mexico to turn the page , but it must turn the right page .
