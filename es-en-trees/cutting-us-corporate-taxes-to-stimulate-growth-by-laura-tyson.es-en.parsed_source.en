Why Give Corporations a Tax Break ? 
BERKELEY - US President Barack Obama has called for additional revenue as part of a balanced plan to reduce future budget deficits . 
To many , this approach seems inconsistent : Shouldn &apos;t the corporate tax rate be raised , not lowered , so that corporations contribute their &quot; fair share &quot; to deficit reduction ? 
The answer is no . 
After its 1986 tax overhaul , the United States had one of the lowest corporate tax rates among OECD countries . 
Since then , these countries have been slashing their rates in order to attract foreign direct investment and discourage their own companies from shifting operations and profits to low-tax foreign locations . 
In the most recent and audacious move , the British government has embarked on a three-year plan to reduce its corporate tax rate from 28 % to 20 % - one of the lowest in the OECD - by 2015 . 
The US now has the highest corporate tax rate of these countries . 
Even after incorporating various deductions , credits , and other tax-reducing provisions , the effective average and marginal corporate tax rates in the US - what corporations actually pay - are higher than the OECD average . 
Cutting the rate to a more competitive level would encourage more domestic investment by US corporations , and would also make the US more attractive to foreign investors . 
Capital has become increasingly mobile , and differences in national corporate tax rates have a growing influence on where multinational companies locate their operations and report their income . 
Higher investment in the US by both domestic and foreign companies would boost economic growth , while the resulting increase in capital - new businesses , factories , equipment , and research -would improve productivity . 
The pro-growth rationale for reducing the US corporate tax rate is compelling , and explains why Obama has proposed cutting it from 35 % to 28 % ( roughly the weighted average rate of the other developed countries ) . 
But a rate cut would be costly in terms of foregone revenues : each percentage point would reduce corporate-tax revenues by about $ 100 billion over the next decade . 
Moreover , recent studies indicate that a significant share of the corporate-tax burden falls on capital , so a reduction in corporate taxes would weaken the progressivity of the tax system at a time when income inequality is at an all-time high . 
For these reasons , Obama is championing a &quot; revenue-neutral &quot; reform that would leave corporate-tax revenues unchanged , with the proposed rate cut financed by limiting deductions , credits , and loopholes , which would broaden the tax base . 
These features add complexity to the tax code , raise the cost of tax compliance , and reduce corporate-tax revenues . 
They also affect business decisions about what to invest in , how to finance investments , which form of business organization to adopt , and where to produce - reflecting sizeable differences in the effective tax rates behind these choices . 
As a result , broadening the corporate tax base will not be easy . 
Within the corporate sector , the three largest domestic tax preferences are the manufacturing production deduction , the credit for research and development , and accelerated depreciation of capital . 
Instead , he suggests reforming the third by tightening allowances for accelerated depreciation ( as several other developed countries have done ) in order to offset some of the revenue losses . But reducing the overall corporate rate would increase after-tax returns on past investments , while limiting accelerated depreciation would lower after-tax returns on new investments . 
Likewise , while limiting the deductibility of net interest for corporations , as many other developed countries have done , would broaden the tax base and discourage excessive reliance on debt financing , it would increase the tax burden on major investments in physical capital , which are often debt-financed . 
Reducing the tax preferences for non-corporate business entities ( such as partnerships ) that pass their income through to their owners &quot; individual returns would also broaden the tax base subject to the corporate-income tax . 
Pass-through companies now account for more than 80 % of net business income ( by far the highest share in the developed countries ) . 
Several of these entities are very large and profitable , and enjoy the same legal benefits as corporations . 
Economic logic suggests that businesses of similar size and engaged in similar activities should not pay different tax rates based solely on their organizational form . 
The fact that a large share of business income is currently taxed as personal income makes it difficult to separate corporate tax reform from personal tax reform , as Obama and members of Congress would prefer to do . 
Moreover , keeping the two areas of reform separate rules out the approach adopted by several other developed countries , which have offset some of the revenue losses from cutting corporate tax rates by increasing taxes on corporate equity income at the personal shareholder level . 
This approach also addresses concerns about the regressive effects of a cut in the corporate rate . 
It is both more progressive and more effective : with highly mobile capital , it is far easier to collect taxes from individual citizens and resident shareholders than from multinational companies . 
According to a recent study , restoring tax rates on dividends and capital gains to their pre-1997 levels of 28 % could finance a reduction in the US federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 26 % . 
This change would both reduce the incentive for corporations to shift investments abroad and increase the progressivity of the US tax system . 
Similarly , a modest carbon tax or value-added tax , with credits or subsidies to offset the regressive effects on low-income households , could generate enough revenue both to pay for a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate and to make a meaningful contribution to deficit reduction . 
There is no inconsistency between a progressive , balanced deficit-reduction plan and lowering the corporate tax rate . 
Of all taxes , corporate taxes are the most harmful to economic growth - without which meaningful deficit reduction is far more difficult to achieve .
