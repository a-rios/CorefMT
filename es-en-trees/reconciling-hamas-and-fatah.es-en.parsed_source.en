Reconciling Hamas and Fatah 
GAZA / JERUSALEM - As representatives of Hamas and Fatah meet for the fourth round of national unity talks in Cairo , not only Palestinians but also Americans and Europeans will be watching closely . 
The top-level talks , hosted by Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman , will be crucial to ending nearly two years of bloody confrontation between Hamas-ruled Gaza and the Fatah-ruled West Bank , governed by Western-backed Mahmoud Abbas . 
Given previous failures , this round of talks might prove to be the final chance to re-establish Palestinian unity . 
The continuing internal schism between the more moderate and secular Fatah and the Islamist Hamas has not only left the Palestinian leadership in disarray , but has also made meaningful peace negotiations with Israel next to impossible . 
Moreover , continued internal disunity continues to thwart reconstruction efforts in Gaza , which are urgently needed in the aftermath of Israel &apos;s military offensive earlier this year . 
Thus , the outcome of the negotiations in Cairo will have repercussions for Palestinians and Israelis - and , indeed , for anyone with a stake in the Middle East peace process . 
In previous rounds , the different factions agreed in principle on forming a united government for the West Bank and Gaza , and on holding legislative and presidential elections in the Palestinian Territories by January 2010 . 
Discussions also center on the control of the security services - a field in which neither Fatah nor Hamas have much room to maneuver . 
Moreover , disagreement prevails on the type of electoral system to be used . 
Whereas Fatah favors a clear majority voting system , Hamas calls for a more personalized approach . 
Furthermore , the question of including Hamas in the Palestine Liberation Organization is crucial . 
Contrary to common perception , the PLO has always been the only official negotiating partner with Israel and does not include Hamas . 
In a rather obscure linguistic debate , Hamas has in previous negotiation rounds refused to &quot; commit &quot; itself to past PLO agreements with Israel , but has instead offered to &quot; respect &quot; them . 
Negotiators in Cairo will thus have to discuss if such an indirect recognition of Israel &apos;s right to exist will be acceptable . 
Underneath this clear-cut quid pro quo of political bargaining , the representatives from Fatah and Hamas are charged with finding the means to reconcile Hamas &apos;s tremendously popular political ideology with Fatah &apos;s traditional secular aspirations . 
This is not merely an internal Palestinian affair , for it reflects a conflict raging across the entire Middle East . 
Until now , no Arab society has managed to harmonize these opposing trends . 
Instead , most governments have opted for a more or less confrontational approach of suppression and exclusion , banning Islamists from participating in elections or bullying them into semi-legality . 
The case of the Palestinian Territories , however , is different . 
In the absence of a strong central authority , the predominant divide between secular nationalism and politicized religion has led to the actual geographic disintegration of the Palestinian Territories into two distinct parts . 
Given the difficulties that even major players in the region face when dealing with the challenge of political Islam , it becomes clear that for the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority , only compromise and dialogue is a feasible way to heal the rift . 
Unsurprisingly , the fate of the Cairo talks is anything but certain . 
Failure to come up with a unified Palestinian position would undoubtedly play into the hands of the newly elected Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu . 
After all , the Israeli Prime Minister has made it clear that he favors continued conflict management in terms of &quot; economic peace &quot; over far-reaching political processes based on mutual respect and cooperation . 
Faced with continued internal division , pressing for a meaningful peace process is very difficult for the Palestinians . 
As a consequence , Israel &apos;s willy-nilly expansion of West Bank settlements might finally bury comprehensive peace efforts for good . 
But success in Cairo might prove even more challenging . 
If the negotiations lead to the establishment of a Palestinian government supported by both Fatah and Hamas , there will be a tough choice to make - not primarily for Palestinians , but first and foremost for Western decision makers . 
Will the West continue its policy of boycotting Hamas politically and financially , or will it adopt an alternative approach ? 
Given Hamas &apos;s belligerent ideology , any change in the West &apos;s approach towards Hamas in the aftermath of successful Palestinian dialogue in Cairo would be difficult .
