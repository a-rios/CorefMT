The Strange Rebirth of American Leadership 
FLORENCE - At the recent annual meetings of the American Economic Association , there was widespread pessimism about the future of the United States . 
&quot; The age of American predominance is over , &quot; declared one economist . 
&quot; The US should brace for social unrest amid blame over who was responsible for squandering global primacy , &quot; said another . 
We have heard this story many times before , not only in the US , but in other places as well . 
George Dangerfield &apos;s controversial history , The Strange Death of Liberal England , describes his country &apos;s sudden decline at the peak of its power at the turn of the last century . 
The world everyone knew simply and inexplicably seemed to disappear . 
Many Americans - think of the Tea Party &apos;s adherents , for example - fear that something similar is happening to their own country . 
Dangerfield based his diagnosis on a cross-section of institutions , politics , and personalities , set against the bitter class warfare of the time . 
Americans , however , have generally been averse to class warfare . 
True , the US has been home to a rigid , albeit comparably fluid , class structure ever since its founding . 
Nearly all Americans , apart from the richest and poorest , define themselves as &quot; middle class . &quot; 
Such remains America &apos;s democratic ethos . 
Still , it is right to ask if the American way of life will survive the twenty-first century , and , if it does , whether it will survive in America or migrate elsewhere as the US economy and political system collapse under the accumulated weight of decades of myopic national leadership and squandered opportunities . 
Indeed , Chinese President Hu Jintao &apos;s recent trip to Washington was seen by many - particularly many Chinese - as the passing of the torch . 
Pessimists have been saying this for a long time . 
Optimists , touting GDP and other indicators , will continue to insist that Americans have never had it so good . 
If there is any continuity worth underscoring , it is the regular cohabitation of boosterism with declinism : America &apos;s glass is always simultaneously half full and half empty . 
It is no coincidence that during the Reagan / Bush years - the last time so assertive a foreign policy coincided with such large deficits - a book like Joseph Nye &apos;s Bound to Lead ( 1990 ) could follow in the footsteps of Paul Kennedy &apos;s The Rise and Fall of Great Powers ( 1988 ) . 
The former made a strong case for the necessity of American global hegemony ; the latter warned of &quot; imperial overstretch . &quot; 
Both authors based their arguments on an assessment of the underlying context - that is , the structure - of world power . 
America was overstretched because its global liabilities were increasingly out of balance with its national assets , and it was bound to lead because the world as we know it is arranged favorably for it to do so . 
Similar arguments have been raised again recently . 
Writers Parag Khanna and Fareed Zakaria have regurgitated those made by Kennedy , Nye , and forebears like Hedley Bull in asserting that the US must lead the world away from a &quot; new medievalism &quot; amid the &quot; rise of the rest &quot; and the relative stagnation of the &quot; West . &quot; 
But are such writers making a valid point ? 
If we look at moments of so-called structural convergence - the 1880 &quot; s , 1920 &quot; s , 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s , and 1990 &quot; s , in particular - we see the sources of American prosperity and power emerged in a global context , only to recede again . 
Perhaps rise and fall is more of a cyclical than a linear phenomenon . 
Or maybe it &apos;s neither . 
The missing variable in most of these arguments , even Nye &apos;s , is leadership . 
Leaders are never bound to rise or fall by circumstances alone . 
Most historians place leadership in the foreground of human history , with structural variables having conditional , not causal , value . 
Beneath even the richest soil , Dangerfield wrote , may lie the most perilous residue of discord and destruction . 
Why have Americans been so good at leading ? 
Are Americans specially blessed , or just lucky ? 
Now that the US has at last begun to move , gradually and thoughtfully , away from the passions that characterized the country &apos;s response to the 2001 terrorist attacks , it is worth asking if Bill Clinton was right to say that America &apos;s virtues and assets always prevail against its vices and defects . 
The writers mentioned above are less interested in the essence of power than in its exercise . 
They would rather have the US become more sophisticated in the ways of the world . 
Khanna , for example - presumably drawing upon the recent writing of Edward Luttwak - urges Americans to learn from the Byzantine Empire in crafting complex and obscure alliances among large and small states and non-state entities , so that diplomacy comes to resemble something like the global derivatives market . 
Americans don &apos;t do this particularly well , however Byzantine their country &apos;s own politics and policy-making may seem . 
The US political system was never designed to rule the world . 
Its checks and balances were meant to frustrate any such mission at the hands of an all-powerful executive , and it is doubtful that Americans would support such activism in perpetuity . 
The secrets of American success are transparent yet difficult to quantify . 
Americans &quot; pragmatism , opportunism , fair-mindedness , inventiveness , adaptability , optimism , and , above all , their inherent competitiveness offset their tendencies toward violence , impatience , self-righteousness , and unpredictability , their fondness for novelty and celebrity for their own sake , and their self-assertion en masse - getting there , as they like to say , &quot; fastest with the mostest . &quot; 
Those who understand Americans &quot; deep-rooted passion for &quot; making it &quot; know why class or any other civil warfare has not succeeded in destroying America from within . 
The American character prefers displacement to destruction , the win-win to the zero-sum . 
That is still true , both at home and abroad .
