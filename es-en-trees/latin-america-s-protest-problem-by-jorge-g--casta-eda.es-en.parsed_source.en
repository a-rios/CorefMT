Disgruntled Democracies 
MEXICO CITY - In 2011 and 2012 , tens of thousands of students demonstrated in Santiago , Chile , demanding greater access to higher education . 
Earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of Brazilians marched in São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro , and Belo Horizonte , calling for improved public-health services , better schools , and cheaper , more efficient public transport . 
And Colombians and Peruvians from all walks of life ( especially peasants , farm owners , and mineworkers ) , as well as Mexican school teachers , now occupy the centers of Bogotá , Lima , and Mexico City , disrupting inhabitants &quot; daily lives and creating serious problems for the authorities . 
These countries , once models of economic hope and democratic promise in Latin America , have become examples of democracies without legitimacy or credibility . 
Although they have made significant social progress in recent years , they have become centers of popular unrest . 
And their presidents , despite their undeniable competence , are watching their approval ratings plummet . 
These paradoxes are both perplexing and revealing . 
For starters , they reflect an economic-growth problem . 
Chile &apos;s economy has performed well over the past two years , despite low world copper prices ; but its annual growth rate is nowhere near that of the previous 25 years . 
The economic balm applied to old social and cultural wounds is losing its effectiveness . 
Similarly , while Brazil &apos;s economy remained relatively resilient after the 2009 recession , growth slowed almost to zero last year . 
Growth rates last year in Colombia and even Peru , which has performed better than any other Latin American country since 2000 , also dropped significantly . 
And Mexico , the worst-performing of the five economies over the last 15 years , has outdone itself ; this year , growth is expected to reach barely 1 % , if that . 
At the same time , while all of these countries built the political and judicial institutions needed to consolidate their transitions to democracy - from Brazil &apos;s in the mid-1980 &quot; s to Mexico &apos;s in 2000 - these institutions have become ( and in some cases always have been ) remarkably insulated from popular demands . 
As a result , the protests took these countries &quot; seemingly responsive presidents by surprise . 
Indeed , Colombia &apos;s Juan Manuel Santos Calderón and Brazil &apos;s Dilma Rousseff - both skilled and experienced politicians - were utterly unprepared for their countries &quot; protests . 
Likewise , Mexico &apos;s Enrique Peña Nieto and Peru &apos;s Ollanta Humala , who have otherwise seemed to be perceptive leaders , failed to sense the gathering storm . 
As the Chilean economist and politician Carlos Ominami put it : &quot; The children of democracy have become the prime movers of change ; the social movement they represent lacks political leadership , and the country &apos;s political forces have practically broken off all their connections to the social world . &quot; 
This year , Chile will hold its sixth consecutive democratic election , with two women - former Labor Minister Evelyn Matthei and former center-left President Michelle Bachelet ( both daughters of high-ranking military officers ) - currently leading in the polls . 
Whoever wins will have to choose between deeply transforming Chile &apos;s institutions and letting social unrest spin out of control . 
Brazil faces a similar trial , as next year &apos;s soccer World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics test the resilience and adaptability of the social and macroeconomic frameworks that have shaped the country &apos;s development for almost two decades . 
To be sure , pro-active anti-poverty programs , loose credit , a commodity-export boom , and heavy government spending ( financed by an equally heavy tax burden ) lifted millions out of poverty . 
But the expectations of the emerging middle class - including efficient infrastructure , high-quality education and health services , and well-paid jobs - have not been met . 
If they cannot even enter the luxurious new stadiums to see their national team play , they will not be happy . 
Similarly , although Mexico has experienced rapid population growth and significant standard-of-living improvements over the last 15 years , many believe that they are not getting what they deserve - or what they were promised . 
Teachers are furious at being blamed for the wretched state of the country &apos;s education system and view Peña Nieto &apos;s &quot; educational reform &quot; law as an excuse to limit the power of their unions while avoiding genuine institutional reform . 
Mexico City &apos;s middle-class residents - who wield disproportionate influence countrywide - are also incensed , both at the teachers for disrupting their lives and at the federal and local authorities for failing to restore order . 
Against this background , the credibility of Mexico &apos;s political institutions is rapidly eroding . 
But there is a more fundamental issue at play that stems from the accumulated imperfections of representative democracy in countries where social and economic conditions are less than ideal . 
When post-authoritarian excitement abounded and rapid economic growth prevailed , these imperfections were manageable ; now , with the former fading and the latter a memory , they have become immense challenges . 
This problem transcends Latin America . 
As observers like Joshua Kurlantzick have pointed out , a global shift away from representative government , driven by increasingly disillusioned middle classes , is underway . 
For elected leaders , the dilemma is that there are no simple solutions - and little public patience for more complex ones .
