Sustainable Convictions 
WASHINGTON , DC - Achieving a more sustainable world presupposes a worldview that considers well-being not only in terms of income , but also in terms of human security and opportunities for every person to thrive . 
It is worth considering what the world would look like from such a perspective . 
For starters , it would be a world in which people live free from conflict over land , water , and space , and that ensures food security for the 739 million people who are hungry or malnourished today . 
Such a world would preserve the 20,000 species of animals and plants that face extinction , understanding their power to heal us physically and spiritually . 
It would draw us back from the brink of unstoppable global warming and its consequences for coastal communities , weather patterns , and , in some regions , habitability . 
It would protect sites of extraordinary natural beauty and inspiration . 
And , for future generations , it would be a world that is more sustainable than ours . 
Many people consider this idealistic . 
But economic growth enables people to improve their lives . 
It alters the political economy of decision-making , creating space for new ideas to thrive . 
And one of those ideas is that growth is unsustainable in the long run unless it is inclusive and green . 
We need to break the myth that greener growth is more costly . 
Smart policy can help us to overcome short-run constraints , deeply entrenched behaviors , and social norms , and to develop innovative financing instruments that change incentives . 
A recent report by the World Bank makes the case for cleaner , greener , and more inclusive growth models . 
At the same time , the Equator Principles offer companies a framework for considering the environmental and social risks of their investments . 
Similarly , we need to use more comprehensive wealth accounts as a reference point for decision-making . 
Countries have long used national income accounts , with GDP as the main indicator , to describe economic performance . 
A more accurate portrait of the wealth of nations must account not only for income , but also for natural and social assets . 
Such indicators would enable decision makers to consider the longer-term impact of behavior that might deplete or build assets and impede or establish a more sustainable pattern of development . 
New tools such as Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystems , or WAVES , enable increasingly robust ecosystem accounting - an approach endorsed by 62 countries , more than 90 private companies , and 17 civil-society and international organizations at the Rio + 20 summit in June . 
We must also protect our oceans , which are the source of 16 % of the global population &apos;s animal protein intake . 
Only a small fraction of species that live in oceans have been discovered and documented . 
The potential value of ocean life for medicine , the economy , and our climate is unknown . 
Yet ocean bio-systems are under threat from acidification , pollution , and over-exploitation . 
Where oceans meet the shore , degradation of mangroves and grasslands jeopardizes our coastal communities . 
With less than 1 % of ocean space protected , and only a small fraction affected by well-considered government policies or international treaties , opportunities abound to improve the oceans &quot; health . 
The Global Partnership for Oceans is a promising new alliance of more than 100 government and international institutions , civil-society organizations , and private companies seeking to address threats to ocean health , resilience , and productivity . 
Likewise , we must recognize that the sky is ( at ) the limit . 
After the Kyoto Protocol was agreed , world leaders hoped to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level . 
They recognized the dramatic implications that even this amount of warming would have for sea levels , freshwater supplies , agriculture , extreme weather events , public health , and the planet &apos;s flora and fauna . 
We now appear to be on track for four-degree warming , with almost unimaginable consequences . 
The need for concerted action to limit greenhouse-gas emissions is beyond doubt . 
While the politics of international agreements plays out , we need to take action now . 
More thoughtful urban planning , more efficient transport systems , better management of forests , agricultural techniques that help to sequester carbon , cleaner and more affordable energy , and appropriate pricing of dirty fuels can all move us in the right direction . 
Climate Funds such as the Climate Investment Fund , the Global Environment Facility , and the recently created Green Climate Fund deserve support as major vehicles for developing workable solutions . 
Above all , we must use goals to focus policy . 
The United Nations Millennium Development Goals set ambitious targets for lowering poverty , improving health and nutrition , expanding education , increasing gender equality , and ensuring environmental sustainability . 
Those targets have served as a useful rallying call . 
As the global community develops Sustainable Development Goals to complement the MDGs , we need a robust public debate on the lessons learned and the financing mechanisms used to meet the targets . 
Once we set goals , we need reliable information systems to assess progress toward achieving them . 
The information needed to understand social , environmental , and economic trends is generally produced by government statistics offices . 
But , even as the urgency of being able to understand trends and act in real time is increasing , many governments face significant gaps in their ability to produce and analyze information . 
Massive investments will be needed to strengthen governments &quot; capacity to collect timely , relevant , and high-quality data ; to analyze information ; and to present it to policymakers in ways that allow them to grasp and tackle the major challenges to sustainability . 
&quot; Think globally , act locally &quot; has long been a useful rallying call for the health of the planet . 
But the magnitude of the problems that we face also compels us to act globally . 
New tools for economic modeling , natural-wealth accounting , and investment decision-making can move us forward . 
Action now to build smarter cities and protect oceans , air , and forests will shape the trajectory of our changing climate . 
As the agreements reached at Rio + 20 are implemented , the global community should resolve to take even bolder action in the next 20 years - at the local , national , and international levels - to foster sustainability .
