The Age of Violence 
PARIS - Global problems are rarely straightforward . 
But , in general , careful analysis of their various facets leads to some understanding of their causes and , in turn , to reasonably promising solutions . 
Indeed , the opportunity to analyze such problems regularly is precisely what makes my role as a columnist so gratifying . 
Lately , however , promising solutions have been increasingly elusive . 
Simply put , much of the world is mired in conflict , with little hope of escape . 
In Ukraine , violent clashes between pro-Russian separatists and the police are just the latest development in the country &apos;s deteriorating security situation . 
Syria remains locked in a brutal civil war . 
And tensions between Israel and Iran over the latter &apos;s nuclear program - not to mention Israel &apos;s decades-old conflict with Palestine - are exacerbating instability in the Middle East , where ten countries , taken together , have become the world &apos;s largest market for weapons , purchasing more new arms annually than China . 
Several African countries - Mali , Central African Republic , South Sudan , and Somalia - are engulfed in permanent civil war , leaving citizens without potable water , much less schools , hospitals , and other social infrastructure . 
In Nigeria , the Islamic militia Boko Haram - a glorified gang of criminals - brings disgrace on the Prophet , in the name of whom they abducted more than 200 schoolgirls to sell or use as sex slaves . 
In Asia , China &apos;s military buildup and increasingly assertive approach in pursuing its territorial claims in the South and East China seas - which overlap with claims by Japan , the Philippines , South Korea , and Vietnam - is raising concerns among its regional neighbors . 
It does not help that China &apos;s economic growth , which provided a powerful boost to the region &apos;s smaller economies in recent decades , has slowed considerably . 
China is not the only major emerging economy experiencing diminished growth . 
Brazil , too , is suffering from slow growth , not to mention stubborn inflation and mounting deficits . 
Meanwhile , Latin American countries like Mexico and Colombia remain under threat from drug cartels that sometimes are better armed than the police or the military . 
Meanwhile , in the European Union , an election has come to a close . 
But it was an election for nothing ; the outcome merely reinforced the growing divide between pro-Europeans and Euro-skeptic populist parties . 
While the global economy may seem to be recovering from the recent crises , it remains fraught with risk , stemming from the $ 750 trillion in liquidity - up $ 50 trillion since 2006 - sloshing around in speculative markets . 
This capital does not finance investments or fuel economic growth ; its sole purpose is to reap enormous but unpredictable profits for a select few . 
This bubble , like all bubbles , will burst , triggering a much more severe crisis than that of 2008 . 
At least event organizers are keeping busy . 
The United Nations is preparing its 21st climate conference , to be held in Paris in 2015 , with world leaders knowing full well that it , too , will end in failure to conclude a comprehensive global agreement . 
Given the scale of the world &apos;s ecological challenges , our leaders &quot; incapacity to cooperate effectively on the environment could not be more problematic . 
For example , at the current rate , the world &apos;s fish resources will be extinguished in the next half-century . 
Yet Russia , Ukraine , and China recently opposed the establishment of Protected Marine Areas , which are critical to the survival of numerous species . 
We have only one planet , and we must learn to coexist on it . 
Yet the overwhelming feeling is one of chaos and degradation . 
We cannot afford to wait for world leaders to solve our problems any longer . 
The global public must unite to compel decision-makers to take real action aimed at overcoming obstacles to peace , harmony , and sustainability . 
The first obstacle is international law &apos;s lack of enforcement authority . 
While respecting individual countries &quot; sovereignty is vital , so is accountability - and that requires some international authority to monitor and punish crimes . 
The good news is that the global public is increasingly supportive of international intervention in some cases . 
But it must go further , demanding that any treaty should include a provision for surveillance and sanctions ; that a country &apos;s right to veto intervention be limited according to the amount of time that has passed and the issue at stake ; and that measures to protect populations be decided upon by majority vote . 
The second major obstacle is the intellectual demise of what could be called &quot; the science of economics . &quot; 
Nowadays , the banking industry shapes decision-making worldwide , exemplified in its enduring right to unlimited speculation and its capacity to capture profits that are unmatched by any other industry , especially for its senior managers , while exposing the world to overwhelming risk . 
Instead of allowing a single self-interested sector to dictate the economy &apos;s functioning , policymakers must determine precisely what the acceptable balance is between risky speculative activities and financial stability - and ensure that the financial sector adheres to it . 
Governments &quot; emphasis should always be on reducing unemployment , instability , and inequality . 
The third major obstacle to global peace and prosperity is the disappearance of ethics from the functioning of states and markets . 
Governments and multilateral bodies like the UN have gradually been discredited , along with the value systems on which they are based . 
While major religions retain some value-based authority , most have remained largely silent on the real political , economic , environmental , and security challenges that the world faces . 
Why do Christian churches continue to focus on people &apos;s private behaviors and not on the rules of the social and economic game ? 
Why does the Chief Rabbinate of Israel never discuss peace , much less make a statement on what , in the eyes of God , should have priority : a piece of land or millions of human lives ? 
Why do Muslim authorities so rarely condemn crimes supposedly committed in the name of the Prophet ? 
Perhaps that will change , too . 
Pope Francis , for example , appears to be leading the Catholic Church in the direction of greater social engagement . 
It is the global public &apos;s duty to take the same route .
