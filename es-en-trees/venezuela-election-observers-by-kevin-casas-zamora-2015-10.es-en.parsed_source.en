Venezuela &apos;s Questionable Election Observers 
WASHINGTON , DC - The congressional elections to be held in Venezuela in December offer a flicker of hope to a country facing dark prospects . 
Provided they are carried out correctly , they offer an institutional channel to manage the country &apos;s deep political polarization and growing popular discontent . 
Given the near certainty that the opposition to President Nicol√°s Maduro &apos;s Chavista regime will , at the very least , make important gains , the result could open the way for negotiations capable of correcting Venezuela &apos;s self-destructive path . 
That will not be possible , however , unless the elections are transparent and credible . 
In Venezuela &apos;s volatile political climate , ensuring a fair process will require the presence of reputable international election observers - something that , so far , Maduro has refused to allow . 
According to the 2005 Declaration of Principles of International Election Observations , credible monitoring requires that five criteria be met . 
First , the observers must be autonomous - financially and otherwise - in their relationship to the host country . 
Second , observers must be granted unrestricted access to all aspects and phases of the election process , as well as to all of the technologies involved . 
Third , observers must face no restrictions in meeting with all authorities and political actors . 
Fourth , observers must not be subject to any pressure or threat of retaliation by any government authority . 
And , fifth , observers must be free to issue public statements and reports with their findings and recommendations . 
These principles have been ratified by the United Nations , the African Union , the Organization of American States ( OAS ) , the European Union , the Carter Center , and a long list of highly respected organizations involved in the promotion of democracy . 
Conspicuously absent from the list of signatories is the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) - the only international body that Venezuelan authorities have invited to monitor the December election . 
Sadly , Venezuela has a long tradition of cherry-picking its election observers . 
Neither the OAS nor the EU has been invited to observe elections in Venezuela since 2006 . 
The Carter Center , which issued politely worded but unmistakably critical reports after the 2012 and 2013 elections , did not receive an invitation this time around , despite its long association with the country and former US President Jimmy Carter &apos;s past praise of its vote-counting technology . 
Relying exclusively on UNASUR for election observations is deeply problematic , even if one overlooks some of its heterodox norms and practices , such as the absence of an explicit ban on receiving funding or deploying observers from host countries . 
What is far more worrying is that the organization has accepted the questionable preconditions imposed by Venezuela &apos;s authorities . 
The rules that UNASUR has agreed to uphold are so peculiar that the entire exercise is not even called election observation ; it is called , tellingly , an &quot; election accompaniment . &quot; 
Under the current law , the movements and monitoring activities of UNASUR &apos;s observers are subject to a plan previously approved by the authorities . 
The observers are to request explicit approval for any visit , interview , or meeting to be carried out at the office of any electoral authority . 
The organization is also obliged to abstain from making public statements of any kind until after the results are announced , and to keep all comments and suggestions they make to electoral authorities - including their final report - strictly confidential . 
Not surprisingly , the Venezuelan opposition - which lost the last presidential contest by one percentage point - has little confidence that UNASUR &apos;s involvement will ensure a credible election . 
Nor is it surprising that opposition leaders have called for the presence of observers from the OAS , by far the most experienced body in the Western Hemisphere when it comes to election monitoring . 
OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro has repeatedly offered to field an electoral mission , only to be indignantly rebuffed by Maduro . 
It is unfortunate that neighboring countries like Brazil , Uruguay , Argentina , and Chile - all of which consistently hold high-quality elections - are not making more of an effort to ensure that Venezuela &apos;s upcoming vote is free and fair . 
Recent polls show Maduro losing his parliamentary majority . 
If , instead , he wins by a slim margin , his victory , in the absence of trustworthy observers , will have no credibility . 
Given the potential for serious political unrest , such an outcome poses a danger to all parties involved .
