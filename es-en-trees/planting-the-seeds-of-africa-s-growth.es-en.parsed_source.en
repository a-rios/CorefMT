Planting the Seeds of Africa &apos;s Growth 
WEST LAFAYETTE , INDIANA - After decades of bad news , at least three major trends are turning Africa &apos;s way : agricultural policies , rural demography , and farm productivity all promise improved opportunities for farm families across the continent . 
These trends move too slowly to make headlines , but cumulatively they offer a whole new world of bigger payoffs from public and private investment in agriculture and rural development . 
Each country in every year faces a unique set of circumstances . 
Novelties get the most attention , like the possibility that outside investors might control large areas of farmland . 
Spatial diversity is also important , because it ensures that each place differs from the aggregate average . 
For Africa as a whole , however , at least three slow trends have recent turning points that offer game-changing new incentives for entrepreneurs and governments . 
The first turning point is political . 
New data from a World Bank study that compares farm policies around the world since 1955 shows for the first time just how far today &apos;s African governments have gone to reduce the cost to farmers of the export taxes , marketing boards , and other interventions imposed by previous regimes ( www.worldbank.org / agdistortions ) . 
Africa &apos;s policy-induced price distortions peaked in the late 1970 &quot; s , and reforms since then have removed about two-thirds of that burden , greatly facilitating productivity growth and poverty alleviation . 
Further reforms could yield additional benefits , but much of the handicap imposed on African farmers by post-colonial governments has now been removed . 
The second transition is demographic . 
Census data compiled in recent revisions of United Nations population projections reveal the slowly unfolding implications of African history . 
African households obtained access to modern medicine much later and more suddenly than people in other regions . 
The resulting improvement in child survival rates and population growth during the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s were faster than those seen earlier in Asia or Latin America . 
Africa &apos;s towns and cities have been growing at some of the world &apos;s fastest rates , but their absolute size is so small that they can absorb only a fraction of all new workers . 
Consequently , Africa &apos;s rural population has been growing faster and for longer than any other in human history , with a correspondingly rapid and prolonged decline in per-capita endowments of land and other natural resources . 
Moreover , post-independence improvements in child survival triggered a rise in child dependency rates , which also reached historically unprecedented levels in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s . 
Africa &apos;s demographic burdens began to lighten in the 1990 &quot; s , thanks to gradual reduction in fertility rates and continued urbanization . 
As seen earlier in Asia , the slowdown in rural population growth and the reduced burden of childcare creates a window of opportunity for new investment to bring larger year-on-year increases in output per capita . 
The third turning point in this sequence is technological : national estimates of cereal crop productivity show how , after decades of stagnation during the Asian green revolution , African yields have grown steadily over the past decade , so that estimated cereal grain output per capita now equals that of South Asia . 
The start of this turnaround could be associated with the other two trends , as the cumulative result of more favorable policies and increased labor per hectare , but it could also reflect the gradual spread of improved crop varieties that resulted from earlier investment in agricultural technology . 
The inflow of foreign aid to boost agricultural production did not rise until after the world food crisis of the 1970 &quot; s , and it peaked in the late 1980 &quot; s , yielding payoffs some years later . 
Taken together , African politics , demography , and the delayed arrival of new technologies imposed severe headwinds against per-capita growth of agricultural output in the last quarter of the twentieth century . 
But , looking forward , as these headwinds fade , faster growth and poverty alleviation are becoming easier to achieve . 
Of course there is no guarantee of further progress . 
The engines of growth include public and private investment , particularly for the new technologies needed to raise farm productivity . 
Past efforts have been victims of their own success : as the burst of worldwide agricultural research and development in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s led to global food abundance in the 1990 &quot; s and 2000 &quot; s , foreign-aid donors turned to other priorities , and their per-capita support for African agriculture fell to a historical low in 2006 of around one dollar per year . 
The global food crisis of 2007-2008 brought a brutal end to that complacency , and many investors have pledged a renewed focus on agriculture , but the proof will be in the spending . 
African agriculture continues to face serious challenges . 
Soil nutrients are being depleted , soil moisture is falling , temperatures are rising , and disease pressures are worsening . 
Fortunately , a growing arsenal of solutions is available through local innovations that are increasingly well adapted to Africa &apos;s unique needs . 
Generalizations and predictions rarely survive for long on a continent as diverse and volatile as Africa is . 
But African countries do have some things in common : widespread improvements in farm policy , improved demographic conditions , and the availability of new technologies create new opportunities for the decade ahead . 
These three mega-trends put African farmers in a better position than ever before to take advantage of increased public and private investment . 
As the obstacles created by previous government policies and past population growth are gradually removed , adopting successful innovations will yield increasingly large payoffs and faster per-capita growth over time . 
For investors , the deepest obstacles are informational : what works best , and under which circumstances ? 
New data sources about relative impacts are becoming available , and are desperately needed . 
Governments , donors , and other investors can still make bad choices , but there are unprecedented opportunities for high-payoff growth . 
If funders take notice , farmers are poised to respond - and 2010 could mark the start of a bright new era in African agriculture .
