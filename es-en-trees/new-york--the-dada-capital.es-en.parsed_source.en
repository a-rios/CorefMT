New York , the Dada Capital 
I am looking down on Central Park and recall from half-a-century ago in a small town in Northern Romania a tall , white-haired man proclaiming his poem , &quot; The Colors Red and Black . &quot; Gazing over the park , I remember those Stalinist era verses : 
In New York , everything is beautiful . 
Heroes come , heroes go . 
Children , born for Sing-Sing , 
cover the streets like pellagra 
Yellow karate-blood 
pulses through each building . 
In the harbor the Statue of Liberty ! 
Behind her elevated falsehood 
Yankee ghosts howl at the moon 
tormented as if from pellagra 
by the colors red and black . 
The red of the Revolution , of course , and the black of the oppressed race . 
Cliché was the common currency of all Communist dictatorships , but they had the opposite effect to what the regime intended , for they cast an aura of forbidden fruit around the slandered New World metropolis , making it seem a glowing Olympus of modernity , an urban Everest of adventure . 
The few trips I was allowed to take as a citizen of Socialist Romania did , of course , have moments of rapture for me , novice that I was . 
Yet New York remained a dream , so foreign and distant that I never imagined I would have the chance to compare illusion with reality . 
My eventual escape to New York had nothing to do with tourism . 
Sudden terror before this omnipresent , all-devouring monster was soon overtaken by fascination . 
The critic Irving Howe , a New Yorker of long standing , tried to temper my enthusiasm . 
&quot; To enjoy this city you need a good apartment and a certain salary . &quot; 
I was living in a miserable hotel in a rundown neighborhood , consumed with a newcomer &apos;s neurotic insecurity . 
That Walt Whitman and Mark Twain , Herman Melville , Henry James , and John Dos Passos had lived here , that Enescu , Brancusi , or Eugen Ionesco had been successful here in no way raised my hopes . 
Life in and with this city was as hypnotic as a drug . 
Over the last seventeen years this addiction was established through daily negotiations with life &apos;s routine . 
New York &apos;s metabolism filled me with its energy and its toxins . 
Although I felt that I , an exile in the land of exiles , belonged ever more to a world to which no one can really be said to belong , on September 11 , 2001 , I was finally able to proclaim , &quot; I am a New Yorker , &quot; just as President Kennedy had declared himself a Berliner when that former National Socialist capital was in danger of becoming a Communist capital . 
The Old Testament tells how work on the tower in Shinar , in ancient Babylon , was disrupted because man aspired to reach the heavens and divinity . 
Suddenly the builders could no longer understand each other . 
Different languages divided them . 
In present-day Babylon in Chinatown , in Little Italy , in Russian Brighton Beach , and in the alleys and byways of New York , all the world &apos;s languages are spoken . 
The builders of the twin towers , whatever their native tongues , wanted to be Americans , citizens of the New World , the towers they built symbolizing the stature of freedom . 
The attack on the towers of Babel was unexpected but not unpredictable in so far as it represented the hatred of Allah &apos;s fanatical followers for the symbols of modernity . 
In the World Trade Center , human creativity and collaboration were universally codified . 
Of course , the building lacked poetry . 
Yet , the towers could have been a symbol of worldwide poetry , not commerce . 
As the Surrealist poet André Breton said , &quot; It is above all our differences that unite us . &quot; 
Surprisingly , for such an extensive , cynically efficient cluster of humanity , the city displayed surprising civility and solidarity during and after the attacks . 
It immediately regained its strength , its sense of humor , and its industriousness . 
After September 11 , 2001 , skyscrapers , clubs , and restaurants of all kinds sprang up like mushrooms , with almost more vitality than before . 
Moreover , the city refused to give its votes to a president who exploited its disaster for political gain . 
Romania is often called the Land of Dada , not because one of its sons , Tristan Tzara , was a founder of Surrealism , but because of the absurdity and paradoxes of its daily life , particularly in its politics . 
In exile , I immediately identified with another capital of Dada , the &quot; cosmic republic , that speaks all languages in a universal dialect , &quot; as Johannes Baader put it . 
Here , the old and the new are accomplices in celebrating life &quot; in all its incomprehensibility &quot; - exactly the subversiveness that the Dadaists loved . 
A famous map painted by my friend and compatriot Saul Steinberg depicts the global village as seen from Manhattan : the distance from the Hudson River to the Pacific Ocean is the same as the distance from Ninth to Tenth Avenue on the Upper West Side , and somewhere beyond the calm ocean float Russia , China , and Japan . 
Saul &apos;s other maps evoke his past : Milan , the city of his youth , Zurich , where Dada got its explosive start , and the Romanian city Buzau , where he was born . 
A map of my own fate would encompass Bukovina as my native land , the Transdnistrian concentration camp of my childhood , the Communist labor camp Periprava where my father &apos;s identity was altered , the Bucharest of my student years and my adulthood , Berlin , my exile &apos;s starting point , and finally New York , where my exile found its residence . 
This fate is its own &quot; Babel , &quot; a confused mixture of memories and places . 
Here on the Upper West Side , in the middle of a triangle formed by Central Park , Lincoln Center , and the Hudson River , I was once in the habit of beginning each day with an exotic act of devotion , a ritual of humility . 
I now had a good apartment and a certain salary , so Irving Howe &apos;s conditions for life in the city were fulfilled . 
From my window , I watched the Rubbish Gangster : shaven head , bull neck , and swollen nose , from which dangled mucus-incrusted strands of hair , his short arms bursting with criminal power . 
Every day , at the same hour , he appeared with his metal trunk stuffed with all that he had collected from street corner garbage cans ; it was as if he wanted to ensnare me with his street sorcery so that I could see the city &apos;s unfathomable contrasts . 
The writer , caught up in the shelter of solitude , does not have much time to wander about . 
His neighborhood is his world , the geography of his calendar . 
Luckily , the streets of New York offer extraordinary spectacles wherever one is . 
In the Bronx or in Soho , in Washington Square or Times Square , in front of the New York Public Library or near a hot dog stand , across all the planets &quot; races , the banal vies with the exceptional for one &apos;s attention . 
All faces , ages , and events , sooner or later , can be found here . 
Routine increases banality and thoughtlessness ; the personal disappears . 
You pursue your business here as only New Yorkers can , but every once in a while you look up and wonder , &quot; How did I get here ? &quot; 
I often look at New York &apos;s architecture as if looking at an art book . 
On my way home from Bard College , where I teach , I am greeted by the George Washington Bridge majestically suspended over the Hudson River . 
It is a glorious welcome , even in fog . 
The same is true of the skyline . 
Approach the city and you see the urban center of the world - a hard and harried place , marked by social contrasts as dizzying as its skyscrapers and with a sense of transience as elevated as its buildings . 
Its workforce labors round the clock and its inventiveness , energy , and diversity counter provincialism with scorn . 
Like America itself , although so utterly different , New York can only be comprehended &quot; synthetically . &quot; 
This festively incoherent capital of Dada is a spectacular fusion of freedom and pragmatism . 
Misery and magnificence , seduction and neurosis create and recreate the dynamic , unmistakable spectrum of New York life . 
In this city you learn to limit yourself . 
It is impossible to take in at once all of the innumerable symphonic or jazz concerts , or parades celebrating ethnic or sexual minorities . 
You can &apos;t attend all the lectures , panel discussions , and auctions where everyday dramas and dreams are bartered . 
You can &apos;t sit in all the taxis driven by those loquacious ambassadors from India and Russia and Haiti , from Pakistan and Ghana and Guatemala . 
At best you can grab a mere crumb of this frenetic global kaleidoscope . 
In the end , in New York you own nothing more than the instant , the now , the right now . 
Again I look over Central Park . 
&quot; Dada covers things with an artificial tenderness , &quot; wrote Tzara . 
&quot; It is snowing butterflies that have escaped from a prophet &apos;s head . &quot;
