Pre-Judging Paris 
COPENHAGEN - The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris later this month is being billed as an opportunity to save the planet . 
It is no such thing . 
As I show in a new peer-reviewed paper , even if successful , the agreement reached in Paris would cut temperatures in 2100 by just 0.05 ° Celsius . 
The rise in sea level would be reduced by only 1.3 centimeters . 
This may seem surprising : we constantly hear how every country has made important commitments to reduce CO2 emissions - the so-called &quot; Intended Nationally Determined Contributions , &quot; or INDCs . 
According to the UN &apos;s climate chief , Christiana Figueres , &quot; the INDCs have the capability of limiting the forecast temperature rise to around 2.7ºC by 2100 , by no means enough but a lot lower than the estimated four , five , or more degrees of warming projected by many prior . &quot; 
Figueres suggested that the Paris agreement will cut almost 2 ° C of warming , from 4.5 ° C to 2.7 ° C. Though her wording was crafted to avoid actually saying this , it was , predictably , what most people heard . 
But the reduction consists almost entirely of made-up numbers and wishful thinking . 
The expected rise of 4.5 ° C is based on almost 10,000 gigatons ( Gt , or billion tons ) of CO2 emitted during this century , with all other greenhouse gasses converted to CO2 equivalents . 
But nobody actually believes this figure - even the UN Environment Programme estimates that with absolutely no climate policies , we would emit 7,750Gt , which might lead to a 3.8 ° C rise . 
So , the extra 0.7 ° C rise is simply made up : climate policies can &apos;t take credit for reducing it , because it was never going to happen in the first place . 
Keeping temperature rises to 2.7 ° C will require the world to restrict emissions to about 4,700Gt . 
So , in order to live up to Figueres &quot; promise , we should expect Paris to cut about 3,000Gt . 
It will not . 
Figueres &apos;s own organization estimates that the total reduction promised from 2016 to 2030 will amount to 29-33Gt , or 1 % of what is needed to get to 2.7 ° C. Achieving the other 99 % is based on the aspiration that , while little will happen from 2016-2030 , right after that countries will step up and begin dramatic emissions cuts . 
Recent history renders this implausible . 
Back in 1997 , when the world signed the Kyoto Protocol , almost everyone expected that it would be just the first step toward deep emissions reductions . 
Yet the cuts envisioned in Paris by 2030 are just one-third higher than what was promised in Kyoto . 
And the Kyoto treaty , which required no action from developing counties , was repeatedly renegotiated to the point where it didn &apos;t require any cuts at all . 
The United States dropped out , and Canada , Russia and Japan eventually abandoned it as well . 
Just 12 years later , great expectations were met with utter failure at the 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen . 
It is only slightly less far-fetched to hope that countries won &apos;t just live up to their Paris promises in 2030 , but will extend these cuts throughout the twenty-first century . 
After all , that is certainly not what governments are offering . 
The US , for example , clearly says that its &quot; target is for a single year : 2025 . &quot; 
We could even assume that countries trying to cut their emissions won &apos;t just move energy-intensive production to other countries . 
( Under the Kyoto Protocol , about 40 % of emissions leaked this way , with the EU &apos;s entire reduction circumvented through higher imports just from China . ) 
And we could believe that every single country will fulfill every single promise . 
Yet , even with these heroic assumptions , the total temperature reduction would be a very modest 0.17 ° C. A simple model of sea-level rise reveals that we would avoid perhaps 2.6cm. 
And , though more than 500Gt of emissions would be cut , we would still be 2,500Gt short of Figueres &apos;s promise . 
Many environmental campaigners are outraged by my scientific analysis showing how little Paris will matter . 
Their anger is surprising , because the math is simple : we &apos;re hoping for 3,000Gt but only committing to 30Gt , and history strongly suggests that even those promises are unlikely to be met . 
But , along with much of the climate-policy establishment , campaigners have invested two decades in pushing for the Kyoto-Copenhagen-Paris process that has so far delivered so little . 
Wishful thinking , it seems , is easier than acknowledging the flaws in their approach . 
Just as we saw in Kyoto , many argue that countries will go far beyond their promises in coming decades . 
The US has suggested it might cut emissions by 80 % by 2050 . 
Yet the average of all the top energy-economic models suggest that such a cut would cost more than one trillion present-day dollars annually , with realistic annual costs approaching $ 2.5 trillion . 
Similarly , the EU has vowed to cut at least 80 % by 2050 ; but , again , the average cost estimated by seven models runs to € 3-6 trillion annually - possibly almost a quarter of Europe &apos;s GDP . 
Such costs indicate that , given current technological expectations , the proposed reductions are merely wishful thinking . 
Much has been made of China &apos;s promise to reach peak emissions around 2030 . 
I did not include this promise in my calculations , because for now it is mostly political grandstanding , being at least 15-20 years away from having any real-world impact . 
I did include China &apos;s promise to cut about 2Gt by 2030 , which will cost about $ 200 billion annually . 
Models indicate that reaching peak emissions in 2030 could end up costing China about 500 billion to one trillion present-day dollars every year by 2050 . 
With the EU and the US unlikely to inflict economic self-harm to achieve their hand-waving targets after 2030 , it strains credibility to expect China to do so . 
Nonetheless , China &apos;s peak is not the holy grail , as it will reduce emissions only about 300Gt , or a little less than 0.1 ° C , by the end of the century . 
Our approach to climate change is broken . 
The Paris agreement will likely cost the world at least a trillion dollars each year , yet deliver only a tiny reduction in temperature by the end of the century . 
We should accept that trying to make fossil fuels too expensive to use will never work . 
Instead , we should make green energy so cheap that nobody can resist it .
