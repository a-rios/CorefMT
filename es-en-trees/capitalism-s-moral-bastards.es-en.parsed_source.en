Capitalism &apos;s Moral Bastards 
Recent revelations that many corporate executives have backdated their stock options , ensuring excessive compensation even when their companies perform poorly , are merely the latest in a stream of examples of bad business behavior . 
In an era of evaporated pensions and benefits for the rank and file , piggish pay packets for CEO &apos;s have led a cynical public to wonder where big business has gone wrong . 
The answer may be quite simple : too many bosses have abandoned basic human values and embraced the credo famously uttered by Gordon Gekko in the movie Wall Street : &quot; Greed is good . &quot; 
But a growing body of research concludes that greed is not always good , and that moral values are a necessary element in the conduct of business . 
The Gordon Gekkos are predators who take the quick payoff . 
Although they do serve a useful purpose by keeping other players on their toes and raising efficiency through competition , market participants for the most part avoid them , preferring to do business with the Warren Buffetts - hard-driving businessmen , but known for fair play and creating long-term value . 
Consider the trip to the mall , where shoppers buy goods produced and shipped from around the world . 
This decentralized delivery of goods relies on employees working for two weeks before receiving a paycheck , companies offering each other lines of credit , and banks offering bridge loans . 
Even though humans have engaged in exchange since before the birth of civilization , the impersonal system of trading is only around 1,000 years old . 
While legal remedies exist should this system break down , impersonal trading cannot occur unless most people share the values of fair play and reciprocal cooperation . 
Even in impersonal market exchange , we cannot help but personalize transactions , say , with the grocery store cashier who smiles and thanks us , or the store greeter whose only purpose is to make us feel cared for . 
This personalization draws upon regions of the brain that evolved when our trading partners were members of small kin-based groups where moral violations were immediately identified and remedied . 
Research by primatologists Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal at Emory University has shown that monkeys also have what look like moral values . 
When two monkeys work for food , a fair split is expected . 
If a fair division is not received , it elicits cries of outrage and hurled food by the wronged partner . 
Moral values have powerful physiological representations in humans , too , and we feel them strongly when they are violated . 
The philosopher Josh Greene and his colleagues at Princeton University have shown that personal moral dilemmas ( for example , whether you would directly kill one person to save seven others ) use our emotions rather than higher cognition - to the chagrin of many philosophers who claimed otherwise . 
The personal aspect of such decisions makes our hearts speed up and our palms sweat . 
In neuroeconomics experiments that my lab has conducted , we have found that when a stranger places trust in another by making a considered monetary investment that can either be returned or stolen , our brains release an ancient mammalian hormone called oxytocin . 
Oxytocin is what bonds mammals to their offspring , and in humans makes spouses care about and love each other . 
We have found that trust causes a spike in oxytocin and begets reciprocation - the sharing of money . 
We are &quot; wired &quot; to cooperate , and we find it rewarding in the same way that our brains identify eating a good meal or sex as rewarding . 
Oxytocin is active in evolutionarily old areas of our brain , outside of our conscious awareness . 
We simply have a sense that sharing with someone who has trusted us is the right thing to do . 
We have also found that about 2 % of undergraduates we studied are pure non-cooperators . 
When they have an opportunity to share money with a stranger who has trusted him or her , non-cooperators keep all the money rather than share the largess . 
The technical term in my lab for these people is &quot; bastards . &quot; 
Our evidence suggests that bastards &quot; brains work differently . 
Their character traits are similar to those of sociopaths . 
They simply do not care about others the way most people do , and the dysfunctional processing of oxytocin in their brains appears to be one reason for this . 
Because bastards are out there , we still need government and personal enforcement of economic exchange . 
Nevertheless , too much government regulation may &quot; crowd out &quot; moral behavior . 
When every offense has an associated penalty , transgressions cease to be moral violations , but are simply a way for wrongdoers to effectively &quot; use the system &quot; while facing some risk of getting caught and paying a fine . 
These external penalties can displace the internal sanctions we feel when we do wrong . 
At Enron , this was accomplished by breaking down tasks into small chunks so that no one person was ultimately responsible for a decision and could claim ignorance when caught . 
Former Enron chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling excused his behavior at his trial by saying , &quot; I &apos;m not an accountant . &quot; 
Many people have been convinced that market exchange diminishes our humanity . 
Think of Charlie Chaplin &apos;s film Modern Times , in which the little tramp is literally a cog in the capitalist machine . 
That view , a residue of Marxist thinking , is wrong . 
On the contrary , working together , and trading with each other in markets , is morality in action .
