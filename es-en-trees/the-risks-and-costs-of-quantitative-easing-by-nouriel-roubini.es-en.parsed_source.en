Ten QE Questions 
NEW YORK - Most observers regard unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing ( QE ) as necessary to jump-start growth in today &apos;s anemic economies . 
But questions about the effectiveness and risks of QE have begun to multiply as well . 
In particular , ten potential costs associated with such policies merit attention . 
First , while a purely &quot; Austrian &quot; response ( that is , austerity ) to bursting asset and credit bubbles may lead to a depression , QE policies that postpone the necessary private- and public-sector deleveraging for too long may create an army of zombies : zombie financial institutions , zombie households and firms , and , in the end , zombie governments . 
So , somewhere between the Austrian and Keynesian extremes , QE needs to be phased out over time . 
Second , repeated QE may become ineffective over time as the channels of transmission to real economic activity become clogged . 
The bond channel doesn &apos;t work when bond yields are already low ; and the credit channel doesn &apos;t work when banks hoard liquidity and velocity collapses . 
Indeed , those who can borrow ( high-grade firms and prime households ) don &apos;t want or need to , while those who need to - highly leveraged firms and non-prime households - can &apos;t , owing to the credit crunch . 
Moreover , the stock-market channel leading to asset reflation following QE works only in the short run if growth fails to recover . 
And the reduction in real interest rates via a rise in expected inflation when open-ended QE is implemented risks eventually stoking inflation expectations . 
Third , the foreign-exchange channel of QE transmission - the currency weakening implied by monetary easing - is ineffective if several major central banks pursue QE at the same time . 
When that happens , QE becomes a zero-sum game , because not all currencies can fall , and not all trade balances can improve , simultaneously . 
The outcome , then , is &quot; QE wars &quot; as proxies for &quot; currency wars . &quot; 
Fourth , QE in advanced economies leads to excessive capital flows to emerging markets , which face a difficult policy challenge . 
Sterilized foreign-exchange intervention keeps domestic interest rates high and feeds the inflows . 
But unsterilized intervention and / or reducing domestic interest rates creates excessive liquidity that can feed domestic inflation and / or asset and credit bubbles . 
At the same time , forgoing intervention and allowing the currency to appreciate erodes external competitiveness , leading to dangerous external deficits . 
Yet imposing capital controls on inflows is difficult and sometimes leaky . 
Macroprudential controls on credit growth are useful , but sometimes ineffective in stopping asset bubbles when low interest rates continue to underpin generous liquidity conditions . 
Fifth , persistent QE can lead to asset bubbles both where it is implemented and in countries where it spills over . 
Such bubbles can occur in equity markets , housing markets ( Hong Kong , Singapore ) , commodity markets , bond markets ( with talk of a bubble increasing in the United States , Germany , the United Kingdom , and Japan ) , and credit markets ( where spreads in some emerging markets , and on high-yield and high-grade corporate debt , are narrowing excessively ) . 
Although QE may be justified by weak economic and growth fundamentals , keeping rates too low for too long can eventually feed such bubbles . 
That is what happened in 2000-2006 , when the US Federal Reserve aggressively cut the federal funds rate to 1 % during the 2001 recession and subsequent weak recovery and then kept rates down , thus fueling credit / housing / subprime bubbles . 
Sixth , QE can create moral-hazard problems by weakening governments &quot; incentive to pursue needed economic reforms . 
It may also delay needed fiscal austerity if large deficits are monetized , and , by keeping rates too low , prevent the market from imposing discipline . 
Seventh , exiting QE is tricky . 
If exit occurs too slowly and too late , inflation and / or asset / credit bubbles could result . 
Also , if exit occurs by selling the long-term assets purchased during QE , a sharp increase in interest rates might choke off recovery , resulting in large financial losses for holders of long-term bonds . 
And , if the exit occurs via a rise in the interest rate on excess reserves ( to sterilize the effect of a base-money overhang on credit growth ) , the ensuing losses for central banks &quot; balance sheets could be significant . 
Eighth , an extended period of negative real interest rates implies a redistribution of income and wealth from creditors and savers toward debtors and borrowers . 
Of all the forms of adjustment that can lead to deleveraging ( growth , savings , orderly debt restructuring , or taxation of wealth ) , debt monetization ( and eventually higher inflation ) is the least democratic , and it seriously damages savers and creditors , including pensioners and pension funds . 
Ninth , QE and other unconventional monetary policies can have serious unintended consequences . 
Eventually , excessive inflation may erupt , or credit growth may slow , rather than accelerate , if banks - faced with very low net interest-rate margins - decide that risk relative to reward is insufficient . 
Finally , there is a risk of losing sight of any road back to conventional monetary policies . 
Indeed , some countries are ditching their inflation-targeting regime and moving into uncharted territory , where there may be no anchor for price expectations . 
The US has moved from QE1 to QE2 and now to QE3 , which is potentially unlimited and linked to an unemployment target . 
Officials are now actively discussing the merit of negative policy rates . 
And policymakers have moved to a risky credit-easing policy as QE &apos;s effectiveness has waned . 
In short , policies are becoming more unconventional , not less , with little clarity about short-term effects , unintended consequences , and long-term impacts . 
To be sure , QE and other unconventional monetary policies do have important short-term benefits . 
But if such policies remain in place for too long , their side effects could be severe - and the longer-term costs very high .
