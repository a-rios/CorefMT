Rationality versus Intelligence 
TORONTO - In 2002 , the cognitive scientist Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University won the Nobel Prize in Economics for work done with his longtime collaborator Amos Tversky ( who died in 1996 ) . 
Their work had to do with judgment and decision-making - what makes our thoughts and actions rational or irrational . 
They explored how people make choices and assess probabilities , and uncovered basic errors that are typical in decision-making . 
The thinking errors they uncovered are not trivial mistakes in a parlor game . 
To be rational means to adopt appropriate goals , take the appropriate action given one &apos;s goals and beliefs , and hold beliefs that are commensurate with available evidence . 
It means achieving one &apos;s life goals using the best means possible . 
To violate the thinking rules examined by Kahneman and Tversky thus has the practical consequence that we are less satisfied with our lives than we might be . 
Research conducted in my own laboratory has indicated that there are systematic individual differences in the judgment and decision-making skills that Kahneman and Tversky studied . 
Ironically , the Nobel Prize was awarded for studies of cognitive characteristics that are entirely missing from the most well-known mental assessment device in the behavioral sciences : intelligence tests . 
Scientists and laypeople alike tend to agree that &quot; good thinking &quot; encompasses sound judgment and decision-making - the type of thinking that helps us achieve our goals . 
Yet assessments of such good ( rational ) thinking are nowhere to be found on IQ tests . 
Intelligence tests measure important things , but they do not assess the extent of rational thought . 
This might not be such a grave omission if intelligence were a strong predictor of rational thinking . 
But my research group found just the opposite : it is a mild predictor at best , and some rational thinking skills are totally dissociated from intelligence . 
To an important degree , intelligence tests determine the academic and professional careers of millions of people in many countries . 
Children are given intelligence tests to determine eligibility for admission to school programs for the gifted . 
Corporations and the military depend on assessment and sorting devices that are little more than disguised intelligence tests . 
Perhaps some of this attention to intelligence is necessary , but what is not warranted is the tendency to ignore cognitive capacities that are at least equally important : the capacities that sustain rational thought and action . 
Critics of intelligence tests have long pointed out that the tests ignore important parts of mental life , mainly non-cognitive domains such as socio-emotional abilities , empathy , and interpersonal skills . 
But intelligence tests are also radically incomplete as measures of cognitive functioning , which is evident from the simple fact that many people display a systematic inability to think or behave rationally despite having a more than adequate IQ . 
For a variety of reasons , we have come to overvalue the kinds of thinking skills that intelligence tests measure and undervalue other important cognitive skills , such as the ability to think rationally . 
Psychologists have studied the major classes of thinking errors that make people less than rational . 
They have studied people &apos;s tendencies to show incoherent probability assessments ; to be overconfident in knowledge judgments ; to ignore the alternative hypothesis ; to evaluate evidence with a &quot; my side &quot; bias ; to show inconsistent preferences because of framing effects ; to over-weigh short-term rewards at the expense of long-term well-being ; to allow decisions to be affected by irrelevant context ; and many others . 
All of these categories of failure of rational judgment and decision-making are very imperfectly correlated with intelligence - meaning that IQ tests tend not to capture individual differences in rational thought . 
Intelligence tests measure mental skills that have been studied for a long time , whereas psychologists have only recently had the tools to measure the tendencies toward rational and irrational thinking . 
Nevertheless , recent progress in the cognitive science of rational thought suggests that nothing - save for money - would stop us from constructing an &quot; RQ &quot; test . 
Such a test might prove highly useful . 
Suboptimal investment decisions have , for example , been linked to overconfidence in knowledge judgments , the tendency to over-explain chance events , and the tendency to substitute affective valence for thought . 
Errors in medical and legal decision-making have also been linked to specific irrational thinking tendencies that psychologists have studied . 
There are strategies and environmental fixes for the thinking errors that occur in all of these domains . 
But it is important to realize that these thinking errors are more related to rationality than intelligence . 
They would be reduced if schools , businesses , and government focused on the parts of cognition that intelligence tests miss . 
Instead , these institutions still devote far more attention and resources to intelligence than to teaching people how to think in order to reach their goals . 
It is as if intelligence has become totemic in our culture . 
But what we should really be pursuing is development of the reasoning strategies that could substantially increase human well-being .
