My Best Investment 
JAKARTA - When I was boy , I dreamed of becoming a doctor . 
I was born in Indonesia in the early 1950 &quot; s , a time when most families in my country lacked access to health care . 
But revolutionary breakthroughs in medicine were starting to turn the tide on these killers , and Indonesia &apos;s doctors were celebrated as heroes . 
I wanted to be a hero , too , so I studied hard and enrolled in medical school . 
My plans changed , however , when my father got ill . 
He was a hard-working man who made pedicabs in Surabaya , and I left university when he could no longer manage the family business . 
Ultimately , I became a successful entrepreneur and established a bank that is now one of Southeast Asia &apos;s largest financial institutions . 
Looking back , I have no regrets . 
Indeed , I know that I have been incredibly blessed . 
Millions of children in developing countries in Africa , Asia , and the Western Pacific are forced into extreme poverty when a parent gets sick or dies . 
And millions more suffer from diseases that prevent them from leading a healthy and productive life . 
That is why I have decided to invest $ 65 million in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria . 
When the Global Fund was created a decade ago , HIV incidence was rising around the world , and the drugs used to treat the virus were still prohibitively expensive . 
Malaria was killing one million people each year , with mortality concentrated among pregnant women and children under the age of five . 
More than two million people were dying from tuberculosis , because they lacked access to low-cost , first-line treatment . 
Since then , the Global Fund has played a key role in reversing the course of these epidemics . 
Worldwide , HIV incidence has fallen by one-third , and the cost of HIV drugs has dropped more than 99 % . 
The number of African households that sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets has risen from 3 % to 53 % , and malaria deaths have fallen by one-third . 
Altogether , support provided by the Global Fund has saved more than nine million lives - a remarkable achievement . 
But the impact of the Global Fund extends far beyond lives saved . 
When an HIV-positive mother receives antenatal treatment so that her child can be born HIV-free , we change the future . 
When a child is spared cerebral malaria and the lifelong mental disabilities that it can cause , new possibilities are created . 
The world becomes a better place when we commit to giving our children a better start . 
The Global Fund also plays a critical role in strengthening health care in developing countries . 
Its resources have helped to train new generations of doctors , nurses , and technicians , while dramatically improving the overall quality of maternal and child health . 
These investments are helping countries take direct ownership of the fight against infectious disease , ultimately reducing their dependence on foreign aid . 
For example , support from the Global Fund has helped Indonesia , which has the world &apos;s fourth-highest TB burden , develop an efficient and effective national TB-control program . 
As a result , more than one million active cases have been successfully treated , while the incidence of the disease - which has cost Indonesia &apos;s economy millions of dollars in lost productivity - has been driven down . 
With technical support like this , Indonesia &apos;s government is creating an affordable and sustainable national health-care system that will be fully financed with domestic resources by 2019 . 
I believe that the Global Fund is one of the smartest investments that we can make - as many governments have understood from the outset . 
The United States has been the Global Fund &apos;s largest supporter , but many others have done their part . 
For example , Australia has provided US $ 410 million to the Global Fund since 2002 , an amount that has enabled nearly 200,000 people to receive lifesaving HIV treatment , 80,000 people to receive TB treatment , seven million people to be cured of malaria , and 14 million bed nets to be delivered to families in need . 
The Global Fund has brightened the futures of hundreds of thousands of children across Africa and Asia - a heroic achievement that should make donor countries &quot; citizens proud . 
I hope that others with the means to support its work will invest so wisely .
