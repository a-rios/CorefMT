Brazil &apos;s Oil Rush 
SÃO PAULO - Brazil is poised to take its place among the world &apos;s petro-powers . 
Estimates of its newfound oil reserves place it in eighth place among oil-producing nations , ahead of Nigeria as well as Brazil &apos;s rival for influence in Latin America , Venezuela . 
Such newfound wealth is normally a source of celebration . 
But Brazil &apos;s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , perhaps fearing the infamous &quot; resource curse &quot; that has blighted the development of so many countries blessed with mineral wealth , is determined that the new oil wealth not be turned into &quot; nonsense . &quot; 
In 2007 , huge oil deposits were discovered off Brazil &apos;s coast . 
Modest estimates put these reserves at around 30 billion barrels . 
Crédit Suisse and other investment banks say that 50 billion barrels are available . 
The discovery is the result of a strategic policy maintained through successive Brazilian administrations , something unusual in Latin America . 
In 1989 , when the Iraq-Iran war sent shivers among oil-consuming nations , Brazil began to explore for energy both within and beyond its 200-nautical-mile protected zone . 
The size of the oceanic areas involved was enormous , thus earning the term &quot; Blue Amazonia . &quot; 
The discoveries are the largest oil reserves discovered in the ocean in recent years . 
For a while , the US tried to question Brazil &apos;s ownership by trying to force a discussion of the &quot; internationalization &quot; of the oceans and their mineral resources . 
Lula &apos;s government has thought long and hard about how to manage the oil wealth , and has devised a unique program . 
First of all , it wants to spread the wealth by pursuing a new model of regional integration through energy and infrastructure . 
It is planning to create a fund , backed 70 % by Brazilian financial resources , that will be dedicated to projects such as rehabilitating roads in Uruguay and Paraguay in order to enhance its neighbors &quot; capacities and correct economic imbalances . 
Balanced economic development - national and regional - is essential for Brazil . 
Indeed , Lula &apos;s government is planning ways to ensure that the benefits gained from oil and gas are not limited to São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro , Minas Gerais , Parana , and other regions of the developed coast . 
It thinks it is essential to locate refineries , industries , and additional energy-generating units in parts of the country that are both suited for such development and in need of it . 
An additional benefit of dispersing these productive resources will be greater interaction with Brazil &apos;s South American partners . 
Brazil &apos;s new oil reserves will certainly affect regional geo-politics . 
Mexico &apos;s oil fields are diminishing , which means that it may need to look for external supplies . 
Tensions in the Middle East , and growing rivalry between the US and Venezuela , will make Brazil an attractive supplier . 
Brazil is already testing its appeal as an energy power through the actions of its powerful state energy company , Petrobras , which is now as active in Africa as it is in Argentina . 
Indeed , Petrobras is now producing 100,000 barrels a day in both Angola and Nigeria , with the oil marketed locally . 
But the discoveries place Brazil at a crossroads . 
Oil revenues can be controlled by the state to be used , in part , for social programs , as in Venezuela . 
Or private capital can be granted a bigger say , and trust placed in the market to provide for society . 
This ongoing debate has impeded decisions on the future of deep wells in Blue Amazonia . 
Lula &apos;s administration has even thought about creating a new national oil company to deal only with the new fields . 
But this idea has created confusion among Brazil &apos;s trading partners and investors , and does not appear to be making headway . 
There is an even more complex question . 
Brazilian growth will soon to rest on the shoulders of a product that is the main source of global warming . 
Indeed , Brazil &apos;s embrace of an oil-fired future reverses its longstanding policy of reliance on bio-fuels . 
So Brazil is on a collision course with the future . 
The size of the new oil reserves adds even more weight to Brazil &apos;s growing global influence . 
But it will no longer be able to condemn the US for not signing environmental treaties , or point a finger at China for its massive output of pollution . 
Much less will Brazil be able to demand from its neighbors a commitment to sustainable development . 
Oil , it seems , will not only transform Brazil &apos;s economy , but its very role in the world .
