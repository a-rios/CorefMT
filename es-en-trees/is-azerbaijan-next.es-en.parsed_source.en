Is Azerbaijan Next ? 
As Azerbaijan gears up for parliamentary elections on November 6 , the main question is whether the country is about to undergo its own &quot; color &quot; revolution , along the lines of those that have overthrown post-Soviet elites in Georgia , Ukraine , and Kyrgyzstan in the last two years . 
Such an outcome cannot be ruled out , but the prospects are uncertain at best . 
Azerbaijan &apos;s ruling party , Eni Azerbaijan , faces challenges all around , despite the support of President Ilham Aliyev and privileged access to state resources . 
At least three opposition parties - Isa Gambar &apos;s &quot; Mussavat , &quot; Ala Keremela &apos;s &quot; The National Front , and the Social Democratic Party - have maintained support and political influence since Ilham succeeded his late father , Heydar Aliyev , in 2003 . 
Moreover , like Georgia , Ukraine , and Kyrgyzstan , dynastic politics in Azerbaijan reflects the dominance of clans whose members &quot; success is determined by proximity to the president . 
While such systems may appear stable , they are inherently fragile , for they are synonymous with lawlessness , injustice , and abject poverty for the majority of the population . 
The opposition has already started preparing the ground for change . 
The leaders of the three-party opposition bloc Azadlyg ( Freedom ) have declared that they will regard any electoral outcome that gives opposition parties less than 70 % of the vote as having been falsified , and that street protests would follow . 
But can such a scheme work in Azerbaijan ? 
A &quot; dress rehearsal &quot; failed in October 2003 , when the opposition , incapable of uniting around a single candidate to challenge Ilham in the presidential election , declared the results to have been falsified and called people into the streets . 
Only several hundred showed up , and the police quickly dispersed them , arresting dozens . 
This time , the opposition is united , having found it far easier to agree on mutual support for 125 parliamentary candidates than to settle on a single presidential candidate . 
In Tbilisi , Kiev , and Bishkek , the leaders of the &quot; color revolutions &quot; had already held lofty positions in regimes that they now attacked as thoroughly corrupt ; yet they succeeded in gaining the population &apos;s trust . 
That is far from a foregone conclusion in Azerbaijan , where the last stint in power by some of the opposition leaders in 1992-1993 still evokes bitter memories of a time of war and crisis that few can recall without horror . 
Most importantly , however , the previous &quot; color revolutions &quot; underscore the crucial role of world public opinion and the global mass media that shape it . 
As in Georgia , Ukraine , and Kyrgyzstan , the fate of the regime and the country may well hang on whether the current government is portrayed on the world &apos;s television screens as a violator of human rights that is thwarting the will of the people and thus rejecting &quot; generally accepted democratic values . &quot; 
Such an image may be less valid in Azerbaijan . 
After coming to power in 1993 , Heydar Aliyev stopped the war with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave , secured Azerbaijan &apos;s existence as a sovereign state , and , as the oil-and-gas sector flourished , oversaw the country &apos;s growing international authority . 
The transfer of power from father to son took place peacefully , and Ilham &apos;s administration has presided over completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline - to the annoyance of Russia and Armenia . 
At the same time , high oil prices have enabled higher social spending and infrastructure investment . 
Today , the capital , Baku , resembles a huge construction site , with high-rise housing , stores , and roads being built at a breakneck pace - and apparently benefiting the broad strata of the population . 
But none of this may ultimately matter if the West ­ - and the United States , in particular - decides that Ilham &apos;s regime is not ensuring its interests and seeks to manipulate the global media image accordingly . 
The West &apos;s main interest is not Azerbaijan &apos;s oil reserves , which accounted for just 0.06 % of the world &apos;s total in 2004 , but its geopolitical position at the crossroads of global energy and transport corridors and as a frontline state vis-à-vis an increasingly assertive Iran . 
So far , it appears as though the West will back Ilham over the opposition . 
Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , the president of the European Parliamentary Assembly , Rene Van der Linden , and US Deputy Secretary of State for global affairs Paula Dopryansky have all visited Baku recently . 
As US foreign-policy doyen Zbigniew Brzezinski put it in an interview with a German radio station , &quot; The majority of Azeris actually support President Ilham Aliyev . 
Therefore , we have a situation that differs from those that took place in Georgia , Ukraine , and Kyrgyzstan . &quot; 
Nevertheless , the West appears to be hedging its bets by sustaining contacts with the opposition . 
As Brzezinski added , &quot; Of course , it is important for the political regime in Azerbaijan to be as stable and legitimate as possible . &quot; 
If the West decides that the government has become unreliable , television shots of demonstrators &quot; weekly clashes with the Baku police , Ilham &apos;s refusal to hold televised debates , and the confiscation of all orange objects from stores will come in handy . 
Of course , modern technology alone cannot bring about a revolution . 
Azerbaijan is no exception , and Russia , having been burned by its naked intervention on behalf of the governments in Georgia and Ukraine , has given every indication that it intends to sit this one out . 
The government appears confident that high oil prices , administrative resources , and dominance of the local media will ensure an election victory . 
That may not be enough .
