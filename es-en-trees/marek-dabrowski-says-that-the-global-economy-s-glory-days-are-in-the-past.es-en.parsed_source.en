The World Economy &apos;s Impossible Demand 
WARSAW - The global economy &apos;s glory days are surely over . 
Yet policymakers continue to focus on short-term demand management in the hope of resurrecting the heady growth rates enjoyed before the 2008-09 financial crisis . 
This is a mistake . 
When one analyzes the neo-classical growth factors - labor , capital , and total factor productivity - it is doubtful whether stimulating demand can be sustainable over the longer term , or even serve as an effective short-term policy . 
Consider each of those growth factors . 
Over the next 15 years , demographic changes will reverse , or at least slow , labor-supply growth everywhere except Africa , the Middle East , and South Central Asia . 
Europe , Japan , the United States , and eventually China and East Asia will face labor shortages . 
Although large-scale migration from labor-surplus regions to deficit regions would benefit recipient economies , it would almost certainly trigger popular resistance , especially in Europe and East Asia , making it difficult to support . 
Increasing the labor-force participation rate , especially among women and the elderly , might ease tight labor markets , but this alone would be insufficient to counter the decline in working-age populations . 
The world economy cannot count on higher investment levels either . 
The global investment / GDP ratio , especially in advanced economies , has been gradually declining over the past 30 years , and there is no obvious reason why it would pick up again in the medium to long-term . 
Until recently , falling investment in the developed world had been offset by rapid increases in investment in emerging markets , mostly in Asia . 
But high rates of investment there are also unsustainable . 
As in Japan , China &apos;s investment rate ( running at almost 50 % of GDP since 2009 ) will decline as its per capita income rises . 
The third engine of growth , total factor productivity , will also be unable to maintain the relentless gains witnessed from the late 1990 &quot; s to the mid-2000 &quot; s . 
During this time , the global economy benefited from the confluence of several unique developments : an information and communications revolution ; a &quot; peace dividend &quot; resulting from the end of the Cold War ; and the implementation of market reforms in many former communist and other developing economies . 
Moreover , global growth received a further boost from the completion of the Uruguay Round of free-trade negotiations in 1994 and the overall liberalization of capital flows . 
It is difficult to point to any growth impetus of similar magnitude - whether innovation or public policy - in today &apos;s economy . 
No new technological revolution appears to be on the horizon . 
The World Trade Organization produced only a limited agreement in Bali in December , despite 12 years of negotiations , while numerous bilateral and regional free-trade agreements might even reduce world trade overall . 
Worse , in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , sluggish growth and high unemployment in developed countries have fueled demands for more protectionism . 
Thus , the financial liberalization of the 1990 &quot; s and early 2000 &quot; s is also under threat . 
The far-reaching macroeconomic and political reforms of the post-Cold War era also seem to have run their course . 
The easy gains have already been banked ; any further structural change will take longer to agree and be tougher to implement . 
Thus , with supply-side factors no longer driving global growth , we must reassess our expectations of what monetary and fiscal policies can achieve . 
If actual growth is already close to potential growth , then continuing the current fiscal and monetary stimulus will only create more bubbles , exacerbate sovereign-debt problems , and , by reducing the pool of global savings available to finance private investment , undercut long-term growth prospects . 
Instead , policymakers should focus on removing their economies &quot; structural and institutional bottlenecks . 
In advanced markets , these stem largely from a declining and aging population , labor-market rigidities , an unaffordable welfare state , high and distorting taxes , and government indebtedness . 
The list of growth obstacles in emerging markets is even longer : corruption and weak rule of law , state capture , organized crime , poor infrastructure , an unskilled workforce , limited access to finance , and too much state ownership . 
In addition , markets of all sizes and levels of development continue to suffer from protectionism , restrictions on foreign capital flows , rising economic populism , and profligate or poorly targeted welfare programs . 
If these problems can be addressed , both globally and at the national level , we can end the dangerous fiscal and monetary expansionism on which the world economy has come to rely and allow growth to be sustained over the long term - though at lower rates than in recent years .
