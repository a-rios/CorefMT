China &apos;s Latest Five-Year Plan 
CAMBRIDGE - I was in Beijing last month when the Chinese government released a preliminary summary of its 13th Five-Year Plan . 
This is an important document for understanding where China is headed in the 2016-2020 period . 
And yet China &apos;s five-year plans just aren &apos;t what they used to be . 
The Chinese economy is no longer the state-owned and state-managed system that it was when I first visited more than 30 years ago . 
In those days , there was no private enterprise , and it was illegal for anyone but the government or a state-owned enterprise to hire an employee . 
Today , only 20 % of employees in China work for SOEs . 
The rest of the Chinese economy is dynamic , decentralized , and privately owned . 
American multinational companies and other foreign firms are an important part of the economic scene . 
So the five-year plan is no longer a detailed blueprint for industrial expansion ; rather , it provides a picture of what the Chinese leadership hopes will be achieved under the government &apos;s general guidance . 
The aim is to improve the overall standard of living - achieving moderately strong growth , raising the share of consumption in GDP , and improving air and water quality - through a combination of Western-style monetary and fiscal policies , state-financed infrastructure development , and changes in environmental and other regulations . 
One of the key goals was set back in 2010 : doubling real GDP and real personal incomes by 2020 . 
The government now officially estimates that achieving this target will require average annual GDP growth of 6.5 % over the next five years . 
Given that China is still a relatively poor country , with per capita GDP only about 25 % of the level in the United States , maintaining such a rapid pace of growth certainly is not impossible . 
But many observers are skeptical about China &apos;s official GDP data and dubious of its ability to sustain 6.5 % growth . 
That skepticism reflects a variety of recent news indicating weak output in parts of the Chinese economy - for example , headlines about reduced industrial production , declines in manufacturing exports , and shutdowns in particular industries . 
Although I cannot claim to be an expert on Chinese economic statistics , I think these headlines are a natural but misleading consequence of the authorities &quot; intentional effort to shift China &apos;s economic structure away from industrial expansion and exports toward greater reliance on services and household consumption . 
Chinese economic experts say that the output of the service sector is growing fast enough to offset growth in industrial output of 5 % or even less , thereby achieving the current overall growth rate of about 7 % . 
But even if annual growth really is now at about 7 % , achieving a 6.5 % rate for the next five years will be a challenge , for at least four reasons . 
For starters , China &apos;s shift from heavy industry to services implies less output per worker and less control by the central government . 
At the same time , the environmental policies that are urgently needed to improve air and water quality absorb resources and impede growth . 
And President Xi Jinping &apos;s crackdown on corruption has had the side effect of delaying decision-making and inhibiting new projects . 
Finally , and perhaps most important , the population of working-age individuals is no longer growing , a result of the 35-year-long policy of restricting most families to no more than one child . 
Although the government recently replaced the one-child limit with a two-child limit , it will be nearly two decades before that change can increase the size of the working-age population . 
Until then , increasing the growth rate of the effective labor force requires shifting workers from low-productivity employment in agriculture to the urban labor force . 
The Chinese government is therefore considering several policies to increase the pace of urbanization , including the creation of several new large cities to accommodate some of the 600 million individuals who still live in rural China . 
Similarly , the government will phase out the hukou system of residency permits that now prevents migrants to the cities from obtaining full health care and education benefits . 
A third policy change aimed at promoting urbanization will be to allow Chinese farmers to sell their land rights at realistic market prices , thereby increasing their incentive to cash out and move . 
And the introduction of a Western-style rental market will allow families without substantial cash or parental support to move to cities ( where families currently must purchase their apartments ) . 
Not all of these policies have to succeed in order to keep the urban labor force expanding in the next five years . 
China also has a variety of short-run problems . 
There is excess capacity in some heavy industries and in residential real-estate markets in some second- and third-tier cities . 
Local governments have significant debts that were incurred at the request of the central government in 2007 and 2008 in order to avoid a serious economic downturn . 
And there is a large volume of bad loans in some state-owned banks and in the shadow banking system . 
Fortunately , the authorities recognize these problems and have strategies - and , more important , the resources - to deal with them . 
China &apos;s economy will not grow as strongly over the next five years as it did in past decades . 
But if the goals set out in the 13th Five-Year Plan are realized , the Chinese people can look forward to a period of rising consumer spending and an improving standard of living .
