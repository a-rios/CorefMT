Escaping George Bush &apos;s Future 
It always comes back to oil . 
The continuing misguided interventions in the Middle East by the United States and the United Kingdom have their roots deep in the Arabian sand . 
Ever since Winston Churchill led the conversion of Britain &apos;s navy from coal to oil at the start of the last century , the Western powers have meddled incessantly in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries to keep the oil flowing , toppling governments and taking sides in wars in the supposed &quot; great game &quot; of energy resources . 
Just when one is lulled into thinking that something other than oil is at the root of current US and UK action in Iraq , reality pulls us back . 
Indeed , President Bush recently invited journalists to imagine the world 50 years from now . 
He did not have in mind the future of science and technology , or a global population of nine billion , or the challenges of climate change and biodiversity . 
Instead , he wanted to know whether Islamic radicals would control the world &apos;s oil . 
Whatever we are worrying about in 50 years , this will surely be near the bottom of the list . 
Even if it were closer to the top , overthrowing Saddam Hussein to ensure oil supplies in 50 years ranks as the least plausible of strategies . 
Yet we know from a range of evidence that this is what was on Bush &apos;s mind when his government shifted its focus from the search for Osama bin Laden to fighting a war in Iraq . 
The overthrow of Saddam was the longstanding pet idea of the neoconservative Project for a New American Century , which was already arguing in the 1990 &quot; s that Saddam was likely to achieve a stranglehold over &quot; a significant proportion of the world &apos;s oil supplies . &quot; 
Vice President Dick Cheney reiterated these fears in the run-up to the Iraq War , claiming that Saddam Hussein was building a massive arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to &quot; take control of a great portion of the world &apos;s energy supplies . &quot; 
Cheney &apos;s facts were obviously wrong , but so was his logic . 
Dictators like Saddam make their living by selling their oil , not by holding it in the ground . 
Perhaps , though , Saddam was too eager to sell oil concessions to French , Russian , and Italian companies rather than British and US companies . 
In any event , the war in Iraq will not protect the world &apos;s energy supplies in 50 years . 
If anything , the war will threaten those supplies by stoking the very radicalism it claims to be fighting . 
Genuine energy security will come not by invading and occupying the Middle East , or by attempting to impose pliant governments in the region , but by recognizing certain deeper truths about global energy . 
First , energy strategy must satisfy three objectives : low cost , diverse supply , and drastically reduced carbon dioxide emissions . 
Important energy technologies will include conversion of coal to liquids ( such as gasoline ) , use of tar sands and oil shale , and growth in non-fossil-fuel energy sources . 
Indeed , there is excellent potential for low-cost solar power , zero-emitting coal-based technologies , and safe and reliable nuclear power . 
Solar radiation equals roughly 10,000 times our current energy use . 
We tap that solar power in many fundamental ways - food production , wind power , hydroelectric power , solar heating , solar-thermal electricity , solar panels - but the possibilities for greatly increased use of inexpensive , widely available , and environmentally friendly solar power are huge . 
Coal , like solar energy , is widely available . 
It is already inexpensive , but it is a solid rather than a liquid , a major pollutant , and a source of greenhouse gas emissions . 
Yet all of these problems can be solved , especially if we make the needed investments in research and development . 
Gasification of coal allows for the removal of dangerous pollutants , and coal can already be converted to gasoline at low cost ; a South African company is beginning to bring that technology to China on a large scale . 
Nuclear power , both fission-based and fusion-based , is yet another possibility for vast , reliable , secure , and environmentally safe primary energy . 
Here , too , there are technological obstacles , but they seem surmountable . 
Of course , there are also major political , regulatory , and security considerations , all of which need to be addressed properly . 
It is ironic that an administration fixated on the risks of Middle East oil has chosen to spend hundreds of billions - potentially trillions - of dollars to pursue unsuccessful military approaches to problems that can and should be solved at vastly lower cost , through R D , regulation , and market incentives . 
The biggest energy crisis of all , it seems , involves the misdirected energy of a US foreign policy built on war rather than scientific discovery and technological progress .
