Shades of Gray 
It takes a very close look at the results of the recent elections in the German state of North-Rhine-Westphalia to find among the list of &quot; Others &quot; the tally for &quot; The Greys &quot; : they got 0.1 % of the vote . 
In other words , one in a thousand voted for them , although they claimed to speak for that state &apos;s retired and elderly people - over 30 % of the population . 
&quot; Generation consciousness , &quot; unlike the &quot; class consciousness &quot; of old , is obviously not a defining factor in people &apos;s political preferences . 
Many more &quot; Greys &quot; voted for the Greens than for their &quot; own &quot; party . 
This is an important fact . 
Most Europeans - and many in other parts of the world - live in rapidly aging societies . 
Nurseries and schools are closed while retirement homes and hospices spring up everywhere . 
Rising life expectancy coupled with low birth rates shape the demography of almost all prosperous countries . 
By the middle of the century - unless there is a dramatic turnaround - about half the population will be economically inactive for reasons of age . 
This trend will have many consequences , most obviously for the welfare state , notably pensions and healthcare . 
While expenditure for both is rising rapidly , the offsetting revenues are coming from ever fewer people in employment . 
As a result , the &quot; generational contract &quot; looks less and less viable , because we can no longer rely on today &apos;s workers to pay for today &apos;s pensioners . 
Insurance-based systems of entitlements created by personal contributions are increasingly taking the place of national health and pension services . 
This is a profound change that creates much friction in the transitional phase . 
For example , the transitional phase is a period in which public debt inevitably increases . 
Governments must continue to pay benefits to today &apos;s pensioners , and they can do so only by borrowing money to replace the revenues that tomorrow &apos;s pensioners are now diverting to personal insurance schemes . 
Debt , however , is a burden imposed by current citizens on future generations . 
Understandably , there are signs that younger politicians of all parties are resisting this development . 
Indeed , a party of the young might well have better prospects than the &quot; Greys . &quot; 
Shifting political interests are , however , but one part of the changes in an aging society . 
More visible are changes in lifestyle . 
People who live longer while not being in employment want to enjoy their lives . 
A plethora of magazines tell pensioners what they can do . 
Advice ranges from sex in old age to tourism . 
Tourism , in particular - cruises as well as more adventurous trips - has become a favorite pastime for the elderly . 
At the same time , images of life in our own societies are shifting . 
No one is surprised to see grey-haired people dancing and singing and petting . 
For many of them , life seems to become an almost permanent holiday . 
To be sure , the impression is deceptive . 
Old people who have families are often found in a new role as educators of the young . 
While their sons and daughters go to work , they become the real parents of the next generation . 
Today &apos;s young children often see more of their grandmother than of their mother . 
One may well wonder what this means in terms of social values . 
The impression of a generation on permanent holiday is deceptive in another respect . 
Much public debate is devoted to child poverty and how to relieve it . 
However , there is at least as much old-age poverty . 
The point is that it is less visible . 
Occasionally , newspapers report that an old person has been found dead after days , having suffered a lonely demise from illness or even starvation . 
For the most part , old-age poverty is hidden , often by the victims themselves , who are too proud to talk about their condition . 
This is in part the explanation for the failure of the &quot; Greys , &quot; that is , of political groups catering to the interests of the elderly . 
While such interests do exist , they do not lead older people to close ranks and organize themselves . 
If they are poor or otherwise disadvantaged , they are most likely to regard this as their personal , almost private destiny . 
Like the unemployed , they do not want a political party devoted to their plight . 
Beyond that , the key feature of an aging society is the independence of the elderly . 
Their vote is precisely not an expression of group interest . 
They make up their own minds and contribute to the unpredictability of modern elections . 
In that sense , too , an aging society adds to the responsibilities of the young .
