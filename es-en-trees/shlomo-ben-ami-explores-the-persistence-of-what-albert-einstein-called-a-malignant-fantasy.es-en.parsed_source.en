The Post-National Mirage 
MADRID - The German philosopher Jürgen Habermas once defined our times as &quot; the age of post-national identity . &quot; 
Try convincing Russian President Vladimir Putin of that . 
Indeed , the great paradox of the current era of globalization is that the quest for homogeneity has been accompanied by a longing for ethnic and religious roots . 
What Albert Einstein considered a &quot; malignant fantasy &quot; remains a potent force even in united Europe , where regional nationalism and xenophobic nativism have not come close to disappearing . 
In the Balkan wars of the 1990 &quot; s , communities that had shared the same landscapes for centuries , and individuals who grew up together and went to the same schools , fought one another ferociously . 
Identity , to use a Freudian expression , was reduced to the narcissism of minor differences . 
Nationalism is essentially a modern political creation wrapped in the mantle of a common history and shared memories . 
If Samson was a Hebrew hero , his nemesis Delilah must have been a Palestinian . 
Nor have ethnic loyalties always matched political boundaries . 
Even after the violent dismemberment of multiethnic Yugoslavia , none of the successor states can claim to be wholly homogeneous . 
Ethnic minorities in Slovenia and Serbia ( even with the exclusion of Albanian Kosovo ) account for between 20-30 % of the total population . 
Dictatorships , unlike democracies , are ill-equipped to accommodate ethnic and religious diversity . 
As we saw in Yugoslavia and are now seeing in the Arab Spring revolts , a multiethnic or multi-religious society and an authoritarian regime can be a recipe for state implosion . 
The dissolution of the Soviet Union , too , had much to do with the collapse of its multinational structure . 
Dozens of ethnic minorities live in China , where Muslim Uighurs , in particular , face official repression . 
India is a case apart . 
The vastness of Indian nationality , with its plethora of cultures , ethnicities , and religions , has not immunized it against ethnic tensions , but it has made India more a seat for a major world civilization than a mere nation-state . 
Conversely , ethnocentric nationalism is bound to distort a people &apos;s relations with the rest of the world . 
Zionism is a case in point . 
The enlightened ideology of a nation rising from the ashes of history has become a dark force in the hands of a new social and political elite that have perverted the idea . 
Zionism has lost its way as a defining paradigm for a nation willing to find a bridge with the surrounding Arab world . 
The European Union , a political community built on democratic consensus , was not established in order to bring about the end of the nation-state ; its purpose has been to turn nationalism into a benign force of transnational cooperation . 
More generally , democracies have shown that they can reconcile multiethnic and multilingual diversity with overall political unity . 
So long as particular groups are willing to abandon the politics of secession and embrace what Habermas calls &quot; constitutional patriotism , &quot; political decision-making can be decentralized . 
The recent electoral defeat of the secessionists in Quebec should serve as a lesson for separatists throughout Europe . 
Decades of constitutional uncertainty caused companies to leave Quebec in droves , which ruined Montreal as a corporate hub . 
Ultimately , the Québécois rebelled against the separatists &quot; delusion that the state from which they wanted to secede would cheerfully serve their interests . 
Likewise , the longstanding hemorrhage of talent and capital from Scotland might accelerate should nationalists succeed in persuading a majority of Scots to vote for secession this autumn . 
A similar risk can be found in Catalonia &apos;s bid for independence from Spain . 
The central state always has its own nation-building responsibilities . 
Putin can manipulate Ukraine not because there is a shred of credibility to his claim that the Russian minority there faces persecution , but because Ukraine &apos;s corrupt democracy failed to build a truly self-sustaining nation . 
Consider , by contrast , Italy &apos;s annexation of South Tyrol , a predominantly German-speaking region . 
The move was decided at the Versailles Peace Conference after World War I without consulting the population , which was 90 % German-speaking . 
Yet today , South Tyrol enjoys extensive constitutional autonomy , including full cultural freedom and a fiscal regime that leaves 90 % of tax revenues in the region . 
The bilingual , peaceful coexistence of the province &apos;s inhabitants can serve as a lesson to both rigid central governments and unrealistic secessionist movements elsewhere . 
For example , an unofficial poll recently showed that 89 % of residents in Italy &apos;s northern &quot; Repubblica Veneta &quot; back independence . 
Scotland could reach those extremes . 
The residents of Shetland , Orkney , and the Western Isles are already demanding the right to decide whether to remain part of an independent Scotland . 
One can easily imagine the government in Edinburgh opposing the new secessionists , just as Westminster opposes Scottish independence today . 
When the historian Ernest Renan dreamed of a European Confederation that would supersede the nation-state , he could not yet envisage the challenge posed by micro-states and para-states . 
He believed that &quot; man is a slave neither of his race nor his language , nor of his religion , nor of the course of rivers nor of the direction taken by mountain chains . &quot; 
Maybe so .
