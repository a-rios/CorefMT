Reinventing Energy 
NEW YORK Â­ - The world economy is being battered by sharply higher energy prices . 
While a few energy-exporting countries in the Middle East and elsewhere reap huge profits , the rest of the world is suffering as the price of oil has topped $ 110 per barrel and that of coal has doubled . 
Without plentiful and low-cost energy , every aspect of the global economy is threatened . 
For example , food prices are increasing alongside soaring oil prices , partly because of increased production costs , but also because farmland in the United States and elsewhere is being converted from food production to bio-fuel production . 
No quick fix exists for oil prices . 
Higher prices reflect basic conditions of supply and demand . The world economy - especially China , India , and elsewhere in Asia - has been growing rapidly , leading to a steep increase in global demand for energy , notably for electricity and transport . 
Yet global supplies of oil , natural gas , and coal cannot easily keep up , even with new discoveries . 
And , in many places , oil supplies are declining as old oil fields are depleted . 
Coal is in somewhat larger supply , and can be turned into liquid fuels for transport . 
Yet coal is an inadequate substitute , partly because of limited supplies , and partly because coal emits large amounts of carbon dioxide per unit of energy , and therefore is a dangerous source of man-made climate change . 
For developing countries to continue to enjoy rapid economic growth , and for rich countries to avoid a slump caused , it will be necessary to develop new energy technologies . 
Three objectives should be targeted : low-cost alternatives to fossil fuels , greater energy efficiency , and reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions . 
The most promising technology in the long term is solar power . 
The total solar radiation hitting the planet is about 1,000 times the world &apos;s commercial energy use . 
This means that even a small part of the earth &apos;s land surface , notably in desert regions , which receive massive solar radiation , can supply large amounts of the electricity for much of the rest of the world . 
For example , solar power plants in America &apos;s Mohave Desert could supply more than half of the country &apos;s electricity needs . 
Solar power plants in Northern Africa could supply power to Western Europe . 
And solar power plants in the Sahel of Africa , just south of the vast Sahara , could supply power to much of West , East , and Central Africa . 
Perhaps the single most promising development in terms of energy efficiency is &quot; plug-in hybrid technology &quot; for automobiles , which may be able to triple the fuel efficiency of new automobiles within the next decade . 
The idea is that automobiles would run mainly on batteries recharged each night on the electricity grid , with a gasoline-hybrid engine as a backup to the battery . 
General Motors might have an early version by 2010 . 
The most important technology for the safe environmental use of coal is the capture and geological storage of carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants . 
Such &quot; carbon capture and sequestration , &quot; or CCS , is urgently needed in the major coal-consuming countries , especially China , India , Australia , and the US . 
The key CCS technologies have already been developed ; it is time to move from engineering blueprints to real demonstration power plants . 
For all of these promising technologies , governments should be investing in the science and high costs of early-stage testing . 
Without at least partial public financing , the uptake of these new technologies will be slow and uneven . 
Indeed , most major technologies that we now take for granted - airplanes , computers , the Internet , and new medicines , to name but a few - received crucial public financing in the early stages of development and deployment . 
It is shocking , and worrisome , that public financing remains slight , because these technologies &quot; success could translate into literally trillions of dollars of economic output . 
For example , according to the most recent data from the International Energy Agency , in 2006 the US government invested a meager $ 3 billion per year in energy research and development . 
In inflation-adjusted dollars , this represented a decline of roughly 40 % since the early 1980 &quot; s , and now equals what the US spends on its military in just 1.5 days . 
The situation is even more discouraging when we look at the particulars . 
US government funding for renewable energy technologies ( solar , wind , geothermal , ocean , and bio-energy ) totaled a meager $ 239 million , or just three hours of defense spending . 
Spending on carbon capture and sequestration was just $ 67 million , while spending for energy efficiency of all types ( buildings , transport , and industry ) was $ 352 million . 
Of course , developing new energy technologies is not America &apos;s responsibility alone . 
Global cooperation on energy technologies is needed both to increase supplies and to ensure that energy use is environmentally safe , especially to head off man-made climate change from the use of fossil fuels . 
This would not only be good economics , but also good politics , since it could unite the world in our common interest , rather than dividing the world in a bitter struggle over diminishing oil , gas , and coal reserves .
