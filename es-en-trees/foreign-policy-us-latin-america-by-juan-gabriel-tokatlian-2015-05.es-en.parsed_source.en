Latin America Between Kennan and Obama 
BUENOS AIRES - The late American diplomat and strategist George Kennan is remembered as the creator of the doctrine of &quot; containment , &quot; which formed the centerpiece of the United States &quot; policy for waging the Cold War . 
But Kennan was also among the key architects of another US grand strategy : the &quot; dominance and discipline &quot; approach toward Latin America . 
While less discussed , the latter strategy has long outlasted the Cold War . 
Fortunately , this may finally be changing , thanks to US President Barack Obama . 
In 1950 - four years after sending an 8,000-word cable to US Secretary of State George Marshall detailing his views on the Soviet Union and US policy toward it - Kennan sent another memorandum to Secretary of State Dean Acheson . 
This time , he argued that the US needed to take a tougher stance in regions with communist connections and sympathies . 
The report , which Kennan produced after a tour of Latin America , included a series of notable assertions about the region . 
For starters , Kennan claimed that the particular combination of &quot; nature and human behavior &quot; in Latin America had produced a uniquely &quot; unhappy and hopeless background for the conduct of human life . &quot; 
Impediments to progress in the region , Kennan observed , were &quot; written in human blood and in the tracings of geography , &quot; and the solutions that had been proposed were &quot; feeble and unpromising . &quot; 
This , he argued , had produced a &quot; subconscious recognition of the failure of group efforts , &quot; which manifested itself &quot; in an exaggerated self-centeredness and egotism . &quot; 
In Kennan &apos;s view , it was critical that Latin America resist the &quot; communist pressures &quot; emanating from the Soviet Union - an outcome that the US should help to bring about . 
That meant , first and foremost , creating incentives for Latin American governments to implement pro-US policies . 
But the incentives that Kennan envisioned were not all positive . 
On the contrary , he argued that &quot; where the concepts and traditions of popular government are too weak to absorb successfully the intensity of the communist attack , &quot; the US must concede that &quot; harsh governmental measures &quot; to repress communist sentiment were the &quot; only answer . &quot; 
While such measures &quot; would not stand the test of American concepts of democratic procedure , &quot; he was convinced that they were necessary . 
Similarly , Kennan saw a need for increased US investment in Latin America , with business leaders deploying their &quot; financial power &quot; judiciously . 
But he also observed that bribery may have &quot; replaced diplomatic interventions as the main protection of private capital . &quot; 
In that sense , the prospects for private investment in Latin America were based , in many cases , on &quot; the corruptibility , rather than on the enlightenment , of the local regimes . &quot; 
Kennan &apos;s policy recommendations centered on dominance . 
The US , he believed , should emphasize its position as a great power - one that needed Latin America far less than Latin America needed the US . 
If Latin American governments did not cooperate with the US , they would be directly or indirectly disciplined . 
As he put it , &quot; the danger of a failure to exhaust the possibilities of our mutual relationship is always greater to them than to us . &quot; 
That assumption has shaped US policy toward the region ever since . 
But now Obama appears determined to bring US policy , at long last , into the twenty-first century . 
At the recent Summit of the Americas in Panama , Obama highlighted the fact that &quot; the Cold War has been over for a long time . &quot; 
Rather than remaining locked in battles that began before he was born , Obama continued , he would seek to cooperate with Latin American leaders to solve today &apos;s problems . 
Moreover , Obama reiterated his desire for a &quot; new beginning &quot; in the US-Cuba relationship . 
And , unlike the first such declaration , made at the 2009 Summit of the Americas , this one was followed by concrete action , with Obama removing Cuba from the US list of states that sponsor terrorism . 
Despite these positive steps , however , the US has not fully escaped the legacy of Cold War coercive democracy . 
Nowhere is this more apparent than in Obama &apos;s recent executive order imposing sanctions on seven mid-level Venezuelan law-enforcement and military officials , who are accused of violating protesters &quot; rights during last year &apos;s anti-government demonstrations . 
The move highlights the persistent influence of Kennan &apos;s belief that the US maintains a right - indeed , a responsibility - to intervene in the domestic affairs of Latin American countries where government policies are not to its liking . 
If the US is serious about establishing a genuine partnership with its Latin American neighbors , it must change not only its policies , but also the attitudes - rooted in a long-standing presumption of cultural superiority - that underpin them . 
The question now is how long Obama &apos;s new message of sincere dialogue and shared interests with Latin America will coexist with Kennan &apos;s hegemonic strategy before one or the other prevails . 
In this sense , next year &apos;s US presidential election may prove to be a watershed .
