The Bookies and the British Election 
LONDON - I used to be considered a pretty good forecaster of British and other countries &quot; elections . 
I was , after all , once a party chairman . 
I can now confess my method . 
It was not based on any novel political insight . 
I did not have a magic algorithm relating economic factors to voting intentions - though I do think that there is some correlation between net disposable income and how people normally vote . 
What I do is not very sophisticated : I watch the bookmakers &quot; odds . 
Doing so proved invaluable as recently as the Scottish independence referendum last September . 
Two days before the count , bookmakers were paying out to gamblers who had bet that Scotland would vote &quot; No &quot; to independence . 
Guess which way Scotland actually voted . 
My method is based largely on the observation that you rarely hear of a poor bookie . 
The problem now is that the British general election in May is too close to call . 
So the bookmakers have 2 : 5 odds on no party gaining an outright majority , and 10 : 11 on either Labour or the Conservatives winning the largest number of seats . 
So I cannot predict the outcome , and neither can the masters of the universe in the City of London , who always become jittery in the face of political uncertainty . 
What I can do is try to explain why that uncertainty exists . 
First , as in many other democracies , support for the United Kingdom &apos;s two main political parties is declining . 
When I first became interested in politics , nearly 50 years ago , Labour and the Conservatives attracted some 90 % of the popular vote . 
In May , their combined share will be about 65 % to 70 % . 
There are several reasons for this . 
One is the decline of the traditional working class and the growth of a more affluent middle class , underpinned by changes in occupation and housing . 
Trade-union membership and public-sector employment have fallen . 
The number of people joining political parties has dropped sharply as ideological identification with either the left or the right has waned . 
Add to this the rise of populist and nationalist parties in Britain , partly a consequence of the political and economic alienation that have resulted from globalization and economic troubles , and Labour and the Conservatives are fighting over dwindling support . 
The latest polls indicate 34 % support for Labour , and 32 % for the Conservatives . 
Labour &apos;s popularity has been trending down from the high 30s over the last couple of years ; the Conservatives have remained stuck at around 30 % . 
Several factors make predicting the outcome even more problematic . 
For starters , the electoral system is tipped sharply in Labour &apos;s favor . 
It takes more votes to elect a Conservative than a Labour MP , owing to the over-representation of urban Britain and some majority-Labour parts of the country . 
As a result , psephologists calculate that the Conservatives have to win at least 4 % more of the popular vote than Labour in order to win more seats . 
Second , the anti-immigration , anti-European UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) takes more votes - perhaps as much as 50 % - from the Conservatives than it does from the Labour party . 
It looks as though UKIP &apos;s support may have peaked , and that some of the air is escaping from the party &apos;s tires . 
Third , on the other side of the fence , the Scottish National Party appears to be attracting a large number of former Labour supporters . 
Many working-class voters in western Scotland used to vote for the SNP in Scottish Parliament elections , but would drift back to Labour in UK general elections . 
But some believe that this pattern has been disrupted , owing to a sense that Labour has taken its traditional supporters for granted . 
Ed Miliband , the Labour leader , seems to be just as unpopular in Scotland as his Conservative counterpart , Prime Minister David Cameron . 
Leadership is an area where the Conservatives are already ahead in opinion polls . 
They have a substantial lead on economic issues as well , as the news continues to support the party &apos;s contention that the recovery in growth and employment , along with low inflation , are now benefiting the entire country . 
Conservatives will hammer away on the economy , as they did in 1992 , the last time that they won an election outright . 
Labour , for its part , will seek to focus voters &quot; attention on issues that are thought to be toxic for the government , like the National Health Service . 
With the campaign already underway , no one should expect the main protagonists to depart significantly in the weeks ahead from the themes that they have already espoused . 
What happens if the outcome matches the bookies &quot; predictions ? 
There will presumably be months of attempts to build coalitions out of improbable alliances ; then maybe there will be another election ( assuming Parliament can change the law mandating its five-year term ) . 
I hope it does not come to that , and that when the battle smoke clears , Cameron will be left - as he deserves to be - the only man standing .
