History &apos;s Ghosts in Iran 
Using historical analogies to interpret the present is both tempting and dangerous , for history never truly repeats itself . 
Yet , to understand the difficulty of responding to the problems that Iran &apos;s nuclear ambition and anti-Israel obsession now pose , it might be helpful to analyze the three analogies that are most commonly used . 
Some compare the Iranian regime to Nazi Germany . 
Others believe that the only useful analogy is to Europe &apos;s old balance-of-power games . 
And still others combine the two , pointing to the &quot; balance of terror &quot; during the Cold War . 
In other words : is Iran to be treated as Hitler &apos;s Germany in 1938 , Prussia in 1756 , or Stalin &apos;s Soviet Union ? 
Each analogy contains an element of truth , but none , of course , corresponds to the realities of the challenges Iran represents . 
Above all , each analogy , if taken seriously , should lead to a specific course of action , and this is far from being the case today . 
Let us start with the analogy between Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hitler . 
Ahmedinejad pursues a dual objective with his anti-Zionist obsession : to de-legitimize Israel and to re-legitimize Iran &apos;s claim to speak for Muslims over the heads of their more cautious governments . 
He very probably means what he says about Jews and Israel , but is he a latter-day Hitler , and is today &apos;s Iran the equivalent of Germany in the 1930 &quot; s ? 
Hitler came close to developing the nuclear bomb , but never had it , whereas Iran very well might . 
But Hitler &apos;s power over Germany was much more absolute than Ahmadinejad &apos;s power over Iran . 
The results of Iran &apos;s recent municipal elections were humiliating for Ahmadinejad and his supporters . 
Those elections would have been unthinkable in Nazi Germany . 
Although the Iranian regime &apos;s rhetoric may be totalitarian , political power there is much more diffused . 
The analogy with Hitler &apos;s Germany is also problematic because , if it were regarded as true , the only sensible course of action would be a preventive strike on Iran and the removal of Ahmadinejad . 
Given the evolution of American strategic thinking after Iraq ( and now Afghanistan ) , and of Israel &apos;s strategic thinking after Lebanon , a preventive strike is highly unlikely . 
The second analogy , to the old balance-of-power system in Europe , is especially popular among Israeli and American diplomats . 
According to this view , if Iran wants to de-legitimize Israel and ultimately unite Moslems against the West , the only answer is to isolate Iran in the Middle East , and to create alliances against Iran with moderate Sunni Arab regimes . 
Before the 1979 Iranian revolution , some in Israel advocated an alliance between Israel , Turkey , and Iran , the Middle East &apos;s three non-Arab powers . 
Today , many in the United States and Israel dream of a moderate Arab front , with countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt containing and isolating &quot; radical &quot; Iran . 
That diplomatic project is far from absurd . 
The rise of Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon as instruments of Iranian ambitions can only worry moderate Arab regimes . 
But such an alliance has a price : the resumption of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians , with serious territorial concessions on Israel &apos;s part to match the Palestinians &quot; absolute recognition of Israel . 
Moderate Arab regimes will not dare to engage in an open and serious process of rapprochement with Israel in the absence of real progress over the Palestinian issue . 
But are the two parties ready for it ? 
Could the US , a wounded power mired in Iraq , implement the part of the Baker report that suggests &quot; Peace in Baghdad goes through Jerusalem &quot; ? 
While Israel &apos;s non-victory in Lebanon and the Palestinians &quot; bloody divisions mean that both sides have been humbled , a breakthrough , though possible , remains unlikely . 
The third analogy is reflected in Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert &apos;s recent references to Israel &apos;s nuclear deterrent , which may have been a mistake , but probably indicate the evolution of Israeli strategic thinking . 
Olmert seemed to be reminding the Iranians of the hard realities of nuclear deterrence : Iran may join the nuclear club someday , but it will return to the Stone Age if it uses those weapons against a country that has a far more advanced nuclear arsenal . 
The comparison here is to the Cold War period . 
But can today &apos;s Iran be compared to the Soviet Union ? 
The success of the &quot; balance of terror &quot; presupposed a mixture of confrontation and dialogue between two &quot; rational actors . &quot; 
Can Iran under Ahmadinejad be considered a rational actor ? 
The dilemma concerning Iran is whether a power imbued with an &quot; absolute &quot; ideology can be allowed to be in control of an &quot; absolute &quot; weapon . 
Since a military solution is highly improbable , what are the serious alternatives ? 
Can we have a productive dialogue with Iran while rejecting the mad ideology of its president ? 
As the shortcomings of the three most popular historical analogies suggest , the answer is far from obvious .
