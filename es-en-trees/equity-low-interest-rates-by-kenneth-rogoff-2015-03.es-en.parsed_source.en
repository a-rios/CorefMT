The Stock-Bond Disconnect 
CAMBRIDGE - How should one understand the disconnect between the new highs reached by global equity indices and the new depths plumbed by real interest rates worldwide ? 
Several competing explanations attempt to reconcile these trends , and getting it right is essential for calibrating monetary and fiscal policy appropriately . 
The most popular explanations downplay risk factors in a way that can be dangerously misleading . 
For example , the &quot; secular stagnation &quot; theory claims that low interest rates tell the true story . 
The global economy is suffering from a chronic demand shortfall , which can be remedied through sustained growth in government spending . 
According to this view , soaring stock markets merely reflect low discounting of future profits . 
Moreover , labor &apos;s share of profits seems to have fallen markedly in recent decades across the world &apos;s eight largest economies , with the possible exception of the United Kingdom . 
Conversely , capital &apos;s share of profits has been rising , which of course raises the value of equities ( though , stock prices have continued to rise in countries like the US and the UK where labor shares have begun at least a cyclical recovery , and where interest-rate hikes may soon be on the horizon ) . 
Proponents of secular stagnation argue that government spending as a share of GDP , which has more than doubled in most advanced economies since the 1950s , should continue to rise . 
Although one can readily agree that high-yielding government investments in education and infrastructure are especially justified today , the idea that demand permanently constrains supply in a significant way is dubious . 
More refined studies of the recent recession suggest that the lasting so-called &quot; hysteresis &quot; effects on unemployment have been limited , at least in the US . 
Another possible explanation of low interest rates is financial repression . 
The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan , like the Federal Reserve before them , are gluttonously buying bonds . 
At the same time , a host of new regulations to promote financial stability are forcing banks , pension funds , and insurance companies to stock up on government securities . 
Thus , today &apos;s low interest rates are more a reflection of distortions in financial markets than of low growth expectations . 
Proponents of the financial repression explanation essentially view low interest rates as a hidden tax on bondholders , who receive a lower interest rate than they would otherwise . 
This is not necessarily a bad thing , given that all taxes are distorting , and that there really is no way to deal with today &apos;s outsize debt burdens that does not impinge on growth in some way . 
But the financial repression tax is not nearly as progressive as a more general wealth tax would be , because lower-income households typically have a smaller share of their assets in equities . 
In any event , it is unclear how financial repression can be the whole story . 
The fall in bond yields has extended to a far broader range of debt than just government paper . 
Other factors are contributing to today &apos;s ultra-low interest-rate environment as well . 
Adverse demographics and declining labor-supply growth in most advanced economies are undeniably important . 
The puzzle , though , is that this trend has played out in a very gradual and predictable way , whereas the decline in interest rates has been more rapid and somewhat unexpected ( certainly by central banks ) . 
And it is difficult to argue that weak demographics is the main driver of strong stock prices , though some have tried . 
Curiously , heightened risk and fears of further disruptions - not just another financial crisis , but also geopolitical instability and pandemics - do not seem to carry much weight in current policy discussions , though the idea has been around . 
Though bonds are hardly a perfect hedge against such risks , they typically beat stocks ( except , perhaps , in cases of global conflagration , when both fare badly ) . 
In recent work with Carmen and Vincent Reinhart , we show that even relatively minor shifts in disaster risk - say , a rise from a normal 2-3 % to 3-4 % - can lead to a massive decline in global real interest rates , even taking them well into negative territory . 
This can be the case even if expected growth is strong . 
But the policy implications of this are not straightforward . 
If , on the other hand , the public is basically right about heightened disaster risks , the policy issues become much more complex . 
The problem is that the government likely faces high costs if a disaster strikes , which implies a high option value to preserving fiscal space for when it is most needed . 
The idea that hyper-low interest rates are merely symptoms of deficient demand or financial repression is dangerously simplistic . 
Surely heightened public concern about the risk of future economic catastrophe in the wake of the financial crisis is still playing an important role , reinforced by lingering fragility in the eurozone and rising instability in emerging markets . 
But if the risks that might help explain the price trends for stocks and bonds are real , policymakers , too , should be careful not to throw caution to the wind .
