The Diseases of Global Warming 
Today few scientists doubt that Earth &apos;s atmosphere is warming . 
Most also agree that the rate of heating is accelerating and that the consequences could become increasingly disruptive . 
Even schoolchildren can recite some projected outcomes : oceans will warm and glaciers will melt , causing sea levels to rise and salt water to inundate low-lying coastal areas . 
Regions suitable for farming will shift . 
But less familiar effects of global warming - namely , serious human medical disorders - are no less worrisome . 
Many are already upon us . 
Most directly , global warming is projected to double the number of deaths related to heat waves by 2020 . 
Prolonged heat can increase smog and the dispersal of allergens , causing respiratory symptoms . 
Global warming also boosts the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts . 
Such disasters not only cause death by drowning or starvation , but also damage crops and make them vulnerable to infection and infestations by pests and choking weeds , thereby contributing to food shortages and malnutrition . 
They displace entire populations , leading to overcrowding and associated diseases , such as tuberculosis . 
Developing countries - where resources to prevent and treat infectious diseases are scarce - are most vulnerable to other infectious diseases associated with climate change as well . 
International commerce and travel enable infectious diseases to strike continents away from their sources . 
Of course , not all the human health consequences of global warming may be bad . 
Very high temperatures in hot regions may reduce snail populations , which have a role in transmitting schistosomiasis , a parasitic disease . 
High winds - caused by parching of the earth &apos;s surface - may disperse pollution . 
Warmer winters in normally chilly areas may reduce cold-related heart attacks and respiratory ailments . 
Overall , however , the undesirable effects of more variable and extreme weather are likely to overshadow any benefits . 
Diseases relayed by mosquitoes - malaria , dengue fever , yellow fever , and several kinds of encephalitis - are eliciting particularly grave concern as the world warms . 
These disorders are projected to become increasingly prevalent because cold weather limits mosquitoes to seasons and regions with certain minimum temperatures . 
Extreme heat also limits mosquito survival . 
Greater heat also speeds the rate at which pathogens inside them reproduce and mature . 
The immature malaria parasite takes 26 days to develop fully at 68 degrees F , but only 13 days at 77 degrees F. The Anopheles mosquitoes that spread malaria live only several weeks , so warmer temperatures enable more parasites to mature in time for the mosquitoes to transfer the infection . 
As whole areas heat up , mosquitoes enter formerly forbidden territories , bringing illness with them , while causing more disease for longer periods in the areas they already inhabit . 
Malaria has already returned to the Korean peninsula , and parts of the US , southern Europe and the former Soviet Union have experienced small outbreaks . 
Some models project that by the end of this century , the zone of potential malaria transmission will contain about 60 % of the world &apos;s population , up from 45 % now . 
Similarly , Dengue ( or &quot; breakbone &quot; ) fever - a severe flu-like viral illness that can cause fatal internal bleeding - has broadened its range in the Americas over the past 10 years , reaching down to Buenos Aires by the end of the 1990 &apos;s . 
( It has also found its way to northern Australia . ) 
Today it afflicts an estimated 50-100 million people in the tropics and subtropics . 
These outbreaks , of course , cannot be traced conclusively to global warming . 
Other factors - declines in mosquito-control and other public health programs , or rising drug and pesticide resistance - could be involved . 
Such is the case in the world &apos;s highlands . 
In the 19th century , European colonists in Africa settled in the cooler mountains to escape the dangerous swamp air ( &quot; mal aria &quot; ) in the lowlands . 
Today many of those havens are compromised . 
As anticipated , warmth is climbing up many mountains . 
Since 1970 , the elevation at which temperatures are always below freezing has ascended almost 500 feet in the tropics . 
Insect-borne infections are being reported at high elevations in South and Central America , Asia , and east and central Africa . 
More droughts and floods due to global warming will also probably fuel outbreaks of water-borne diseases . 
Paradoxically , droughts can favor water-borne diseases - including cholera , a cause of severe diarrhea - by wiping out supplies of safe drinking water , concentrating contaminants , and preventing good hygiene . 
Lack of clean water also limits safe rehydration of diarrhea or fever sufferers . 
Floods , meanwhile , wash sewage and fertilizer into water supplies , triggering expansive blooms of harmful algae that are either directly toxic to humans , or contaminate the fish and shellfish that humans consume . 
The human health toll taken by global warming will depend to a large extent on us . 
Effective surveillance of climate conditions and of the emergence or resurgence of infectious diseases ( or their carriers ) should be a global priority , as should providing preventive measures and treatments to at-risk populations . 
But we must also limit human activities that contribute to atmospheric heating , or that exacerbate its effects . 
Little doubt remains that burning fossil fuels contributes to global warming by spewing carbon dioxide and other heat-absorbing , or &quot; greenhouse , &quot; gases into the air . 
Analysis of tree rings identifies fossil fuels as the source of the 30 % increase in greenhouse gases over pre-industrial levels . 
Cleaner energy sources must be adopted , while forests and wetlands must be preserved and restored to absorb carbon dioxide , and to absorb floodwaters and filter contaminants before they reach water supplies . 
None of this will come cheap .
