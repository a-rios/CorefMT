The Google that Can Say No 
NEW YORK - Usually , disclosure statements go at the end of an article , but let me start with mine . 
I sit on the board of Yandex , a Russian search company with a roughly 60 % market share in Russia , compared to Google &apos;s 20 % or so . 
I am also an investor in and advisor to AnchorFree , the company that offers Hotspot Shield , a publicly accessible virtual private network ( VPN ) that allows users to keep their browsing private , whether they are concerned about thieves stealing their banking details or about governments monitoring where they surf . 
We have about one million users monthly in China ( out of seven million worldwide ) . 
And I sit on the board of 23andMe , a company co-founded by the wife of Sergey Brin , the co-founder of Google . 
So I have a variety of interests in the topic of Google &apos;s recent moves in China . 
In the beginning , I supported Google &apos;s presence in China . 
My fundamental belief is that every time a user gets information , it reinforces a little part of the brain that says : &quot; It &apos;s good to know things . 
It &apos;s my right to have information , whether it &apos;s about train schedules , movie stars , or the activities of the politicians who make decisions that affect my life . &quot; 
If you can ask questions about some things but not about others , eventually you start to wonder about that fact itself . 
Google &apos;s ( and my ) hopes that it could help liberate China look a little na√Øve now . 
Of course , censorship is not a big secret in China . 
China employs approximately 30,000 people as censors . 
They have names and faces , and they may negotiate with a publisher about a particularly sensitive topic . 
They are less likely to negotiate with bloggers , because there are so many bloggers , but the government reportedly does train bloggers in how to post in support of government policy , and if you are lucky you can get a job ( reportedly at $ 0.50 per post ) doing the government &apos;s bidding . 
So why has Google made a fuss and threatened to walk out of China ? 
The answer probably stems from a combination of - or rather , a changing calculus around - business interests and values . 
The censorship issue has long grated at Google ( Brin , with his Russian background , is reported to be especially hostile to censorship ) , but the company could argue that transparency about censorship was better than not serving China at all . 
The censorship , however , has been getting worse . 
Perhaps the initial argument was wrong : Exposing Chinese censorship has done little to reduce it . 
Many Chinese support government censorship : They see it as a way to maintain civility and order . 
They know that their government is fragile , and they consider criticism harmful rather than cleansing . 
They trust their government to deal with problems over time . 
At the same time , while China represents a huge market in the ever-receding future , it has not been an especially lucrative market for Google so far . 
Baidu , the indigenous Chinese rival to Google , benefits in many ways both from government support and from home-team nationalism among users . 
More generally , China probably looks less appealing to investors now than it did a few years ago , not so much because of the Chinese economy as a whole , but because of constraints on the ability of any foreign entity to make serious long-term profits . 
This growing disillusion was already present when a wave of cyber-attacks on Google ( and other companies ) forced the company to re-assess its entire China strategy . 
There are certainly other ways that Google could have handled the issue - for example , by capitulating to the Chinese government &apos;s various requests . 
When you go into a situation like this - whether joining a board or entering a market - you always have one option left , which is to walk away . 
If you cannot do that , you have no negotiating power . 
That is what Google has done in China - where its move is irrevocable . 
The company can &apos;t go back to the old situation . 
So , while Google is unlikely to re-enter China for the foreseeable future , the company has improved its negotiating position in whatever other disputes it might have in the future . 
( And it has won support from the US government . ) 
What can Google do now ? 
My friends at AnchorFree want Google to support Hotspot Shield in some form or other , although Google &apos;s exit from China might be support enough . 
Hotspot Shield is one of the best ways of &quot; scaling the wall &quot; to peer outside the locked-down Chinese Internet and use sites such as Twitter , Facebook , and , of course , Google.com ( as opposed to Google.cn ) . 
Like Google in the past , AnchorFree may operate more effectively by being discreet , without loud support from Google or other &quot; foreign interests . &quot; 
Its Web site is often blocked in countries such as China ( and many in the Middle East ) , but there are usually other ways to obtain the software . 
Google , too , may be blocked , but there are ways to get to it for those who are determined . The next steps are up to the Chinese users themselves . 
In the end , China knows that it can &apos;t make the Internet airtight . 
So someone in the Chinese government is probably having regrets . 
It &apos;s tempting to predict how this will end . 
As within Google , so within China : decisions are made , but not everyone agrees with them . 
There &apos;s a conflict between business interests and moral values . The tug-of-war will continue for the foreseeable future . But in this little battle of a long war , transparency has won a victory .
