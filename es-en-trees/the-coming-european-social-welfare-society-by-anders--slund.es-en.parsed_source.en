Where Europe Works 
STOCKHOLM - With Swedish cities roiled for weeks now by rioting by unemployed immigrants , many observers see a failure of the country &apos;s economic model . 
They are wrong . 
The Swedish / Scandinavian model that has emerged over the last 20 years has provided the only viable route to sustained growth that Europe has seen in decades . 
Europeans should remember that perceptions of strength and weakness change fast . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , Scandinavian countries stood for chronic budget deficits , high inflation , and repeated devaluations . 
In 1999 , The Economist labeled Germany &quot; the sick man of the euro &quot; - a monument of European sclerosis , with low growth and high unemployment . 
Now , however , the specter of devaluation has disappeared from northern European countries . 
Budgets are close to balance , with less public expenditure and lower tax rates , while economic growth has recovered . 
The transformation of the old European welfare state started in northern Europe , and it is proceeding to most of the rest of the continent . 
Today , it is difficult to imagine the mindset that prevailed before Margaret Thatcher came to power in the United Kingdom in 1979 and Ronald Reagan in the United States in 1981 . 
Thatcher &apos;s greatest achievement was the liberalization of the overregulated British labor market , while Reagan turned the tide with his inaugural address : &quot; In this present crisis , government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem . &quot; 
The moral superiority of high marginal income taxes suddenly waned . 
In northern Europe , the transformation of the welfare state started in Denmark in 1982 . 
In deep financial crisis , traditionally social-democratic Denmark elected a conservative prime minister , Poul Schlüter , a jovial man with a bow tie . 
One of his first decisions was to peg the Danish krone to the Deutschmark to stop the inflation-devaluation cycle . 
The Danish peg - now to the euro - still holds . 
Schlüter &apos;s second big decision was to deregulate the Danish economy , which now has the world &apos;s largest number of enterprises per citizen . 
But he left the country &apos;s high taxes and welfare state in place . 
In the early 1990 &quot; s , Norway , Sweden , and Finland experienced a horrendous real-estate , banking , and currency crisis . 
Output fell and unemployment skyrocketed . 
In 1991 , Swedish voters broke the reign of the Social Democrats , electing a coalition government under conservative Prime Minister Carl Bildt , who called his program &quot; the only way . &quot; 
Bildt tried to follow Schlüter &apos;s lead , but , in 1992 , Sweden was forced to devalue - though his deregulation of markets did work well . 
Sweden &apos;s greatest achievement was a gradual cut of public spending by no less than one-fifth of GDP from 1993 to 2007 . 
Meanwhile , Sweden &apos;s public debt was reduced from 73 % of GDP to 39 % of GDP , while taxes have been cut repeatedly . 
The Social Democrats returned to power in 1994 , but they accepted Bildt &apos;s new fiscal policies , and even carried out a revolutionary pension reform in 1998 that properly tied benefits to payments . 
In parallel with the Scandinavian crisis , communism collapsed in Eastern Europe in 1989 and in 1991 in the Baltic states . 
Poland &apos;s first post-communist finance minister , Leszek Balcerowicz , showed an amazed world how communism could be abolished and a market economy built almost instantly . 
The rest of Central Europe and the Baltic states followed his lead . 
Former Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar was the most radical European reformer . 
Indeed , his ideas about taxation have revolutionized Europe . 
In 1994 , he introduced a flat personal-income tax , a policy that most Eastern European countries have since adopted . 
In 1999 , when Laar became Prime Minister again , he abolished the tax on corporate profit , which was harming entrepreneurship . 
As a consequence of the ensuing tax competition , corporate-tax rates have fallen to 15-25 % in most European countries . 
More broadly , Estonia has revolutionized public finances . 
Since 1992 , it has maintained a more or less balanced budget , with hardly any public debt . 
It slashed public expenditure and capped spending at 35 % of GDP - the same level as in the United States . 
As free-market thinking has taken hold and similar reforms have proliferated , the social-welfare state is being transformed into a social-welfare society . 
Government spending remains large enough to guarantee reasonable public services and a social safety net . 
Reformers have exposed the public sector to competition , not least from private providers , rendering it more efficient . 
The systematic reforms in the United Kingdom , Denmark , Sweden , Poland , and Estonia have much in common . 
First , all were caused by a profound crisis of the social-welfare state : falling output , rising unemployment , large budget deficits , inflation , and devaluation . 
Without severe crisis , no significant reform was likely . 
Second , a change of government through elections prompted reforms and gave them democratic legitimacy . 
Reform does not require a state of emergency , as is often argued . 
Third , reforms require a strong leader . 
No major reform has been undertaken through consensus , though successful reforms usually generate a broad consensus a few years later . 
At that point , reforms can be carried forward by those who had initially opposed them , as happened in Denmark and Sweden . 
Finally , fundamental reform of the social-welfare state requires leaders who embrace free-market ideas . 
Rethinking requires a new ideology , and , after one country has shown the right direction , neighbors often follow . 
Europe has now reached the point at which most of its laggards are prepared to accept the social-welfare society . 
This humane European capitalism is now hastening toward crisis-ridden southern Europe .
