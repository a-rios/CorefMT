Iran &apos;s Supreme Power Struggle 
WASHINGTON , DC - Iran &apos;s Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has never been happy about the status of the Iranian presidency - neither during his own tenure , from 1981-1989 , nor during the terms of his three successors . 
Tension between the president and the Supreme Leader is built into the Islamic Republic &apos;s core . 
The Supreme Leader has absolute authority and can veto decisions made by the executive , legislative , and judicial branches of government . 
At the same time , the president emerges from an electoral process with an agenda and ambitions of his own . 
During a president &apos;s second term - which Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has now begun - the tensions inevitably emerge into public view . 
Khamenei has never been willing to tolerate a president with a large independent power base . 
In the past , he clipped the wings of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who had strong ties to the merchant class , and of Mohammad Khatami , a reformer whose support came from Westernized middle-class professionals . 
Though Ahmadinejad received the Supreme Leader &apos;s support in the face of large-scale protests against his re-election last year , Khamenei does not appear hesitant about limiting the president &apos;s power . 
In fact , it appears that the massive demonstrations against Ahmadinejad delayed their confrontation , since both the Supreme Leader and the president rallied publicly to defend the legitimacy of the election . 
But Ahmadinejad &apos;s radical Islamist views and his support among religious , lower middle-class Iranians have not protected him from Khamenei . 
For the most part , the two men have avoided head-on confrontation . 
Their struggle is visible , however , in their maneuvering inside other branches of government . 
In this arena , Ahmadinejad faces off against Ali Larijani , the speaker of the parliament , and his brother , Sadeq Larijani , who is the head of the Iranian judiciary . 
The Larijani brothers have been vehement critics of the president , whom they accuse of ignoring legislation and key judicial rulings . 
Within the parliament , the conservative bloc is divided between supporters of Ahmadinejad and advocates of more parliamentary oversight of the president . 
Recently , parliament demonstrated its opposition to Ahmadinejad &apos;s economic policies by deciding to remove the president from his traditional post as head of the General Assembly of the Central Bank . 
This would reduce Ahmadinejad &apos;s ability to intervene in economic policies and keep him from naming the bank &apos;s governor . 
But this decision is contingent on the approval of the Guardian Council , where a group of the president &apos;s supporters have launched a counter-attack . 
They want the Supreme Leader to allow the president to issue warnings to both the parliament and the judiciary if he thinks they have overstepped their authority , thereby subordinating the Larijani brothers . 
Until now , parliament has been an effective tool for the Supreme Leader legitimately to rein in presidential authority , and it is difficult to imagine that the Larijani brothers would have mounted such a sharp challenge to Ahmadinejad without the Supreme Leader &apos;s approval . 
If they carry the day , the president will lose authority over the one area where his power has been greatest : the Iranian economy . 
By contrast , the president has no serious say in foreign policy , which is under the Supreme Leader &apos;s direct supervision . 
Khamenei is known to seek advice from various parties , but ultimately he makes decisions alone . 
For example , he overruled Iranian nuclear negotiators who offered a compromise during the Geneva negotiations in October 2009 . 
He has also diminished the foreign ministry &apos;s stature by appointing a number of special envoys in key areas . 
Khamenei does rely on Ahmadinejad to lead Iran &apos;s public diplomacy . 
The president travels widely , speaks frequently , and mobilizes political support with his anti-American and anti-Western rhetoric . 
But public diplomacy is not diplomacy itself . 
It is clear that no one in Ahmadinejad &apos;s inner circle - certainly not the president himself - has gained the Supreme Leader &apos;s confidence . 
The nuclear portfolio , for example , remains exclusively under Khamenei &apos;s control . 
Within the realm of religious politics , Khamenei has made careful use of Ahmadinejad &apos;s radicalism . 
It is widely believed that the president would like to reduce the clergy &apos;s influence and increase the power of the Revolutionary Guards , his main source of institutional support . 
Thus , Khamenei can present himself as a defender of the clergy , which , given widespread doubt about his clerical credentials since he took power 21 years ago , enhances his position . 
Clerics know that if Khamenei weakens , Ahmadinejad &apos;s circle can manipulate widespread anti-clerical resentment and exclude them from power . 
Moreover , Ahmadinejad knows that , without Khamenei &apos;s restraint , the clerics would use their political networks among conservatives like the Larijani brothers to limit the president further . 
The mutual hostility of Ahmadinejad and the clerical class offers the Supreme Leader the best of both worlds . 
The history of the Islamic Republic indicates that the power struggle between the Supreme Leader and the president never abates . 
It also suggests that the Supreme Leader will prove to be stronger . 
More importantly for the international community , this internal struggle keeps Iran &apos;s leaders from realistically appraising their foreign and nuclear policies . 
Consumed with their test of wills , they are unable to make well-informed and nuanced decisions in their dealings with outsiders .
