Thatcherism &apos;s Bellicose Soul 
LONDON - Margaret Thatcher was Britain &apos;s greatest twentieth-century peacetime prime minister . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , the near-simultaneous crisis of communism in the East and social democracy in the West gave her the opportunity to do great deeds . 
Her relationship with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev opened up the way to ending the Cold War ; her privatization policies showed the world how to dismantle state socialism . 
The neo-liberal revival of the 1980 &quot; s will always be known as the Reagan-Thatcher revolution . 
She was also the most divisive British prime minister of modern times , admired and reviled in equal measure , owing as much to the self-righteous way she pursued her policies as to the policies themselves . 
She rightly described herself as a &quot; conviction politician . &quot; 
A conviction is a settled belief that brooks no argument . 
And she did not deign to conciliate , instead dividing the political world into &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them . &quot; 
&quot; Where there is error , may we bring truth , &quot; she announced on her entry to No. 10 Downing Street , quoting Saint Francis of Assisi . 
&quot; In victory , magnanimity , &quot; Winston Churchill advised . 
Thatcher was brave and resolute , but she was not magnanimous . 
She won famous victories , but showed no generosity to the defeated , in word or deed . 
As a result , she failed to create harmony out of discord . 
Her mission was projected from a narrow ideological base . 
In instinct and language , she was a follower of Friedrich von Hayek . 
For Thatcher , as for Hayek , the great intellectual error of the twentieth century was the belief that the state could improve on the spontaneous efforts of individuals . 
What others saw as the state &apos;s role in elevating the condition of the people , she saw as the insidious road to serfdom . 
It is easy to see why this message resonated in Eastern Europe . 
Translated into British terms , it meant releasing the impulse to wealth creation from the dead hand of socialism , bureaucracy , and trade unions , which in her reading of history had brought about Britain &apos;s decline . 
The Good Samaritan , she said , was to be admired because he helped himself before helping the poor . 
This insular program of national revival increasingly estranged her from continental Europe &apos;s more dirigiste approach . 
In her famous Bruges speech in 1988 , she thundered : &quot; We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain , only to see them re-imposed at a European level , with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels . &quot; 
She left Britain &apos;s relations with the European Union in a mess from which they have never recovered . 
Of course , like any shrewd politician , Thatcher knew which battles were unwinnable , or had to be postponed ; but she always preferred winning a fight to reaching a compromise . 
She won the sobriquet &quot; Iron Lady &quot; for her decisive leadership in the Falklands War ; yet most of her battles were fought against sections of her own people - the &quot; enemy within , &quot; like the miners whom she crushed in the strike of 1984-1985 , or Ken Livingstone &apos;s Greater London Council , which she abolished in 1986 . 
She made much of her humble origins as the daughter of a Grantham grocer , and had no time for the Establishment , which she blamed for Britain &apos;s moral and economic decline . 
She understood the lower middle class , shared its material aspirations and moral prejudices , and argued for government spending cuts in the language of the housewife managing the weekly accounts . 
She rewarded &quot; aspirational &quot; members of the working class by selling off council houses at discounted prices . 
Support for the deserving poor was to her like charity wrung from the household budget . 
And , while she was Britain &apos;s most successful female politician ever , she regarded feminism as &quot; poison , &quot; and did little to encourage women to follow her . 
Thatcher &apos;s answers to the growing industrial disorder of the 1970 &quot; s were &quot; monetarism &quot; to liquidate inflation , legal curbs on trade-union power , and privatization of bloated state-owned industries - &quot; selling off the family silver &quot; as former Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan called it . 
The aim of all three measures was to restore both state authority and economic dynamism . 
With the help of North Sea oil , Thatcher reversed Britain &apos;s relative economic decline . 
But her victories came at a huge social cost , with unemployment rising to 12 % of the labor force ( three million people ) in 1984 , the highest since the 1930 &quot; s . 
For those growing up in the industrial north , Thatcherism foreclosed the future . 
The new economy based on finance and shopping skipped a generation . 
Much as they may have admired her , most Britons were never convinced that the Thatcher way was the only way . 
Although she won three consecutive elections , the Conservatives never polled more than 43 % of the popular vote , well below the levels achieved by Conservative leaders - Churchill , Anthony Eden , and Macmillan - in the 1950 &quot; s . 
Her approval rating exceeded 50 % in only five of her 137 months in office . 
Indeed , in economic and social affairs , the electorate grew steadily less Thatcherite during her years in office . 
Her missionary zeal fell on deaf ears . 
She owed her power to a divided opposition and a first-past-the-post electoral system . 
Thatcher offered her own summary of her political project : &quot; Economics are the method . 
The object is to change the soul . &quot; 
If that is the metric , then , despite her achievements , Thatcherism was a failure . 
The shift toward finance that Thatcher promoted heightened inequality and made the economy more volatile . 
Her &quot; right to buy &quot; policy triggered an upward spiral in house prices , which encouraged households to take on more and more debt . 
The &quot; Big Bang &quot; of 1986 , which de-regulated financial services , made risky behavior in the City the norm . 
These reforms sowed the seeds of the financial crisis of 2008 . 
The &quot; Victorian values &quot; that Thatcher sought to foster fell afoul of the unrestrained celebration of material wealth that her rule brought about . 
The moral society , based on decent self-interest , that Thatcher hoped to establish became the greedy society , based on coarse self-regard . 
If she experienced any retrospective doubt , she gave no sign of it .
