The Euro-American Debt Dilemma 
PALO ALTO - Wealthy Europe and America , crown jewels of mixed capitalist democracies , are drowning in deficits and debt , owing to bloated welfare states that are now in place ( Europe ) or in the making ( the United States ) . 
As Europe struggles to prevent financial contagion and America struggles to reduce its record deficits , their dangerous debt levels threaten future living standards and strain domestic and international political institutions . 
The ratings agencies are threatening additional downgrades ; others envision an eventual breakup of the euro and / or demise of the dollar as the global reserve currency . 
The economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart estimate that public debt / GDP ratios of 90 % are associated with sharply diminished growth prospects . 
Greece &apos;s debt ratio is over 120 % , Italy &apos;s is around 100 % , and the US is at 74 % , up from 40 % a few years ago - and rapidly approaching 90 % . 
The International Monetary Fund estimates that each 10-point increase in the debt ratio lowers economic growth by 0.2 percentage points . 
Thus , increases of 40-50 % of GDP risk cutting long-run growth in half in parts of Western Europe , and by one-third in America - a devastating reduction in gains in living standards over the course of a generation . 
Worse yet , the burden of banking losses that will sooner or later be socialized , and that of future unfunded public pension and health costs , are often understated in official debt figures . 
Moreover , the problematic finances of some sub-national governments , for example in the US and Spain , will place pressure on central governments for fiscal aid . 
In Europe , voters in fiscally responsible countries like Germany and the Netherlands are balking at bailouts of governments , banks , and bondholders . 
American voters traditionally have favored smaller government and lower taxes than Europeans have favored ( or at least tolerated ) . 
Add continued anger over financial bailouts , rising spending , and the exploding national debt , and even America &apos;s Democrats - the country &apos;s traditional big-spending party - are finally talking deficit reduction . 
Following the last deep American recession , in 1981-1982 , when the unemployment rate peaked at a higher level than in the recent recession , Democrats blasted President Ronald Reagan for deficits of 6 % of GDP . 
Republicans now berate President Barack Obama for deficits of 10 % of GDP . 
Similar political and substantive jockeying occurs in European countries . 
The simplistic categorization of political parties by their preference for a particular size of government masks more complex intraparty tendencies . 
America &apos;s Republican Party has three types of fiscal conservatives : supply-side tax-cutters , those who would limit government spending , and budget balancers . 
They historically have feuded over tactics and strategy , but , since the deficit is the difference between revenues and outlays , they are closely interconnected . 
Indeed , because the sum of all future tax revenues ( discounted to today ) must cover the sum of all future spending plus the national debt , the only way to keep taxes relatively low is to control spending . 
Just as Democrats have long championed more government spending , and more benefits for more people , either on ideological grounds or as a political coalition-building strategy , so Republicans have regarded the goal of lowering taxes . 
So , not surprisingly , Republicans are using the vote on the debt ceiling to force cuts in entitlement spending , while Obama and Congressional Democrats are using it to force higher taxes , in part to fracture their opponents &quot; coalition . 
High levels of debt combine with slow economic growth in a devilish dance . 
Interest payments on the debt eventually become so burdensome that bondholders demand higher interest payments ( Greek debt recently yielded over 30 % ) . 
Interest rates on US government debt remain low , so this threat is prospective , but future deficits will be far higher than government projections when rates normalize . 
The best response would be to enact strong controls on budgets , together with structural reforms to promote growth . 
In the US , which has the most progressive income tax among the major economies , federal tax reforms that would lower the rates and broaden the base are being discussed . 
In Europe , structural reforms focus on higher retirement ages and labor-market flexibility . 
The deleveraging of governments , financial institutions , and households is one major cause of the sluggish economic recovery . 
But sluggish growth means less tax revenue and more demands for payments to cushion hardship , placing pressure on government budgets . 
The gamble has been that a solid , durable recovery would enable banks and households to rebuild their balance sheets quickly enough to avoid the need for additional bailouts . 
But , so far , that gamble isn &apos;t working as well or as rapidly as hoped . 
Banks are profitable on an ongoing basis , borrowing at very low interest rates , often from the central bank , and collecting higher interest rates on their loans . 
But , while instantaneous mark-to-market accounting can overstate the expected losses during a panic , the current values are often an accounting and political fiction . 
Further action on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ( America &apos;s huge quasi-government mortgage agencies ) and on some weak banks in America , as well as on some of Europe &apos;s weaker , more thinly capitalized banks ( the recent stress tests were a tepid first step ) , will be necessary . 
Banking systems need more capital . 
The best solution is private capital - from retained earnings , new entrants , new ownership , and new investment . 
But in some cases , additional public capital probably cannot be avoided , as distasteful as it is . 
The debt dilemmas in Europe and the US prove yet again that elected officials will ignore long-run costs to achieve short-run benefits , and will act only when forced , in a doomed effort to circumvent the laws of economics and revoke the laws of arithmetic . 
And that implies an extended period of episodic economic disruption and political upheaval far beyond this summer &apos;s debates on America &apos;s debt ceiling and Europe &apos;s distressed sovereign debtors . 
These debates represent just one round in an ongoing struggle , with vast political and economic consequences for years to come .
