Should Europe be Fracking ? 
BRUSSELS - The global energy community is abuzz with excitement about hydraulic fracturing , or &quot; fracking , &quot; a newish technology that has opened formerly inaccessible reserves of gas trapped in underground shale formations . 
The boom in this so-called shale-gas production has allowed the United States to become almost self-sufficient in natural gas . 
Europe , by contrast , is clearly lagging . 
Exploration is proceeding only hesitantly and shale-gas production has not even started , prompting many observers to lament that Europe is about to miss the next energy revolution . 
Should Europeans be worried ? 
Critics of Europe &apos;s apparent lack of enthusiasm for fracking miss two key points . 
First , Europe &apos;s geology is different from that of America . 
There is a huge difference between potential deposits hidden somewhere in large shale formations and recoverable reserves that can actually be produced economically . 
In fact , estimates by the International Energy Agency suggest that the most significant recoverable reserves of shale gas are in the US and China , not Europe . 
Moreover , even these estimates are really not much more than educated guesses , because only in the US have shale formations been subject to intense exploration over a period of decades . 
This process is starting in Europe only now . 
Poland appears to have Europe &apos;s most favorable geology , and it might become a significant producer on a local scale in about ten years . 
This is a fortunate coincidence , because shale-gas production would probably make it politically easier to phase out Poland &apos;s economically and environmentally irrational subsidies to local coal production ( and consumption ) . 
Fracking would also be a strategic boon , because it would diminish the country &apos;s dependence on Russia for gas . 
But pro-fracking critics of the European Union miss a second point : the EU has no authority over the development of shale gas in Europe . 
Licensing and regulation of exploration and production are decided at the national level . 
One must admit , however , that in Europe the &quot; Nimby &quot; phenomenon ( not in my backyard ) is a much more serious obstacle than it is in the US . 
In particular , whereas ownership rights over natural resources in the US typically belong to the individual owner of the land under which the resources lie , in Europe ownership belongs to the state . 
As a result , Europeans , facing uncertain environmental consequences while receiving none of the revenues , tend to oppose fracking nearby . 
In the US , by contrast , local residents benefit handsomely from being able to sell their ownership rights to gas companies - a strong counter-balance to fears of environmental costs . 
But private versus state ownership of natural resources is not the only institutional factor underlying the US gas boom . 
Governments certainly have a role to play in supporting the development of new technologies , such as fracking ; but , once the technology has been developed , there is no reason why one form of gas production should be subsidized via tax breaks . 
But the most crucial - and almost always overlooked - point about fracking is that shale gas , like all hydrocarbons , can be used only once . 
The real issue is thus not whether shale gas should be developed in Europe , but when it should be used : today or tomorrow . 
Europe is already a heavy user of gas , but its consumption is stagnating ( along with its economy ) . 
Despite the hype about the shale-gas revolution , the extraction cost of ( onshore ) conventional gas remains below that of shale gas . 
Moreover , an existing pipeline network implies that this conventional gas can be brought to Europe at a low marginal cost . 
From an economic ( and environmental ) standpoint , fracking is thus unlikely to bring large benefits for Europe : shale gas might simply substitute for plentiful conventional gas . 
In an environment of ultra-low interest rates , the economic cost of being late is low . 
The best option for Europe might be to wait and let the market operate . 
Fracking is not yet a mature technology , and thus it is very likely to improve over time . 
Maybe Europe will become a leader in &quot; advanced fracking &quot; when the shale-gas deposits in the US have already been exhausted .
