Saudi Arabia &apos;s Pilgrimage to Pakistan 
LONDON - Over the last few years , Saudi Arabia has become increasingly estranged from its long-time protector , the United States . 
It viewed America &apos;s backing for Hosni Mubarak &apos;s fall from power in Egypt - and its subsequent acceptance of the Muslim Brotherhood government - as a betrayal . 
Then came US President Barack Obama &apos;s refusal to enforce his &quot; red line &quot; in Syria , after President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime unleashed poison gas on its opponents . 
But the final straw was America &apos;s support for the recent interim agreement on Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s mounting distrust of the US matters , because whenever the Kingdom has felt an existential threat - and it regards Iran &apos;s regional ambitions as such a threat - it has relied on an external power to protect it . 
But if it can no longer rely on the US , where can the Kingdom turn for sufficient military muscle ? 
The answer seems to be Pakistan , a country that the rest of the world views as on the verge of becoming a failed state . 
Pakistan has previously served the Kingdom &apos;s interests by sending military and security assistance during times of stress . 
Saudi Arabia received some 30,000 Pakistani soldiers in 1979 , at the time of Iran &apos;s Islamic Revolution . 
And these troops remained in the Kingdom until the mid-1980 &quot; s . 
The Saudis also employed thousands of Pakistani soldiers during the 1991 Gulf War . 
And , at the beginning of 2014 , Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal and Crown Prince Salman visited Islamabad to renew the two countries &quot; military agreements on joint arms production . 
The visit was also intended to lay the groundwork to bring 30,000 Pakistani soldiers and military advisers to the Kingdom . 
Why Pakistan , and why now ? 
The Saudi rulers view Pakistan as one of three regional powers , along with Iran and Turkey , capable of having a decisive impact on the Middle East . 
An alliance with Shia Iran - the Kingdom &apos;s supreme ideological enemy , and one with regional hegemonic ambitions - is out of the question . 
Turkey , for its part , is regarded as a competitor for the mantle of Sunni Muslim leadership - a position long held by the Ottoman Empire . 
The frequent description of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan as harboring &quot; neo-Ottoman &quot; ambitions for his country clearly implicates this rivalry . 
It was the Ottomans who brought down two historical Saudi / Wahhabi states . 
The first such state ( 1745-1818 ) was destroyed by Egypt &apos;s Mehmet Ali with Ottoman support ; the second ( 1824-1891 ) was also defeated by the Ottomans . 
By contrast , the Kingdom has no problematic history with Pakistan . 
On the contrary , the Saudis have bankrolled the Pakistani state , and proved a generous host to its current prime minister , Mian Nawaz Sharif , during his long exile following the military coup that toppled his government in 1999 . 
Indeed , Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in Pakistan since the early years of its independence . 
Given that Pakistan was founded in 1947 on a religious basis , it is not surprising that its leaders sought support from the source of Islam , Mecca , then under Saudi rule . 
The Kingdom , in turn , exported its Wahhabi teachings to the &quot; Land of the Pure , &quot; ultimately fueling the Islamic extremism and sectarian violence of the Taliban and others . 
Saudi Arabia also invested in Pakistan &apos;s nuclear weapons program , the so-called Sunni Bomb , by directly financing the research of A. Q. Khan , the father of the Pakistani effort . 
The Kingdom &apos;s hope of directly benefiting from Pakistan &apos;s nuclear capabilities was blocked in 2003 , when the US discovered the prospect of a transfer of knowledge and more . 
Moreover , the forces that the Pakistan has sent to the Kingdom over the years have been perceived as generally loyal . 
Although up to 30 % of the Pakistani army are Shia , the Saudis will only accept Sunni soldiers , and Pakistan has happily provided them as mercenaries , sent on rotation and treated as guest workers . 
Part of the Saudi plan today is to use Pakistanis as the backbone for a new Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) joint military force . 
Pakistani forces under Saudi command were used in operations to quell Shia uprisings in Bahrain in 2011 , and the Saudis now want a standby force ready to put down Islamist and Shia provocations whenever and wherever they may appear in the Gulf . 
In the event of an existential threat in the region , in particular a confrontation with Iran , Pakistan would offer the Kingdom a form of deadly protection denied it by the West . 
So to what extent can Pakistan really enhance Saudi Arabia &apos;s security , particularly in a war against Iran ? 
Pakistan is badly fractured , with domestic terrorism running rampant . 
Its military lacks the capacity to intervene in Saudi Arabia &apos;s defense while maintaining not only domestic security , but also readiness for war against India ( an obsession of Pakistani generals ) . 
Moreover , Pakistan &apos;s substantial Shia population might join the ranks of the violently disaffected if the military backed the Saudis in a sectarian war . 
And the Pakistan People &apos;s Party , now in opposition but still a powerful domestic force , shares interests with Iran . 
So , although the strategic value of closer military ties with Pakistan seems highly questionable , Saudi Arabia has little choice . 
The GCC is in fact disintegrating , following Qatar &apos;s ouster for supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and Oman &apos;s voluntary departure from the group . 
That , together with the Kingdom &apos;s deepening distrust of the US , is fueling a growing sense of isolation . 
Pakistan may not be anyone &apos;s idea of an ally when facing an existential threat ; for Saudi Arabia , however , it is an idea whose time has come .
