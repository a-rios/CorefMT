Inequality and Discontent 
In the last two decades , the world as a whole has gotten richer , but , while some national economies have advanced sharply , others have fallen farther behind . 
The increase in aggregate wealth has not led to the abolition , or even reduction , of poverty . 
Much the same is true within countries . 
Almost everywhere , globalization has produced both a new class of multi-millionaires and an underclass comprising people who are not just poor in the statistical sense of earning less than half the national average , but who are excluded from opportunities that are supposed to be open to all . 
Globalization &apos;s dynamism has benefited many , but it has also increased inequality . 
Is that necessarily a bad thing ? 
There are many who think so . 
In fact , entire countries have a built-in egalitarian streak . 
They dislike the business leaders who take home huge sums even when they fail , and they hate to see poor and excluded people in their midst . 
But , while it is comfortable to live in the social-democratic world of Scandinavia , Germany , and other European countries , many of them have purchased their equality on credit from future generations . 
Moreover , an egalitarian climate does not promote innovation and a sense of dynamic development . 
Creative individuals tend to leave societies in which there is strong pressure not to be different . 
Inequality is not merely compatible with freedom , but is often a result of and stimulus for freedom . 
Is that the choice we have to make then : freedom or equality ? 
Things are not quite so simple . 
A free society recognizes two limits to economic and general inequality . 
Both raise quite difficult practical questions , though they are clear in principle . 
Inequality is incompatible with freedom if it limits individuals &quot; chances of participation in the political community , in the market , and in civil society . 
At the lower end of the social scale , this raises the old and vexing question of equality of opportunity . 
What is clear is that everyone must have access to elections and political parties , to education and the labor market , and to the associations of civil society . 
In short , citizenship in the full sense of the word requires basic rights and the ability to enforce them . 
It also requires a basic economic status , including an income guarantee , which can be provided in a variety of ways . 
One difficult question is where , exactly , to draw the line that defines the basic status to which all citizens are entitled . 
In most countries , it should probably be higher than it is now . 
Another difficult question is how the basic status is to be guaranteed . 
The debate about individual income supplements versus general public services has become lively everywhere . 
It may well be resolved with different answers that accord with different countries &quot; traditions , although tax credits and similar additions to people &apos;s incomes are more compatible with free societies . 
At the upper end of the social and economic scale , a different issue arises . 
Many people object to business managers who take away in pay , bonuses , and stock options hundreds of millions of dollars from their companies . 
Indeed , there is a legitimate question whether the behavior of today &apos;s capitalists promotes the general acceptance of capitalism . 
When wealth turns into unchecked power , something must be done to restrict it . 
What has come to be called money laundering , that is , the attempt to turn illicit gains into legitimate riches , provides one example of the need for action . 
There are others , including the question of inheritance taxes , which have long been regarded as a necessary component of a free society . 
Nevertheless , while a free society recognizes limits to inequality , it also accepts that inequality exists , for it provides hope for many by showing what one might achieve with ability and luck - or perhaps even luck alone . 
Inequality adds color and variety to societies ; it is one of the marks of lively , flexible , and innovative countries . 
It is thus not bad in itself , even if its excesses must be capped in the name of citizenship for all . 
Social exclusion and personalized power through wealth are always unacceptable .
