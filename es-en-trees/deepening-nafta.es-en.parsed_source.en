Deepening NAFTA 
The good news about NAFTA is that there is little news about NAFTA . 
That quiet , so different from the protests that greeted the North American Free Trade Area &apos;s creation a decade ago , reflects NAFTA &apos;s clear achievement in facilitating and integrating economic exchange among its three partners . 
Next week &apos;s meeting between the Mexican and American presidents should take advantage of this success to push NAFTA forward in creative new ways . 
Luckily , a road map for NAFTA exists . 
When the then President-elect Vicente Fox of Mexico traveled to the United States and Canada in the fall of 2000 , he carried a bold proposal : after eight years it was time for Canada , the US and Mexico to establish a longer-term goal of creating a North American Community . 
Although his unorthodox suggestion met with skepticism , his ideas established an agenda that NAFTA &apos;s three partners should pursue . 
Why fix what is not broken ? 
Because , from Mexico &apos;s perspective , NAFTA has not yet achieved one of its key goals : to deliver the benefits of free trade to all of the country &apos;s regions and sectors . 
For NAFTA to realize its full potential and move the convergence process , opening borders to trade and reducing tariff barriers are not enough . 
Since its founding in 1994 , NAFTA has been characterized ( at best ) by a bilateral management of issues and problems . 
Too often , the US has taken a unilateral approach . 
Trilateral or sub-regional cooperation is our goal . 
As it stands , Mexico and Canada have been limited to dealing with the US on an individual basis because the three countries - for different reasons - prefer to keep separate bilateral links with their neighbors . 
The result of this is to neglect the overall North American perspective while giving preference to a domestic or bilateral vision that sometimes fails to promote the larger objective of integration . 
To promote a regional perspective , Mexico , Canada , and the US must consider establishing an institutional forum where such discussions can take place and where recommendations to governments can emerge . 
This is especially the case as the three countries assess the feasibility of common migration policies , border development and infrastructure , shared natural resources , environmental protection , economic and social policy coordination , and other issues of common concern . 
Several concrete proposals have been advanced on how to achieve this . 
At a minimum , a North American Commission or coordinating mechanism should be set up to begin the process . 
While the European Commission model may not be what NAFTA needs , the governments of Canada , Mexico , and the US should establish a permanent mechanism for channeling ideas and proposals , and transforming those ideas into action . 
One area ripe for an institutional mechanism is energy . 
North America shares one of the richest and most varied energy resource pools in the world . 
Having excluded energy from the original NAFTA talks , Canada and Mexico are now willing to engage with the US on a common energy strategy . 
Indeed , talks on the subject have taken place among ministers from the three countries . 
As each advances its domestic energy strategy , identifying synergies can help in rationalizing and making optimum use of what energy resources are available . 
Another example of the new regional agenda can be found in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11 th . 
Protecting North America and securing its borders has become a major priority in the fight against international terrorism and there must be a common response . 
Having created a functioning , regional , open trade area , the three countries must ensure that the new imperative to secure borders does not obstruct legitimate flows of goods , services and people . 
A NAFTA-wide security perimeter could transform internal borders in much the same way that the Schengen Agreement transformed borders within much of continental Europe . 
The re-casting of the bilateral agenda on migration between Mexico and the US , well underway prior to 9 / 11 , must be reconciled with America &apos;s new concept of homeland security . 
While some argue that the fight against terrorism is the natural enemy of regularizing migration , others agree that now more than ever the countries of North America need to address this issue trilaterally . 
Migration , security , energy , labor and the other issues that make up the North American agenda must be discussed , managed and implemented in trilateral bodies with the expertise necessary to identify , harmonize and eventually converge policy-making for the region . 
This requires greater communication between and among decision-makers in all three NAFTA members . 
The agenda and timetable for convergence must be set by NAFTA &apos;s elected leaders , but implementation should be in the hands of a new commission . 
Possible subjects for that commission &apos;s agenda include : financial , fiscal and customs harmonization ; transport infrastructure ; natural resources and regional development . 
There are , of course , many other issues , some of which already receive intensive cooperative efforts , especially in the fields of combating organized crime , drug and human trafficking , and the cross-border flow of contraband . 
In any case , problems need to be identified so that opportunities for cooperation are created . 
Today &apos;s challenge is to renew NAFTA by adding the concept of partnership to it . 
Although recognizing that much still divides us , major common goals do provide a solid foundation for future cooperation . 
All three countries now find themselves at a juncture favorable to building a North American Commission to address the needs of the North American Community . 
We should seize the moment and proceed with negotiations to create such a forum .
