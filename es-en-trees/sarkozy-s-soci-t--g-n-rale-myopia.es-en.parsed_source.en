Sarkozy &apos;s Société Générale Myopia 
SAN FRANCISCO  -  
&quot; Loose lips sink ships &quot; is received wisdom in central banking circles . 
But if President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s team in the Élysée Palace had had its way , Noyer would have immediately informed the government of Société Générale &apos;s troubles . 
Had that happened , there would have been an unacceptable risk that the news would leak to speculators before Société Générale had a chance to liquidate the extraordinary large stock positions that Jérôme Kerviel had amassed , presumably without the bank &apos;s knowledge . 
The loss for Société Générale could have been far higher than the € 5 billion it is reported to have incurred . 
Speculators could have &quot; front run &quot; the bank in the markets , selling short , driving equity prices down , and forcing the French financial institution to sell into a bottomless pit . 
Is a forced bankruptcy in extremely fragile global financial markets what the French government wanted for Société Générale ? 
How can President Sarkozy , who has repeatedly attacked financial speculators , question the judgment of the very man who , by knowing how to keep his mouth shut in a crisis , thwarted them ? 
Of course , independent central bankers are not Sarkozy &apos;s favorite people . 
According to Laurent Dubois , a political science professor at the Sorbonne in Paris , Noyer may pay for Sarkozy &apos;s battles with the European Central Bank . 
Sarkozy has &quot; a problem with central banks &quot; independence , &quot; and Noyer may become a &quot; scapegoat . &quot; 
Not likely - at least in the current political environment . 
Sarkozy &apos;s recent poll numbers have been dropping like a stone . 
According to the TNS Sofres poll for Le Figaro Magazine , Sarkozy &apos;s popularity tumbled a whopping eight percentage points in January , to just 41 % , the lowest level since he took office last May and down from a high of 65 % in July . 
Sarkozy , who during his electoral campaign vowed to be the &quot; president who delivers on purchasing power , &quot; now faces an angry French public whose primary complaint is that purchasing power is being eroded by inflation . 
In this changed political environment , Sarkozy is not likely to go after someone like Noyer who , as Bank of France Governor and a member of the ECB &apos;s Governing Council , is widely viewed as a stalwart against inflation and a defender of French purchasing power . 
Why risk a &quot; soft on inflation &quot; label ? 
Sarkozy might even tone down his attacks on the ECB , whose single-minded , inflation-fighting policies have made it one of his favorite targets . 
That would be a good thing . 
With Sarkozy off his back , ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet might feel freer to cut interest rates to counter the impending economic slowdown in Europe . 
Meanwhile , though Société Générale has been saved by Noyer &apos;s professionalism and political courage , it has been badly wounded and will most likely be taken over by another bank . 
A foreign takeover would raise French protectionist hackles . 
&quot; Société Générale will remain a great French bank , &quot; Prime Minister Francois Fillon has said . 
&quot; The government will not allow it to be the target of hostile raids by other banks . &quot; 
The problem is that the French government is barred from doing this under an EU directive that it signed last year , which was specifically introduced to improve transparency in banking mergers . 
After Italy &apos;s former central bank governor , Antonio Fazio , flagrantly abused his position to block a takeover of an Italian bank by ABN Amro , member countries agreed that future mergers would be assessed on five objective criteria , the idea being to prevent governments from blocking foreign bids purely for protectionist reasons . 
Noyer &apos;s diplomatic skill certainly will be put to the test if he has to navigate the treacherous waters between the Scylla of French protectionism and the Charybdis of the EU &apos;s five criteria for bank mergers . 
Foreign bank mergers have proved poisonous for euro-zone central bankers . 
So far , the only serious candidates to emerge for a Société Générale takeover are two French banks , Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas . 
But should a credible foreign offer for Société Générale appear in the coming weeks ­ - and it well might - another disruptive conflict between the Bank of France and the government may be in the offing . 
The Société Générale rogue trader scandal has caused more problems than any of the main players possibly could have imagined .
