A Global Solutions Network 
NEW YORK - Great social change occurs in several ways . 
A technological breakthrough - the steam engine , computers , the Internet - may play a leading role . 
Visionaries , such as Mahatma Gandhi , Martin Luther King Jr . , and Nelson Mandela , may inspire a demand for justice . 
Political leaders may lead a broad reform movement , as with Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal . 
Our own generation urgently needs to spur another era of great social change . 
This time , we must act to save the planet from a human-induced environmental catastrophe . 
Each of us senses this challenge almost daily . 
Heat waves , droughts , floods , forest fires , retreating glaciers , polluted rivers , and extreme storms buffet the planet at a dramatically rising rate , owing to human activities . 
Our $ 70-trillion-per-year global economy is putting unprecedented pressures on the natural environment . 
We will need new technologies , behaviors , and ethics , supported by solid evidence , to reconcile further economic development with environmental sustainability . 
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is taking on this unprecedented challenge from his unique position at the crossroads of global politics and society . 
At the political level , the UN is the meeting place for 193 member states to negotiate and create international law , as in the important treaty on climate change adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 . 
At the level of global society , the UN represents the world &apos;s citizenry , &quot; we the peoples , &quot; as it says in the UN Charter . 
At the societal level , the UN is about the rights and responsibilities of all of us , including future generations . 
In the past two decades , governments have come up short on solutions to environmental threats . 
Politicians have failed to implement properly the treaties adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit . 
Ban knows that strong government action remains vital , but he also recognizes that civil society must also play a larger role , especially because too many governments and politicians are beholden to vested interests , and too few politicians think in time horizons that extend past the next election . 
To empower global society to act , Ban has launched a bold new global initiative , for which I am grateful to volunteer . 
The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network is a powerful effort to mobilize global knowledge to save the planet . 
The idea is to use global networks of knowledge and action to identify and demonstrate new , cutting-edge approaches to sustainable development around the world . 
The network will work alongside and support governments , UN agencies , civil-society organizations , and the private sector . 
Humanity needs to learn new ways to produce and use low-carbon energy , grow food sustainably , build livable cities , and manage the global commons of oceans , biodiversity , and the atmosphere . 
But time is running very short . 
Agricultural regions already need to become more resilient in the face of increased climate volatility . 
And as one region in one part of the world designs a better way to manage its transport , energy needs , water supplies , or food supplies , those successes should quickly become part of the global knowledge base , enabling other regions to benefit rapidly as well . 
Universities have a special role to play in the new UN knowledge network . 
Exactly 150 years ago , in 1862 , Abraham Lincoln created America &apos;s &quot; land-grant &quot; universities to help local communities to improve farming and the quality of life through science . 
Today , we need universities in all parts of the world to help their societies face the challenges of poverty reduction , clean energy , sustainable food supplies , and the rest . 
By linking together , and putting their curricula online , the world &apos;s universities can become even more effective in discovering and promoting science-based solutions to complex problems . 
The world &apos;s corporate sector also has a significant role to play in sustainable development . 
Now the corporate sector has two faces . 
It is the repository of cutting-edge sustainable technologies , pioneering research and development , world-class management , and leadership in environmental sustainability . 
Sometimes the same company operates on both sides of the divide . 
We urgently need far-sighted companies to join the Sustainable Development Solutions Network . 
These companies are uniquely placed to move new ideas and technologies into early-stage demonstration projects , thereby accelerating global learning cycles . 
Equally important , we need a critical mass of respected corporate leaders to press their peers to cease the anti-environmental lobbying and campaign-finance practices that account for the inaction of governments . 
Sustainable development is a generational challenge , not a short-term task . 
The reinvention of energy , food , transport , and other systems will take decades , not years . 
We must start reinventing our productive systems now , precisely because the path of change will be so long and the environmental dangers are already so pressing . 
At the Rio + 20 Summit this past June , the world &apos;s governments agreed to adopt a new set of goals on sustainable development for the period after 2015 , to build upon the Millennium Development Goals &quot; success in reducing poverty , hunger , and disease . 
In the post-2015 era , the fight against poverty and the fight to protect the environment will go hand in hand , reinforcing each other . 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has already initiated several global processes to help establish the new post-2015 goals in an open , participatory , and knowledge-based way . 
The Secretary General &apos;s launch of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network is therefore especially timely . 
Not only will the world adopt a new set of goals to achieve sustainable development , but it will also have a new global network of expertise to help achieve those vital objectives .
