The Mauritius Miracle 
NEW YORK - Suppose someone were to describe a small country that provided free education through university for all of its citizens , transportation for school children , and free health care - including heart surgery - for all . 
You might suspect that such a country is either phenomenally rich or on the fast track to fiscal crisis . 
After all , rich countries in Europe have increasingly found that they cannot pay for university education , and are asking young people and their families to bear the costs . 
For its part , the United States has never attempted to give free college for all , and it took a bitter battle just to ensure that America &apos;s poor get access to health care - a guarantee that the Republican Party is now working hard to repeal , claiming that the country cannot afford it . 
But Mauritius , a small island nation off the east coast of Africa , is neither particularly rich nor on its way to budgetary ruin . 
Nonetheless , it has spent the last decades successfully building a diverse economy , a democratic political system , and a strong social safety net . 
Many countries , not least the US , could learn from its experience . 
In a recent visit to this tropical archipelago of 1.3 million people , I had a chance to see some of the leaps Mauritius has taken - accomplishments that can seem bewildering in light of the debate in the US and elsewhere . 
Consider home ownership : while American conservatives say that the government &apos;s attempt to extend home ownership to 70 % of the US population was responsible for the financial meltdown , 87 % of Mauritians own their own homes - without fueling a housing bubble . 
Now comes the painful number : Mauritius &apos;s GDP has grown faster than 5 % annually for almost 30 years . 
Surely , this must be some &quot; trick . &quot; 
Mauritius must be rich in diamonds , oil , or some other valuable commodity . 
But Mauritius has no exploitable natural resources . 
Indeed , so dismal were its prospects as it approached independence from Britain , which came in 1968 , that the Nobel Prize-winning economist James Meade wrote in 1961 : &quot; It is going to be a great achievement if &#91; the country &#93; can find productive employment for its population without a serious reduction in the existing standard of living .... &#91; T &#93; he outlook for peaceful development is weak . &quot; 
As if to prove Meade wrong , the Mauritians have increased per capita income from less than $ 400 around the time of independence to more than $ 6,700 today . 
The country has progressed from the sugar-based monoculture of 50 years ago to a diversified economy that includes tourism , finance , textiles , and , if current plans bear fruit , advanced technology . 
During my visit , my interest was to understand better what had led to what some have called the Mauritius Miracle , and what others might learn from it . 
There are , in fact , many lessons , some of which should be borne in mind by politicians in the US and elsewhere as they fight their budget battles . 
First , the question is not whether we can afford to provide health care or education for all , or ensure widespread homeownership . 
If Mauritius can afford these things , America and Europe - which are several orders of magnitude richer - can , too . 
The question , rather , is how to organize society . 
Mauritians have chosen a path that leads to higher levels of social cohesion , welfare , and economic growth - and to a lower level of inequality . 
Second , unlike many other small countries , Mauritius has decided that most military spending is a waste . 
The US need not go as far : just a fraction of the money that America spends on weapons that don &apos;t work against enemies that don &apos;t exist would go a long way toward creating a more humane society , including provision of health care and education to those who cannot afford them . 
Third , Mauritius recognized that without natural resources , its people were its only asset . 
Maybe that appreciation for its human resources is also what led Mauritius to realize that , particularly given the country &apos;s potential religious , ethnic , and political differences - which some tried to exploit in order to induce it to remain a British colony - education for all was crucial to social unity . 
So was a strong commitment to democratic institutions and cooperation between workers , government , and employers - precisely the opposite of the kind of dissension and division being engendered by conservatives in the US today . 
This is not to say that Mauritius is without problems . 
Like many other successful emerging-market countries , Mauritius is confronting a loss of exchange-rate competitiveness . 
And , as more and more countries intervene to weaken their exchange rates in response to America &apos;s attempt at competitive devaluation through quantitative easing , the problem is becoming worse . 
Almost surely , Mauritius , too , will have to intervene . 
Moreover , like many other countries around the world , Mauritius worries today about imported food and energy inflation . 
To respond to inflation by increasing interest rates would simply compound the difficulties of high prices with high unemployment and an even less competitive exchange rate . 
Direct interventions , restrictions on short-term capital inflows , capital-gains taxes , and stabilizing prudential banking regulations will all have to be considered . 
The Mauritius Miracle dates to independence . 
The US occupies one of Mauritius &apos;s offshore islands , Diego Garcia , as a naval base without compensation , officially leasing it from the United Kingdom , which not only retained the Chagos Islands in violation of the UN and international law , but expelled its citizens and refuses to allow them to return . 
The US should now do right by this peaceful and democratic country : recognize Mauritius &quot; rightful ownership of Diego Garcia , renegotiate the lease , and redeem past sins by paying a fair amount for land that it has illegally occupied for decades .
