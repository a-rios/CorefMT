Homelands for Plants 
DURHAM , NORTH CAROLINA - My day begins with a cup of coffee and ends with hot chocolate . 
In between , I consume a variety of food and medicines , including my daily 81mg dose of aspirin . 
A brightly colored orchid enlivens my study , and , through the window , I catch a glimpse of my green garden . 
In short , my life - like everyone &apos;s - is enabled , enriched , and extended by a wide variety of plants and their derivatives . 
But the biodiversity on which all of us depend is under threat , as human activity devastates forests and other plant-rich habitats . 
The question now is how quickly are species being destroyed - and what can be done to stop it . 
Designing effective conservation strategies must begin with knowledge of the species we need to protect . 
So far , taxonomists have described roughly 297,500 plant species . 
How many have they not yet described ? 
Where are we likely to find them ? 
It might seem that , as the pool of undescribed species diminishes , the rate at which taxonomists describe new species should decline . 
But the opposite has happened , with rates often increasing nearly exponentially from year to year - a phenomenon that can be explained largely by the growing number of taxonomists . 
Indeed , it is only the ratio of new species to taxonomists describing them that is declining . 
Based on this development , mathematical models predict that roughly 15 % more plant species exist than are currently known , for a total of some 350,000 species - a figure that is consistent with expert opinion . 
Perhaps half of the undescribed species have already been collected and housed in herbaria , where they await detection and analysis . 
To find the rest , taxonomists must rely on three general patterns governing species &quot; geographical distribution : 
· Most species have very small geographical ranges and are uncommon locally . 
· The number of species found in any one habitat varies considerably . 
Large tracts of boreal forest across North America and Eurasia have only a handful of tree species , while the Amazon basin may house 16,000 . 
· Species with small geographical ranges are often concentrated in the same areas , but they tend to be in areas different from where the largest numbers of species live . 
Based on these patterns , one could predict that most undescribed species have small geographical ranges and are scarce within them - that is why we have not found them yet . 
Moreover , they are likely to be located within known concentrations of species with small ranges , in areas like Central America , the Caribbean , the northern Andes , Brazil &apos;s coastal forests , southern Africa , Madagascar , Southeast Asia , New Guinea , Western Australia , and many tropical islands . 
Given that most plants that are currently threatened with extinction - 20 % of known species , and probably 30 % of all species - fall within this category , efforts to preserve plant biodiversity should emphasize such concentrations of small-range species . 
The fact that endangered plant species tend to be concentrated geographically raises the stakes for conservation efforts in those areas . 
But it could also facilitate success by enabling policymakers to focus on narrow areas instead of vast habitats . 
The nearly 200-member Convention of Biological Diversity - which embodies the global consensus on the need to protect ecological diversity - aims to do just that . 
The CBD &apos;s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity calls for the formal protection of at least 17 % of the most ecologically important terrestrial areas , while the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation seeks to protect 60 % of plant species . 
Given that some 67 % of plant species live entirely within the selected areas , and an additional 14 % live partly in these areas , this approach is highly promising . 
Moreover , while some 13 % of the world &apos;s land area is currently protected , only 14 % of the 17 % that contains the most plant species fall within the protected areas . 
In order to improve the CBD &apos;s chances of success , countries with higher concentrations of unique species need more robust protections . 
Given that many of these countries are in the developing world , the international community should support such efforts . 
The situation is complicated by the &quot; Noah &apos;s Ark &quot; effect : while a small total area can house many species , it may not be able to ensure their long-term sustainability . 
In other words , even if the aggregate size of all protected areas is large , the individual areas may not be large enough to support viable populations . 
The ecological questions involved - how much area countries should protect , and where - are not easy to answer ; doing so requires ever-deeper knowledge of plant species and their habitats . 
And translating those answers into action demands something that may be even more difficult to secure : strong and sustained political will .
