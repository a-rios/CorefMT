The Right Way to Beat Chinese Inflation 
WASHINGTON , DC - High inflation is threatening social stability in China , soaring from 3.3 % in March 2007 to 8.3 % in March 2008 . 
As a result , the People &apos;s Bank of China has raised interest rates substantially and increased banks &quot; reserve requirements . 
The trick for the Chinese government will be to quell inflation in a way that does not compromise its long-term goal of continued strong economic growth . 
The risks are high . 
China &apos;s accelerating inflation reflects a similar climb in its GDP growth rate , from the already high 11 % in 2006 to 11.5 % in 2007 . 
The proximate cause of price growth since mid-2007 is the appearance of production bottlenecks as domestic demand exceeds supply in an increasing number of sectors , such as power generation , transportation , and intermediate-goods industries . 
Sustained robust growth and rising aggregate demand have also caused production bottlenecks outside of China , most notably in the agricultural commodity and mining sectors , which have helped lift oil prices to more than $ 100 per barrel . 
Adding to these woes are two other inflationary factors : first , Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome ( PRRS , or &quot; blue-ear disease &quot; ) has been killing pigs - China &apos;s main meat source - nationwide , and , second , terrible storms in January reduced the supply of grain and vegetables . 
In these circumstances , continuing to raise borrowing costs would be a mistake . 
To be sure , the prolonged rapid increase in Chinese aggregate demand has been fueled by an investment boom , as well as a growing trade surplus . 
Thus , lowering inflation would require reducing the growth rate ( if not the level ) of these two demand components . 
But Chinese policymakers should focus more on reducing the trade surplus and less on reducing investment spending - that is , they should emphasize renminbi ( RMB ) appreciation over higher interest rates to cool the economy . 
A sizeable reduction in aggregate demand through RMB appreciation is achievable without being imprudent , because the current-account surplus in 2007 was 9.5 % of GDP . 
Investment ( especially in infrastructure in backward areas and social investments ) should not bear the brunt of the expenditure squeeze , because today &apos;s investment is also tomorrow &apos;s growth in production capacity ; and the production of more goods tomorrow would reduce inflation . 
Using RMB appreciation as the primary tool to fight inflation implies accepting a temporarily higher unemployment rate now in exchange for a permanently lower unemployment rate in the future . 
This is because manufactured exports are typically more labor-intensive than investment projects . 
As a result , a RMB1 billion reduction in exports would create more unemployment than a RMB1 billion reduction in investment spending . 
But tomorrow &apos;s capacity expansion from today &apos;s investment would mean a permanent increase in the number of jobs created from tomorrow onward . 
Nevertheless , China must be careful when implementing RMB appreciation . 
Policy makers should closely monitor potential changes in the economic conditions in the G-7 . 
A deep recession in the United States resulting from the sub-prime crisis would significantly lower Chinese exports and cut the prices of oil and other primary commodities . 
In that case , a large RMB appreciation undertaken now would be overkill . 
Moreover , the authorities should recognize that RMB appreciation is unlikely to reduce US-China trade tensions . 
Consider the experience of Japan-bashing in the 1980 &quot; s , when the Yen-Dollar end-year exchange rate plunged from 248 in 1984 to 162 in 1986 , and then to 123 in 1988 . 
While Japan &apos;s overall current-account surplus declined significantly , from 3.7 % of GDP in 1985 to 2.7 % in 1988 , the overall US current-account deficit only fell from 2.8 % of GDP to 2.4 % , because Japanese companies started investing in production facilities in Southeast Asia for export to the US . 
So Japan-bashing continued under a new guise : the additional demand that Japan must remove its &quot; structural impediments &quot; to import . 
In short , substantial RMB appreciation would reduce the bilateral US-China trade deficit and China &apos;s overall trade surplus significantly , but it would do little to reduce the overall US trade deficit . 
In the absence of a generalized appreciation of all Asian currencies and unchanged American policies , possibly only a deep recession could reduce the overall US current-account deficit . 
A stronger RMB can help only the overheated Chinese economy . 
And it has the virtue of doing so without hurting China &apos;s future production capacity .
