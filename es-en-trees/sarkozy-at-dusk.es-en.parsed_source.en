Sarkozy at Dusk 
PARIS - And the next French President will be ... the Socialist Party &apos;s candidate François Hollande . 
A month ago , any prediction uttered with such certainty would have sounded imprudent , if not foolish . 
Uncertainty prevailed . 
Four candidates dominated the competition , and no one would have dared to predict which two will make it to the second-round run-off . 
Indeed , the race looked more open than ever in recent memory . 
Suddenly , something happened - not an event in itself ( though it started with Hollande &apos;s first great public rally in mid-January ) , but rather something that may resemble an irresistible process that can be summarized as follows : a majority of the French want to punish a president who has fallen from their graces . 
They might not have dared to do so had they not found a reasonably credible alternative . 
Hollande , by appearing more sound and determined than most French voters thought he was , has given a voice ( and a face ) to a widespread desire to reject the incumbent , Nicolas Sarkozy . 
That is not to say that Hollande is charismatic . 
On the contrary , there remain lingering doubts about his gravitas , not to mention serious concerns about the realism or the wisdom of his program . 
From now on , the campaign appears set to be transformed into a classic left-right struggle , but with a major difference between the two main candidates &quot; strategies . 
Hollande wants to turn the presidential election into a referendum on Sarkozy , who , given his unpopularity , is seeking to frame the battle in terms of values and experience . 
Indeed , the essence of Sarkozy &apos;s campaign message has become : &quot; You might not like me personally ( you would be wrong , by the way , because I am not as you see me , and my experience in power has transformed me deeply ) , but you support my conservative values , because they represent what you really think . 
In a world that is changing so rapidly and brutally , you need stability and reassurance . 
I can give you that . &quot; 
By emphasizing the ideological divide between him and Hollande , Sarkozy is also being led to court , more openly than ever , the extreme-right electorate of Marine Le Pen &apos;s National Front , as if he sensed that she might not find enough signatures to qualify for a place on the ballot . 
This strategy may make sense in the first round , but , by attracting extreme-right voters in the first round , Sarkozy could lose the support of centrist voters in the run-off . 
They might be willing to vote for &quot; experience , &quot; but not for a &quot; Christian conservative &quot; who strays from humanistic values . 
In any case , one could argue that the French are being unfair toward their president . 
Sarkozy has had to confront exceptionally difficult circumstances , and his record is far from poor . 
At the beginning of his term , France was at the helm of the European Union , and he proved to be a skillful leader . 
Understanding the gravity of the economic crisis that erupted in 2008 , he reacted swiftly and with considerable energy . 
He has also launched a major and long-overdue reform of the pension system and higher education . 
He made the right choices in intervening in Côte d &apos;Ivoire and Libya . 
One could easily add more such examples . 
In brief , Sarkozy has sincerely tried to reform a deeply paralyzed country . 
Yet , barring a last-minute miracle - a major mistake by Hollande that wrecks his credibility , or a fresh bout of crisis that stokes voters &quot; desire for reassuring continuity at the top - Sarkozy appears condemned to be the second one-term president in the history of the Fifth Republic , following Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing . 
In 1981 , Giscard was defeated largely as a result of the &quot; betrayal &quot; of his former prime minister , Jacques Chirac , who ran against him . 
In 2012 , no one in Sarkozy &apos;s camp is betraying the president ( those who are trying , such as former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin , have received no support ) . 
It is Sarkozy himself who has betrayed the hopes of his supporters and consolidated the hostility of his opponents . 
Sarkozy did so mostly at the very beginning of his presidency , and he is likely to be punished for it in 2012 . 
He has changed for the better , but only up to a point , and clearly not enough for a majority of the French , who , according to recent public-opinion polls , simply cannot stand the idea of having him on their television screens for another five years . 
Of course , as former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to say , &quot; a week is a long time in politics , &quot; and Sarkozy will officially become a candidate only this week . 
Yet it will be extremely difficult , if not impossible , for him to prevent the upcoming election from becoming an emotional and negative referendum on his persona .
