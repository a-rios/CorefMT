The Age of Sustainable Development 
NEW YORK - A half-century ago , John F. Kennedy observed that , &quot; man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life . &quot; 
Those words speak to us today with special urgency . 
Our generation can indeed end the ancient scourge of extreme poverty . 
Yet it can also destroy the earth &apos;s life-support system through human-induced environmental devastation . 
By necessity , then , we have entered The Age of Sustainable Development . 
So I am enormously excited to be launching a free , global , online university course by the same name in January 2014 . 
( Those interested in joining the course can register here . ) 
I hope that people all over the world will join the course - and then join the generation-long quest to achieve sustainable development . 
Sustainable development is both a way of understanding the world and a way to help save it . 
As a method of understanding the world , sustainable-development practitioners study the interactions of the economy , the environment , politics , and culture and how they influence prosperity , social inclusion , and environmental sustainability . 
Students of sustainable development must therefore learn about a wide range of subjects , including economic development , education , health care , climate change , energy systems , biodiversity , and urbanization , among others . 
As a method of helping to save the world , sustainable development encourages a holistic approach to human well-being , one that includes economic progress , strong social bonds , and environmental sustainability . 
The challenges are becoming more urgent as the large and rapidly growing world economy causes massive environmental destruction , and as new technologies demand new skills . 
Young people without the appropriate training and skills are likely to find few opportunities for decent jobs and incomes . 
I predict that sustainable development will become the organizing principle for our politics , economics , and even ethics in the years ahead . 
Indeed , the world &apos;s governments have agreed to place it at the very center of the world &apos;s post-2015 development agenda . 
They will soon adopt Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , which will help guide the world to a safer and fairer twenty-first-century trajectory . 
Just as the Millennium Development Goals , adopted in 2000 , have proved highly effective in the fight against poverty and disease , the SDGs ( which will succeed the MDGs in two years ) promise to address the global challenges that we face in areas including energy , food , water , climate , and jobs . 
I also believe that global , free , online teaching about sustainable development can help to propel global solutions . 
Online global courses are part of the world &apos;s ongoing information revolution - a revolution that is now fundamentally reshaping higher education , most importantly by creating new avenues of access for more people around the world . 
I know this from personal experience . 
For most of my years as a professor , the basic educational technologies did not change much . 
I stood in front of a class and gave a 57-minute lecture . 
Yes , the blackboard gave way to an overhead projector , and then to PowerPoint , but otherwise the basic classroom &quot; technology &quot; changed little . 
Yet , with the new information technologies , higher education ( and of course education at other levels ) is suddenly changing . 
Courses can now incorporate a lot more information - data , videos , and even live chats with experts halfway around the world . 
More and more people worldwide can access free , high-quality educational materials that previously were available only to a lucky few . 
This is especially important today , because the challenges of sustainable development will require knowledgeable and educated citizens everywhere . 
According to recent data , online university courses have already reached students in more than 190 countries , enabling them to watch lectures , take quizzes , and interact with fellow students and professors . 
Online education is transforming the classroom experience as well . 
Now , rather than watch me lecture for 57 minutes , my students at Columbia University can watch the online lectures ahead of time , permitting a much richer , in-depth discussion in the classroom . 
In the years ahead , I believe that all of us will have to become leaders in sustainable development in our homes , communities , and countries . 
Millions of young people will soon have to help solve problems of climate change , water , energy , transportation , and education . 
Thousands of cities and 200 countries around the world will need to rally all stakeholders - government , communities , experts , business , and non-governmental organizations - to play their roles , and open online education will be key to disseminating the information they need . 
For these reasons , I am also pleased that my course will be part of a more general education program of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network , an initiative under the auspices of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that I am honored to direct . 
The SDSN mobilizes scientific and technical expertise from academia , civil society , and the private sector in support of sustainable-development problem solving at local , national , and global scales . 
One of the SDSN &apos;s key objectives is to reach students all over the world by developing and disseminating online materials for sustainable-development curricula . 
More than a dozen institutions have already committed to incorporating The Age of Sustainable Development into their own classes , tailored for their own local circumstances and issues . 
The SDSN will encourage the world &apos;s universities to participate in the new era of global online teaching . 
The goal will be to equip today &apos;s young people to use wisely the power that will soon pass into their own hands to help address the world &apos;s great challenges .
