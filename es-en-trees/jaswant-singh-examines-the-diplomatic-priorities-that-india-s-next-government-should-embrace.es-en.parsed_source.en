India &apos;s Next Foreign Policy 
NEW DELHI - Next month , India will complete its marathon election . 
A new government is expected to assume power at the end of May , and , if the polls prove correct , the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , which has named Narendra Modi as its prime ministerial candidate , will lead that government . 
With India &apos;s sluggish economic performance having rightly dominated the campaign , the question of what foreign policy the new government should pursue remains unanswered . 
Whatever the specifics , one imperative is clear : India must move beyond its allegiance to the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) . 
The muddle that NAM diplomacy causes is perhaps best reflected in the Congress-led Indian government &apos;s recent quasi-endorsement of Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea . 
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his government appear to have overlooked that China covets Indian territory and may thus be pleased that Russia has set a precedent for a powerful country to thumb its nose at international law and seize part of a neighboring country . 
It is as if Indian foreign policy has been on autopilot since the 1980 &quot; s , when the government almost always adopted a pro-Russia stance . 
The reality is that the NAM was never particularly effective at keeping India out of conflict , as the wars with China and Pakistan in 1962 , 1965 , and 1971 clearly demonstrated . 
In 1971 , it was the Soviet Union &apos;s support , rather than that of the NAM , that helped India to overcome the refugee crisis caused by Pakistan &apos;s genocide in Bangladesh . 
Likewise , in 1999 , India relied on American intervention to pressure Pakistan to end its aggression around the Himalayan town of Kargil . 
Given this track record , how can old NAM diplomacy be expected to resolve the foreign-policy challenges that India faces , especially at a time when China and Pakistan are uniting to confront India ? 
The most pressing threat to India &apos;s peace lies on its borders , especially the Himalayan border with China , the world &apos;s longest disputed frontier - not least because uncertainty there facilitates inflows of terrorist forces bent on undermining India &apos;s territorial integrity and sowing seeds of ethnic and religious conflict . 
While India has fought terrorism longer than any other country , the problem now affects the entire region , including Afghanistan , China , and Pakistan . 
With Islamist terrorism spilling across its borders , India can no longer leave the turmoil in the Arab world to others to manage . 
Instead , it must take an active role in efforts to contain and ameliorate it - and that means developing new strategic alliances . 
Just as terrorists have created a kind of multilateral offensive , the countries that they threaten must construct a multilateral defense . 
For starters , India should welcome - and foster - the thaw in relations between the US and Iran . 
Given that both countries are friends of India , and that all three share many strategic interests , a nimble Indian government has an opening to help facilitate a diplomatic rapprochement . 
Meanwhile , a strategic alliance that supports peace in the Indian and Pacific Ocean region - for example , among India , the US , Japan , South Korea , Australia , and Vietnam - could be shaped quietly and calmly , without impeding any of the partners &quot; ability to establish economic ties with third parties , including China . 
India must also work vigorously to renew its relationships in Southeast Asia , where it risks abandoning the field to China . 
At the same time , India must develop a strategic understanding with China , Russia , and the US concerning the jihadist explosion in Pakistan , Afghanistan , and the Central Asian countries . 
Such an understanding would , of course , have rough edges , with India , Russia , and China simultaneously competing for influence in Afghanistan . 
Nonetheless , some sort of accord , whatever its gritty nuances , is both possible and necessary , given that preventing Afghanistan from relapsing into civil war or again becoming an export base for terrorism is in everyone &apos;s interest , including Pakistan &apos;s . 
India &apos;s next government must also nurture the country &apos;s partnership with the US . 
Until recently , the bilateral relationship has tended to be guided by a transatlantic , trans-Eurasian perspective , while ignoring the trans-Pacific option . 
But India , blocked to its west by Pakistan , is increasingly looking east for trade and strategic partnerships . 
As it explores these possibilities , it can work with the US to shape a common perspective in Central Asia . 
As for Pakistan , India &apos;s NAM-driven inaction has given its nemesis the upper hand in isolating India strategically . 
This is extraordinary , given that Pakistan is the region &apos;s principal protector of terrorist forces - and has now , sadly , become the victim of its home-grown militants . 
America &apos;s withdrawal from Afghanistan will , in the short run , be a setback for the entire region . 
But , even as the US withdraws its infantry , it cannot ignore the threat that Islamist terror poses to America . 
That is why the US will increasingly depend on countries like India to ensure the success of its global anti-terror policy . 
But the value of the bilateral relationship extends far beyond the war on terror . 
The US and India must also establish clear channels for technology transfer - military , industrial , and scientific , including with regard to space . 
Any forward movement in US-India cooperation must be characterized by care and respect , with objectives that are unambiguous , practical , and achievable . 
If both governments devote the necessary time and energy to each other , they can create a partnership between the world &apos;s two largest democracies capable of playing a key stabilizing role in South Asia and beyond .
