Jumping Viruses 
Scientists long anticipated that an influenza virus will spread - as now appears to be happening in Asia - from wild birds to humans , causing a pandemic . 
Prior to 2003 , coronaviruses ranked very low on the scale of important human diseases , mostly being associated with the common cold . 
But we have long known that coronaviruses can cause dreadful diseases in domestic animals . 
We simply haven &apos;t learned our lesson . 
Indeed , events of the last couple of decades - the AIDS viruses transferring from monkeys to man , followed by their global spread , being just one example - should have convinced us that , where diseases are concerned , the unexpected will happen . 
After all , the &quot; jumping &quot; of viruses from wild animals to humans is more common than we like to think . 
All types of virus strains or variants exist - somewhat akin to dogs existing as different breeds . 
Veterinarians and farmers have long known of a coronavirus that can kill 90 % or more of young pigs . 
Less well known is the fact that cats and dogs are infected by a coronavirus that can also cause disease in pigs . 
The cat coronavirus can cause lethal abdominal disease in cats , while some strains of the chicken coronavirus cause kidney disease rather than just bronchitis . 
There is simply no room for complacency where viruses - or bacteria , for that matter - are concerned . 
Evolution - whether of microbes or humans - involves pushing at the margins , going a little bit further than yesterday or last year , driven by the need to find additional sources of food . 
Humans , unlike other creatures , may also 
As we come close to other animals , their viruses come closer to us . 
The outcome can be the same if we trap , enclose , and trade wild animals , such as civet cats , which seems to be the scenario that led to SARS in humans . 
When a virus has been associated with its host for a very long time , it mutates to a form that grows well without killing its host , which would be a pointless outcome from an evolutionary standpoint . 
A well-understood example is that of influenza viruses in wild fowl , where the virus causes infections that are hard to detect . 
But if an influenza virus jumps from , say , ducks to chickens , there may be lethal consequences . 
The virus is not well adjusted to the chicken , and some strains of the virus &quot; go berserk . &quot; 
It is possible that the SARS coronavirus does not cause serious disease in its natural , wild animal hosts . 
Our problem arose when we enabled the virus to move from its normal home into us , by &quot; farming &quot; civet cats and other animals . 
Many human viral diseases have not been with us very long , perhaps only ten to twenty thousand years . 
Most probably , the viruses came from the wild animals in whose environment we were encroaching . 
In other words , the SARS outbreak was not a novel event . 
Chinese researchers have detected antibodies to SARS-like viruses in 2 % of people from whom blood samples were taken in 2001 - a year before the disease first occurred . 
Many animal traders tested in 2003 in a market in the epicenter of the SARS outbreak also had the antibodies - again with no history of disease . 
The difference in late 2002 was , perhaps , that people were infected with a variant that &quot; went berserk &quot; and grew too extensively in humans . 
It was bad luck . 
It is also possible that - again by chance - a benign SARS virus from a civet cat mutated 
Both aspects of this scenario - a virus jumping to a strange host and then mutating to a devastating form - are familiar . 
Waterfowl commonly spread influenza viruses to chickens , although the outcome usually is not serious . 
On occasion , however , the virus mutates to a lethal form that can kill almost 100 % of its victims . 
It is a highly virulent influenza virus such as this that is devastating chickens in parts of Asia . 
That influenza virus has also &quot; jumped &quot; from the chickens to those who look after them , killing some people . 
The influenza viruses established in humans for several decades originated from bird viruses . 
The chronic fear of health authorities is that , by chance , another avian influenza virus will mutate and spread from person to person to spawn a global pandemic . 
Human SARS might never have spread to the extent that it did ( killing 800 people and devastating economies ) if the problem had been openly acknowledged , with the World Health Organization involved from the outset . 
Similar failings have exacerbated the consequences of today &apos;s bird-origin influenza epidemic in Vietnam , Thailand , and elsewhere . 
Some countries that have the greatest reservoirs of viruses with &quot; jump potential &quot; are ill equipped politically , socially , and institutionally for the world to have confidence in them . 
Humans will continue to push against our existing boundaries , whether out of necessity , curiosity , pleasure , or greed , so more virus jumps will undoubtedly occur . 
We must trust the WHO and its associates to come to our rescue , as it did so admirably with SARS . 
But those involved in human and veterinary medicine must no longer remain aloof from one another . 
Recent events have made crystal clear what we already knew - that human and animal viruses are not mutually exclusive .
