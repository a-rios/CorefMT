Europe \ u0027s Overdue Reformation 
War and its huge cost ; the falling dollar ; mounting trade and budget deficits ; the chicanery that hollowed out companies like Enron and WorldCom ; the bursting of the high-tech bubble : capitalism American-style is both under strain and under a cloud . 
From left to right , many European intellectuals think that the capitalist game as played by the US is pass√© . 
An active search is on for new models . 
Strong on rhetoric and fueled by a wave of anti-Americanism , that search is nonetheless thin on facts . 
But it is facile to jump from individual corporate scandals to broad conclusions about the supposed rottenness of the American economy . 
A close look at productivity growth ( output per hour worked ) in the US and Europe shows that US capitalism remains as vital than ever . 
Having grown at an average annual rate of just 1.6 % since the early 1970 &apos;s , annual US productivity growth in the non-farm business sector has accelerated to an average of 2.6 % in the seven years since 1995 , with no sign of a slowdown . 
In 2002 , productivity grew by 4.8 % - an extraordinary result , because productivity normally falls during economic slowdowns . 
Now look at Europe . 
Annual productivity growth actually slackened in the second half of the1990 &apos;s , from 2.5 % to just 1.3 % today . 
This productivity gap is often attributed to the &quot; New Economy &quot; that emerged in the late 1990 &apos;s . 
True , many new technologies were developed and first applied in the US . 
So there must be other differences . 
Two candidates stand out : attitudes toward work and corporate governance . 
Six OECD countries do better than America in terms of output per hour worked : Norway , Belgium , France , Ireland , the Netherlands , and Germany . 
But the rankings change if you make output per capita ( a better measure of a country &apos;s economic well-being ) the standard : here the US comes first , and France and Germany drop , respectively , to 16th and 11th place . 
The reason for examining output per person rather than output per hour worked is simple : what determines a nation &apos;s wealth is how much each person works , and how many people work . 
This is where the US overtakes Europe : fewer people work in Europe than in the US , and those in Europe who do work don &apos;t work as much . 
Annual hours worked in the US are about 1800 , about 1500 in France , and 1400 in Germany . 
One reason why Europeans work less is because they pay more taxes , and high taxes are necessary to support those who do not work - an obvious vicious circle . 
But something deeper is at work . 
Perhaps the Europeans are perfectly happy to work less and enjoy more free time , both in terms of having more vacations during their working age , and spending less time in the active labor force . 
This is a legitimate choice , but once made , Europeans should stop looking for scapegoats for slow growth . 
For the source of the problem is neither the European Central Bank , nor the Stability Pact . 
Europe grows less because it works less - and it should not be surprised if a number of so-called &quot; developing countries &quot; soon catch up with Europe in terms of income per capita . 
The availability of new technologies is a necessary , but by no means sufficient , condition to raise a country &apos;s standard of living , because there must also be companies that are able to make use of them . 
In the early 20th century , it took over twenty years for the electrical engine to transform the textile industry . 
New machines were available , but firms were not prepared to use them . 
To do so required a change in work practices and in the way firms were run . 
Unions opposed such change , but it also took time for bosses to understand that the way they ran their plants needed to change . 
The new economy arrived after a decade of deep transformation within US companies . 
During the 1980 &apos;s , a wave of leveraged buyouts transformed US corporate culture , evidently making bosses more receptive to technological innovation . 
Not so in Europe , where the interests of a company &apos;s employees and their unions often come before those of its shareholders . 
Indeed , at one European newspaper , articles that arrived via e-mail were re-typed by typographers : the technology for transferring them electronically was available , but not the work rules to allow the paper to apply it . 
Unions are not the only culprits . 
Many European firms have complex ownership structures , with large shareholders whose interests often conflict with those of the company - hardly the best way to take sound business decisions . 
This is particularly true in finance and banking . 
Whatever the corporate horror stories in US banks , almost no European investment bank remains , and Germany is seriously considering a state-owned &quot; bad bank &quot; to bail out its all-powerful banking giants . 
If Europe wants to work less , it must be extraordinarily productive when it does work if it is to keep up with the hard-working Americans . 
That is why Europeans should hope that the wave of corporate restructuring and reformation , which many thought would follow inevitably in the wake of the creation of the single market , begins to crest across the Continent and change the way businesses are run .
