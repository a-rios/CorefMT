Dialogue or Disaster 
WASHINGTON , DC - China &apos;s President Hu Jintao will start a four-day visit to the United States on January 18 . 
Although Hu has been on several &quot; working visits &quot; to Washington , his upcoming trip will be his first official &quot; state visit &quot; since becoming president eight years ago . 
Given the great importance that China has traditionally attached to formalities , the Chinese government is repeatedly emphasizing that fact - and thus demonstrating its high expectations for the event . 
China has made an enormous effort to manage every detail of the summit . 
Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi was sent to Washington last week to apply the final touches to the preparations . 
China also resumed high-level bilateral military exchanges , which it suspended a year ago to protest US arms sales to Taiwan . 
Secretary of Defense , was warmly welcomed by Hu and other Chinese leaders days before the Washington summit . 
He even toured the People &apos;s Liberation Army &apos;s missile corps . 
Obviously , China wants to cultivate a pleasant atmosphere for Hu &apos;s state visit . 
Most of the meeting &apos;s agenda will be the same as at previous Sino-US summits . 
President Barack Obama will likely raise issues such as the bilateral trade imbalance , the Chinese government &apos;s manipulation of the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate , prevention of nuclear proliferation , recent tension on the Korean peninsula , international cooperation on climate change , and China &apos;s poor human rights record . 
Hu &apos;s reactions to Obama will also be familiar . 
China will blame the trade imbalance on America &apos;s ban on high-tech exports to China , deny engaging in currency manipulation , call on the US and its allies in East Asia to negotiate with North Korea without preconditions , insist on China &apos;s entitlement as a developing country to an exemption from emissions caps on CO2 , and refute criticism of its human rights record . 
While neither side is likely to change its current position significantly , a new subject will probably arise at the meeting : China &apos;s growing military power , and its influence on the Asian and Pacific region . 
Just as China has replaced Japan as the world &apos;s second largest economy , so its military might has grown rapidly in recent years . 
As a result , the US , as the world &apos;s strongest military power , wants to put bilateral military relations on the upcoming meeting &apos;s agenda , along with bilateral economic relations and international political affairs . 
Gates raised this issue during his recent talks with his Chinese counterpart , Liang Guanglie , proposing a mechanism for &quot; strategic dialogue &quot; between US and Chinese military forces , aimed at avoiding potential conflicts that might be caused by mutual misunderstanding and mistrust . 
Obama will surely raise the issue again at the upcoming summit . 
But China &apos;s attitude towards Sino-US military dialogue remains uncertain . 
Despite its resistance to a strategic military dialogue with the US , it seems to crave America &apos;s attention to its growing military might . 
A few days before Gates &apos;s visit , official Chinese media published a photo of the J-20 Black Eagle , a fifth generation stealth , twin-engine fighter aircraft made in China . 
The media also reported the development of the Dong Feng 21D ballistic missile , described as an &quot; aircraft carrier killer . &quot; 
From America &apos;s point of view , China &apos;s rapidly growing military power and lack of transparency have become grave concerns . 
In recent years , China has become increasingly assertive in its territorial disputes with Japan and other countries around the South China Sea . 
Indeed , Chinese leaders claim the South China Sea and the Yellow Sea as &quot; core &quot; national interests and openly express displeasure at the presence of US naval forces in these waters . 
China &apos;s behavior clearly shows its determination to become a regional power - indeed , the only military power in the region . 
Given the strength and depth of America &apos;s alliances within the Asia-Pacific region , tension between US and Chinese military forces has risen . 
China believes that it has a legitimate right to increase its military power , given its need to protect its expanding economic interests , which include secure sea routes for the transport of energy and other goods . 
The suspicions of China &apos;s neighbors , and their moves to establish closer military relations with the US , have made the Chinese government increasingly anxious and frustrated . 
At the same time , growing nationalist sentiment has put huge pressure on the government to be more aggressive and confrontational . 
Putting strategic military dialogue on the US-Sino agenda benefits both sides . 
For China , it is a symbol of recognition and respect as a regional military power . 
And , on a practical level , frequent and regular high-level military exchanges between the US and China would greatly increase mutual confidence and trust at a time when their divergent interests might otherwise lead to conflict . 
History shows that a rising military power will inevitably clash with an existing military power if they do not have regular , effective dialogue . 
In that case , China &apos;s claim to a peaceful rise would ring hollow . 
China , the Asia-Pacific region , and the world would suffer greatly as a result .
