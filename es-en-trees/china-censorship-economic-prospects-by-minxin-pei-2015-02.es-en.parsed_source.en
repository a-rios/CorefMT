China &apos;s War on Western Values 
CLAREMONT - The news from China these days is mostly depressing , owing to the government &apos;s escalating crackdown on its critics . 
But what few observers - particularly economic analysts - seem to understand is that the Chinese leadership &apos;s fight against liberalism and &quot; Western values &quot; is directly undermining its efforts to root out official corruption , promote innovation and entrepreneurship , and deepen engagement with the outside world . 
The regime &apos;s retrograde politics will have serious consequences for China &apos;s continued economic development . 
For starters , the government has intensified its censorship of the Internet , rendering popular portals and sites - including Google , Facebook , and the New York Times - all but inaccessible . 
Moreover , prominent human-rights lawyers have been jailed ; the well-known free-speech advocate Pu Zhiqiang , for one , has already been held for over six months , while prosecutors attempt to build a case against him . 
Meanwhile , senior Chinese officials have taken to enforcing political discipline within the Chinese Communist Party . 
Last June , Zhang Yingwei , Head of the CCP &apos;s discipline inspection office at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ( CASS ) , said that the institution - China &apos;s most prestigious government-run think tank - had been &quot; infiltrated by foreign forces &quot; and &quot; was conducting illegal collusion at politically sensitive times . &quot; 
Zhao Shengxuan , Vice President and Deputy Party Chief of CASS , responded by pledging that the Academy would &quot; treat political discipline as a criterion of the utmost importance in the assessment of academics . &quot; 
Soon after , CASS President Wang Weiguang thundered in an essay that class struggle would never be extinguished in China . 
Chinese academia more broadly has been the regime &apos;s chief target in its search for enemies , with universities dismissing professors for espousing &quot; seditious &quot; ideas like constitutionalism . 
In a particularly egregious case , an official newspaper in Liaoning province dispatched reporters disguised as students to college classrooms to catch professors criticizing the regime . 
A recent pronouncement by China &apos;s education minister , Yuan Guiren , threatens to do damage on a far larger scale . 
Yuan has vowed never to allow textbooks &quot; promoting Western values &quot; - especially those that &quot; attack or defame the leadership of the Party or smear socialism &quot; - into Chinese classrooms . 
Given Yuan &apos;s position , this pledge could effectively amount to official policy . 
One hopes , for China &apos;s sake , that it does not . 
The recent onslaught against free speech and Western values reflects the central political challenge facing President Xi Jinping , who must transform a one-party system enfeebled by greed and mistrust into a well-ordered , ideologically united regime capable of carrying out market-based reforms and sustaining its own long-term survival . 
A crackdown on liberalism , he seems to believe , will work alongside his anti-corruption campaign to advance this goal . 
This vision is as intellectually flawed as it is impractical . 
However hard one tries , it is virtually impossible to root out corruption in a one-party system without press freedom , a robust civil society , or the rule of law . 
Yet these are precisely the &quot; Western values &quot; that CCP apparatchiks are attempting to eliminate . 
China will pay dearly for this mistake . 
Consider the impact of Yuan &apos;s textbook campaign on China &apos;s 28 million college undergraduates , who would be left with substandard course materials . 
How could these students be expected to compete in the global economy , when their education has been compromised in this way ? 
The current trend implies deteriorating conditions for their teachers as well , particularly in the social sciences and humanities , as academics face tighter restrictions on scholarly exchanges with the West . 
With fewer opportunities to attend conferences abroad , publish papers in Western academic journals , or spend time teaching or conducting research outside of China , their professional development and careers could be severely impaired . 
As a result , the government &apos;s suppression of &quot; Western values &quot; - not to mention its relentless war on the Internet - is likely to spur an exodus of the country &apos;s best and brightest . 
In 2013 , an unprecedented 413,900 Chinese studied abroad - and the figure is expected to be even higher for 2014 . 
Of those , 90 % chose to study in Western countries ( plus Japan ) . 
To be sure , only a small fraction of college-age Chinese students attend universities overseas . 
Indeed , the number of students who went abroad in 2013 was equivalent to only 6 % of the students admitted to Chinese universities . 
But China &apos;s ruling elite , far from writing off this group as the price of its long-term survival , is leading the rush to the exits - largely sending its children to the Ivy League and Oxbridge . 
One wonders whether CCP leaders worry that their offspring will be brainwashed by Western values ; they evidently already are reluctant to send their children to local universities . 
And , if Yuan has his way , China &apos;s universities would increasingly look like their North Korean counterparts , rather than world-class Western institutions . 
That would have far-reaching - and devastating - consequences . 
The tens of millions of students who remain in China would not gain the knowledge and skills needed to maintain , much less improve , the economy &apos;s global competitiveness . 
Indeed , given that innovation is critical to China &apos;s continued economic development - a point that Xi has repeatedly emphasized - a war against Western influence in Chinese education is downright irrational . 
Unless the government &apos;s crackdown ends soon , Xi &apos;s &quot; Chinese dream &quot; of national greatness and prosperity will turn into a nightmare of accelerating decline and increasing backwardness . 
One way or the other , the war on Western values is a war that China can only lose .
