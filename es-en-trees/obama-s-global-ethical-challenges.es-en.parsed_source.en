Obama &apos;s Global Ethical Challenges 
PRINCETON - The astonishing story of Barack Obama &apos;s election as president has already done much to restore America &apos;s global image . 
In place of a president whose only qualification for the office was his father &apos;s name , we now have one whose intelligence and vision overcame the formidable obstacle of being the exotically named son of an African Muslim . 
Who would have believed , after the last two elections , that the American public was capable of electing such a candidate ? 
Obama &apos;s achievement raises the stakes for his first term in office . 
He campaigned on the theme that he is different from other politicians and will deliver real change . 
That appeal drew large and enthusiastic crowds , which , together with astute use of the Internet , gained him an unprecedented four million donors , and induced a huge number of African-Americans and young people to register to vote . 
This is the chance of a lifetime to break through the cynicism that has pervaded American politics for decades . 
But if Obama fails to make good on his promise of change , it will be decades before the electorate again places its trust in a candidate who claims to be different from the usual run of politicians . 
Many Americans will judge the new administration by what it does at home . 
That includes raising taxes on those earning more than $ 250,000 a year , and using the money to extend health insurance to the tens of millions of Americans who - uniquely for an industrialized nation - do not have it . 
He has also pledged tax cuts for medium and lower-paid workers , and improvements to America &apos;s education system . 
Keeping those promises despite America &apos;s gloomy economic prospects will not be easy . 
The biggest impact that Obama can make , however , is beyond America &apos;s borders . 
Last year , when speaking to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs , he called for a president who can speak directly to everyone in the world who longs for dignity and security , and say : &quot; You matter to us . 
Your future is our future . 
And our moment is now . &quot; 
Indeed , it is now . 
If Obama is to be that president , he should begin by keeping his promises to close the prison camp at Cuba &apos;s Guant√°namo Bay and to end the Bush administration &apos;s practice of locking people away without ever telling them why or what they are charged with . 
He must also begin the process of withdrawing combat troops from Iraq , a task that he said would be completed in 16 months . 
Keeping these promises will be significant steps towards restoring America &apos;s image around the world . 
Playing a constructive role in bringing about reform at the United Nations is also vital . 
The structure of the Security Council is 60 years old . 
It still gives the victors of the Second World War permanent membership of the Council , and a veto over its decisions . 
To change that will inevitably dilute the privileges of those nations , including the United States . 
But if any US president can overcome that historical shadow hanging over the UN , Obama can . 
Given that Obama has a Kenyan father and has spent time in the African villages where his kin still live , it is no surprise that he understands the need for rich nations to assist developing nations . 
Last year , he pledged to double US foreign aid by 2012 , raising it to $ 50 billion a year . ( That still leaves the US lagging behind many European nations in the percentage of its national income that it gives in aid . ) 
US aid also must be better targeted toward helping those living in extreme poverty . 
Regrettably , when then-Senator , now Vice-President Joe Biden was asked what spending an Obama administration might have to curtail because of the financial crisis , he mentioned the pledge to increase foreign aid . 
But doubling US foreign aid involves a modest amount of money , compared to what will be saved by pulling out of Iraq . 
Perhaps the most difficult aspect of turning the US into a good global citizen is cutting back on its grossly excessive greenhouse gas emissions - roughly five times the global per capita average . 
On this issue , the Bush administration wasted eight precious years during which we have gotten perilously close to the point at which an irreversible chain of events could occur that leads to catastrophe . 
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni last year accused the industrialized countries of committing aggression against Africa by causing global warming . 
That may sound like hyperbole , but raising the temperature and reducing the rainfall of a predominantly agricultural nation can be as devastating to its people as dropping bombs on it . 
Obama needs to make the US a leader in reducing emissions . 
Then , having demonstrated his good faith , he and European leaders should be able to work out a deal that will bring China and India into whatever agreement replaces the Kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . 
This may be the greatest ethical challenge of the Obama presidency , but , because so much hangs on it , the way in which he responds to it is likely to play a decisive role in how his presidency will be judged .
