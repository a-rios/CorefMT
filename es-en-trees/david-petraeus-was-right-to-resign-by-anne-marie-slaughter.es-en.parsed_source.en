Saving General Petraeus 
PRINCETON - The United States has moved from the high of a presidential election to the low of a political sex scandal in one short week . 
For many Americans , the election demonstrated what is best about the country , only to be followed by the sadly familiar process of knocking heroes off their pedestals . 
For many non-Americans , the election brought the welcome and reassuring victory of Barack Obama , whereas the resignation of David Petraeus as Director of the CIA was an unnecessary , self-inflicted wound . 
In fact , both the election and Petraeus &apos;s resignation are pieces of a larger whole : an America that lives up to its promises . 
The election reminded many Americans that the US is a country committed to and capable of progress - of moving forward toward an ideal vision . 
Obama was supported by a coalition of minorities : African-Americans , Latinos , Asian-Americans , Muslim-Americans , gay and lesbian Americans , and an under-represented majority - women - all of whom perceive continuing inequalities and injustices that need to be remedied . 
But the winners were all who believe that America is , in fact , dedicated to &quot; equal justice under law , &quot; the words emblazoned on the pediment of the Supreme Court . 
In the election of an African-American president less than a half-century after the end of official racial segregation in much of the country , these Americans see the triumph of the values enshrined in the US Constitution over America &apos;s legacy of social , political , and economic prejudice . 
They see a president committed to the advancement of all Americans , regardless of race , gender , creed , ethnic origin , sexual orientation , handicap , or economic status . 
They also see a country that truly does reflect the world , attracting immigrants from every nation and giving them an equal chance to succeed as Americans . 
And they see a president with a vision of a country that can rebuild its infrastructure , reform its health care , strengthen its educational system , and boost its economic prosperity in ways that require all citizens to contribute - and that will , in turn , allow all citizens to flourish . 
But how is this vision connected to the resignation of Petraeus , a storied and much-decorated general before he took over the CIA , following the revelation that he had an extra-marital affair ? 
Judging by my Twitter feed , most foreign observers simply cannot understand why a man serving his country in one of its highest and most sensitive positions should step down over something that happened in his private life - something that directly affects only those involved and their families . 
American culture , I explained , judges extra-marital affairs very harshly , so a senior official caught in such a position could easily be subject to blackmail - something that a CIA director , of all people , must avoid . 
Many Americans agree . 
From my perspective , however , Petraeus did the right thing : resigning was the only course open to him if he is to have any chance of repairing his reputation . 
Petraeus , after all , had been General Petraeus , a four-star general who had spent his life in the military , commanding the US missions in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
He graduated from - and later taught at - the US Military Academy at West Point , an institution guided by the motto &quot; Duty , Honor , Country . &quot; 
In our cynical age , many might scoff at such an old-fashioned motto ( or , indeed , at the power of any motto or slogan ) . 
West Point cadets do not . 
As General Douglas MacArthur told them in 1962 , those three words &quot; build your basic character . 
They mold you for your future roles as the custodians of the nation &apos;s defense . 
They make you strong enough to know when you are weak , and brave enough to face yourself when you are afraid . &quot; 
They teach you , he continued , &quot; to master yourself before you seek to master others ; to have a heart that is clean , a goal that is high . &quot; 
MacArthur &apos;s rhetoric is stirring ; some would say overblown . 
The ideals he expressed are lofty ; he himself fell short of them on more than one occasion . 
But , by and large , the men and women of the US military believe in these ideals and do their best to live up to them , just as US citizens generally believe in their Constitution &apos;s lofty words and seek to correct their national shortcomings . 
Petraeus violated his own personal code of honor and duty toward his wife and family - and thus , in his eyes , toward his country , particularly to the men and women whom he was entrusted to lead at the CIA . 
When his affair came to light , he faced up to his failure , took responsibility for the consequences , and did what he believed that duty , honor , and country required . 
The hubbub of tawdry disclosures and investigations addressing every aspect of a widening scandal may well last for weeks . 
In the meantime , Americans can only hope that their national elected representatives show an equal willingness to face up to and take responsibility for their failures , pettiness , and insistence on putting partisanship ahead of the country &apos;s manifest and urgent needs . 
These officials must now carry out their most fundamental duty : to govern . 
They must be willing to negotiate in good faith and compromise in order to enact laws , solve problems , avert crises , and build faith in the future . 
Let us hope that their oaths to defend and uphold the Constitution are more than just words .
