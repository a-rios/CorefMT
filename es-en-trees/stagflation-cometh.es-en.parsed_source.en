Stagflation Cometh 
New York - The world economy has had several good years . 
Global growth has been strong , and the divide between the developing and developed world has narrowed , with India and China leading the way , experiencing GDP growth of 11.1 % and 9.7 % in 2006 and 11.5 % and 8.9 % in 2007 , respectively . Even Africa has been doing well , with growth in excess of 5 % in 2006 and 2007 . 
But the good times may be ending . 
There have been worries for years about the global imbalances caused by America &apos;s huge overseas borrowing . 
America , in turn , said that the world should be thankful : by living beyond its means , it helped keep the global economy going , especially given high savings rates in Asia , which accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves . 
But it was always recognized that America &apos;s growth under President George W. Bush was not sustainable . 
Now the day of reckoning looms . 
America &apos;s ill-conceived war in Iraq helped fuel a quadrupling of oil prices since 2003 . 
In the 1970 &quot; s , oil shocks led to inflation in some countries , and to recession elsewhere , as governments raised interest rates to combat rising prices . 
And some economies faced the worst of both worlds : stagflation . 
Until now , three critical factors helped the world weather soaring oil prices . 
First , China , with its enormous productivity increases - based on resting on high levels of investment , including investments in education and technology Â­ - exported its deflation . 
Second , the United States took advantage of this by lowering interest rates to unprecedented levels , inducing a housing bubble , with mortgages available to anyone not on a life-support system . 
Finally , workers all over the world took it on the chin , accepting lower real wages and a smaller share of GDP . 
That game is up . 
China is now facing inflationary pressures . 
What &apos;s more , if the US convinces China to let its currency appreciate , the cost of living in the US and elsewhere will rise . 
And , with the rise of biofuels , the food and energy markets have become integrated . 
Combined with increasing demand from those with higher incomes and lower supplies due to weather-related problems associated with climate change , this means high food prices - a lethal threat to developing countries . 
Prospects for America &apos;s consumption binge continuing are also bleak . 
Even if the US Federal Reserve continues to lower interest rates , lenders will not rush to make more bad mortgages . 
With house prices declining , fewer Americans will be willing and able to continue their profligacy . 
The Bush administration is hoping , somehow , to forestall a wave of foreclosures - thereby passing the economy &apos;s problems on to the next president , just as it is doing with the Iraq quagmire . 
Its chances of succeeding are slim . 
For America today , the real question is only whether there will be a short , sharp downturn , or a more prolonged , but shallower , slowdown . 
Moreover , America has been exporting its problems abroad , not just by selling toxic mortgages and bad financial practices , but through the ever-weakening dollar , in part a result of flawed macro- and micro-policies . 
Europe , for instance , will find it increasingly difficult to export . 
And , in a world economy that had rested on the foundations of a &quot; strong dollar , &quot; the consequent financial market instability will be costly for all . 
At the same time , there has been a massive global redistribution of income from oil importers to oil exporters - a disproportionate number of which are undemocratic states - and from workers everywhere to the very rich . 
It is not clear whether workers will continue to accept declines in their living standards in the name of an unbalanced globalization whose promises seem ever more elusive . 
In America , one can feel the backlash mounting . 
For those who think that a well-managed globalization has the potential to benefit both developed and developing countries , and who believe in global social justice and the importance of democracy ( and the vibrant middle class that supports it ) , all of this is bad news . 
Economic adjustments of this magnitude are always painful , but the economic pain is greater today because the winners are less prone to spend . 
Indeed , the flip side of &quot; a world awash with liquidity &quot; is a world facing depressed aggregate demand . 
For the past seven years , America &apos;s unbridled spending filled the gap . 
Now both US household and government spending is likely to be curbed , as both parties &quot; presidential candidates promise a return to fiscal responsibility . 
After seven years in which America has seen its national debt rise from $ 5.6 trillion to $ 9 trillion , this should be welcome news - but the timing couldn &apos;t be worse . 
There is one positive note in this dismal picture : the sources of global growth today are more diverse than they were a decade ago . 
The real engines of global growth in recent years have been developing countries . 
Nevertheless , slower growth - or possibly a recession - in the world &apos;s largest economy inevitably has global consequences . 
There will be a global slowdown . 
If monetary authorities respond appropriately to growing inflationary pressure - recognizing that much of it is imported , and not a result of excess domestic demand - we may be able to manage our way through it . 
But if they raise interest rates relentlessly to meet inflation targets , we should prepare for the worst : another episode of stagflation . 
If central banks go down this path , they will no doubt eventually succeed in wringing inflation out of the system . 
But the cost - in lost jobs , lost wages , and lost homes - will be enormous .
