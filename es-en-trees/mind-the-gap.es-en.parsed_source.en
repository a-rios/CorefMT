Mind the Gap 
Within today &apos;s booming world economy , most developing countries have been growing rapidly . 
Yet this has not diminished the pressure to reduce the yawning gap in income between developed and developing countries that has shaped global debates for over a half-century . 
International inequalities , while large three decades ago , have worsened ever since . 
The most disturbing feature of this trend is the high number of &quot; growth collapses &quot; during the last decades of the twentieth century , with only a few developing economies ( East Asia , India ) able to sustain high growth rates . 
But there is another international income divergence that demands attention . 
Since 1980 , the world has witnessed a widening income gap among developing countries . 
As underscored by a recent United Nations report , World Economic and Social Survey 2006 , this &quot; dual divergence &quot; holds four key lessons for economic growth in the developing world . 
First , success and failure in achieving sustained economic growth appear to be concentrated in time and space . 
This means that the growth of individual developing countries depends not only on their domestic economic policies - the focus of debates on economic development in recent decades . 
It also depends on factors beyond the control of individual countries : global economic conditions and regional economic environments . 
Indeed , the recent boom in some parts of the developing world shows exactly that . 
Second , while pushing the technological frontier is the crucial element of growth in industrial countries , what matters for developing countries is transforming production and export structures , particularly by shifting resources to activities with higher levels of productivity . 
The key to achieving this is the capacity to diversify domestic production by generating new activities , strengthening economic linkages within the country , and creating new domestic technological capabilities . 
Building industrial and modern service sectors is critical for successful diversification . 
Conversely , de-industrialization and concentration of growth in informal service activities is a proven recipe for failure , as has been demonstrated by the sad experiences of most developing countries in recent decades . 
The form of integration into world markets also plays a central role in economic diversification . 
Countries that integrate into dynamic world markets for manufactures and services perform better than those that specialize in natural-resource intensive sectors . 
But exports are not the only key factor : even more important are the export sector &apos;s links with other domestic sectors . 
Pure extraction of mineral resources , as well as maquila -type manufacturing - common in Mexico and Central America - generate little additional demand for domestic industries and thus have only limited growth effects . 
A successful export strategy hinges not on how much countries export , but on what they export and how their export sectors are integrated with other domestic economic activities . 
The same is true of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) . 
Countries that benefit most from FDI are those whose domestic firms and institutions also benefit , and thus those that have the requisite absorptive capacity . 
Third , macroeconomic stability , investment , and growth are mutually reinforcing . 
But maintaining stability involves not only keeping inflation low , but also , and crucially , avoiding large swings in economic activity , external imbalances , and financial crises . 
This explains why , in a world where developing countries are faced with increasing shocks , macroeconomic policies aimed at smoothing the business cycle ( that is , counter-cyclical macro-economic policies ) play a vital role in economic growth . 
In recent decades , however , macroeconomic policy in most developing countries has become more pro-cyclical , largely exacerbating the volatility of international financial markets and commodity prices . 
Pro-cyclical fiscal adjustment tends to encourage a short-term orientation towards economic policy , which limits long-term investments in infrastructure and human capital , thus constraining growth . 
More fiscal space can be created by improving governance and strengthening the tax base , and , for the poorest countries , by achieving additional stable official development assistance ( ODA ) channeled through national budgets . 
Indeed , when ODA is not determined by geopolitics , it can have a strong positive effect on long-term growth , essentially because it supports investment in infrastructure and human development . 
Finally , institutional reform encompasses more than creating markets and guaranteeing property rights . 
It also includes creating the regulatory and institutional framework that markets require to function well , providing necessary public goods and guaranteeing the fairness of rules . 
&quot; Big bangs &quot; in institutional reform , however , may generate more harm than good . 
Minor and gradual institutional change can have a powerful impact on growth if it is perceived as initiating further credible reform . 
So what will it take to start closing international income gaps without damaging development prospects globally ? 
We need to maintain a stable , growing world economy with international trade rules that are truly development-oriented - the great expectation of the current ( but so far frustrated ) trade negotiations . 
This should be matched by the creation of &quot; supply capacities &quot; in developing countries , which requires production and trade sector policies that encourage structural transformation . 
We must also open up more space for counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies , approaching price stability less as an objective in itself than as an intermediate goal on the path to economic growth and employment creation . 
We need to ensure sustained levels of public spending to make the necessary investments in infrastructure and human capital , and to increase ODA channeled through the budgets of poor countries . 
Last but not least , we should promote gradual , home-made , and country-specific institutional reforms . 
By pursuing an aggressive , yet flexible , agenda for domestic development , facilitated by international cooperation and rules that guarantee the appropriate &quot; policy space &quot; for developing countries , we can reduce global income inequality . 
If we mind the gap , we can make the leap to a better , more inclusive form of globalization .
