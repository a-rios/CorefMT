Has Palestine Won ? 
TEL AVIV - The somber spectacle of Israel &apos;s isolation during the United Nations debate on Palestinian statehood marks the political tsunami that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s critics warned would arrive if Israel did not propose a bold peace initiative . 
But , more importantly , the speeches at the UN General Assembly by the two rivals , Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , showed that any initiative to bring the parties back to the negotiating table might turn out to be futile . 
Speeches do not make peace , but they can mar its prospects . 
Netanyahu and Abbas both showed once again how the politics surrounding &quot; the peace process &quot; has defeated the cause of peace . 
Both leaders exhibited utter indifference to the other &apos;s core concerns , and catered to their constituencies , Hamas and Israeli settlers included , making it clear , urbi et orbi , that the gaps separating their positions are as unbridgeable as ever . 
Netanyahu could not bring himself to admit the sins of occupation , or even to utter a minimal expression of empathy with the Palestinian tragedy of dispossession and dispersion . 
Israel &apos;s march of folly in expanding its West Bank settlements did not deserve a hint of soul searching on his part . 
Indeed , Netanyahu &apos;s call for peace will remain hollow so long as he continues to view the solution to Israel &apos;s legitimate security concerns as requiring continuous occupation of sizable portions of the future Palestinian state . 
The Jordan Valley and the hills of Judea and Samaria are , undoubtedly , strategic assets for a country whose width is that of the length of a Manhattan avenue . 
But demilitarization , the deployment of international forces , and rigid security arrangements could offer an answer . 
Security concerns can no longer be treated as a license for territorial expansion . 
Eager to deliver his elementary history lessons , Netanyahu refuses to admit the validity of one key perspective . 
Rather than interpreting Israel &apos;s victory in the 1967 Six-Day War as permission for annexation of territory , that triumph should be viewed as a watershed that made possible peace with the entire Arab world should Israel relinquish occupied Arab lands . 
This principle was stipulated by the 2002Arab peace initiative , and was previously realized in Israel &apos;s peace with Egypt and Jordan . 
So , whoever aspires to help the parties reach a settlement needs to be attentive to the fact that territorial borders are only one aspect of this conflict - and not necessarily the most contentious one . 
Unlike Israel &apos;s peace with Egypt ( and , one hopes , its peace with Syria ) , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is rooted in more than a real-estate dispute . 
As the UN debate showed , what is at stake is a clash of irreconcilable national narratives . 
Egypt had to grant Israel only political recognition , but the Palestinians are being asked to recognize Israel &apos;s moral legitimacy by accepting Jewish links to the Holy Land and hence admitting the Jews &quot; millenarian claim for a state in a land that the Palestinians believe is historically theirs . 
Not a word , nor an omission , in Abbas &apos;s UN speech was accidental . 
What was most striking was how flagrantly dismissive he was of Israel &apos;s most fundamental national narrative . 
He spoke of the Holy Land as the source of Christianity and the home of sacred shrines of Islam , but intentionally ignored the Biblical roots of Judaism and Jerusalem as the home of Hebrew kings and prophets . 
For Israelis , that omission reveals even the most moderate Palestinians &quot; unwillingness to embrace the existence of a Jewish state . 
Abbas &apos;s refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state - on the ground that to do so would betray Israel &apos;s 1.5 million Palestinian citizens - vindicated a key Israeli concern , and fueled skeptics &quot; fears of a hidden long-term Palestinian agenda to do away with the Jewish state altogether . 
This is likely to dishearten Israeli doves - and embolden hawks in their insistence that no progress toward peace is possible without the Palestinians &quot; unequivocal acceptance of Israel as the Jewish national homeland . 
Thus , Abbas &apos;s implicit message that Israel will never offer a fair deal to its Arab minority will reinforce Netanyahu &apos;s leadership as the staunch defender of the national interest against the na√Øve dreamers of the left . 
Netanyahu has only to present Abbas &quot; arguments as proof that , for the Palestinians , peace with Israel is just the first stage in a grand strategy leading to one Palestine , embracing all of Israel , with an Arab majority . 
Even if , as expected , the Security Council rejects the Palestinians &quot; request for full UN membership and Palestine ends up with observer status in the General Assembly , Abbas can already claim victory . 
He managed to redress the balance of power with Israel and the United States by mobilizing the vast support that the Palestinian cause elicits in the international community . 
If not for his bold initiative at the UN , the Quartet ( the UN , the US , the European Union , and Russia ) would not have become so suddenly hyperactive in searching for a formula to bring the parties back to the negotiating table . 
But don &apos;t hold your breath . 
Nothing will come out of the Quartet &apos;s move unless the parties change their attitudes . 
Peacemaking is about courageously addressing the other side &apos;s genuinely vital concerns . 
And would-be mediators , for their part , can no longer just be &quot; facilitators &quot; ; they need to regard themselves as stakeholders - and be prepared to exert pressure and twist arms . 
Left to their own devices , Israelis and Palestinians will never reach a comprehensive peace settlement .
