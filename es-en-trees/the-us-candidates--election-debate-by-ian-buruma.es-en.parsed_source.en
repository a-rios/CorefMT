American Presidential Beauty 
NEW YORK - What is the point of a presidential debate ? 
In the context of American presidential elections , &quot; debate &quot; is something of a misnomer . 
When former French President Nicolas Sarkozy faced his Socialist challenger , Fran√ßois Hollande , that was a debate - addressing substantive issues and lasting more than two hours . 
By contrast , presidential debates in the United States are more like staged performances , where the answers to every possible question have been rehearsed endlessly with teams of coaches and advisers . 
The candidates in US debates address carefully selected journalists who rarely follow up on a question . 
And the candidates &quot; performances are scrutinized less on the substance of their arguments than on their presentation , body language , facial tics , unguarded sighs , smiles , sneers , and inadvertent eye rolling . 
Does the candidate come across as a snob , or a friendly guy whom one can trust ? 
Do the smiles look real or fake ? 
These &quot; optics &quot; can be of great importance . 
After all , Richard Nixon &apos;s race against John Kennedy in 1960 is said to have been lost on television : Kennedy looked cool and handsome , while Nixon scowled into the camera , with sweat trickling down his five o &apos;clock shadow . 
In his debates with Ronald Reagan in 1980 , Jimmy Carter came across as smug and humorless , and Reagan as a friendly old uncle . 
Carter lost . 
In 2000 , Al Gore , was unable to make up his mind about which role he wished to play in his debates with George W. Bush , so he looked shifty and inauthentic , changing from arrogant to patronizing and back again . 
He had the better arguments , but he lost the &quot; debates &quot; ( and the election ) nonetheless . 
We are told that the debates this month between President Barack Obama and the Republican challenger , Mitt Romney , might decide the election . 
It is , according to the pundits , Romney &apos;s last chance . 
If Obama comes across as an elitist professor , he might lose . 
If Romney gets angry , or makes a bad joke , his chances could be blown . 
Again , this is not a question of who has the best policies , or the soundest ideas ; it is all about presentation . 
More than 67 million Americans watched the first of this year &apos;s three debates . 
According to public-opinion polls , only about 17 % of eligible voters have not yet made up their minds about which candidate to support . 
That is surprising , given the widening political gap between America &apos;s two main political parties . 
In private , Obama and Romney may be able to agree on many things . 
But the Republican Party has moved far to the right of Obama &apos;s moderate liberalism , and Romney has been pulled along with it . 
Then there is the great unspoken factor of racial prejudice , something even hard-core right-wing Republicans try not to express openly . 
A certain percentage of American voters will not vote for a black man , whatever he says , or however good he looks in a debate . 
If policies or prejudices have not persuaded that undecided 17 % of voters , they must be looking for something else . 
They want to see whether they like one man better than the other . 
To them , one can only assume , the debates are nothing more than a personality contest . 
In past elections , when there sometimes really was not much political difference between Democrats and Republicans , this made a certain sense . 
Broadly speaking , on economics and foreign policy , the candidates often would be in accord , with Republicans more inclined to favor the interests of big business and Democrats defending the interests of labor . 
So voters could not always be blamed for finding it hard to make up their minds . 
Since they could not make a rational choice , they followed their instincts and voted for the candidate they found most sympathetic . 
This time , there seems to be much less justification for such arbitrary choices . 
The political differences are too stark . 
And yet there is a reason not to dismiss the personality contest entirely . 
After all , the US presidency is a quasi-monarchical institution , as well as a political one . 
The president and First Lady are the king and queen of the American republic - the official faces that the US presents to the outside world . 
It is not utterly absurd , therefore , that voters want to like the look of their presidents , quite apart from the merit of their policies . 
Choosing the country &apos;s most powerful politician on the basis of his presentability on television might seem arbitrary , even frivolous . 
But it is no more arbitrary than the accident of birth , which determines the right of kings and queens to reign over their countries . 
The difference is , of course , that most modern kings and queens are constitutional monarchs with no political power . 
And the man whom US voters choose to lead their country will affect the lives of everyone , not just Americans . 
Because non-Americans cannot vote in US elections for him ( a pity for Obama , who would probably win a global vote by a landslide ) , we have to depend on the judgment of that 17 % of undecided voters watching television this month . 
That is not exactly reassuring . 
But the American republic has one merit that monarchies lack . 
Good or bad , the quasi-king can be booted out every four years . 
Then the competition - part ideological , part beauty contest - can start all over again .
