Russia &apos;s Road to Isolation 
Next week , Presidents Putin and Bush will meet in Slovakia . 
Mounting authoritarianism in Russia and Ukraine &apos;s Orange Revolution seem to have ended the honeymoon the two men had enjoyed . 
Sergei Karaganov , Chairman of Russia &apos;s Council on Foreign and Defense Policy , assesses Russia &apos;s deepening foreign policy problems . 
Two years ago , Russians could look at the world with satisfaction . 
We appeared stronger in the diplomatic arena than our economic and military power might warrant . 
Not anymore . 
There were some successes last year , the most important being that our foreign debt , which restricts our economic sovereignty , is close to being paid off . 
Otherwise , although Russia &apos;s objective strengths remain unchanged , our influence in international affairs has declined . 
From the Middle East to the war on terror and efforts to curtail the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , Russia should be a valuable partner . 
Yet no clear Russian &quot; footprint &quot; on these issues can be discerned . 
Indeed , even the growing split between Europe and America has not stemmed Russia &apos;s loss of standing . 
This turn of events is confusing . 
President Vladimir Putin remains a fairly effective international communicator . 
Yet Russia suffered several obvious defeats in 2004 that tarnished its image and undermined its standing in the world . 
In our immediate neighborhood , Belarus &apos;s President Alexander Lukashenko ignored warnings from Russia and went ahead with a referendum that enables him to remain president for life . 
Russia then focused almost all of its foreign policy attention on Ukraine , only to lose there , too . 
In the Far East , paying for past broken promises appears to have forced Russia to accept China &apos;s terms for resolving a border dispute . 
Of course , settling this long-festering dispute is to be welcomed , but the cost is that ceding territory has become a precedent . 
Moreover , Russia &apos;s dialogue with the European Union reached a dead end in 2004 . 
One reason is that the supposed resolution of the &quot; Kaliningrad problem &quot; - the Russian enclave cut off from Russia when Lithuania and Poland joined the EU - turned out to be no solution at all . 
This is not entirely Russia &apos;s fault ; but now the dialogue will have to be restarted , practically from scratch . 
Indeed , a chill is settling over Russia &apos;s relations with the West more broadly . 
So far , this is not disastrous , though it is difficult to read what the Western media have to say about Russia and its leadership . 
Almost all of the coverage is negative , and they have even started mocking us . 
Events in Belarus and Ukraine have made the Euro-Asian Economic Community project appear increasingly unrealistic . 
Our partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States have inevitably drawn conclusions from Russia &apos;s demonstration of weakness and incompetence . 
I could add more to this list , but that would merely be to rub salt into our wounds , which are my own as well . 
Russians should not lose heart ; but unless we understand the reasons for these failures , and make drastic corrections to our foreign policy , we are doomed to continue suffering defeats and losing status and influence , if not worse . 
The major cause of what has happened is the systematic intellectual weakness of Russia &apos;s foreign policy . 
Our knowledge and understanding of the rest of the world continues to deteriorate ; on many counts , we lack any system of foreign policy planning and forecasting . 
For example , the Ukraine debacle could have been avoided had we evaluated the political situation in a timely manner and backed the candidate who was practically certain to win . 
But we placed amateurs in charge of dealing with Ukraine - amateurs with far-reaching commercial interests . 
When Putin was dragged in to cover up the mess , an ordinary failure turned into a total fiasco . 
In fact , Russia &apos;s foreign policy is Putin personified : the president decides and executes almost everything . 
The Foreign Ministry , home to the state &apos;s best personnel , has been largely cut off from diplomatic planning . 
The Security Council is practically invisible . 
As a result , even good decisions are incompletely planned . 
Moreover , responsibility for foreign affairs is often given to whichever &quot; commissioner &quot; happens to turn up . 
This approach accounts for the failure of Dmitri Kozak &apos;s plan for resolving the situation in Moldova &apos;s breakaway Trans-Dniester region , as well as for the ludicrous state of affairs that has arisen in Georgia &apos;s separatist Abkhazia region . 
The fundamental weakness of Russia &apos;s emerging political system , with its excessive centralization , its reliance on individual personnel rather than institutions , and the declining quality of its management , is starting to show . 
Russia &apos;s ruling elite is increasingly failing to measure up to Russia &apos;s capabilities and needs . 
As our failures mount , we snarl and blame others , or construct imaginary plans for countering the great powers . 
Thus far , we have been half-forgiven for doing so . 
Russia is tactically necessary . 
But the outside world &apos;s assessment of Russia &apos;s policies and prospects are visibly changing for the worse . 
This is not due solely to our foreign policy , or even to dubious economic policies . 
Few believe it is possible to strengthen Russia by creating an almost Soviet-style political system , but without that system &apos;s main state-forming component - the Communist Party and its ideology . 
As a result , the past 12-18 months have seen a shift in perceptions of Russia : from a strengthening partner and potential ally to a weakening rival . 
Russia needs a serious discussion , within the elite and among the public , about national strategy , just as it needs to create an effective planning and coordination mechanism for foreign policy . 
Substantial corrections will be required to the entire political agenda , which , multiplied by the astonishing ideology of building national capitalism in one country , is currently too reminiscent of the policies that led to the Soviet Union &apos;s disintegration . 
As it is , Russia is moving towards becoming a bigger version of Venezuela or Nigeria - oil-rich and dysfunctional - rather than towards becoming a great European or Eurasian power of the future .
