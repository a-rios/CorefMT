Quo Vadis , Iran ? 
BERLIN - Iran is in the process of wasting the biggest historical opportunity the country has had since the revolution of 1979 , and perhaps even in the last hundred years . 
This opportunity is called Barack Obama . 
It is Obama &apos;s policy of reaching out to Iran that offers the country this unique opportunity - if , and it &apos;s a big &quot; if , &quot; the Iranian leadership takes it up . 
At the moment , however , little if anything suggests that this will happen , because , for Iran &apos;s leaders , Obama &apos;s offer also represents a grave danger . 
There is nothing they fear as much as opening up and reducing tension with America . 
Indeed , the regime welcomed George W. Bush and his neo-con administration , because it allowed Iran &apos;s leaders to close ranks , and at the same time delivered free access to influence in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Like all partial modernizers in authoritarian regimes , Iran &apos;s rulers want an advanced economy , technology , and infrastructure , but not freedom , democracy or the rule of law . 
This explains their great fear of , indeed an obsession with , &quot; color revolutions , &quot; although they are de facto working hard to bring one about . 
The ongoing drama of mass demonstrations , violence , torture and repression that followed June &apos;s fraudulent election has exposed a fundamental conflict within the Iranian power elite about the basic course of the Islamic Republic . 
Does the country seek increased openness or isolation ? 
Integration or destabilization ? 
The decisions are anything but final , even though the isolationists now prevail . 
Although Ayatollah Khomeini &apos;s revolution of 1979 defined itself as Islamic , at its core it was and remains a national revolution , its most important aim being the nation &apos;s independence from the influence of foreign powers . 
Thirty years later , Obama &apos;s offer would enable Iran not just to consolidate its independence through reconciliation with the United States , but also to live up to its increased significance within the region and in world politics . 
The dream of Iran &apos;s resurgence as a great power and civilization could be realized in unison with the major regional and global powers , rather than ending in the nightmare of confrontation . 
Iran &apos;s current leadership , however , has obviously bet on the nightmare option . 
What is visible in the current crisis is that the Iranian revolution against the Shah was not the first Islamic revolution , but one of the last Third World anti-colonial revolts - the end rather than the beginning of an historical era . 
One of the first successful revolutions of this kind , and certainly the most important , took place in China in 1949 . 
Numerous successful national liberation movements in Asia , Africa , and Latin America followed . 
They were usually anti-Western in orientation , and for good reason . 
Many of these revolutions opted for the Soviet economic model , which combined a state-controlled economy with a minimal degree of integration into the world market . 
For this , many countries involved paid a high price . 
Iran &apos;s leadership would do well to study these cases carefully . 
Indeed , the Soviet Union itself eventually collapsed because of its shortage economy , not a lack of missiles and nuclear warheads . 
Its demise could not be averted by the country &apos;s abundance of oil and natural gas . 
But Iran &apos;s rulers apparently don &apos;t want to learn from history . 
Instead , they are valiantly pinning their hopes on the old decolonization / nationalist strategy , nowadays even resorting to such Stalinist tools as staged show trials . 
In the long run , though , rule by bayonet rarely works . 
Of course , all the partial modernizers in China , Russia , Vietnam , and other countries share a fear of &quot; colored revolutions , &quot; the non-violent upheavals that brought democracy to Georgia , Ukraine , and Lebanon in recent years . 
There are still a few unreformed &quot; Socialist &quot; states left : North Korea and Cuba , for example , even a couple new acolytes : Venezuela and Bolivia . 
But these countries are unable to develop independently and lack a global power alternative . 
All they will leave behind for their people is another wasted chance , with shattered hopes and unpaid bills . 
And it is more to the pitiful remains of the anti-colonial revolutions in Latin America than to the community of Islamic states that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is drawn . 
The outcome of this stance looks even gloomier if Iranians compare themselves with India , Brazil , and Turkey . 
The impressive success of these countries has showcased the economic , social , and technological preconditions for becoming a regional or even global power in the twenty-first century . 
In the medium term , Iran &apos;s main competitor in the region will be neither Israel nor its Arab neighbors , but Turkey . 
While Iran suppresses internal freedom , relies on a foreign policy of regional destabilization , and concentrates on developing nuclear weapons , which will reduce rather than enhance its security , Turkey is undergoing a process of successful and comprehensive modernization . 
As a result , Turkey , not Iran , is on track to become this century &apos;s key Middle Eastern power . 
This autumn , important decisions must be made , because the uranium enrichment process continues unabated in Iran . 
Indeed , Iran is getting very close to the red line of being able to produce nuclear weapons . 
Its leadership must therefore decide whether to take the hand offered by Obama or lead the region into a new phase of confrontation . 
A look at history books could help them make the decision .
