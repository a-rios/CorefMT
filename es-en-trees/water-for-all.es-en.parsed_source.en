Water for All 
This month , water once again takes center stage at the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City . 
It is an opportune moment : while much of the world &apos;s attention has been fixed on issues of energy supply and security , hundreds of millions of people in the developing world continue to see the supply and security of fresh water as equally , if not more , important . 
Surveys undertaken by the World Bank in developing countries show that , when poor people are asked to name the three most important concerns they face , &quot; good health &quot; is always mentioned . 
And a key determinant of whether they will have good health or not is access to clean water . 
More than a billion people around the world today do not . 
As a result , they are increasingly vulnerable to poor health . 
The World Bank estimates that by 2035 , as many as three billion people , almost all of them in developing countries , could live under conditions of severe water stress , especially if they happen to live in Africa , the Middle East , or South Asia . 
This will cause obvious hardship , but it will also hold back the economic growth needed for millions of people to escape poverty . 
In Latin America , about 15 % of the population - roughly 76 million people - do not have access to safe water , and 116 million people do not have access to sanitation services . 
The figures are worse in Africa and parts of Asia . 
This is a situation that few people in rich countries face . 
Generally , these countries &quot; citizens enjoy services that provide for all water needs , from drinking to irrigation to sanitation . 
In addition , other water-related issues , such as the risks posed by flooding , have been reduced to manageable levels . 
Rich industrial countries have invested early and heavily in water infrastructure , institutions , and management capacities . 
The result , beyond the health benefits for all , has been a proven record of economic growth ; one only has to look at investment in hydropower to see the positive impact of water management projects on many economies . 
Granted , rich countries have a certain advantage : they benefit from generally moderate climates , with regular rainfall and relatively low risks of drought and flooding . 
Even so , they are not immune to water-related disasters , as Hurricane Katrina &apos;s destruction of New Orleans taught us . 
But the impact of such events on poor countries is much greater . 
Extreme rainfall variations , floods , and droughts can have huge social and economic effects and result in the large-scale loss of life . 
The Gulf coast of Mexico and Central American countries has repeatedly experienced such tragedies , with poor communities the most vulnerable and the least able to cope . 
Ethiopia and Yemen are equally stark examples . 
Ethiopia &apos;s development potential is closely tied to seasonal rains , so high rainfall variation , together with lack of infrastructure , has undermined growth and perpetuated poverty . 
A single drought can cut growth potential by 10 % over an extended period . 
Yemen , for its part , has no perennial surface water ; its citizens depend entirely on rainfall , groundwater , and flash flooding . 
To move forward , developing countries need new water infrastructure and better management . 
Any approach must be tailored to the circumstances of each country and the needs of its people , but there is no fundamental constraint to designing water development investments that ensure that local communities and the environment gain tangible and early benefits . 
In some countries , new water infrastructure may mean canals , pumping stations , and levees . 
Still others might need deeper reservoirs , more modern filtration plants , or improved water transport schemes . 
These can all potentially be designed to improve and expand water supplies for power generation , irrigation , and household and industrial use , while providing security against droughts and protection from floods . 
The key to successful increased investment in water infrastructure is an equally increased investment in water institutions . 
Badly managed infrastructure will do little to improve peoples &quot; health or support economic growth , so water development and water management must go hand in hand . 
Water infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with sound institutions , good governance , great attention to the environment , and an equitable sharing of costs and benefits . 
A water investment policy that reduces the vulnerability of the poor and offers basic water security for all will require customized planning and an effective partnership of donor countries , developing country governments , the private sector , and local communities . 
Delegates to the World Water Forum will have ample opportunity to forge and / or strengthen these partnerships . 
If they succeed , the rewards for the world &apos;s poor will be immense .
